      "selftext": "I jumped into the event rental business (weddings, parties, etc) in June 2024. I realized how lucrative the wedding industry is and after spending a couple months watching TheRentalGuy on YouTube, I decided to take a shot.\n\nI had no idea how small or large I wanted to be. So, as most of us do, I faked it until I made it. After the LLC, I created a logo and put a listing on Facebook marketplace for table and chair rentals — the standard white padded chairs, round and rectangular tables. I posted about 8pm on a Friday and by 8:30pm I received my first booking… for a 300 person party! I owned nothing. I almost turned it down but instead I decided to ensure it was legitimate by meeting for a cash 50% deposit. I then spent $10k purchasing the equipment new (the rental was for $1500 a few months later, so I had time).\n\nI made 8k that August-December, then in 2025 business picked up about February again (seasonal) and I cleared just at 40k by EOY.\n\nThe 2 things I underestimated the most was the sheer size and space you need — I ran it out of a 16x22 detached garage. I had enough room to move around but had to be strategic. The other thing is the maintenance (chairs mainly). The white chairs need to be cleaned about half the time after being rented out. That takes most of my time. The preparation. I have some late Friday nights if I push it off until then to prep for the weekend, but on the weekends I’m spending maybe 3-4 hours before noon each day delivering and picking up. Some weeks a lot less work depending on the shape of the equipment and different factors.\n\nIt is the least passive of income there is. I’ve since purchased an enclosed trailer. And I’m worn out a lot.  If I can say no anytime. But on the other hand, once it’s paid off, it sure if nice to make a random $500 for maybe 2 hours worth of work on a Saturday morning. Between March and October, some weekends I make $200, others I make $3000. It’s solely up to how much time and inventory you have.\n\nYear 1 was a larger scale than I expected and I spread myself thin at times but I can scale back as much as I want. Even with 1/4 the equipment, a lot of $ can be made. It’s a great side hustle if you have the physical ability.",

The catch is nobody tells you about it, obviously they are not going to announce that stuff, you have to go find it yourself.  \n  \nEach claim takes maybe 15-20 min, most don't even need receipts, just need you to confirm you used whatever service during the right dates, I've gotten checks for $8 and checks for $340. average is probably around $75, but just know that it takes time  \n  \nAt first I was just googling and checking sites manually, it was okay but I couldnt remember all the services I used like 4 years ago (I cant even remember what I had for lunch yesterday lol), around june I tried using settlemate bc it flags based on actual purchases and accounts, I try to batch them, knock out 3-4 claims during lunch or while watching something.  \n  \nThe downsides are real tho, money is slow as hell, some pay in 6 weeks, some take like 8 months, you need patience, also this isn't replacing actual income, it's more like the same category as survey apps or cashback stuff, small effort, small returns, but it adds up.  \n  \nIf you're already doing beer money type things this fits right in, won't make you rich but $1200 for maybe 10 total hours of work spread across the year really helped me, I track everything in a spreadsheet so I know what's pending vs what already hit.",

After about three weeks I had maybe $10–20 worth of gift cards/points across everything and one app hit a payout threshold that took forever to reach. A couple of apps (Mistplay was one I tried) gave small rewards here and there but also felt like a grind, and one locked my account for a day which was annoying. \n\nIt wasn't a scam, more like a low-value time sink for me , fine if you want something mindless while watching Netflix, but not something I'd call a reliable side hustle.

One of our main selling points was that it worked offline and added tasks even without the internet. We tested the hell out of it. service workers, cache API, the whole deal. And it  worked flawlessly and we were so proud.\n\nNow, Fast forward to last week. Our app store rating 3.1 stars\n\nthe reviews were brutal \"offline mode doesn't work. tried on plane, nothing saved\"\n\n\"says it works offline but lost all my tasks when Wi-Fi came back\"\n\n\"false advertising tbh\"\n\nI was SO confused because it worked perfectly for me. opened dev tools, went offline, added tasks, went back online - everything synced. Then i checked our analytics chrome users: offline mode success rate 94% safari users offline mode success rate 38%\n\noh no!!!. We got to know that safari's service worker implementation is... how do i put this nicely like it’s Complete garbage. Specifically, Safari doesn't cache POST requests with service workers. Our app's core action was submitting a new task (POST request). So when iOS users went offline and added tasks, the service worker just... silently failed. they'd see the task in the UI (optimistic update), reconnect to Wi-Fi, and Boom!!! it's gone.\n\nI shipped a flagship feature that literally didn't work for 60% of mobile users.\n\nAnd the worst part? i only tested on chrome. my MacBook, my android phone, chrome dev tools. never once opened safari dev tools. We spent the last 4 days rebuilding with indexedDB + a sync queue that batches requests when connection returns. Now it actually works on safari. The new ratings were 4.2 stars and climbing.\n\nNow suggestions….If you're building a PWA and marketing offline functionality, TEST ON SAFARI and I would suggest testing it on drizz(dot)dev or xyz or any other tool out there. And don’t just \"open it and click around\" but actually profile the service worker behavior. safari and chrome are not the same.\n\nAnd from now ain’t no way we are using \"works offline!\" as a marketing point again….\n\n until we've tortured tested it on every browser lol….\n\n",

I’m not trying to rush things, just testing the waters and learning as I go.\n\nI’ve been using Snappic so far, and it’s been okay. It gets the job done, but before I invest more time and money or lock myself into one setup long-term, I want to make sure I’m choosing something that fits how I actually work. Since this isn’t my main job, I care a lot about simple setup, stability during live events, and not having to troubleshoot when guests are waiting.\n\nI’d love to hear from people who explored different options before scaling up. What are you using now, and what made you trust it enough to keep going?",

      "selftext": "I work full time and I have two young kids so I’ve been casually exploring side hustle ideas. I recently started looking into Amazon affiliate marketing and using Pinterest. Further, we are a huge Disney family and I have a constant Disney itch to scratch. \n\nWhat is the reality of creating a Disney focused Pinterest account and creating different themed or focused boards and populating them with pins for affiliate links. Is there any potential in this? Like I said I’m an extreme newbie, but I’m trying to narrow down my interest and what paths to explore. \n\nIf this isn’t a good idea, should I start somewhere else with affiliate marketing? A different subject matter? Different sites? ",

          "body": "Honestly? The Disney niche on Pinterest is rough. Super saturated. Everyone's trying to pin ears and castle photos for affiliate links.\n\nBut... it's not impossible. You gotta go hyper-specific. Not \"Disney vacations.\" Think \"Disneybounding on a budget for preschool moms\" or \"stroller-friendly snack spots in Epcot.\" Boards that solve a real, tiny problem.\n\nI tried a family travel Pinterest account for like 6 months. Took forever to get any traction. Creating fresh pins constantly is a second job. With two kids and full-time work... I burned out fast.\n\nWhat changed for me was shifting to a more automated approach. I still use Pinterest a bit, but I don't rely on it for all my traffic. I started using Bradley Woods Affiliate Mentor to handle the backend stuff I had no time for—finding offers, tracking links, that whole side. It let me focus on just making a few good pins instead of trying to be a full-time content machine.\n\nIf you're set on Disney, go for it, but niche down hard. Otherwise, maybe test a subject you already know that's less crowded? Kitchen gadgets, favorite kids' books, something where you're not drowning in pixie dust.",

      "selftext": "This is gonna sound super niche but I started renting out baby stuff to tourists through the internet about 11 months ago and its turned into way better income than I expected.\n\nI live near a popular spring destination and we get tons of families visiting for sports events and vacations. Parents don't wanna fly with car seats, cribs, strollers, all that bulky stuff so they just rent it when they get here. I started with a car seat and pack n play I bought secondhand for like $80 total, cleaned them up real good and listed them.\n\nFirst month I made maybe $200 but then summer hit and I was getting $600-800 monthly. Now I've got 6 car seats, 3 cribs, 2 strollers, a high chair and some other random stuff. Last month I cleared $1,240 and I probably spent 4 hours total on dropoffs and pickups.\n\nThe best part is most of the gear just sits in my garage between rentals. I'll get a booking notification, confirm it, drop the stuff off at their hotel or rental, then pick it up when they leave. Sometimes I don't even see them cause they leave it with the front desk. Takes 20 mins max per rental.\n\nInitial investment was around $900 from Stаke for everything and I hit break even after month 3. Now its pretty much pure profit minus the occasional replacement if something breaks. Been throwing most of it toward my emergency fund which needed some padding anyway.\n\nOnly annoying part is when people are weird about used gear even though everything gets sanitized between uses. Had one lady ask if the car seat was \"certified clean\" like there's some official baby gear certification lmao. But 95% of people are super chill and just happy they dont have to lug their own stuff through the airport.",

          "body": "The comments are ridiculous... people are giving you trouble for 30 minutes of cleaning and saying it's not passive income. No income is truly passive income, there is always some work that needs to go into it. I think this is good enough because you technically could hire a cleaner, but since it's such a small space and conveniently attached to the house, you don't really need to. \n\nFurthermore, all these people questioning the 30min clean-time probably aren't considering the fact that these are mostly short stays and a very small space as you mentioned (300sqft I believe). If it takes you 2+ hours to clean 300sqft space after someone lived in it for 2-3 days, then I would be quite concerned about your efficiency or the tenants themselves. \n\nI used to live in an 800 sqft apartment years ago and it would only take me 30min every few days to upkeep my place. This includes running a robot vacuum, doing a second pass with my dyson, mopping, running dishwasher, dusting and cleaning a single washroom. Once in a while (maybe every 1-2 months), I'll do a deep clean which would take an hour. I've received multiple compliments about cleanliness from guests + I'm OCD as well. \n\nSo really not sure why people are questioning you at all. ",

      "selftext": "I'm an accountant and last June I was watching TikTok at midnight when I saw some faceless account explaining credit cards with 2 million views. I thought I could do that and made my first video the next day.\n\nGot 147 views. My mom didn't even watch it.\n\nMade 11 more videos over three weeks. Highest was 380 views. Gave up for a month because it felt pointless. Then in August I posted one about savings accounts and it randomly got 50k views overnight. No idea why that one worked.\n\nThat's when I actually tried. The free text to speech sounded awful so I switched to APOB for the avatar stuff. It's not perfect, someone commented \"bro sounds like he's underwater\" which was fair, but I can make a video in 15 minutes now.\n\nI post 3 or 4 times a week after dinner. Account is at 7400 followers. Some videos get 30k views, some get 900. I made one explaining APR that I thought was solid and it died at 600 views. Then made one about Costco memberships as a joke and it got 40k. Algorithm is completely random.\n\nMoney breakdown last month: $47 from creator fund, $248 from affiliate link in my bio, had 31 people sign up for a budgeting app I actually use, and $45 from three people who Venmo'd me to answer credit questions which was weird but whatever. Total $340.\n\nThis month is tracking around $280. It's not consistent and definitely not quit your job money but it covers internet, Spotify, and usually leaves enough for drinks on the weekend. Takes maybe 2 hours a week total.\n\nWeirdest part is people think I'm some finance guru now. Someone asked me to manage their portfolio. I'm an accountant at a mid size firm, I just know how credit cards work because I explained it to my little brother five times.\n\nAlso had someone spam \"is this AI\" on every video so I started responding \"yes I'm a robot beep boop\" and they stopped.\n\nIf you're thinking about this just pick something you know and start posting. First 15 videos will probably suck. One will randomly hit and you'll figure it out. Don't expect thousands of dollars but $200-300 a month for basically no effort is doable.\n\nStill think it's kind of dumb but my roommate stopped making fun of me after I paid for pizza with TikTok money so I guess that's something.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been researching side hustles that actually work for my newsletter but every post it’s the same recycled advice. Start a podcast. Sell printables. Drive for DoorDash. Do surveys. I got tired of seeing the same surface-level ideas repeated by people who clearly weren’t doing any of them.\n\nSo I went deep into Reddit threads, Discord servers, and niche communities to find what’s actually working for regular people right now.\n\nHere’s what kept coming up again and again\n\n1. AI-generated influencer accounts\n\nThis one sounds wild but it’s real. People are creating entirely AI-generated personas using tools like Midjourney, Flux, and HeyGen, then running them as influencer accounts on Instagram and TikTok.\n\nThe persona posts content around a niche like fitness, finance, or tech reviews. Brand deals still come in because engagement is what matters, not whether the face is real. Some people are running two or three of these at once.\n\nThe key is picking a tight niche and staying consistent with the character so the audience feels like they’re following a real person.\n\n2. Hyperlocal newsletters\n\nThis is one of the most underrated plays out there. People are starting simple email newsletters covering local news, events, restaurant openings, and community stuff for their city or neighborhood. You write one or two emails a week using a free tool like Beehiiv or Substack.\n\nOnce you hit a few thousand subscribers, local businesses will pay surprisingly well to sponsor a slot. It works because big media ignores small towns and neighborhoods, so there’s almost no competition.\n\nA guy in a mid-sized suburb shared that he’s pulling in over two thousand a month just from a twice-weekly newsletter about his area.\n\n3. Claude chatbot setups for small businesses\n\nSmall business owners keep hearing about AI but have no idea how to actually use it. People are charging anywhere from three hundred to over a thousand dollars to set up Claude-powered chatbots and workflows for local businesses.\n\nThink automated customer support for a dentist’s office, a booking assistant for a salon, or a lead qualifier for a contractor. You use tools like Claude, Zapier, and Make to wire it all together. No coding needed.\n\nOnce you’ve built a few, you can reuse templates and the work gets faster every time. Most clients will come from cold outreach or local Facebook groups.\n\n4. Amazon KDP low-content and AI-assisted books\n\nKindle Direct Publishing is still quietly printing money for people who understand the system. The sweet spot right now is using AI to help research niches, outline content, and draft specialized nonfiction like study guides, prompt collections, niche how-to books, and curated resource lists. You’re not publishing AI slop novels.\n\nThe people doing well are targeting very specific keywords with real demand and thin competition. One person shared they were making around fifteen hundred a month from a catalog of about forty short books, most of which took a day or two each to put together.\n\n5. Twitter ghostwriting\n\nBuilding a personal brand on X is a grind, but plenty of founders, executives, and creators are willing to pay someone else to do it for them. Ghostwriters handle everything from drafting daily posts to writing long threads and managing engagement.\n\nPay ranges from five hundred to several thousand per month per client depending on scope. If you can write in a punchy, opinionated style and understand what performs well on the platform, this is steady recurring income.\n\nMost ghostwriters land their first clients by simply being active on X themselves and DMing people whose accounts look neglected.\n\n6. No-code iOS apps\n\nTools like FlutterFlow, Adalo, and Draftbit have made it possible to build and ship real apps to the App Store without writing a line of code.\n\nPeople are building simple utility apps, habit trackers, niche calculators, and local service directories, then monetizing through subscriptions or one-time purchases. The barrier to entry is lower than ever.\n\nOne person in a community I follow launched a niche workout timer app and was making around eight hundred a month within three months. The trick is solving a very specific problem for a very specific audience rather than trying to compete with big apps.\n\nNone of these require a massive upfront investment or some rare technical skill. They just take consistency and willingness to learn new things.\n\nI have written detailed posts about these on my [newsletter](http://wifimoolah.com). It’s free and I do not sell anything\n\nHas anyone here tried any of these or found other low-key hustles that are actually working right now?",

There are mechanisms to basically rent all these things individually or as a group and collect rent/passive income.  \n\n\nAnother term for passive income is rent.  Even when you put money into 4% bank account, you are essentially renting money to the bank (so they can lend it out to bottowers at higher rate)\n\n\nEverything else is essentially a job.  Sometimes you can work to create an asset that can get passive income in the future.  You can build a house with your hands, you can create a copyright song, you can create and patent a toy/device.  You created an asset and now you can rent it out. ",

          "body": "One of the most boring but reliable paths is skill based freelancing that eventually turns into repeat clients. It is not passive at first, but once you build a few steady clients or retainers, it becomes predictable monthly income. The unsexy part is doing outreach and starting conversations. I have helped many freelancers land their first clients using a simple outreach based method, and once they had 3 to 5 steady clients, income became much more stable.\n\nDigital products are another boring but steady model. Simple templates, planners, niche guides, or industry specific resources created once and sold repeatedly on platforms like Gumroad or Etsy. It usually takes a few months of testing and improving, but once one product gains traction, it can quietly generate monthly sales without much maintenance.\n\nNiche websites also fall into this category. Writing helpful articles around specific problems, monetized with affiliate links or ads, is slow at the beginning. For the first several months, it can feel like nothing is happening. But once content ranks and traffic compounds, it can turn into steady revenue. It is not glamorous, and it requires patience.\n\nPrint on demand is similar. Upload designs, test niches, optimize listings. Most designs will not sell much. But a few that connect with a niche audience can produce consistent monthly sales over time. It is repetitive work, not exciting work.\n\nDividends and index funds are probably the most boring of all. They require capital and time, and the returns look small at the beginning. But they are predictable and compound over the long term.\n\nThe pattern across all of these is the same. None of them are fast. Most take 3 to 12 months before they feel meaningful. What makes them work is choosing one, building systems around it, and sticking with it long enough for compounding to kick in.\n\nThe most unsexy income streams are usually the ones built on consistency and simple repeatable processes rather than viral wins.\n\nI’ve been breaking down these strategies step by step in my newsletter, you can find the link in my bio if you are interested.",

I personally have yet to try Prolific, but I was consistently making an extra $200 a month (\\~30min a day for 6 months) from doing surveys on cloud until I got banned for speeding through them, something I forgot they were against in their tos.\n\nYouTube - If you watch streamers, take clips from their streams, edit them, and upload them to youtube. I haven't made any money doing this yet, but I got a brand new channel to 800 subscribers and 650k views in just a month doing exactly what I just described. I've seen people making $10-20k a month doing this, but I think $100-300 is much more realistic.\n\nDaytrading - WAIT, I know how much flak it gets, but that's just because of how it's presented. People act as if it'll make you rich quick, which to be fair, it can, but a good rule of thumb is that if something could make you rich quick, it could make you poor quicker, so be careful and do a lot of research if you decide to do this. With strong pattern recognition, a ***LOT*** of discipline, and some common sense, you could definitely make a few extra $100s a month with this.\n\nTheme Pages - Find a niche (memes, beauty, cars, gaming, ect.) and make an instagram/yt/tiktok with it. After enough growth, companies will pay you thousands of dollars per post to promote their products/services. You could also do this to grow your own business, if you're interested in that.\n\nThese are the best ways that I know of that anyone could make an extra $1k a month. With all the information available to us nowadays, most of these are actually pretty easy, but they'll take a while, and you'll have to be extremely consistent, which is the real hard part.",

I kept copying tactics without really understanding *why* they work.\n\nWhat finally helped was keeping it simple: one small PDF, one clear problem, basic funnel, and light ads. First sale wasn’t life-changing money, but it proved something important — **strangers will pay if the offer makes sense**.\n\nOnce that clicked, it stopped feeling like luck and more like a system you can improve.\n\nI’m still early, but if anyone’s curious about how I structured it or what I’d do differently now, happy to share what I learned.

FYI- I run fanpages of celebrities.\n\nCurrently I am only focusing on YT and FB, my story- [ https://www.reddit.com/r/passive\\_income/s/Rl5N9PbBQw ](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/s/Rl5N9PbBQw)",

Running 10 fanpages though means you're probably drowning in repetitive DMs and comments asking the same stuff over and over, which cuts into time you could spend scaling or creating better content. One thing that might help with the engagement overload is setting up better automated responses for teh FAQ stuff.\n\nI've read about creators using tools like Isonic that convert your existing content into a chatbot so fans can get instant answers without you being glued to your phone. It supposedly helps capture sales from people who would otherwise just ghost after asking questions. Worth looking into if you're trying to monetize those fan interactions more efficiently without adding hours to your day.\n\nEither way, what you've built is solid. The fact that you're thinking about group calls and paid consultations shows you're already thinking like a real business owner.",

      "selftext": "About 6 months ago I started a small online baby clothes store as a side income.Just a basic website with a few designs\n\nTbh the first two to three months were depressing. Nearly all of my sales came from friends, neighbors and people I personally told. The store had customers but no matter how much I changed the prices or the pictures strangers weren't purchasing.\n\nThen I started searching like a customer like newborn winter outfits or best baby clothes brands. My brand did not show up. Thats when I realized people simply couldn’t find my store.\n\nWhat I actually did:\n\n* Updated product descriptions using language that customers really use to find\n* Added basic FAQs parents usually worry about (sizing, fabric comfort and washing)\n* Wrote simple guides to help first-time parents choose outfits\n* reorganized the categories to make the website easier to use.\n* I focused on the appropriate descriptions and instructions by using a tool to determine which places and search terms were bringing attention to my products.\n\nThese days the store consistently generates monthly sales and I probably put in two to three hours a week to maintain it. Although its not enough to quit your job it feels at last somewhat passive than before\n\nAnyone here started something new this year or next year? What worked for you? Share your experiences\n\n",

What model are you using? How long are your prompts? How detailed are your images? Are you providing reference images? How much \"slop\" tolerance do you have?   \n    \nThe other thing I'd mention to people interested in starting something like this: The \"rollercoaster\" sucks because on social media you're at the mercy of the platform. It's incredibly frustrating to see your account growing well across all metrics, and then suddenly have your earnings rate plummet for seemingly no reason. Or to have your best earnings week to date, followed by a week of your reach being in freefall. I'm currently in one of these \"wtf is happening?!\" phases right now and it sucks.",

Building a content site or YouTube channel during those 1 to 2 hours could compound over time. Takes months before it pays anything but once it's rolling the income is fairly passive.

I had zero knowledge of AI, automation, or software. ADHD helped in one way (ambition and optimism), but hurt in another (too many tools, monthly fees, and underuse). So I forced simplicity.\n\nOne day, alone in a hotel room with no phone, I spent hours talking to ChatGPT. I realised I didn’t lack ideas — I lacked *patterns*: what lots of people consistently want, urgently, and will pay for. So instead of asking “What can I launch fast?”, I asked “What system makes sense long-term?” I studied search behaviour in high-population countries, focusing on real pain, not curiosity. One rule: simple setup + fully automated.\n\nI tested a few options, picked one, and built it using a small stack:\n\n* **ChatGPT** for creativity and ideation\n* **Claude** to design/build the website and system\n* **Perplexity** for deep research.\n* Then I used **Cloudflare** (hosting and Workers automation), **Stripe** (payments), **MailerLite/Brevo** (emails), and **HTMLtoPDF** (to convert results into a PDF report).\n\nThe model was simple: a free personalised report for a specific sector, and a paid premium version delivered automatically. No calls, no onboarding, no consulting, no manual fulfilment. It runs on its own — and it has reached **€100k** in fully automated revenue.\n\nIf I can leave you with anything:\n\n* Build around real pain points\n* Think longer than feels comfortable before committing\n* Only execute when the model is aligned and simple\n* You don’t need to understand everything upfront — learn step by step\n\nGood luck to everyone.",

Since you’re already a doctor, I’d strongly suggest leaning into that rather than trying random “make money online” stuff.\n\nYou could look into medical writing, telehealth platforms, health content reviewing, or even tutoring med students. Those usually pay way better than generic online jobs and actually value your background. I’ve also seen doctors make decent money creating exam prep notes, selling study guides, or freelancing for healthcare startups.\n\nTry platforms like Upwork or LinkedIn and search specifically for medical-related roles instead of broad remote jobs. It might take a little time to land the first one, but once you do, it gets much easier.\n\nAlso please be careful with anything that sounds like “easy money” or requires upfront payment. Stick to things where your expertise is the selling point.\n\nYou’ve already done the hard part by becoming a doctor, now it’s just about positioning that skill online. Don’t undersell yourself.

Just slow compounding of listeners who find my stuff through search or algorithm.\n\n$100 per month is not quit your job money but it's real and it's growing. At this rate I'll hit $200 per month sometime next year probably.\n\nThe people claiming you can make thousands per month passively within months are either lying or had some lucky break.

After I accepted the offer, the HR manager told me that they use a Time Doctor to track the activity.\n\nNormally, I take full responsibility for honestly working all 8 hours, and I have previously experienced micromanagement with excessive control from a toxic manager. Because of that, being tracked with a software seems not so bad for me.\n\nThe issue is that I will be working in regulatory affairs, which involves a lot of research, reading, and reviewing documents. I understand that there is an idle time, and for example, if you are actively reading and thinking for 3–5 minutes, Time Doctor may consider that idle time. It also seems that you cannot use the bathroom or take a short break between tasks to think, because it generates idle time.\n\nI would like to hear about the experiences of other remote workers who use Time Doctor. Do you have problems with idle time due to research or reading tasks?\n\nSome of you might say that I should have refused a job that uses a time tracker, as it could be a red flag that the company does not trust its employees. But to be honest, the job market is insane. It took me 4 months to find this job, and I feel I have nothing to lose. If I am not satisfied with the workplace, I will simply continue searching for another job.\n\nThank you in advance.",

Overall expect each time you get paid to spend around 5 minutes exchanging to your local currency and withdrawing to your bank, then 0.25% exchange fee + £1.95 withdrawal fee. \n\nBit of a pain in the arse for you but it allows a company like this to pay worldwide and offer work to freelancers in countries they might not have otherwise been able to with traditional banking systems.",

A couple of others that I have not made it passed the initial part yet / they do not seem as big of companies, as the 3 main ones are... Casting Words &amp; Transcription Hub. I have done a bit of research, and it looks like between the 3.. Allegis pays the highest, then eScribers, then Transcribeme. Transcribeme, is strictly download the files read them and learn on your own. Once you make it past the legal tests, there is a group you can ask questions to. eScribers, once you get to the interview and decide you want to give it a try, they give you a mentor. There is actually a lot more technical pieces to eScribers than Transcibeme from what I see so far, but I enjoy it more.\n\nI have read that with Allegis, if you are offered the phone interview you are basically in, just like eScribers, however someone else mentioned above that was not the case for them so maybe that is incorrect. I have read that you have to commit to a min. of 20 hours per week as well. Again, not confirmed just what I read. I am not sure if you have tried any of the other transcription places, but if you have not, I would definitely recommend attempting Transcribme's legal tests. Just try passing them alone will give you a significant amount of knowledge that can help you with transcribing in general. The way that they have their system set up is definitely entry level friendly. Good Luck on your interview, I'm sure you will do great, but if you do not. Don't sweat try one of these other companies!",

      "selftext": "Hi! Is clickworker legit? i’ve joined since last monday and at first it seemed odd but i did receive a small portion of money. apparently its some website that has 3 sets of campaigns and every set has a total amount of 30 so 90 in total and every campaign click gives me like a small commission. I also was added into a telegram group chat and i want to mention that those people are a bit.. odd? they talk like they’re bots but these are actually real people. now my issue is, today i did those set of campaigns again and apparently i won an exclusive campaign of an insane amount of money and to go further, i have to deposit 1.770€ to cover my insufficient balance to receive the 4.120€ that i won and now i am very skeptical because its an insane amount of money that i can’t deposit at the moment + i don’t really have a guaranteed that i will earn that amount back however i did inform myself further and everyone does say that Clickworker is legit and not a scam but i don’t know what to believe anymore. I am asking on multiple social medias at the moment to know other people’s experiences abt that website",

      "selftext": "Started this site last May. Writing about personal finance stuff, mostly credit cards and budgeting apps. Figured people searching for \"Card A vs Card B\" are probably ready to apply.\n\nFirst five months were dead. Like maybe 150 visitors total by September. I was writing twice a week, following all the SEO advice, but nothing was happening. Started thinking I picked the wrong niche.\n\nOctober things started moving. Traffic went from nothing to around 500 visitors a day. I was checking Google Analytics constantly. November hit 780. By December I was at 950 daily visitors and made $2,100 that month. I remember sitting at my desk just staring at the dashboard because I couldn't believe it was real.\n\nJanuary I made $2,800. Traffic was still around 950 a day, maybe 1,000 on good days. Thought okay this is it, it's going to keep growing.\n\nNow it's February and I'm still at 950 visitors. Revenue is around $2,600 this month so far. It's just stuck there. Traffic isn't growing at all.\n\nI've got 61 posts published. Still doing two per week like I have been. But new posts aren't ranking. My best post is a credit card comparison that ranks number 3 and makes about $740 a month by itself. I've written four more comparison posts trying to copy that success. None of them rank past page 2.\n\nThe posts that already rank are fine. They're not moving up but they're not dropping either. It's like I hit my ceiling.\n\nI started adding comparison tables in January. Like actual side by side breakdowns of fees and rewards. Takes longer to build but I thought it would help. Haven't seen any ranking changes yet. Maybe it's too soon, I don't know.\n\nGot an email list too. Around 620 people now. Growing maybe 25 a week. When I email about a new post I usually get a few signups. Email probably drives 10 or 15 percent of revenue but it's hard to track because people click through and apply later.\n\nConversion rate is around 1.4% which seems okay for finance. Most signups come from the comparison posts where I break down which card is better for specific situations. Takes way longer to write but people seem to trust it more.\n\nTried making some explainer videos in December. Used Canva for graphics and messed around with APOB and a couple other tools to make talking head style videos without showing my face. Made like three videos explaining credit card rewards programs. Got maybe 200 views total on YouTube. Took forever to put together so I gave up on that pretty quick.\n\nTried guest posting in January. Reached out to maybe 30 finance blogs. Got two guest posts published. Saw zero change in rankings.\n\nAlso tried Facebook ads for like two weeks in November. Spent around $240 targeting people interested in credit cards. Got maybe 160 clicks and literally zero applications. Not even one. Thought my tracking was broken but nope, just zero conversions. Stopped that immediately.\n\nTried Twitter too. Posted tips and linked to my posts for like three weeks. Got maybe 80 followers and like 20 clicks total. Waste of time.\n\nI post on Reddit sometimes in personal finance subs when I can actually help without being promotional. Drives maybe 100 visitors a month but most of them bounce anyway.\n\nUsing Ahrefs for keywords. $99 a month which sucks.\n\nWhat's frustrating is I don't know what changed. Traffic was growing every month from October to December. Then it stopped. I'm doing the same stuff. Same quality, same keywords, same everything.\n\nAlso seeing bigger sites like NerdWallet and The Points Guy covering the same cards I write about. They have way more authority so I'm probably screwed competing with them. Trying to find more specific angles like \"best credit cards for small business owners under 30\" but those get barely any searches.\n\nSpending maybe 18 hours a week on this. Writing takes forever when you have to research all the terms and conditions.\n\nTraffic is flat. Revenue is basically flat. New posts aren't ranking.\n\nDid Google change something in December or January? I keep seeing people talk about algorithm updates but I can't tell if I got hit.\n\nAnyone else stuck like this? I keep going back and forth on whether I should just keep doing what I'm doing or try something completely different. But I don't even know what different would look like. Like should I stop writing new posts and just update the ones that already rank? Should I try to get more backlinks even though guest posting didn't work? Should I just wait it out?\n\nI don't know. Some days I think I just need to be patient. Other days I think I'm wasting my time.",

Content pillars around credit itself, the factors in it, how to build credit, what is a good mix of credit cards, etc. might help. \n\nI think if Google looks at your site and thinks you’re only producing content to earn commissions, you’ll be pushed less.

      "selftext": "\n\nBeen looking at a lot of deal flow over the past 6-8 months and theres a pattern I keep noticing that I think is worth talking about. Not every type of online business is trending the same direction valuation-wise. Some categories are compressing, some are flat, and a few are quietly getting more expensive to acquire. I wanted to break down the three I keep seeing come up.\n\n\n\nFirst one is vertical SaaS for non-tech industries. Think software built for plumbers, dentists, property managers, small logistics companies. These industries are digitizing but they're doing it slowly and with very few options. Which means when someone builds a tool that actually works for, say, a regional plumbing company to manage scheduling and invoicing... that customer is not leaving. Ever. They're not browsing G2 on weekends looking for alternatives. They found something, it works, their admin person learned it, and thats that.\n\n\n\nI've seen vertical SaaS tools with pretty modest MRR, like $15-30k range, get competing offers because acquirers understand that the switching costs are massive and the TAM is still expanding. These industries haven't even scratched the surface of software adoption. Monthly churn on some of these is sub-2%, sometimes closer to 1.1-1.4%. Multiples are creeping up because buyers are pricing in the retention and the runway, not just current revenue.\n\n\n\nSecond category is one I find genuinely interesting. Productized services that are converting into software. So imagine a company that started doing manual SEO audits as a done-for-you service. Charging $500-800 per audit, doing maybe 40-60 a month. Then they build a tool that automates like 80% of the audit process. Now they've got proven demand (people already pay for this), improving margins because delivery is getting cheaper, and a path toward full SaaS economics.\n\n\n\nThese are fascinating from a buyer perspective because you're not guessing whether people want the thing. You already know they do. You're just watching the margin structure improve over time. I looked at one of these last year where gross margins went from 41% to 68% over 14 months just from automating parts of their fulfillment. The revenue barely changed but the business got dramatically more valuable.\n\n\n\nThird is micro-SaaS with integration or API plays. Small tools that plug into bigger ecosystems... Shopify apps, Salesforce integrations, Slack bots, tools that are Zapier-native. The thing about these is distribution is partially solved by the platform itself. You're not spending $4k/month on paid acquisition hoping your landing page converts. People find you in the app store while they're already looking for a solution.\n\n\n\nAnd once your tool is embedded in someone's workflow, the stickiness is insane. I looked at a Shopify app doing $22k MRR that had net revenue retention of like 113% because existing users kept upgrading as their stores grew. The app just grew with them. Churn was there but expansion revenue more than covered it.\n\n\n\nWhat I think is actually driving all three of these trends is the same underlying thing. Buyers are getting smarter about what \"defensible\" actually means. It's not about having a patent or some proprietary algorithm. It's about structural switching costs, embedded workflows, and expanding TAMs in categories where competition is still thin. Those three things together are what's making acquirers pay up.\n\n\n\nIf you're building in one of these categories and wondering whether the market values what you're doing... it probably does more than you think. And if you're not in one of these categories, I'm not saying your business isn't valuable, but it might be worth thinking about whether theres a way to move toward one of these dynamics. The margin structure one especially. I keep seeing sellers underestimate how much a clear trajectory matters to buyers even when the current numbers are mid.\n\n\n\nAnyway just patterns I've been noticing. Could be wrong about where things go from here but the deal data over the last year or so has been pretty consistent on this stuff.",

Basic affiliate setup linking to Photoshop alternatives and scanning equipment.\n\nFirst three months nothing happened. Maybe 200 visitors total. Spent the first month targeting stuff like \"best photo editing software\" and ranking on page 7 behind every tech blog that's ever existed. Gave up on that pretty quick.\n\nAround November I started writing these posts about specific types of damage. Like \"how to restore photos with mold damage\" or \"fix photos stuck to glass frames.\" More specific, less competition. Traffic started coming in. Hit about 1,100 visitors a day by December.\n\nThen something strange happened in January.\n\nI wrote this post about restoring Victorian era photographs because I had some examples from my girlfriend's grandmother's attic. Included a bunch of photos from the 1880s and 1890s. Put the names in the image alt text because I thought that's what you're supposed to do for accessibility or whatever.\n\nPost ranked fine. Nothing special. Then I started noticing weird searches in Search Console.\n\nTook me almost a week to figure out what was happening. I kept seeing traffic for \"Margaret Whitmore 1887\" and \"James Whitmore obituary\" and \"Whitmore family tree.\" Thought maybe there was some historical figure I'd never heard of. Googled them. Nothing. Just random dead people whose photos I'd used as examples.\n\nPeople were googling their dead relatives and finding my post because I had used their names in the image descriptions.\n\nNow about 40% of my traffic is people searching for specific names of people who died between 1850 and 1920. I'm ranking for hundreds of dead people's names. Sometimes I'm position 2 or 3 above actual genealogy sites. My top keyword used to be \"remove scratches from photos.\" Now it's \"James Whitmore 1889 obituary.\" I don't even have an obituary on my site.\n\nTraffic is up to 2,800 visitors a day. But my conversion rate tanked. Went from 3.1% in December to 1.4% now. Because people aren't looking for photo restoration services, they're looking for information about their great great grandfather.\n\nRevenue is basically the same as December even though traffic doubled. Made $1,840 in December, made $1,920 in January. Affiliate clicks are down. Time on page is up from 2 minutes to almost 6 minutes but nobody's buying anything.\n\nI get emails now. Maybe 10-15 a week. People asking if I have more information about their relatives. Asking if I know where the photos came from. One person offered me $200 for a high resolution scan of a photo that was in my post. I didn't even own the photo, it was from my girlfriend's family.\n\nOne person asked if I could \"sense\" anything about their great grandmother because I had her photo on my site. Like if I could feel her presence or something. They weren't joking. Offered me $50 to \"connect\" with her. I'm a blogger, not a medium.\n\nMy girlfriend's mom found the post in January and called at 11pm. I could hear her through the phone from across the room. Something about disrespecting the dead and exploiting family history. These people died in 1883. I don't think they care about my blog. Took the photos down anyway. Traffic from those specific names dropped immediately.\n\nStarted testing this with other posts. Wrote about restoring Civil War era photos, used names from Union soldier records that are public domain. Same thing happened. Now I'm ranking for like 30 soldiers' names. Getting emails from people asking about their great great great grandfather who fought in Virginia.\n\nI have no information to give these people. I just used the photos as examples. But they keep emailing.\n\nTried monetizing this differently in February. Added a section to those posts saying \"looking for more information about your ancestor? Try [Ancestry.com](http://Ancestry.com)\" with an affiliate link. Conversion rate went up to 2.1%. Made $2,340 so far this month.\n\nBut the emails are getting more intense. Someone asked if I could help them find their grandfather's grave. Someone else asked if I had any letters or documents. One person accused me of stealing photos from their family and said they'd report me to I don't even know what. The internet police? The photos are from the Library of Congress.\n\nAll the photos I use now are public domain or from my girlfriend's family with permission. But people don't care. They see a photo of someone with their last name from 1890 and assume I have some connection to their family history.\n\nI'm spending maybe 6 hours a week just responding to emails telling people I don't have any additional information. Another 10 hours writing new posts. So I'm spending 16 hours a week total, making $2,300 a month. That's like $35 an hour before taxes. I could literally make more doing photo editing gigs on Fiverr and not deal with angry emails about dead people.\n\nAlso my girlfriend wants me to stop using any photos that could be traced to real people. Which I get. But that's literally the entire traffic source now. If I switch to generic stock photos or illustrations the traffic will die.\n\nTried writing posts about photo restoration without using specific names. Just \"Victorian era photo restoration techniques\" with example images labeled \"Unknown woman circa 1885.\" Those posts get maybe 50 visitors a month. Nobody searches for that.\n\nThe traffic only comes when I use real names of real dead people.\n\nI looked into this and apparently it's legal because they've been dead for over 100 years and everything's public domain. But legal doesn't mean it feels right. I'm basically using dead people for SEO.\n\nSome of the emails are actually nice though. People thanking me for preserving the photos. People saying they've been searching for images of their ancestor for years. One person said my post was the only photo they'd ever seen of their great grandmother. That made me feel less terrible about the whole thing.\n\nBut I can't scale this. I can't hire someone to respond to emails about dead people's family histories. I can't outsource writing posts about specific individuals because you need to actually research them to write anything meaningful.\n\nAnd I don't want to research them. I just wanted to write about photo restoration.\n\nTraffic is growing. I'm at 3,100 visitors a day now. Revenue is growing slowly. Yesterday I ranked number 1 for someone's name and got an email from their living grandson asking if I was related to them. No dude. I just have a photo of your dead grandpa on my blog.\n\nBut I'm stuck in this weird niche where I'm accidentally running a genealogy resource site when I was trying to run an affiliate site about photo editing software.\n\nI don't know if I should lean into this or try to pivot back to the original plan. Leaning in means more emails, more research, more dealing with people's emotional family stuff. Pivoting back means losing most of my traffic.\n\nAlso tried adding a FAQ to those posts saying \"I don't have additional information about individuals in these photos.\" Doesn't help. People email anyway.\n\nThe restoration work itself is easy. Photoshop for most of it. Tried making some before and after comparison videos with APOB for a few posts back in December but nobody watched them so I stopped. That's not really the problem anyway.\n\nThe problem is I built something I didn't mean to build and now I don't know what to do with it.\n\nAnyone else end up ranking for something completely random? Do you follow the traffic or just start over?",

Add a link to an email address that they can contact you at... but use an autoresponder for that email address.

      "selftext": "TL;DR: Two-thirds of Skimlinks programs have no click data. The median EPC is $0.14. Commission rate is the wrong thing to optimize - EPC is. Interactive report with full data in comments.\n\nI pulled every program on Skimlinks (\\~29k) and categorized against a clean set of verticals. Here's what stood out.\n\n**1. There are way more dead programs than you'd expect.**\n\nOf 28,844 programs listed, 19,191 (66.5%) have no click data - no EPC, no conversion rate, no basket size. They're in the directory, but there's no evidence clicks are converting.\n\nSome could be new listings or programs that are primarily active on other networks. But even if you're generous and assume a quarter of them are just new -that still means roughly half the catalog is dead weight. The actual pool of programs generating real earnings is far smaller than the directory makes it look.\n\n**2. Commission rate is the wrong way to pick programs. EPC is better (when you have it).**\n\nCommission rate is the vanity metric everyone chases. \"This program pays 12%!\" But it ignores basket size and conversion rate - the two things that actually determine what you earn per click.\n\nEPC (earnings per click) = commission rate × average basket size × conversion rate. It captures the full picture in one number.\n\nHere are the top 10 programs on the entire Skimlinks network by EPC:\n\n|Program|EPC|Commission|Avg Basket|CVR|What's driving it|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Akind DE|$15.41|12.4%|$361|34.5%|Monster CVR|\n|ZenBusiness|$12.40|37.1%|$227|14.7%|High commission × high CVR|\n|GuestReady|$9.25|5.0%|$633|29.2%|Huge basket × huge CVR|\n|RajaniMD|$9.10|15.9%|$184|31.2%|High commission × monster CVR|\n|Ivim Health|$7.94|21.4%|$524|7.1%|Big basket × high commission|\n|Misha and Puff|$7.35|20.0%|$300|12.3%|Premium pricing × solid CVR|\n|smava|$7.33|1.5%|$20,628|2.4%|$20k basket - commission is irrelevant|\n|Cloud Water Filters|$6.64|58.2%|$354|3.2%|Extreme commission|\n|WECREAT TECH|$6.19|8.0%|$1,168|6.6%|$1k+ basket does the work|\n|Beeksebergen|$4.85|6.6%|$684|10.8%|Holiday rental - big basket × solid CVR|\n\nNot one of these would rank near the top if you sorted by commission rate alone. smava pays 1.5% commission and earns $7.33 per click because the average order is $20,000. GuestReady pays 5% and earns $9.25 because people book $633 stays and convert at 29%.\n\nThere are really only two equations that produce high EPC:\n\n**Big basket × modest commission** \\- travel, accommodation, finance, high-ticket goods. You don't need a high commission when someone books a $1,700 hotel stay at 5%.\n\n**High commission × high CVR** \\- health, business, education. Smaller baskets but 10–30% conversion rates. Volume compensates.\n\nThe trap is picking programs with moderate everything. Decent commission, average basket, average CVR. That's where most programs live and it's where EPC goes to die.\n\n**3. These patterns hold across every vertical.**\n\nI classified all 9,323 programs with EPC data into 21 verticals (using cross-network data from CJ, Impact, FlexOffers, and Awin to fix Skimlinks' messy categorization). The same two paths show up at the category level:\n\n|Vertical|Programs|Avg EPC|Avg Basket|CVR|Commission|What's working|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Finance &amp; Insurance|58|$0.66|$1,277|5.0%|12.2%|Big basket|\n|Jewellery|136|$0.43|$383|3.5%|8.4%|Big basket|\n|Travel &amp; Accommodation|444|$0.40|$612|3.5%|6.4%|Big basket|\n|Health &amp; Wellness|646|$0.35|$100|5.4%|10.6%|High CVR|\n|Sports &amp; Outdoors|404|$0.34|$217|4.6%|6.6%|Balanced|\n|...|||||||\n|Software &amp; Technology|142|$0.22|$69|2.1%|31.6%|Nothing - CVR kills it|\n\n(6 of 21 verticals. Full breakdown in the interactive report.)\n\nFinance earns $0.66/click on a $1,277 basket at just 12.2% commission. Software has the highest commission rate of any vertical (31.6%) and the lowest EPC ($0.22) because almost nobody converts (2.1% CVR).\n\n**4. The EPC distribution is brutal.**\n\nOf the 9,356 programs with a measurable EPC:\n\n* 46% earn less than $0.10 per click\n* The median is $0.14\n* Only 5.7% break $1.00\n* Just 9 programs in the entire network exceed $5.00\n\nThe distribution is massively right-skewed. Most programs cluster between $0.01 and $0.25. If you're picking programs without checking EPC, you're almost certainly landing in that pile.\n\n**5. The one thing to take from this:**\n\nSort by EPC, not commission rate. If a network doesn't show you EPC, calculate it from basket size and conversion rate. If they don't show you those either, that's a red flag in itself.\n\nThe interactive report has the full vertical breakdown with reversal rates, the top 20 programs ranked by EPC, EPC distribution charts, and a commission-vs-EPC scatter plot; below.\n\nThis is one network. I'm building the same analysis across CJ, Impact, ShareASale, Rakuten, Awin, and others - a free directory that surfaces EPC, basket size, conversion rates, reversal rates, and commission structures across 50,000+ listings. More on that in comments.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the data or methodology.\n\n*Data: 28,844 programs on Skimlinks, 9,356 with non-zero EPC. Vertical classification used cross-network category matching against CJ, FlexOffers, Impact, Awin, and others, with Skimlinks categories and manual review as fallback. All 9,323 programs with EPC data classified across 21 verticals. EPC/basket/CVR averages use non-zero values only. Full methodology in the interactive report.*",

      "selftext": "A few years ago I was working as a service advisor at a big UK dealership group (Volkswagen/SEAT/Škoda/Audi). Anyone who’s worked in the motor trade knows the chaos. Phones ringing, customers waiting, technicians asking questions, managers chasing numbers.\n\nOne of my targets was selling service plans.  \nMost advisors sold around 6 a month.  \nThe good ones hit 10–12.\n\nI’d been teaching myself software development in my spare time, so I built a tiny program to help me send personalised service plan emails at scale. Nothing fancy, just something to save time and make sure no customer slipped through the cracks.\n\nMy service plan sales jumped to 45–60 a month.\n\nSame dealership. Same customers. Same targets.  \nJust better process.\n\nLater I moved into sales and saw the exact same problems:\n\nLeads not being nurtured\n\nTest drives not followed up\n\nRenewals forgotten\n\nUpsells inconsistent\n\nRetention basically non-existent\n\nSo I kept building.\n\nFast forward three years and that little tool has evolved into a full platform that automates all the follow-ups dealerships never have time for. Sales, service, MOTs, renewals, birthdays, everything.\n\nI’m not here to promote anything, I just wanted to share the journey because it still feels surreal that something I built to boost my own commission turned into a real product.\n\nIf anyone’s interested in the process, the tech, the dealership side, or the lessons learned, I’m happy to share.",

When you signal \"this might not be for you,\" their brain flips from evaluating to wanting.\n\n  \nWhen it works best: prospects who are comparison shopping or skeptical.

Also great with higher-ticket deals where the buyer expects to be sold hard.\n\n  \nWhen to skip it: early stage prospects who barely know what they need yet. If someone is still figuring out the problem, telling them they might not be a fit just gives them permission to leave. They need education first, not a challenge.\n\n  \nThe balance question is the right one to ask. What worked for me was being specific about WHY they might not be a fit, not just vaguely saying \"we're not for everyone.\" Like \"honestly, if your team isn't ready to change their current workflow, this won't help you.\" That way you're filtering for real fit, not just playing a psychology trick.

In my experience, signaling that you’re open to walking away actually builds trust with prospects because it shows you’re genuinely interested in helping, not just making a sale. But it’s definitely not a one size fits all tactic. I usually lean into anti selling when I sense the other party is skeptical or feels pressured. If someone seems unsure or defensive, being upfront about whether you’re not sure it’s the right fit often gets them to open up more and be honest about what they need. But for super excited leads, being too quick to walk away can sometimes stall momentum, so I stick to classic qualifying questions there.\n\nBalancing honesty versus coming off negative is tricky, but I think it comes down to framing. Instead of saying, \"You’re probably not a fit,\" I stick to, \"Here’s where we tend to help best, do you think that matches up with your team?\" That way, it’s a conversation rather than a rejection.\n\nOn a related note, I’ve been working on an AI agent platform that basically automates a lot of these early conversations with prospects using hyper personalized outreach, but it still keeps things authentic and matches for fit. We’re opening an early users waitlist at [https://salespire.io](https://salespire.io) if you’re interested in trying it out or giving feedback.

I tracked every call this month and the data tells a clear story.\n\nOut of 820 dials, I got 124 connects which is about 16 percent connect rate. Of those connects, 32 turned into real conversations over 3 minutes. And 12 of those became booked meetings.\n\nThe math breaks down to roughly 72 calls per meeting. Not amazing, but profitable when your deal size is right.\n\nHere's what I learned about openers this month. I tested three different approaches across roughly equal call volumes. The pattern interrupt opener where I said something unexpected like \"Hey this is a cold call, you can hang up but give me 18 seconds first\" got 30 percent to stay on the line past 30 seconds. The permission-based opener where I asked \"Did I catch you at a bad time\" got 22 percent. The direct pitch where I immediately explained why I was calling got only 14 percent.\n\nThe pattern interrupt felt awkward at first but the data was clear. People appreciate honesty about what's happening.\n\nOn timing, I found that Tuesday through Thursday between 10 AM and 11:30 AM had the highest connect rates at 19 percent. Monday mornings were brutal at 9 percent. Friday afternoons were dead at 5 percent. I stopped calling Fridays after lunch entirely.\n\nThe biggest insight was about follow-up after missed calls. I left 310 voicemails. Got 7 callbacks. That's barely 1 percent. But when I stopped leaving voicemails and instead sent a quick LinkedIn message within 5 minutes of the missed call, I got 22 responses from 156 attempts. That's 14 percent. The multi-touch approach crushed voicemail-only.\n\nMy current approach is to call, if no answer send immediate LinkedIn connection with a note referencing the call, then follow up with email the next day. This three-channel approach within 24 hours gets way better results than any single channel alone.\n\nThe psychology behind why this works is simple. People are busy. They miss calls all the time. But when they see the same person tried to reach them through multiple channels, it signals importance. It also creates familiarity. By the time they see your email, they've already seen your name twice.\n\nThe reps on my team who adopted this approach saw their meeting rates increase by 37 percent within the first month. The ones who stuck to single-channel calling stayed flat.\n\nCold calling works but it's not about the call anymore. It's about how the call fits into a larger sequence. The phone is the start of the conversation, not the whole thing.\n\nIf you're still measuring success by calls made, you're missing the point. Measure conversations started across all channels. That's what actually predicts revenue.",

But even now, cold calls arent highly effective (as tracked close rate percentages always demonstrate) and they will never not be abrasive. I think they key to using calls to generate business requires a clever and effective sales/marketing hybrid approach that qualifies leads and generates consultative, warm-calls. The more of these your firm generates, the more calls your sales team can make. More criticaly, instead of knowing nothing about them, salespeople can act as a guide (and a catalyst) towards finding solutions your firm offers that help with your prospect's challenges. \n\nThe corporate avg is typically stated that around 5% of cold calls generate revenue (or so my last couple employers used to state) Thus, old school mentality was to get your sales to call, call, call!! To me, that just meant 95% of my time (and later, my team's time) was inefficiently spent. Later, as VP of Sales, I arranged to regularly collaborate with marketing and product to ensure our solutions were getting in front of the right eyes, the product regularly evolved to meet or exceed expectations and our sales team was then getting warm leads to follow up as helpful consultants and not high-pressure closers. Getting the process to a place where it became truly effective took time (about 6mo) with much back and forth. Along the way we discovered roadblocks in all areas, marketing, sales and product which we then tweaked and refined. Ultimately we grew flat sales to +35% (Year 1) and +45% (year 2). \n\nCold calling is a blunt-force approach and DOES have its place in the very early days but, this should rather quickly be evolved around a more strategic business plan to capture new customers and revenue. \n\n",

Most of these companies are run by skilled tradespeople who are great at the work but terrible at consistent follow-up. The ones who figure out predictable lead flow scale fast because the bottleneck is almost never the service quality, it's the pipeline.\n\nCurious about your tech stack for this. Are you running SMS campaigns through something like Twilio or using a platform, and are you building the automation yourself or using off-the-shelf tools? The margin difference between those two approaches is massive at scale.\n\nAlso, one thing I've seen work well for local service lead gen: once you nail the playbook for one vertical (say pressure washing), the same system usually transfers to adjacent verticals with minimal tweaking. Landscaping, HVAC, roofing. The outreach mechanics are nearly identical, just different keywords and seasonal patterns. That's where the real compounding happens.",

You’ve conquered the hardest part: the Internal Validation.\n\nHowever, coming from my book 'Startup Inferno,' I must give you a word of caution as you scale. You are currently in the stage of 'The Hero’s Grit.' You generated $127k through pure willpower. But as you look to grow, you need to move from being the 'Motor' to being the 'Architect.'\n\nUsing the Curling analogy: right now, you are throwing the stone and sweeping the ice with everything you have. To reach the next level, you need to build a Structure (systems and lead-gen flows) that works even when you take a breath. You’ve proven you can survive; now it’s time to prove you can build a legacy that doesn't depend solely on your daily adrenaline.\n\nKeep building with that same 'stubborn hope.' The world needs more founders who have real scars.\n\nNow that you’ve mastered the 'hustle,' what is the first system you are building to ensure this business remains a source of freedom rather than a new type of cage?",

You may get some quick wins, but don't be lulled into thinking that's every day. \n2. Surround yourself with people smarter than yourself.  It's the smartest thing you can do. \n3. Practice self-care. Entrepreneurship requires every bit of you. Every single day. (And most nights.) Exercise. Eat well. Meditate. Rest. The basics. But you have to do them better, than most other people, just to keep moving forward. Do not underestimate this. \n\nP.S. I did spend a few years working for other companies. But they simply taught me what I did not want to do. \n\nWhat would you add to this list?\n\n \n\n ",

      "selftext": "So I wasted like 3.5 years trying every productivity system. Bought some $150 Notion template from a YouTuber (embarrassing). Did the whole Todoist thing, Obsidian, bullet journals, all of it.\n\nBasically I wasn't actually working. Just organizing my work and feeling productive about organizing. Being busy doesnt equal getting important shit done.\n\nEvery morning id open whatever app and see like 40+ tasks, spend 20 minutes moving shit around and color coding it. Then do one easy task and call it a day. The actual important stuff? Always \"tomorrow\"\n\nI had 40 tasks every day. Would finish maybe 1. The other 39 just sitting there judging me. Way too many to even know where to start so I'd just pick whatever seemed easiest.\n\nThe list was the whole problem.\n\nSo i said fuck it and deleted everything, every app, every so called productivity tool. Bought a small whiteboard from around the corner.\n\nMade one rule: only what fits on here matters today. That's it.\n\nWrote 3 tasks. Not 40. Just the 3 actual important things I need to do to get closer to my goals. Things that can actually be done in a workday.\n\nWith only a few realistic tasks, you can't hide anymore. With 40 tasks theres always an excuse like \"oh ill do that big one after i knock out these 5 quick things\" but with 3? You either do them or you dont and you know it.\n\nWhen I finished something I'd get up, walk over, cross it off with this red marker. It stayed there all day with the line through it. Could actually see what i did. Which gives me some validation that I am moving forward.\n\nThis worked amazing! No anxiety, no busyness. Just getting shit done.\n\nMy buddy came over and just started reading my tasks out loud. \"Yo whats this project about?\" Just reading my whole board.\n\nSame thing on video calls, people asked about the whiteboard behind me, trying to read it.\n\nAnd I work from home so its in my living space. In the evening trying to get a clear head and my tasks are right there staring at me.\n\nBut i couldn't hide it because seeing it was the entire point. That was the whole system.\n\nSo I got this idea, what if it just flips. One side is the whiteboard for tasks. Other side is just clean wood that actually looks good on a wall without office vibes. No art needed, just nice &amp; clean looking surface.\n\nTook me forever to figure out how to make it light enough to actually flip easily and stick with magnetic fixation. Tried a bunch of materials that were either too heavy or looked like crap. Went through like 10 different prototypes. Tested several concepts, some worked great but i just didnt like them aesthetically so i moved on until something clicked.\n\nReal lesson tho is 3 tasks you actually finish beats 40 tasks you organize and never do. Less isnt limiting its just focus. Being busy doesnt always equals getting shit done.\n\nObviously this is the polished version. There were a LOT of ups and downs in between.",

Something about writing by hand and physically crossing things off hits different than checking a box in an app. I think its because digital tools are too forgiving. You can drag, snooze, reschedule, archive. A whiteboard just stares at you.\n\n  \nThe privacy problem you ran into is interesting too and honestly a good sign.

Spending more time organizing applications than actually applying. Notion boards with 50 tracked jobs, all color coded. But only 2-3 apps a day.\n\nWhat actually worked:\n\n1. Max 5 applications per day but make them count. Customize each one.\n\n2. Use tools that remove the busywork.

I'd dump my ideas into the journal, rank them by importance, then recall them using auto fill (app would keep record of 7 days of blurbs).

If they're cobbling together spreadsheets, emailing themselves reminders, or paying for some clunky workaround, that's real signal. If they just nod and say \"yeah that sounds cool,\" that's politeness, not validation.\n\nThe other expensive lesson I learned: the MVP doesn't need to be software. We've shipped validation tests with landing pages, manual processes behind the scenes, and even just a well-written email describing the solution. If people won't engage with a rough version, they definitely won't engage with a polished one. Glad you came out the other side with something profitable. That second run is always sharper.",

          "body": "I am starting my journey too \n\nI wasn’t always confident.\n I’ve been shy for most of my life. I turned 18 last December, and the person I am today is the result of a series of experiences that shaped how I think, work, and make decisions.\nAs a child, I was mischievous. My parents worried about where that energy would take me, so they sent me to a hostel for my development. That decision changed my life. Living away from home at a young age forced me to learn how to survive on my own, how to socialize, and how systems work when you’re not protected by comfort.\nThe hostel environment exposed me to power dynamics early. Bullying existed. Seniors used power for entertainment. We were forced into situations where we had to fight our own friends or do things just to avoid being targeted. It showed me how fragile people can be under pressure, and how easily power can be misused. Those years taught me how authority works in the real world and what kind of authority I never want to become.\nI stayed in the hostel from Class 3 to Class 5. When I returned home in Class 6, I realized I didn’t think like most people my age. My thinking patterns were different. My maturity didn’t match my age group. That gap stayed with me.\nThen the pandemic hit, and with it came one of the hardest phases of my life. I lost my grandmother without being there to see her for the last time. I had the option to go, but I chose differently. That decision left me with guilt I still carry. The weight of that period pushed me into isolation. I escaped into online games and distractions, trying not to sit with what I was feeling.\nAfter lockdown, I joined another hostel for a new school. This time, I was the senior. The difference was simple. I did not repeat what was done to me. I chose not to use power the way I had experienced it. I focused on helping juniors in studies, decision making, and personal growth. That was the first time I consciously decided the kind of leader I wanted to become.\nThat phase is where my self development started seriously. I began exercising. I started reading. The first book I picked up was Atomic Habits, and it changed how I approached my life. I went from nearly failing to becoming a top three student. By Class 10, I had read extensively on psychology, communication, and business. I was actively working on my mindset, discipline, and character.\nClass 10 was also when I discovered entrepreneurship properly. Before that, I thought entrepreneurship only meant building big companies. Watching Iman Ghazi’s self development content became a turning point. In hostel, we only had phone access twice a week. I used that time to study his content and spent the rest of the week applying what I learned. I could see real changes in how I thought and acted. Later, I learned he was running a business. That is when I realized building something of your own was not just about companies. It was about ownership over your life.\nAfter Class 10, I returned home for Classes 11 and 12. That phase was unstable. Poor choices and lack of discipline led to wasted time. I went from being a top three student to losing consistency. My boards are now just days away. I do not feel fully prepared, but I will get through them.\nWhat has not changed is clarity about my potential. After my boards, I am moving out. Not for college, but to build. I have saved enough to support myself for one year. That one year is fully dedicated to starting my own venture. This is not impulsive. I have been thinking about this path for years. It is a new beginning, and while there is fear, there is also certainty about what needs to be done.\nI am not chasing money for the sake of it. I have been clear about my field for around four years now. I am serious about the work. I do not come from privilege. I come from a lower middle class family. My father’s job is enough to sustain a living. Nothing more, nothing less. I do not have a safety net of cafes, luxury setups, or lifestyle content before success. I have discipline, clarity, and the willingness to build from zero.\nCollege and a job are common paths. They are not the only ones. I am choosing to try building something of my own. This is my bet on myself.",

Talking to people early feels uncomfortable, but it saves you from months of false confidence. Your point about prioritizing sales and feedback over perfection is spot on. A rough product with real users teaches you more in weeks than a polished one sitting unused.\n\nAppreciate you sharing this honestly.

The comparison trap is real.\n\n  \nSomething that helped me: most of those 10k MRR posts leave out the 2 years of nothing before that. Or the fact that they had savings, a co-founder, prior audience, whatever. You are seeing highlight reels and comparing them to your behind-the-scenes footage.\n\n  \nA few things that helped me stay sane early on:\n\n  \n1. I stopped tracking what other people were doing and started tracking only my own weekly progress. Even small stuff like talked to 3 potential users or shipped that one feature counts. When you look back after a month you realize you actually moved a lot.\n\n  \n2. The loneliness part is real. Find even one other person building something. Not a mastermind group or a paid community, just one person you can text this sucks today or I just got my first user. That changes everything.\n\n  \n3. The am I cut out for this feeling never fully goes away. It just gets quieter as you get more reps in.

They got there by closing the app and doing one uncomfortable thing per day. One cold email, one user interview, one feature shipped.\n\nAlso worth remembering that \"first few paying users\" is genuinely the hardest milestone in any business. Going from 0 to 1 is harder than going from 100 to 1000.

      "selftext": "We're a small software dev shop (4 people, veteran-owned SDVOSB) that builds custom software for government and enterprise clients. We've closed over $1M in contracts in roughly 2 years. The average deal is around $100K, and the lifetime client value sits around $350K as they re-up.\n\nHere's the thing: almost all of that came from me and my network. Every time we've tried to bring on a salaried salesperson, it's been the same story. Pay them for months, they don't close anything, and we're out a chunk of cash we could've reinvested into the business. It's happened multiple times now, and honestly, it's one of the most frustrating parts of scaling.\n\nSo we shifted our thinking. We put together what I think is a solid commission structure:\n\n* 10% on the initial downpayment\n* 5% on all recurring revenue from their clients\n* 30% of anything sold above our base proposal (so if we quote $100K and they close at $130K, they keep 30% of that $30K)\n\nWe'd also cover conference tickets and events since that's a big part of how deals happen in this space.\n\nOn a typical deal, that's around $10K upfront with recurring income over the client's lifetime. Not bad for someone who knows how to sell and doesn't need their hand held.\n\nBut I genuinely cannot figure out where to find people who are actually good at sales AND willing to work commission. Every platform I've tried is either flooded with people who want a base salary no matter what, or with people who talk a big game but don't deliver.\n\nFor those of you who've been in a similar spot, where did you actually find your salespeople? Did commission only work for you, or did you just bite the bullet and keep paying salaries until someone stuck? Also open to hearing if my comp structure is off, always willing to adjust.\n\nAppreciate any insight. This is the one piece of the puzzle I haven't figured out yet.",

          "body": "We're a similar size dev shop and went through the exact same cycle. Hired two salespeople over a year and a half, neither closed a single deal. The problem is that selling custom software is fundamentally different from selling a product. Your prospects need someone who can talk architecture, understand scope, and build trust around technical competence. A traditional salesperson can't do that.\n\nWhat worked for us was treating sales as a partnership function, not a hire. We found two channel partners (an agency and a consulting firm) who already had relationships with the types of clients we serve. They bring us into conversations when a client needs custom dev work, and we give them a referral cut. No salary risk, no ramp-up time, and the leads come pre-qualified because the partner already has trust.\n\nYour commission structure looks reasonable, but I'd add one thing: make sure whoever you bring on has genuine technical literacy. They don't need to code, but they need to understand enough to have a credible conversation about what you build and why it matters. That's the filter most dev shops miss.",

Off the back of the workshop the client receives detailed documents of what they want to build. It’s a recommended architecture, feature and design doc. They see what they get in their MVP and their roadmap. You would essentially do a version of this when they sign up anyway but by doing it as a separate product there’s a low cost and low friction step that provides real value. Technically they can shop the doc to get quotes on the build but no one ever did because the relationship is built and they’re already in motion (especially now days when you have a tool like Figma make that can punch out a prototype in a few minutes and include mock UIs in the workshop doc 🤯). For sales people their close rate went up exponentially because they weren’t selling $100k build which will normally need several people to sign off on instead they were selling a $5-$10k workshop which usually only needs one person to sign off on.

          "body": "The reason you keep losing money on salaried salespeople is that government/enterprise software sales has a long cycle and a very specific skillset. Most salespeople who apply to small shops are used to selling something with a shorter close and an established brand behind them. They flounder when they have to open doors from scratch in a niche like SDVOSB contracting.\n\n  \nYour commission structure is actually solid for someone who understands the space. The problem is where you are looking. A few things that have worked for other small shops in similar positions:\n\n  \n1. Look for retired or semi-retired government contracting officers or program managers. These people have the rolodex and understand procurement, but they are done with full-time work. Commission-only or part-time with commission is perfect for them. Try AFCEA chapter events, local GovCon meetups, and LinkedIn groups specifically for SDVOSB/8a contractors.\n\n  \n2. Partner with other small SDVOSB shops that do complementary work (cybersecurity, cloud infra, data analytics). You refer them your overflow, they refer you theirs. No salesperson needed for those deals, just relationship management.\n\n  \n3. If you want a dedicated seller, consider a hybrid: small base (even $2-3K/month) plus your commission structure. The base signals that you are serious and filters out the dreamers. The good ones will earn way more from commission anyway. $2-3K/month is cheap insurance against another wasted hire.\n\n  \n4. Your $100K average deal with $350K LTV is a strong story. Lead with that when recruiting. A salesperson closing even 3 deals a year at your structure would earn $30K+ in commissions plus recurring. Make sure your pitch to salespeople is as polished as your pitch to clients.\n\n  \nThe uncomfortable truth is that pure commission-only is a red flag for top sales talent because they have options. The people willing to work 100% commission with no base tend to be either very confident or very desperate, and the ratio skews toward the latter.",

The good ones already have established books of business and are not browsing job boards.\n\nWhat has worked for similar shops I know: instead of hiring salespeople, they turned their existing team into a sales channel. Engineers writing about their work, speaking at conferences, being active in communities where government procurement people and CTOs hang out. Slower but the close rate is dramatically higher because the buyer is talking to the person who will actually build their system.\n\nThe SDVOSB advantage is also worth leaning into harder. There are procurement officers who actively need to fill set-aside quotas. Building direct relationships with those specific people is often more productive than any cold outreach campaign.",

Let them go after 3 months and $15k in lost salary payments and had a serious think about why it didn’t work. Here’s my thoughts.\n\n1. I was expecting a sales person to build out sales infrastructure when they were expecting just to close deals. We didn’t have a big enough pipeline to have a sales person so the bulk of their work would have been just building that and that wasn’t their skill.\n\n2. I didn’t have a clear enough offer / product. Well this one is a bit challenging because I do, and we are bringing in close to 1M each year in business so it’s obviously working. But we don’t run ads / have a fixed price list / etc etc so it was difficult for the sales person to articulate.\n\n3. They didn’t know very much about the service that we offered and so couldn’t really understand the need for it. That made them fail when it came to explaining basic concepts.\n\nEven at 1M a year we’re not big enough for that. I’m closing business now and doing a good job. We’re working on building out the pipeline infrastructure and are not looking for sales at the moment at all.",

Customers like \"experts\" far better than a vaporwave person.  How to do this easily?  Take one of your staffers along with you on a sales call.  Let them see how it works.  Then have them answer some of the customer's questions, and let the staff member \"snow\" the customer with technical jargon, as that is GOOD thing.  The staff member just PROVED to the customer they are technical, not good at talking with normal people, and literally will have a valuable opinion of the do-ability of the task, and even define the stages and algorithms needed to solve the task. \n\nThus,  the customer now knows your firm has experts who are well qualified to COMPLETE the job, instead of getting just half way, taking half the budget, before telling the customer, the job can not be done.\n\nHope this helps.",

It provides questionable results, it is risky, it takes forever, it is never the primary solution for any given problem but often the most expensive one and if you fail, it can seriously damage the decision makers career. \n\n\"But I want to offer custom dev\"\nYes. It is absolutely possible to do so.\nBut you need to separate FULFILMENT from your VALUE PROPOSITION.\n\nSee, your customers will buy the following offer:\n\"We help (industry) to achieve (transformation) in (time span), as proven by (case study A, case study B).\"\n\nE.g. \"We help medical device manufacturers cut time to market by 30% by introducing a custom PLM solution based on ... as end-to-end backbone in 3-6 months\"\n\nThat's an actual example of a biz doing very well. \nIt is still 80% custom development in the background. But the value proposition and the target audience is crystal clear.\n\nAnd abacadabra, sales and marketing suddenly do work.\nAnd it gets even easier to find new customers using partners and referrals. \n\nHow to shift from generic dev shop to such a business?

The job comes with a free apartment so I don’t have to worry about rent or utilities. However, I don’t really know what to do with my income. I save almost all of it and I feel like I’m just wasting potential. I’d like to start a business, but I don’t know what or where. Plus the job is so easy that I’m able to finish my entire work in less than three hours. I have so so much time that I could be putting towards an online business. There are so many scams on the Internet about get rich quick schemes and I’m not looking for that. There was a lady on Instagram that wanted me to pay her 5K for some sales tips BS. Thank God I didn’t do it.\n\nI don’t want to be in property management/real estate the rest of my life. It’s extremely boring and there’s no passion in it. In about two months I’m going to start aesthetician school and that will take me about seven months to complete. The goal is to be able to open up my own beauty salon one day. However, I’d like to start a business in e-commerce or something that I can work from home to get more passive income. I know that I am blessed to be in the position that I am however, I am incredibly bored with what I’m doing now.\n\nI keep seeing people online open up online businesses and they’re able to quit their 9 to 5 and travel all over the world. This has been a dream of mine.\n\nIf anyone has advice or tips for me, I would greatly appreciate it.",

Then work for for someone for at least 2 years\n\n\nI've spent time at the SBA ( specifically small businesses development association) and you would be surprised at how many businesses fail in under a year because they are undercapitalized or not familiar enough with business operations.\n\n\nMaybe 1/10  of these kind of people succeeded and the rest wiped out their life savings. Having an extra  50-100k would have helped them stay in business just long enough to maybe be successful. That + business knowledge pushes survival to 8/10 over 3 years IME. \n\n\nEdit: I also want to note that depending on the area (I'm assuming 714 is SoCal) rents can be insanely expensive for businesses. \n\n\nFor Esthianians, barbers, accountants, massage, etc... What I've often seen work is people working for someone else, building a client base, \"renting a booth\" (or the equivalent. For music producers it would be a studio space) and THEN starting their own business.\n\n\nThis is especially true for people in the beauty/physical realm, since the large amount of turnover means your meeting future potential employees/co-owners/lesees. \n\n\nThere's a few people I've met who after working in the industry for 5-10 yrs opened there own shop and within 2 years opened a second, because of how deep their rolladex of contacts was. ",

Almost everyone who comes to r/Entrepreneur to ask for advice is asking about something that has been discussed extensively. That's just the bell curve that is real life. Most problems are typical problems.\n\nIn your case, I think you should consider that **your current job is your passive income**. Because if you're saving 75%+ of your income, then you are already halfway there: you just went backwards. The trope of the successful entrepreneur is:\n\n1. Come up with working business idea  \n2. Have plenty of money with little effort\n\n[You did the opposite. ](https://i.makeagif.com/media/11-20-2017/_IufW-.gif) Step 2 is done, so now it's on to step 1.\n\nGetting your aesthetician license is a great idea, especially if you can stay full-time. It will be a great chance to learn about that business and see what you might want to do. Maybe it is the salon, like you said. Or maybe the supply business is interesting, since that involves travel to lots of different places to share your product. Or maybe you want to get into solely event work, like weddings, and you make a company for that. Or perhaps it is in a different field entirely.\n\nDon't do anything except learn--especially about stuff that seems boring. Accounting. Taxes. Employee law. Business plans. Hang out in forums like this one. \n\nCongrats! And good luck.",

Everything you need to learn is free on YouTube and Reddit.\n\n  \nStart with a service before a product. Pick something you can do with your existing skills (property management means you understand operations, tenant communication, vendor coordination). Offer that as a service to other property managers or small landlords. You already know the pain points. Services get you cash flow and customer conversations fast, which tells you what product to build later.\n\n  \nUse those extra hours to actually build, not to research endlessly. I spent months reading about business ideas before I realized the only way to learn was to pick one and start. Even if the first thing doesnt work you learn more in 2 weeks of doing than 6 months of planning.\n\n  \nAnd honestly with 9K coming in and no rent, you can save aggressively.

This is completely normal and it's actually a sign you need to make your next hire an operations person, not another revenue-generating role.\n\nWe went through the same transition. The instinct is to keep hiring people who do the core work, but what actually unlocks your time is hiring someone whose entire job is managing the people stuff. Scheduling, time off, shift coverage, onboarding. All of it.\n\nThe math is simple: if you're spending 15-20 hours a week on employee management instead of growth activities, an ops manager at 50-60K pays for themselves almost immediately through the revenue you can now generate with that recovered time.\n\nShort term fix while you hire: give your most reliable employee at each location scheduling authority. They handle swaps and coverage, you only get involved for exceptions. It won't solve everything but it buys you back a few hours a week.",

You are past the point where you can keep it all in your head but probably not big enough to justify a full time ops person. That middle zone is brutal.\n\n  \nTwo things that helped me get out of this exact loop:\n\n  \nFirst, I stopped being the single point of contact for scheduling changes. Picked one reliable person at each location and made them the shift swap coordinator. They handle the day to day shuffles and only escalate to me if there is a conflict nobody can resolve. That alone cut my scheduling time by probably 60 percent. People still get their swaps handled, they just go through someone who is already on the floor and knows the context better than I do.\n\n  \nSecond, I set hard boundaries on when time off requests get processed. Instead of handling them as they came in throughout the day, I batch them. Every Monday morning I review anything that came in the previous week, approve or flag conflicts, done. The constant interruptions were what made it feel like a full time job, not the actual decision making which usually takes five minutes per request.\n\n  \nAt 22 people you are not doing something wrong. This is just the stage where you either build a system or slowly become an unpaid office manager. The good news is once you push some of that responsibility down, it actually runs smoother because the people closest to the work make better scheduling calls than you do sitting in a different room.",

I firgured they needed accountability. So, I had them send daily 5 minute report of what they were working, what’s their focus for the day, and what were they stuck or off track. Plus I needed them to start organizing their shifts themselves.\n\nThe second thing was that I end up hiring a remote virtual assistant in Latam through a company that GPT recommended. This staffing agency was called Hire With Near. It was game changing. Yep it cost me a bit at first but it was totally worth it. Instead of spending 60-70k having someone on-site or remote in the US this VA from Mexico was around ~20k a year.  But beyond saving time an each week I had most of the admin stuff handled.

Put yourself around founders doing bigger numbers. Attend events. Join paid communities. Work with higher level clients. Travel while still running your business. You do not need a campus to expand your thinking. And those travel build programs can be interesting, but only if they genuinely raise your standards and connect you with serious operators.

You're doing neither. You already named your actual gap: no network beyond clients, no exposure beyond your niche, limited worldview. That's a more honest self-assessment than most people twice your age ever make.\n\nHere's what I'd sit with. The question isn't \"college or no college.\" It's \"what kind of growth do I need right now?\" You've proven you can execute. You can build, sell, deliver. That's real and you should be proud of it. But execution without perspective narrows over time. You get better and better at the thing you already know, and your world gets smaller while your revenue gets bigger. That's a trap disguised as progress.\n\nCollege, at its best, isn't about learning business theory. It's about being forced to think across disciplines you would never choose on your own. Philosophy, history, psychology, ethics. The stuff that doesn't feel useful until ten years later when you're making decisions that require more than tactical skill. It broadens the foundation you build everything else on.\n\nThat said, a traditional four-year degree isn't the only way to get that. Those travel programs you mentioned sound closer to what you actually need: real exposure, real building, real worldview expansion. The test for any option isn't \"will this give me a credential.\" It's \"will this make me think differently about what I'm already doing.\"\n\nYou don't need a backup plan. You need a wider lens. How you get it matters less than whether you're honest about needing it. And at 19, the fact that you already see that puts you ahead of where most people start",

And the mom of the lead singer girl made her go to college,  first, and then revisit her music career. They *never* got back to where they were before she dropped it to go to college. \n\nI think my point is, if you're building, and it is still in the early stages, see if you can get that degree now. And go for one that actually helps you with your business/niche. \nIf you've done a lot of building, and it has (starter to) really take off, don't just drop your business.  \n\nAnd there's lots of space between 'dropping the business and going 100% for the degree' and 'focusing 100% in your business and NOT getting a degree at all'.",

Same angle. Same cursor hovering over revenue. Same refresh button. Same captions about quitting your job.\n\nOne in particular kept popping up on my feed. Young guy, rented Airbnb background, MacBook on the table, showing what looked like steady five-figure days. I wasn’t even mad about it. I’ve been in dropshipping long enough to know big days happen.\n\nI probably wouldn’t have thought twice about it if I hadn’t paused the video at the wrong time.\n\nWhen he refreshed the dashboard, the numbers updated and for a split second there were two dollar signs in front of the revenue. Most likely a typo. One slightly offset. It disappeared almost immediately when the animation finished. You wouldn’t notice it unless you scrubbed through the video frame by frame.\n\nSo I did.\n\nI replayed it a few times and it kept happening. The extra symbol showed up for a fraction of a second and then corrected itself. It didn’t look like lag.\n\nInstead of commenting publicly, I DMed him. Acted interested. Asked about the course, the usual questions. He replied quickly, sent voice notes, told me spots were filling up, as every guru does i guess.\n\nAfter a few messages, I sent him a screenshot from his own reel with the duplicate dollar sign circled and just asked what that was.\n\nHe responded saying they had a collaboration with a platform that lets them simulate dashboards for marketing. Said it helps make content cleaner and even sent a signup link to the same platform he was FAKING it all on. Said the real business is separate from what’s shown in videos.\n\nJust so you understand the size of this problem - there's probs way more affiliates, way more gurus who are selling you courses that don't even know how to do the thing they're selling.\n\nI know how bad it sometimes feels when your sales are slow and then you see a 19 year old kid flexing lambos and multi-million revenue on Instagram. I'm asking you to stop believing it.\n\nNow whenever I see those “flexing” videos, I can't help myself but to analyse every single detail of the video lol.\n\nEDIT: My DM's are being flooded by people asking what the tool name is.

It’s the obsession with looking successful to trigger other people's FOMO, rather than building a business that actually generates cash. When a guru tells you that 'simulating dashboards helps make content cleaner,' they are admitting that their business isn't sales, it’s illusion.\n\nUsing my **Curling analogy**: these guys are trying to convince you that they’ve thrown a perfect stone by photoshop-ing the target. But in the real world, the ice is cold and the friction is real. If you don't have a **Structure** that handles real customer data, real logistics, and real margins, you don't have a startup; you have a video edit.\n\nReal entrepreneurs don't flaunt dashboards; they obsess over **Operational Validation**. They know that the only 'clean' content is a bank statement that matches the tax returns.\n\n**Quick question:** Beyond the technical glitches, what do you think is the biggest 'red flag' in the way these gurus talk about the actual operations of the business?",

Something boring that solves a real problem and people already pay for. Local lead gen, short form content for businesses, email marketing for small ecom brands, that kind of thing. You do not need capital for that, just skill and relentless outreach.\n\nEveryone wants leverage before they’ve earned it. Leverage comes after you can consistently sell. So step one would be learn how to sell. Cold outreach, follow ups, handling objections, closing on Zoom. It’s uncomfortable but that’s where the money is. You can make 3k to 5k per month way faster with a service than trying to build the next big SaaS from zero. I’ve seen people burn 12 months building something nobody asked for. Painful.\n\nThen once cash flow is stable, I’d build distribution. Newsletter, Twitter, maybe YouTube. Not for ego, but to own attention. Attention compounds. You post consistently for a year and suddenly doors open. Weird how that works. It’s boring at first. Feels like shouting into the void. But that’s the tax.\n\nSo yeah. Service for cash. Sales skill for survival. Distribution for leverage. Then product later when you actually understand the market.\n\nIf you’re into building real wealth from zero and not just dreaming about it, I write about that journey weekly in Wealth Rewired.

That's the actual leverage, using AI to amplify a service business, not trying to compete in the AI product space with zero runway.\n\n  \nBiggest mistake I see people make is skipping straight to \"build a SaaS\" when they have no income, no network, and no understanding of what people actually pay for. Service work teaches you all of that while keeping the lights on.",

Actually talking to 50 people who run small businesses or SaaS companies and asking \"what is the most painful repetitive thing you do every week?\"\n\nThe answer in 2026 almost certainly involves AI automation. But not the way most people think. It is not \"build another AI wrapper.\" It is \"find a 500 dollar per month manual process and automate 80 percent of it with existing AI tools.\" Sell that as a service before you build a product.\n\nBiggest advantage of starting from zero in 2026 vs 2020: the cost to build has dropped 10x. A SaaS that took 50k and 6 months can now ship for under 500 dollars in a few weeks. But that also means competition is brutal, so distribution matters more than ever.\n\nFastest path: skill leads to income leads to problem discovery leads to service leads to productize.

SOMEONE ELSE'S TWEET (1,900 likes)\n\n\n\nA random user tweeted about my product. I had nothing to do with it.\n\n\n\nMy tweets: 4 likes\n\nRandom user's tweet: 1,900 likes\n\n\n\nSame product. Different messenger.\n\n\n\nLesson: You can't make your product go viral. But you can make a product so good that others want to share it.\n\n\n\n2. GERMAN TECH BLOG (3,500 downloads)\n\n\n\nA respected German tech blog found my product organically and wrote about it.\n\n\n\nI didn't pitch them. They found it.\n\n\n\nTheir angle: \"No cloud requirement\"\n\n\n\nTurns out, Germans are extremely privacy-conscious (GDPR is a mindset, not just compliance).\n\n\n\nResult: Traffic exploded overnight. 40% of my users are now from Germany, Austria, Switzerland.\n\n\n\nLesson: Build with strong principles. The right market will find you - even if it's across the world and you didn't target them.\n\n\n\n3. SOFTWARE DIRECTORIES (\\~1,000 downloads)\n\n\n\nGot listed on:\n\n\\- AlternativeTo\n\n\\- Softonic\n\n\\- AppBrain\n\n\n\nDidn't pay for featured placement.

Be discoverable where your users are searching.\n\n\n\n4. REDDIT (Organic Comments) (\\~2,200 downloads)\n\n\n\nNot posting \"Check out my product!\"\n\n\n\nJust being helpful in r/productivity, r/software threads where people ask \"What PDF editor do you use?\"\n\n\n\nI'd share my experience, mention alternatives including mine, and let them decide.\n\n\n\nResult: People checked it out because I was helpful first, promotional never.\n\n\n\nLesson: Distribution = being present where your users have problems. Not announcing where you want attention.\n\n\n\n5. WORD OF MOUTH (\\~1,000 downloads)\n\n\n\nThe unsexy one that compounds:\n\n\\- Students sharing in college WhatsApp groups\n\n\\- People recommending in forums\n\n\\- Reviews mentioning it\n\n\n\nTakes time but becomes self-sustaining.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nTHE PATTERN I'M SEEING\n\n\n\nDistribution channels I can't control (others' tweets, blogs finding me, directories, word of mouth) &gt;&gt;&gt; channels I can control (my tweets, paid ads, official launches).\n\n\n\nYou can't force organic growth.

FREEMIUM CAN WORK FOR BOOTSTRAPPED\n\n\n\n10,000 free users = my marketing team\n\n50 paid users = fund development\n\n\n\nFew % conversion isn't impressive, but:\n\n\\- Free users create reviews, mentions, directories\n\n\\- Word of mouth scales\n\n\\- Paid users make it sustainable\n\n\n\nCurrently at $500/month. Goal: $10k/month (need 1,000 paid users).\n\n\n\n4. LAUNCH DAY DOESN'T MATTER\n\n\n\nProduct Hunt flopped. Nobody remembers.\n\nHackerNews flopped. Nobody cares.\n\n\n\n3 months later: 10,000 downloads from sources I didn't plan for.\n\n\n\nGreat products compound. Bad launches don't matter if you keep shipping.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nCHALLENGES I'M FACING\n\n\n\n1. CODE SIGNING ($400/year)\n\n\n\nWindows installer isn't signed. Shows scary warning. Losing downloads because of this.\n\n\n\nCan't afford it yet at $500/month.\n\n\n\n2. CUSTOMER SUPPORT (Just Me)\n\n\n\nHandling 20+ support emails per week alone.\n\n\n\nNeed to automate or hire but can't afford yet.\n\n\n\n3. FEATURE CREEP\n\n\n\nEveryone wants their specific use case: OCR, cloud sync, collaboration.\n\n\n\nStaying focused on \"lightweight offline PDF editor\" is hard when revenue is slow.\n\n\n\n4. IMPOSTOR SYNDROME\n\n\n\n$500/month isn't impressive. Seeing others with $50k+ MRR makes me feel like I'm failing.\n\n\n\nBut have to remember: I started at $0. Progress is progress.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\n\n\nShort term:\n\n\\- Hit $3k/month (need 300 paid users)\n\n\\- Afford code signing certificate\n\n\\- Translate to German (my biggest market)\n\n\n\nLong term:\n\n\\- $10k/month = quit day job\n\n\\- Hire part-time support\n\n\\- Build team of 2-3\n\n\n\nNot trying to be a unicorn. Just trying to build a sustainable business solving a real problem.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nQUESTIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY\n\n\n\n1. How did you find your unexpected market? (Like my Germany discovery)\n\n\n\n2. At what revenue did you quit your day job? (Thinking about this at $3k/month)\n\n\n\n3. Code signing / legal costs - when do you bite the bullet and just pay?\n\n\n\n4. How do you stay motivated when growth is slow but steady?\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about:\n\n\\- Bootstrapping without funding\n\n\\- Building solo\n\n\\- Distribution tactics that worked (and failed)\n\n\\- Pricing strategy\n\n\\- Geographic expansion\n\n\\- Dealing with impostor syndrome\n\n\n\nNot here to sell - genuinely want to learn from this community. You all have been through this before.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading.",

One thing I'd add from my experience shipping MVPs for clients: the 'zero marketing spend' framing undersells what you actually did. Community engagement, word of mouth, and showing up in forums IS marketing. It's just not paid marketing. The distinction matters because founders read 'zero budget' and think distribution happens by itself. It doesn't. You clearly put in the work on distribution, just not through ads.

The founders who do well seem to find the 2-3 places where people already have the problem, not blast it out to everyone.\n\nQuestion though - at $10 one-time, how are you thinking about the long term math on this? u/finalbuilder brought up the support load thing and that's something I keep going back and forth on.

Ask upfront: \"Is there an internal team involved in this project?\" Not confrontational, just standard discovery. Their answer (or dodge) tells you a lot.\n\n  \n2. Replace free demos with paid discovery. Even a small paid phase ($500-1500 depending on scope) filters out everyone who is not serious. Real buyers are happy to pay for it because they get value either way. Time-wasters disappear instantly.\n\n  \n3. If they push back on paid discovery, offer a short presentation or walkthrough of similar past work instead. Never custom-build anything before money changes hands.\n\n  \n4. \"Show us what you can do\" without any commitment from their side = free consulting. A legit client will have a budget, a timeline, and a decision-maker on the call. If any of those three are missing, be cautious.\n\n  \n5. Set a personal rule: no more than 2-3 hours of unpaid work before any engagement. That is enough for a proposal and a rough wireframe, not a full week of building.\n\n  \nThe silver lining is that once you start charging for discovery, the quality of your leads goes way up.

If they won’t commit time, money, or even a clear scope on their side, it usually means they’re still in “shopping for ideas” mode, not “buying a solution” mode.\n\nA few things I learned the hard way:\n\nIf they already have an in-house team but don’t mention it early, assume they’re benchmarking you against internal options. That doesn’t mean walk away immediately, but it does mean no free builds. At most, high-level walkthroughs or concept sketches.\n\nPay attention to how concrete the conversation is. Buyers talk about timelines, budgets, and consequences if something doesn’t get done. Idea collectors talk about possibilities, features, and “what ifs”.\n\nOne simple filter that saves a lot of pain is flipping the ask. Instead of “I’ll build a demo”, say “let’s do a paid discovery or pilot”. Even a small paid engagement changes the dynamic completely. The people who disappear were never serious. The ones who stay usually are.\n\nAnd honestly, some of this only comes with getting burned once or twice. It’s not stupidity, it’s tuition.\n\nThe fact you caught it and are asking how to spot it earlier means you’ll handle the next one much better.",

Just 4-5 lines max.\n\n* What we did this week\n* What's in progress\n* Any blockers or things I need from them\n* What's coming next week\n\nThat's it. No fancy dashboard. No Loom video.

And the ones who still wanted calls? At least now the calls had context.\n\nSounds basic, but I resisted this for years thinking \"I'll just update them when there's something big to share.\" Turns out clients don't want big updates.

          "body": "You're going to get 30 comments in this thread all saying \"we're the best CRM for small business.\" So instead of adding to that pile, here's what I'd tell a friend in your position.  \n  \nBefore you pick anything, answer three questions:  \n  \n**1. How many people will touch the CRM daily?** Under 5 users? You don't need enterprise anything. Most small teams end up paying for 40 features and using 4. That gap is where \"admin work and complexity\" creeps in.  \n  \n**2. What broke first when your spreadsheets fell apart?** Usually one of two things: either follow-ups stopped happening because no one could track where a lead was in the process, or you lost visibility because info lived in three different places. Knowing which one broke first tells you what to prioritize.  \n  \n**3. Do you need a CRM or a CRM + marketing platform?** If you need email sequences, landing pages, ad tracking: look at HubSpot or ActiveCampaign. If you need clean pipeline visibility, follow-up automation, and a tool your team will actually open every morning: that's where we built Bigin. We deliberately left out the marketing suite because cramming everything in is how \"simple\" CRMs stop being simple.  \n  \nWe're obviously biased, but the honest answer is: the best CRM for your team in 2026 is the one with the shortest gap between signup and \"oh, this actually helps.\" If that's us, great. If not, at least the framework above saves you from wasting three months on the wrong tool.  \n  \nHappy to answer specifics if you want to compare options",

      "selftext": "Close friend runs a restaurant, and our friend group has this tradition of showing care through the dumbest pranks possible. So year ago, for his birthday dinner I made a set of QR codes for his tables. Custom graphic frame around each one, restaurant name, looked almost professional from a distance. The actual QR part was ugly basic white squares though. And every single one linked to Never Gonna Give You Up. We put them on every table. Guests scanning for the menu, getting rickrolled instead. Small group of friends, everyone cracking up. Job done. After the party the codes came down obviously, but the idea of having proper QR codes in that restaurant stuck with me. Started looking for generators that could actually produce something decent. Turns out most of them are ugly anyway, the better ones want monthly subscriptions, and almost all of them route scans through their own servers first. Since I wanted to learn Python for years already, this became my excuse. Wrote a basic generator for myself. Then every week I was modding or adding something new. Logo embedding, vCard support, batch CSV processing, looked for ways for NFC integration, SVG export. Classic case of a side project spiraling out of control, except this one turned out to be useful.\n\nStarted showing it to people I know. Friends asked for codes for their businesses. Then friends of friends. Lawyers and doctors were the first surprise. They liked the idea of vCard QR codes (digital business cards) but absolutely refuse to put their phone numbers, emails and office details into random online generators. Makes sense, right? Good thing that my tool generates everything offline :D Few transport companies and waste management businesses came, mostly my current cooperators from main business (I produce steel packets for foundries). QR codes on their trucks and trailers linking to company website, turning every vehicle into a moving billboard. From there I managed to upsell a few NFC cards that look like regular business cards but actually collect Google reviews and have vCard QR on them. For the review links I made a custom scraper that pulls business ID from Google without having to check it manually by the owner. Customer taps their phone, review form opens, one scan of vCard and contact added, done.\n\nThen I hit an interesting niche. A national museum I visited had their collection digitized already, so I figured it's worth a shot to collect all the links and generate QRs for them. Built a scraper that pulled around 300 artworks from their website, then mass generated unique QR codes for each one. Foreign visitor scans the code next to a painting, gets the description in their own language. Two features in one pipeline. Sent them the offer by email and got nothing. Went to their offices in person and boom, suddenly they're interested since I took care of the problem from A to Z. After that it just kept going through word of mouth. Car detailers, dental clinics using review stands, real estate agents, an architecture firm needing vCards for their entire team. All from Poland. All through people who knew people.\n\nThat's basically where I'm at now, a bit stuck. My network is tapped out. Everyone who could have needed codes from people I know already has them. Revenue is real but modest. This has been purely organic so far, zero marketing, not a single euro spent on ads or content. Now I'm thinking about whether Instagram and TikTok make sense for something like this. The visual side is there for sure, before and after of a generic pixelated code vs a branded one is satisfying content. But I'm one guy in Poland selling a niche B2B product. Not sure short form video is where my actual buyers spend their time.\n\nHas anyone here been at this exact crossroads? Is such a service still relevant in the current era of AI hype? Side project making money through network, network drying up, trying to figure out the next move. Especially curious if anyone used Instagram or TikTok to sell a niche B2B service, or if that's just making content for other marketers to watch.\n\nWould appreciate any honest thoughts. Not dropping business name or site because I want real feedback, instead of most posts these days that sell a fake story and guide you to their product. I can send you a QR for the rickroll though :D",

          "body": "The museum case is really interesting because that is a repeatable playbook, not just a one-off win. Every museum, gallery, historical site, and tourist attraction in Poland (and Europe) has the same problem: foreign visitors who cant read the local language. You already solved it end-to-end for one museum. Now you have a case study.\n\n  \nFor scaling beyond your network, I would skip Instagram and TikTok for now. Your buyers are operations managers and marketing directors at institutions, they are not scrolling reels. What actually works for niche B2B like this:\n\n  \n1. Cold outreach with the museum case study. Find 50 museums and cultural institutions in Poland, send a short email with before/after photos and the specific problem you solved. Keep it to 3 sentences plus a photo. In person follow-up worked for you once, it will work again.\n\n  \n2. Google My Business and local SEO. People search for things like \"QR code kody firma Polska\" or \"NFC wizytowki\". A simple landing page targeting those keywords in Polish could bring inbound leads without any ad spend.\n\n  \n3. Partner with print shops and sign makers. They already serve the exact businesses that need your product. Offer them a referral cut or white-label arrangement. One good partnership could replace your entire personal network.\n\n  \n4. The dental/medical niche is gold. Doctors care about privacy (your offline generation is a real differentiator here) and they talk to each other. One happy dentist in a professional group chat is worth more than 10k TikTok views.\n\n  \nThe rickroll origin story is genuinely great marketing material though. If you ever do content, lead with that. People remember stories like that way more than feature lists.",

What types of products or services are they likely to be using? Now, look for the people that sell that. Get to know them and their business and find out what other events they go to. The idea is to leave an impression and keep yourself fresh in their mind.

I've found that  CPAs, fractional CFO/CIOs, business consultants, and Insurance agents that write a lot of Cyber policies are great referral partners for us. When I go to networking events, these are the people that I try to talk to the most.

If a customer contacts you through another channel, you can just copy and paste a standard message advising them you only take requests through specific platforms.\n\nThird, immediately put all scheduled pickups into a calendar app and set reminder notifications if needed so you won't forget.

          "body": "The calls are where you are bleeding the most and probably do not even realize it. When you are on a job site dumping a load, you physically cannot pick up the phone. That person calling you right now is already dialing the next hauler on Google by the time you see the missed call.\n\nTwo things that fix this without adding overhead:\n\n1. Auto text-back on missed calls. Most business phone apps handle this - OpenPhone, Google Voice, even some carrier features. Someone calls, you can not answer, they get an instant text: \"Hey, on a job right now. What do you need hauled and what is your zip?\" Now they are in a conversation with you instead of moving on to your competitor.\n\n2. Stop quoting live over the phone. Send everyone a standard message: \"Shoot me a photo of what needs hauled and your address, I will get you a price within the hour.\" Batch your quoting into 15 minutes at the end of each work block instead of getting pulled out of work constantly.\n\nThe operators I have watched go from one trailer to three did not get there by working harder. They got there by making sure every lead that came in actually converted to a booked job. Right now you are probably losing 40-50% of people who reach out - not because they said no to your price, but because they called someone who picked up.",

You need a booking system that can handle scheduling conflicts and send you reminders, or at least a simple calendar app where you block out travel time between jobs. One thing I came across while looking into this kind of thing is ServiceStories.\n\nIt's mainly for turning your completed jobs into content automatically, but the reason I'm mentioning it is because if you're documenting what you're doing anyway (even just taking a quick photo and some notes), you're building proof of your work that can bring in more customers down the road. Might help with the bigger picture of scaling this thing beyond just you and a trailer. For right now though, get a calendar system locked down.\n\nGoogle Calendar with reminders every 30 minutes before a job would've saved you that landfill trip.

It’s organization.\n\nStep one: stop taking jobs through random channels. Pick one booking method. Either a simple booking form or one business number. Everything funnels there. No scattered WhatsApp threads and phone notes.\n\nStep two: time blocks, not “whenever I can.” Decide your available pickup windows in advance and only offer those. For example, 6–7pm, 7–8pm, Saturday 9–11am, etc. If a slot is full, it’s full. That alone will prevent stacking jobs.\n\nStep three: use a basic scheduling tool or even a shared calendar. Every job gets:  \nClient name  \nAddress  \nDump type  \nLandfill plan  \nPayment status\n\nNo job exists unless it’s on the calendar.\n\nStep four: buffer time. If landfill closes at 5, your last dump run should target 3:30 or 4. You need margin. Side hustle mistakes usually come from overestimating how much fits in a day.\n\nFinally, consider raising prices slightly. When demand exceeds capacity, price is the lever. Fewer jobs at higher margins is better than burnout and missed appointments.\n\nYou don’t need more hustle. You need structure.",

The problem is my overhead has scaled way faster than my revenue. I started with one front desk person and one MA. I’ve now added a second MA and a billing coordinator, and I still need more help. My monthly payroll went from $8K to $22K, and when you add benefits, payroll taxes, and workers’ comp, I’m spending close to $30K/month on staff for a practice that’s netting $35K.\n\nThe bottleneck right now is admin. My front desk person is juggling phones, patient intake, appointment scheduling, referral coordination, and prior authorizations for procedures. She’s great but she’s one person doing a three-person job, and things are slipping: missed prior auths that delay procedures, phone calls going to voicemail, patients waiting 15 minutes just to check in. I know it’s hurting the patient experience.\n\nI’ve been doing the math on hiring a second front desk person and it’s brutal, $38–$42K salary plus $8–10K in benefits and taxes. That’s another $50K annual commitment when I’m barely keeping margins healthy. A friend who owns an urgent care told me he uses remote medical assistants from overseas who are HIPAA-trained and cost around $9–10/hour with no benefits overhead. He says they handle his phones, scheduling, and insurance verifications.\n\nI’m skeptical but intrigued. For any small practice owners who’ve used virtual medical assistants to scale: how did you handle the transition? Did patients notice or care that the person answering the phone was remote? And how do you manage someone who isn’t physically in the office? I need to grow my team without destroying the margins that make this practice viable.",

Take that information and analyze it to understand what is actually going to save you from hiring…\n\nIf you took off pre-auth from the front desk, would she be able to do all the other things? If you outsourced reminders and reschedules, would you stop from having to hire another? Or is your front desk manually entering the new patient intake forms and a pre-visit text to complete before would handle half of those?\n\nThen, once you have your team makeup decided, build your process. What 6 things need to happen before every new patient appt? Returning patient?

You also need to convert the medical derm patients into cosmetic patients. The big chain groups in my area probably have 10 PAs to every MD/DO. A lot of their offices only have PAs in them. You can hire three to four PAs or one Doctor for the same money. Three PAs can see 3x the amount of patients as one Doctor can.\n\nMAs are also cheaper than Nurses and can do most of the things a Nurse can in a Derm office. It is rare for a Nurse to be in a Derm office, unless it is an NP who is seeing patients and billing.\n\nYou also need to increase your volume. 28 patients per day is a comfortable pace. Again, the large offices in my area are seeing 60+ per providers in a 10 hour day. You might not want to see that many as it can detract from the quality of care, but shooting for 45 per day is probably a good place to be.\n\nLastly, having an experienced biller and prior auth person is worth their weight in gold. They can ensure you are billing insurances the proper amount and patients are getting the medicines you want them to have.\n\n  \nEdit: Additional ways to increase revenue: there are companies that will give you compounding machines. They are kind of like Nespresso machines, but you can direct sell acne, rosacea etc… treatments to your patients. IDK the exact pricing, but it’s something like $20 per and then you sell it for $40. No insurance or pharmacy are involved and the patient gets the product right in your office. \n\nyou should also be selling your preferred skin care line in your office, like skinceuticals. Or you can create your own with white labeling.",

Not intentionally, you need to keep control. Having said all that, from a pure scheduling standpoint, I would think there are tons of resources that would be safe, but if you were going to process the inbound customers, they are going to have to provide information that others should not see. I use all of my portals from my medical practitioners to upload things securely and to make sure that I’m talking only to nurses, and in fact, I know these nurses because when I visit I meet them.

          "body": "Yeah, you’re not alone. The espresso machine thing is basically a rite of passage. Every small business owner has some version of “the one piece of equipment that knows exactly when to die for maximum damage.”\n\nThe part that nobody warns you about is how much of the job is just… maintenance. Not the creative stuff, not the reason you started. Just keeping the machine running (literally and figuratively). Payroll, permits, suppliers changing prices, a key employee calling in sick on your busiest day. It compounds.\n\nThe paperwork thing is real too. You open a coffee shop because you love coffee and community, and then you spend half your time in spreadsheets tracking beans and milk margins.\n\nTwo things worth saying though. First, the fact that you’ve kept it going for a couple of years already puts you ahead of most. The majority of coffee shops don’t make it past 18 months. You’re past the survival phase even if it doesn’t feel like it.\n\nSecond, if the “should I just get an office job” thought is showing up a lot, it’s worth taking seriously. Not as a sign to quit, but as a signal that something in the operation needs to change. Usually it means you’re doing too much yourself. The owners who last are the ones who eventually find a way to stop being the person who has to handle every crisis personally. That might mean a strong second-in-command, or systems that reduce the daily firefighting, or just cutting the parts of the business that drain you the most for the least return.\n\nBut also, some days just suck and the espresso machine breaks and you’re allowed to be annoyed about it.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

I direct them and I manage them, but I no longer have to do every single little small pain in the butt thing that almost killed me. \n\nI had a phase where a lot of people left and that really discouraged me  and i thought about quitting but, I’ve actually ended up hiring a much better quality of employees and that is the best feeling in the world. I love my current staff so much and I couldn’t have said that two years ago for sure.\n\n I’m also able to pay myself a nice wage probably more than I could make in an office or if I was working alone, so I am grateful for that.

It’s funny, I saw this post right after I volunteered at my young ones school for the day, to help different departments of the school do different projects. I got home at 1pm from that and was GASSED. More tired than anything I’ve done in business. And those folks are making 50-60k working super hard every single day.\n\nI left there and felt fortunate I’m able to choose my hours I work, and be flexible to not be told what to do or where I need to be. We’re really lucky as biz owners. Just get out there and do something else for a day, and you’ll quickly come back to your senses on it. And take some days off to recharge if you’re feeling this way. Also hard to do but sometimes lost revenue is worth the expense of taking care of yourself to recharge.",

In all honesty, the accounting, our book work aspect isn’t overwhelming and it’s pretty common for people in sales to actually deliver the product so that’s not necessarily weird.\n\n\nFor me what might be challenging is constantly motivating yourself.

Now I’m the one who needs help.\n\nI own a small business that I started and fully funded myself. I own 100% of it. I do everything — the work, bookkeeping, taxes, invoicing, customer relations — all of it. and I've been in business for over 2 years\n\nWhen I first started, things were manageable. I paid for materials, tools, and consumables in cash. No loans, no credit cards, no investors, no debt. It felt safe and controlled.\n\nBut as the months went on, the business kept growing. Bigger clients came in. I moved into B2B work with net 30 terms. At first, I was balancing that with smaller cash-paying jobs, which helped with flow.\n\nNow I’m almost strictly B2B. Dee to me not having any physical time for the smaller intricate jobs that takes 6 hours to complete.\n\nAnd my cash flow is terrible.\n\nOn paper, I’m growing every month. I have recurring clients. Work keeps increasing. But because of net 30 terms, I’m constantly waiting to get paid while needing to buy materials for the next round of jobs. I’ve gotten to the point where I’m worried I won’t be able to afford next month’s materials — even though I have the work lined up.\n\nI’ve tried loans which i cant get approved due to my credit and being high risk and grants, but most “grant” programs I find just want fees to “move my application forward,” which feels sketchy. I don’t want to bury myself in bad debt.\n\nThis situation has stressed me to the point of mental exhaustion. I’ve honestly thought about shutting everything down just to relieve the pressure — even though I know the business is growing and has real potential. It feels like I’m growing too fast and I can’t keep up financially.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with rapid growth creating cash flow problems like this?\n\nHow do you manage net 30 clients without constantly feeling underwater?\n\nI don’t want to quit. I just don’t know how to stabilize this.\n\nAny advice would mean a lot.",

New customers always get due in receipt. Only old ones get terms.\n\n4. Do not get structured loan like SBA to finance operations. That’s a business killer.

What you were dealing with is very normal, and when entrepreneurs are able to navigate this successfully, it’s the difference between a successful company and one that goes bankrupt \n\nNet profitability usually is not what kills a business, usually it is cash flow.\n\nI’ll start by saying, Don’t listen to the people that say “don’t accept net 30 terms”. Those people don’t understand the world and industry that you deal with. Unfortunately, in certain industries, the client sets the terms. We are playing in their world. We can decide to play with them, but that’s simply the way it is. Everything has pros and cons. The benefit to these commercial clients is that they are higher volume, higher value jobs. And usually less time spent/higher margins. The con is that they’re usually net 30+.\n\nSo yes, you can decide to not accept net 30 terms, but now you’re working with a different business model. I’m going to assume you excel in this field and have carved a niche, it is a TOTALLY acceptable business model. \n\nIn 2025, we were 48% commercial and 52% residential. Residential has its headaches, but we still show it a lot of attention and are constantly going after residential jobs, because it’s quick cash. This is what makes payroll.

That’s not what we want to do.\n\nIf residential simply isn’t an option for you, and there’s absolutely no way for you to get any money down on maybe larger projects on the commercial side, you have to be very careful at how fast you “grow”. In a business with a quick cash conversion cycle, this isn’t as much of a problem. \n\n1. I would recommend firstly finding all the ways you can decrease the overall cash conversion cycle. The first thing you can do is look at every single outgoing payment that you make monthly, and find a way to push those payments off so that the money isn’t taken out of your account 30+ days, or as long as possible.\n\nFor example, we put everything on credit cards. We know that cash isn’t due until at least 30 days from the statement close.\n\nWe have negotiated with all vendors to try to push back payments as late as possible. Sometimes it’s possible and sometimes it’s not. But that is always our goal, to push that outgoing cash as late as possible. \n\nBe very, very careful here, this is where financial discipline comes into play. This is where people get into loads of bad debt. You have to know what’s coming in, when it’s coming in, what you can float, Spreadsheets are your best friend. Don’t sleep on this part, it is VERY important. When this first started to become an issue this bought us almost 30 days for a/r to improve before we had to make those usual payments. It helped us get ahead of the curve and if you haven’t done this yet DO IT. \n\n2. Now you have to figure out how to decrease the cash conversion cycle even more based on income. Is there any possible way to get down payments, can you do more residential, factoring (in extreme case), but you get the idea.\n\n3. Monitor monito monitor monitor. Hire somebody to be in charge of your account receivable. This is a full-time job for us. Do absolutely everything you can to stay on these people. In the commercial world, putting liens on things, this is standard practice. They don’t take it personally, all it does is make you become one of the first people that they pay. We send a letter of intense often, and quiet, we are still working with to this day. We’ve never lost a commercial client by sending a letter of intent. All it does is make sure that it gets to the owner.\n\nHit me up sometime if you ever want to discuss this! There are a lot of things that you can do, but you have to be incredibly intentional",

A bank can give you the liquid cash a day or two after you ship (90%, with the other 10% released when your customer pays). You basically have a rolling loan with the bank, but because it's secured (against your invoices) you get lower interest payments than you would if you used an overdraft etc. \nYou can insure the invoices, so if a customer goes bankrupt and cannot pay, you are insured. Otherwise if you're not insured and that happens, you immediately owe the bank the unpaid value.

Avoid taking loans or using credit cards for the business until you complete #2 below.\n\n2. Find a professional accountant (this may be difficult during tax season). Ask them to review your books thoroughly. Have them analyze your Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L), Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement. If your balance sheet shows structural issues, your business model may be failing. Numbers do not lie.\n\n3. Review all Net 30 customers carefully. If customers exceed payment terms, your credit control process may be ineffective. Ideally, receivables should not go past due — even by one day.\n\n4. Sit down and evaluate 2–3 projects based on gross profit. Determine whether your margins truly cover the cost of capital. As a basic benchmark, if your profit does not exceed approximately 12%, your net return may not justify the risk. This may sound aggressive, but a business must outperform low-risk financial alternatives(Fix CD/ US Bonds). If you cannot outperform safer investment , your strategy may involve high risk with insufficient return. This is a fundamental business principle.\n\n5. Open a separate business account at the same bank. Transfer net profit into that account every time you receive payment. Do not use those funds until you have completed #2.\n\n6. Do not sign leases or long-term contracts until #2 has been completed.\n\n  \n",

Rapid growth is a good problem to have, but it can definitely feel overwhelming when cash flow doesn’t match the workload.\n\nA few things you might consider:\n\t1.\tBusiness credit or line of credit – Even a small credit line can bridge the gap between invoices and expenses. It gives you breathing room without relying on loans with bad terms.\n\t2.\tOutsource non-core tasks – Bookkeeping, invoicing, or even customer follow-ups can be handled by someone else. That frees you to focus on the work that actually brings in revenue.\n\t3.\tSegment your clients – Keep some smaller, quick-turnaround jobs that pay cash to maintain positive cash flow. Maybe hire someone part-time to handle these jobs, so you can focus on the bigger B2B contracts without sinking into a cash crunch.\n\t4.\tInvoice strategy – I know others already covered this but you can offer small incentives for early payment, or split larger invoices into smaller milestones to reduce the net 30 waiting period. Even partial upfront payment helps cover materials.\n\nHope sone of this helps and wish you the best!",

Consider developing a network of regular sources (estate sale companies, consignment shops looking to clear slow movers, even other resellers in different niches who might trade). You could also explore batching your sourcing into dedicated days rather than constant hunting, and maybe test raising prices to better reflect the time investment in curation.

No one but you should have the ability to release payments. \n- Post a job and hire a senior technical person who has been in the pressure vessel industry for good 15-20 years.\n- If unable to hire this experienced person full time, bring him on a retainer and learn the trade from him. He could be a consultant and he should be your guy! \n- Get your hands dirty. Learn the trade on the ground. For example, if you get a new order, tell the current team that you will work with them and finish the entire order with you on the line.  Even if it means working alongside the labor because unless you know the product/process inside out, they will/may keep fooling you. \n- Contact the customer that complained about the product. Check with your consultant that you will bring on board on what went sideways and consult your internal technical team as well. It could just be a case of order getting completed but the revenue may be pocketed by someone internally. \n- Investigate the dropped revenue and check with those clients who no longer deal with your company on what went wrong? \n\nTake immediate control before your family/employees eat the company out from the inside. Good luck! ",

          "body": "Hello! What made me stop and read this fully is your age. 21. Most people would just walk away in your situation but you are asking how to take responsibility and that is serious intent which matters.\n\nA quick context for you so you know where I am coming from:  I have worked with multiple agencies and founder-led businesses over the last 15 years. I have seen revenue collapse, family politics, silent mismanagement, and operational chaos up close. I don’t run a fabrication business, but I understand business structure, leadership drift, and how systems break. \n\nI would address your post as follows: \n\nFirstly, separate emotions from structure. Right now you have 4 parallel problems (as per your post):\n\n1. Technical knowledge gap\n\n2. Operational breakdown\n\n3. Financial opacity\n\n4. Family power dynamics\n\nIf you try to solve it all at once, you will end up drowning. \n\nHere is what your first 90 days should look like:\n\nMonth 1: Observe, don’t react: Sit inside operations daily. Shop floor. Client calls. Vendor calls.\n\nAsk dumb questions. Take notes.\n\nGet access to full financials; last 24 months. Cash flow, receivables, payables. Everything related to money coming in and going out. \n\nList all active orders and their status. Do not assume anything. Note it only if it exists on paper. \n\nYour only focus in Month 1: understand the business reality.\n\nMonth 2: Audit quietly\n\nCheck: Why did revenue fall from 7 to 2? Lost clients? Pricing? Delays? Quality issues?\n\nSpeak to 3–5 old clients directly. Ask what changed.\n\nCheck production rejection rate and complaint logs.\n\nMap who actually makes decisions today. On paper and in reality.\n\n\nIf you suspect mismanagement, you need data to validate it and not confrontation.\n\nMonth 3: Take controlled authority\n\nDefine weekly production targets.\n\nImplement a simple reporting rhythm (daily output, order status, cash position).\n\nSeparate relatives from roles. No one is “family” in a production meeting. Only role and output matter.\n\n\nNow about workers older than you: you do not earn authority through volume. You earn it through clarity.\n\nDon’t say “I think.”\nSay: “This is the plan for this week. Here’s what we are tracking.” Calm. Measured. Structured. Consistent.\n\nOn technical learning: You do not need to become the best welder. You need enough knowledge to not be fooled.\n\nStart with: Basic pressure vessel fundamentals\n\n1. ASME codes overview\n\n2. Welding process basics\n\n3. Quality inspection checklist\n\n4. Visit competitors quietly if possible\n\nSpend 60–90 mins daily learning for 6 months. This compounding matters. Most importantly, control cash first. Every rupee. A traditional business dies from cash suffocation before ego issues.\n\nAnd one hard truth: If your cousin is mismanaging, this will become political. So build numbers as proof before you build arguments.\n\nI don't think you are unprepared, you are just early to the game. If you want, you can reach out directly. I am not an industry expert in fabrication, but I can help you think through structure, authority, and 90-day execution without emotion. All the best!",

All of us spent many many hours in our youth working in the business, so even if we had been away for 5-15 years, we had familiarity and knew people. \n\nOne brother had been accepted to a PhD program and had 6 months until it starts and was just working ac lab job he could easily quit. \n\nAnother brother had an mbA and was working for a big-5 consulting firm but had been told he wasn’t on track to make partner. He had 12 months to find other work and they let him have up to a month off to go take care of the family business. \n\nBut also different from yours, the business finances were in shambles and none of us knew (not even my mom). \n\nI guess the reason I tell this story even though different is that these first months are critical. You keep saying that you will hire a manager once you have the money, but the whole thing could be lost by then. \n\nAfter everything was stabilized, we ended up selling to cousins running a similar business two towns over. It ended up great for my mom, who didn’t have to go start looking for her first job since college at age 56, but we had to jump in immediately to make sure the business was worth something to sell.",

You might be able to have A.I. figure out ways to at least give you some solid overviews. I'm a big believer in when I want to learn anything, I need to start focusing on the most basic, elementary elements before trying to say \"remember random things\".\n\nI view that like a tree analogy. You want to understand some of the roots, then the main part of the tree, eventually get to the branches, and finally get to the leaves. People get overwhelmed when they start with random leaves...   This is just about that business as a whole. Next piece would be simply being in and around the business and just absorbing what's going on. I also would probably have AI research a bunch of competitors and try to figure out what they are doing that's working well. If you have any documented SOPs, I certainly would be putting those into AI for analysis.\n\nThere's a lot more on the human side, like the distrust of the cousin and perhaps the element that your time is split between serious study and this business dilemma. If you actually have a controlling interest in this business, then I would think the three things you may want are either to learn it and run it yourself successfully, or to get more experienced management to come help turn it around and increase the value of it. Build water! Then either way, possibly set it up to sell. Right now, you don't want to set it up to sell if you're 65% down in revenue with problems.

It sounds like your father was the glue that kept the entire operation running and your sales will go to zero soon if no one else knows what’s going on.  A lot of small businesses go this direction unfortunately.  You may need to figure out how much runway you have - what are your costs / month. What are your employee wages / month. Then how much money is currently in the bank and how much do you have currently invoiced?  You may have a few months left before you run out of money and employees can no longer be paid. \n\nIf you insist on running it yourself you need to understand what gaps now exist in the business now that your father is no longer here. What specific business-critical roles/responsibilities belonged to him? which can be transferred to current employees, and which can be transferred to you, if you can learn them?. The rest may need to be hired out to a new employee. \n\nIt helps to create a value stream map of the entire business operation from quotation to product delivery. It can be a tedious process but can help you got a real handle on the workflow and identifying technical gaps. You may find that your dad was responsible for some technical/compliance related thing (like an engineering stamp?) that the entire business hinges on and also requires education/training/certification that will be impossible to replace from within.",

If revenue drops because of poor quality, so should the salary drop/firing happen. Burtal but this is how you get control in any business. Never hesitate to fire or give pay cuts to people if productivity or revenue is going low. Give a paycut on long breaks/poor output, and you will be surprised by the magic.   \n2. a) Customer is KING. Meet them, understand the issue, and understand what the problem is. Talk to the person/team in your company who manages it. If there is no one fill the gap. If there is someone already, then find the issue; either they need to be fired or schooled properly.   \n2. b) Also, if you are in a concentrated business where a few customers dictate a lot of revenue, and there is no other face right now, you will also need to step up or get a face. Impressions matter a lot many times, and you will have to see and decide. Don't be a person they can't trust. Don't promise what you don't know. It's better to speak less than wrong.   \n3. Have the right mix of patience + speed. Very important, don't let emotions make you hasty decisions. If you see someone even cheating on you, maybe even a cousin, the first step would be still play a friend and just migrate all important information from them to someone you trust or yourself, and then take actions againts them. Still, you need to have speed else world is too competitive, and someone else will eat your lunch. Competitors are always on the lookout for your weak spots. Same for the positive side, don't be overjoyous on large orders, have patience, scale with patience.   \n4. Find a mentor whom you can trust and who has seen at least 5x or more scale of your current business. Both points are equally important. This should not be the immediate priority, but definitely in the long run. But don't trust anyone blindly. \n\nMade a lot of mistakes in my early 20s, these are just to help. ",

Here's what I'd focus on in the next 30 days:\n\nBrand mentions without links actually matter a lot for entity recognition. Get mentioned in local news, industry blogs, chamber of commerce newsletters, even podcast interviews where your business name gets said out loud (transcripts get indexed). Google uses these to understand what your brand \"is.\"\n\nContent that explicitly answers \"What is [Your Business Name]?\" in multiple places. Create a detailed About page, a FAQ that addresses your specific services, and a few blog posts that use your exact brand name in the title and body naturally. You want Google to see 10+ pages across the web clearly stating what you do.\n\nBacklinks still help, but quality over quantity. One link from a relevant industry site or local news outlet is worth 50 directory links. Reach out to suppliers, partners, anyone who already works with you and ask if they'll add you to their partners page.\n\nLocal press is underrated. Send a simple story pitch to your local news about what makes your business different or any community involvement. Even a small mention with your name and what you do can shift Google's understanding.\n\nSpeed matters too. If someone already claimed your brand name on social platforms or review sites, make sure you're active there and linking back to your site. Consistency across channels signals authority.\n\nIf I had 30 days, I'd do local PR first (easiest brand mention), then content clarifying exactly what you are (FAQ + About pages), then reach out for 3 to 5 quality backlinks from real partners. You're not fighting an algorithm, you're teaching Google what your brand actually is.\n\nHave you checked Google Search Console to see what queries are actually triggering your site? Sometimes the issue is your pages aren't ranking for your own brand name, which is a different fix.",

Google's algorithm is essentially saying your competitor has stronger brand signals than you do for your own brand query.\n\nBased on what you've already done (which are good foundational steps), here's what I'd prioritize in your 30-day window:\n\n1. Brand mention campaigns - Reach out to past customers for testimonials that specifically mention your brand name. Even unlinked mentions help Google understand brand association.\n\n2. Strategic content creation - Create a 'Brand vs Alternatives' comparison page that naturally positions you as the original/primary option. This helps clarify the relationship to Google.\n\n3. Local press push - One solid local business feature with your brand name in the headline often carries more weight than dozens of directory listings.\n\n4. Google Business Profile optimization - Post regularly with your exact brand name in the content. The more fresh, brand-specific content, the better.\n\nThe key insight: Google needs to see consistent signals that YOU are the primary entity associated with your brand name, not just that you exist. It's about brand signal strength, not just SEO basics.\n\nWhat industry are you in? Sometimes there are industry-specific approaches that work faster.",

Strip all that away and you’re left with the actual hard part — getting someone who has no reason to care about you to believe you can solve their problem.\n\nI’ve spent 15+ years working with small service businesses and I’ll tell you what actually works at that stage because it’s stupidly simple and nobody talks about it.\n\nGo find people who have the problem you solve and tell them what’s wrong. For free. No pitch. No “let me know if you need help.” Just show them something about their own situation that they didn’t see before.\n\nI literally got my first handful of clients by looking at local businesses and pointing out specific things that were costing them money. Not vague “your marketing could be better” stuff. Specific, concrete, “you’re losing customers here and here’s why” stuff. Half of them didn’t hire me. The other half couldn’t hire me fast enough because nobody had ever just told them the truth without trying to sell them something first.\n\nThat’s the part the LinkedIn crowd will never teach you. At the startup and small business level, the sale happens when someone realizes you see their problem more clearly than they do. Not when you pitch them a solution. Not when you close them with some framework. When they feel genuinely understood by someone who clearly knows what they’re looking at.\n\nThe advice isn’t sexy. Go find 10 businesses this week. Look at what they’re doing. Tell them what you see. Don’t ask for anything. Some of them will ask you what it would cost to fix it. That’s your first clients.\n\nEverything else — the funnels, the content strategy, the sales process — that’s all stuff you build after you’ve proven you can actually help someone. Not before.",

Two strangers before you can graduate to the next steps.\n\nOnce you can consistently sell one on one, then start making content based on the exact questions people keep asking you.\n\nThen, and only then, scale it with paid.\n\nYour friend is partially right about sales, it's the lifeblood of any business and the reality is that most businesses are shockingly bad at it.\n\nIt is because you are guessing which of the four lanes you are actually in.\n\nFor now you just need to stick with one thing and get really good at that channel.\n\n[I explain the whole breakdown here if you want it laid out clearly.](https://youtu.be/5EjzIA-Zyd8?si=zuPJs2PCpaC2-Exn)\n\nIt will probably save you a lot of wasted time and money",

For so much of this, part of honing your craft comes from learning from the failures.  So be ok with failure.  But there’s no secret sauce to avoid the uncomfortable nature of being a startup.  Just do.  Crash and burn a few times.  Get better.  Crash and don’t burn.  Get better.  Achieve a modest landing with minor damage.  Get better.  Take off and land without issue.  \n\nOften the time spent searching for the perfect strategy is time that would be better spent just doing.  You see this with underperforming sales people.

Landlords will sometimes pay for tenant improvements to attract better tenants: more financially stable ones, or longer leases, or whatever.

Then it doesn't increase with your step-up, and you can handle paying it off separately from whatever other lease obligations you have.\n\nLast point: you sound like you have one foot out the door.

The other way to do it is have a certain construction budget built into the asking price and then negotiating how much to give based on desirability or credit worthiness of the tenant. Or refusing to do any TI at all.\n\nIt's a pretty common structure. It's what I use.  I include an interest rate as well and encourage my tenants to use cash or and sba loan if they don't like it.\n\nEvery expense the landlord has is rolled into rent. So is profit margin.  You as the tenants would be paying 100% of the cost no matter what.\n\nIf you leave early the landlord will want and have a legal claim for the unamortized cost of the improvements.\n\nIt's a stretch to assume these specific improvements increase the long term value of the space.  In ground grease traps and built kitchens tend to do that; not much else does.  \n\nYes the landlord gets cpi or rent increase percentage on the difference. He'd get this having higher base rent.\n\nYou could try and negotiate that the rent increase ends at the end of the amortized period or make a mental note to bring it up and ask for new stuff.\n\nWhen we do this sort of thing we have a hard bid from the contractor and any change order by the tenant they pay cash for.  In other words it's set scope, signed contract, fixed rent and fixed landlord contribution.\n\nPersonally I think the issue you have is why you would assume liability for the loan to build the improvements your cotenant needs for their business but you don't need for yours.  At the very least that should play into your discussions with her about what she pays vs. you.  You should be mindful that if she bails you still owe the rent and improvements payment.  I'd ask her to pay for what she needs seperately.",

I imagine a professional bookkeeper could cut that down, but it may take you a while to get to the level you can confidently close the books in significantly less time.\n\nMy feeling regarding bookkeeping is twofold: \n\n1) if you hire a bookkeeper, you can spend that time working on something else to actually grow the business instead of trying to learn accounting software that isn’t in your wheelhouse. While this is more true when the owner is a service provider (ie. go get one more client and it pays for the bookkeeper), I still think it is true in an e-commerce business as well. Go spend time on revenue generating tasks that you’re best at, and the bookkeeping will get done without you.\n\n2) e-commerce is one of the hardest types of bookkeeping, so doing it yourself will take a long time to get right. With sales tax and inventory in particular, it is just a longer process, whether it’s you or a bookkeeper handling it.\n\nIf you go the bookkeeper route, I would bet it wouldn’t be nearly as high as the $1500 per month you said. Maybe that’s what your CPA quoted you? Roughly half that is what I would think is reasonable.\n\nIf you do it yourself, you will get better! It gets easier each month as you learn the process.

I still do some manual work, but it's now down to about 30 minutes per month. Recently, after becoming more familiar with AI agents like OpenClaw, I've been considering testing an AI agent to replace the n8n automation.

Here's the thing, you've got a few paths depending on what's burning you most: Traditional bookkeeper is the obvious answer but you're right that $1,500/mo is steep when you're still building.\n\nThe upside is someone owns the whole mess and your Saturdays are free. Downside is you're still waiting on them to close the books and answer questions about what the numbers actually mean. AsteroCFO.Ai AI CFO is worth checking out for your situation.\n\nIt's $397/mo and handles the analysis side, you upload your financials and can ask unlimited questions in plain English about what's going on. Won't do the data entry or fix duplicates, but it'll tell you where money's going and spot issues fast. Trained by actual fractional CFOs so it's not just generic advice.\n\nDIY + better systems would be automating more of your imports and reconciliations, maybe switching to better connected apps. Cheapest option but doesn't solve teh time problem, just makes it slightly less painful. Most people at your revenue either go full bookkeeper or split it (bookkeeper handles data entry, something like AsteroCFO for the strategic stuff).\n\nBurning 10 hours monthly is costing you way more than $400 in opportunity cost anyway.",

Or monthly bookkeeping done at month end? 10 hours a month doesn't seem outlandish for monthly bookkeeping, but, might be reducible. 10 hours on TOP of monthly bookkeeping though, should be reducible.   \nBookkeeping nowadays can be so frustrating and time consuming with all the apps and integrations!  Bookkeeping takes longer and is less accurate the more \"complexity drivers\" your business has.  \nThe key is to figure out what those complexity drivers are, and how much control you have over them with both your digital and also real life processes.  \nUsing personal accounts to pay for business expenses, and vice versa, is huge complexity driver that can disappear simply by the business owner stopping that bad habit.  100% control on that one.  Employees, AP, AR, Inventory, all varying complexity drivers you're stuck with.  What real life processes and standardizations can happen to reduce their time suck?  \nE-commerce is a HUGE complexity driver, greater than we may recognize.  Though, I think you're feeling it right now!!  Ask your accountant if they can see any ways to reduce the complexity here (and in other areas).  They may have some great insights.  I know many e-commerce firms use A2X, but I don't have experience there myself. In Canada, there's a great firm [https://www.financly.ca/](https://www.financly.ca/) (no affiliation, I just refer them cuz they're the best I know) that does e-commerce bookkeeping consultation.  Ugh, stripe, paypal, shopify... these are all the bane of my existence!   It's not you!  It's them!  \nPerhaps, instead of hiring a bookkeeper to do your bookkeeping (for now, but a great delegation option as you scale, so you can spend time growing the business, not in the trenches that you can outsource), is to find a bookkeeper who is e-commerce niched up to give you a couple of consultation meetings to help reduce the complexity of your workflows and maybe get some good time saving integrations working for you.  \nGod Speed my friend!",

Those issues you're describing are real and frustrating, and 15 hours lost is unacceptable.  \n  \nHere's the honest truth: Zoho CRM was probably the wrong product for your team size. It's built for mid-market and up, which is why you're hitting complexity and performance walls that shouldn't exist for a sub-10 person team.  \n  \nThat's exactly why we built Bigin, a separate CRM specifically for small businesses. Faster, leaner, no bloat. Pipeline management, email integration, and a mobile app that actually works during client calls. Starts at $7/user/month.  \n  \nMigration from Zoho CRM to Bigin is straightforward since it's the same ecosystem, so your data carries over clean. No two-day dashboard rebuilds.  \n  \nIf you're open to it, happy to walk you through the switch: [bigin.com](https://bigin.com/)  \nEither way, sorry again for the time lost. That's time you should've spent closing deals.",

          "body": "went down a rabbit hole on this last month because I was curious how B2B companies handle Reddit without getting torched for self-promo. The short answer is yes, it's worth monitoring, but you have to be strategic about how you show up. When someone asks for the best X in your city, that's gold.\n\nThose threads rank high in Google too, so it's not just the Reddit traffic, it's search visibility for months after. The trick is being helpful first. If you're just dropping your business name with no context, you'll get downvoted fast.\n\nBut if you can actually contribute to the conversation and your business genuinely fits, people appreciate it. I'd track your industry keywords and location mentions at minimum. Even just searching \"[your city] + [your industry]\" once a day can catch those recommendation threads before they're buried.\n\nSome businesses take it further and hire a done-for-you service to handle it completely. I stumbled onto Community Mentions while researching this, and they basically find the relevant threads, engage on your behalf, and handle the whole compliance side so you don't accidentally cross into spam territory. Seems like a smart move if you don't have bandwidth to monitor and post daily yourself, especially for B2B where the stakes are higher.\n\nFor local stuff tho, you could probably DIY it. Set up a few keyword alerts, jump in when it makes sense, be genuinely helpful. The ROI can be suprisingly good even from just a handful of comment clicks per month.",
