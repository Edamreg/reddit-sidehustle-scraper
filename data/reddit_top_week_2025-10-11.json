      "selftext": "this started completely by accident like 3 months ago. my mom asked me to help convert some old family VHS tapes to digital and I borrowed this capture device from a friend. took me forever to figure it out but once I did I posted in my neighborhood Facebook group asking if anyone else needed help with theirs.\n\nhonestly thought maybe 2 or 3 people would respond but I got like 30 messages in the first week lol. mostly older people who have boxes of tapes sitting in their basement and dont know what to do with them. I charge $8 per tape and $15 for photo album scanning (up to 100 photos). its not crazy money but im averaging like $400-500 a month now just doing this on weekends\n\npeople are SO grateful because most of them think their memories are just gonna deteriorate. had this one lady cry when she saw her wedding video from 1987 on a USB drive. that was pretty cool ngl\n\nive also started offering to organize the digital files into folders by year/event which adds another $20 and most people want that. thinking about expanding to old film reels too and the equipment is pricey but I got some money aside from Stаke and I wanna expand this operation.",

They send you push notifications as soon as things are listed so that you are the first one to be able to message and go get a really good deal if something is listed way below what it’s worth.\n\nIt’s something that you can do during your week “off”, but also something that you can do in the morning/evenings before and after work.  I’ve seen people in this sub that have commutes that are two hours long set up the app to look for things along their path to and from work and then they just set up pick ups/drop offs along their commute and they make a couple hundred extra bucks every week pretty much just doing the same thing they’re already doing.\n\nThat’s how most of these big guys are flipping cars, couches, phones, and other types of stuff. They aren’t paying the normal prices that you see, they’re paying way less and they’re doing that by being the first one to go get these deals from these people that underprice them either because they don’t know the value, or don’t care about the value and just want it gone. \n\nMy advice would be just find something that you know a lot about, use the app to look for you, and just pick up the best deals and make sure that you’re the first message. Pretty easy to make a couple hundred extra bucks a week.",

There are people around here that make things with 3d printers, photographers,  Dj's, pooper scoopers, etc. Start by telling friends and family, then advertise if you want to grow it into your primary source of income.\n\nI kinda wish I would have thought of the pooper scooper idea instead of cutting grass when I started because there's hardly any overhead, and the guys doing it around here are making a crapload of money. (Bad pun intended.)\n\nI would highly recommend doing something that doesn't require much overhead to do. Lawn care as a side gig was just my light duty personal truck, a push mower, weedeater, and blower. Lawn care as a company became  multiple trucks, trailers, zero turns, commercial equipment, dump trailers, etc. \n\nThat stuff coupled with maintenance, registrations, insurance, fuel, etc. gets pretty expensive and has added to my debt. It is good debt, but it still bugs me. No overhead means profiting day one.\n\nYou can even share the experience with your son. Let him help you come up with ideas, and even steer the ship a little.

          "body": "If you edit papers, would you enjoy writing ebooks? Well, it’s less so writing these days and more so coming up with a good story. AI can tell the story if you must, but it cannot do the creative side! \n\nThe second skill is creating an ebook cover. You’ll need a simple Canva or Photoshop tutorial for that.\n\nThe third (it’s not marketing) is meta. You must know how to publish correctly. This is tags, keywords, the story description itself, etc. \n\nIf you can do all three, great, you have the potential of $1k/mo+ minimum if you give this hell. I see a lot of amateurs make a lot of money in here, but that’s not really what it’s about. That’s the 1% doing full time, etc.\n\nYou’d likely start and put in an average of an hour a day. That would come out to an ebook going live maybe 2-3x a week, even more once you have the system down. \n\nDouble down on wins, let the losses go and learn what does and does not sell. As you get better with the above skills, you’ll make more. And, sales from stories layer.\n\nWhen you stop publishing, maybe 20% sales will stay, passive, continuing to sell. I’m over a decade in now and haven’t published to my catalog yet this year. \n\nMy recommendation is to first learn, then second try. Do not try first. This is nsfw art and there are rules and regulations. There are no three strikes because if you mess up, you’re likely done with that platform.\n\nAnyways, if you’d like to know more, you’re welcome to check out my profile. I have a discord server with info and some tips, and a critique area for stories and cover art. You can also advertise your new stories to my core audience of smut buyers and readers. Lots of new authors hanging out, and elder authors like myself as well.\n\nThis year helping new authors get going has been wild. It has spawned even a new ebook store I created. Being in the biz so long and a web dev, I couldn’t help but fill in what I see wrong with the industry. It’s not a lot of money, but so far there’s a handful of authors making grocery money at least!\n\nRighto, it is now very late and I am to bed. Welcome to check out my profile, join discord, read the how to, hang with the community and ask questions. We all love to share our sales, so there is a dedicated spot for everyone to throw up their monthly sales. 😀",

Most people are already stretched thin, and it's likely not the time to waste a bunch of resources on a risky venture as a total newbie.\n\nFor those who have never been able to scale a side gig to a profitable business, baby steps and even pauses may be needed to find a sustainable rhythm to put in the hours.

You pay an hourly fee and rent a grandma to go with you and skip lines at the bank or supermarket or whatever.. snacks are included\n\n \n- Google lens kind of app specialized in translating doctors handwriting\n \n\n- stray cat’s and dogs printing system. You would print ads in their fur so they go around town showing it off. The money would helo paying for sterilization and other vet bills for them. \n\n \n- lazy food brand - food for people too lazy to prepare it. Cookies already pre-socked in milk; nachos pre-covered in guacamole, pre-sliced oranges, etc\n\n \n- make religious “p0rn” movies - an electrician that enters a client’s house barefoot with a power drill in hand to fix a tv, while the client is a pretty woman in only a bath robe (like most movies of the kind), but the plot twist is that he really just fixes the tv, they pray together a few minutes and part their ways, no funny business.\n\n \n- tinder app for elderly people. Instead of the current tinder like/dislike mechanic, in works like uber and just connects them to the nearest available option.\n\n \n- poop gamification. A smart toilet where you login each time and compete with friends to see who poops the most in a week, or the heaviest. In my head and with the right skills, you could maybe even play poop battleship with friends\n\n \n- brown emergency lights (like the blue ones police attached to cars roofs in the movies) for when you need to get home fast to poop\n\n \n\nPs: I usually get my ideas at night when I suffer from insomnia, so some might be a bit delusional.. imagine the fun I had reading them in the morning though :)\n \n\nPS2: if any of you can get any of these ideas working, update me, I’d love to see it ahah",

Starting next semester, around December-January, I will be commuting to my campus all 5 days of the week, and will only be able to work my part-time job 2 days a week (12-15 hrs/week).\n\nI have a little over $10k in my savings, and I am currently trying to save up to move out of my parent’s house in the next 2-4 years. My paychecks now are usually $550-$650 every 2 weeks, but this will decrease immensely for those few months of being busy with school. \n\nWhat are some ways that I can make $200-$400 or more extra a month (Already do DoorDash, but even then I won’t have much time to do that next semester)?  \n\nEdit: I appreciate all replies , though I’d like to mention I prefer non-AI related ideas.

I killed everything, every campaign, every “plan.” I figured if nothing worked anyway, at least I’d stop setting my cash on fire. So I started posting whatever felt easy: some random designs on Etsy, a few half-finished ideas sitting on my laptop, nothing special.\n\nThen one of them sold. A tiny order, but man, it felt way bigger than it was. I threw up a few more listings, and somehow the ones I barely touched started selling more than the ones I’d spent hours on.\n\nPinterest was another absolute fluke. I'd made a few pins like, ages ago, never even bothered to optimize them, literally completely forgot they existed. Months later, I just randomly peeked out of curiosity and saw they were still sending people to my shop. Legit free eyeballs, somehow. Blew my mind.\n\nPinterest was another absolute fluke. I posted a couple quick pieces about what I was learning, didn’t push them anywhere, but they just kept popping up again and again. Each time they did, a few bucks showed up in my account like pocket change from nowhere.\n\nThen the whole AI craze hit. I tried a couple tools to remix trending designs into my own style. They made everything look fresh again and, I swear to god, they weirdly out-sold my 'perfect' versions that I'd slaved over for days. Go figure.\n\nNone of this made me rich, don't get me wrong. It just stacked up, a sale here, a few bucks there, until 'no ads' didn't mean 'no money.' I still honestly don't really get why just chilling out and letting things happen worked better than trying so hard, but hey, maybe that's the whole damn point.",

      "selftext": "Howdy, currently looking to make at least 200 bucks more on the side as a night shift guard. I have a lot of free time at work, was wondering if there is something like filling out surveys or anything that may need labor. Rent went up not by much but just enough to start effecting my savings by a concerning rate if I did my math correctly. Would like to get a second job but none are willing to work with my schedule that are in my area. Any ideas would greatly be appreciated. ",

      "selftext": "LinkedIn Content Workflow Completed!\n\nToday was a massive milestone. After weeks of focused tinkering, I successfully launched my second major client-facing workflow from end-to-end in n8n: a complex, multi-step LinkedIn content generator.\n\nThis is the backbone of my initial offering. The flow starts with an input form (soon to be a schedule trigger) where I outline the client's weekly content goals. From there, the magic happens:\n\n1. LLM Generation: It produces the complete post copy: hook, body, CTA, and relevant hashtags.\n2. Visual Creation: It seamlessly calls an image generation API to create a polished, accompanying visual.\n\nThe part I’m most proud of—the step that makes it a true client product is the Human-in-the-Loop Approval.\n\nThe entire draft (text + image) is sent directly to the client's designated Slack channel for review. They simply hit 'Approve' or 'Deny.'\n\n* Deny: The workflow loops back, and a new version is immediately generated.\n* Approve: It automatically posts to their company's LinkedIn page.\n\nSeeing that final, approved post go live was a huge relief. Building a system with a solid client approval step feels like transitioning from a personal project to a viable product.\n\nThis milestone is perfectly timed, as I have a meeting with this client next week. We’ll be discussing how to expand beyond content and start automating more crucial business areas, like their sales and marketing processes. Getting this content workflow locked down gives me a huge confidence boost going into that discussion.\n\nThe Slack approval, while functional, feels a bit clunky. For those running similar client-facing automations, how have you streamlined or handled effective human-in-the-loop approvals? Any better integration ideas for speed and simplicity?",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone! I’ve spent the last two years building a small horticulture business, and this season went alright. With the growing season winding down, I’m looking for winter-friendly ways to cover bills without dipping into savings. My goal is about $1,000 per month for personal expenses, and business costs are already covered. I’ll still be working with my plants, but I’ll have a lot more free time soon and would love something flexible and practical to fill the gap.\n\nI did DoorDash last winter and it wasn’t great, though I’ll do it again if nothing else works out. Ideally, I’m looking for options that are legit, part-time, low upfront cost, and can reasonably bring in around $250 a week through the winter.\n\nHonesty just looking for anything to avoid having to do doordash again. I've applied to a few jobs but haven't heard back yet so now I'm here. Any advice is greatly appreciated! ",

Therefore, the children specifically do.\nThere is a term known as \"doom scrolling\" which children just scroll and scroll, vid after vid.\n\nEach view is. Important.\n\nThe vids u watch on media? You are paying people big bucks.\n\nFor some vids under certain categories they are getting paid $20/1000 views.\nImagine some dude whos a banker makes a vid of \"every day life of a banker\" and he gets 100k views.\n\n20x 100 = $2k. Funny thing is, vid probs took him 10 hrs to edit max, and maybe 2hrs of recording.\n\nSo u do the math there.\n\nIt compounds ontop of itself.\n\nThe only reason u don't see more of it is because its very tiring. Ppl get burnt out real fast. Finding clips is hard. As ppl nowadays are copyrighting your content.\n\nThen theyre watermarking it with fade away text that reappears every 5 seconds.\n\nOr they watermark it with diagonal text.\n\nEtc\n\nUnderstand that thjs isnt easy.\n\nGrowing a channel isnt hard.\n\nMAINTAINING IT is.",

I added meal tracking, a “stinkiest day” insight, and some affiliate links for gut health stuff just to see what would happen. Now there are over 1,600 farts logged from 60 countries… and today I made my first $1. It’s not much, but that was the goal. Just make one dollar from something I built.

Also, you need to find a good tenants to take care of your property. \n\nVending machine, you have to find locations and buying stocks, refilling the machines and maintaining the machines. \n\nDigital Courses, you have create the course and keep it update and most difficult part is to market your self and sell.\n\nOnly true passive income is, if you are wealthy and can take risk. You can be an investor in starts up or go heavy on stock with a good finical advisor. \n\nI might be wrong, but let me know what you think. \n",

So it can be completely passive if you sacrifice part of the profits.\n\nTrading on the market can also be done by companies, but again for a fee, and they will probably trade more conservatively. \n\nVending machines, you can hire employee's who do all the maintenance and refilling. You need a way to make sure they don't steal money though, so you might need to invest in a system that keeps track of how much money is in each machine that can be accessed via 5g. And then hire someone who double checks and maybe also does the accounting.\n\nDigital courses can also be outsourced to someone who does like to make them for a monthly wage and isn't interested in freelancing them. A teacher essentially. Marketing can be outsourced to marketing agency. Might as well have your own elearning platform setup by then.\n\n\nSo yes, for the poor its hard. But all of these can become passive once you are drowning in money and can pay people to do yhe work for you.

      "selftext": "Every post I see here lately is some dumb get rich quick scheme or AI tool scheme making fake products or “influencers” it’s just dumb and it contributes to internet rot this immoral and it’s slop. \n\nTo make passive income It’s not hard. Basically what I did is take a hobby I love (I made modifications to video games) and try to do it to the best of my ability. Try to be as professional as possible, push myself to learn and grow. That’s it. Push your hobbies into a professional sphere. That’s how to do it. \n\nAgain this was a hobby I did for fun but it started with making video game modifications. Personally I started make a small amount of passive income (300$ a month) via hosting the modifications on a site that generates ad revenu from adds in the sides bars of the site, then made an official company out if it down the line for myself (just me as owner operator and hobby in free time). Started occasionally hiring one time payment contractors to do tasks for me- built a catalog of successes partnered with a game company and started creating content for them which if used I make money off the sales my work is used in. This turned it into about 900$+ a month some months over 1000$ a month passive income. \n\nNow I’m slowing that down and decided to write a sci-fi book. It’s in total about 350 pages, will be part of a series and I’m working to make it as professional as possible with the goal to publish. Again this is a hobby. It’s for fun. But if I get it published my fun could net me well who knows anywhere from 2,000 or 5,000 to 15,000 off the bat plus any extra the book makes. I’ll assume lowest so let’s just say 2000 or something for a book that took me 9 months for fun in my free time. I learned how to write better, and I’m learning what publishing looks like and how to sell it to them. \n\nTo me that’s the legit way to make passive income. It takes more work. More time it’s not a get rich quick scheme it build skills and if you want to constantly push yourself in your hobbies and take it to a professional degree then it’ll happen. ",

Then I moved on. Months later I peeked just out of boredom and saw those same pins still sending people my way. I hadn’t logged in forever. Felt like finding cash in old jeans, but online.\n\nMedium did the same thing. I tossed a couple posts about what I was messing with on Etsy, nothing polished, didn’t share them anywhere. They somehow kept getting read. Every few weeks I’d get a tiny “you got paid” ping and just laugh.\n\nEtsy kept doing its own thing too. Some listings with reviews kept selling. Even old trend stuff I swore was dead still sold a few here and there. Phone goes cha-ching while I’m half-asleep, still one of my favorite sounds ever.\n\nAnd the nerdy bit: I figured out a way to get my old pages showing up on Google again faster. Nothing fancy, just me tinkering too much. But it worked. That slow drip of visitors never really stopped.\n\nNone of this was planned. I messed around, forgot half of it, and somehow some of it stuck. Tiny, low effort, kinda messy but it keeps paying for caffeine, and that’s good enough for me.",

Sometimes I put inside a painting I made myself, sometimes I'm not putting anything, sometimes I put clothes that I don't use anymore, or books, or some snacks, and people really buy it lol \nIt's not really passive income as you still have to send them yourself, but it's something that still generates an income.

          "body": "When I started looking for passive ways to make money online last year,first thing I learned is that passive is a very misleading word. Most things that actually work in 2025 aren’t passive at the start, they’re front loaded. You put in focused work upfront, build the system once, then let it earn for you over time. For me, that looked like learning how to package what I already knew and was already doing for others into simple digital products and automating the delivery + marketing side of it. It didn’t happen overnight, but after the setup, the results started compounding quietly in the background.\nIf you’re stretched thin right now, don’t chase income streams build one smart system that can eventually buy your time back. That’s the turning point most people miss when they’re drowning in work",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training glfrom beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free! At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

These websites will give small rewards for logging in everyday which ranges from 30 cents to 1 dollar a day. That isn't a crazy amount but if you add all of the available websites (there are around 60+ now) that is around $42 a day, which is $1260 in a month if you collect every 30 days. The reason why these sites give out money is because they get a tax write off similar to how a business would donate to a charity except instead of a charity they donate directly to you. They make more money doing a write off than the actual money they give everyday.   \nAnother thing you can add is these sites have 'bonus packages' essentially giving you a bonus that is more than any amount you spend.   \nSo if a site gives you $50 and you get $100 total bonus, you will playthrough that amount 1 time then redeem. Profiting $50 and also profiting any of the login bonuses you've been collecting. If you have any questions or are interested in the spreadsheet I grab from let me know!",

      "selftext": "I’ve been deep in the AI Influencer space for a while now, building hyper-realistic digital personalities that grow on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, so I figured I’d share what it’s *actually* like.\n\nWhen I started, I thought it’d be easy: generate a few images, post them with trendy captions, and watch it blow up. Reality check, it’s not that simple. The first versions looked uncanny, the captions were too generic and ChatGPT written, and engagement was dead. It took months of experimenting with tone, personality, and storytelling to make the AI feel “human” enough to connect.\n\nOnce I got the system right with consistent aesthetic, defined persona, and smart posting plan, things started compounding fast. The crazy part? Once an AI Influencer gains traction, it scales way easier than a real person: still no one knows me, I can collab with anyone, no creative blocks. You can test 10 content styles a day, clone audiences across platforms...\n\nA few things I learned:\n\n* People don’t care if it’s AI, they care if it's funny or provides some sort of value.\n* Personality &gt; Perfection. A bit of imperfection sells authenticity.\n* Treat your AI Influencer like a startup, not a side hustle.\n\nIt’s not passive at the start, but once you’ve built a system, it’s one of the most automated income engines you can run. Set up AI agents that do the work for you. \n\nAnd now with SORA 2 it's just getting crazier. ",

But it solved the client’s problem (they just needed something live for a campaign). Don’t overthink polish in the beginning.\n\n2. Cold outreach &gt; waiting.\nAt first, I kept posting “looking for clients” ads and got nothing. What finally worked was sending personalized DMs/emails. I’d literally pick a small business, redesign a section of their homepage, and send it with a note: “This is how your site could look.”\n\n3. Use the right stack.\nI started with Framer templates, sometimes even Lovable. Later I hacked faster by combining an open-source starter (Frameable) with AI coding (Claude/ChatGPT). That mix let me deliver quickly without getting stuck when clients wanted small custom changes.\n\n4. Raise prices early.\nI was charging $300–500 for weeks of work. Dumb. Once I had a few sites in my portfolio, I started quoting $1,200+. Fewer clients, better margins, less burnout.\n\n\t\n5. Referrals snowball.\nMy first 3 clients all came from outreach. But by the time I had 6–7, new ones started showing up through word of mouth. That’s when things got way easier.\n\nI’m not claiming guru status. I just kept iterating until something clicked.",

          "body": "Let me give you my experience over the last 6 months.  \nI got really interested in starting, so I did all of my due diligence and research. I tried looking at locally used machines as well as some trusted domestic companies that sell new machines. Pricing was outrageous no matter the option, and everything looked very costly to start or difficult to upgrade used or damaged machines to cashless payments.\n\nI used my sourcing skills to find the exact same machines the domestic company was selling in Canada for 6.5k to 9k and instead had one imported at a 3.5k cost to my door.  \nIt took some time to set it up and have it shipped. I waited until about two weeks before delivery to secure a location. I went in person with a pitch and an info sheet. I tried six spots on the first day, and I don’t know if it was just luck or my networking skills, but I had all six locations wanting a machine placement. These were all prime, high traffic spots as well.\n\nI went with the location closest to me and told the others they’d have to wait (mainly while I figured out if this was even profitable or not). There were a bunch of logistical and troubleshooting aspects I had to learn. I spent two days with the machine at my work figuring out the Chinese instructions, getting a SIM card for the WiFi, setting it up online, getting all my stock items, understanding how to install the coils, and programming everything.\n\nThat first machine was netting me 1.1k in profit in the first month. About 15 days in, I could see I was selling roughly 20 units a day, making 30 to 50 dollars daily profit. I immediately ordered two more machines and was determined to scale.  \nNow it’s just get machines, place them, buy more machines.\n\nThey seem to pay themselves off within about 3.5 to 4 months. The biggest logistical struggle is the lead times. Between the factory preparing the order and my freight forwarding coordinating with my other business shipments, it’s about 40 to 65 days from ordering to receiving.\n\nI’ll be completely honest with you, the business runs itself. It’s extremely straightforward. The reason I think most people fail or can’t make this work is because they can’t source machines at a reasonable price and aren’t great at sales. I’ve seen so many people in this space looking for placement agents, sending email blasts, or cold calling people. That’s a weak strategy for placement.\n\nI went in person, dressed properly, to six high traffic, well scouted locations. I had answers ready for every question they could ask, either in my head or on the info sheet. I was friendly, confident, and sold my vending machine as a solution to a problem they didn’t even know existed. My biggest mistake was even offering a commission. The first location I negotiated a small split with the property manager because I thought I was supposed to. In reality, the other locations I spoke to didn’t even bring it up, nor should they care.",

In case you are equipped with a smartphone and internet, this is actually the right time to start, provided you are smart about it.\n\nStart learning skills that combine human creativity with AI tools. As an illustration, use ChatGPT or Claude to learn quires like copywriting, marketing, or scriptwriting. Practically you can do everything for free. After that, you can use applications such as CapCut or Canva to create content for small creators or local businesses. You can offer to edit their short videos, write captions, or come up with ideas, all from your phone.\n\nAI is not only taking away jobs but also creating new ones for those who understand it. The majority of creators do not have time to learn these tools, you can be the one who makes it easier for them. Discard the \"get rich quick\" apps, acquire a real skill with AI and use that to buy your first computer. That is how you get out for good.",

It’s small, but it feels like such a big deal to me, the idea that something I built once can now earn while I sleep is kind of surreal.\n\nHere’s the app if anyone’s curious:  \n[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexur.yumo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexur.yumo)\n\nIt’s nowhere near real passive income yet, but this tiny milestone reminded me that these things actually *start small*.\n\nWould love to hear how others here reached their first online income too.",

The PO showed up in my Payment History a few weeks ago and the status was ’Ready to be paid’. It stayed like that until yesterday when it changed to ’Payoneer payment is in progress’.\n\nI have a basic understanding of how the payments should work and I know the payments are usually between 10th and 20th, but a few hours ago, when I logged back in to my OneForma account to check my payment history, it has no data, it seems like it has been wiped.\n\nIs this an issue for everyone or just me? It was quite a big payment I was supposed to get, but after reading reviews, I have started to think that they are not quite legitimate.\n\nP.S. Nothing in my Payoneer account either, just to make it clear that I have not received the money.",

I can code pages, make creatives, and edit like hell — but I need the strategy and the fastest path to those first reliable commissions.\n\nBasically, it would be a great help for me if a PRO affiliate would take a few minutes and briefly lay out his approach.\n\nSo I want to ask you: what strategy would you take if you were me — with these skills but zero ad budget (for now) — to hit 2–3k/month?\n\nTo make replies easier, here are the constraints &amp; \"assets\":\n\n- 8 yrs ecommerce (I know funnels &amp; analytics)\n- I can make video + long reviews + edit fast - I have some doubts about putting my face on it, but ok, if I find an offer I can really believe in, let's do it\n- I can build landing pages\n- email is not my thing - but I'll learn that fast and build magnets to increase my DB\n- I have experience 8yrs of running ads (so I can scale later) but no ad budget now — must be organic, partnerships, barter, SEO, email, Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, etc.\n- I have no channels / communities of my own, I ONLY have a 200k email list (ecommerce products, maybe I can use them for something, but most of them are age 50+)\n- Based in Romania , Europe (that's important too I guess) I can create also for local people OR for international market - another BIG questions of mine\n\nWhat I’d love from the community:\n\n* Growth paths / approaches\n* Language approaches? (local / international market?) \n* Best offer types to chase first (recurring vs one-time? high AOV vs high conversion?)\n* Any quick templates? :D (DM script, hook examples, landing layout) you’d recommend\n* If you’re offering collab/mentorship/have a product that fits ... drop a reply or DM me.\n\nIf you can share your tactic, I think there are a lot of people in my position, and i think that this sub will become one of my new best buddies haha.. Let’s build something useful for everyone :D \n\n(Yes I used chatGPT to polish my post because english is not my first language and it helped me to structure the ideas for a better understanding)",

      "selftext": "We [managed to cross $1k MRR](https://x.com/onlinedopamine/status/1958544915966861629) with our startup 4.5 months into launching the product, so I wanted to use this post as a way to reflect on what has been working and what hasn't. \n\nQuick aside: this is the first time I ever had a SaaS that makes four digits. Launched 4 before (2 still active). Did all of this while working a regular full-time job. \n\nHere are all the marketing hacks that moved the needle:\n\n1. Build in public. \n\nYes, nothing revolutionary here. We're in the B2B space (or prosumer at the very least) and I do believe it helps if people know you. \n\nPersonally, I don't even publish that much about our startup (since there isn't something super exciting happening all the time) to not come off as salesy. Instead, just sharing tidbits about my life, things I find interesting, opinions I have, places I travel to, and so forth. \n\nJust be a normal human being and realize that post people, especially on social media, don't actually care much about your business (at least not to the extent they care about you as a person). \n\nPieter (Levels), I find, does this exceptionally well. Maybe every 5-6th of his posts is about a product of his and he mostly just talks about things he finds interesting. \n\n2. Case studies\n\nI wanted to mention this as a separate point, even though it's utilizing the same platforms (X and Threads). \n\nIn our case, I share successful slideshows other accounts publish on TikTok, detailing the copy they use, the products they promote, influencers they work with, and such. \n\nThis is the part where we deliberately target our ICP - and where we see the highest ROI in terms of conversions. \n\nIntuitively, that somewhat makes sense. Many in the app space, for example, are still somewhat unaware of the benefits of slideshows, so seeing successful examples (and how you can replicate them) is oftentimes all the inspiration you need to get started. \n\n3. Building what our competitors are missing\n\nThere's one competitor in our product category who sucks up most of the oxygen (since he was the first to launch a product in the category). \n\nHowever, his product is still missing tons of essential features. So, we simply built those (e.g., workspace &amp; team features) based on customer queries. \n\nAgain, this also ties back into point 1. Those prospective customers wouldn't have found us if it wasn't for building in public. And then we executed quickly once they did. \n\n4. Experiment with pricing\n\nWe initially started with a simple subscription like anyone does. However, what we soon realized talking to our users is that many don't want to pay for and use all of the features our product offers. \n\nAs a result, we introduced a credit-based system and split up our plans into four distinct tiers, with one plan only offering the most basic of features (so that customers can then top up with credits if they need access to any of the other features). \n\nAnd now some of our customers actually spend hundreds of $$$ just on credits while still being on the cheapest tier. \n\n5. Message your competitor's customers\n\nOur main competitor is pretty active on socials, so every time he'd post, we simply would send a message to all the people who replied. \n\nIt works really well if you take point 3 serious and can use those differentiating features as the baseline for your message (e.g., \"Hey, I saw that you use x, I work on y and we have the following features abc that you may find interesting). \n\nI feel like way too many indie hackers want to play nice, be liked, and don't step on anyone's toes. \n\nThis is a business you're trying to run after all, so be as brazen as you humanly can. \n\n6. YouTube\n\nIronically, as I am typing this, our YouTube channel just got banned lol. This one hurts because it had been converting super well, especially considering the still fairly low amount of views. \n\nThe simple reason is intent. We mostly did search-based videos (e.g., people looking for how to do xyz), which meant that intent is super high.\n\nThe great thing about search-based YouTube is that those videos also tend to rank for a long time (as people keep searching for that keyword). \n\nHopefully we can get our channel back because it was actually the acquisition channel I was excited the most for and spending a substantial amount of time on. \n\n  \n\\--- \n\nIf you guys have any questions, feel free to ask away :)  \n",

Hedge YouTube risk Appeal, but also mirror each tutorial to a backup channel and self-host. Make search-based videos map 1:1 to docs pages so you rank on web even if the video disappears.\n3. Make credits work harder Add usage meter plus 70 and 90 percent alerts, prepaid credit bundles with a small discount, optional auto-reload, and “team credit sharing” inside workspaces. This lifts ARPU without forcing plan upgrades.\n4. Steal share without drama For each competitor reply, record a sixty-second Loom that recreates their user’s current workflow in your tool and offers a white-glove migration slot. Keep it personal, one per day.\n5. Measure what moves revenue Track from first touch to purchase with outbound events, then review weekly: which posts, videos, and checklists start sessions that convert to paid and to credit top-ups.\n\nCongrats on the milestone.

I have 14 years of education in dog training, learning under multiple mentors. Many people have told me I need to write a book about my life and that I give great life advice because of what my medical conditions have put me through.  I feel a lot of people look up to me, though I strongly feel inadequate in that realm.  I want to blog about my journey to success.\n\nThe best thing is I have massive support to get through this, in the sense of, stable housing without needing to work, disability income (that I wish to work towards going off), and overall emotional support of my friends.  With that said, my goals are:\n\n* To build inspiration in others who are in my shoes or in similar situations.  Create guides on how to grow a business that works around their chronic illness(es).\n* Share my story in a book that encompasses life lessons I have learned along the way.\n* Eventually sell products (like t-shirts, buttons, patches) that bring awareness and possibly create a non-profit to help people in my shoes.\n* Start public speaking about my journey and how I conquered my medical conditions.\n* Eventually, **create my own dog training and boarding business** as that's my biggest passion (this has a huge startup cost, so I need a way to make the money)\n\nWith that said, my biggest setback is really just my medical conditions.  They are neurological, and after an injury, my brain struggles to learn information, but that's getting better.  I have struggled with the next steps after figuring out my goals, such as, what I need to learn to accomplish this and the basic steps to get started.  It all seems overwhelming, but I know once the ball gets rolling I will figure it all out.  My biggest inspiration is Temple Grandin. I am autistic and an extremely visual and hands on learner.\n\nAny advice, words of wisdom, or guidance would be much appreciated.",

You should expect that any time or money you spend on this business is going to be a net loss. So this is a gift to your wife to try and make her happy. From that viewpoint I recommend only helping her when she asks and making sure that you do not mess up your main business for this new business that will likely fail.

Although its starting point may seem easy and humorous, it demonstrates how to find potential user groups on very specific needs through data-driven business models and successfully convert them into profits. Firstly, the power of segmented markets: just like trust funds searching for investment opportunities with long-term stable returns, this website targets an extremely specific and off mainstream demand - to record and compare \"fart\" data. By creating a sufficiently refined product that can attract highly focused user groups (such as those interested in gut health) and increase user stickiness through additional features such as user generated content and food tracking, this is a market strategy with the potential for long-term stable growth.",

It appears the entire middle market got destroyed by AI slop and low efort podcasts and generally there is a fear of income loss for any production.\n\nCreators spend a ton on production and editing etc and they are losing views and engagement to AI shorts about women washing dishes in the olympics. 4 millions likes that short got. There are clients with 10m+ subs getting less than 100k views now. So, its clear, AI will kill jobs in code generation and content creation.\n\nWhat exactly is going to pay everyone's bills??? Id love to know how everyone else is handling this.\n\nedit: a lot of comments are underestimating the magnitude of this. These are not just random people that will be directly or indirectly affected. It will be fathers and mothers. Brothers and sisters. Sons and daughters. And to those that think they are immune to AI, like mechanics, when people lose their jobs/incomes, they typically dont keep 2-3 cars.\n\nedit: apparently China waited for the markets to close before telling DJT we aren't getting those gpus. In this game of high-stakes poker, DJT like to play his cards face-up.",

From Hollywood to YouTube to agencies, the creative industry is currently in transition and anyone claiming to have the answers as to where it ends up is completely full of shit. The biggest studios and brands in the world are all experiencing this reality while still investing millions into top talent to crack the code yet few are succeeding. With the rate of change, what works this week may not be relevant next week. Content creation is caught in one of the first waves of AI disruption. \n\nThis really isn’t OP’s fault, show some empathy. Many of you will have similar experiences in the near future as the AI wave disrupts more industries.\n\nOP, as someone who works in this industry providing b2b video services and owns a growing YouTube channel, a suggestion would be to target companies/creators with offline audiences. For example, I’m experiencing a similar situation but I’ve found some success partnering with organizations that host large in person events at convention centers. These days many events feature a video and in my experience, not many agencies or production companies are pursuing these projects. They don’t pay as well as commercials but they can help keep the lights on while we seek clarity for the future. \n\nBest of luck!",

But in this economy, with costs of labor going up, coupled with employer tax burdens, etc I wonder if businesses are turning more to affordable solutions like AI vs signing retainers and contracts with marketing/design firms.\n\nLike if I am running a business and am on a tight budget but need branding, marketing ideas, a logo, etc I probably can’t afford these $20k retainers some branding and design agencies want. I would totally turn to AI. \n\nWill AI get old, probably yes. But money talks and bullshit walks. If that’s all people can afford, then that’s it.",

          "body": "Creative always wins, but just like small to mid sized businesses not wanting to spend on creative for their marketing, it’s the same here.\n\nSo look to what creative agencies and post/production houses had to do when camera/lighting equipment (dslr’s, iPhone, LEDs) and post programs (consumer graphics , Adobe, etc.) became more affordable and accessible to the masses.   The ones that focused on talent and high end were successful and the scraps were left to small businesses to fight over.\n\nThe businesses that will be hurt the most are the average ones.  Crappy businesses who can cut costs and let quality suffer will drive prices down, sole proprietors who are super talented will survive and high end businesses will be able to thrive - while the average good intentioned company who’s not particularly great at anything that has employees will struggle.\n\nThese companies need to make the right choices to navigate this.  For many this means talent and process.  Finding talent early is hard but keeps cost down.  Investing in process cuts costs significantly because time is the biggest factor we can control to compete.\n\nIt’s not hopeless - it just another reminder that the cycles of change are speeding up.  30 years ago, there was certainty for longer stretches.  You might have one big change in your career.  Now it’s a big change every 5 years.  We always have to be learning - always questioning our models and always keeping expenses under control.",

Make use of this AI market, it's still early. Can you incorporate it into your workflow to get more done in a shorter time and therefore make your prices cheaper?

But yeah, we may have to automate processes to keep up with demand as well as the need to keep offering current news etc. Before a website existed to support a magazine. They kind of became parallel, creating interactions between the two doesn’t really work. The writing process is different in approach etc. So honestly no idea where this will leave the company.

The only thing I can imagine to save our jobs, in production especially, is to embrace AI and use it as a selling point. \n\nWe use AI to clean up audio and we'll tell prospective clients that, but we make sure they know that AI still can't do everything. It can't tell what every noise is and will try to turn background noise into conversation. It doesn't know what content is inappropriate for a specific platform. It can make a  fake of the hosts that we can use for minor corrections with enough training but it also can't mimic inflection correctly so it's not like it can just do a show for you. There's a lot it can do, but someone still needs to monitor it, fix things, and make sure the end result is a complete and cohesive production. So, for now at least, advertise that you use AI tools to help produce top tier work. \n\nI think the bigger problem is that people have gotten famous with trash video and garbage audio. Like stuff literally recorded on the phone. So now no one even tries to make something of quality.

He wanted to listen to my experience and my take on starting a business. The first thing I told him is that it is so difficult. His face changed immediately May be he was expecting some delightful words. He might have had a rosy picture that running a business is all jolly good. \n\nHe said I can find investors, there is a 3 PhD holders team, R&amp;D IP and what not. There is this one client who may pay for the product if they can build it spending 800k$. So on paper it’s just words and promises. I told him that a business should run not because there is funding, or employees are working hard, or there is a trend you can surf on. A business runs when there are customers who are willing to pay for what you sell. Simple. And that part is the hardest in an economically turbulent world. And when revenue doesn’t flow in, everything else becomes tough. I await invoices as small as 2000$ which were not paid by clients for months. I told him that you will be choked every month with no light at the end of the tunnel. May be I should have just lied to him it’s going to be awesome. May be I should have said more nice things but I had very few nice things to say. How would you describe your journey to an aspiring entrepreneur? Roses or thorns? Or a mix of both?",

I spent years trying to build \"revolutionary\" products from scratch, including this esports betting platform where we were basically inventing everything as we went. Massive headaches, tons of wasted time figuring out if anyone even wanted what we were building. Now when I look at markets, I do exactly what you did - find something that's already working but has obvious pain points. The AI model switching thing is such a perfect example because anyone who uses multiple models feels that frustration daily. What's brilliant about your execution is you didn't try to out-feature the big player, you went the opposite direction and made it cleaner. I see this all the time in mobile development where apps get bloated trying to serve everyone, then someone comes in with a focused version and steals a chunk of users who just wanted something simple. The AppSumo deal sounds promising too - those lifetime deals can be tricky for recurring revenue but they're great for getting that initial user base and feedback. The validation aspect you mentioned is huge, most entrepreneurs waste months building in a vacuum when they could be looking at existing solutions and thinking \"how can I make this better for a specific group of people\" instead of trying to reinvent everything.",

So, 4 years ago, I was on PP for one specific product line with c+business owners etc. \n\n\nIn jest one evening I mentioned that we discuss sunny part of plan, but we are not gaming (simulating, preparing) for dark scenario. \n\n\nPrompted, for next day I did small pres. I explained inherent limitation of our position: \n- wrong role divisions - backend architect having been given also partial frontend architect duty, frontend architect doing cloud design, different frontend team being at odds with backend architecf etc. Showed on cases where frontend solution is another API, different frontend end builds features and then await and modifying waiting for backend APIs to work. Shown on few stories.\n- obsolete codebase: core parts of code were not touched for way too long, causing atrophy and causing fear of change (I do not know what else will break), my proposal would be to invest in scheduled, phased rewrite into different language to boost our understanding and optimize interfaces. Shown on what was moved to backlog in previous PP.\n- changing market - customers are looking for more integrated solution than piece meal engine, shown on crying emails from field staff.\n\n\nAll of this could have been addressed via single program as it all comes down to knowledge and understanding. It is like at farm, sometimes you need to grow unpopular plant for your field to yield again.\n\n\nAnyway, none of this was sexy enough in Agile business owner scoring, everybody was voting based on who they knew, who lobbied the best. And they also complained about me trying to spoil the vibe. \n\n\nNow, all of above reduced market potential of that product line to close to zero.\n\n\nLook, emotionally, most people do not grow past middle school.",

I have been an entrepreneur for a significant part of my life, and I grew tired of working for myself, so I decided to go corporate. There was a reason for that.\n\nI ran my own very successful business, making a lot of money, but I had one problem: I realized that I didn't have the knowledge and training to take it to the next level, as I never attended school. \n\nI felt like I had become stagnant, as the competition was growing, and I was dealing with staff. It had become a large operation, where I now had to hire the right people, but I wasn't as knowledgeable in various areas, such as bookkeeping, management, inventory, and logistics. I started to struggle because I only knew what I knew. I didn't have to right people in my environment that could help me and only gave bad advice.\n\nI decided that I needed to learn but going to school wasn't an option since I needed to make money. So I came up with the bright idea to take a job that was in the line of what I was doing and my goal was to learn how the big boy did it. My goal was to do it for a year and go back on my own. Now I have been fulltime for over 10 years and started my own business on the side, which is still in the start up phase however, it was the best decision I ever made.\n\nMy entrepreneurial experience has taught me to be very successful and rise to the top in the business world because I was thinking as a business owner and not like an employee. I learned everything from product management, project management, engineering, marketing, finance, all the missing pieces in real life\n\nI enjoyed that my money was in my account every 2 weeks, regardless if I took a vacation, was sick or even if I didn't feel like working for a few days. My money was coming.\n\nWhere it changed is that my entrepreneurial spirit knew when it was time to get back out on my own and build something, but this time I totally understood everything that I didn't before, and my new business is becoming much more of what I always wanted it to be because now I have a real foundation.\n\nSo I always knew I never meant to work for someone, but I also realized that just because that's what I wanted I wasn't close to ready and figure out how to make it work so I could be successful and that meant becoming a \"slave\" to better understand it.",

That is not to say they are all fakers, but I think it is upwards of 95% among people under 25.\n\nAlso, as someone who has spent the majority of my career as the youngest in the room, an extra 15 years of life is a huge advantage in terms of knowledge and experience. Obviously, in the business context, that only applies to people who are in high positions\\*; the typical employees know almost nothing about running a corporation.\n\n\\*I define this as C-Suite or, if the company has over 1000 employees, one level beneath the C-Suite.",

If havent made it by then very unlikely you’ll make it later than that.

The second - most people don't realize how much a better UX and UI can make their product much more popular, and as OpenAI is often focused on building the infra, they forget/don't care that much about the aspect of things.

How many other small or larger firms are in your space? Is it the same thing but a little better, cheaper to use, does yours do a better job of integrating with other software/llms/etc?\n\nLarger point - this is going to be a big market in general. But to capture a decent chunk of that market you have to ask what gives us an edge? People walk away from better tech all the time for stuff that does the basics they really need for less. Or some make have a better application, but that may not fit into the common ecosystems business have adopted. Lots of answers come with time. You might think one thing and 6 months later have to pivot. Be flexible, but try and make sure you have a North Star. \n\nUsing a non-tech example. Look at a business like chicfila or canes. They both have a niche and work in the same space. But both succeed because they are different enough and yet both good at what they do. \n\nOne hits you with high personal touch, strong customer service, repeatable food quality. They have a mixture of chicken products to choose from. The other really does one thing. Sell chicken tenders - but it’s repeatable and people like them. Your only need as a customer is to know if you want 3,4,6 etc tenders. That’s it. \n\nThe better you get at figuring out your target customer or vision for what makes your agent valuable.

That voice saying \"you're a fraud, they're going to find you out.\" So I did what you're supposed to do: I worked harder. I over-delivered. I said yes to every client. I hired people to fill the gaps I was scared to admit I had. I chased the next win, thinking it would finally make me feel legitimate.\n\nAnd you know what happened? I became the \"successful\" CEO of a company I absolutely hated. I finally understood the real cost of imposter syndrome. It's not the anxiety. It's the life you build to try and quiet the anxiety. I was so busy trying to prove I was good enough that I built a business that had nothing to do with who I actually am.\n\nThe fix was realizing I had tied my worth to external outcomes (stuff I can't fully control) instead of my personal qualities, which I always can.\n\nOutcomes might get people in the door, but they rarely make people stay. What makes them stay is the real stuff: your integrity, your insight, how you handle a crisis.\n\nFor me, when I made that shift, sales calls stopped being high-stakes performances. They became simple alignment checks: \"Are we a true fit for each other?\" The pressure to \"beat\" competitors vanished. No one can compete with who you *are* at your core. They can only compete on the commoditized outcomes.\n\nJust wanted to put this out there in case anyone else is building a prison and mistaking it for a legacy.\n\n  \n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*: Let me clarify the one thing I didn't make clear.\n\nThat \"prison\" business? I left it behind. I didn't fix it. I walked the fuck away and built something new from scratch (after a break). The new thing is the exact opposite: it runs on a different scale I mentioned above. I only do work that aligns with who I am. And the interesting part is that it's more profitable. \n\nI guess my original point got missed: this wasn't so much about work-life balance.. more about building a business that was literally designed by my insecurities. The workaholism was a symptom of building an entire life around proving I wasn't a fraud.\n\nHope that clears things up a bit. ",

          "body": "I had a similar experience working as an employee.  I have a degree in photography and 20 years experience in audio / video work.  I signed up to be the \"Creative Director\" for a medium size reseller (privately owned).  The owner / boss had hired consultants.  Consultants told him he needed \"social media presence.\"  \n\nEssentially, my job as creative director was 3 fold.  He wanted someone to run his social media channels, create commercial video content, and design and manage a multi-camera live-streaming classroom (that would produce social media content).  \n\nI was new to social media and live-streaming so I offered to train for the position at $25 / hr with the understanding that once I was \"up to speed\" I wanted to negotiate my actual starting salary.  We discussed this as a \"test drive\" to see if I fit in the position.  \n\n6 months in I had designed a single operator 4 camera live-streaming classroom studio, and also created the first examples and pipeline to make commercial videos for his 150+ products at the speed of 1-2 videos / wk.  Social media posting and managing was just around the corner.  I have tons of customer service experience so I was confident about managing social media.  I had excelled in this position as creative director.  \n\nWe had a sit down and I presented my salary proposal asking for just above the zip recruiter average for my area (Creative Director - title on my contract).  $125,000 / yr.  \n\nHe simply replied with \"my answer to your request is no.\"   Building the live-streaming classroom studio has been delayed to \"maybe\" sometime in 2026 and the social media push is \"on hold.\"  \n\nHe offered for me to continue working creating commercial videos at the rate of $25 / hr with a small wage increase \"likely upon review\" at the 1 year mark.  \n\nI provide physical studio real estate, having to shoot video of his machines in the largest room of my house.  These often can't be moved or pushed to the side - ever.  It's a dedicated 12' x 25' space.  Plus, I provide for use to the company $20,000 + in video studio equipment, that often requires updating or replacing.  \n\nAfter tax take home was $36k / yr.  Deducting $6k / yr for real estate space and $6k / yr for studio equipment upkeep.  Actual take home pay after considering resources I was required to provide to retain employment was $24,000 / yr.  \n\nBoss, say well I didn't sign up to buy or pay for \"your\" studio.  Adding that $50k / yr was more than fair for someone starting out making videos.\n\nI gave him back the same \"no\" that he gave me and carefully dropped off all of his machines and property the next day.  \n\nI hadn't felt that good in years.   Maybe you could call it a shifting landscape or a change in business plans, but to me it felt like a massive bait and switch.  Boss had shown his hand.  It was a 10 year ladder to an average salary.  I had walked right into his prison.\n\n  \nI wrote this as the OP's story resonated with me.   I was working full-time, stressing myself out, going above and beyond to prove that I could do 3-4 people's positions maybe to try to silence my own imposter syndrome as there were new elements to this position.  I've never worked so hard and had the \"reward\" swept out from under me at the last minute.   \n\n$25 / hr and having to sacrifice my peace at home + expensive equipment upkeep would had been a prison the entire time.  I spent most of my salary upgrading equipment for his purposes and then I was working for what?  New equipment that \"I\" didn't actually need.   \n\nI'm back to working on my own projects and forming my own companies.  The paychecks are not always steady, but somehow working on my own time for my own goals feels more like breathing air than having to clock into prison.",

But the right one, at the right time, with the right intent, is equity in its purest form. And lately, that is what is being stripped from real founders.\n\nI have seen this too often.\nA founder pitches to investors, gets rejected, and six months later, the same concept surfaces from a portfolio company, repackaged with funding.\nNon-disclosure agreements are mocked. Validation is dismissed. “Execution” becomes the shield that justifies imitation.\n\nMeanwhile, pseudo-founders parade around with thin-air equity, pseudo-investors hunt safe vanity bets, and pseudo-VCs gamble other people’s money to climb prestige ladders.\n\nIt is not startups versus corporates anymore. It is authentic creation versus systemic mimicry.\n\nThose who actually build from scratch, with sleepless nights, borrowed laptops, and insane conviction, are not just executing. They are imagining.\n\nExecution is a skill.\nVision is a gift.\nBoth are currency. But one is disappearing from circulation.\n\nDo you think ideas are still undervalued, or have founders stopped defending them?",

These events attract very interesting people - technical, creative, entrepreneurial, industry experts - you name it. \n\nAt each of these events, I typically hear **40 to 50 business idea pitches** on the first night, then watch around 10 teams of 4-5 people attempt to do customer discovery, build MVPs, and variously execute on these ideas, then finally deliver investor style pitches to panels of judges. Are you doing the math? That's a decent sample size of founders and ideas. \n\nSome of them don't get very far during a single weekend; others finish with functional products and even sales. But most of them at least get through 1 or 2 rounds of customer discovery with real humans (no silly online surveys). And that's where ideas meet the market and real learning begins. That's where founders learn to let go of their \"idea\" for a solution and discover how other people experience the problem they think they're solving. 99% of the time they discover they had made significant false assumptions and their \"idea\" must change or it's unlikely to reliably find paying customers. \n\nIt's their investigation of the problem that surfaces insights into solution ideas and that's where value creation begins to form.\n\nWanna know what I've observed about ideas? \n\nI see the same ideas over and over and over. I've literally listened to thousands of idea pitches, and it's now extremely rare that I hear a new idea. It's fairly common for Startup Weekend attendees to be nervous about sharing their idea. Sometimes they take me aside and tell me about their idea, and why they're afraid someone will steal it. Then I proceed to tell them about several other teams that I've worked with on the same idea, and the things they've learned, what worked and didn't, and it's easy to show them that the best thing they could possibly do is to talk about their idea with a variety of people and try to build a team. \n\n**The team is far more important** than the idea.  \nWith a great team, the idea can change and you'll be able to execute. A great idea is worthless if you don't have a team, or have a bad team. The best way to find great team members is to talk to lots of people about the problem you want to solve and get some awesome people involved. You can't do that by hiding your idea. \n\n**Your idea is not unique.**  \nLook up \"multiple discovery\" or \"simultaneous invention\" and understand that for every idea we have there are hundreds of innovative people around the world having the same idea. As technology and society evolve, all of our creative minds are working on the same problems, with the same tools and limitations. Old problems get solved and create new ones. New problems arise from new circumstances. You're not the only one who noticed. The things that will differentiate between all of the innovators are not the idea itself, but their skills, flexibility, connections, access to resources, etc. \n\nBut... but... you can't find your idea online? You did some Google searches? LOL That's because the other folks working on it have either failed and their stuff isn't online any more, or they've done such a poor job describing it so far that it's hard to search for, or they're working in a different language, and you only searched in English, or they're like you: hiding. But I promise you it's not because your idea is unique. \n\nNow I can tell a hundred stories about people who boldly pitched their idea to a room full of a hundred strangers, formed a team, fell in love with the process, and built a successful company. The people who were too scared to share their idea? ...I never heard of them again.\n\n**Execution Starts with Discovery**  \nPeople love quotes like \"ideas are a dime a dozen...\" but this leaves out something critical. The really important thing is to learn what good execution looks like. It begins by genuinely investigating the problem with real humans, using a method like Steve Blank's Customer Development, or Rob Fitzpatrick's Mom Test. \n\nSo here's a more complete quote, from **Sam Altman**:  \n\n&gt;_\"Ideas themselves are not worth anything,_  \n&gt;_only executing well is what creates value._  \n&gt;_Execution gets divided into two key questions:_  \n&gt;_1. Can you figure out what to do?_  \n&gt;_2. Can you get it done?_\"",

My startup failed spectacularly because I never properly validated the problem I thought I was solving.

Every successful company I've helped has pivoted at least once from their original vision because they discovered what customers actually wanted versus what they thought they wanted.\n\nThe founders who succeed aren't the ones with the best ideas, they're the ones who can stomach being wrong over and over until they find something that works.",

There are very few ideas that are absolutely brand new and have \\*never\\* been imagined, thought about, or expressed before. \n\nExecution IS EVERYTHING.   \n  \nA world-class, first-rate idea will sit on a shelf and gather dust because the execution was poor, while a third-rate idea will pull in billions because of stellar execution.\n\nMicrosoft had the idea for the iPad / iPhone years before Steve Jobs ever thought about it. In fact he stole the idea from them and he simply executed better at it than Microsoft could dream of.  \n  \nAll the big defense contractors arguably had plenty of ideas that Musk had, but he was just damn better than them in execution. \n\nI've worked with plenty of VCs and PEs in my 27 years of work in technology and I can tell you - founders who think they're the next Jesus are boringly common, and they all get wiped into obsolescence by a no-name who has a better story and who works with a professional team that executes better. \n\nWhat's your GTM model? What's your pricing structure? How did you prove the value of the assets you supply? How are you closing the gap against your competitors AND building a defensible moat? What experience do you have in executing legal and contractual details? Show me you have liquid cashflow, not peanut butter. How are you going to execute on sales &amp; marketing? How are you executing on supply chain and procurement risks? How are you building consistently great CX? How and where are you uncovering, analyzing, and hiring the talent to do all this in a way that is commercially sustainable? How are you envisioning, developing, financing, and executing on a long-term roadmap that tells me you're not a one-trick pony? \n\nI could write a damn book on this.",

Here are mostly all the ones we pay for\n\n1. ChatGPT: Everyone in the team gets ChatGPT paid version, which helps us summarize, generate reports, and what not\n2. Windsurf/Cursor: Everyone in our team gets either Windsurf or Cursor, which has literally tripled our developer output. We ship products much faster now. Personally I am huge fan of Windsurf Cascade agent that as been able to pull off large changes to our production app from a single prompt! But some prefer Cursor!\n3. Google Nano Banana: This is a new addition but it is crazy how it can make edits to images by keeping certain things same accurate. For example, it can turn a simple product image into full blown professional photoshoot with models etc. It can change color of your products etc. Must have for marketing imo!\n4. Frizerly: Their AI agent can learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website helping us improve our Google ranking. Saves me and my team 10+ hours every week! \n5. Bolt: Our marketing team now quickly spins up landing pages, lead gens using Bolt instead of having to wait for engineering or external contractors. It's not great complex apps for SAAS etc but it's great for marketing landing pages, and simple stuff!\n6. Intercom Fin: We had an issue where whatever we do and document on our website, people kept asking some obvious questions on chat taking up valuable support bandwidth. Now Fin can auto resolve these questions instantly. Other questions get auto routed to real people so that people are not mad as well!\n\nAnd that's about it I guess!",

Beyond the more than apparent hallucinations that GPT-5 web searches tends to have, I prefer to separate my scattered searches from ChatGPT's memory context. Doing so leads to more coherent responses and better memory recall on ChatGPT's part.\n4. Claude: One word. Projects. You can attach folders from your Google Drive, and Pro Tip: files added to Claude Projects update in real time. ChatGPT's projects only download the state of a file at the time its uploaded. I'll regularly tweak my drafts in Google Docs and come back to my main Project and instantly ask Claude for new feedback. It's amazing. \n5.

Running a startup in 2025 feels like herding a bunch of smart but quirky AI assistants instead of a human team, and I've been deep in that chaos for the last year with my own side hustle. My go-to stack right now is Notion AI for brainstorming and organizing everything from product roadmaps to daily tasks it's saved me hours on summaries and drafts paired with Zapier to automate the grunt work like syncing leads from my website to CRM and firing off personalized emails without me lifting a finger.  \n For content and marketing, Jasper has been a game-changer for quick blog outlines and social copy that actually converts, but honestly, some of the early hype around tools like those flashy AI video generators turned out to be mostly smoke; they spit out generic stuff that needed heavy editing anyway. Drift's chatbot has been solid for initial customer chats though, qualifying leads 24/7 so I don't miss out on weekends. What's in your mix that's actually sticking, or have you ditched any big-name ones that underdelivered?",

      "selftext": "I spent 30 years building my healthcare media business before selling it to private equity in 2021. But before my successful exit, I failed to sell it four times.\n\n**The two biggest mistakes I made:**\n\n1. **Believing you need $10M+ in topline revenue before anyone will take you seriously** \\- This bad advice kept me from getting professional help early on in my selling journey. It also delayed my timing and kept me pointed at a north star that wasn't even true. There are hundreds of quality lower and middle-market M&amp;A firms and brokers who work with businesses well below $10M but with strong EBITDA.\n2. **Trying to manage the sale process myself** \\- I thought I could handle it since I'd built the business and we were small enough. Huge mistake. It's a massive time suck trying to sell, and managing that while growing or maintaining the business is virtually impossible.\n\n**What I found success in:**\n\nHaving someone in my corner who is an expert in the field, has past M&amp;A experience, and follows a proven process makes all the difference. Whether that's an investment bank, M&amp;A advisor, or quality broker depends on your size and situation, but trying to DIY your exit is a recipe for disaster in my opinion.\n\nAfter my deal closed, I stayed on as CEO, growing the business further, and then have spent my last three years sharing my exit journey with other owners who are trying or thinking about selling. I kept seeing many of the same patterns, all are strong business operators, but many are underprepared for selling, getting bad advice, or lacking clarity on what actually drives a successful sale.\n\n**Questions for other business owners:**\n\n* Do you subscribe to the age-old motto that all businesses are built to be sold? Is your dream to successfully exit your business or do you have other plans?\n* If you want to sell, what are the biggest factors standing in your way?\n* If you've sold a business before, what surprised you most about the process?\n* What's the worst advice you've heard about selling a business?\n\nHappy to share more about what worked (and what didn't) in my experience, but for now curious on all your thoughts. Thanks in advance!",

          "body": "Here is what I can share / can answer about the failed selling attempts, and what it's led to.\n\nOn the first occasion it was a public company and they did some initial due diligence and within two weeks realized that our finances were a mess. We were still doing our finances ourselves, as opposed to having a CFO or a proper finance person do them in-house, which as you suspect is immediately what I hired after going through the initial process.\n\nOn the second failed attempt, I got to the altar, literally the day of closing, and the buyer came back and said that their investment committee had changed their minds. This was after five months of due diligence by the way. That one really hurt.\n\nThe other two occasions, I got approached by public companies directly and started negotiations, but realized that negotiation on my own behalf was a loser's game. I had no leverage and couldn't play hardball and was going to end up with a low offer so I backed out.\n\nCan't share exact multiples, but the final deal was with a PE firm, and was a solid lower middle-market transaction. Fortunately large majority was cash at closing with a small retained equity %, and a small earn-out component tied to growth over the time I stayed on as CEO.\n\nNowadays, I'm working with my son on ExitClarity, an exit readiness platform for business owners considering a sale. My mission really is to try to help others avoid all the mistakes that I made when trying to exit, and if I can do that, maybe it'll feel a little bit like it was worth it taking all those lumps haha.",

          "body": "I just sold my company after 26 years and 2 failed attempts. \n\nMy plan was to grow my company through acquisitions.  That is much harder than you think. After 2 solid years of trying to buy other companies,  I decided I needed an equity partner. \n\nIn the last 4 years, I have been approached at least 3 times per week by brokers, PE. And strategic buyers. I had no intention of selling. Then,  I started talking to them. I was offered an LOI  by a strategic that I really liked for a fair amount of money. I didn't really want to go that route so I declined after a lot of negotiations and soul searching.\n\n I was then approached by a holding company that offered me a platform position. Dream come true, right? They offered me great money, but during the negotiations, they kept changing the deal to the point that we both decided to walk away. \n\nThe M&amp;A advisor from the buyers' side then called me up and said they felt that my company was stronger than the offers I was getting, and they wanted to represent me. We came to an agreement, and they put me in front of 6 different buyers. PE, strategic, and a few other types. \n\nI just sold to my dream buyer. Great track record for growth. I named the terms of the deal and got a high multiple.  They are great to work with, and we are in full acquisition mode as a platform. \n\nIt took many years of building the company I would want to buy, but it paid off. The advice OP is giving is right on. Get an advisor, an M&amp;A CPA, and a good attorney.  You need a quality team. Your CPA will also need to advise you on tax consequences.

I need to reach a certain point of success first - otherwise, it wouldn’t feel like the right time to exit.\n\nWhat makes selling hard right now is the amount of opportunity everywhere. There are so many directions you could go, and it’s easy to spread yourself too thin instead of doubling down on one clear sales channel. That’s been the toughest part for me.\n\nThe best advice I’ve heard about selling a business is this: sell sooner than when things start heating up in your industry. When everyone’s chasing the same wave, it’s already too late.\n\nI have one question. How early do you think founders should start preparing for an exit?

In my area it could easily do far more what it does now in events. It has a unique track record though, especially since I acquired it in January of 2021, and the previous owner was ill for several years prior to that, so it was flying by the seat of its pants for quite some time. I happily have a large scale corporate agent who has watched me rebuild it and has a high interest in a strategic partnership. I have another entertainment business (physical with a growing digital component) that I have spent 20+ years building that has global potential, and I would much rather focus on developing that for the next 3-5 years, so this would be a great way for me to work on that with some financial security behind me. But I am learning all this as I go!  The tips for the team to hire in this thread were immediately valuable.\n\n My questions are: How do I start thinking in terms of negotiating value of items, intellectual property compensation, or salaries or pay for team members? I know with this partnership it would be an immediate value addition to their bottom line, and I don't want to sell myself short. They already have trucks, warehouse space, and an administrative team we would integrate into. Without even trying this business easily does 60 events per year and could do 10x that if it had the resources (as demonstrated by a long established competitor) and someone (not me) who thrives on a higher level of activity. I will be bringing them hundreds of new talent members, a whole set of equipment that is ready to make money, a growing client base with dozens of repeat clients, multiple formulas for multiple markets, plus a business name that has been around for over 20 years with a 5 star reputation. Of course there is so much more to the story, but those are the most salient points I can think of to start.\n\nThere was one year where we did over 100 events and still could have booked more, but that was the year I learned what the term \"uncontrolled growth\" meant and I immediately set about controlling it. We grossed $250,000 that year, but this is a VERY people dependent business so that came with a lot of headaches from other people. So I decided I would only do what I knew I could handle with a small trusted crew. We still are easily into six figures, but it operates on a boutique family level at the moment. Various family members lend skill and expertise and it contributes a form of support at the moment for all of us involved. Those family members ideally would be integrated into the partnership to help the transition over the next couple years. \n\nThat was a lot, but things are moving fast (as they always do) so any input is welcome! And if this was just a casual read for anyone, thank you for making it this far!",

      "selftext": "Im 34 years old with a Mechanical engineering degree. I have been in corporate world since 2017 mainly in manufacturing, maintenance and facility engineering, and management experience. Ive done really cool things and built a pretty solid resume. Money has been great but im generally burned out. I several years back that I don't get fulfillment out of working for others but I stayed in the trap. I have my first child otw and I decided to leave a extremely well paying job with great benefits due to a horrible culture which honestly was turning into the worst version of myself. Hind sight, I believe i should have stayed at least until the baby was born and took my paternity leave but i figured if i didnt leave i probably never would. After i left in july, I started my own facilities and equipment consulting business. Ive been struggling on how to get things started even though I have the llc, website, business cards etc. I also dont really know how to sale, if that makes sense. I feel like im losing the fire thats in me that makes me, me. I believe i also have too much ego and pride that has been holding me back for the majority of my life, which i take full responsibility for. The burnout and loss of confidence honestly is tearing me apart as I have a pregnant wife and baby due in 3 weeks. We have a decent nest egg of savings but its tearing me apart as a man. How do I get the drive back and push through to do the one thing ive been wanting to do for years, which is have a business and work for myself. I understand there will be stress in any environment and im willing to grind through, no stranger to hard work. Has anyone experienced this and successfully started there business? Any advice is greatly appreciated. \n\nAlso to add, about 4 years ago we relocated to atlanta for my job and isolated our selves from all friends and family. I didnt realize how much of an impact it would have on me not being social and not having a team in your corner rooting for you. Again, this is all on me and having something to prove to myself at the time. My goal now is to be a good father, husband,  and to have fulfillment in my life with whatever job or business I do.",

Somewhere here you wrote that you set ego aside. I call this “killing the ego,” and this is one of the most important things for building a business, because when ego guides you, you risk missing out on very attractive opportunities that could hurt your ego. So you've already taken an important step toward your venture.\n\nSecond thought about focus. Someone here already wrote that you try to solve a lot of problems. It's okay, but you really should focus on only one thing. It seems your family, because the main purpose is to be a good father and husband. Leave all the other stuff for a couple of months, spend more time with your wife and after birth with both of them. I assume she understands your mood and worries the same as you. Your business will still be there, especially as I understand you have some resources to not work for a while. Let this time with your family be your reset",

So I started reading, watching videos, and just trying to figure things out. And there’s one sentence I keep seeing everywhere, and it obviously makes sense: “Do something you’re good at.”\n\nThe problem is: I don’t really have any skills. There’s nothing I’d say I’m genuinely good at. I’ve always been the type of person who gets fascinated by many things, but because of that, I never truly committed to one. I’ve always stayed “average” at different things, but never became great at any of them.\n\nSo, unlike a lot of people who’ve spent years mastering something they love, I’m in my mid 20s and I have nothing. And honestly, it pressures me a lot. Seeing people around me who have clear skills or passions they’ve worked on for years, it makes me feel behind.\n\nEven when I ask myself, “What do you actually enjoy doing? What could you focus on now?” I don’t have a clear answer. I like many things, but not in a way that makes one stand out above the rest.\n\nRight now, I just feel lost. How do I start? How do I find something that I can genuinely put work and passion into something I can improve in and eventually become good, maybe even professional at?",

I have had many conversations with people about this topic, and even professionals with decades of experience underestimate their abilities. Sit down and make a list of all of the tasks you perform/skills you use in your current and past jobs. Nothing is too small or insignificant. Then list all of the things you enjoy spending time doing. Set a goal of adding at least 30-40 skills or experiences on that list. Take a day or two, then return to the list with a clear mind and start looking for connections between various skills/tasks. \n\nI call this the \"recipe card\" or \"index card\" exercise, because I will sit down with a box of index cards and a sharpie marker, and I use one card for every skill, or task, or business idea.

So instead of trying to pick the perfect niche, I started learning the skills, branding, marketing, how online business actually works. The more I learned and stayed in the space, the clearer it got. I started seeing patterns, problems people had, questions they kept asking and that’s where I found my gap. That’s what I ended up building around.

First year hit $120k purely from contracts, then scaled to $500k the next year (though half of that was me being the talent). Year three we crossed $1M and sold to a GSI.\n\n*Here's what nobody tells you*: the \"no upfront capital\" thing is technically true but spiritually a lie. You're converting time into revenue at minimum wage rates while working 80+ hour weeks. Your capital is your sanity, and you're spending it recklessly.\n\nThe actual path? Services. Always services. Freelance consulting, web dev, content creation.. anything where you can invoice within 30 days. Products and SaaS bleed cash for months before you see a dime. With services, you're cashflow positive in weeks, then you can funnel that into something scalable.\n\nPlatforms like Upwork or Fiverr take a commission, but they're essentially free lead generation. Build credibility there, then migrate clients off-platform once you've proven you're not incompetent. After about 6 months of this grind, you'll have enough revenue to justify a proper business structure and start hiring.\n\nReal talk though.. if you're worried about phone charging costs, you're not ready. The barrier isn't capital, it's the ability to tolerate prolonged financial discomfort while building something. Most \"zero capital\" success stories are actually \"I lived off savings/a spouse/ramen for 18 months\" stories with better PR.",

Everyone does that.   Not play games, but waste time. Its part of having a job.  But bosses are obsessed about time and not tasks.   25 years ago I was a service manager at a car dealership. The owner insisted everyone clock out at 5pm. Not early.  So during the last 15 minutes of the day people would just stand in a line by the time clock, waiting until exactly 5pm.  So much money wasted. And time.  I've noticed that bosses care more about employees being unhappy that actually getting work done.   I also spent time as a buyer for a company. I could have layed in bed at home and called the places and did the work. Would have been more effective most likely. But I had to go into work, sit at a desk, wear a suit even though nobody from the public was ever in our building, and make calls there.  Half the day I was just sitting there waiting on hold or waiting to make a call.  \n\nThe biggest thing is the person being late or calling off.  That drives me crazy.   Employees that show up are super valuable.   I've ignored employees stealing thousands of dollars from me just because they actually showed up each day and never called off lol. \n\nI'm going to assume you are a new business owner since you are asking these questions.

          "body": "My parents co-owned a small business and worked together for 30+ years. During that time, they hired a senior manager named Phil. Phil had broad responsibilities, including purchasing inventory. Over the years, it became clear to them that Phil had deals with some of the vendors for kickbacks paid to him and some other shady dealings. Basically, they knew that Phil was stealing 1-2% of what he was purchasing, which amounted to $100k+ per year.\n\nMy dad told me this, and I (naturally!) asked why he didn't fire Phil on the spot. His reply was a business lesson that stuck with me over the decades since.\n\n\"I could let him go, of course. But I prefer to look at that 1-2% as part of the cost of doing business. Sure, Phil costs the company money with his theft, but he is also so fiercely protective of his grift that he makes sure we get a good deal anyway, so we won't suspect him. Plus, he watches all the other employees like a hawk to ensure they're not skimming, so we won't get suspicious. This way, your mom and I can take a two week vacation if we want to, and we know it costs 1-2%. We can stomach that, and it's worth it for us. Is it right? No. But it's practical.\"\n\nSo, ask yourself - if this employee came to you and said, \"I'll keep doing a great job, but I'm going to steal $100/month worth of time and supplies. Is that OK?\" What would you say? If you'd agree to keep this person, then just pretend that conversation happened and move on. It costs a lot more to find, train, and keep another manager.\n\nIs it right to let this guy steal $10 worth of supplies? Or 40 minutes worth of time? No. But perhaps it's practical.",

I moved to a new city last year and in my old city there was a big scene for marketers with meetups and conferences every week, so I wanted to start something similar here. \n\nI spent $100 on the venue, $100+ on catering, spent money on flyers, and spent a lot of time making the presentation I was going to give, hanging up flyers at dozens of local businesses, meeting business owners, and promoting on meetup.com, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. Several people RSVP'd and I had close to 50 people interested or saying they would come including my friends. I promoted the event with my small team every day for 5 weeks sending reminders just enough to not be annoying. \n\nI got there and set everything up and... nothing. No one came. One person had been asking me questions on meetup named Curtis and I saw one person there who looked like him so I went up to say hello and introduced myself and he looked at me strange and said his name was Shawn and it was nice to meet me. SO AWKWARD. I casually played it off and left him alone, then waited 30+ minutes after the start time by the front door of the venue like some kind of 1970's breakup song to see if anyone would show before packing up my stuff and going home. \n\nNext month I was planning a follow up and was going to have a guest speaker come out, but now I'm thinking of emailing him (a respected name in my field) and canceling next month because it would embarrass me even more. \n\nMaybe Thursday nights aren't good? Maybe 6:30pm is a bad time for a business event? Maybe my offer wasn't good enough? Maybe something else was going on last night that I didn't know about? Maybe I should have tried paid ads on the radio or Facebook instead? Maybe I should try changing it to Saturday and pay a big name to appear? Maybe this town isn't interested in marketing and I need to try the big city 30 minutes away?\n\nI guess I'm just venting into the void here. I used to be in bands and I've definitely played shows where no one came, so this is nothing new, but it's never fun to go through it. \n\n\n\nI realize I'm not good at in-person event promotion and need to keep trying things until I make progress.",

If you make it 5-7, people can drift in and out. Some people can leave work early, some will show up late, and people can come and go as they please.\n\n\n- I need to stress this needs to be an opportunity for the networkers to meet new people and expand into new markets. The main attraction needs to be the attendees. All the successful independent networking events I go to do this. The host NEVER spends time peddling their own product; they go mingle and build relationships just like everyone else has to. Don't worry, people will remember you and that you hosted the events.\n\n\n- See if you can find a venue you can pay for where drinks are available. A slower night at a restaurant with a bar or something. Buy some appetizers but tell everyone to support your host and buy a drink! Give the venue host a minute to speak if they want.\n\n- As you grow ask if people have swag or door prizes to donate. Put business cards in a bowl for drawings (must be present to win, keeps some people there longer). \"We have a gift card here for a free 30 minute massage from Queen Spa.\" \"Up next is a branded tumbler from Reddit Bank and trust!\" \"A floral arrangement made by Flowers Unlimited, donated as a prize from Care Today Urgent Care. Thank you Care Today for this lovely prize. Let's see who's taking it home!\"\n\nTL;DR: no speakers, make it easy to come and go, find a venue (and give the venue an opportunity to make money aka the bar, also buy some appetizers), and focus is on the people attending. This is for them and about them.\n\nP.S. take this with a grain of salt I am tall, white, and handsome. Sample size of 1 and a lot of those factors probably play more into that than my actual ability.\n\nP.P.S. I'm not saying I'm handsome as a brag. I just realized its a factor, and I found out because when my wife goes with me to networking events, she extends her hand to shake the hand of EVERY SINGLE OTHER WOMAN that approaches us at light speed. \"Hi I'm xxx, Hailhydra's wife. Nice to meet you.\" Before she did this, other women ive known a long time through networking would come up and we'd give each other a hug. She put a stop to that quick lol.\n\nP.P.P.S my mom said I was handsome too. So sample size of...2?",

A group for helping each other.”  Or something like that. And then go every week or every other week consistently. The more your group is up the more people will come. But it takes time.

I think you had an excellent idea, but maybe you were too eager to do an in-person meet-up before trying to establish a network and community.\n\nI know it's difficult to find work right now. I'm a freelance developer who works on contract, and this is the first year I've had difficulty finding clients in... well, since the 2008 crash. \n\nThe first thing I would do is split up finding people to hire, and finding new clients. These are two separate things to tackle. \n\nMeetups for fellow developers and potential hires are going to be a lot easier to accomplish in my opinion, and those can be done online; because in our industry, pretty much everything can be done remotely. \n\nIf you really want to build a solid in-person event, I think you really need to have an established client list. Invite them to thank them for their business, and ask them to bring other community members.\n\nIf you're good, in this economy, at finding new clients and new work, you will absolutely figure this out.

          "body": "I’ve done these sorts of business development activities before and have had some level of success making it a casual meetup style event at a bar or restaurant. I’ve also run local tech meetup groups for about 30 years on and off.\n\nThere is a brewpub place near me that has a few pool tables, shuffleboard table, foosball, and decent “standing around space”. I’ve had a few meetups there with mixed success. But I never reserve the space and I don’t cater it. I don’t have presentations either. It’s just for folks to hang out and talk shop.\n\nOf course being the organizer you get to meet everyone and they will remember your name even if they forget everyone else. I also make a point to pull out my phone and connect with each person using LinkedIn at some point.\n\nThis requires zero dollars since everyone pays their own way. It’s low cost and low commitment. Pretty much just show up. If things go well and you develop a good routine group or return folks, talk to them about changing up the format. People like to help, and it helps you not have to do all the work.\n\nI agree on 5:30 timing and I’ve also found that having free parking available and making sure your location isn’t in the center of rush hour snarl helps too.\n\nGood luck!",

It should outline your credit terms (N30/2% Interest in balances owing, yadda yadda), steps/fees to collect, etc. The credit application I created also had separate legal verbiage for a personal guarantee.\n\nOnce you have all that signed, it should be passed onto whatever business credit bureau you've chosen to partner with, preferably one that can also provide personal credit reports. Then, based upon the information you receive: determine if you're granting credit. If you are: What is the credit limit?\n\nThe final piece is to set your POS to not process invoices once the client has hit their limit, avoiding this issue again.",

      "selftext": "**Has anyone else gone through something like this with American Express?**  If so, I would love to know **how to deal with this issue**, I will be contacting them tomorrow (Monday) morning. If you have dealt with it, how did you resolve it?\n\nI’ve been with Amex for over 25 years. Between my business and personal cards, I’ve probably run somewhere between $30–50 million through them over that time. Never missed a payment. **Never had a problem. I have paid early EVERY month** on my Plum card to receive the cash back. My personal credit score is over 800.  My business has been more profitable every year it has been in existence.  There should be zero flags to show a problem.\n\nThen out of nowhere, this past Saturday evening around 6:45 PM, I get an email saying my available credit limits have been reduced on all six of my cards. I thought it had to be spam. Logged in and it was real. Every single card had its limit cut dramatically, some by as much as 90%.\n\nThat instantly made several cards show as “over limit” by tens of thousands of dollars, even though I hadn’t made a new charge. Just because Amex decided to lower the limit after the balance was already there.  No warning, no explanation. Just an email after hours on a weekend.\n\nNow I have personal cards showing a balance greater than the credit limit, which will negatively impact my credit score if the credit bureau happens to pull the data today.\n\nSo I called the number on the back of the card and got sent to a recording saying underwriting was closed until Monday morning. There was no way to get past that prompt once I put my card info in.  They sent the email ten minutes after they closed, so there was literally no way to talk to anyone. Perfect timing, right?\n\nNow imagine if I were traveling internationally or needed those cards to cover scheduled payments. Too bad. They just stop working. Some of mine already declined Sunday morning for pending charges, and of course Amex won’t be covering any fees or fallout from that.\n\nI tried the chat on their site, spent 15 minutes explaining everything, only to be told I needed to call a “special number” where someone could help me as a “long time valued customer.” I called it, and got the same voicemail saying to try again Monday.  Valued customer...right.\n\nSo here I am, 25 years of loyalty, perfect history, and six suddenly crippled accounts that I can’t even use because someone at Amex flipped a switch and didn’t think about what that does to small business owners who rely on those cards every day.\n\nIf this can happen to me, it can happen to any of you. And it raises real questions about how Amex handles risk, or maybe just their cash exposure, without giving long-time customers any warning or chance to prepare.\n\nFor small business owners, this is something to think about before making Amex your main line of credit. Because “member since 1998” apparently doesn’t mean much when their algorithm or someone working risk on a weekend decides to cut you off on a Saturday night.",

This usually will be information from credit reporting agencies.\n\nWith Amex usually it's because something triggered an in depth review of at least one account. When this happens Amex will usually do a hard pull on credit report and going by what they find results can be what has happened to OP. Credit limits reduced, cards closed, etc....\n\nOf course when one account is affected it prompts action with all others someone has with Amex, again Citi and other CC issuers all do same thing.\n\nKeep in mind it may not be something one has done with Amex (or Citi or whoever) that triggers these sort of actions. Simply pulling hard credit report and finding something they don't like recently with any other credit related bit on report can trigger actions.\n\nThat is to say if one CC issuer (say Amex) finds account holder has high utilization, missed payments, and or anything else they view as negative with another bank or CC they can take action.",

Instead, I stumbled into a strange pattern I didn’t see coming.\n\nWith the first couple of friends, we swapped life updates, and when I shared some good news about how things had turned out for me with my small online business, the conversations just… fizzled. They stopped replying, or in some cases blocked me completely. It felt weird because I wasn’t trying to brag, just telling them what I’d been up to.\n\nThat threw me off, so with the next people I found, I downplayed my life situation and kept things simple. Suddenly, the conversations flowed and we stayed in touch. In fact, some of the people who ghosted me originally became cool with me again after I told them I’d “exaggerated” my story the first time around.\n\nIt made me realize how unpredictable people’s reactions can be when you reconnect after years. I thought sharing positive news about business success would be encouraging, but in reality it sometimes made old friends uncomfortable. On the flip side, being more low-key has kept the door open.\n\nI guess the lesson I learned is that not everyone wants to hear about your successes, even if you’re just trying to share your story. Sometimes keeping it simple and focusing on old memories is the better way to reconnect. This kinda reminds me of how some lottery winners have stories of suddenly finding a few of their friends and family members to be resentful of them after winning.\n\n#Edit:\n\nI run a one man web design business where small mom and pop shops and blue collar businesses pay a small fee each month to manage their company websites.

Of course, they’re not in top locations like Lake Como or the Amalfi Coast, but... it’s still Italy, with its culture, great food.\n\nAll the ones I’ve looked at are run by elderly owners who just want to retire. They have zero tech or marketing skills and haven’t invested much in the properties over the past decade.\n\nSo I figured that with some alternative concepts, like coliving, it would be nearly impossible not to make money (or at least be able to sell in a few years for a profit).

This spans across industries - hardly anyone has a website, and if they do it looks like one from the 1990's.   \n  \n2 - Italians really seem to like to preserve the traditional things - e.g., in my part of Liguria, they actively discourage street performers, creative artists, any non-Italian cuisine. There is a lot of local government regulation put into preserving the status quo. (this has pros and cons but for your purposes, probably a con)  \n  \n3 - You really should look into the tax situation and labor rights. You will quickly find that the economics are really tough and entrepreneurial success is essentially disincentivized big time, IMO. As a result, 'bare bones' businesses seem to be the norm - both my veterinarian and my optometrist have no web presence, make appointments by texts via WhatsApp, and they are the receptionist, the doctor, the accounting department and the cleaning staff in their business. i.e. sole proprietors, no employees.   \n  \nGood luck!",

The vendor still got the message and replied to it. I get that it’s a small etiquette thing, but to me it feels like a non-issue.\n\nNow he’s also started raising his voice at the vendor on calls, accusing them of being unprofessional when I honestly think they weren’t.

Are you eating the cost for now? Focusing more on the \"Made in USA\" angle? Finding creative ways to add value so you can raise prices?\n\nJust looking for some ideas because this is a real headache. What's been working (or not working) for you?\n\n",

We ended up completely redesigning our product to eliminate the part and ended up using 100% China-sourced parts for the new design. \n\nWe need to stop thinking of these economic decisions as having any mass beneficial cause. Trump and his cronies are dividing up the carcass of the United States. They are accelerating the fall so they can be the ones in power when it collapses with plenty of Fart Coin available in their personal coffers so they can buy up the pieces just like the Russian oligarchs did for state-owned companies after the fall of the Soviet Union. THIS is the collaboration Trump had with the Russians.

And my customer base is US manufacturers, who are also doing surprisingly well.\n\n\n\nI'm an importer as a service. I import components for US manufacturers. All of it comes from China. They use those components in their US manufacturing facility to assemble into their finished good.\n\nMy business is up this year.\n\n  \nI can only speak for myself and what my clients are doing/ told me. Other's experiences are their own. \n\nAs of last week, to date, I had only had one order cancelled due to the tariffs. They decided to make it in-house. Which they were tooled up to do.\n\nThat particular good, the tariff is 98%. The economics of it, that's not 98% increase in cost. Tariffs were already 28% before all this. So though 70% is a big increase, not terrible when you look at the overall impact to the client. That +70% on EXW. Which means before tariff, freight, my markup. Then it's their COG. Which, the actual cost of goods portion of their cost, is relatively small.\n\nThen this week, they decided to order through me from China anyway. What they calculated was that their cost to make it in house, was about the same as importing it. So by importing it, he's got his employees working on developing new products. \n\nSo in the end, now haven't lost any business due to the tariff. I was able to absorb some of the extra, and they are absorbing some. So far, as far as I know, none of my clients have had to increase their cost to the consumer. Though again, that's clearly because of the structure of me targeting US manufacturers, and how the actual percent that affects everything being minor. For those who import finished goods to sell to the consumer, it must be brutal.\n\nBeyond that, the 98% is a rare occurrence for my stuff. Most of my stuff is between 50-60%. Which it was 25-30% before. So not a huge increase. And again, it's still on EXW vs COG. So I absorb it for the most part. Sure, lower margin for me. But i'm getting more orders than before because that's how my US manufacturer clients are choosing to reduce cost.\n\nSo I am gaining market share. I'm getting more business. So i'm doing better than ever.",

          "body": "This post comes up a lot. Here's my reply the last time I saw this:\n\n&gt; My background is that I am a senior freelance website architect and full-stack developer. I am a small business owner for over 15 years and I run my own operation. One area of my business is building brochure sites, landing pages, and simple homepages for small businesses. I also build custom solutions for WordPress, and full WordPress websites for small-to-medium size businesses.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If your choice is between Squarespace, Wix, and WordPress, I highly recommend you select WordPress. It is a highly performant blogging platform and content management system. The team who builds it has significant investment and they update it constantly.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Because it's updated so frequently, you do need to perform consistent maintenance and updates, but other than that, it's a stellar platform.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I recommend Wordfence, Contact Form 7, Flamingo, Relevanssi, hCaptcha for WordPress, and WP Super Cache. These plugins are my standard install, and they basically hit every major point you need to worry about. They all have free options available, and do not require paying. The paid options are worth it though. CF7 deserves more donations.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If you are on a strict budget, I would host directly with WordPress.com and choose a nice off-the-shelf theme. For reference, WordPress.org is the free, open source self-hosted version. Most recent themes support the block editor, and you should be good to go. If you're looking at Woocommerce, Storefront is an excellent theme.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I'm not super familiar with Squarespace, but I am intimately familiar with Wix. This past year I was tasked with an emergency job to revamp a Wix site for a client who wanted to host a charity event. It cost the client a significant amount of money; far more than would have been needed if we had gone with my recommendation of a custom WordPress theme and plugin set.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When small business clients come to me asking for consultation, I ask one question:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Do you need to update your website constantly, like posting articles, blogs, events, courses, etc., or do you really just need a brochure site? Most small businesses need a small brochure site, with about 1 hour of maintenance/updates per month.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If you really just need a brochure site, a capable website developer who offers what I offer, static landing pages, is going to be far more effective for your business than managing a content management system. Ask for on-page SEO, and the following integrations: Google Analytics, Search Console Integration, Facebook/Meta pixel, Microsoft Clarity, and a one-way contact form. Your #1 traffic source is going to be Google Business Profile/Maps Integration, so ask if they can consult with you on that too.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Invest in your online presence, but don't get taken for a ride. I would strongly recommend hiring a qualified website developer who you can work with intimately one-on-one, and doesn't pass you off to a random support team. I can't emphasize enough how frustrating working with Wix support was.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nrkd8t/what_is_the_best_website_builder_for_a_small/ngiqb34/",

J’s been here for a while and does a lot for the business.\n\nFast forward, I eventually decided to join and help out too after I got laid off from my company. My dad has told me that his long term plan is for me to eventually become the CEO and take over ownership of the business. But apparently, J currently holds the title of “CEO” because my dad casually told him he could have it.\n\nI don’t think my dad realized how big of a deal that could become later, but it feels like it’s setting up potential conflict down the road (both between me and J, and between me and my dad)\n\nHas anyone dealt with something similar?

It’s sad, but I promise you he doesn’t care how you take this other person in the business. You need to start viewing him as a boss instead of your dad in this regard. Separate the two universes.

Go start your own venture. Go do something on your own for a while and maybe come back to it. Show him you’re worth it by pursuing other opportunities first and then he’ll realize how important you are. The guy he hired is temporary. As parents age, he will eventually start thinking about handing off the business to you or selling to someone else. Again, he’s his own person making decisions (not your dad).\n\n3.

It could be gym at 7-8, cook a good breakfast, a walk in the park from 9-11am then a coffee date with my partner and then a trip into the city in the afternoon, then a cheap comedy show in the evening.

The issue is you’re not gonna be able to sustain that type of hustle for very long.\n\nMy advise from owning three different businesses: take care of yourself first (physically and mentally) and the business will follow suite. You can’t expect yourself to perform well in any business or job if your body and mind are on life support.\n\nGo for walks, take small breaks throughout the day, go to the gym, play video games, read books, eat healthy food, etc.\n\nDo what you like to do so you don’t get burnt out. Running a business is not a sprint or cramming for an exam, it’s a marathon where you need to prepare and take care of yourself first to do well. You’re in it for the long haul. \n\nIf it was easy and simple, everyone would be running a successful business.",

I can’t even accurately quote clients for shipments because suddenly they’ll get hit with an unexpected charge. And for a couple of bigger clients I’ve ended up paying the fee myself to save face. But even then it’s lost business, and a massive burden. I’ve wasted hours on the phone with UPS Mumbai Team. This is worse than a tax and it’s been a roller coaster trying to run a business without having predictable numbers.

But then under \"Contact a Lender\" it literally named two of their competitors by name. It straight up told people to call these other businesses. \n\n  \nAlthough their site was mentioned in the carousel, it wasn't mentioned in the answer at all. \n\nThat query was high intent, and although the users domain ranks top 5 in the blue links and was included in the carousel, it wasn't referred and they got cut out compeletely. \n\n  \nI'd honestly recommend everyone here to take 5 mins asking Google/ChatGPT/Perplexity etc questions about your business and see what happens. Are you getting recommended (not just in the carousel but in the answer) or is your competiton. \n\nFull disclosure, my work is in this space, so I'm looking at these results all day and thought it was an important warning to share with other business owners who rely on search for customers. \n\nAnyone else seeing stuff like this in their industry?

What you're dealing with is basically a Search Party problem - when negative content ranks high for your brand searches, you need to push it down rather than trying to make it disappear. The solution isn't removal, its displacement. You need to create more content that will rank above that thread when people search your business name. Start pumping out blog posts, get featured in industry publications, create social media profiles, maybe even do some PR outreach to local business publications. The goal is to flood the first page of search results with positive content about your business so that Reddit thread gets buried on page 2 where nobody looks. Also consider reaching out to happy customers for testimonials and reviews on Google, Yelp, whatever platforms make sense for your industry. I've seen this approach work really well because you're not fighting the negative content directly, you're just making it irrelevant by giving searchers better, more recent information about your business first.",

I hated it...I at first thought I'd be \"helping\" people, only to come to realize that instead I was buddying up to doctors to convince them to write a $300/mnth drug when their patient could get a $4 generic instead. Miserable.... and against everything I believe in... but it supported my family so I did it (shamefully and regrettably). About 7 years in I started a contracting business on the side. It was 5 years before I could take a paycheck, 7 years before I could give up my day job.... and I was terrified. However, 10 years later (now) I make way better money, have a business that will retire me someday (not too long down road), have employees that I take good care of (though that comes with a lot of frustration and lack of appreciation), and am in general FAR happier in life. I wouldn't change it. \n\nWhat I'd do differently.... \n\n1. I have a business partner, that may not have been best. I would have grown faster on my own and most partnerships fail (though we work well together).\n\n2. I'd have done it sooner.... I regret selling my soul. Today we operate a very ethical business and I feel good about what we do. I still wake up (no joke... I really do) with stress-mares (not really a nightmare, but darn close)... worrying that I didn't get something done and my boss is going to come down on me or that I'm being held responsible for the unethical stuff we did (no possible repercussion in real life...I just feel like there should be).\n\n3. I'd have saved enough nest-egg/safety net while in my corp job to carry me so I could have left the day job sooner without worrying about sinking the new business or my personal financial status. Being able to fully devote myself from the start would have sped the process greatly.\n\nI think starting your bakery on the side while working is good.... but try to transition fast if you're financially able. Also... maybe look for an existing bakery with employees you can purchase (could even be no money out of pocket with a low cost owner finance). If there are a couple employees who can carry a part of the load you can have immediate cash flow and work on improvements to service/quality/profitability while devoting your evenings and weekends. You'd be surprised how many small business owners are to the point of retiring or moving on, and it's hard to sell a lot of small sole proprietor type businesses, so it may not take a lot to get someone to give you a running start.\n\nGood luck! Work hard and make it happen... as long as you make the financials work, you'll never regret the move away from corporate.",

Set a calendar reminder to go home on time.\n\nDon't get too tied up in \"how am I gonna transition, finances etc etc\"\n\nOnce your hobby becomes a growing and hopefully successful side business you'll know whether or not its realistic (or if you still want to) make the jump. Until you get paying customers, everything you are doing is just theory. So focus on doing/creating/experimenting/making and less on \"omg what if this happens in 10 years?\" \n\n  \nAlso if everything fails you can go back to a boring ass corporate job...",

Or something really small to start off… why don’t you bake for your neighbors or friends and ask them for compensation, then get feedback from that? Or something manageable like baking on the weekends and selling it online (around your neighborhood/area)? Or do pop ups? It doesn’t have to be big when you first start. Start with something small and manageable and scale your way up!\n\nI have a friend who started with just baking for her family and friends, then that eventually turned into “word of mouth”, and eventually evolved into taking orders from friends of friends, and then she started her own facebook page, and posted all of the cakes that she made for her family and friends. Now she has a great portfolio and is looking to open her own bakery! \n\nWith that, you will be given, time, feedback, experience, pictures, customers, and even ideas of what sells well, what doesn’t, who likes what, when they will like it, etc etc, without having to start a big thing right away! \n\nIt’s scary to start, of course. But if you have the passion and talent, why not start? You’ll waste the time thinking about starting anyway. Just start, and go from there! Good luck! :) \n\nSource: I don’t have much experience but this is from what I’ve witnessed from other people.",
