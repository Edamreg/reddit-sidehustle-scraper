We were all shut in leading to many students looking for virtual help\n\nI would make 10-30k a year while working my full-time job. What makes it an efficient side hustle is that relative to my job, I don't work the same amount of hours for that added cash and it's \"fun\"\n\nAt this point, I have been capped at 30k because there is a sort of ceiling on the number of clients I could take so that I can still dedicate to my 9-5. Also because the last year was much tougher. Costs, tariffs, layoffs, etc. seemed like there were fewer students looking for tutoring and I had no interest in lowering my rates. I made it up by taking on contracts with other companies who needed tutors  \n  \nI know I clearly have a viable business idea but wonder if 6 figures worthy. Is my revenue because I cannot dedicate full time to it or is this market not big enough? Has anyone else tried a side hustle and then moved it to full time after a certain revenue threshold?",

          "body": "10 to 30k on the side is great, but its not proof by itself that it replaces a salary. Right now its capped because of time, not demand, and that matters.\n\nThe real question is this: can you remove yourself from the hours. If income only goes up when you personally tutor more, then going full time just means longer days and more stress, not scale.\n\nBefore quitting I would try one thing first. Use the job as a safety net and test leverage. Hire one tutor. Raise prices slightly. Productise something. If you can push it past the current ceiling without doubling your hours, then you have something real.\n\nAlso worth saying, last year being tougher is a warning sign. You dont want to jump just as demand softens. Build a buffer. Prove 50k plus is repeatable, not a good year.\n\nIf it still works with less you involved, then yeah, different convo. Otherwise its just a very good side hustle.",

The first $1K is the hardest. After that, momentum builds.\n\n2. Referrals &gt; cold outreach once you have happy clients.\n\n3. Raising prices lost fewer clients than I expected.\n\n4. Consistency matters more than working crazy hours.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*My questions for the community:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- How long did it take you to match your day job income?\n\n\\- At what point did you consider going full-time?\n\n\\- What was your \"hockey stick\" moment where growth suddenly accelerated?\n\n\\- For those who made the jump to full-time, any regrets?\n\n\n\n\\*\\*My goal:\\*\\* Match day job income in 12-18 months total, then consider the leap.\n\n\n\nI know everyone's situation is different, but I'd love to hear real timelines and experiences.

      "selftext": "I’m a office worker, marketing role, nothing fancy. Most days by the time I get home, eat something random, and sit down, it’s already close to 9pm. That’s basically the only time I have for my own stuff.\n\nI’ve been trying to start a small side project for months now. Not some big startup dream, just a little online store idea I kept thinking about during work. The idea itself never felt that hard, it was always the starting that stopped me. Once I thought about hosting, themes, product pages, payments, I’d just close the laptop and scroll instead.\n\nLast week I finally forced myself to do something, even if it was messy. I told myself, one night, no overthinking, just try to get something online. So I basically just Googled how to start an online store, listed out the products I wanted to try, did a quick and very rough market check, and then used genstore to put together a store page. I don’t really know much about building websites, but while I was searching I realized a lot of this stuff can be auto generated now, so I just went ahead and made a rough first version instead of overthinking it. It wasn’t perfect. The copy needs work, product selection is probably bad, and I’m sure a real ecommerce person would roast it. But when I saw an actual storefront with my idea on it, at like 12:30am on a Thursday, it felt oddly motivating.\n\nI’m still figuring out whether this thing even deserves more time. But something about having a live site makes me more willing to keep going the next night instead of starting from zero again. \n\nSo if there’s a side hustle you’ve been thinking about, maybe don’t overthink it too much. Start while the excitement is still there, even if it’s not perfect, and adjust as you go. Really believe you’ll get something out of it.",

Last week my dad asked for something he thought could make his workflow easier. So I built a simple QR tracking system for his company (plus a couple of extra features). It’s just a basic MVP, no landing page, no real auth (only invite-based access), no polish. But it does what it’s supposed to do.\n\nAnd unexpectedly, 3 other companies reached out asking if they could also use it. I ended up selling all of them a yearly plan ($199/y).\n\nI’ve never experienced something like this before. We grind constantly, try to follow best practices, iterate, polish, try to post a banger tweet or whatever… And yet this simple, single-purpose, not-very-fancy product somehow sells itself. It’s wild. I always see posts saying “it’s not the product, it’s distribution,” and I’m sure they’re right for my game dev products, but in this case things played out differently.\n\nI guess sometimes solving one real problem for someone is enough. I need to remind myself of that.",

Most customers are homeowners who want to chat - about their house, their yard plans, neighborhood stuff. Just honest conversations.in my experience, not Zoom fatigue. And when they see the results, they get genuinely excited. My biggest surprise: the business side is way less screen-heavy than I expected. I do some online booking/invoicing, but it's maybe 30 minutes of admin for every 3-4 hours of actual work.\nIf you want purely hands-on, look at services where the \"done\" is obvious: pressure washing, lawn care, house cleaning, gutters, pool cleaning, junk removal.

Around March 2025 I decided to organize what I was already reading into a simple format, mainly for myself at first, just to reduce the mental overhead.\n\nOver time a few people asked if they could follow along, so I kept it going. It takes around 8 to 10 hours a week and only works because I batch everything and stick to a routine. The first few months had almost no traction, but the structure itself was useful so I didn’t stop.\n\nMost of the early growth came from being helpful in relevant threads rather than sharing links. Narrowing the focus helped a lot. Things like Twitter and SEO never really worked for me. The biggest challenge now is keeping up with it alongside a full time job and figuring out whether it’s worth continuing to invest more time into it or keep it lightweight.\n\nCurious if anyone else here has turned something they already do daily into a side project and how you decided how far to take it.\n\nEDIT : On the rebrand part. Original look was generic Canva template, tried Midjourney but text was inconsistent. Ended up using X-Design which is built for branding, took 90 mins for logo and headers. Conversion went from 1.2% to 3.8% after looking more professional. Worth fixing if your side hustle has any visual component.\n\n",

You still need to watch loan originators, understand how buyback works, and accept that liquidity can disappear when market sentiment changes.\n\nOn the positive side, cash flow is more predictable than stocks and volatility feels lower on the surface. On the negative side, platform risk is very real and trust matters more than headline returns.\n\nToday I keep P2P as a single-digit percentage of my total portfolio and treat it as a satellite allocation rather than a core holding.\n\n I am curious how others here structure their P2P exposure.",

Those map cleanly to your degrees and are easier to explain to clients than generic “freelance work.” Start by packaging one narrow service you could deliver in a week, not “I can do lots of things.” Once you have that, finding clients becomes a targeting problem instead of an identity crisis.

Found a problem people kept asking about repeatedly.\n\n**Step 2: Create the PDF** Took 1 hour to write a comprehensive guide solving that specific problem. Used AI to help format and structure it. Nothing fancy - just clear solutions.\n\n**Step 3: Build a landing page** Used an AI website builder (just gave it a prompt like \"create a landing page to sell a PDF about X\"). Took 1 hour to get it looking right. Added:\n\n* Headline describing the problem\n* What's inside the PDF\n* Price ($9)\n* Stripe payment button\n* Automated email delivery after purchase\n\n**Step 4: Post it once** Dropped it in a few relevant communities where people have that problem. Got initial traction.\n\n**Step 5: Forget about it** All sales now come from:\n\n* Word of mouth\n* People searching for solutions\n* Zero marketing from me\n\n# Why this works\n\n* One-time effort (2 hours total)\n* AI makes both PDF and landing page creation fast\n* Stripe + automated email = no manual work\n* Low price point ($9) = easy impulse buy\n* Solves real problem = people pay\n\n# The numbers\n\n* Initial work: 1 hour creating PDF + 1 hour for landing page\n* Ongoing work: 0 hours/month\n* Monthly revenue: $350/month\n* Startup cost: $0\n* Tech stack: AI tools + Stripe + automated email\n\n# The truth about \"passive\"\n\nFirst month required some marketing. After that, truly passive. Sales happen automatically from organic discovery.\n\nSmall niche = limited scale. But $350/month for 2 hours of work isn't bad.\n\n# For anyone wanting to try this\n\n1.

I see one problem with this - competition.  All these methods have one thing in common - they work on theory but they don't work in real life.  You have to heavily promote , spam and probably pay for fb ads. Today there are only a few methods that work - I am afraid this is not one of them. This method would need to have a kw research, seo optimization throughout the text and landing page and it takes way more than two hours.

          "body": "The biggest Problem with selling any digital products and especially something so simple like a PDF guide is the selling part. \n\nPeople always jump over the fact that you can't just copy paste stuff from AI tool and start selling it. Plus the marketing part such as ads or even organic traffic isn't going to turn to success on it's own. \n\nAll these posts of people making 6 figures with AI or digital marketing are too exaggerated and clickbait. I get it they do it for controversy, views and engagement, etc..But it's really annoying and makes people question everything!\n\nAnd by the time you find something interesting or worth trying out, you are already too burned out and afraid of falling for the same scam yet again.\n\nFrom my own personal research of building digital products both PDF, E-book and courses, I can easily say just from building part you have like 30 steps that you have to go through one way or the other. And just to mention that marketing and promoting comes as an extra steps on top of it all.\n\nSo, while some people got lucky and made their first few sale's with only Chatgpt most of us spend ton of time and money doing it properly. I am not saying here you can't make money without investing money or spending the least amount of time on your products but I am saying those are rare situations where people actually make it that way. \n\nJust for reference the proper way of selling digital products online include:\n1. Researching the audience/demand \n2. Researching the competition (competitor brands, business, agency's, etc...)\n3. Figuring out your product (everything from what product is supposed to be, what problems it solves and how it transformers people or their situation, etc...)\n4. Product creation (How to write, film or design your product, how to edit and put together everything, what tools you need to do all that, etc...)\n5. Figuring out market channels (where are you going to sell your product, how are you going to package it, which format, paid or free advertising or both, etc...)\n6. Content Creation if using free traffic or Facebook ads, YouTube ads, Google ads if using Paid Advertising. \n7. Consistency &amp; Growth (How are you going to connect everything and make it sustainable and long term without losing traction and how to scale it later on)\n\nAnd these are just some of the things that real business owners and content creators have to know and be able to use to reach that success that everyone has been bragging about. If we really wanted to go all in there are all kinds of important stuff still needed like AI understanding, SEO, Email Marketing, Social Media Marketing, etc... \n\nP.S This post is from my own personal experience and research that I have been doing for last 10 years.

She told her friend at church about it and next thing I know I have 3 more people asking me to do it.\n\nI bought a decent video capture device on Amazon (the Elgato one, around $80) and started posting on local Facebook groups. Turns out theres SO many boomers and gen x folks who have boxes of old tapes, camcorder videos, and even those weird mini DV tapes sitting in their garage that they want digitized but have no idea how to do it.\n\nI charge $15 per tape for VHS and $20 for camcorder tapes cause they take a bit longer. Most people have like 10 to 30 tapes so the jobs add up quick. December was insane cause everyone wanted them done before the holidays, made around $950 that month. Its slowed down a bit now but still getting steady work.\n\nI can literally just let the tapes run while I'm working my regular job from home or watching TV. I also upload everything to a google drive folder for them and burn it to a DVD if they want (extra $5). Some people tip really well too cause they get emotional seeing their old family videos.\n\nNow I actually have $2k set aside from Stаke, but I'm kinda stuck on how to scale this up beyond just me doing it. I can only run like 2 or 3 tapes at a time with my current setup. Anyone have ideas on how to grow this without it turning into a full time thing? Or should I just keep it small and steady?",

They want new ones but they’re terrified of one thing: being trapped.\n\nTraditional agencies charge $3000 upfront, then $200 every time you want to change your hours or update a price.\n\nBusiness owners hate this. They want control.\n\nThe Solution: \n\nGoogle Sheet Connection\n\nWebsites that pull data from a Google Sheet.\n\nWhen the business owner edits the spreadsheet (changes hours, updates prices, adds services)\n\nThey edit a spreadsheet. Website updates instantly.\n\nAfter validating manually (got 10 sales in the first month), built automation that runs daily:\n\nEvery day automatically:\n\n\t1.\tLead generation: Google Maps API finds 1000 businesses with outdated websites\n\n\t2.\tSite building: AI generates professional sites using their business info\n\n\t3.\tSheet setup: Apps Script connects each site to a Google Sheet\n\n\t4.\tVideo creation: Tool generates personalized demo videos\n\n\t5.\tOutreach: Email automation sends demos to all 1000 businesses\n\nMarket is massive.

If the OP is only making $500/day, he is running a charity, not a business.\n* Sending 1,000 cold emails daily with video links or attachments is the fastest way to get your domain blacklisted by Google and Outlook. You aren't reaching \"1,000 plumbers\"; you’re reaching 1,000 spam folders.\n* Selling a website for a one-time fee of $500 sounds great until the client accidentally deletes a cell in their Google Sheet and breaks the site. You aren't \"passive\"—you're a 24/7 tech support line for 300+ non-tech-savvy business owners.\n*  AI-generated sites are \"thin content.\" A plumber doesn't want a pretty site; they want calls. If this site doesn't rank on Page 1 (which it won't without real SEO work), the plumber will ask for a refund in 30 days.\n\nThis BS isn't a \"business system.\" It’s a \"Lead Magnet.\" Usually, the person posting this is about to sell a course, a \"mastermind,\" or an affiliate link to the AI tools they are \"using.\"",

      "selftext": "**TL;DR:** I got laid off in late 2024, saw a post on this subreddit about ElevenLabs voice cloning, and thought \"why not.\" 13 months later, I have 8 AI voice clones earning me over $1,000/month while I sleep. This is the detailed guide I wish I had when I started. I'll show you exactly how to do it, step by step.\n\n---\n\n## The Real Numbers–No Clickbait Here\n\nLet me just get this out of the way:\n\n- **Total earned to date:** $8,985\n- **Current monthly earnings:** ~$1,160/month\n- **Number of voices:** 8\n- **Time invested per month now:** Maybe 1-2 hours (checking stats, occasionally tweaking things)\n- **Full portfolio breakdown PDF (with earnings screenshots):** [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QpjMjdh4MU4vIadC6ZjSYqKWwhF4Puf2/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nI'm sharing my actual numbers because I've seen too many low-effort posts on this sub that say \"you can make money with AI voices!\" and then provide zero details. That's not helpful. This guide is going to be long, but by the end, you'll know exactly how to do this yourself.\n\n---\n\n## My Story\n\nIn late 2024, I got laid off. Not ideal, but I suddenly had time to explore side income ideas I'd been bookmarking for months.\n\nI stumbled across a post on this very subreddit about licensing your voice on ElevenLabs. The concept was simple: record your voice, upload it to their platform, and get paid every time someone uses it for their projects (YouTube videos, audiobooks, apps, whatever).\n\nI have a background in audio engineering, so I figured I had a slight edge. But honestly, the technical barrier is way lower than I expected. If you can follow instructions and speak clearly into a microphone, you can do this.\n\nI created my first voice, and within a few weeks, I was making a couple hundred dollars. I immediately created another. Then another.\n\n**Here's what most posts don't tell you: the real strategy is building a portfolio of voices, not just one.**\n\nMy top-performing voice averages $308/month. But I have another that only makes $16/month. If I'd stopped at one voice and it happened to be the $16 one, I probably would've given up and told everyone this doesn't work.\n\nInstead, I kept going. Now I have 8 voices across different categories, and the portfolio as a whole is what makes this a legit income stream.\n\n---\n\n## What Is Voice Cloning? Let me explain.\n\nElevenLabs is an AI company that offers text-to-speech technology. Users can type text and have it spoken aloud by AI voices.\n\nHere's where you come in: ElevenLabs has a Voice Library where creators can upload their voice clones and license them to other users. Every time someone uses your voice to generate audio, you get paid.\n\n**Who uses these voices?**\n\n- YouTubers and content creators\n- Audiobook producers\n- App developers\n- Podcasters\n- Game developers\n- Businesses making training videos\n- People creating voiceovers for social media\n\nThe demand is massive and growing. AI-generated voiceovers are everywhere now, and people need high-quality, natural-sounding voices.\n\n---\n\n## What You'll Need Before Starting\n\n### The Essentials:\n\n1. **A decent microphone.** You don't need a $500 setup. A solid USB condenser mic like the Audio-Technica AT2020 (~$100) or even the Fifine K669B (~$30) can work. The key is clarity, not expense.\n\n2. **A quiet recording space.** This matters more than your mic. A closet full of clothes actually makes a great recording booth. You want minimal echo and no background noise (no AC humming, no traffic, no roommates).\n\n3. **Basic audio software.** Audacity is free and works great. GarageBand if you're on Mac. I personally use Pro Tools, but that's overkill for this.\n\n4. **30+ minutes of high-quality audio.** This is ElevenLabs' minimum requirement for a Professional Voice Clone. More on what to record later.\n\n5. **An ElevenLabs Creator Plan.** That's $22/month ($11 for your first month with the 50% discount). This is your only ongoing cost. [More on this below]\n\n### Optional But Helpful:\n\n- A pop filter (~$10) to reduce plosive sounds (harsh \"P\" and \"B\" sounds)\n- A mic stand or boom arm to keep positioning consistent\n- Basic knowledge of audio editing (removing breaths, normalizing levels)\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Set Up Your ElevenLabs Account\n\nHead to ElevenLabs and create an account. Here's my link: https://try.elevenlabs.io/earn-with-voice-clones\n\nIt takes you straight to the pricing page where you can grab 50% off your first month. If this guide saves you from the 13 months of trial and error it took me to figure all this out, using the link is an easy way to say thanks. I get a small kickback at no extra cost to you.\n\n**Important:** You need the Creator Plan (minimum $22/month after month 1) to create Professional Voice Clones. ElevenLabs has a free tier and a Starter Plan, but unfortunately you can't create Professional voice clones with either of them.\n\nAlso, here's something most guides don't mention: **Each Creator Plan account only allows ONE Professional Voice Clone.**\n\nThey offer a Business plan which allows up to 3 Professional Voice Clones, but they charge $1,320/month for that… ridiculous. I know.\n\nSo, if you want to build a portfolio like I did (which I highly recommend), you'll need to create multiple accounts. Each account is $22/month with the Creator Plan, but even a mediocre voice should earn enough to cover that cost within a few weeks. My worst-performing voice still makes ~$16/month, and most of mine pay for themselves many times over.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: The Most Important Part: Record Your Audio\n\nYou need at least 30 minutes of clean, high-quality audio. But here's what nobody tells you:\n\n**What you record matters as much as how you record it.**\n\nThe AI learns your voice patterns, inflections, and style from your recording. If you record yourself reading a novel in a calm, steady narration voice, your clone will sound great for audiobooks but weird for energetic social media content.\n\n**Match your recording to your intended use case:**\n\n| If you want your voice used for... | Record yourself... |\n|:--|:--|\n| Audiobooks / Narration | Reading fiction or non-fiction passages |\n| Podcasts | Having a conversational monologue |\n| Meditation / Relaxation | Speaking slowly and soothingly |\n| YouTube explainers | Explaining topics in an engaging way |\n| Character voices | Doing the character consistently |\n\n### Recording Tips:\n\n1. **Stay consistent.** Same mic position, same distance, same room, same energy level throughout.\n\n2. **Avoid mouth sounds.** Stay hydrated. Do a few takes if you get clicky mouth sounds.\n\n3. **Leave room tone.** Record 10 seconds of silence (just the room) at the start. This helps with noise removal later.\n\n4. **Don't over-edit.** Light noise removal is fine, but heavy processing can confuse the AI. Keep it natural.\n\n5. **Aim for -6dB to -3dB peaks.** Not too quiet, not clipping. Audacity has a great normalizing feature for this.\n\n6. **Record more than 30 minutes.** I usually aim for 45-60 minutes of raw audio, which gives me 30+ minutes of clean, edited content.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Create Your Professional Voice Clone\n\nOnce you have your audio files ready:\n\n1. Click \"Voices\" in the left sidebar\n2. Click \"Create or Clone a Voice\"\n3. Select \"Professional Voice Clone\"\n4. Accept the terms\n\nNow you'll need to:\n\n**Name your voice.** Pick something memorable and fitting. \"Calm Sarah\" or \"Energetic Mike\" tells users what to expect better than \"Voice_Final_v2.\"\n\n**Write a description.** Be specific about what your voice is good for. Example: \"A warm, friendly American male voice perfect for explainer videos, podcasts, and corporate narration. Clear articulation with a conversational tone.\"\n\n**Add tags.** These are crucial for discoverability. Just click through the dropdowns to find the most relevant options for your voice.\n\n**Upload your audio.** You can upload multiple files. Make sure they total at least 30 minutes.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Verify Your Voice\n\nElevenLabs requires voice verification to prove you're uploading your own voice (not stealing someone else's).\n\n**Here's how it works:**\n\n1. ElevenLabs generates a random sentence\n2. You record yourself reading it\n3. Their AI compares your verification recording to your uploaded audio\n4. If they match, you're verified\n\nThis is where most people mess up. The verification is picky. Here's how to pass it on the first try:\n\n- **Do it right after recording.** Stuff like humidity, sleep, or too much coffee can change your voice tone just enough to mess up the verification.\n- **Use the exact same setup.** Same mic, same room, same distance, same position.\n- **Match your energy.** If your uploaded audio was calm, verify calmly. If it was energetic, bring that energy.\n- **You only get a few attempts.** Too many failures and you'll get locked out temporarily.\n\n**Pro tip:** If you're using audio processing (EQ, compression, etc.) on your uploaded recordings, you'll want that same processing on your verification recording.\n\nI use a free tool called BlackHole (Mac) to route my DAW's processed output back into the verification recording. This way, my verification sounds identical to my uploaded audio. If you're on Windows, VoiceMeeter does the same thing.\n\nOnce submitted, the voice takes 2-6 hours to process. You'll get an email when it's ready.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Create a Killer Voice Preview\n\nThis is your sales pitch. When users browse the Voice Library, they'll hear a short preview of each voice. You want yours to stand out.\n\n1. Go to Voices → My Voices\n2. Click the \"a\" icon to generate speech with your voice\n3. Create a preview that's 70-150 characters (aim for close to 150)\n\n**Two approaches:**\n\n**Option A: Speak directly to the listener**\n\n&gt; \"Hey there! I'm Jake, and I'm here to make your content sound amazing. Whether it's a podcast, YouTube video, or audiobook, let's create something great together.\"\n\n**Option B: Demonstrate your voice's purpose**\n\n&gt; \"The morning mist rolled across the valley as she opened the letter, her hands trembling with anticipation. Today would change everything.\"\n\n**Dial in the settings:**\n\nPlay with the sliders (speed, stability, exaggeration) and generate multiple versions until you get one that sounds natural and represents your voice well.\n\n**Important:** As of now, you can only use V2 voice models for previews. I've had the best results with \"Eleven Multilingual v2.\" I think it sounds closest to the original voice.\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Publish to the Voice Library\n\nTime to go live:\n\n1. Click the three dots (⋮) next to your voice\n2. Click \"Share voice\"\n3. Toggle \"Sharing\" to ON\n4. Toggle \"Publish to the Voice Library\" to ON\n\n**Note:** If you use a VPN, turn it off for this step. The sharing toggle sometimes doesn't appear with VPNs enabled. Weird bug, but it got me stuck for an hour.\n\n**Settings to configure:**\n\n- **Live moderation** prevents your voice from being used for adult content. Disabling it maximizes earnings potential (more users can access your voice), but it's a personal choice.\n\n- **Custom Voice Preview** is where you select your best generation from Step 5.\n\n- **Notice Period** determines how long existing users can keep using your voice after you remove it. Longer notice periods mean higher revenue share. I recommend 6 months or more.\n\n- **Submit your voice name.** Follow ElevenLabs' naming format. You can't change this later, so make it count.\n\nAfter submission, a human (I think) reviews your voice. During business hours, approval usually takes less than 24 hours. Weekend submissions might wait until Monday.\n\n---\n\n## Step 7: Set Up Payouts\n\nYou need to connect a bank account to get paid:\n\n1. Click your profile picture (top right)\n2. Click \"Payouts\"\n3. Click \"Create payout account\"\n4. Follow the prompts to set up Stripe Express\n\nPayouts happen weekly. You can watch your earnings accumulate in real-time on the Payouts page.\n\n**Tax note for US folks:** ElevenLabs doesn't withhold taxes. They'll send you a 1099-MISC at year end. Set aside money for taxes. I put away about 25-30% of my voice earnings just to be safe. You can also write off the subscription fees as a deduction, so make sure to keep receipts!\n\n---\n\n## The Strategy That 10x'd My Earnings\n\nOkay, you've got one voice live. Here's how to actually make real money:\n\n### Build a Portfolio\n\nOne voice is a lottery ticket. A portfolio is a strategy.\n\nMy 8 voices span different categories:\n\n- Meditation / Calm (my top earner at ~$309/month)\n- Narration (2 voices, ~$120/month combined)\n- Conversational / Podcast (~$110/month)\n- Character voices (~$100/month)\n- ASMR (2 newer voices, too early to judge)\n\n**Why multiple voices?**\n\n- Different users search for different things. Your voice might be perfect for multiple categories, but each voice can only have one primary category.\n- Hedges your bets. If one voice flops, others might carry you.\n- Compounds over time. 8 voices earning $100/month beats 1 voice earning $300/month.\n\n### \"But I only have one voice!\"\n\nNo, you have many. Try:\n\n- Different pitch ranges (speak higher, speak lower)\n- Different energy levels (calm vs. energetic)\n- Different speeds (slow and deliberate vs. quick and punchy)\n- Different personas (professional vs. casual vs. warm vs. authoritative)\n- Character voices if you can do them\n\nEach variation = new voice = new account = new income stream.\n\n### Reverse-Engineer What Works\n\nBefore creating a new voice, I research:\n\n1. Go to the Voice Library \"Explore\" tab\n2. Search keywords for your intended niche (e.g., \"meditation,\" \"podcast,\" \"narration\")\n3. Look at the top-performing voices\n4. Study their names, descriptions, tags, and previews\n5. Note what they're doing well\n\nAsk yourself:\n\n- What keywords are they using?\n- How do they describe the voice?\n- What does their preview say/do?\n- Is this niche saturated or underserved?\n\nThen create a voice that fits the proven formula while adding your own twist. Don't copy, but definitely learn from winners.\n\n### Optimize Everything\n\n- **Tags matter.** Use all the relevant ones. Think about what users would search.\n- **Description matters.** Be specific and benefit-focused.\n- **Preview matters.** Make those 150 characters count.\n- **Voice quality matters.** Better recordings = better clones = more usage.\n\n---\n\n## Realistic Expectations\n\nLet me be honest about what to expect:\n\n**Month 1:** You'll probably make somewhere between $10-50. Don't be discouraged. The algorithm needs time to surface your voice to users.\n\n**Months 2-3:** If your voice is decent and well-tagged, you should see growth. $50-150/month is reasonable.\n\n**Months 4+:** Things stabilize. You'll have a sense of whether a voice is a winner or underperformer.\n\n**My portfolio breakdown:**\n\n| Tier | Voices | Avg Monthly | % of Revenue |\n|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n| Top performer (&gt;$250/mo) | 1 | $309 | 27% |\n| Strong ($100-150/mo) | 3 | $111 | 36% |\n| Moderate ($50-100/mo) | 1 | ~$100 | 9% |\n| Underperforming (&lt;$50/mo) | 1 | $16 | 1% |\n| Too new to judge | 2 | TBD | - |\n\nNot every voice will be a home run. That's fine. The portfolio approach smooths out the variance.\n\n---\n\n## Common Questions\n\n**Do I need professional audio experience?**\n\nNo. I have it, and it helps, but I've seen people with basic setups do well. Clean audio in a quiet room matters more than expensive gear.\n\n**How much time does this take?**\n\nUpfront: Maybe 2-5 hours per voice (recording, editing, uploading, optimizing). Ongoing: Almost none. I check my stats (and bank account) every few weeks. It's genuinely passive.\n\n**Is the market saturated?**\n\nThere are a lot of voices, but demand is growing fast. The key is finding your niche. Generic \"male narrator\" is crowded. \"Soothing meditation guide\" or \"energetic Gen-Z explainer\" is less so.\n\n**Can I do this outside the US?**\n\nYes! ElevenLabs pays creators worldwide via Stripe. Tax implications vary by country, so check your local laws.\n\n**What if my voice gets rejected?**\n\nMake sure your audio quality is good and your verification matches your uploaded content. I've never had a rejection, so I can't speak to the appeals process.\n\n---\n\n## Quick-Start Checklist\n\nIf you want to get started today:\n\n- Sign up for ElevenLabs Creator Plan\n- Set up your recording space (quiet room, mic, software)\n- Record 30-45 minutes of audio (match your intended use case)\n- Edit lightly (remove mistakes, normalize levels)\n- Create Professional Voice Clone\n- Pass verification (same setup as recording!)\n- Generate preview (max 150 characters)\n- Publish to Voice Library\n- Set up Stripe payouts\n- Repeat with new voices to build portfolio\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThis isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. It took me 13 months to get to $1,160/month, and I put real effort into building and optimizing my portfolio.\n\nBut here's what I love about it:\n\n- **It's genuinely passive.** I haven't touched most of my voices in months.\n- **It scales.** More voices means more income streams.\n- **Low startup cost.** $11 for your first month, basic mic, free software.\n- **Growing market.** AI voice usage is exploding.\n\n**Ready to start building your voice portfolio?** Here's my affiliate link: https://try.elevenlabs.io/earn-with-voice-clones\n\nYou get 50% off your first month and everything I learned in 13 months about turning this into $1k+/month. I get a small referral bonus. We all win. Seriously, good luck. Drop questions in the comments if you get stuck. I'll try to answer as many as I can.\n\nNow go make some money! 🎤",

          "body": "Solid write-up overall very thorough 👍  \nA couple things that might help people not overthink it:  \nThe barrier to entry is still low. A couple hundred bucks a month is very doable *right now*, even without pro audio experience. That said, more people are catching on, so this probably won’t be wide open forever.  \nPeople tend to overcomplicate the setup. At its core it’s really just:\n\n1. Sign up for [Elevenlabs](https://share.google/YX0r067VkJEGa0KHz)\n2. Choose the Creator Plan\n3. Upload a clean voice sample (30 mins minimum — honestly 2–3 hours is even better)\n4. Pass the voice captcha (verification)\n5. Toggle Shared + Discovery in Voice Library\n6. Wait \\~1–2 days for approval\n\nYou’re basically licensing your voice like a voice actor. Users grab your voice for audiobooks, YouTube shorts, explainers, etc., and you get paid every time it’s used. No outreach, no client management.  \nCharacterization matters more than people realize. Slight pitch, pacing, or energy changes can make the same voice feel totally different  and those variations often perform better than a generic “narrator” voice.\n\nAlso appreciate you being upfront about expectations and portfolio strategy that’s where most people go wrong thinking one voice is enough for $1000/month.",

      "selftext": "So right now I make roughly between $857-$900/month renting out washers and dryers COMPLETLEY remotley.\n\nI've never seen these washers and dryers in person EVER, or even know HOW to operate a washer/dryer (yes i'm a screenager).\n\nSo I saw this video on youtube from this youtube channel that was interviewing this dude that makes like 50k/month renting out washers and dryers (revenue only) but he does all of the maintence/repairs and delivery so his margins are pretty high. If i had to guess he probably inflated his numbers in some way to sell a shiny object syndrome dream because he has a skool community course that he sells but the business that he operates is for sure profitable.\n\nThe other caviot is that he has his own trailor/scrap yard for storage/hauling, and used to work as a dryer/washer repair tech so all of his repairs are \"free\" (done by him). I don't have any of that but I could defintley afford it (I have 57k in savings from other side hustles and some luck).\n\nThe whole video wasn't SUPER helpful, besides the facebook marketplace segment, where the guy showcases how he does his FREE organic advertising on facebook to do 50k/month in RV, and as someone who has multiple accounts on facebook listing washer and dryer rentals, I can vouch that I get over 30+ inquiries a day from 5 facebook account and don't usually have time/forget to respond to prospects. (im in texas)\n\nSince I didnt have a truck or storage unit, I cold called a few washer and dryer wholesellers on google maps and worked out an agreement, I know its a killer deal but he charges me $400 for a SET of washers and dryers (amanas and whirlpools), and $50 to INSTALL them. (Yes I've been told by many people that this is a crazy deal), and he also doesn't charge me for storage if anyone ever defaults and I have no where else to send my washers and dryers too.\n\nRight now, I've been sitting on a set of 6 washers and dryers and do a \"rent to own\" business model, in which most people default out of. Here are my payment options:\n\n$104/month rent to own for 12 months (nobody gets this)\n\n$80/month rent to own for 18 months (8 people have this)\n\n$65/month rent to own for 24 months (2 people have this)\n\nOne thing I have noticed is that people DO screw you over in this business model, but it usually is not TOO terrible.\n\nThe only time I have been screwed over is when I had a few people sign a contract for a 1 or 2 year lease on the washer or dryer and they default after the FIRST month because they ran out of money (which is destined in this market segment), or they bought their own washer and dryer (wtf???)\n\nSo another thing I do is charge DOUBLE the security deposit, so if someone asks for $80/month, I charge them $160 for delivery and install (everything is through stripe). This obviously leads to fewer conversions but there are still ALOT of people out there that will be more than willing to pay $160 for the delivery and install. ($80 one time payment, $80 reccuring payment). This removes all risk for THIS instance because my maximum downside is $100 ($50 for the install and $50 for my delivery guy to remove it). Obviously there is a risk of them just \"stealing\" the washer and dryer, which is ALOT more likley because of the targeted market segment (low income people).\n\nI've never gotten a washer or dryer \"stolen\", it's just not something that happens, but if it does happen, I told each customer that I have a kill switch on them (I don't but I'm sure this deters them from doing so)however I know this is defintely NOT full proof and I am brainstorming a solution. (I'm sure its not super hard to set up). I've cycled through 18 people over the course of the last 5 months, and as I said earlier, I still profit $60 even if I get screwed on the first month.\n\nI've been doing this for 5 months now so my sets JUST broke even (not by that much), so next month will be my first month of REAL profit.\n\nHere is my \"funnel\" or so you call it.\n\nCustomer reaches out on facebook marketplace ---&gt; I send them the prices ---&gt;they pick an option and then typically ask for same day delivery --&gt; I collect their address and number, call them then charge them a premium for same day delivery --&gt; I send them the payment portal to pay the double deposit (some customers prefer to do it when we are on site but I always try to do it before i dispatch my delivery guy) --&gt; I dispatch my delivery guy --&gt; delivery guy installs washer and dryer.--&gt; I send customer contract.\n\nSome more general tips:\n\n\\-MAKE SURE that the customer pays you MORE than what it costs for you to deliver and repo the unit if you are doing it through a third party like I did.\n\n\\-facebook market place is your BEST friend, please do not pay for ANY advertising.\n\n\\-get on the phone with the customer to build trust (nobody is going to send you $160 from just texting)\n\n\\-Call at LEAST 5 washer/dryer wholesellers to get the best prices on USED sets.\n\nI'm thinking about scaling another 10 or so washer and dryer sets over the next 3 months and implmenting ACTUAL kill switches (this will be the first time I ever see any of my washer and dryers).\n\nEdit: I believe this constitutes as passive income because after all of the set up(phone calls, messaging, document signing), it’s hands off) ",

I understand that most “passive” income requires upfront time, effort, or capital, and I’m fine with that as long as it’s something that can realistically scale and become more hands-off over time.  \n  \nI’m interested in hearing what has actually worked for people here while maintaining a normal 9-5 schedule. What income streams were worth the initial investment of time or money? Which ones ended up being more active than expected?  \n  \nI’m open to things like online businesses, digital products, investing, or other side hustles that can coexist with full-time work. If you’re willing to share, I’d appreciate details like how long it took to see results, how much ongoing maintenance is required, and any common mistakes beginners should avoid.",

          "body": "I'm in a similar boat, full-time job but I've managed to build up a few income streams on the side.  \nMy main passive income comes from dividend investing. I've been consistently putting money into dividend-paying stocks and ETFs over the past few years, and now I'm at the point where I'm getting a few hundred dollars quarterly without doing anything. The key was starting early and being consistent with contributions, even if they were small at first. It took about 2-3 years before it felt \"real,\" but now it genuinely requires zero maintenance beyond occasional portfolio rebalancing.\n\nFor semi-passive stuff, I also do side hustles when I have free time. I use Freecash to pick up some extra money during lunch breaks or when I'm watching TV. It's not life-changing money, but it's nice beer money for tasks that take minimal effort. The beauty of it is I can do it whenever I want, no commitment.\n\nMy advice: Start with something that requires minimal ongoing decisions (like index fund investing) and layer on active side hustles as your schedule allows. The combination has worked well for me because the passive stuff grows in the background while I can scale the active stuff up or down based on how busy work gets.  \nHappy to answer any questions if you want more details!",

      "selftext": "I work a pretty boring corporate job in logistics. good salary but soul crushing. always wanted to do something creative on the side but honestly I have zero interest in being on camera. like none. my face is not going on the internet, period. so I spent a lot of time researching faceless content and kept seeing people talk about AI generated stuff.\n\nthe idea came from my girlfriend actually. she follows a ton of fashion accounts on instagram and pointed out that some of them looked kinda off. like the models were too perfect or the lighting was weird. turned out a bunch of them were using AI generated images. that got me thinking.\n\nso around january last year I decided to start a fitness motivation account. yeah I know, super saturated niche. but I figured the content would be easier to create since its mostly just aesthetic photos with motivational quotes. nothing groundbreaking.\n\nthe first three months were rough. I was using midjourney and some other tools to generate fitness model images but the problem was consistency. every image looked like a different person. followers would comment stuff like “who is this” or “thought this was a different girl” and it killed any sense of brand identity. I almost quit around month two because the engagement was terrible and I was spending like 2 hours a day just trying to get usable images.\n\nmonth four I started experimenting with different approaches. tried a bunch of tools like APOB, artbreeder, and some others I found on reddit. the game changer was figuring out how to maintain a consistent character across posts. once I locked in “her” look (athletic build, dark hair, mid 20s vibe) things started clicking. people actually started following because they thought they were following a real person’s fitness journey.\n\nthe content strategy was simple. post once a day, always the same “person” in different workout settings or athleisure outfits. gym shots, outdoor runs, yoga poses, that kind of thing. captions were either motivational quotes or fake personal stories about “my” fitness journey. felt a little weird at first writing in first person as this fictional character but honestly nobody questioned it.\n\nmonth six I hit 8k followers which qualified me for some micro influencer platforms. got my first brand deal for $75 to post about a protein powder. the brand sent product shots and I just had to incorporate their messaging. easy money for like 20 minutes of work.\n\nthe income breakdown right now at month 11:\n\nbrand deals: averaging about $280/month. I get maybe 4 to 5 offers per month, accept 2 or 3 that actually fit the account aesthetic. pay ranges from $50 to $120 per post depending on the brand.\n\naffiliate links: around $60/month from amazon associates. I link workout gear and supplements in my bio and stories. conversion rate is garbage honestly but it adds up.\n\nso total is roughly $340/month. not quitting my job money but considering I spend maybe 45 minutes a day on it now (batch creating content on sundays helps a lot), the hourly rate is decent.\n\nthe hard parts nobody talks about:\n\nfirst, the guilt. there are real fitness influencers grinding every day, actually working out, filming themselves, and here I am with a fake person getting brand deals. I’ve made peace with it because the brands know what they’re getting (I’m transparent that its an AI persona when they ask directly) but it still feels weird sometimes.\n\nsecond, the technical learning curve. getting consistent faces, good lighting, realistic poses took forever to figure out. my first hundred images were unusable. hands still look weird sometimes and I have to regenerate a lot.\n\nthird, engagement farming. you still have to actually engage with followers, respond to DMs, comment on other accounts. the content creation might be automated but the community building isn’t. I probably spend more time on engagement than actual content creation.\n\nthings I wish I knew earlier:\n\npick a niche where the AI aesthetic actually works. fitness, fashion, travel photography all work well because people expect polished, professional looking images. something like “day in my life” content would be way harder to fake convincingly.\n\ndon’t cheap out on the tools. I wasted two months using free generators that produced obvious AI garbage. the paid tools cost money but the quality difference is massive.\n\ntreat it like a real business from day one. I set up a separate email, separate instagram account obviously, and track everything in a spreadsheet. revenue, costs, time spent, engagement rates. helps you figure out what’s actually working.\n\nthe future plan is to expand to tiktok with short form video content. some of the newer tools can do image to video stuff that looks pretty convincing. already tested a few clips and the engagement seems promising. if I can crack video content, the brand deal rates go up significantly.\n\nalso thinking about starting a second account in a different niche. maybe home decor or cooking. the playbook is pretty repeatable once you figure it out.\n\nthe monthly time investment now is probably around 12 to 15 hours total. sundays I batch create 20 to 30 images for the week, schedule them out, then just check in daily for engagement. compared to the 40 plus hours I was putting in at the beginning, it finally feels somewhat passive.\n\nstill have a decent emergency fund saved up from my day job so worst case if the account gets banned tomorrow I’m not ruined. but so far instagram hasn’t flagged anything and the follower growth has been steady at about 800 to 1000 new followers per month.\n\nthe whole experience taught me that passive income is never truly passive at the start. the first six months were basically a part time job that paid nothing. but now that the systems are in place and the account has momentum, the effort to income ratio finally makes sense.",

After 4 years of testing different side hustles, I’ve finally realized that the secret to success in 2026 is building high-value, low-friction digital products.\n\nSince I just had my first few sales on my breakdown today, I wanted to pass on 14 specific lessons I've learned to help you guys get a head start:\n\n1. **Solve \"Micro-Pain\" Points:** Don't solve a life problem; solve a 2-hour problem.\n2. **Prioritize Clarity over Length:** A 10-page guide that works is better than a 100-page book that is confusing.\n3. **The \"Coffee\" Price Point:** Selling for a low price is the \"sweet spot\" for impulse buys and building trust quickly.\n4. **Validation First:** Don't spend a month building. Spend 48 hours on a \"Version 1\" to see if anyone wants it.\n5. **Use \"Social Proof\":** Once you get your first sale, tell people! It shows your product is real and working.\n6. **Focus on Workflows:** Passive income isn't a \"set it and forget it\" magic trick; it's a repeatable system.\n7. **Organize your \"Digital Office\":** Separate your brainstorming time from your execution time to avoid burnout.\n8. **Build for 2026:** People want fast, actionable roadmaps, not long-winded theory.\n9. **Be Transparent:** If you use tools like AI to help you, be honest about it. Authenticity is a superpower on Reddit.\n10. **Community is King:** Provide 10x more value in comments than you do in your sales pitch.\n11. **The \"Loop\" over the \"Launch\":** Don't just launch and stop. Every customer question is a clue for your next update. Improving your product based on real feedback is what creates long-term passive income.\n12. **Own Your Traffic:** Don't just rely on one platform. Use social media to drive people to a simple landing page or email list. This way, you aren't at the mercy of an algorithm change.\n13. **Compound Your Assets:** One guide is a side hustle; five guides are a business. Once you find a workflow that works, repeat it for different \"Micro-Pain\" points in the same niche.\n14. **Focus on \"Evergreen\" Value:** Trends die fast. Solve a problem that people will still have 12 months from now. That is the difference between a quick buck and a steady income stream.\n\n**I've pinned the full 11-page breakdown on my Reddit profile for anyone who wants the deep dive (I put it there to keep this feed clean!).** I’m happy to chat in the comments if you have questions!\n\n**Note on this post:** I used AI to help me structure and write this post so that it is easy to read and the information is presented clearly for everyone.\n\n*(Disclaimer: The link on my profile leads to my personal digital product for beginners).*",

Most people make it sound like if you’re not rich by 25 you’ve failed, but that’s just not real life.\n\nOP, the average business owner actually starts around 40. Social media loves pushing the young rich outliers because it gets clicks, not because it’s normal. You genuinely have time. The good thing is you’re aware of it and you’re trying to change things. That already puts you ahead.\n\nIf I had one suggestion, it would be to put as much time as possible into learning. But not learning what you think you should learn. Learn what actually energizes you. That matters more than people admit. I found a bunch of resources along the way too, like this newsletter https://wealthrewired.beehiiv.com which helped me reframe how I thought about growth and time.\n\nAt one point I literally gave myself a learning budget. I let myself spend money on books, newsletters, courses, whatever helped me move forward. Amazon books, trends.co which was about $300 a year, theadvault.co.uk which is free. I didn’t care what the format was, I just needed momentum.\n\nFor context, my first job after college was in music after I ran out of money as a music producer and had to pivot. I was making about $35k a year in LA which was nowhere near enough to live. While working there I started experimenting with online businesses on the side. After some trial and error I had a couple small wins, then my company found out and didn’t like me building things on the side. I went back to work, hid my projects honestly, but kept going because I enjoyed it. Eventually I got good enough at coding to leave for a job I liked more, paid me double, and let me keep building side projects.\n\nI’ve felt lost more times than I can count. That feeling doesn’t mean you’re failing. Use it as fuel, keep learning, and stay focused on what actually pulls you forward.",

Well, I think Roblox development might actually be it.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* 350M+ users, mostly kids with disposable Robux (their currency)\n* One-click purchases built into the platform\n* Games can generate revenue 24/7 once published\n* Low barrier to entry with AI coding tools now\n\nI started experimenting with [Rebirth](https://userebirth.com/), an AI tool that helps you code Roblox games. It automatically tests and debugs, so you don't need to be a programming wizard.\n\nThe crazy part? A simple game called \"Escape Tsunami For Brainrots!\" has 350K concurrent players. It looks super basic but kids LOVE it.\n\nOnce your game is up, it runs itself. Kids buy in-game items, game passes, and premium features with their allowance money (Robux). You cash out through Roblox's DevEx program. Blowing up as well is just ONE tiktok video.\n\nNot saying it's \"get rich quick\" but compared to other passive income ideas I've tried (dropshipping, print-on-demand, etc.), this actually has real earning potential with an audience that's EAGER to spend. \n\nHas anyone else tried this? What's been your experience? ",

My best way to learn is to pick one learn how to build a server that host a basic static website using Flask/Django, Nginx, and Gunicorn learn to build use AI such as ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude I recommend use search term prompts like \"Help me learn by providing instructional step-by-step on how to build a basic cloud instance for hosting a basic static website using Flask, Gunicorn, and Nginx.\" state to the AI that you want to use either AWS, GCP, or Azure I recommend the ones that's been the longest which is AWS or GCP and the AI will give you a solid instructional guidelines to follow and from there you'll learn the ins and outs and later start using other cloud platform and connecting them and run a robust architecture. \n\nI passed my certification 2 years ago for GCP, AWS, and Azure thanks to ChatGPT and Gemini I have 20+ certification in cloud platform and some from other known third-party such as CompTIA which cost me $500 per exams with 100+ dedicated hours of training myself. I now applied to several jobs using my experience in cloud plus showing them my past experience build a solid web-application while showing people how it works, security, and managing since it has become my \"eye-catching\" performance that employers loves to see that I know the security and managing sides of cloud. Another thing you shouldn't never ignore is the use of or integrating with AI almost all of my projects are using API models from OpenAI, Gemini, and Grok.\n\n\\---\n\nDo 10+ hours a day doing instructional guidelines from ChatGPT on building a solid website and later you'll start honing that skills and build more solid experience. When you've become experience that you can build a solid architecture without AI's help start learning on how to properly manage and secure that system you have create by using other cloud platform's other services or use other cloud platform in my case I use both AWS and GCP management services for a robust database and storing my secret keys.",

The barrier of entry is so low, which means insane competition.\n\nBut on the other side of this, there’s now insane demand for monetization experts who know how to turn views into money without leaving a lot on the table.\n\nIn my opinion, learning to build funnels puts you in a golden spot in this influencer era. Finding clients is easy. I’ve had to raise my prices to the point where I won’t even consider anything under $10k/month base fee + commission.\n\nAnd you don’t have to work only with influencers. I built a funnel for a California construction company that sells Chinese backyard rental houses (unit price \\~$300k), and now they’re selling around 5 units per month. My 5% commission on that is not bad.\n\nI guess ask me anything. Just wanted to throw this idea out here for those still starting out and standing at a road fork of choosing a business model.",

High-ticket stuff like your $300k units, B2B SaaS, or done-for-you agencies can all afford $10k/month + performance if you can prove ROAS in 60–90 days.\n\n\n\nIf someone wants to follow a similar path, I’d focus on: 1) one traffic source (YouTube ads, TikTok ads, or SEO), 2) one funnel type (lead gen → sales call or webinar → call), and 3) one niche where you can stack 3–5 case studies fast.\n\n\n\nTools-wise, I’ve bounced between GoHighLevel for the plumbing and ConvertKit/Klaviyo for email, plus Pulse for Reddit to mine real objections and language from niche subreddits so the funnel copy hits harder.\n\n\n\nMain point: specialize in turning attention into revenue and you’ll never struggle to find work.",

      "selftext": "I honestly feel like an idiot for quitting my facebook page three years ago. At the time, I thought the golden era was over, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The best time to start was then, but honestly, the second-best time is right now while everyone else is distracted by other platforms. I really think this is one of the best things to hop on in the next few years.\n\nI’m currently sitting on three pages, two in the animal niche and one on spirituality, and the momentum is starting to get crazy. Two of them already reached 11k and 13k followers just by hitting the first viral content. My roadmap for 2026 is to scale this up to 8-10 pages and hit $10k a month in 99% automated passive revenue.\n\nMost people don't realize that Facebook is the best platform for automated content because they don't actually care if you're posting via a third-party app or the official page. As long as the content is good and people are engaging, they wll push it. Thats the secret sauce that lets you automate the whole thing. Have not seen that on any other platform.\n\nI’m currently running a super simple ad strategy where I spend about $3 a day per page on simple page like ads. Goal is to get a new follower for under 1c. I’m consistently hitting between 1 and 2 cents per follower now, which is not too bad. When you mix that cheap, targeted growth with high quality automated content, things just start to explode.\n\nMy current workflow is about 90% automated. I wrote a python script that uses openai api for the captions and fal ai for the images, so the content literally creates itself. As soon as the script generates the post, it automatically schedules everything across all my pages through crosspostify api so I don’t even have to look at it. I just find Python more convenient for keeping the whole pipeline from idea to scheduled in one place, though you could definitely do something similar with n8n or Make if you aren't a coder. Just make sure to post 8-12 pieces of content per day and look what works. It is literally easy as that, look what works for competitor pages and try it and adjust. repeat until viral.\n\nThe only thing I’m still doing manually rn is the reels, but I’m working on automating the video production side next. Once thats dialed in, I’m launching two more niches I’ve already scouted.\n\nThe end goal is to get every single page into the content monetization program to farm the revenue. Once the traffic is there, I’ll start bridging those followers over to a dedicated website with display ads to really maximize the earnings. If you’re looking for a legit passive income play for 2026 please have a look on that thing. i genuinely think this is the single best passive income opportunity right now..",

I was in the same boat during college and wasted time chasing those \"set it and forget it\" promises.\n\nwhat actually worked for me was mixing small active stuff that didn't need upfront money. I started with user testing sites like Testio and Utest, they pay decent when you get accepted for tests but it's competitive. then I added survey apps during dead time between classes, nothing crazy but it added up to like $150-200 a month without thinking about it too much.\n\nthe key thing I learned is you gotta stack a few small things instead of looking for one perfect solution. I use Babki for surveys and game stuff during commute or when I'm just sitting around, it's newer so less crowded than the big platforms. also tried Prolific but that one's harder to get into now as a new person.\n\nfor actual passive income tho, that's a longer game. you need either money upfront or skills to build something first. don't let anyone sell you a course on it, most of that info is free on youtube anyway.",

Plus as a beginner, untrained to recognise translation pitfalls or know how to solve even common issues that you come across in translation, you are simply not a proper candidate for that size project, even if that was a real project.\n\nJust don't.\n\n If you are serious about finding such work, educate yourself by contacting local translators' associations, doing research on proper pay and proper project parameters etc. Translation is currently a minefield of low pay to no pay, so make sure you are not working for free nor for a scammer representating as a big legitimate company.",

So I can see why cost segs under 100% bonus depreciation is hyped but not “write off’s” in other businesses\n\nEdit: People are not realizing I am talking about the people who say “you can just write it off” about everything. I’m talking about the items that aren’t necessarily needed, or a new one is not needed but someone is wanting to decrease their tax bill. The math doesn’t make any sense.

Anyway, back in September this lady emails me asking if I could take her dead plants and turn them into some kind of preserved art piece for her wall. Like pressed flowers but for her crispy monstera that she killed. I honestly thought she was messing with me.\n\nBut she was dead serious (no pun intended) and offered to pay me $80 for it. I was like whatever, why not, had some saved money from Stаke set aside for random experiments anyway. Took me maybe 3 hours total including the framing. Posted a pic of the final thing on instagram just cause it looked pretty cool, got way more engagement than my usual posts.\n\nNext thing I know I'm getting like 15 DMs a week from people wanting the same thing. Turns out theres this whole guilt thing with plants where people feel bad throwing them away and want to \"honor\" them or whatever. Some interior designers started reaching out too because apparently dead plant art is having a moment??\n\nNow Im doing 20 to 30 of these a month at $95 each and honestly the margins are insane compared to selling live plants. No shipping stress, no dealing with weather delays killing inventory, and people are way less picky than with living plants. The community around it is also super engaged which helps with word of mouth.\n\nI still sell regular plants but this accidental thing is now my main income source and I barely advertised it. Just goes to show sometimes the dumbest sounding ideas are worth testing out.",

Live plants have spoilage, shipping risk, seasonal demand, and customers get upset when things die. Dead plant art has none of that. You're basically selling preserved inventory with unlimited shelf life.\n\nAlso \"dead plant art is having a moment\" is the most 2024 sentence I've read in a while. But honestly it makes sense - people spend money on house plants because they want the aesthetic, not because they love caring for living things. You're selling the aesthetic without the maintenance burden.\n\nCurious how you handle the sourcing - are these all customer plants or do you ever buy \"dead stock\" from nurseries? Feel like there might be an angle there if nurseries are throwing away inventory anyway.",

A business that ranks well on Google might be invisible when someone asks ChatGPT for plant upcycling services. We track this visibility gap through CoreMention (https://coremention.com) - it shows how different sources perform across traditional search vs AI search.\n\nFor niche businesses especially, understanding both channels matters. AI search often favors businesses with clear value propositions and active community presence, which you can build organically.",

It was after COVID, I had money in the bank. I went out to live my dream - I travelled/surfed full-time. Did not give a fuck about anything.\n\nIt was the dream life. Now, 5 years later, I get hit with a huuuuge tax bill ($100k+) from a previous transaction (real estate). It's gonna wipe out a lot of my net worth, so I can't survive on SP500/BTC anymore as I did before. \n\nI now live in Mauritius (world-class surf/kitesurf spot) but I can't legally work here. Also, it's a shit market to work in. The population is 1.3M and people are poor. It's paradise leisurely but a nightmare economically. BYOM (Bring your own money). \n\nI'm only legally allowed to work in Canada or online. \n\nI need to pull income again and refill my net worth. \n\nNo idea where to start....\n\nDo I become a plumber? I basically need to restart my career...\n\nI can start my own business again but honestly don't know what field. I haven't been in Canada for 5 years and now I'm visiting. I feel lost. I have no network....I'm a surfer dude who just came back into the Matrix after a 5-year hiatus. ",

They had the advantage of knowing both cultures and markets. So a few examples could be to marketing for travelling to where you’ve been, or even guided stuff where you live now. Or import unique or special goods from where you are to Canada (stuff that you think Canadians would pay for). So basically think about what a Canadian could use your local knowledge or contacts for, and try to capitalise on that. That sounds like your best advantage right now if you can’t stand going the normal route of just returning home and going to trade school. \n\nYou also have the story of your travel life and how you got there, surely that is worth reading about.\n\nGood luck mate!",

You started businesses and sold them so you have some skills. If nothing else anyone can work in customer service/account management and make enough money to live on. If you are trying to make a little more money, sales is a great way to go. Sales of anything, companies are always looking for sales people and your experience starting businesses, traveling the world by yourself and fun adventures is going to make you a magnet to sale anything. Plus most businesses don't care too much about experience and qualifications when it comes to sales. If you have some money set aside, you could do more independent sales like real estate, insurance, etc.\n\nHowever, if you and when you can think out of the box, you have what few people have. Experience starting a business and selling it for enough money to temporarily retire. Adventures traveling the world in wonderful exotic places. Surfing skills. You can do so much with that. I don't have the exact answer and you might not either until you just do something with it. Consult with people who want to find the best places to surf. Start travel trips for landlocked urbanites who want to go to warm places and learn to surf while they are there. Teach surfing online. Teach surfing in person. Create a product online (book, course, instagram, youtube, blog) that gives info on travel requirements (visas, passports, money exchange, etc.) best places to stay, best surfing spots, how to find quiet spots not covered with tourists, best places to get surfboards, etc. Create you own travel related company by contacting places you frequented while surfing and set up referral fees for travelers who you refer to their place of business. Write a book about your experiences from building businesses, travel, learning to surf, all the way to getting hit with tax bill. The options are endless and just doing one thing will lead to another, but there are a million guys out there working as laborers or in offices but very few who did what you did, so make the most of that.",

If you work in a rural/slow area most of you time “on” is down time anyway and you can do whatever you want on a laptop computer. The pay alone is nothing crazy but it’s great benefits and steady pay to keep you afloat, and a schedule that accommodates working toward something else, all the while contributing something very real to your community. If you love it and you just want to go down that path it opens doors to becoming a firefighter/paramedic, Physicians Assistant, or various types of nursing - all high paying flexible jobs that can be taken anywhere whatsoever.

The mistake would be treating this like a total reset instead of a reentry.\n\nIf you’ve exited businesses before, that skill still compounds. I’d avoid anything that locks you into location or long retraining. Plumbing is honest work, but it’s a decade play and ties you to one place. You need cash flow faster and flexibility. What usually works after a gap is problem driven work, not identity driven work. Pick a narrow, painful problem you already understand, ops, support, logistics, growth, and sell outcomes, not a “startup.” Consulting, done right, is often the fastest bridge back to income while you rebuild signal and network.\n\nYou’re not behind, you’re just between chapters.

It can always work better faster, harder later.\n\nI stocked up a war chest for almost nine years.In my business. I just mastered the mundane and kept doing what was working.And didn't get fancy.\n\nWhen the new trump trade war started, I was able to drop a massive amount of capital on massive amount of inventory and avoid our tariffs jumping from the 25% we had been paying since 2018, to 100-150%.\n\nThis allowed us to keep our pricing the same. Last year, one of the other two manufacturers that supply our niche of commercial truck parts globally was absorbed by the other. Both were already 50% more expensive than we are, even though we have twice the profit margins. Once they completed the buyout, the company raised its prices another thirty to forty five percent!\n\nWe gained 127 new customers the first month after the buyout. For the last three months, we have seen double digit new customers coming on board. \n\nThe company that bought our other competitor is bleeding customers for this niche every day.\n\nWe recouped every dollar that we spent though.We did burn through what was supposed to be 24 months of inventory in just over 12. We have the cash flow, though, and we've already got 2 more inventory orders on the water that should arrive any day. Today I had five new customers.Come on board that were bleeding off of the competitor. \n\nWe did our first price increase in ten years on january first for 7%. We still dominate our market in pricing. And quality, and we still have almost 80% net profit margins with the new inventory lines coming in.\n\nI'd like biographies. Founder's Podcast is excellent.

The tension between scaling and safety is real though.\n\n\n\nOne thing that helped businesses I know navigate this: automating the processes BEFORE scaling. If you automate your core workflows now, you can actually scale revenue without proportionally scaling headcount or risk.\n\n\n\nThink about it - if you can automate 30-50% of your operational overhead, you can take on 50% more volume without hiring, which means less fixed costs and lower risk while still growing.\n\n\n\nBefore you and your cofounder compromise on strategy, map out which parts of your operation could be automated. That usually gives you a third option: scale with existing team + automation. Gives you growth without the risk exposure you're worried about.\n\n\n\nJust a thought, but it's honestly how a lot of profitable businesses approach scaling without burning cash.",

I couldn't tell who was good until months of cash had already burned.\n\nhere is what i wish i knew earlier:\n\n**Too much jargon is a red flag.**\n\nGood developers explain their work simply. \"I added the password reset button. Now users get an email when they click it.\" While bad developers hide behind complexity. \"I refactored the auth middleware to handle session state.\"\n\nIf your dev leaves you more confused at the end of the conversation, that's not because you're dumb. It's because they're either hiding something or they don't truly understand what they built\n\n**Commit frequency matters even if you can't read code.**\n\nGo to your repo on GitHub. You don't need to understand the code. Just look at the patterns.\n\nIf you see multiple commits per week with clear messages like \"feat: added user profile page\" then that's good, while one giant commit every 10 days labeled \"updates\" or \"fixes\" is bad .\n\nKeep this as a rule of thumb: Small frequent commits = good habits. One giant weekly commit = poor planning or last-minute cramming.\n\n**\"Almost done\" is almost always a lie.**\n\nIf your dev always answers to your queries about what happened with : \"almost done\". they're either stuck and won't admit it, or they're actually not working.\n\nGood devs give specifics: \"password reset is done. email templates will be done in Thursday. Then I'll use two days to test.\"\n\n**The best developers push back on your ideas.**\n\nThis always keep surprising me. The devs who keep saying yes to every request are actually the worst. They weren't thinking, just billing\n\nThe best developer I ever hired regularly told me my ideas were wrong. \"That feature would take 6 weeks. What if we did this simpler version instead?\"\n\nThat's what you want. You don't want a mindless machine, but someone that will help you and correct you if you're wrong.\n\n**Weekly demos reveal everything.**\n\nStop accepting status updates. Ask your dev every Friday for a working demo of what he is working on. Even if it is still unfinished.\n\nGood developers love showing their work, but the bad ones always have an excuse for why they can't demo yet.\n\nBy the time your gut tells you something is wrong. You've already lost months.  \nWhat i found the most helpful is getting visibility earlier not until it's obvious\n\nWhat signals do you look for when evaluating developers? Curious what's worked for others here.",

Who are the exact set of users who badly need your solution right now!\n\nOnce you have the ideal customer persona, list down all the marketing channels you can use to find them- wherever they hang out- be it reddit, manual out reach on linkedin or even meta/google ads! once you have this list, your goal is to run time boxed and budget constrained rapid experiments in parallel to find out out which marketing channel works best for you at this stage.

I needed high enrollment to pay myself so I had to figure out a way to get more parents in the door. I tried a bunch of different things but what I landed on that had the biggest impact was making my business the happiest workplace it could possibly be for my employees. I learned to be kind but firm, both with parents who were being unrealistic or difficult and also with my employees. They learned that I wouldn't allow them to be mistreated. I created amazing benefits, including higher pay, bonuses for hitting benchmarks, and more time off. I insisted on a positive culture and got teachers behind it so that it started to grow organically. By creating a workplace that my staff had never experienced before, they worked harder. They understood that to get the kind of benefits and environment that I had created meant that they also had to follow my rules such as always smile at parents when they dropped off or picked up, going the extra mile for a child or a parent, extra training, do the right thing, be nice to your coworkers, come on time, etc. Once I had all that in place, the parents naturally noticed the difference. My team was friendly and happier than anything they saw in the preschool industry. They noticed that their children loved coming to school and were truly cared for. They told their friends about it. People started driving long distances just to enroll with us. I was able to open a second school and fill that up fairly quickly because of my practices. In the child care industry, just getting 85% enrollment is really good. Before I sold my business, I consistently was at 95%+. People didn't want to unenroll during the summer months because they didn't want to lose their place. I had staff who was with me for 5, 10, 15 years. I am very proud of what I accomplished. By treating my team like gold and holding them to a higher standard, the sales took care of themselves.",

It’s been two years, I’ve gone through depression, anxiety, not having enough runway, running out of money, almost becoming homeless, suicidal thoughts, no personal life, investor rejections, tons of refining my idea, solution based on problem space. Even at the initial stage, my customers insulted me and told me to shut down the project because it was a waste of time, money and resources. Later, I did self validations, improved myself, my idea, solution and learned more about my customers.\n\nPlease share your dark experience of being as a founder.",

Everyone tells you to work hard and that you have to grind because your competitors are grinding harder than you, but nobody ever talks about the importance of balance and not feeling guilty for not working hard all the time. I hope if any new founders are reading this, that you make it a focus to take care of yourself first and foremost, and never lose sight of what makes you happy, or your hobbies. The grind is not worth it, at least in my eyes. There are better ways to achieve your goals through a slow, methodical, and well thought out plan of attack.

I underestimated the amount of work I’d have to put into this business, and as covid hit I thought to retire my parents so I took all fiscal responsibility at home. The stress impacted my relationships, broke up with my gf at the time, business was not picking up as anticipated so I thought of a way to scale my business with minimal turn around/money by creating a Airbnb like platform for my niche. \n\nIt worked I was increasing my top and bottom line and was in talks to getting other businesses onboard the platform with all the tools to facilitate the same scaling capability. I figured there’s a market and tried raising funds for it to scale the platform as I knew there was a decent demand from my research.\n\nBut I was delaying the inevitable, and macroeconomic conditions overpowered me. I got wiped out. Went deep into debt trying to make everything work, so I had to sell my home, businesses and was literally left with nothing. \n\nOn top of that you see true colours of the people (friends and family included) around you and realize there was no one of substance and it was all people that seemed like they were happy to see the carnage unfold.\n\nYeah I took a major risk on myself and I’m proud of that, it was a Hail Mary but it didn’t connect.\n\nI was borderline homeless and even went 3-4 days at a time not eating because I had no money. Now I’m slowly but surely getting back on my feet now (ironically fractured my ankle on New Year’s Day 2026 lol). I’ve been working on my new startup for the past year, have a few pilots and working my way to success. I’m not new to bootstrapping to traction, initially it may have seemed daunting now feels like a walk in the park. The results won’t show overnight but I’m used to it. \n\nNo risk no glory, never give up, the pain is striking but the journey is priceless. You’ll just learn to bear the pain seamlessly, making the journey more tolerable.

However, even after months of actively thinking about it, I still struggle to identify a problem that makes me confident enough to say: “this is the one worth investing my time and energy in.”\n\nHow do you personally go from “I want to build something” to identifying a real problem worth solving?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights.",

I don’t look for ideas, I collect annoyances. Stuff that feels slightly broken, inefficient, overpriced, confusing, or just dumb. Especially things people complain about but then accept as normal. Those are gold.\n\nProduct Hunt is useful, but not for copying ideas. I look at reviews and comments instead. What are people mad about. What are they paying for but still unhappy with. What features are missing. That’s usually where the real opportunity is, not the product itself.\n\nAnother big shift for me was realising that most businesses are not brand new problems. They’re better, narrower, cheaper, simpler versions of existing solutions. Uber didn’t invent taxis. Notion didn’t invent notes. They just made something people preferred using",

Wouldn't people pay a premium for that? Or, extra virgin olive oil pressed by the monks living in a remote monastery in Southern Europe with a production capacity of a few hundred litres a year. Just two ideas I came up with now.\n\n3. Social good. If I'm paying the same price as the big supermarkets and customer service is nothing special and the product is commoditised, I'd choose to spend my money with a company that invests in social good. Spend 1% of your revenue planting trees or installing solar panels or donate the money to funds fighting against big corporations exploiting animals/people/the planet.\n\n4. Underdog. As above. Some people choose to support underdogs. Tell your story. Why are you building this business? If the service/product is good, I will always support the underdog. For some of my purchases, I don't spend money with the bigger guys. Don't want to make the 1% richer.\n\n5. Package things. Anyone can buy a hammer, nails, a screwdriver, screws, etc... cheaply.

Equity in the whole company vs just a route/book of clients.  \n\\- How profits are calculated (gross vs net, what expenses come off the top, owner salary).  \n\\- Decision rights (pricing, hiring, equipment purchases).  \n\\- What happens if one of you wants out (buyout formula, non-compete, client ownership).  \n  \nAlso: measure your real contribution. If you’re the one doing the work + retaining customers, you have leverage.  \n  \nTactical tip: build your own “operations dashboard” so you’re not negotiating blind. I’ve seen people use Manus (AI no-code web builder) to set up a simple full-stack internal tool: a database of clients, job history, and margins, with authentication so only you/your boss can access it. You can even add Stripe integration for deposits or recurring plans if you ever spin off. Having clean numbers (not just “I hustle hard”) changes partnership talks.  \n  \nNot legal advice, but if the offer is real, a fair contract + transparent bookkeeping protects both sides and keeps the hustle from turning into resentment.",

I'm always trying to catchup and I think don't have a good enough system to stay on top of them, or at least just being able to find necessary details quickly. So eager to hear what's working for more experienced entrepreneurs here",

Longtime Members of an industry usually know what’s going on, it’s part of the job. If you don’t have such knowledge, learn. Read up and ask questions about everything related to the job. \n\n2. You can certainly buy a small and stable business, but that’s expensive, and you are already locked in to what it is. Both have their places.\n\n3. It’s not a deal breaker, but having industry experience already lets you get started faster and less learning curve. \n\n4. Going too big too fast, having big dreams and ideas. You don’t need 10 tools or AI this or optimization workflow that. I have 3: CRM, Inventory, Accounting. It’s boring for a reason, business comes in and business goes out, no fancy projects. \n\n5. That’s called sales. These boring business are the hunting ground of the sales team. In person meeting, networking events, and a lot of cold market (90% in person for me) \n\n6. It means you could take an entire month of work, and you wouldn’t be able to tell what you did on any given day. Clients appear, you do your thing, the end. No stressful projects to get done or new features. My business hasn’t fundamentally changed what it does in 7 years. I have no plans to add any features to what I do for the next decade.",

Just pick any business that already exists, and do it slightly better,  show up on time,  offer good service,  be consistent.   That's really all it takes to run a good business.   You don't need to re-invent the wheel.  Think garbage removal,  window cleaning, roofing company, landscaping, moving company etc.\n\nDon't buy an existing business or take on a huge loan.  You find something that you can start out small at.  Ideally something you don't need to to to school for like learning a trade (pumber, electrician).  Let's say garbage removal.   You start by working a traditional job,  getting your expenses really lean and saving up enough money to buy a big, cheap pickup truck.   You register a business, make a website, learn everything you can online from YouTube,  reddit,  books from the library about garbage removal and starting a small business.   You start social media accounts, hire a friend or someone on fiver to make you a logo.   You post ads on kijiji, craigslist, Facebook marketplace.   You get your first few jobs and get paid cash.   They leave you a good review.   You find a local business center that offers grants to small businesses and offers free classes and resources for local entrepreneurs.  You get a few more jobs.  You learn about how collecting and paying sales tax works and you get setup with quickbooks.  You design and print up door knockers and leave them on 1000 doors.  You try more sales and marketing things.   You get more work.   Eventually,  you have enough jobs that you can finance a big truck with a bin that you leave in their driveway.  You get bigger invoices.  Eventually you quit your full time job.   You keep working hard and growing.   You get so busy that you need to hire your first employee.  You get a 2nd truck etc etc etc.\n\nI studied business in school but it really doesn't translate to actually starting your own business.   You mostly learn by doing the thing. \n\nI am a self employed real estate photographer and i also run an online community for photographers to learn and grow.   All in,  i earn low 6 figures.  If i wanted to put the effort in,  i could do more sales, hire employees,  and build a small real estate media agency. \n\nYou just gotta start and take it one step at a time.",

My favorite is the 5 Ps of Marketing first developed by E. Jerome McCarthy in the 1960s. Originally he had 4Ps but I like the model where there are 5. \n\n1. Product: We know it is muffins. Now... what kind of muffins? What are your favorites? What are your friends favorites? What are easiest to make? What are hardest to make. As we get into the other Ps of Marketing, this answer might change. Also, what do you call the name of the company and what do you call the muffins? \n\n2. Place: This is really important for a muffin start up because it is a two part question: where are we selling the muffins and where are we making the muffins. If you go with a bakery model where the place you bake and sell are the same place, then cool. But if we don't have the money to pay for commercial rent then we need to think about other solutions. Many states have cottage kitchen laws that allow people to make commercial foods in their own home as long as a state regulator comes to their home and inspects the kitchen to ensure everything is commercial grade and up to state standards. Then you need to figure out where to sell them separately. This might be a weekend farmers market type deal where you sell on weekends. But selling at these farmer markets will incur material costs (we need a tent, tables, signs, cases to display muffins, bags, boxes, a point of sale system, etc.) and fees (pay for a spot in the market).\n\n3. Price: How much do we charge per muffin? How much do ingredients cost? If we buy ingredients in bulk; we can make more muffins cheaper but we have to make a lot of muffins. How many muffins per hour can we make?  If we are doing the farmers market, then we have to take into consideration all of the costs of manning a booth for a weekend and consider how many muffins we need to sell to cover those costs and ingredient costs and have a little left over for ourselves. \n\n4. People: Two parts to this question. Who is making and selling the muffins and who is buying the muffins. If you are hypothetically the muffin maker in question, great. But if you need help setting up and running the booth at the farmers market, you need to take into account how much their time is worth. This is also the time to think about your customers. If I were advising your business, I would take a field trip to the farmers market and check out the crowd. Are there a lot of people or are there not that many people. Do people skew younger or older? Are people buying lots of stuff or not a lot of stuff? Are they buying lots of baked goods or not a lot of baked goods?\n\n5. Promotion: This is the part I leave last because I think there is not a lot of point to executing on this part if the other parts above aren't figured out. But now that you know how much you should sell each muffin for, maybe you can do a special sampler muffin tray to let people try one of each of your muffins. You can hand out coupons for the next week so they can get 20% off a muffin order of 6 or more muffins if they come back. You can ask people at your booth to tag you on social media for a 10% discount on a muffin order. If sales are doing well you can allocate some of your revenue to advertisements and do a targeted tiktok ad in your 30 mile area to let people know that you sell muffins at the farmers market. If you make friends with another vendor, you can talk about splitting the costs of your tiktok ad budget and make one video advertising both you and the other vendor. It helps if you are neighboring stalls. \n\nThis is a lot of thinking for a \"simple\" business like selling muffins. That is because it is hard. People on YouTube who make videos detailing out how \"simple\" it might be are glazing over nuances that actually make the business engine go. Like I said earlier, as you make adjustments to one part of the marketing mix, other parts of the marketing mix will be adjusted. You have to keep doing these adjustments until it comes to an equilibrium. Then you can extract these findings and turn them into a plan. \n\nThe difference between a plan and a marketing mix outline like what was ideated above is an order of which thing you need to do first to get going down the path toward creating a sustainable business. \n\nIf there are specific questions you have based around a product/service you are investigating you should probably post about that and we can be of more help.",

I think it might have been produced by some government economic development committee.  Anyway, almost 15 years later I'm in my 3rd year of a business degree and I attended a seminar about entrepreneurship and they showed us the exact same video! \n\nI can boil it down for you. \nThere are three ways to get money to start your business. Number one save up. Number two borrow money from family/investors. Number three borrow money from the bank. \nThere are three types of businesses. Sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations. \nI feel like that video was equally valuable to me in the fourth grade as I was to me in university\n\n\nIt is shocking how closely your example of buying candy in bulk and selling it on the train illustrates how to start a business. It will blow your mind to find out that almost everyone at all ages is making it up as they go along. For example if you wanted to start a candy store instead of selling it on the train, you rent a space, set up utilities, buy the candy and start selling it in the store. It's almost exactly the same except you are paying rent for a store. \n\nI mean depending where you live there might be licenses and permits that you have to buy. But you do sort of make it up as you go along.\n\nFormalizing the way you do business by writing procedures and policies down, will allow you to grow your business by hiring staff. It will allow you to move from being the salesman on the train to being the guy that organizes the salesmen.",

Once you have a clear picture of how the business will make money it becomes necessary to define every process within your business that will result in you meeting your objectives of the business.

You must have a way to earn money while you allow the necessary time to develop, grow, and nurture your business. Most people will spend years and years punching a clock to help someone else realize their dreams, but then when they start a business and build a dream they give up in a year or two because the business has not gotten the proper traction that it needs. Plus there are a whole bunch of people in my life that did not support me having a business during the stages where it wasn't making money and I could not sustain living expenses. The thing is that I had to tell all the clock punchers to fuck off and stop projecting their working class views on me.

The passive company will continue to grow over time and earn me a nice passive income while I play, work, sleep, and just live. If the sales continue to increase and the overhead remains low, this company will surpass my other one and earn me a nice living.\n\nGo for it. You have nothing to lose.",

And I honestly believe one of the winning factors in this day and age is having an online presence. And that goes all the way on whatever you are selling, whether services or digital products or physical products. If you don't have an online presence, your business doesn't exist.\nIt has come to an extreme where you don't need to fully develop your company or product to get your first customer or client or user.\nSo, you don't need to overthink it or even need funding. It just requires you to notice a problem. Understand the opportunity within the problem and understand how the market speaks and addresses that problem and then just emulate them.\nThen, it then narrows down to building a system for the business you want to start. This gives you leverage that rewards you for less effort but with directed action and focus. So what it looks like is that you set one goal, you want to achieve in accordance to the business long-term priority. \nThen, you divide the actions that need to be taken to reach the goal. And categorise these into quarterly projects. Then, they also break the projects into monthly and weekly goals, then those goals again to 3 daily tasks,and then one metric to track as this will kill the need to seek motivation and the more clear you make it, the more leverage you get from the system.\nSo I would truly want to show you what the system looks like as it will be the biggest needle mover in your journey. But I am not leaving the link to it in here. But you are free to have a glimpse. I will leave the link on my profile",

Most platforms have export functions buried in settings. Set a calendar reminder monthly.\n\nDon't put all eggs in one basket. Even if 90% of sales come from one platform, having a basic presence elsewhere (your own site, a secondary marketplace) means you're not starting from zero if this happens again.\n\nDocument your account history obsessively. Screenshots of good standing, payment records, compliance with their TOS. When you do get a human on the phone, having receipts helps.\n\nThe \"suspicious activity\" flag is often triggered by stuff like logging in from a new location, sudden sales spikes, or even their own system glitches. Usually resolves but the lack of communication is brutal.\n\nHope you get it sorted quickly.",

I have several people I trade lead referrals with for various reasons that do the exact same thing I do and their existance makes my life easier.\n\nTLDR: If they value themselves appropriately and dont drag down the market I wouldnt care. If they undercut do not play that game it means they are failing in some area and desperate to get work, you will win in the long run or they will drop to a lower tier of clientele to continue existing and not be your problem anymore either way.

      "selftext": "I've been doing web development for about 4 years. Back in March I landed a restaurant owner who needed a simple website menu, hours, contact form, maybe 10 pages total. $2,500, signed contract, everything by the book. First month goes great. He's responsive, sends assets on time, compliments the work. I'm thinking this is the dream client. Then the site launches and the \"quick questions\" start. \"Can you just add a reservations button?\" Sure, 30 minutes, I'll throw it in. \"Can you make the menu downloadable as a PDF?\" Fine, easy. \"Can you add a little animation to the header?\" Okay, getting annoying but whatever. By month two I've done maybe 15 of these \"quick\" things. I finally sit down and add it up 12 hours of extra work. At my rate that's $600 I just gave away for free. So I send him a nice email explaining that future changes will be billed hourly, gave him my rate, even offered a discount because we had a good relationship. He loses it. Says I'm \"nickel and diming\" him. Says a \"real professional\" would stand behind their work. Says he thought we were \"building something together.\" I tried to explain the original scope was delivered months ago but he just kept saying \"it's the same website though.\"\n\nYesterday he left me a 1-star Google review saying I \"surprised him with hidden fees after the project was done.\" The thing that kills me is I don't even think he's being malicious. He genuinely doesn't understand that what he asked for was extra. In his head, he hired me to \"do his website\" and the website isn't done until he says it's done. I should have had this conversation after the second or third request. Instead I stayed quiet trying to be the \"chill\" freelancer and now I'm the bad guy. How do you even explain scope to a client who doesn't think in those terms? Or do you just avoid these clients entirely?",

          "body": "My solution to this problem with clients works every time.\n\nStep 1: have client send links to sites similar to what they want their site to look like and similar to the contents they envision. Tell them to group the links by (a) sites with color schemes they like, (b) with layouts they like, and (c) content and content organization they like.\n\nStep 2: set up a 15 minute zoom call to go through the sites they provide so you have an idea for layout, color and mending. Keep it to 15 minutes, you are training the client to be concise.\n\nStep 3: create 3 mock-ups. I call them mentally bare-bones, expected choice, and kitchen sink. But I describe them to the client as entry level business profile, typical feature informational website, and custom professional website. Price differential should be very wide, like $800, $2,200 and $25,000.\n\nStep 3: give them a process timeline and a build analogy. I use a home building metaphor which goes \"We first draw the blueprint, and you can make any change at that point such as different layout, menus, number of pages or sections, features, etc. Then we lay the foundation which is where we register the URL, build the menus (plumbing), lay out each page (rooms). Then we complete the look and feel with text and images (finish carpentry and flooring.)\" You do this to be able to say \"remember, i told you there is no charge to change the site layout during 'blueprint' phase, but we are now at the finish stage and the change you are asking for takes us back two stages, so it will be expensive to do this as we have to tear up the pipes and cement. I will give you a price quote for that change.\"\n\nThis works for me. When they jump to \"hey, we really need to add a blah-blah-widget\" you can say \"Great! That was one of the features I suggested in my proposal for a professional level site! Should I go ahead and give you a quote for that addition?\"",

The ideal solution would be not to bill on hours -- for **this** contract/website. *In his mind*, he didn't agree to an hourly rate, or sign off on menu items, so they feel like tack-ons, and he has no out but to settle on a subpar website. In his mind, it feels like being taken hostage -- he can keep paying more and more at a rate he didn't necessarily agree to pay, to reach a complete website; or he can accept a subpar website. Neither solution is really palatable to him, so maybe he felt no other escape but an angry review.\n\nSolution: In the next contract, either break down 'website' further into individual items (button == X, subpage == Y, copy edit == Z, ...) or just spell out the hourly rate for add-ons.\n\nFrom your standpoint, what you can do to recover those lost/unbilled hours is to charge a higher hourly rate on this next contract. So over time, you break even again and even go higher. But don't damage the client relationship by nickel-and-diming. You have a right to your time, but acknowledge his feelings, turn him positive by saying you'll do it for free **for this website** \\-- and then just spell out hourly rates or a menu of items in the next contract. You'll make a fan out of him and come out ahead, plus he won't leave that review.\n\nAt this stage, maybe you can ask for him to remove the 1-star review in that next contract.\n\nThis is how I've done it. I've been on both sides. His feelings are sound. So are yours. Just take the loss on this one contract, then apply your adjusted expectations to the next one -- or walk away. Think long-term. You want happy clients. Guys who are noisy 1-star reviews are also noisy in 5-star praise. So turn him into the 5-star guy by swallowing your ego, acknowledging his feelings, and then playing for the next contract, with much more specific breakdowns and a favorable hourly rate.

          "body": "You have to take the blame for this crusty situation.\n\n1. You need to take it as a learning lesson. You should have already, after 4 years, addresses the cut off time for included updates, and the cost for additional updates and the cost. Be clear about maintenance going forward. Ask if they want a pre-paid retainer or to do it by the item.\n2. You basically punished them for making updates and failed to provide CLEAR information about future updates. It can feel like getting nickel and dimed.\n3. You offered to do the work free - you started the problem.\n4. In consultations, I say something like: \"The website is done. You pay the final invoice. A month goes by and you want to update the site. Depending on what you need, the maintenance cost is this, this, or this. You can do it hourly, or purchase a discounted update pack for a group of changes, or a retainer for regular updates.\"\n5. If a client doesn't understand what's extra, that's a failing on your part. It needs to be in writing and it needs to be initialed and it needs to be communicated several times, and you need to get an answer on how they plant to manage the site going forward.\n6. You can offer a monthly update for XYZ dollars and it might include (5) updates and you list those updates. Major functionality like a reservation system with a mobile app, or getting DoorDash functionality, etc. All the updates requested above, I'd do in a monthly maintenance session for $55 - about 20 minutes of work usually. Adding a menu PDF is problematic, the menu changes, add a solution where they can make updates to the menu and a \"Print PDF\" is automatic.\n7. There are tasks as Webmaster that are included in their annual hosting/domain renewal - things like new email addresses, backups, restore, etc.\n8. I took a lot of lumps when I started my brand and web development company. Each issue with a client taught me how to be smarter with the next.\n9. I made a lot of areas self-manageable and offered to train them or an employee. I also included a user guide with easy steps to update a page or add a page.\n10. All these things they are asking for should have been offered anyway. Go ahead and add these items to your offerings for restaurants.\n11. I also make them complete an online form in their account, for requesting updates. They check boxes for what they want done, and it indicates \"included in current maintenance plan\" or \"additional fees\". If they go over a certain amount, it adds fees. One client dumped me because he wanted to text me at all hours and I told him I don't do business by text. Log in to his account and submit requests - there needs to be a record. He came back after a while.\n12. It sounds cliche, but an educated customer is your best customer - you have to educate them.\n\n**Good luck next time. As for the 1 star, if you're able to respond:**\n\n&gt;\" Nicks Cafe is a valued client and we are proud of the work we were able to do in launching their new web site. The contracted and paid web design phase was for 6 weeks. Once the site launched, any updates are billed either hourly or through a maintenance plan. Any errors or loss of functionality, we correct at no charge, but new pages, new features, or changes or deletions, are billed items. We apologize that the maintenance costs were not understood. We welcome the opportunity to make it right by offering a discounted 1 year maintenance plan. We have reached out to Nick with this offer.\"\n\nFigure out what deep discount you can offer to save your reputation and reach out to the client. For me, it's worth it to even give him a set amount of updates per month for a year at $100. The business you lose is infinite. Be sure to come up with a pricing plan for 2027 that keeps him happy after you see what he requested in updates this year. I also use clients like this to try out new features I install free. Then when it's tested, I can actively market it and point to them as a LIVE example.\n\nA lot of people are telling you to snark, but it's partly your fault for not being clear. If you value customers who put food on the table, be kind, but be firm and professional. My business was 99% word of mouth. Not one client in my portfolio would say a bad word about me. Do whatever it takes to make it right - within reason - and fine tune your contracts and communication about price.\n\nIn freelancing, when there's a problem, take a look a how you failed. If it's not in writing, it's you. DM me and I can share some CRM solutions that help you manage clients and costs and requests.",

          "body": "You’re not dealing with a “bad” client — you’re dealing with a **missing boundary**, and that’s incredibly common.\n\nMost non-technical clients don’t think in terms of “scope.” In their head, they didn’t buy *pages* or *features* — they bought *peace of mind*. So every new idea still feels like “the same website” to them.\n\nWhere things usually go wrong (and you already spotted this) is silence. Each “quick favor” silently resets their expectation of what’s included. By the time you bring up billing, it feels sudden to them — even if it’s completely reasonable.\n\nWhat’s worked better for me over time:\n\n* Define the scope in **plain outcomes**, not technical tasks launch-ready site with X pages; post-launch changes billed.\n* Introduce the concept of paid changes **early**, even if you waive the first 1–2 small ones. That sets the mental model.\n* Frame it as a **process**, not a fee: “After launch, all changes go through a small change request so nothing breaks.”\n\nAs for avoiding these clients — you usually can’t. Restaurants, small businesses, first-time website owners often think this way. The real filter isn’t the client; it’s whether you enforce boundaries *before* resentment builds.\n\nThe Google review hurts, but honestly, most experienced freelancers reading your story will recognize it immediately because we’ve all learned this lesson the same way.",

She also sold them for a dollar more than I did, she also sold out and I just feel so beat down. We eat lunch with a group together and she was talking about how she’s such a great entrepreneur and since she’s so successful she’s going to sell every single week, and talking about her future flavors and I kinda just stayed silent.. what am I supposed to do with this situation? :(( should I keep going or just don’t bother selling again?

          "body": "I'm so sorry this happened to you. It feels devastating, doesn't it?\n\nBut here's the thing. She can only copy you. The smart entrepreneurs (YOU!) \\*create\\* - everyone else copies. When you have time, come up with unique recipes. Also, don't call the cakes by the same name you saw in the book or video you learned it from: \"brand\" it by calling it something unique. So maybe a ginger carrot cake becomes a SpiritedAd Sugar 'n' Spice cake (add a tiny grating of nutmeg for a hint of a flavour) - unless she's got a good palate, she won't be able to reverse engineer that and make knock offs.\n\nBut really, in a way, you should thank her. You proved that a market exists for the mini cakes. She ran with the idea and proved you were selling too cheap, that the students would happily pay more for the exact same thing. So next time, price it at HER price. DON'T think going cheaper is the solution. MATCH her. \n\nThat way, she's got to either keep upping her prices to keep feeling superior (she isn't - you guy have a captive audience in school, is all), or she's got to come up with her own ideas.\n\nAlso, here's the reality: you baked the mini cakes because YOU had an idea. Guess what - that makes \\*you\\* the entrepreneur, not her. She's simply a copycat. \n\nIf you enjoy baking, keep doing it. You'll get better the more you practice. And baking, once you understand the basics, is SUPER versatile. You can come up with SO many ideas, she'll always be following, not leading.\n\nOther things you can offer: cookies, protein bars (these can get expensive, so watch out), brownies (with things like sweetened shredded coconut in them for texture, or made with condensed milk for an extra \"undefinable something\"), macarons, those rolled no-bake sweets, and more. Even mini-cakes with chopped up candy bars inside can be a differentiator - again, with your own branding, she won't know what you made!\n\nThe bottom line is, you're the trail-blazer. Keep up with your grades for now, and keep experimenting with baking (and with cooking!). Keep selling to your schoolmates - ignore what she's doing, because there's room for both of you. Instead of looking at her as competition, just note what prices she's offering her goodies at and go equal. NEVER compete on price.\n\nBy the time you graduate high school, you'll have proven to yourself that you have the chops to be a successful business. Focus on things like understanding your margins (how much it costs to make the goods compared to the total you get from selling a batch - that profit margin is what helps you do things like pay taxes, insurance, building rent, etc. as an adult with a business. (If your family has a Costco membership, go with your parents the next time they head to Costco, and check out what fun ingredients you can put in your goodies.) Take business courses if they're offered at school, otherwise, definitely look into YouTube videos - there's SO much you can do even as a high schooler. \n\nRight now, for example, you can literally use AI to start a small business online and get super successful and she won't even know about it. Go to ChatGPT, tell it what your strengths are, and ask it for suggestions for businesses you can start with no cash, no fancy equipment. There are kids making money even just creating social media videos for businesses: a real human showing off how they use the companies products is WAY more appealing than a formal ad. If you do this, look up videos about making UGC for Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.\n\nSorry this is so long - your post just struck a chord. I remember being a teen and wanting SO much to do something big. You've got great instincts. Trust them, keep going. You're going to be a superstar one day!\n\nMy DMs are open if you get stuck and just want someone to bounce ideas off of!",

Is there a unique icing that would take your competitor a long time to figure out? Maybe a cake filling so good that can only come from you that will make yours sell out first leaving your rival with unsold product? I have been in the food industry for decades and have my Professional Chef certification, and I have owned restaurants, so I know all about competition. The real key is coming up with something your competitors either can't do, or do not know how to copy what you have. \n\nYou should probably go to one of the Culinary, or better yet, Baking reddit subs and ask how to make your mini cakes more desirable than your competition. It's sometimes quite simple really, little things like just adding a little more water to the mix so the bubbles are bigger, or using lard instead of butter can make a huge difference, even using a different sugar like powdered instead of regular, or mixing two different ones like brown sugar with powdered. \n\nYou get the idea, and I'm sure with a little research and experimentation, you can leave your competitor in the dust. Now, go to one of the Baking subs and ask questions and do not tell a soul what you are up to because you know how gossip works. This is an easy hurdle for you to overcome and will learn a lot in the process. I have done things like this and it is not a marketing or price point problem, you just need the better product that cannot be copied, and it won't be as long as you tell nobody about it.

Over those past 35 years we have grown more than we ever thought possible and accumulated over 20,000 consigners. We have been doing great and actually had are best year ever this year. We also boast a 4.8 on google reviews so I’m pretty proud of what my mom has built. Recently a women made a post on a local facebook group with about 26,000 members slamming our store, saying we are rude, didn’t take her clothes, etc. While we do love constructive criticism this post was full of lies and complaints that are all adressed in the contract are make every consigner sign before bringing anything in. The post blew up with tons of angry people complaining about how we were to picky and didn’t take there clothes. If anyone has been in the consignment business you would know how picky you have to be bc space is limited and extremely valuable. Anyways she denied signing any contract in her post which was completely false as we physically have a copy of her contract with the signature dating all the way back to 2014. On top of this she used credit on account multiple times meaning she knew she had an account in order to use the money in it. My question is how to handle the situation. Publicly out the woman with evidence of the lying or let it brush over. ",

I once took a used mattress on consignment that turned out to have a big stain on it after I unwrapped it for a buyer (he still decided to buy it, although I significantly discounted it for him at that point 🤢)\n\nOver the years, I grew more selective as a business because I had to. Most people could care less if you waste your own time and money trying to sell stuff that they just want to recoup some money from, but it obviously matters to you a lot more than them. I explain to people that don’t understand why I won’t take everything that I make the same amount of money selling ten $10 items as I do a single $100 item (and one requires 10x the amount of effort, literally). \n\nI’d assume this is the same way with selling clothes. You know your market best and can only fit so much in your store, so you have to pick items that your buyers are willing to purchase from your consignors, as you really have two different customers as a consignment business. \n\nAnyhow, I hope this may help you / others understand why good consignment businesses are so selective. It really comes down to supply (of things that people want to sell… which is overwhelming at times) vs demand (of things that people are willing to buy secondhand for good prices, which constantly changes). \n\nGood luck OP!",

If this lady has already demonstrated an oddly targeted vendetta toward your mother’s store, I’m not sure a “politically / delicately correcting the record” post will quash things. \n\n In my opinion, I think this may require a 1-2-punch. By this, I mean that you start with a post that doesn’t engage her head on and is educational in nature as many other comments here describe. Examples have included how the store &amp; its contracts operate but doesnt get into a game of dispute &amp; debate the Karen’s allegations. \n\nPart two is having your finger on the trigger for a corporate litigation attorney. I know it sounds intense but you said it yourself, this person has a following and it’s stirred others to voice other negative opinions too. You mentioned that you have a signed contract from a decade ago, I’m curious if there is any type of dispute resolution clause within it. If it doesn’t have one, you may consider sending a cease and desist directly to her since one may be able to argue that she is guilty of libel. It’s not even puffery, you guys have years of data to know what sale should look like so if there is a hit to revenue, you could try to draw a connection to her for damages. \n\nBefore you do any of this, weigh the options and use your best judgment of the situation to determine if it’s worth going this route. Sometimes, the quickest way to resolving bs like this is by demonstrating you won’t put up with it. This isn’t make-believe Tik Toks, this is your mother’s legacy (that happens to be a cash flowing business) and that needs to be protected. \n\nAlso, look this person up in the public criminal records (city, county, state) and local civil record to see who they rally areas. I’ve sometimes seen that getting into tiffs with local businesses is something that people make a career off… just being a professional complainer. It’s sad but true lol. \n\nIf you have an attorney or have the money to hire one (a nasty letter and some research should likely be a few grand for this situation) then you may want to consider it. \n\nAnother more tactical approach  is to have a one on one conversation with her where you can catch her off guard (and likely not recording the conversation) and just hear her out. I’ve noticed over the years that these people are angry about something in their life and more lonely than anything else. If you’re just someone who hears them out and makes them feel seen, a lot of times they will calm down after they get it all out. \n\nBest of luck.",

You run a service business and the margins should be very high, compared to selling products which involves cost of goods.

Could it be that you're paying that one employee too much and you don't have enough business to justify hiring them?\n\nBut let's say you do spend too much on supplies, then you should reassess your cleaning process.  You shouldn't be using a pre-mixed bottle of cleaner, you should be buying in concentrate and mixing it with water.  And I've seen professional cleaners who say using a ratio of more water and less cleaner is actually better for cleaning.  Also, are you washing and reusing those microfiber cloths?",

And friends/family usually don’t “get it” beyond generic encouragement.  \n  \nA few things that helped me:  \n  \n\\- **Find one operator friend** you can be brutally honest with. Doesn’t need to be same industry—just someone who understands cash flow anxiety and decision fatigue.  \n\\- **Recurring peer group** (monthly mastermind, local chamber, industry Slack). The consistency matters more than the group size.  \n\\- **Make decisions visible**: I keep a “decision log” so I’m not re-litigating the same worries at 2am.  \n\\- If you have the budget, a **therapist/coach** who has worked with founders is underrated.  \n  \nSmall practical tip: loneliness spikes when you’re stuck in reactive mode. Anything that reduces chaos helps.  \n  \nI actually built a tiny “client portal” with **Manus web builder** so customers can submit requests, I can track them in a **database**, and they get **notifications** when I respond. It’s not about tech for tech’s sake—it just removed a bunch of constant pings and gave me breathing room.  \n  \nYou’re not broken for feeling it. This part is just not talked about enough.",

Last year I finally decided to stop helping other brands grow and try building something that was actually mine.\n\nI didn’t quit my job or anything dramatic. This started as a side thing. My routine was pretty fixed: finish work around 7, grab takeout, sit on the couch, laptop on my knees by 9. That was my business time. At first it felt kind of exciting, like I was stealing time back from my day.\n\nThe idea itself was simple. Products I already understood, suppliers I’d worked with before, nothing fancy. What surprised me was how emotionally exhausting the small decisions were. Naming the brand took me three nights. Pricing made me second guess my entire career. I’d tweak product descriptions at 1am, wake up the next morning and hate every word. After making all those product related decisions, I kind of stalled for a while. I kept questioning whether I could actually run an online store at all. But I’d already put in a fair amount of time and money, so backing out didn’t really feel like an option. I don’t know much about frontend stuff, and hiring someone would’ve been another expense, so I just figured things out on my own. I learned to use Genstore to build a pretty rough first version of the site and then started doing some basic promotion on social media.\n\nThe real punch came after launch. Friends would say “wow that’s cool” and then no orders. Or one order, followed by three days of silence. I’d refresh analytics more than I’d like to admit. Every small cost suddenly felt loud: packaging, transaction fees, refunds. \n\nWhat I didn’t expect is how lonely it feels. At work, if something flops, it’s a team problem. Here, every mistake feels very personal. If a product doesn’t sell, it’s not the market, it’s my judgment. Some nights I honestly miss just clocking out and not caring.\n\nI’m still running the shop. It’s not huge, it’s not freedom, and it definitely hasn’t replaced my income. But it changed how I see small businesses. From the outside it always looks clean and aesthetic. From the inside it’s a lot of quiet doubt, tiny wins, and arguing with yourself at midnight.\n\nSo how others here deal with that mental side. Not the logistics or tactics, but the constant second guessing. Does that ever go away, or do you just get better at living with it?",

I also add an updated exclusivity clause for the new tenant so they don't need to worry about me renting out to a similar business.\n\nSo my contract is pretty pretty binding and breaking lease triggers a payment of the remaining months of the lease, but I feel like our pricing per square foot is VERY fair and since everyone knows what they are getting into up front, people are always interested.\n\nAlso, I've only had 2 tenants move out. The first because the people hired by the tenant just weren't pulling their weight and the tenant wanted to be an absentee owner (of a new business 🙄) and the second because they fulfilled their 3 year lease and did well and wanted to move to a larger location (who I was super happy for).

Common area maintenance, property taxes, insurance… it adds up and can fluctuate.  \n\\- **Build-out / TI costs**: even “turnkey” spaces often need electrical work, lighting, signage, paint, plumbing tweaks.  \n\\- **Permits + inspections**: depending on your city, you’ll pay fees you didn’t even know existed.  \n\\- **Utilities you assume are included**: trash, water, gas, HVAC maintenance, sometimes even pest control.  \n\\- **Repairs vs. replacements**: leases can push HVAC repairs onto you (and HVAC is where dreams go to die).  \n\\- **Signage rules**: landlord approval + city permits.  \n  \nIf you’re trying to keep from getting blindsided, build a spreadsheet with “one-time” vs “monthly variable” and ask the landlord explicitly what’s excluded.  \n  \nOne thing I did that helped: I used **Manus web builder** to make a simple internal “lease tracker” web app—just a form + **database** for invoices/quotes, renewal dates, and contacts, with **notifications** when stuff is due. Not fancy, but it kept me organized and reduced the “surprise” factor the second year.",

I don’t hate marketing, I hate the _constant treadmill_ of “be interesting on demand.” What helped me was reframing it as ops:  \n  \n\\- **Batch one day/month**: film 10 short clips, take 30 photos, write 10 captions. Schedule everything.  \n\\- **One format, one platform**: pick the easiest thing you can repeat (before/after, FAQ, quick tip). Consistency beats novelty.  \n\\- **Reuse**: one longer piece becomes 5 shorts + 3 posts + a newsletter snippet.  \n\\- **Lower the bar**: “good enough” content that answers customer questions often outperforms polished vibes.  \n  \nAlso: if you’re relying on social for leads, it feels extra punishing because your work disappears in 24 hours.  \n  \nA workaround is to push people to something you own. I used **Manus web builder** to set up a simple site with **lead collection/management** (quote requests), an FAQ, and an **AI chatbot** that answers common questions when I’m offline. It also does **AI-powered SEO optimization**, so those same “boring” questions can rank on Google and bring traffic without me posting daily.  \n  \nSocial becomes the amplifier, not the engine.

Looked at Xero and QuickBooks but they seem really expensive and complicated for what's basically just a matching problem. Been researching simpler options found some platforms like Vivid Money that apparently do invoicing and banking together so payments would auto match since they're in same system but don't know if that actually works or just marketing speak.\n\nDoes anyone use tools that automatically match payments to invoices or am I missing something obvious here?

Invoice matching is one of those tasks that feels “simple” until you’ve lost a Saturday and realize your brain is now spreadsheet mush.  \n  \nA few ways to reduce the pain:  \n  \n\\- If you use QuickBooks/Xero/etc, check whether your bank feed rules can auto-match by vendor + amount + date window.  \n\\- Standardize vendor references: require invoice # in the bank transfer memo (or use virtual cards per vendor).  \n\\- Move vendors to **ACH + auto-pay** where possible; fewer manual exceptions.  \n\\- For the stubborn cases, set up a lightweight intake: every invoice gets uploaded into one place the moment it arrives.  \n  \nIf you’re even a little technical (or willing to prototype), building a tiny internal tool can help. I’ve seen people use **Manus web builder** to create a private “invoice inbox” app with **authentication**, a **built-in database** for invoice metadata (vendor, due date, amount), and **notifications** for “unmatched after 7 days.” It won’t magically connect to your bank by itself, but because Manus supports **code export**, you can later wire in Plaid/CSV imports or whatever your bank supports.  \n  \nThe goal isn’t perfect automation—just turning 47 manual matches into 5 exceptions you actually have to think about.",

The issue isn’t volume, it’s payments not being tied to invoices.\n\nOnce clients start paying multiple invoices in one transfer (with no references), spreadsheets turn into guesswork. That’s normal, not a personal failure.\n\nThe real upgrade is closing the loop between invoicing and payments so matches happen by client + amount + timing, not whatever text a client decides to type. Tools that link invoicing with bank feeds or payment links drastically cut this work, even if you still approve matches.\n\nIf weekends are disappearing into calculators, that’s usually the signal it’s time to let software handle reconciliation, not go faster manually.",

      "selftext": "I’m 28 and I’ve been working for about a year and a half as the only assistant for the owner of a small but high revenue entertainment and business management company. It’s just me and her. No HR, no backup, no real systems. On paper it looks like a solid job. I make around 72k a year, I have autonomy, and I’m exposed to finance, payroll, taxes, and high profile clients. In reality, I am completely burnt out and wake up most mornings with a pit in my stomach.\n\nI handle almost everything. Paying company and client bills, payroll, reconciling endless bank and credit card accounts, handling physical mail and deposits, dealing with IRS and state notices, and putting out constant fires that pop up with no warning. Over time the workload has increased a lot. We onboarded new major clients, migrated banks, and are still using outdated systems that do not scale. None of that came with more support or clearer processes. The expectation is always to just figure it out. When something goes wrong, it turns into a personal issue instead of a systems issue.\n\nRecently I tried to have an honest conversation with the owner about getting help, improving processes, and talking about the future. She had previously told me that one day I could take over or buy the business, so I asked what that would even look like. She told me she has no succession plan, no long term plan, and no intention of changing how she runs things. The conversation quickly turned defensive and blame focused. It became very clear that we have completely different ways of thinking and working. I left that meeting realizing I have lost respect for her leadership and I do not see a future here.\n\nFor context, I am not afraid of hard work. I graduated college in 2020 with a bachelor’s degree in business administration. Before this job, I worked in high end real estate sales at a brokerage that even had a Netflix show, but I left because the culture and status games were extremely toxic. Before that, I worked restaurant jobs, grocery stores, manual labor, home inspections, and even admissions at a major health system. I stayed at every job for over a year and I have always shown up and done what was asked of me. I am proud that I have been able to handle this level of responsibility at my age, but I am realizing that responsibility without support is not growth. It is just burnout.\n\nRight now I feel stuck. I know I cannot do this long term. It is affecting my mental and physical health. At the same time, I am scared to quit without another job lined up. This role is so custom built that even a standard two week notice feels unrealistic. My current plan is to stay professional, emotionally detach, do what is required, and quietly start applying elsewhere while I am still employed.\n\nI am looking for outside perspective. Is it reasonable to job search while mentally checked out like this? How do I frame this role to future employers without trashing my current boss? Are these red flags that mean I should leave sooner rather than later? And has anyone else been in a small business role where everything falls on one person, and how did you get out?",

(not that burnout is good either way but you know what i mean).\n\ntotally start job searching. If you feel bad about leaving them, which you dont have to feel bad about--work is work, you can give them 2 weeks notice (after you have a new job contract signed) where you stay on and help them transfer your tasks to a new person or to themself.\n\nas for how to frame it without trashing your boss, just list all your roles/responsibilties neutrally.

While these methods can work, they often require a lot of manual effort. That’s where [WebIeadr](https://webleadr.pages.dev) comes in. A platform where web designers, developers, SEO specialists, and similar professionals can easily find and contact web design leads such as businesses without websites, in just a couple of clicks, along with many other features (check the website to explore all of them)!\n\nWebIeadr offers a one-time, credit-based system: **$12 for 100 business leads**. No subscriptions or recurring fees: pay only when needed. Credits stay in your account and can be used anytime, with options to buy more as needed. For example, if 40 out of 100 leads lack websites and 15 use third-party services (e.g., Facebook), and you secure just a mere 3 clients with basic sales skills, you could earn around $2,000. Your cost? Just $12\n\nThe bottom line is that WebIeadr offers an extremely quick and efficient solution to find web design leads in just a few clicks and **call them in just one click of a button**. From there, all you need to do is apply your sales skills to convince them that having a website is a worthwhile investment for their business.\n\nKnow a web designer, developer, or SEO specialist who could benefit from this? Please share this post with them. They’ll thank you later!",

      "selftext": "\nHey all — looking for outside perspectives on a deal I’m evaluating.\n\nI’m looking at acquiring a single-location gas station + convenience store with the real estate. It’s in a small town (~10–15k population) on a main arterial road doing about 20k+ vehicles per day.\n\nHigh-level numbers:\n\n~$2.7–$2.9M in annual revenue\n\n~$275k–$300k EBITDA\n\nAsking price implies about a ~3.7–3.9× multiple including real estate\n\nBusiness has been operating 20+ years\n\nSemi-absentee owner\n\nFinancials are corroborated (tax returns, fuel statements, etc.)\n\nTanks are modern and environmental reports are clean / current\n\nWhat stands out to me is the revenue mix:\n\nFuel ≈ ~80% of sales (50-60k/mo)\n\nTobacco ≈ ~10%\n\nLottery ≈ ~5%\n\nIn-store ≈ only ~5%\n\nThe building is relatively large, but only a small portion is currently used for the store — there’s a lot of unused space that could potentially be converted to expand food, beverages, or other higher-margin items.\n\nFrom what I can tell, everything checks out so far. The numbers reconcile.\n\nAppreciate any feedback or red flags I should be thinking about\n\n",

I have a staff of 8 full time employees. They’re all awesome and we do gorgeous, inspiring, impactful work. But I’m frankly exhausted. I’m tired of feeding the revenue monster every month to meet payroll, insurance, and other overhead. Our steady clients for the most part are lovely people with great missions. But they’re getting their scopes continually cut. There are a few who tend to try and take advantage. And I have to be on top of them to make sure they don’t. Navigating health insurance this year has been a nightmare. I wake up in a cold sweat at 4 am wondering if we are going to need to cut staff. We were in a position to buy a building last year but that money is dwindling because no one is willing to sign contracts. I am doing my absolute best to keep the pipeline going but people are just reluctant to sign anything right now. I was a creative director / art director at a multinational agency before I started this agency making well into the 6 figures and I’ve been paying myself half of what I made when I went full time on the business 7 years ago. I’m exhausted and not sure if I can keep going…not sure it’s worth enough to sell (our gross revenue last year was over $800k), or if I need to pair down and just freelance a few of the clients we have contracts with and cut everyone else loose or just shut it down and see what else is out there…so my question Redditors who owned a business, when do you know it was time to walk away?\n\nEdit: employee count (mistype)\n\nEdit: Thank you for the thoughtful comments. Yes I have gotten a lot of value out of what we’ve been able to accomplish especially as it relates to doing good work for the communities we serve. More than money really. But unfortunately still need money to live. I know the margin looks whack. But the location we’re in is a lower cost of living and most of my employees take well below market value in their salaries because of the nature of the work we do. They’re still paid living wages and benefits, but I recognize that their salaries are lower. And I’d really love to pay them more but the clients aren’t multi billion dollar brands themselves. What prompted this post was a client emailing to say they can’t pay for a few months but can they lump hours in the spring and I about lost my mind. To those recommending a pivot, absolutely. We’re looking to move into some other categories for stabilization. It’s just not happening fast enough to keep up with payroll. I recognize I may need to adjust the composition of our staff, but in this economy it’s making my heart hurt to have to do that.",

Even if you wanted to sell the business, you would have better luck with the same revenue numbers and smaller employee count. \n\nI'm sure there's a lot more to your business than what you've written here, but just going off of this information, the only way your margins make sense to me is if your employees are taking unusually low salaries for marketers/designers in the US, or if you are confident your pipeline will really pick up in the next couple of months.\n\nOutside of that: you've been running this business for 9 years! How was it in Year 2? Year 4? Year 7? Take a second and think back on how you felt at all of those points. If it's been 9 years of thankless grinding, maybe selling is the way to go. If you've found the journey fulfilling up to this point, there's a good chance you'll continue to find it fulfilling once you've steered your way out of these storms. \n\nYour lifetime earning potential running a small agency like you have been is probably never going to square up favorably with a corporate job, but you've been doing this for the last nine years regardless. There's got to be a reason for that, and it's up to you to take a long hard look at yourself to figure out if it's a good reason or not and what needs to change for you to be happy with where you're headed.\n\nEdit: I have a relative who does marketing and design for local interest groups and nonprofits.

Has anyone here moved away from static forms to these more utility-based lead magnets?

This way I could see what the company charged, I got the benefit of seeing a completed project with progress photos and a good description of the work done. \n\nThis gives me an idea about what my similar project could cost while building trust in a company. \n\nIt's a lot of work, but gaining qualified customers should be a priority vs just getting random RFQ clicks. \n\nIt would be amazing if companies that build websites and marketing campaigns explained good metrics and KPIs vs the bullshit metrics and KPIs that small businesses have been trained to rely on for determining if their campaigns are successful or not.\n\nEdit to add: I built websites and online apps for 28 years for marketing agencies. It always pissed me off to hear the stakeholders given metrics about \"time on site\", click thru rates that don't matter, and page views as metrics that meant a campaign was successful. They mean shit to be honest. Then there was that phase where every bit of content had to be within 3 clicks of a home page. Like seriously WTAF? Properly indexing your content into appropriate buckets and having a logical hierarchical structure is more important than shoehorning disparate content wells next to each other confusing both search engines, your internal search, and the end user about the actual context of a page or section. I wish more agencies were honest about KPIs and how they actually matter to the end result.",

          "body": "The tipping point math is straightforward: what's your hourly rate on client work versus the hours spent editing? If you're billing $150-200/hour for consulting and spending 10 hours editing a video, you're effectively paying $1500-2000 in opportunity cost per video. Even a $500 editor is a massive arbitrage.\n\nThe quality tier that makes sense for B2B educational content is probably $150-300 per video. You don't need motion graphics or fancy effects, you need clean cuts, good pacing, and professional audio. The $50 freelancers on Fiverr are hit or miss and the revision cycles eat any savings. The premium agencies are overkill for 8-10 minute educational videos. Our clients doing similar content usually land in that middle tier with a dedicated freelancer they've built a relationship with.\n\nThe finding process that works: post on Upwork with a specific test project, review 5-6 editors, pay for one video from your top 2-3 candidates, compare results. Once you find someone good, lock them in with consistent work. A freelancer who knows your style and preferences gets faster and better over time.\n\nThe ROI question you're wrestling with is real but probably backwards. You're not making YouTube money yet because you're producing at unsustainable volume. 2-3 videos monthly is the minimum for growth, and if that pace burns you out, you'll quit before the channel gains traction. The outsourcing cost is what makes consistency possible.\n\nThe weekend time is the real cost. You started a consulting business presumably for some autonomy, not to spend every weekend editing videos.",

It's just going to take time, lots of learning curve, healthy failures, and most importantly: bootstrapping/spending savings without income replacement before I generate revenue. \n\nWould love to hear from folks who were recently in a similar situation (i.e., went all-in on a business without having one already started as a side hustle + are in their first year of it). \n\nAny positive stories to share?

Do to this a side hustle wasn't really an option, so it was go all in or don't. \n\nIt's been an interesting time, and I'm glad I made the jump.  It's not been stress free, there have been multiple issues that made me stop and wonder if I made the right decision.  But you stick it out, adjust, and make it work. \n\nRemember there is alot that goes into running a successful business besides actually doing the work.  There is bookkeeping, advertising, taxes, networking, ect...  If you are like me and are doing this solo, you are on your own. It doesn't sound like a ton, but when you're flush with work it stacks quickly.  \n\nBe detail-oriented.  It will help with multiple aspects, especially when doing your books. \n\nDo NOT underestimate the cost of insurance. Not just for the business, but your health insurance as well.  Last year I paid over $25k for my family's health insurance, its fucking expensive. \n\nThere is ALOT that goes into it, but what you get out is worth it. I was in business for 9 months last year and made about $200k in revenue.  My profit margin is about 60%, so I did ok.  This year I'm working on optimizing, growing my customer base and offered services, and investing in productizing an automation solution.\n\nIt can be done, but you have to have your heart in it.  That's important because there will be many times your head tells you to give up.   Good luck!",

          "body": "I did this but was joined with an ex-colleague of mine who I really trusted and was open to quitting to hop into entrepreneurship. We're very knowledgeable in our craft (working in tech revenue operations) so we opted to go into consulting versus building to have a steady cash flow.\n\nEach year we've learned a ton of things and almost had a 'theme' to it.\n\nYear 1 was about figuring out how to be a business. Figuring out our pitch, our messaging, our artifacts (eg. SOW), and all of that was all new. We also had the benefit of having a wide network with some translating to be some of first few clients. This allowed us to hire (and fire) people as needed.\n\nYear 2 was about learning how to execute. Still riding off of our network, enough word of mouth about us allowed us to hire more people. This was an interesting time since we were still figuring out how to deliver but also need to figure out how our team members can lighten up our load. At this point we were starting to feel like it was a business.\n\nYear 3 was about scaling and the harsh truths about business. Year 3 was by far the toughest. We've scaled to have a great team, we've gotten some good projects out but the reality is that nothing stays good forever. Client churns really affected us. Bad contracts that we signed got us on the hook for hard deliverables with minimal returns. Poor fiscal planning also caused us to close up shop. You have to remember that being business owners also means that multiple families now depend on your business for their livelihood -- which was personally for me was a very heavy responsibility and the real threat of closing up shop was a tough pill to swallow. We've made it out well after a very rocky start and blessed to live and tell the tale.\n\nYear 4 is where we're at now and the theme will be GTM (GoToMarket) this year. Our network is starting to dry up and we have to pivot to direct to customers at this point. As business owners, I can say that we've gone through quite a bit of battle scars. We're wiser but we still have lots to learn. This year we've beefed up our cash reserves to make sure we're able to navigate through hard times while preserving our team that we truly love working with. I personally am figuring out how we can perform marketing and be a good boss. We've expanded our skill sets to blend AI and RevOps together to actually build stuff that is valuable and not just junkware.\n\nSo it's been a wild ride so far. There were more rough times and rosy periods but the people you meet along the way, the experiences that you get exposed to, the hard decisions that noone else could make -- all these things, I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\nBe ready for a ton of sacrifices. It's not just time and effort. It's also relationships, mental and fiscal sanity.\n\nWould I do it again knowing what I know? I'm not sure. Financially, you don't get to see the returns until the end (I would 100% make more money working for a software company given my skill sets) so it's hard to say. Professionally, being your own boss is both awesome and a curse. Mentally, I've definitely developed to be more stoic but pretty sure that I'm also starting to develop bi-polarism lol. You'll miss your family, your friends, yourself.. but when you're there you also come to understand how privileged to have something that's growing regardless of the outcome -- so maybe the journey is the reward.\n\nGood luck to you brother/sister!",

          "body": "I'm just beginning my third year as a solopreneur.  As others have said, it's a blessing and a curse.  You are your own boss, you eat what you kill (for better or worse), you don't spend as much time with your family as you would like, you don't get paid vacation, etc.  Health insurance is beyond brutal, like eye-popping brutal.  But you are building something for yourself, and you can take on whatever kind of business you like, and do it in the way that you think is best for the client.\n\nI used to lead finance at a few high-growth, VC-backed startup companies.  I got fed up with the BS of internal politics and the pressure to run things differently than I wanted to.  So I took some time off to clear my head, then gradually stepped into doing \"fractional\" CFO work.  I get to do the kind of work I love, all day, every day, and I don't have to sit through hours of internal meetings that add little value.  My clients are SO appreciative of what I do for them.  I rarely heard \"thank you\" when I was in-house at my prior companies.  I hear it all the time now.  I've been able to leverage my network to get clients, I've never had to advertise or even solicit business in any way, people actually come to me via word of mouth, and my clients refer me to their friends unsolicited because I do great work for them and genuinely help them solve problems.  The work is way more rewarding than my old job, despite me actually performing the same job as before, just in a different way.\n\nIt took me about a year to replace my prior salary.  I probably could have done that faster but I wanted to gradually step into it and enjoy the early days.  It's been hard work but quite fun.  I haven't even leaned fully into it.  I've been approaching it as more of a lifestyle business where I'm less concerned with maximizing the opportunity and primarily just don't want to have a boss (though in reality it's FAR from a lifestyle business -- long hours and some stress when clients turn over and you need to replace them -- there will be good months and less-good months).\n\nI price reasonably, which works well for the smaller to mid-sized business I serve, but I don't compete on price.  My field is crowded with lots of subpar providers that often don't know what they are doing (posers), and the good providers are often both really expensive and inflexible in how they work with clients (e.g., they are often focused on providing scalable solutions with something of a one-size-fits-all playbook).  I fill the void in the middle, with more of an reasonable price + customized service to give people what they really want.  I could charge more for what I do -- possibly double -- and I will probably raise prices at some point this year, but not to anywhere near that degree.  Up until now I've just been so giddy about helping people and enjoying the ride of doing this on my own, that I haven't minded leaving some money on the table.  I have an abundance mindset: there's enough to go around for everyone, and at the end of the day, you can have anything in this world that you want, as long as you are willing to put in the work required to get it.\n\n  \nWishing you luck on your journey.  You've got this!",
