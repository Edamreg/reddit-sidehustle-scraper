      "selftext": "Ever make money purely by accident? That‚Äôs exactly how my first sale from a random keyword went down.\n\nI remember just aimlessly scrolling Etsy one evening, and bam, 'AI journal' started subtly appearing more often. It was totally off-script. On a whim, I fired up Canva, hastily designed a basic digital template, put 'AI prompts' on the cover, hit publish, and logged off. I didn't give it another thought.\n\nWoke up the next morning and ‚Äúcha-ching‚Äù, a sale. I couldn't believe it.\n\nThat minuscule sale was a profound wake-up call. It felt infinitely more satisfying than any elaborate scheme I'd meticulously crafted. No advertising, no aggressive marketing, no sophisticated funnel. Just perfect timing. I'd inadvertently caught a nascent trend before it swelled.\n\nAnd then, a few weeks later, it happened again. This time the keyword was 'coquette bow.' I'll be honest, I didn't even personally like that whole aesthetic, but people were absolutely losing their minds over it. So I just whipped up a few pastel prints, chucked them online, and literally forgot they existed. And boom, they sold too.\n\nAnd that, my friends, was the big 'aha!' moment. I'd spent months (probably years, honestly) torturing myself trying to be 'original,' constantly chasing ideas that literally no one was even asking for. But the money? It only showed up when I finally stopped guessing and just started actually paying attention to what people were already searching for.\n\nThese days, my time is way better spent just observing, seeing what people are saving, what they're searching for, what they're chatting about, rather than trying to brainstorm some brilliant new thing from scratch. And honestly? It's wildly freeing.\n\nSo yeah, that tiny 'AI journal' sale taught me the biggest lesson of all: the internet doesn't give a damn about who's the smartest or most 'original.' It pays the person who just shows up first, period.\n\nEver have a 'dumb' idea that made money, while your 'genius' projects flopped?",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI want to share something practical that actually worked for me. I‚Äôm not a tech person, not a full-time creator, but I found a simple system that started bringing in around $50/day after 3 months ‚Äî and it‚Äôs surprisingly doable if you stick with it.\n\nStep 1: Start small &amp; solve a real problem\n\nInstead of chasing trends, I looked at what I was struggling with ‚Äî too many side-hustle ideas, no clear plan.\n\nSo I built a tiny digital guide + checklist (think: what to do in week 1, 2, 3). That‚Äôs it.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt fancy, but it solved one pain point: ‚ÄúWhere do I start?‚Äù\n\nAnd people paid for that clarity.\n\nStep 2: Make your content look professional (without hiring anyone)\n\nThis was the key: I realized presentation matters. People buy what looks valuable.\n\nBut I didn‚Äôt want to spend hundreds on filming or models.\n\nSo I experimented with a few tools that let you create realistic human visuals. I used them to make lifestyle-style visuals and short explainer clips for my digital product.\n\nIt made my brand look way more trustworthy, even though it was just me behind the screen.\n\nStep 3: Focus on one platform &amp; post consistently\n\nI picked TikTok (because organic reach is still good in 2025).\n\nMy content formula was:\n\n¬∑ 3 videos per week\n\n¬∑ Each one showing a piece of the process (‚Äúhow I made my first sale‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat I learned about pricing‚Äù, etc.)\n\n¬∑ CTA: ‚ÄúFree checklist link in bio‚Äù\n\nNo editing team, no paid ads ‚Äî just showing small progress each week.\n\nStep 4: Monetize through simple upgrades\n\nOnce I got traction, I added two things:\n\n1.A ‚Äúpremium‚Äù version of the guide with templates and extra walkthroughs ($19)\n\n2.A small group for Q&amp;A support ($15/month)\n\nTogether, that brought me to \\~$2K/month in 3 months.\n\nNot crazy numbers, but real and consistent.\n\nStep 5: Things that helped me most\n\n¬∑ Don‚Äôt wait to look perfect. Post even if your setup is basic.\n\n¬∑ Pick one product and one platform, don‚Äôt scatter your attention.\n\n¬∑ Recycle content: one visual ‚Üí three clips ‚Üí carousel post ‚Üí blog.\n\n¬∑ Use AI tools to save time, not replace creativity.\n\n¬∑ Talk to your early buyers. They‚Äôll tell you what version 2 should be.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe online income space is loud right now, but there‚Äôs still room for small, thoughtful creators who actually help people.\n\nYou don‚Äôt need to build an agency or code a SaaS. Sometimes it‚Äôs just:\n\nidentify a pain point, make something useful, present it well, stay consistent.\n\nHope this breakdown helps anyone thinking about starting something small.",

      "selftext": "I‚Äôm just an average person who keeps burying myself in my life. Two hours ago, I suddenly realized I had been in Gap for two years, but my deposit hasn‚Äôt decrease much. This matter is quite interesting and beyond my understanding, so I'll do a self-reflection and record it.\n\nFeel free to discuss and share knowledge about making money.\n\nBefore deciding to take the Gap, I had some ‚Äúf\\*\\*\\* you money‚Äù money, enough to support around five years of personal life. I thought the Gap was necessary because at the time, the industry I was in wasn‚Äôt going to be my career for life, so I spent my youth searching for a second income source.\n\nDuring the entire Gap period, my requirements for myself were:\n\n1. Try different industries, drop old thoughts, and let new ideas develop.\n2. Don't be so focused on money-making projects, but more on choosing projects based on interest.\n\nThis is my understanding of the Gap: not fight for traditional success or development, but to give myself a period to look at the world and understand the world.\n\nThe following are the side jobs I did during my 2-year gap:\n\n1. Barista: I usually look for coffee shops I like in my city, and if there‚Äôs an open spot, I‚Äôll take a part-time job there. I prefer cafes with unique interiors and interesting customers, it makes work feel less tiring. But to be honest, this job can be physically demanding, and the pay isn‚Äôt great.\n2. Account Executive in Advertising: The reason I got into this is that my previous job was related to the ad industry, so I already had some clients who started reaching out to me for freelance projects. It feels a lot freer than working for a company, but it also requires more self-discipline and planning. I mainly handle client communication, content planning, and project follow-ups. It‚Äôs not physically exhausting, but it‚Äôs still pretty draining, classic agency life haha.\n3. Stocks &amp; Funds: My investment strategy is pretty simple. I use half of my capital for short-term trades in stocks I‚Äôm familiar with, usually making about 1‚Äì8% every two months. The other half goes into areas I‚Äôm less familiar with, but I try to analyze candlestick charts and follow the news daily to predict trends. Since I‚Äôm still learning, the results are pretty average, probably below what a rational investor would typically earn.\n4. Youtuber: I generate story outlines using ChatGPT and make videos with MagicLight. The workflow is pretty simple, which allows for regular updates, and it‚Äôs a high cost-performance side job. There were times I was anxious about data, but then I realized I couldn‚Äôt control the flow. Learning some tricks and posting on different platforms helped me create more engaging content. The results were decent, and I‚Äôm also exploring new ways to monetize this account.\n5. DJ: I have some friends who make music, and we often hang out at clubs together. I‚Äôve always been interested in making music too, but I never had time to learn when I was working full-time. So during my gap period, I studied some DJ basics and started working part-time at a small club I really like. I love the job, though I often worry I‚Äôm not good enough yet ‚Äî but surprisingly, it actually pays pretty well.",

          "body": "The problem with \"no money passive income streams\" is that people expect big enough passive income. Yes, there are some options for passive incomes. No, they are not more than a couple of bucks here and there.\n\nHowever, I'm with the mindset that 1$ I get passively is one dollar I don't need to work for, which is a win in my book. For example, cashback programs are a must. I use Trading212 because it's the best one easily avaliable to me (hmu if you want an link) but there are others out there. I use \"invest cashback\" option which would in theory generate more passive income over time, too. High yield savings for any money you will need soon but you don't need at the moment. I also have a post on my profile for Microsoft Rewords. Another one is renting formal clothing, I rent a dress through a local service. People get it for special events and then return it.\n\nDon't expect wonders from low effort no investmant incomes. However, they do stack up and are petter than nothing.",

      "selftext": "What 40 Days of Writing Taught Me\n\nwell.... we are starting off on the wrong foot. It is actually only 39 days but I didn't wanna wait another day to write this out as it's fresh in my mind. SO here we are on day 39 of writing everyday. 40 just sounds better in the header. It made you click didn't it? \n\nI‚Äôve written every single night for 39 days straight.\n\nAfter work. After my kids went to sleep.\n\nJust me, my laptop, and my thoughts.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned; the stuff that actually matters üëá\n\n  \n1. Don't wait to start. Start today and figure out what you wanna write about after writing a few. I still don't know what i wanna write everyday I am just writing. \n\n2. 66 days builds a habit - I see why this is true.. I'm almost at day 66 and I don't plan on stopping\n\n3. I write at night so it has been added to my routine. Which is nice because i never know what i'm writing about each night. \n\n4. No need to moitvate myself. Now i ust pay a game with streaks. Consisetency is now my motivations. \n\n5. I have had 5 or more days with no new subscibers. But i kept going and never stopped. \n\n6. I only focused on writing. Now the rule is simple. I can write anywhere else so tonight i'm doing this reddit post. But I have to write. No building a saas, new product etc. No more shiney obects just focus. \n\n7. Fail fast. I wrote about 7.... different topics the first 10 days. I learned quickly that i shouldn't focus on one thing. I stopped wasting time updating my landing page. Now i keep it very generic. \n\n8.  One idea = 10 posts (I wrote about it in an issue. bascially i'm taking 1 newsletter issue and publishing it on X, Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, Youtube, Medium, and a few others. \n\n9. Don't sell. The issue I wrote that said I wrote a book(even though it was a free one) didn't get open nearly as much as my average. Only 15% opened that email because they most likely thought i was selling them something. \n\n10.  Automate the boring parts, not the marketing parts.\n\n11. You won't  figure out what you wanna do unless you do a bunch of things. \n\n12.  Test your audience with content just like a comedian does. Track who visits your site and see what social channel brings in the most refferals then triple down on that one \n\n13. If you wanna write about the latest trending topic. Make sure to have it flow into your day to day writing not just talk about it only. Tell a story behind it. \n\n14.  My kids don't care about followers, they just wanna hang with daddy. Make time for those you care about.  Great businesses don't make you work 24/7. They let you sleep and enjoy life. \n\n15. Help others instead of being helped. It's alot more reasonable for people to see you are making an effort then asking for it. Message that famous person, give them suggestions without pluging your stuff. \n\n  \nHope this helps. Yea there is formatting errors and spelling errors but I'm not going back to proof read it. ",

      "selftext": "I‚Äôve put years into side hustles, and I‚Äôve come to realize they‚Äôre not as profitable as I once hoped. Over the years, I‚Äôve come across so many ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù schemes, and I can confidently say about 50% of them are scams. The crazy part is that the people buying into these schemes don‚Äôt always realize they‚Äôre the ones being sold. The sellers often pretend to be buyers, making it seem like a legitimate opportunity. But really, the whole thing is just one big scam where the buyers are sold the idea that they‚Äôre going to make money while the scam itself just keeps going.\n\nWhat‚Äôs worse is that the legit side jobs I once relied on are starting to disappear. Freelancing gigs that used to make sense are now being taken over by AI. More and more tasks are being automated, and it‚Äôs only going to get harder for those of us trying to make a little extra money.\n\nI‚Äôve found ways to keep some things manageable by using AI tools to streamline my work. Genstore is one of the tools that‚Äôs really helped me. I was able to get my store up and running quickly, leaving me more time to focus on what really matters like interacting with customers and getting their feedback.\n\nIf your side hustle feels overwhelming, this is where AI and humans really work well together. It‚Äôs about working smarter, not harder. AI has its limitations, but tools like these help you focus on the important stuff while saving you time and energy.\n\nBuilding a business is tough, but it also creates opportunities to find creative solutions that others might not have thought of. Finding ways to make your process easier can give you a serious edge. If you haven‚Äôt made the shift yet, now‚Äôs the time.\n\nLet‚Äôs keep the conversation going. If you‚Äôve tried something similar or are thinking about it, I‚Äôd love to hear about it. Adapting is key right now, and it‚Äôs one of the most valuable skills we can have.",

Over time it‚Äôs evolved into a student hub: I collaborate with local bars, student associations, and clubs to promote events, discounts, and deals.\n\nIt‚Äôs been great for influence. I‚Äôve built strong relationships with student faculty executives, local promoters, organizers. Practically¬†anyone who wants to reach a large audience of hyper-local university students ends up¬†working with me. But monetarily, it‚Äôs been pretty rough.\n\nMost clubs don‚Äôt do lump-sum payments,¬†they only offer commission per ticket sold, which isn‚Äôt very profitable. I basically become a¬†club promoter. I‚Äôm responsible for how well *their* event performs, even though my audience isn‚Äôt guaranteed to buy. University students are also pretty stingy, understandably. I‚Äôd be lucky to make¬†$50¬†on most weeks.\n\nI‚Äôve tried getting creative:\n\n* I've hosted my own little free¬†event (400+ people showed up, great for reach and exposure‚Ä¶ but exposure doesn‚Äôt pay rent).\n* Reached out to local restaurants/caf√©s to run promos, giveaways, or student deals. That's still in the works.\n* Tried small ad bundles for student organizations (stories + posts), but many expect free posts or ‚Äúinfluence for exposure.‚Äù\n\nAt this point, I‚Äôm trying to figure out:\n\n* Are there smarter ways to monetize a niche local audience like this without killing engagement?\n* How can I approach businesses (bars, clubs, etc.) in a way that actually gets them to take me seriously and pay?\n* Or is this just the natural ceiling for something like this; a fun passion project that won‚Äôt ever bring in real money?\n\nAny advice or examples from people who‚Äôve monetized similar local/community pages, or have any ideas or insight,¬†would help a ton.",

I am really glad you are doing so well with Instagram, Able to reach student and community.and aside from money part you really have strong connection with your community. Now for money part, it all depends on your creativity buddy. Your page is mostly of confession right. How about this, use subscription methods on Instagram for exclusive content like exclusive confessions or early bird tickets or promo codes for events only in exclusive content. And make sure to keep subscription price low like 5$ so more people can join. Your strength is in numbers. Try to convert maxium of them into your subscribers. Do more local one on one interview for content. You can even sell ebooks for student, create your own or affiliate marketing. And always think \"Why should I Pay\" Keep yourself in your followers shoe. Is it really good product/service that I should pay 5-10$ for this. Focus more in numbers. I used to be creative head in my college student counsel. It used to be fun. Let me know if you want to know more or creative ideas to monetize. All the best buddy.",

      "selftext": "Okay so... I know everyone's sick of \"I built a niche site\" posts but hear me out 'cause I almost gave up like 47 times lol. Started a niche blog in pet supplies (specialized gear for a particular pet type). Figured it'd be easy - write reviews, slap affiliate links, profit, right? Yeah... no.\n\nMonths 1-4: The delulu phase  \nWriting 2-3 articles per week. Checking Google Analytics every 5 minutes.  \nTraffic? Maybe 10 visitors/day, half were probably me refreshing üíÄ  \nRevenue? $23 over 4 months. I made more finding a $20 bill on the street lmao.  \nMonths 5-8: The reality check\n\nStarted actually learning SEO instead of hoping Google would magically find me. Turns out you can't just write and expect to rank. Who knew? (Everyone except me apparently)\n\nMonths 9-11: The pivot\n\nStopped trying to be an SEO expert and outsourced the heavy lifting. Used Fatjoe for link building 'cause spending 15+ hours/week on outreach to get ghosted by 97/100 people wasn't it.\n\nCurrent stats (Month 14): Traffic: \\~400 visitors/day. Revenue: $800-900/month. Time investment: 5-6 hours/week. Total articles: 67.\n\nWhat moved the needle:\n\n1. Long-tail keywords (not \"best dog food\" but \"best grain-free food for senior dogs with allergies\")\n2. Actual link building from relevant sites\n3. Product roundups convert way better\n4. Patience (nothing happened for almost a year)\n\nThe weird part? Articles from 8 months ago are making money now. You do the work today, maybe it pays off in 6-9 months. Or doesn't lol.\n\nMy advice: Don't expect fast results. Add 6 months to whatever timeline you're thinking. Learn basics, delegate the rest. Long-tail keywords are your friend. Track everything.\n\nAnyone else grinding on niche sites? I feel like everyone either gives up in month 3 or becomes a millionaire and I'm just out here in the middle lmao",

If more than one blows up, the payouts stack like crazy.\n\nI've been doing it myself and already pulled in some solid extra cash. If you want details, drop a comment and I'll share.\n",

I‚Äôm not just looking for quick cash or random gigs‚ÄîI want something that actually teaches me new skills and could potentially turn into a reliable source of income. There are so many options out there, from freelancing and social media management to digital marketing, e-commerce, and content creation, and I want to take the time to figure out which one fits me best. I like the idea of being able to work from anywhere and build something of my own while gaining experience that could open up new opportunities down the road. It feels a bit overwhelming trying to decide where to start, but I‚Äôm excited about the process of learning, experimenting, and finding something that not only pays but also keeps me motivated and growing.",

Traffic and trust come from posting valuable content regularly, whatever valuable means to your customer, financial or emotional. Storytelling helps you explain the benefits to the customer, meaning what benefit they might receive, based on past stories and testimonials. Typically what they receive is a personal transformation, a new self. Sales is a matter of testing, using authoritative framing and tone, and relating to the customer, to find out why they as an individual need this. Trust is important in sales, but that's already built up with content in the traffic funnel. Once they trust you and they're interested in the product, it's then a matter of getting them to convince themselves they need it, without being desperate or pushy.",

This strategy doesnt really teach you any useful skills in life or skills that you can add onto your resume. You also can not grind hours on it to get better, the money is there over time but you do not need to put effort in that time. It is called reverse split arbitrage. Basically when a stock reverse splits, sometimes they round up and in that round up you make profit. For example if a stock had a 1:10 reverse split, every 1 share you owned will turn into 0.1 shares (at 0.1 shares your original value did not change since the stock price is multiplied by this ratio, in this case 10) or if they round you up, you get 1 whole share back. If you want, im open to DMs if your interested in learning the risks/rewards to this method and how to actually maximize it.",

But unlike crypto pumps or sketchy affiliate schemes job boards solve a real problem (employers need hires job seekers want opportunities) and scale predictably.  \n\n### **Why Most Passive Income Ideas Fail**  \n- **Freelancing** Active income disguised as passive.  \n- **Crypto/Stocks** More gambling than a business.  \n- **Print on Demand/Dropshipping** Saturated and reliant on constant marketing.  \n- **Affiliate Marketing** Requires relentless content creation or paid traffic.  \n\nJob boards aren‚Äôt sexy but they‚Äôre **recession resistant automate friendly and compound over time**. My biggest board now runs on 2‚Äì3 hours of maintenance per week.  \n\n### **Want to Try It Heres the Hard Truth**  \n- **Pick a Niche You Understand** (e.g. \"Remote DevOps Jobs\" beats \"General Tech Jobs\").  \n- **Expect 6‚Äì12 Months of Grind** before meaningful income.  \n- **Monetization Levers** Job listings (highest $) ads paid newsletters recruiter partnerships.  \n\n**Question for You** Whats your most reliable passive income stream? (And if its crypto no judgement I‚Äôve been there.) Drop it in the comments!  \n\n*(No course to sell no hidden agenda just sharing what finally worked after a decade of trial and error.)*",

Basically, it means that if you apply for a Capital One card with a 680 credit score, you're stuck there permanently. It doesn't matter if your credit score is now 820 like mine is (basically perfect, 1% utilization with $90k max credit.)

I was pumped.\n* Weeks 2-4: Almost nothing. Kept improving features. Still nothing.\n\nI was doing everything wrong. I built, then waited for people to find it.\n\nAfter 3 weeks of barely any growth, I realized: Nobody knows this exists.\n\nSo I went all-in on marketing for one week:\n\n* Posted on Reddit\n* Twitter/X threads\n* Talked about what I learned building it\n\nResults from one week of marketing:\n\n* Users: 10 ‚Üí 25 paying users\n* Revenue: $75 ‚Üí $187.50 total\n* Now getting 1-2 sales per week consistently\n\nCurrent stats (after 1 month):\n\n* 25 paying users √ó $7.50 = $187.50 total revenue\n* \\~$12-15 per week in new sales\n* Costs: $10/month (VPS)\n* Time: \\~2 hours/week (support, updates)\n* Net profit so far: \\~$177\n\nThe product:\n\n* Tracks all your subscriptions in one place\n* Sends 7-day alerts before you get charged\n* No bank connection needed (manual entry takes 10 seconds)\n* Free for up to 3 subscriptions\n* $7.50 lifetime for unlimited (no monthly fee)\n\nWhy I built it:\n\nI found $150/month in forgotten subscriptions (old gym, streaming services, domains I didn't use). Figured I wasn't alone.\n\nWhat I learned:\n\n* \"Passive income\" isn't passive at first\n* Marketing matters 10x more than I thought\n* Consistent small income &gt; waiting for the big break\n* $187.5 feels WAY better than $0\n\nCurrent goal:\n\n* Get to $500 total revenue by end of year. That's \\~42 more users\n* Eventually this becomes truly passive as word spreads\n\nThe lesson: Your product doesn't matter if nobody knows it exists. I wasted 3 weeks \"perfecting\" features when I should've been talking about it.",

Make some touch cards w a QR code and the name n hand them out to people.  If you strike up convos at bars, grocery stores, many places have a bulletin board where u can post stuff like this.

That's *active* emotional and financial work.\n* **Real Estate?** You have to find the deal, secure financing, fix toilets (or manage the property manager who does).\n* **Niche Site?** You have to build it, write content, do SEO, and maintain it.\n* **SaaS/App?** You have to code it, market it, and handle customer support.\n\nWhat we're all chasing is **Leveraged Income**: The ability to de-link our time from our earnings. You do the work *once*, and it continues to pay you 10, 100, or 1000 times over. A blog post you write today can earn ad revenue for 5 years.\n\nCalling it \"passive\" implies no work. Calling it \"leveraged\" respects the (often massive) upfront effort.\n\nChanging my mindset from \"passive\" to \"leveraged\" helped me focus on building *systems and assets*, not just looking for a magic money button.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way?

I've taught English online, content moderation, worked for Real Estate agents, social media algorithm analysis and now AI training and language processing. (A lot of these jobs and companies aren't available anymore so I really can't guide people to remote work).\nMy college background was in microbiology.¬† None of these fields.\n\n\nI can't tell where AI is going to actually be useful for reducing human workforce jobs (it's failing a lot more than most people realize) but a lot of them will likely be those things people do remotely, such as chat support, coding, administrative tasks, etc. And it's not AI necessarily that is taking away work- it's the cheapskate CEOs wanting to charge the same amount but not pay employees. You'll be looking for those that want to pay for human produced creative output. And competition will be more intense for those jobs. But, as of right now, AI lacks the human aspect to art and creativity so most people can detect as being AI made. But as time goes on it's less and less apparent to the majority of people. There are podcasts, music, commercials and even üåΩ (yes, ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è even that) that is improving every month to where I struggle to tell the difference when a year ago there were major issues. YouTube is saturated with AI created animation and video editing, likely not the best focuses right now.\n\n\nIf you want to work remotely be prepared to do what's needed, such as customer service phone work, and look for project based jobs on some of the bigger sites that will give you experience in multiple fields. It may be contract work with no guarantees or benefits or it might be employee based.\n\n\nIf you want to do creative jobs then you may need to be flexible to working in office. You will be competing against AI and being flexible to working anwhere may be an advantage.¬†\n\n\nFor anyone looking to work remotely and are worried about AI I will say #1-that's a valid concern (I'm literally training myself out of a job) and #2- diversify what you do.¬†\n\n\nNot trying to be a downer at all, I do think AI is limited with artistic and creative fields but it's what the employers and customers will pay for, will they settle for unnatural but cheap but human made and more costly? AI will never have that spark that makes art like a human... Hell even the chatbots acknowledge that.¬†",

I‚Äôd been juggling my 5‚Äì6 job and my passion for building online stores, but I always told myself I needed more time, more knowledge, or the perfect idea before I could really start.\n\nEventually, I realized that ‚Äúwaiting to be ready‚Äù was just another way of procrastinating so I took action. I picked a niche, built my first store, and committed to learning through doing.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt smooth at all.  \nI tested multiple products, redesigned the store more times than I can count, and even faced a few failed ads. But with each setback, I learned something new  from how to identify better products to how customer experience impacts conversion more than flashy design ever could.\n\nThe real turning point came when I started collaborating with a few people who were more experienced than I was. Instead of trying to do everything alone, I learned to build around teamwork, consistent testing, and small daily improvements. That‚Äôs when I began seeing consistent sales and growth not overnight success, but steady, measurable progress.\n\nWhat I‚Äôve learned so far:\n\n* Execution beats endless planning.\n* Collaboration can speed up your learning curve dramatically.\n* Every failure hides a lesson  sometimes, that lesson is worth more than the win itself.\n\nI‚Äôm still learning every day, but looking back, I‚Äôm glad I stopped overthinking and just started.\n\nHas anyone else here experienced that shift  when you moved from planning to actually doing?

Here's the 14-day update.\n\n**Quick Recap:**\n\n* Niche: Plant-based milk alternatives (oat, almond, soy, etc.)\n* Site: Interactive quiz ‚Üí matches users with plant milk ‚Üí Amazon affiliate links\n* Built with zero coding experience using Claude AI\n* Started Oct 9, now Day 20\n\n\n\n**What's Changed (Day 6 ‚Üí Day 20):**\n\n**Content Strategy Shift:**\n\n* Pivoted HARD to SEO content\n* Published 8 blog posts in 14 days (2x/week cadence)\n* Topics: \"Best Plant Milk for Coffee,\" \"Protein,\" \"Weight Loss,\" \"Kids,\" \"Smoothies,\" \"Keto,\" \"Oat vs Almond,\" \"Is Soy Milk Healthy\"\n* All 2,000-2,500 words with proper Schema markup, internal linking, affiliate links\n* Added \"Latest from Blog\" section to homepage\n\n**Traffic Evolution:**\n\n* Week 1 (Reddit spike): 240 users\n* Week 2-3 (post-Reddit crash): \\~5-10 users/day (mostly direct)\n* Reddit experiment today: Posted golden milk recipe to r/veganrecipes (294 views, low engagement - learned I need photos for recipe posts)\n\n**Monetization:**\n\n* **$6.36 total earnings** (up from $1.69 two weeks ago! üéâ)\n* **8 items shipped** (up from 1)\n* **102 Amazon clicks** (up from 30 in first week)\n* **7.84% conversion rate** (clicks ‚Üí orders shipped)\n* Funny reality: People bought a winter jacket, 5x ultrasonic mouse repellents, a car phone mount... but ZERO actual plant milk üòÇ\n* Amazon's 24-hour cookie captures anything they buy, not just what you link to\n\n**Tech Updates:**\n\n* Added blog index page with green \"NEW\" badge system for latest post\n* Internal linking between all 8 posts\n* Updated sitemap after each post\n* Cookie consent + Google Analytics properly configured\n* All posts have affiliate disclosure boxes\n* Added homepage blog preview section (shows latest 3 posts)\n\n**Reddit Experiments:**\n\n* Tried helpful comment in r/vegan niche question thread (genuine engagement)\n* Posted golden milk recipe to r/veganrecipes today (learned: NEED PHOTOS for recipe posts)\n* Being careful not to spam or over-promote\n* Focusing on being helpful first, promotional never\n\n\n\n**Current Stats (Day 20):**\n\n**Content:**\n\n* 8 blog posts live (2,000+ words each)\n* Strong internal linking structure\n* All with Schema markup + affiliate disclosures\n\n**Traffic:**\n\n* \\~400 total users (lifetime)\n* \\~5-10 users/day (organic baseline post-Reddit)\n* Still waiting on first Google impression (sitemap submitted 7 days ago)\n\n**Monetization:**\n\n* $6.36 earned\n* 102 Amazon clicks\n* 8 items shipped\n* 7.84% conversion rate (solid for affiliate!)\n\n**Investment:**\n\n* Time: \\~27 hours total (12 hours week 1, \\~15 hours weeks 2-3)\n* Money: Claude Pro $250/year + domain $12/year = $262 total\n* ROI so far: -$255.64 üòÖ\n\n\n\n**What I've Learned:**\n\n**Content Production with AI:**\n\n* Claude AI is INSANE for content creation when you give it structure\n* My workflow: I write outlines, Claude writes full posts, I edit/approve\n* Can produce a 2,500-word blog post in \\~90 minutes\n* Quality is solid (readable, well-structured, properly cited with Amazon affiliate links)\n* Internal linking happens naturally when you prompt for it\n\n**SEO Reality Check:**\n\n* Google takes FOREVER (submitted sitemap 7 days ago, zero impressions yet)\n* Reddit traffic is a drug - spike feels great, crash hurts\n* Building content library while waiting for indexing\n* Playing the long game now (this is month 1 of a 12+ month play)\n\n**What Actually Matters:**\n\n* Quality internal linking (connects all 8 posts)\n* Consistent publishing schedule (2x/week is sustainable for me with full-time job + family)\n* Actually helpful content (not keyword-stuffed garbage)\n* Patience (everyone says 6-12 months to see real results)\n\n**The Weird Amazon Thing:**\n\n* People click plant milk links but buy random stuff\n* That 24-hour cookie is powerful - captures ANY purchase\n* 7.84% conversion is actually solid for affiliates\n* But you need TRAFFIC to make it work\n\n\n\n**Mistakes I Made:**\n\n1. **Relied too much on Reddit early** \\- not sustainable, just a vanity spike\n2. **Posted recipe without photo** \\- Reddit loves visuals, learned that today\n3. **Expected faster Google indexing** \\- reality = 2-4 weeks minimum\n4. **Didn't build email list** \\- should've started Day 1 (still haven't)\n5. **No returning visitor strategy** \\- everyone takes quiz once and bounces forever\n6. **Obsessed over analytics too much** \\- should focus on content instead\n\n\n\n**Next 14 Days (Day 20-34):**\n\n**Content:**\n\n* Publish 2-3 more posts (\"Best Plant Milk for Baking,\" \"Is Oat Milk Healthy,\" \"Cashew vs Almond\")\n* Target: 10-12 total posts by Day 34\n* Keep internal linking strong between all posts\n\n**SEO:**\n\n* Wait for Google indexing (should happen soon... right?)\n* Monitor Search Console obsessively for first impression\n* Optimize based on what ranks (if anything)\n\n**Traffic:**\n\n* Stop chasing Reddit spikes (not sustainable)\n* Focus on building organic foundation\n* Maybe experiment with Pinterest (visual platform, recipe-friendly)\n* Consider other subreddits for genuine engagement\n\n**Monetization:**\n\n* Add more affiliate opportunities in existing posts (protein powders, kitchen tools, etc.)\n* Consider email capture for newsletter (finally)\n* Track which posts drive clicks (protein? smoothies? coffee?)\n\n\n\n**Questions for the Community:**\n\n1. **How long did YOUR first Google impression take?** (I'm at 7 days post-sitemap submission, getting anxious)\n2. **Is 8 posts enough to start seeing traction?** Or should I hit 20-30 first?\n3. **Anyone else using Claude/AI for content?** What's your workflow? Quality concerns?\n4. **Tips for reducing bounce rate on quiz sites?** Everyone takes quiz once and leaves forever - how do I get them back?\n5. **That 7.84% conversion rate - is that actually good?** Or am I celebrating too early?\n\n\n\n**The Reality Check:**\n\nI'm in the \"valley of death\" right now:\n\n* Reddit spike is gone ‚úÖ\n* Google hasn't kicked in yet ‚ùå\n* Traffic is \\~5-10/day üìâ\n* Grinding out content hoping it pays off in 3-6 months ‚è≥\n* $6.36 earned vs $262 invested = -$255.64 in the hole üí∏\n\nBut honestly? I'm learning a ton, the content quality is solid, and I'm building something that *should* work once Google starts sending traffic. The hard part is the waiting and not knowing if you're wasting your time.\n\nThe AI workflow is genuinely game-changing though - there's no way I could produce 8 quality blog posts in 2 weeks without Claude. That alone might be the most valuable thing I've learned.\n\n**Site:** [**noncow.com**](http://noncow.com) (8 blog posts live if you want to check quality)\n\nHappy to answer questions about the AI workflow, content strategy, Amazon weirdness, or the emotional rollercoaster of month 1! üòÖ",

He had what I would call the solution to this problem which never really left me but I never decided to act on it until today.\n\nHe was living in shared flat somewhere in Berlin with 3-4 other builders in a apartment which had a big living room, workstations setup and was just living the builders life but not in isolation but rather with other like-minded people.\n\nNow I had that every now and then but usually I work from home, sometimes in a co working space but none of these environments are very socially Inducive. As entrepreneur/builder or whatever you wanna call yourself you already commit to a life where you spent most of your time working alone on your idea/agency/projects.\n\nI want to replicate what I experienced a couple of years ago. I created a \"manifesto\" where I describe that experience and my ask is simple: I'm looking for 1-2 entrepreneurs who are open to join this experiment. If you see yourself in this document then hit me up with the contact details seen in the link.\n\nP.S Seems like I can't drop a link here. DM me and I can send you the document.",

      "selftext": "2 years ago, a friend and I started an eCommerce brand and tried the same things as everyone else. We found a product, built a site, ran some paid ads on Facebook and TikTok, and thought we‚Äôd just scale from there. \n\nWe consumed as much content as we could on advertising. All of these eCommerce creators were saying the same things: \n\n‚ÄúYou just have to let the algorithm figure it out and keep spending, it‚Äôll start working eventually‚Äù ‚ÄúIf your ads aren‚Äôt working, it‚Äôs your creatives. Keep testing new ones.‚Äù\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch it! Every time you touch the campaign, it resets the learning phase.‚Äù\n\nBut man‚Ä¶ the results were all over the place. One week we‚Äôd have great days, then the next week sales were dead. Costs kept rising, and if we paused ads for even a day, the traffic dried up instantly. By the end of every month we‚Äôd be lucky to break even. Most of the time we were down quite a bit (I don‚Äôt even want to say how muchüòÇ). \n\nWe knew losing money like that wasn‚Äôt sustainable. Everyone‚Äôs running ads these days, so CPCs have gotten ridiculously high. So we switched gears and started focusing purely on organic traffic: SEO, blog content, community engagement, backlinks, the whole thing. It took longer to get going, but the traffic started stacking. And once it did, it didn‚Äôt stop. Even when we weren‚Äôt actively working on it, sales kept coming in from Google and blog posts we‚Äôd written months earlier.\n\nThat shift literally changed our business. We had consistent sales and after the Christmas rush we decided to sell that brand at the start of the year. Following that exit my friend and I took some time off. After a while we decided that we wanted to create something that helps other brands get the same kind of sustainable, compounding traffic we found with our previous business. \n\nSo we started [TheClickMill.com](https://theclickmill.com). An SEO agency that cuts through all of the crap out there and focuses on what really matters. Getting your brand more clicks and sustainable clicks. Clicks that don‚Äôt go away when you stop paying. Clicks from primed leads that are searching for exactly what you‚Äôre offering. Not some guy who‚Äôs video is getting interrupted by your ad because they searched your keyword a month ago on Google. The clicks we provide come from customers that want to buy what you‚Äôre selling right now.\n\nIf you‚Äôve ever felt stuck paying Meta or Google every month just to stay afloat, we feel you. If you want to break out of that loop and start generating sustainable sales that aren‚Äôt reliant on your wallet then head over to [TheClickMill.com](https://theclickmill.com). We suggest starting with a community mentions package to start generating traffic asap. From there we can work on building up your domain authority and getting you ranked on the first page for a bunch of keywords in your niche with our other services.",

      "selftext": "Pretty random but thought I‚Äôd share (just read the book about Amazon). Bezos made a TON of money as an angel investor into Google.\n\nTLDR: In 1998, Amazon acquired a startup called Junglee and the acquisition was basically a disaster. But one of the employees, Ram Shriram, ended up intro‚Äôing Bezos to Larry Page and Sergey Brin. They show him a prototype, and he wrote a $250k check on the spot into their $1M seed round.\n\nFast forward to Google‚Äôs IPO in 2004, that $250k was worth $280M. If he had held on to it, that would have been $20B today (I heard that on the Acquired podcast).\n\nPretty much the reality of investing in startups. If you're already meeting smart people and building relationships, the opportunities show up in your workflow. Not from \"deal hunting.\"",

      "selftext": "My barber does a great job cutting hair, but like most barbershops, the prices are a bit steep these days ($30+, plus tip).\n\nPersonally, my hair grows very fast, so if I wanted to keep it clean, I would easily have to get my haircut at least once every two weeks or so. It also doesn't help that I don't have the greatest neckline (i.e. it looks messy once my hair starts to grow out). However, paying that much money just wasn't something I was willing to do so I would wait longer than I wanted to between cuts.\n\nMy barber mentioned to me that business wasn't doing well. This wasn't a surprise to me because his shop was rarely busy.\n\nI have no barbershop experience but I do enjoy thinking of ways to make businesses more efficient and profitable.\n\nI suggested that he try this: offer basic (not bad) haircuts that he could do quickly &amp; efficiently, for a lower price. This would mean no skin fades and no use of scissors (I know this might sound crazy but a previous barber of mine only used clippers and it worked completely fine for my shorter hairstyle. He had longer clipper attachment guards so this isn't a matter of everyone getting a short buzzcut) because that also rules out longer hairstyles, etc.\n\nThere is a market out there for people like myself who are wanting basic haircuts and would get haircuts more frequently if the price was lower.\n\nHe took my advice and he has never been busier. There is almost always someone waiting in line for a haircut, and he has even implemented a numbering system. He charges $22 with no tip option. Although the price is lower, his chair almost always has someone in it and he gets through his haircuts much faster.\n\nSomething I want to stress again is that these are not bad haircuts. These are just simple (compared to some other haircuts out there) haircuts. Yes, I know cutting your hair at home is an option but that is irrelevant to this. There are many reason why someone may not want to cut their own hair, and also, some people do skin fades on themselves so a basic haircut does not automatically mean that someone can do it themselves.",

      "selftext": "Quick update to my previous posts about the nightmare client situation.\n\nContext: one client makes up $5k per month which is almost half of my revenue. They've been complete chaos, disorganized records, 2am receipt dumps, constant weekend emergencies. I posted asking if I should fire them and Reddit overwhelmingly said raise rates and set boundaries instead.\n\nI sent an email last week raising their rate from $5k to $7.5k per month and included an actual service framework with 10-day submission deadlines, rush fees for last-minute requests, communication hours Monday through Friday 9am-6pm only, and no more weekend work.\n\nThey went silence for a week. I was legitimately convinced they were ghosting me and started mentally preparing for losing half my income. Yesterday they called me and we had this tense 20 mins talk with lots of questions and pushback, but I honestly couldn't tell where it was heading.\n\nThis morning, I got their email response and I'm honestly conflicted about what to do. Screenshot attached.\n\nThey want to move forward but counter offer $7k per month instead of $7.5k. They're also pushing back on the timeline, saying they want to start with 7 business days deadlines instead of 10 and work up to it over the next quarter. And here's the one that's really bothering me, they accept the Monday-Friday 9-6 communication hours but want to discuss exceptions for quarterly filing periods where some weekend work might be necessary. They did acknowledge that they kinda expected this coming given how they've been operating, and they need 90 days to review how it's working. But I'm genuinely torn here.\n\nPart of me says take the deal because I won the principle, $7k is still a 40% increase, and some of their pushback seems reasonable for a transition period. Part of me says hold firm because I set $7.5k for a reason, that quarterly exception language feels like the exact slippery slope back to weekend chaos, and they're already negotiating boundaries before even accepting them. I'm leaning more towards the take the deal part.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/57jxtujji6yf1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=deb53723b067c6ddadac9b593edf1b46a22dc38f\n\n",

But this is the only part that I'm concerned about:\n\n\"And here's the one that's really bothering me, they accept the Monday-Friday 9-6 communication hours but want to discuss exceptions for quarterly filing periods where some weekend work might be necessary. They did acknowledge that they kinda expected this coming given how they've been operating, and they need 90 days to review how it's working. But I'm genuinely torn here.\"\n\nNotice how you said: \"What's really bothering me-\"\n\nMy thoughts are this, tell them that you agree with the first 2 conditions.\n\nHowever, when you have to work for weekends, ask them to add the additional 500.

      "selftext": "# \"Comfort is the worst addiction\" - Marcus Aurelius\n\nI think some of you might relate to this, some of you might learn from my mistakes.\n\nSince I was 15-16 years old I did every business model you can think of: forex, stock trading, affiliate marketing, SEO blogs, dropshipping, customer acquisition/lead generation agency, CPA marketing, SMMA, POD, Amazon FBA, Amazon Merch, Amazon KDP... you name it. I wasn't afraid of work, I wasn't afraid of risk, I was disciplined.\n\nBut in 2020 everything collapsed around me.\n\n* My Amazon KDP account got banned (how I was earning money at that time)\n* I broke up with my girlfriend\n* One of my closest friends and my accountability partner passed away\n\nI still had around $150k saved up, so financially I was comfortable, that's where my life really fell apart.\n\nI though I'll have a few months off to reset, but that turned into five years of comfort, depression, procrastination and avoidance. Having no pressure and no accountability I sliped into all the easiest escaped of all, video games, distractions, mindless media, short dopamine hits, ZERO DISCIPLINE. I told myself \"I would start again tomorrow\", \"...next week\", ...next month\"...\n\nComfort was my drug. The worst part is that it didn't feel harmful at the time, but it was killing my ambition.\n\nThen life hit me again. In early 2024, a series of unexpected expenses wiped me down to \\~$15k and shortly after, I got hit with a fine from an old dropshippping project where my business partner screwed me over. I went from comfortable... to broke... to in debt.\n\nBut that pain made me wake up. It brought back the hunger that comfort had stolen from me.\n\nI returned to Amazon KDP with purpose and I managed to build a decent business and because of it I am going to pay off my debt by the end of this year.\n\nI'm sharing this because some of you are in the exact danger zone that I lived in. Enough comfort to survive, not enough pain to change, slowly dying inside while calling it \"rest\", \"balance\" or \"taking time\".  \nComfort isn't rest, it is a cage with pillows.\n\nSo if you're building your business now, procrastinating your next project or thinking about quitting.¬†**LEAN INTO THE DISCOMFORT**. That is where all the progress lives.\n\nI wasted 5 years of my life learning this the hard way. I just hope that even one person who reads this, avoids the same trap that got me.",

I feel like a lot of people give it a lot of different names But the one I've liked the most is. **thinking on a long time horizon** or \"***What will the actions I've done today get me, multiplied by two years? Where will i be? What will i have?\"*** It helps you realize that all you really are is a series of inputs and actions. I'm not saying you can't enjoy video games, Or even enjoy a TV show and so on. But it's the level of severity that matters, Playing an hour of a video game after a long stay of work can feel fantastic. We're playing 6 to 8 hours for eight days in a row? Where will that get you in two years? But if you look at your life as merely actions that will eventually amount to something, it can make things clear On what you'll need to do to increase the percentage chance you'll succeed or have the life you want. and when you think about it like that, **the game of life becomes clear**. In order to play the game you need to ***flip the coin as many times as possible***, Knowing full well you'll fail. The second thing you'll need is an ***understanding of how to flip the coin In a better way***, The aggregation of skills. The last thing you'll need ***is a long enough time horizon*** Where all your effort compounds and you can win a majority of the time.   \n\\~Alas, it's easier said than done. Good luck to all to play this game of life!",

LinkedIn is drowning in them. Twitter is full of \"building in public\" threads. But here's what's strange: actual product launches haven't increased proportionally. Neither have real SaaS companies reaching profitability.\n\nWhat we *have* seen is an explosion of:\n\n* Productivity tools for founders\n* Communities for founders\n* Courses teaching founders\n* Newsletters about founding\n* Tools to help founders build tools\n\nThe picks-and-shovels game has never been better. Why? Because the identity of \"founder\" has become more appealing than the reality of building a product. It's easier to buy a course about validating ideas than to actually talk to 50 potential customers. It's more comfortable to join a community than to write cold emails.\n\nThis isn't criticism, it's market observation. If you're actually building something real, you're now competing in a space where most \"competitors\" are just role-playing. And if you're selling tools to founders, you've found a market that's growing faster than the actual problems they're meant to solve.\n\nThe question is: which side of this do you want to be on?",

Most competitors are selling the dream, not the discipline. So, to answer your question, as a RevOps Architect, the answer for me is clear. I focus 100% on the chaos created by the noise. That huge market you described the one buying tools to solve problems they don't even have yet, here‚Äôs what. They all eventually hit the RevOps Failure Cascade. That's the moment their forecast becomes a lie, their teams start battling, and they realize the tools don't talk to each other. We don't sell the tool. We sell the certainty that the whole damn system won't break when you need it most. That's the only way to build a real company in this market. So now I am curious to know, if you're building a real solution, what's the one metric right now that your team consistently struggles to align on? Is it LTV, CAC, or pipeline stage conversion?

Whether they can be called a founder should be judged by whether they have created something valuable.\n\n\n\nI see many people pursuing founder status as a form of self-PR and a desire to promote their products. However, this approach should be completely opposite. Before your product is released, excessive PR can make you impetuous, lose yourself, and forget what's truly important. For a product, when it's not truly ready, premature PR will bring low value and ROI.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the excessive obsession with the identity of the founder is caused by premature PR, but premature PR has low value and ROI for both individuals and products.",

As a potential owner, I am looking only at the profit from the other nail techs, if the current owner works, Ill add 40% of their earnings minus 20% (to account for tips) to the profit calculation. Then Ill look at the size of the salon, and the condition of the salon, and location of the salon. In particular I want to know how many nail techs there are in the salon, how many are staying. The more nail techs the more valuable the business. Also I want to know how many pedicures chairs the salon has, and the condition of the pedicure chairs. A pedicure chair can cost up to 10k to install plus the cost of the chair itself 1.5 to 4k. If the if the salon's chairs and furniture are too old that would decrease the value. \n\nYou haven't really given much valuable information to determine a prize. It could be as low as 100k or as high as 500k. You won't get 3x profits like some others suggest.

Landlords in this situation have a lot of leverage, so even if she sells the business itself below market, then she could make up for it in time through reasonable rent increases.  \n\nIf owns but is planning to sell the building, my advice to you is, buy it and offer the new salon owner a long-term lease on terms that work for you both!

She should definitely get more than real estate value but customers can stop coming in the day she leaves. Things like location and nearby salons will make a big difference. If she is the only game in town she should get a premium. Hard to put a number on it without knowing more.",

Otherwise, to a random buyer it‚Äôs fairly risky. If they know what they‚Äôre doing, they are unlikely to want to pay more money for more than the location. With a long enough training/support period (as in your mom helping with the transition of the clients to the new owner) and good terms it could work for a random buyer though. \n\nI‚Äôd say there‚Äôs value to the business (separate from the real estate), but you probably want to do some work to prep it prior to a sale to make it more valuable and expand your buyer pool.",

I made terrible designs. But I kept going.\n\nAfter six months, I got my first freelance job. It was a logo for a small coffee shop. They paid me $150.\n\nI went to the garage to tell my dad. I showed him the design on my phone and the payment email. He wiped his hands on a rag and looked at it for a long time.\n\nHe didn't say \"well done\" or \"I'm proud of you.\" He just put his greasy hand on my shoulder and squeezed. Then he nodded and went back under a car.\n\nThat was all I needed. He passed away last year.\n\nI'm a full-time designer now. I have a fast computer. But I still have that old laptop. I keep it in my office. The fan doesn't work anymore, and the screen is dim.\n\nBut sometimes I just open it and look at it. It was the only thing he knew how to give me.

      "selftext": "started a small agency back in undergrad, now doing my masters at masters union and still running it from hostel room. every client call, they're super formal. \"yes sir\" \"thank you sir\" and i'm like... bro i'm a kid üò≠ but obviously i don't say that.\n\nyesterday on a call, guy asked me some technical question about pixel tracking. i BLANKED. fully sweating, heart pounding, somehow fumbled through an answer. he just goes \"perfect, exactly what we need\" and i'm sitting there like... does he know i on gpt rn üò≠? does he know my roommate's eating maggi behind me rn?\n\nclosed the deal. $5k. but the imposter syndrome hit different.\n\nanyone else freelance while studying? how do you not feel fake when clients think you're way more experienced than you are?",

Came from a disadvantaged background, spent some months homeless as a child with my whole family living in a 1 bed B&amp;B that they packed a sofa bed into. I'm 34 now, life is so different and I worked really hard to get here. But I remember when I was 27 I had just been listed as a 30 under 30 rising star of my industry in a national title and meanwhile my elderly mum and I were renting a horrible flat where the electrics were shot, there were mice in the walls and black mould. The imposter syndrome was real. My closest friend has an evening more amazing career trajectory and now makes $200k a year but she sleeps on the floor of a crowded house while supporting her mum with her family of 4 and her dad who's in the late stages of dementia. She looks pristine whenever you see her but behind closed doors she's trying to cover everything for her family. She works remotely and no one really know the reality of her situation. So believe me when I say everyone is just keeping up appearances.",

Our marketing team now quickly spins up landing pages, lead gens using Lovable/Bolt instead of having to wait for engineering or external contractors. It's not great for complex apps but it's great for marketing landing pages, and simple stuff!¬†Basically you can clone your landing page for a dedicated/custom one for every ad etc very quickly! Easily save thousands of dollars we used to spend on contractors and a lot of time trying to coordinate stuff between teams!\n* Cursor/Windsurf: These help everyone in our engineering team write code atleast 2x faster. That's atleast $10k in savings per month I guess!\n* Frizerly: we used to hire freelancers on Upwork to do keyword research and blogs for our website to improve our Google ranking! Now their AI automates all of that for us! That's about $2k saved every month!\n* Google Nano Banana/AI Studio: Great to create marketing assets like photoshoots, change colors of products etc. This again is money we used to pay freelancers saved, on top of time ig!\n\nCurious what others have found as well!",

      "selftext": "**A bit of context**  \nI have been building mobile apps for a long time. I also ran an agency in Europe that shipped consumer apps. In the last two years I learned as much as in the eight years before. Consumer can work, but it is hard. There is a lot of competition. Many teams are funded. Good branding and design matter. Ads and store strategy matter. Vibecoding helps with speed, but it does not give you product sense or design skills. Most solo builders don‚Äôt have all of that.\n\n**What this is about**  \nI started building internal mobile apps for small businesses. These apps are private. The icon has their logo. The data is theirs. The app runs one important job their team does every day. Owners can build it. Or a builder can build it for them. The value is simple: fewer mistakes, faster hand-offs, cleaner records, money collected sooner.\n\n**What the apps do, in plain terms**  \nField work: the worker arrives, taps ‚Äústart,‚Äù takes photos, collects a signature, taps ‚Äúdone,‚Äù and the invoice is sent.  \nStudios and salons: bookings are kept in one place, reminders go out on time, no double booking.  \nShops and wholesalers: scan items, update stock, get a clean export for accounting.  \nForms and compliance: fill forms offline, require all fields, get a signed PDF saved in the right folder.\n\n**Pricing and learning to watch**  \nSome platforms look cheap, then get expensive with seats, credits, or add-ons. Read what counts as usage. Check if you can export the project. Check who owns the data. Test the tool before paying. Plan time to learn it. One focused week now is cheaper than rebuilding later.\n\n**What must be solid**  \nThese are utility apps. One core feature must work every time.  \nIf the core is booking, the app must not lose state.  \nIf the core is notifications, they must arrive on time.  \nIf the core is inventory, scans must be reliable.  \nIf the core is forms, offline must work and signatures must stick.  \nNice screens do not fix broken behavior.\n\n**Ownership and scope**  \nKeep the brand of the business. Icon, splash, wording. Keep the data with the business. Keep roles simple. Decide if the app is only for staff or also for clients to see status or book. Fewer options means more use.\n\n**A simple way to build and improve**  \nMake a small version that runs end to end. Put it on the phones of the people who do the job. Watch where they get stuck. Fix the biggest problem. Ship again. Repeat once or twice. When it feels smooth for them, brand it fully and roll it out.\n\n**How to build**  \nI am technical, and for this kind of job I would not use Cursor. I would pick a mobile-focused vibecoding platform with three qualities: a good code model that handles real app logic (not only UI), built-in help for store tasks like signing, builds, TestFlight or internal testing, and App Store and Play submission, and clear pricing that stays reasonable without surprise per-seat or credit spikes. I use Vibecode App. It is free to start, the credit system is fair, and it is easy to ramp up. Whatever you choose, test navigation, state, auth, and push on real devices before you commit.\n\n**How to charge**  \nCharge a monthly fee that includes support and small improvements. Add a setup fee if there are integrations or data migration. Be clear on what is included. No surprise bills.\n\n**Reddit can help**  \nSpend time where your users talk. Read pain posts. Do not spam. Good places to start:¬†smallbusiness, salons, truckers etc (there is a TON). Search for ‚Äúno-show,‚Äù ‚Äúdouble booking,‚Äù ‚Äúinventory count,‚Äù ‚Äúinvoice delay.‚Äù Build the fix they describe.\n\n**Last tip**  \nIn many industries, just saying ‚Äúwe have a mobile app‚Äù still helps, even if the first version is simple. It opens doors. Then you earn trust by making one workflow work very well.",

I would love to hear what others have found but here are two that I often find people overlook\n\nI often find businesses either not using the blogs feature on their website or writing blogs without an intent.  With proper keyword planning using your Google Search Console data, blogs can help your website show up as top result for various queries people are searching for! These days with AI tools like Frizerly and Pulse that can automate both keyword research and drafting the blog itself, it's a no-brainer! Free organic traffic for life in the long run if you are consistent imo!\n\nSimilarly find the subreddits and forums your customers hang out and be an active participant there. Genuinely add value. I suggest not ever adding links but instead honestly plug your brand/company name when it makes sense. This does not only get people currently on that thread but these often show up on google search results bringing more customers over time",

A lot of people think they have to start their own blogs/websites without realizing that to be able to get traffic with their website, they need to build authority and promote their content so they can then rank higher on search engines and get long term exposure that way.  \n  \nSEO isn't something you focus on at the begining, it's something you start doing as you scale up. Instead, what I like doing is using SparkToro to see where my audience is and then join relevant communities. Also, I like doing a competitive analysis to find gaps I can fill, targeting low competition topics first.\n\nFor example, say I'm in the cybersecurity industry and want to get more exposure. The first thing I'd do is search on SparkToro. According to SparkToro, the social networks most used by searchers of cybersecurity are:\n\n1. Github\n2. LinkedIn\n3. X\n\nIn that order. Meaning, me joining Facebook or Instagram would be a bit of a waste of time (or at the very least more expensive to reach the same audience). After all, those aren't the platforms people go to to learn more about cybersecurity.\n\nNow that I now which platforms to target, I'd research problems I can solve and content I can create. Tools like Ahrefs help you find keywords (topics) with low competition or at the very least, keywords you can compete for (taking advantage of the massive authority Github, LinkedIn and X have).\n\nThen it'd be a matter of filtering those keywords to spot the topics that actually have business value. Just because something has low competition, doesn't mean we should waste our time creating content around it. You need to know your target persona so you can create content specific for them.\n\nFocus on solving problems, not selling your products or services. What I mean is, your product or service should be a part of the solution to the problem they have, you shouldn't hard sell.\n\nLet me give you an example. Say you are selling antivirus software and the problem you seek to solve is removing malware specifically from browsers. You could target a topic like: \"How to remove the Yahoo search redirect virus\"\n\nAt that point, you'd know your target audience is someone who isn't very technical and is likely someone older, around 40-50 years old. Then you can write your copy using a copywriting framework like PAS (Problem - Agitate - Solution).\n\nYou can say something like:\n\n&gt;I had the same problem two years ago. I tried to search for stuff on Google but it would automatically redirect me to Yahoo to a random page. The biggest problem was I didn't know what was happening, but I talked to a friend who is more tech savvy and he recommended I do the following.  \nFirst, download the \\[product\\] extension. \\[this would be your product\\]  \nThen create an account and... \\[continue with the explanation\\]\n\nThat's it. After that, it's just a matter of promoting it. No matter how good your content is, if nobody sees it, it's useless. If you don't have an audience, use advertising to reach your target audience. Just promote the content you created in the platform you know you audience already hanges out in.\n\nThis is a bit of an oversimplification but that's what I'd do. It works every time for getting leads and selling products and services.",

It takes a good amount of time to grow and establish decent organic traffic, but once you do there is a steady stream of high intent monthly users coming to your website free of charge (depending on the keywords you optimized for). \n\nI think SEO is particularly strong / promising for businesses competing in a niche that is maybe underserved by high quality businesses with good marketing teams. You go onto Semrush and find most high volume keywords within the niche are low competition and much easier to rank for than say, a reporting SaaS software. \n\nPlus it is not too difficult to use AI and semrush to do great, relevant keyword research and then a tool such as Wincher ($30/month - cheap) to optimize your various landing pages for the best keywords. Bonus - you can include your lead gen form on all of these pages to direct organic traffic right into the funnel.",

          "body": "Many people will tell you \"**to give value**\" before you take, But many people overestimate What is required to make a connection in the first place. what I mean is people often think they need to \"Build someone a website\" or \"Offer them your area of expertise\". But the truth is ***most people don't know what they want***, but what most people want Is to see *\"any signal\"* That you are **trustworthy, Loyal, And a safe bet**. And you can signal many of those things By simply **showing up and being a positive force** in whatever they're doing. This can be as simple as finding three people in your industry, across whatever platform you desire, discord, LinkedIn, Hell even Twitter. and then consistently reaching out to them on their posts, encouraging, offering your perspective in a positive way, and sometimes even trying to offer value, But I find encouragement works the best. If you persistently do this for around three weeks, *then they'll start to notice you*, And so long as what you ask for is reasonable and at a small enough level, Many will offer you a helping hand because of your encouragement. (Think: Hi \\_\\_\\_\\_, I am Starting to Build my First Webpage, could i tap into your experience and could I show you &amp; could you tell me if i\"m on the right track?) then After they do that small ask, **offer them a list of thing your willing to help them with Because of what they've done for you**, make sure it is a list of thing they might find valuable. *The funny thing is they might never take you up on any of these things*, But what you've done is shown that you're willing to reciprocate, That when something is done for you, you are fully open to doing something for them and in turn this **builds trust, loyalty, And assures them that you're a safer bet** than a stranger when they might need a favor. It's also just a really good method of building rapport with anybody.... \n\nI know this is a more analytical Approach than you might have been looking for, but being an overly emotional person such as myself, I find things are almost always simpler when you break them down to the actions you need to take, And why those actions result in a meaningful connection with another person. it makes things clearer and more easy to act upon.   \n\\~Anyways I hope this was helpful my friend, please take care and good luck in your journey to make connections!",

That was step one haha.  \nI think ultimately, it will come down to taking action. Just start and see what happens. A great reframe I heard was 'the work works on you more than you work on the work'. My takeaway from that is that it doesn't matter so much about the outcome of what you're working on, but more what it does to shape you, your thoughts and whatever you choose to do in the future.  \nBest of luck mate",

AI has mostly gotten rid of my need for grunt workers. Those are the guys who are truly screwed. I no longer need to pay someone to make a design for me.

Signup for freelance work websites like upwork,etc (start with 2,3 popular and trusted ones)\n\nNow comes trust which will be your biggest entry barrier in any field. To build trust\n1. Reddit- start posting and commenting on your niche sub reddit(genuine help is what you are supposed to do, do not sell your services, remember you are here to build trust)\n2. Linkedin- start posting 3x a week for 2 months, see what kind of posts are working and then double down on it, your post should resonate with your ideal customer base.\nWhile you do that you can simultaneously start approaching people on LinkedIn and people on sub reddits if they require your services. What their immediate pain points are that you can resolve with your skill set.\nRemember while you create content you are supposed to engage with other people's content especially who are doing well in your field of service.\n\nApproach method:\nStart DM ing people who interact with your post and introduce yourself and what you do, do not sell them anything, yet. Once you have little trust and they know you you can ask them about what their pain points are that you can resolve for them with your skill sets. Most people will be open to discussing it since you are not an unknown character for them now.\n\nStart with this first then you will understand, improve and make your own strategies as you go \n\nPS- Think of this as a starter kit so you are not lost while you take the first step.",

I am becoming more lonely. I‚Äôm in my mid-30s and have spent almost a decade coding and building startups, mostly alone. I have 2 years experience in a company as a employee but most of my career is working as a solo freelancer developer.\n\nAlso, I‚Äôm not married, and I‚Äôve never really been a social person. I have a couple of friends, but they‚Äôre all married and busy, so we rarely see each other.\n\nNow that the company has 10 people, I actually feel more isolated. The more we grow, the heavier the decisions and responsibilities get. I can‚Äôt really talk about these things with my employees, and there aren‚Äôt many people around me who would understand.\n\nI just want to stay focused on building a better product, but lately it feels like my personal struggles are growing faster than the company. Sometimes I wonder, is this deep loneliness just part of being a founder? Or am I doing something wrong?\n\nIt‚Äôs starting to affect my weekends. Instead of learning or doing something meaningful, I waste time playing games or doing nothing. My focus is fading, and I‚Äôm honestly scared that if this keeps up, it might start hurting the company too.\n\nI don‚Äôt know how to deal with this. Any advice would mean a lot.\n\n*(P.S. Last time I posted something similar, I got a bunch of DMs from people offering ‚Äúconsulting sessions.‚Äù Most of them were just ads. Please don‚Äôt do that this time.)*",

The pressure of looking after over 100 people really got to me which ultimately got me to sell the business. I could have gone on and kept building (my business was voted \"most likely to reach unicorn status\" a few years ago...

They don't talk about what happens when your brain actually breaks down\n\nHere's what they won't tell you. You'll lose passion for your startup even though you love the idea. You'll make stupid decisions because you're exhausted. You'll get angry at your team for no reason. You'll think everyone would be better without you running this.\n\nSleep won't help. Eight hours feels like nothing. Your body is just broken from the stress.\n\nYou'll isolate because it feels easier than pretending everything's fine. Simple decisions become impossible. You'll second guess yourself constantly even though you're supposed to be the confident founder.\n\nAnd the worst part is you keep pushing harder because stopping feels like admitting defeat. That's the trap VCs want you in. Keep grinding. Keep sacrificing. Keep ignoring the warning signs.\n\nNobody calculates the cost of burned out founders making bad decisions. They just care about the next funding round.\n\nThat's what VCs won't tell you.\n\nThis is just a serious post, people may agree or not. but this can be true with more than half of Co-founders.",

So, would you be happy to stay if this annoyance ceases. Be real and if stay is the answer then be bold for your own development. Yet, start today working on plan B. What say you?",

If though you contacted them about a verifiably fake review and refused to pay they would without any subtlety explain that knowing this review was hurting a real business they would not only leave it up but promote it heavily via seo and other methods as well as search out other existing negative reviews or people willing to give negative reviews. \n\nYou either paid up or every search associated with your business be it name or market in your area would get the worst reviews presented high up in the results. \n\nI paid a lawyer and in the end found that they were legally untouchable and that it was much cheaper to just pay the extortion and move on than it was to try and fight it. \n\nIt was one of the things during a rough 6 year period that led me to see our legal system for what it has actually become.

          "body": "Yelp does exist because it primarily falls under the legal umbrella of free speech and public opinion. The platform definitely positions itself as a public forum where consumers can share their experiences. These experiences can be good, bad, or sometimes even fabricated. And this is because it's all user-generated content. We need to understand that Yelp isn't held directly liable for what users post under Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act. In simple terms we can say that they do provide the megaphone, but not the message. I would say it's perfectly legal for anyone to create a review of a business listing, even without the owner's consent, as long as the content doesn't meet the legal definition of defamation. So while Yelp's survival might seem insane to many of us, it's definitely not illegal. We should understand that it's just internet, unfiltered and unregulated.\n\nYou can ask your customers to share their experiences on yelp and this should help boost the review score. If you look at the review pages of largest companies in the world you will realise that the percentage of negative review is more then positive ones. This is primarily because happy customers usually do not care about leaving review. Fear is not reality. You will have so many positive reviews and just in some time that negative review will go down and your profile will shine again.\n\nSearch for Delete Yelp Reviews on google there are some sites that offer such services.\n\nI hope this helps.",

File a case in small claims court against Yelp and the villain then file discovery motions with Yelp regarding what they have for the listing. You may have to follow up with the ISP to identify the villain if they used a fake name. In most small claims courts, you need permission from the judge but they will likely grant your request if it's reasonable. Yelp will not like being sued and probably delete the information and block the villain.\n\nThis shouldn't take too long. File the case, request permission from the judge, file discovery, and go to court if necessary. If you drop the case against Yelp, then you can still go after the villain if you want compensation and revenge. I don't know how you prove damages but Google should have some guidance. \n\nIf you get a judgment against the villain, then collecting is another process but they can be forced to a deposition to provide their banking information and other assets. If they are a no show for this deposition, this will be civil contempt of court and they will have a warrant for their arrest. I believe they sit in jail until they comply or make bail promising to show. \n\nLiens and wage garnishment are yet another step in the process after deposition. You can attach their bank account and go after their wages and other eligible assets which another step in the paperwork process. Homesteads are generally exempt so you can't file a lien against it.\n\nThe best part about your case is these are what are known as intentional torts which cannot be discharged through bankruptcy. The villain is stuck with it forever and it's earning interest at the statutory rate which is 6% in my state.\n\nThis is an undertaking but if you have a penchant for revenge, you can go after the villain.",

      "selftext": "\n\nI run a small residential roofing company (just me + 4 guys, doing around $40k/month) and there's one competitor who's always been our biggest rival in the area. We're cordial at supply shops but definitely competing for the same jobs.\n\nLast week I found out (through our shared insurance broker, long story) that they've been straight up lying to clients about having a general contractor's license. Like they claim to be \"fully licensed and insured\" on their website, truck wraps, everywhere. But they're not. At all. Never have been. I checked the state licensing board myself - nothing under their business name or the owner's name.\n\nThe kicker? Three of their current clients are homeowners I gave quotes to in the last 6 months and lost the job to them. One lady SPECIFICALLY told me she went with them because \"they seemed more legit with all their certifications\" and she felt safer. These are $15k-30k jobs btw.\n\nNow I'm sitting here like... do I say something? Part of me wants to send a \"hey just fyi\" message to those homeowners because like, if something goes wrong on their roof and the guy has no license, their homeowner's insurance might not cover it?? But another part of me feels like that's sketchy territory and I'll just look like a salty competitor trying to poach clients.\n\nMy lead guy says absolutely not, \"let karma handle it\" and it'll eventually blow up in their face anyway. My wife thinks I have a moral obligation to say something, especially since unlicensed work can void warranties and insurance claims.\n\nBut also like... they're literally breaking the law and winning contracts because of it. In our state you NEED a contractor's license for jobs over $10k. This isn't just shady, it's straight up illegal, right?\n\nThe thing that's really eating at me is one of those clients is an elderly couple on a fixed income who scraped together money for a roof replacement. They're getting scammed by someone who might leave them with zero recourse if something goes wrong. That one bugs me the most.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? What did you do? I'm losing sleep over this and honestly just need some outside perspective from people who get it.",

The work is steady and ive built up a solid clientele the past 6 years. \n\nPart of the job sometimes involves getting calls from farmers ive never dealt with inquiring about my prices etc. Cue sketch ball McGee. (SB for short)\n\nI get a call from a farmer not in my territory, which was a red flag. My service isnt super unique. You travel and hour or two any direction and you find another of me thats happy to do the work. Why wasn't he calling them?\n\nSays he cant get anyone to spread ag lime for him. Red flag #2. Has 120 acres he wants a whopping 4 tons to the acre. (Note, 1-2 tons an acre is most common, 3 is max if the ph is awful). \nI say sure ill do whatever you want. Asks for a quote, get him one, $30 a ton for purchasing the lime, trucking and spreading. $120/acre. He says sure sounds good. Start anytime. \n\nNow normally with my usual farmers this is no big deal. I spread, pay all the inputs, then bill them for all materials plus my time on top. Never had an issue. But something was off with him, but at the same time if he was real this was a big profit job. My dad whose much wiser than me told me to ask him for half up front. \"Tell him this is standard procedure with new clients.\" So I did. Dude said ok ill get back you. Never heard from again. Dodged a bullet i think. \n\nNow I know why no one in his area would work with him. ",

Everything was great until about six months ago or so.\n\nWe have a shared business account but we both also use our personal cards for business stuff pretty regularly cuz if you're at home depot or whatever it's very normal to use whatever card is in your wallet. The problem is that he's just TERRIBLE about telling me what he bought or sending receipts.\n\nLast month I'm going through our bank statements and I see all these random Venmo transactions I don't recognize at all. Turns out he's been paying contractors in cash and venmoing himself reimbursements without documenting anything. When I asked him about it he got defensive and said I should 'trust him' and that I should not worry about it which is fucking crazy because I don't have a single bill screenshot nothing to know what was paid\n\n We've been friends for 15 years but I also need to know where our money is going because I've worked so fucking hard for this business and I barely get 6 hours of sleep every SINGLE day (including weekends) for it to work. We're not a lemonade stand we have actual obligations and I'm pretty sure our accountant is going to murder us at tax time.\n\nThe worst incident was two weeks ago. He bought a 3.8k piece of equipment that we'd talked about but hadn't decided on yet. He just bought it. Using his personal card btw and he didn't mention it at all. I found out because the company that sold it called OUR business line asking about delivery and I had no idea what they were talking about and I had to play dumb on the phone\n\nWhen I confronted him he said he saw a good deal and didn't want to bother me and now I'm the asshole for being upset about an unauthorized 3.8k purchase? He says I'm being controlling and acting like his mom.\n\nI don't want to ruin our friendship but I also just can't run a business like this. Have any of you dealt with this? How do you set up financial boundaries with a business partner without making it weird?  \n  \nI'm sorry everyone for the long post but I'm not sure how to solve this and just keep the friendship at the same time",

We capture clear action items on what to do next and make sure we both agree. Weekly has worked well for us. And we capture discussion points throughout the week for our next meeting and just bang them out quickly over 30 minutes.\n\nThere will be times when someone can't wait for the next meeting to make a big decision. In that case, you either need to have clear predefined/agreed upon roles for what sorts of decisions people can make solo. But you also need a mechanism for how to handle emergent issues. That's like just a text saying \"hey, need 5 minutes to discuss doing X.\" \n\n---\n\nFYI: that word _mechanism_ is key. You need an agreed upon way to handle decisions and what process you will follow. You want it to be consistent, repeatable, and clear to both people. Keep it light weight, especially if you are still getting the company stable. If he pushes back on this stuff, say you need to be in the loop on all company decisions as it helps you make better decisions as things shift. If he doesn't get that, then he isn't really interested in building a business... \n\n---\n\n&gt; When I confronted him he said he saw a good deal and didn't want to bother me and now I'm the asshole for being upset about an unauthorized 3.8k purchase?

          "body": "Okay, the time to really work out these procedures was before you ever got in business with the guy, but now that you're here, you need to have a hard conversation. I'm going to give you a basic rubric for a conversation, and I think you should think about using this when you're talking to your friend.\n\nWhat I'm going to tell you is a brief and incomplete synopsis of the book \"Rapport: the four ways of reading people\". The title is a misnomer - It's actually the result of two PhD psychologists studying terrorists to try and interrogate them better. They found a way of having conversations that keeps people in difficult conversations without them tapping out. It turns out that it works on terrorists, it works on teenagers, it works on my fiance now wife and it works on the people I have to interview for work. \n\nThe fundamentals of this kind of conversation are HEAR. Honestly, Empathy, a respect for Autonomy, and Reflect what you hear. \n\nFor example, the conversation may sound like this.\n\n\"Hi Jim. Listen, we have to talk about something. First, I want to tell you that I hate this kind of conversation - we've known each other for forever, and I feel like I'm picking a fight with one of my best friends, and that's not my intent (Honesty). I can imagine how what I'm about to say will make you feel too - as I said, It's not my intent to pick a fight or nothing (empathy). The fact is that this business can't be ran without better communication on purchases and expenses. The problem isn't the paying contractors in cash or you fronting the money, the problem is that there's no records, and that you've made some big purchases on your own. Let's talk about the first one. I don't think you're stealing anything, but there are tax implications and liability implications as well, plus it makes things 10 times harder to handle accounting on the back end, and we need to be sure we're making money. I know that it's paperwork, but at the minimum you need to be putting invoice numbers for every time you do a venmo transaction, and there can only be one invoice per transaction. Let's talk about the second one - That $3,800 is a big expense for a business like ours. I know we talked about it, but That is x weeks profit for our business.  There should have been consensus.\n\nNow I know what you're going to say. First, I'm not your mom. I don't do laundry, and in any case I'm more like your wife - The shit that you do affects me too. I can't make you work with me on these issues, but I hope to make you see that they actually are issues that affect profit and how we run this business going forward. I want to be able to keep working with you on this until we sell out and retire at 35 (respect for autonomy). What do you think? Do you think these are problems, and do you think there's anything needs to be done about them?\"\n\nThat turned into more of the wall of text then I wanted, but you get the idea. I recommend picking up that book and giving it a skim (It's highly repetitive in places), because the reason I can't give you a complete synopsis is that you need a diagram in the book. Anyway, good luck.",

We never had a real partnership agreement (just something we downloaded and signed) until we decided to incorporate. Four years into our partnership I was drowning. I was working my ass off while she was on paid maternity leave and working remotely from another state \n\nEventually she moved back to my state and we hired three employees. Suddenly she said we didn‚Äôt have enough to pay ourselves and the employees. How? We had dozens of clients and were really humming. So we skipped paying ourselves. But, while her husband had a job, I was a single mom of two. So every time we had to skip paying ourselves I choked harder\n\nEventually I needed to find a job or I‚Äôd lose my house. My partner was livid when I told her I was leaving. When we met with our attorney I learned that we were $30k in debt (this was 2007). So instead of getting paid for half the value of the business, I OWED the business my half of that debt to buy myself out. I was a single mom who hadn‚Äôt even made my full $24k salary that year (yes, that was low back then too)\n\nTurns out we‚Äôd been taking down payments and advance billing our clients but not paying our vendors. We had a huge leased office and lots of business loans. I take 100% responsibility for not paying attention to my business financials. I started a business with no business experience and I made some big mistakes and learned a hard lesson. I should have consulted a lawyer before starting the business, but I was afraid of the expense. I should have had a real partnership agreement from day one. I should‚Äôve been more aware of the financial status of my company.\n\nUltimately, I took out a personal loan for $15,000 which I paid off within two years and subsequently ended up debt free a few years later. I don‚Äôt know what happened to her or the business and I eventually changed career paths\n\nI recommend you familiarize yourself as much as possible with everything about your business as quickly as you can. If your partner resists or doesn‚Äôt want you to see information that is a red flag, trust me. You need to review your partnership agreement and understand what legal options you have. If you have an operating agreement and your partner is in defiance of it then you need to consider legal options. this will be uncomfortable, but you don‚Äôt have to get angry or rude. Keep it cool and do your best to be respectful of your friend, even if he isn‚Äôt respecting you. Keep your head up a new what you can to get through this. Good luck!",

I‚Äôve talked to a few small business owners through my MBA who went into business with close friends, and almost everyone said the hardest part wasn‚Äôt the business itself, but the partnership dynamics.\n\nIt sounds like you‚Äôre right to be concerned. What‚Äôs happening here isn‚Äôt about trust, it‚Äôs about transparency and protecting both of you. The best operators I‚Äôve met handle this by putting SYSTEMS in place that make accountability automatic, so it doesn‚Äôt feel personal. For example, agree that any purchase above a certain amount (say $500) requires a quick written check-in even just a Slack or WhatsApp message before pulling the trigger. Make reimbursements contingent on documented receipts, like uploading a quick photo to a shared Google Drive folder. And if you can swing it, bring in a part-time bookkeeper or use accounting software like QuickBooks that both of you can access; having a third party involved takes the emotion out of it and adds structure.  \n  \nI know it‚Äôs tricky because you‚Äôve got years of friendship layered into this, but a lot of founders say the moment they treated the partnership like a board relationship, things got healthier.\n\nYou‚Äôre not being controlling; you‚Äôre acting like an owner.

These platforms are their own can of worms too though, and they really aren't appropriate unless you're a business that is served well via short form video/picture posts (like trying to sell designer shirts or a \"viral product\").

      "selftext": "I have recently started my own small business. I thought it would make me financially independent, as I cannot work in a normal job like everyone else because of my Bipolar Disorder. But the moment I started my business, I began facing many issues.\n\nThe first issue was trusting vendors I met online. I foolishly got scammed by fake vendors who sent me realistic invoices, but the products never arrived. This drained my savings and made my family lose trust in me. So instead of taking a big loan and a big risk, I decided to start a small business with a small loan‚Äîwithout realizing that there would be many gatekeepers, hidden costs, and the challenge of operating without working capital.\n\nI finally found an honest vendor who provided me with my goods, but our definitions of ‚Äúgood quality‚Äù were very different due to social status. I wanted to sell to middle and upper-middle-class people, but he thought the same quality applies for all. In India, there is also so much paperwork, and I got scammed by those who handle documentation. I was overcharged by those who made my labels.\n\nI am the first person in generations of my family and caste to ever start a business, so we had no inside knowledge. My own friends who come from business castes acted as gatekeepers‚Äîbecause that‚Äôs what they are taught. I tried to find distributors for my product, but most of them first take the product and then pay only if it‚Äôs sold. This meant I would have to blindly trust them, because even with proper documentation, no legal authorities would care or intervene if they cheated. They know that, and they take advantage of it.\n\nNow, I have a lot of products and no way to sell them. Social media marketing attracted a few friends and supporters to buy, but then the Postal Department refused to send my product because it‚Äôs food. I had to rely on private couriers, which cut all my margins. Nobody reveals where to buy cheap packaging, how to deliver packages at low cost, or how to find honest distributors.\n\nIn India, I think society is designed to keep new entrants out of business and to preserve business opportunities only for certain communities, while keeping the rest of society enslaved to corporates‚Äîso they continue buying from these same communities when it comes to small-scale businesses.",

Starting small and then scaling it while solving any other problems you face along the way. Yes, there are a lot of legal hurdles but many do well regardless of that. Thing is you don‚Äôt stop. \nAlso, it should be a no brainer that 9-5 is the easiest way of earning money lol. In a business, you take risk, spend time, money etc and learn along the way hoping for that exponential gain in the future. It can take years or even decades, what matters is learning by doing.

What you described, gatekeeping, opaque systems, unreliable partners, can make entrepreneurship feel way lonelier than people expect.\n\nOne of my professors likes to say that running a small business is ‚Äúan endurance game of controlled chaos,‚Äù and that really stuck with me. You‚Äôve already shown a lot of resilience by adapting. Those scars are actually the foundation most real entrepreneurs build on, it‚Äôs just that people rarely talk about them publicly.\n\nIf you‚Äôre still up for it, one thing that might help is connecting with local small business networks or accelerators, not the flashy startup ones, but those that focus on local trade or regional entrepreneurs. Even informal WhatsApp or Facebook groups can be gold for getting tips on packaging, logistics, or honest vendors. A few classmates doing ventures in emerging markets leaned heavily on those kinds of micro-communities; they‚Äôre messy but real.\n\nYou‚Äôre right that the system isn‚Äôt designed to make it easy, but the persistence you‚Äôve already shown puts you ahead of most people who stop at the first setback. I hope you don‚Äôt lose that spark even if you pause for a while. This experience will 100% shape how you think about business (and people) going forward.",

Does he make product all on his own? Or does have to rely and trust a third party? What could go wrong there? What are the legal and financial costs? What's the market size? Who are the competitors? How many do you have to sell to make a decent profit? How much will advertising cost? What about shipping costs? Tax costs? He puts it all into a spreadsheet and does a month to month run through. Will there be delays due to holidays? Flaky middle sellers? Rising in shipping costs? Drop in market demand? Competitors pricing you out? What can you tolerate? How low can you go? How much time and effort and money will all this cost? Can you do it alone? If you have to hire someone how does that complicate your business and life in terms of time, effort, money, profit, trust, taxes, and laws? All this is investigated and lightedly tested before even considering dropping the 9-5 job. \n\n2. The Deep-End Jumper: This guy thinks he'll figure out how to run a business after leaving his job, starting the business with little consideration of the risks and realities of the business and figures he'll learn on the way through mistakes (usually costly ones). \n\nThat said number 2 is typical type. Those who make it as number 2s usually don't quit no matter what it cost them - and it probably cost them a lot.",

It enables a husband to buy a gift and return or exchange it if his wife doesn‚Äôt like it ‚Äî meaning the purpose of it is to help you sell more. ¬†Sometimes people will abuse these, the obvious example in your business being to wear something for a party or wedding and then return it or something. Anyway, that‚Äôs a return policy.¬†\n\nA warranty is your guarantee that something is made with good workmanship and you will stand by it. ¬†A pav√© diamond should not fall out of a ring, for example, and if it does you will replace it maybe. A warranty can be time based or ‚Äúlifetime‚Äù or whatever you decide but the important thing is workmanship. If the item is properly made and the person decides they no longer like it or want it, or they failed to care for it and it‚Äôs dirty, or whatever else that does not go to workmanship, it is not your problem to fix this at your expense. ¬†Is the ring moldy because of workmanship? ¬†Is it tarnished because it was improperly coated and the coating wore off (idk about this stuff, just hazarding guesses)? ¬†If so you can repair. If the workmanship is on some dimension truly poor, you can offer a refund. It does not sound like this is the case.¬†\n\nSome jewelers offer free cleaning for life. ¬†This is a nice thing to do but also brings people back to your store maybe to buy more jewelry, so it‚Äôs not entirely motivated by generosity.¬†\n\nWhy don‚Äôt you tell her, bring the item by, I‚Äôll clean it and take a look at it and see if there‚Äôs anything wrong with it. ¬†Clean it and make it look nice. Then say, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it, so I can‚Äôt take it as a return. If it can be resold or has value in the precious metals, you can offer to accept it in exchange for a 40% discount on something else in the store or something, and give her those choices.¬†\n\nThere is nothing she can threaten you with that is going to go anywhere in a court of law and I would ignore any such treats and stop responding to her if she won‚Äôt stop making them. ¬†Again, this assumes you didn‚Äôt sell something of shoddy workmanship with a lifetime guarantee.¬†\n\nYou should make your returns and warranty policies clear and in writing and print them on your receipts.¬†",

Then tax season hits and my accountant asks for everything. I end up spending a weekend manually going through 12 months of bank statements, matching receipts, categorizing expenses, before sending it all to him. He charges $2k for year-end filing.\n\nThis year it finally caught up with me. I kept postponing the filing because I was dealing with other business challenges and ended up paying penalties to the government. \n\nI only have about 100-120 transactions per month including payroll, so it's not massive volume. My accountant asked $800/month for bookkeeping, but I think I'd still have to send him receipts, bills, statements, answer his emails etc.. etc..  so I'm doing half the work anyway.\n\n**My question:** Is there a middle ground between:\n\n* Doing nothing all year and paying penalties \n* Paying $9k/year for a bookkeeper when I'm still doing half the work\n\nAre any of you in a similar boat? What's working for you? Is monthly bookkeeping actually worth it, or are there tools/approaches that make DIY less painful?",

In that case, the only thing you might have to do is clarify a few transactions once or twice a month. Bills and receipts are a lot more work but can be optional depending on what your business needs, so if you're looking to do less admin on your end, you can provide your bookkeeper with view only access, and eliminate sortware-based receipt tracking (or track receipts only above certain amounts). You can also use a receipts-only email address that you and your bookkeeper both have access to, or use a receipts tool (i.e. Hubdoc) to streamline things. There are a lot of other options rather than manually managing every piece of paperwork that will make things a lot easier on your end. Good luck!",

It's written as a kids book/workbook but introduces you to the basics of business accounting very gently. We did this as a workshop in my company for anyone who might talk to clients about budgets/finances and it was immensely beneficial.  \n\\- MINIMUM BAR: put your transaction details in a spreadsheet  \n\\- Preferable: use an accounting system. Wave has a free version and it's a great place to start. Enter your transactions manually, and it will give you a proper balance sheet and P&amp;L. This will make things easier (read: cheaper) for your accountant to do tax prep. You can run invoices from here too.\n\nGrowing up a little:\n\n\\- Use paid version of Wave to automatically connect your bank account OR use another system that does the same (we use Xero, Quickbooks online is the market lead), just run invoices from whatever system you choose.  \n\\- Reconcile transactions once per week in the system, this is generally as easy as picking a category and clicking a button. For your size, should only take 15 mins / week. Get familiar enough with the process so that you can understand it for the next stage. Understanding debits/credits and how they work in a double entry accounting system, vs what types of accounts to use (asset/expense/liability etc..) will give you a foundational education that will help you later in your business as you grow it.\n\nDelegate:\n\n\\- Once you have a system in place, the basics working, and it's getting a little more complex and/or time consuming......get a bookkeeper.  \n\\- Cheap option: Virtual assistant from somewhere like the Philippines. This should get you the basic legwork done pretty easily without having to do anything yourself.  \n\\- More expensive: outsourced bookkeeper / service / agency: this is where we are now, we pay $2500/month and this includes payroll, bookkeeping, and a bunch of tax account management. Invoicing would be included but ours is a bit too project dependent to reliably outsource currently.\n\nTAX: I don't know where you are at specifically, but this is general advice for US based - the other advantage to a good bookkeeper is to find someone who can manage the tax accounts. Unemployment insurance, state by state accounts if you hire in different locations, and a bunch more. These are just awful to self manage.\n\nLast note: later on, a good bookkeeper can help you level up your financial management of the company. For example if you hire sales people, or some internal operations people you may want to categorize them differently to track a more accurate gross margin vs opex vs net margin. When you do this, reconciling payroll suddenly becomes more complex, which is why you need a good bookkeeper, it unlocks more capability as well as managing the mundane stuff you shouldn't be doing.",

I did it all sales, marketing, admin, support and bookkeeping. As a result, I would be on an install and I would get a sales lead, but then I would get a support call‚Ä¶and it was just too much. I fired myself as the support person, hired someone; and the business grew. Later, I fired myself as the salesperson, then as the marketing person, and finally as the bookkeeper m. Each time I fired myself, the business grew. I finally woke up to the fact that the secret to my success was firing myself.\nThat‚Äôs it, buddy. Time to fire yourself.

I work in this space, and I completely understand wanting to shield your new project from personal opinions until it's stronger. It's a very common feeling.\n\nGrowing from zero while staying anonymous is a specific challenge, but it's 100% doable. It just means you have to be more strategic.\n\nSince you (the founder) are anonymous, your brand has to become the entire personality. Here‚Äôs a game plan.\n\n1. Optimize Your Profile to Be Your \"Face\"\nYour profile is now your entire first impression. Before you do anything else, make this solid.\n\nProfile Pic: Use a clean, clear logo. Don't use a personal photo or a generic stock image.\nUsername: Make it as close to your business name as possible.\n\nBio: This is your elevator pitch. It must be crystal clear. Use this structure:\nLine 1: What you do / Who you help. (e.g., \"Handcrafted ceramic mugs for cozy mornings.\")\nLine 2: The value you provide. (e.g., \"Daily inspiration ‚Ä¢ Pottery tips ‚Ä¢ Shop our drops\")\nLine 3: A Call to Action (CTA). (e.g., \"üëá Shop the new collection\")\nLink in Bio: This should go to your website (once it's ready). For now, you can use a free Linktree/Stan/etc., but a direct website link is always more professional.\n\n2. The \"Cold Start\" Growth Strategy (Getting 0 -&gt; 100)\nYou have no friends/family to tap, so you have to find your first followers \"in the wild.\"\n\nDO NOT: Follow 1,000 random people hoping they follow back. This gets you low-quality followers and can look spammy.\n\nDO THIS INSTEAD (The 10/10/10 Method):\nFind 10 \"competitor\" or \"shoulder\" accounts. These are accounts where your ideal customer already hangs out.\nGo to their most recent posts.\nLeave 10 genuine, thoughtful comments. This is the key. Don't just post \"Nice!\" or a fire emoji. Add to the conversation. If it's a potter, say, \"That's a beautiful glaze technique! Does it work well on stoneware?\"\n\nPeople will see your insightful comment, see your (now optimized) logo/name, get curious, click your profile, and‚Äîif your bio is clear and your content is good‚Äîthey will follow.\n\nThis is the single best way to get your first 100 relevant followers who actually care about what you do\n\n3. Your Content Strategy (Faceless &amp; Valuable)\nYou need to give people a reason to follow you. Your content must provide value. Every post should either Educate, Entertain, or Inspire.\n\nReels are Your #1 Growth Tool: The algorithm pushes Reels to non-followers. This will be your main discovery engine.\n\nFaceless Reel Ideas:\nShow your product in use (a hand holding the mug, not your face).\nShow the process (packing an order, designing on your computer, sketching an idea).\n\nUse text-on-screen with a trending audio to share a quick tip.\nUse high-quality, aesthetic stock video clips (from Pexels or Canva) and add your tips/info as text overlays.\nCarousels are Your #1 Nurture Tool: These are great for your existing followers.\n\nUse them for tutorials, step-by-step guides, myth-busting, or sharing a list of resources. These get a lot of saves, which the algorithm loves.\n\nUse Canva: You can create 90% of your graphics and simple video content in Canva. It's all you need to look professional without being a graphic designer.\n\n4. How to Be Found (Hashtags)\nHashtags are how you tell Instagram what your post is about. Don't use massive tags like #business (100M+ posts). You'll be invisible.\n\nUse a \"niche-down\" strategy. In each post, use a mix of 10-15 tags:\n\nBroad (3-5): #[your_industry] (e.g., #pottery)\nNiche (5-7): #[your_specific_product] (e.g., #handmademugs, #ceramicart)\nCommunity (3-5): #[your_target_audience] (e.g., #pottersofinstagram, #coffeelovers)\n\nThe biggest thing is consistency. It's a marathon. You're starting on \"hard mode,\" which is slower, but it's so much more rewarding. You'll know that every single follower and sale was 100% earned by your own effort and the quality of your brand.\n\nYou've got this. Good luck.",
