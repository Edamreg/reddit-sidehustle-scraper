      "selftext": "Real talk, podcasting doesn’t get enough credit as a side hustle. Everyone’s chasing dropshipping or freelancing, but a simple niche podcast can actually stack up fast if you’re consistent.\n\nI started mine talking about random stuff I was already into, didn’t expect much, but it picked up once I started uploading to Spotify, YouTube, and a few other platforms. Between listener support, affiliate plugs, and platform monetization, it turned into a decent passive stream.\n\nIf you’ve got something to say (or even just a hobby you rant about with friends), record it. You don’t need crazy gear either (I even started recording using my crappy Blackshark gaming headphone)\n\nAnyway, I'm on my 3rd month of earning over $500 a month. Not enough to pay all the bills, but it does help w groceries and other random expenses",

      "selftext": "Background: I run a small international snack brand called Pop Snax, which I started 2 years ago. Initial operations were out of my apartment where snacks took up every inch of space, lol. I've grown steadily over the last year, and I'm now working out of a co-warehouse space.\n\nAnyway, last Sunday, something wild happened. A huge influencer (Joe Bartolozzi) who randomly ordered one of my mystery snack boxes in August, unboxed it on stream/Youtube. Had no idea who he was so I had no idea he was even placing an order. Within hours, my website traffic exploded. Shopify was dinging nonstop.. I got over 300 orders in two days. I was super confused at first and asked a customer how they found me, and that's when I found out about the influencer unboxing.\n\nI cried almost constantly for the first 2 days bc this was one of those surreal “this is actually happening” moments, and I had no idea what I'd done to deserve this. Since last Sunday, orders have been heavy and consistent and the video featuring my box has hit 850k views!\n\nWhile running the business, I also work a full-time job, so, I've been running on fumes trying to keep up with customer emails, packing, and fulfilling, often late into the night. It's been exciting, but also kind of chaotic.\n\nAnyway, this viral moment has given me my first real taste of HEAVY demand at scale, but its also exposed how under-resourced I am as a solopreneur. I don’t have a team yet, or fulfillment support, and I’m still figuring out how to maintain that momentum after the viral wave calms down.\n\nEven with the boost, I know growth won't be linear. There’s still the day-to-day grind I'm trying to figure out, i.e. running ads, improving packaging, managing costs, dealing with platform issues (looking at you, Amazon 😅), and trying to make every customer happy. I'm trying to get deep into AI, so I can offload some of that pressure/manual oversight.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything! And if anyone else here has gone viral with a product or business, how did you handle the surge? Did you manage to sustain it afterward?",

Find some students to come help with packing and shipping so you can focus on the more strategic work.  Get some lined up, explaining the work will be sporadic.  Only bring them in when the surge in orders will cover the staffing expense.  If you can afford it, pay some for a few hours of training so they are ready when you need manpower\nInstall cameras in your work areas so you can keep an eye on them… you’ll soon see which are worth keeping around. Identify not only those who are good at the packing, shipping etc, but also look for those who have an “ownership mindset” who think like business people and who bring their brain to the job, not just the muscle.\nWhen you find those exceptional “owners” invest in mentoring them, involve them in marketing g and inventory and anything else you can expose them too… they become your key employees\nTry to complement your skills.if you are a great marketer, look for bookkeeping instincts.  If you love sourcing new products and managing pipelines. Look for online marketing thinkers\nInvest as much profit as you can into staffing, if you staff right, that will drive growth faster than anything\nAnd, if you don’t have a detailed business plan, write one.  The better you are at identifying key milestones and inflection points, the faster you will build the business. every library has books on writing business plans… take this step seriously and it will pay off.\nFinally, as soon as time allows, get yourself an advisory board; potential\nMentors with experience in areas you don’t know well.  They can help you refine your planning, help you avoid the predictable mistakes most new business owners make, and make connections that will support your businesses growth.  I’m not talking about big name advisors, I mean a friend of your parent who is a CPA, a local shopowner who understands cash flow, a retired exec who can help with strategy and bank contacts, etc.\nGood luck!",

I’d recommend not going for copywriting, dropshipping, reselling etc… every top g with an online university is teaching that shit and it’s such an overcrowded space where only a select few actually get good cash. My recommendations would bet to go for an actually desired skill that you can scale and start freelancing. For example: digital art (if u’re good at drawing or are willing to learn), 3d designing in blender, video editing, thumbnail designing, logo designing, album cover art designing, website development, and there’s just so much more this is just to name a few.\n\nSeriously, don’t go for copywriting or dropshipping. It’s not only that it’s hard it’s just so oversaturated and luck based. If you actually become good at one of the skills I listed you will have 0 problems in getting paid as long as your work is good. It’s not easy, it’s not a “get rich quick” scheme, but if you are actually trying to build something without depending on luck it’s the best option. Also you would be really surprised on how good you can get in a couple of months with focused effort. Im well off working full time as a video editor now and I still wish I started earlier myself.",

Around where I live in Liverpool daily if walk down different streets close to my house and virtually every single house or flat has been given their own wheelie bins and not just one each they've usually got 3 each or sometimes 2 each! \nOne for general waste, one for recycling and the other for gardening waste! \nAnd I noticed quite often I'd walk past certain wheelie bins and there would be a terrible smell coming from them! Even when they where empty and had the lids closed! \nAnd I know that's probably through no fault of their own, because obviously stuff get out inside the bins that is is going to have a bad smell sometimes. It's only normal!! \n\nBut then I thought to myself.........I've never actually seen anybody at all in my local area specifically! Cleaning out their wheelie bins! \n\nI mean, have you ever seen anyone cleaning their wheelie bins? \nIt's not the nicest job, it's dirty and it stinks and nobody wants to do it do they, but!!! If I asked around the houses in the streets in my local area first. In a small radius of my own house and/or advertised wheelie bin cleaning to your door! Possibly starting at £4 per bin?! I don't know?! \nTo start off with I personally think all id need to clean people's wheelie bins is a bucket, I a large sponge or a few, a large scourer or scrubbing implement (or possibly a few) \nSome overalls (or Personal protective equipment) \n\nSome latex gloves or even some marigolds would suffice!  And maybe sometimes I might require a face mask. And some cleaning agent or other dependant on what the local council's guidelines are on stuff like that, if your allowed to use bleach or not I don't know it would have to be researched!!\n\nAnd I thought initially you could go house to house and if they agree to have a wheelie bin or two or three cleaned by myself all I would need to do is ask them to put some hot water in my empty bucket (like the window cleaners do at every single house) \n\nAnd get the wheelie bin flat on the floor and get on my hands and knees and get it cleaned with a bit of elbow grease! \nI'm not scared of a bit of hard work and some horrible smells sometimes haha! \n\nSo if they agreed to have one bin cleaned that would be £4 per house\n2 bins is £8 per house \n3 bins is £12 per house, \nThen you work out how many houses would actually agree to have their wheelie bins cleaned, because it's not a job anyone really wants to do. And like I said in the beginning.....I've never actually ever seen anyone ever cleaning their wheelie bins! \n\nI've had a quick look into it in my area of Liverpool and there's not any regular wheelie bin cleaners and it would hopefully be a very low start up cost when starting out if all I used was a bucket I carried around containing my sponges or scourers or scrubbing brushes plus the correct cleaning agents that is permitted by my local council. \nAnd my gloves and overalls. (Personal protective equipment):\n\nAnd that's it! \n\nObviously if it took off and a lot of locals did want their bins cleaning I could then possibly increase the prices per bins to maybe £5 per bin, £6 per bin, I don't know, and you could possibly have a few extras that could have an extra cost maybe £1/£2 per bin for a spray of an air freshener that maybe includes an antibacterial property when their bin has finished being cleaned? \nI dunno just a thought!\n\nYou could also maybe sell numbers or stickers that can be bought for an extra cost for each bin with their house number stuck on the sides or something like that? \n\n\nWhat do people think about this for an idea of a start up business? \n\nObviously when and if I can hopefully start earning an income I can then buy the business a pressure washer or a trolley with a handle I can wheel round with me with my equipment on it. \n\nBut I really do think it could take off. Especially where I live. Due to the fact that I said many houses wheelie bins smell bad and are really dirty as expected, but I've never seen anyone cleaning them! \n\nAnd then this could be a regular service, maybe once a month or fortnightly or even weekly if the customer wanted! \n\nI think I'm going to do as much research into the idea as I can during the winter months and get as much information from the local council and try getting things set up for myself and get some advertising and marketing made up so I'm ready to launch this little business when the weather starts to warm up. \n\nGet some promotions figured out and set up. \n\nI'm really looking forward to it, and if all else fails......I won't of spent a lot of money and lost it. \n\n\nCan anyone give me any thoughts on what they think personally please? Id really appreciate it! Thanks",

If you are super stressed though your blood pressure might be too high to get it done. I had a bad week at work and couldn’t get it done at all that week 😥. \n\nSurveys aren’t what they used to be. They use to ask you all qualifiers at the beginning and now they ask you some at the end so they don’t have to pay you. If you are just going to waste time in an attempt to make money, you would have better time using ai to create some funny shorts for tiktok instead. \n\nIf you like to play games on phone try testerup/copper kind of apps. You won’t get paid a lot or fast but at least you can turn some of your gaming time into cash. \n\nWith some caution, check out facebook marketplace and Craigslist for jobs and free items you could resell near you. \n\nYou can also look into clinical trials, but always remember they could go bad. Had my asthma get worse doing one trial so I haven’t done one since. \n\nIf you aren’t continuing to rack up debt, then try debt consolidation to help lower what you owe back and make payments more manageable. Once you do that only keep one credit card and cancel the rest. Temptation is too strong. \n\nIf you can drive you might want to look into an old but decent car. Try brands that are easy to get replacement parts for and fix yourself. Be careful of dodge’s battery placement type things 😑. If not and biking isn’t an option, maybe see about carpooling with someone who lives near you. Offer to pay them so much a week to tag a long. My hubby takes 3 to work and they each give him $20/week so it pays the weekly gas costs. \n\nI hope it gets better for everyone and soon.

You can state what you want to earn per hour or per job or say you need to make an estimate and put your phone number.

Brands don’t pay for reach anymore; they pay for trust and niche relevance. Pick one theme your audience really vibes with, double down on that, and start treating your content like a mini brand, not a hobby. Once you’ve got that clear identity, even small collabs turn into long-term gigs. Most creators get stuck chasing numbers instead of building leverage.",

Theres plenty of TikTok accounts of moms making food for their kids, doing mom housework etc. but you could stand out by cooking real good food. Most of those TikTok’s are just a woman heating up pizza pockets and pouring some chips onto a plate and calling it “lunch”. If you’re actually a good cook you could tap into that market. Show prep, show the cooking process for both your husband and kid’s food, show the cleanup, etc. brand them in different ways. Maybe one TikTok is about a quick meal you can make in 20m that’s still healthy. Make “games,” out of it for better content. For example, pull random ingredients out of your cupboards and pantry. Then cook a legit meal with those random ingredients. Title it something like “no groceries, no problem! A healthy weekday meal in 30 minutes with random ingredients from the pantry!” Or something. \n\nWhat do you post on your YouTube channel? Try double uploading when you make new videos/shorts. Instead of uploading only to YouTube you can use apps that will upload to multiple platforms at the same time. I’d start with YouTube shorts (as that sounds like what you’re making already) TikTok and Instagram reels\n\nRecord and edit multiple videos then schedule them as uploads. This way you can make a ton of content on that 1 day a week, then gradually publish them throughout the week until your next content creation day. Though obviously change outfits and etc so it seems like another day.",

I got into that world myself after losing my job a while back (different niche, same idea), and honestly, it’s what gave me back some control over my schedule and income. You’ve already got the content and the skillset, maybe just a shift in how you use them.\n\nIf you research that space a bit, you’ll see a ton of creative ways moms are building flexibility into their lives.

My doorbell rang and I opened the door... A 20 year old woman, blond hair, maybe 120 lbs, in pink rubber overalls, long eyelashes and I swear there was glitter. She looked like Barbie. She said, I am here to fix your septic. I looked in the driveway for someone else, assuming she was assisting. Nope, all I say was a white and pink pickup truck. I went back in the house. 1 hour later doorbell rings. She said all fixed, she rebuilt biofilter and tested all systems. I had to ask. I told her I was not expecting her when I was told someone was coming. She said instead of going to college like her friends she worked entry level at a septic company making $20 per hour. Now, 3 years later she makes $45 per hour and %20 of all repairs. Last year she made just shy of $140k. She said they cant find enough employees.. And she makes 3x the $ her college graduate friends make. I have experienced the same thing before with an 18 year old HVAC tech, who made $75 per hour. Not enough people. And a 24 year old electrician. How is it possible not to make 100k as a yound healthy adult?",

      "selftext": "The idea came from someone that runs a disney holidays comparison website. She makes about 3k a month from the website while working about 3-4 hours a month on it. Most of her traffic comes from SEO which means that she barely has any costs. She earns a commission when users book through her affiliate links to sites like Booking.com.\n\nThis sounds awesome but the intitial work she put in was massive. Months and months of content writing.\n\nFor the last year I've been deep diving in vibe coding. I have some previous experience with SEO. I heard about her succesfull project and thought well I can do that as well without grinding as much.  I'll let AI do the website coding (no wordpress or CMS) and the content writing (using markdown format).\n\nThere are javascript libaries that allow you to load markdown as SEO optimized content on a web project. Lots of frontend developers have blogs that use this structure. Yet this structure is barely used in the affiliate marketing/SEO world.\n\nOf course I couldnt just copy her niche, that wouldnt be fair so I came up with a similiair yet different niche. A theme park the size of a disney theme park but a little less known. I expect to make about 1500 dollar a month from this project at the end of next year.\n\nMy first step was to create a rock-solid plan. I spent a few hours outlining a detailed, phased plan for the entire project. This document detailed the exact folder structure, the required reusable components like headers and footers. (all done with the help of my friend Google Gemini). next step was the split the plan in different phases and let my AI assistants complete the development for each phase.\n\nWhile the coding AI was churning out pages, I put another AI to work on the content. I gave it the topics and keywords, and it wrote all the descriptions for the accommodations, the SEO texts for the pages, and several blog posts, all formatted in Markdown. This content is loaded directly into the website (using mdx), no complex CMS needed.\n\nFrom the initial idea to a fully functional, content-rich website deployed on Vercel for free, the entire process took just under two weeks.\n\nI'm currently letting Google index my project and have more content to be published in my pipeline. So far the project looks incredibly promising. Will share more results once I have them.",

      "selftext": "Over the years, I explored many side hustles, including dropshipping, freelancing, affiliate marketing, and print-on-demand. I felt that whenever I discovered a promising opportunity, something kept me from pursuing it. Whether it was a complex technology, a disheartening market, or something else entirely, I kept running into barriers.\n\nFor the most part, I learned how to establish websites, develop ads, and master the marketing, but I simply wasn’t making any sales. I earned a few bucks here and there, enough to convince myself I was building a proper business, but it was so erratic and inconsistent that it hardly felt like I was constructing anything with real value.\n\nI learned how to reduce the steps I needed to take in order to begin making a profit, and this made all the difference. I identified a niche market for products I could easily acquire, which made it possible for me to concentrate on building the store and doing the marketing, all without the hassle of inventory, packing, or shipping. I was able to keep the expenses low and avoid any overly complex technology.\n\nI started an online store for easy-to-source, in-demand products. I set up my store and automated portions of my business using AI-powered tools. I could list all my products, set prices, and arrange store layout in just a couple of minutes. I felt like I was finally getting there.\n\nThe first sale was monumental and from there I was able to shift my focus to product marketing and optimizing my ads. Over time my sales started to increase consistently and I honed my skills in overall process optimization. I began my store with a small inventory of predominantly accessories and home décor and gradually added products after identifying market demand.\n\nThe journey was not easy, but my efforts paid off. I built a low-risk, low-cost business by focusing on products for which I could avoid manufacturing and storage. With everything in place, I was able to avoid technical distractions and focus on increasing my business scale.\n\nIf you’re over 35 and seeking solutions, I understand. I have gone through years of trial and error, and it is only recently that I have been able to where I want to be. But once I found my niche and acquired the appropriate tools to streamline the process, all the pieces started to fall into place. I now operate my online store full-time, earning more than I did during my 9-5, and have been able to create something that is profitable, sustainable, and in my control, which is a rewarding experience.",

There are now over 6,000 farts logged from 100 countries, and I’ve added a few new features: Pull My Finger (a random fart generator), Fart Confessions (where people anonymously share their funniest or most awkward fart stories)  \n  \nTotal earnings so far: $20.63 from affiliate clicks. Not life-changing, but it’s doubled as both a comedy experiment and a legit lesson in niche engagement and passive monetization.\n\nStill chasing that $1,000 goal.. one fart at a time. tuute ceo",

I stayed over, and he took his family somewhere the next morning as I was leaving, and his wife sat in the passenger seat and released The Second Wave.™ Proudest fart ever. We still talk about it, and he refuses to hang out with me after I've had that pizza.",

          "body": "You’re right to call out the hype. Most “passive” plays are either thinly veiled affiliate promos or labor-intensive side businesses that only feel passive after heavy upfront work. The forex replies here reinforce the problem: unlimited upside claims ignore risk, drawdowns, and the operational stress of active trading. And the linked survey and crypto pages are essentially low-yield churn or gambling, not durable income streams.\n\nA more pragmatic lens is to evaluate opportunities by four variables: ongoing maintenance load, reliable distribution, platform dependency risk, and capital intensity. Dividends from broad ETFs score well because ops load is low and distribution is built in. Modestly scoped SaaS with annual billing can be semi-passive if retention and support stay manageable. Evergreen content or IP that ranks for stable search intent can compound, provided you avoid platform whiplash. Real estate becomes semi-passive with competent property management, but capital and local risk matter.\n\nTakeaway: define “passive” as income decoupled from your time after a build phase, then choose one asset where you can win on distribution and retention, not hype. If you cannot clearly outline maintenance, acquisition, and platform risks in a one-page model, it is not passive.",

You try everything for few days or maybe 2 months and then you quit because you don’t see results, so how will you make money??\n\nMost of you have tried affiliate marketing, freelancing, CPA, etc. Guess what, you made $0. \n\nThe main reason is because you are either not taking action or you’re taking actions on the wrong things. For example, if you want to make money online with freelancing, you must know how to position yourself where the demand is and the skills/supply is limited. That’s how you make money on sites like Fiverr, upwork, etc.\n\nFor affiliate marketing, you can’t be promoting what everyone is promoting using free traffic and expect to make a dime, it doesn’t work that way. Promote a new product with paid traffic or with a strategic free traffic source like your own facebook group, YouTube channel, TikTok page, etc.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is your twist to the process that makes you money. For example recently I started promoting a browser and I made money online the first day. This is because the product is new and it is something people would be interested in.\n\nMy advice to anyone who is serious with making money online is that you should start by promoting value before you promote and offer. Only try free traffic if the product you’re promoting is Free.\n\nI’ll end my rant here!!\n\nAsk me questions if any.\n\n\nI come in peace.",

      "selftext": "So, quick backstory: I left my software dev job about 6 months ago. Sometimes feel like the worst decision of my life but whatever. I liked programming itself but hated everything around it. The meetings, the fake enthusiasm, the DSA grind every time you switch jobs, the feeling that nothing you build actually matters. I was an average dev and just couldn’t see myself doing the whole “leetcode 200 questions” cycle again, and that too for the REST OF MY MISERBALE LIFE. (Sorry if I offended any sw devs, but please bare with me, I just can't with this job anymore).\n\nAfter 3 years full-time I decided I’d had enough. Took a month off to reset and didn’t even open my laptop.\n\nThen I started thinking about what I actually enjoy. I’ve always loved puzzles. Sudoku, cryptograms, riddles, logic stuff, all thanks to my dad. He would come home from work and first thing he picked was the newspaper to solve crosswords.. He used to tell me, “You gotta move your brain as much as you move your body,” never really understood what it meant when I was child but now I see it.\n\nSo I built something around that. I made something that people like me will enjoy. A puzzle kit where you can solve puzzles and ultimately the mystery.\n\n# How it started\n\nGot together with 2 of my friends who were just as do-nothing as me. One's working on deciding the storyline, one on marketing and one on coding. The first release in June sold 5 copies. I almost quit right there, but instead decided to tweak everything. Reworked the puzzles, improved the design, rewrote some of the story, and re-released it. That version sold 454 copies. Not life-changing money, but 454 x $25 is a solid amount for a small team where we live.\n\nWe put everything we made back into the next version. We’ve just released version 3 about 10–12 days ago, and we’re already past 150 sales. I know it might sound small, but for three people who used to show up late to the office, miss deadlines, and constantly disappoint  families, even 2 sales felt like a win at one point.\n\n# What worked for us\n\n**1. Researching the market**  \nWe spent time reading forums and watching how people talk about puzzles. Found out that most puzzle lovers actually want a story or some sense of progression, not just random brain teasers. That’s how we came up with the idea of a connected mystery instead of a random puzzle pack.\n\n**2. Understanding the audience**  \nWe lurked in puzzle communities, ARG groups, and subreddits just to listen. Turns out, people didn’t want super hardcore escape-room puzzles. They wanted something relaxing but clever. That feedback changed our tone and visuals completely. We're constantly working on improving our storylines. \n\n**3. Studying competitors**  \nWe bought a few puzzle kits from bigger names and paid attention to what worked and what didn’t. A lot of them had either great puzzles with boring stories or great stories with lazy puzzles. We tried to strike a balance. But hey, they're doing something right!\n\n# Marketing (our toughest dragon to slay)\n\n**YouTube** – Tried posting short funny puzzle-related videos, but our channel got deleted because YT said we were “trying to take traffic off-platform.” That was a big loss because we actually saw a small bump from it before it went down ( I know, our fault, should've read the guidelines before, but who has time for that). Might create another one without actually trying to steal their audience.\n\n**Reddit** – Surprisingly helpful. Our first few posts here got a bit of traction and led to real customers. Had few lashbacks as well, cuz we were sounding too much like an ad. Think about the customers, before you think about the product.\n\n**Discord** – Still trying to figure it out. We made a small community but engagement is low (0). Probably need to give people more reasons to hang around beyond just solving puzzles. We're actively working on figuring out how to not just sell puzzles but actually create a community.\n\n**Twitter** – Haven't fully started. Still trying to figure this out.\n\n**Instagram / Meta ads** – This was the biggest driver of traffic. We ran small $10–$20/day ads and kept testing creatives. What worked best were short clips of the puzzles with captions like “Can you solve this?” followed by a mystery hook.\n\n**Hiring** – Hired winners from 2nd puzzle to work for us for promotion. They're learning, so are we. We have decided to hire more.\n\n# Where we’re at now\n\nWe’ve saved enough to last a few months and we’re using all business income for business expenses. The goal is to grow a small but loyal community instead of chasing quick sales.\n\nIt’s still early, and we have no idea if this will turn into something considerable, but it’s the first time in years we’ve actually been excited to wake up and work.\n\n3 \"devs\" , trying to figure out something other than being passed commands and then chatgpting the solution. Hoping we won't ever have to go back to office chairs, teams calls (I can still hear their audio in my head), waking up feeling scared if today will be the day I'll be thrown out. I mean, we are jobless right now as well, and we're not earning as much as we used too, but happiness matters right? Right ???",

Join programs like Amazon Associates or FlexOffers and start promoting products you'd recommend.  You can promote via social media or using your own blog/website. Check out YouTube for free tutorials on how to go about it. \n\nSupplement that with micro tasks, focus groups, and get-paid-to sites. You can do this in your spare time since the earnings are usually small. I personally do this and make about $200-300 a month.

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training glfrom beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free! At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

It's a form of arbitrage, and it can make you an extra couple hundred each month. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives those offers higher, creating more opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how it works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them.

The bonusarb guide currently highlights SoFi Plus where you spend $10 and get $30 back, and a higher payout Chime offer that requires redirecting an employer direct deposit to earn around $390. These stack, but you need to track terms, KYC, payout timing, and tax implications. The aggregator they reference (Gemsloot) handles offer tracking and withdrawals; still, incentives change and dry up when the acquisition budget shifts.\n\nVideo editing is a better bet if you niche down. Short-form repurposing for local businesses or niche creators is not saturated when you anchor to outcomes: editing pipeline, caption templates, hooks per industry, and weekly analytics. Distribution matters more than craft alone.\n\nOffline, vending is capital intensive but can be defensible with the right placements. Expect a grind in securing locations and negotiating splits before it feels passive.\n\nIf you want “slow growth” with low cash, pick one skill with compounding leverage, aim for repeatable deliverables, and attach to an existing demand stream. Arbitrage is fine for quick wins. Durable income comes from owning a tight problem and a simple system to solve it.",

Think of it as a journey a place to be creative, experiment, and be okay with failing fast so you can learn what doesn’t work.\n\nStart with your “why.” Why do you want to do this, and who do you want to help? Define your ideal customer, the lifestyle you want, and what your business should look like in 5–10 years. Then break that vision down into small, manageable steps you can take one at a time.\n\nAll businesses share the same core structure: marketing, sales, operations, and cash flow. Cash flow is what keeps you in the game without it, even the best idea fails. So you need to understand your margins, because that’s what drives profit and profit is what lets you grow and scale sustainably.\n\nThe key is to find a niche where you can stand out. Be better at something, improve something, or serve a specific type of customer in a unique way. Focus on building a brand because brands create trust, and trust allows you to charge more than your competitors. Without a brand, your only advantage is price, and that’s a race to the bottom.\n\nFinally, test everything. Start small, see what gets traction, and double down on what works. No one will tell you what’s working right now that’s the business world’s best-kept secret but everyone will tell you what used to work.",

It doesn't have the potential to scale to something huge like starting your own business, but those things can also just end up paying nothing. There are lots of platforms, with varying rates, rules, structure, etc. Data Annotation Tech, Mercor, Mindrift, Telus International are some. You can search reddit and find huge lists of companies that hire for this and then look for what suits you best. You don't need to learn new skills. You do need to be detail-oriented and meticulous, reading and following the instructions and checking back about this frequently.",

          "body": "You are right to be wary of dropshipping and “overnight” plays. A realistic path for an apartment-friendly side income is to start with a narrow, outcome-based service that compounds into assets. Pick one customer profile where you already have familiarity, then offer a clear result such as “launch a fast WordPress store in 7 days with basic SEO and Stripe.” The WooCommerce plus Elementor stack is free to start, low friction, and gives you speed and control without deep coding.\n\nUse her sales strength to run short, targeted outreach to 30 prospects in that niche. Keep it human and specific: problem, outcome, timeline, price. Your tech role is delivery and iteration. Track three numbers from day one: response rate, conversion rate, and delivery hours. When you can repeat the same workflow reliably, turn the process into a productized package and a simple checklist, then add a small upsell like basic email capture or a one-page SEO refresh.\n\nIf you want a purely side income stream to bridge the early months, data annotation platforms can be a pragmatic filler, but they are not passive and quality varies. Treat them as temporary cash flow, not a core business.",

(See picture in the link for proof.) At first I wasn’t making as much but if you’re willing to invest a bit or time and money, you can easily get your money back fairly quickly. I broke even around 6 months. Now I can’t guarantee any specific time frame, just because there are so many factors, but it’s def possible. So how does it work? The investments you make are for actually physical real miners that the company holds in a number of warehouses (and you can even watch a live stream of the miners and can see whenever someone is working on them) and takes care of them. So investment literally buy you actual miners (but you won’t have to deal with any maintenance or electricity. We pay the company a small percentage of our earnings to cover all that. So you could literally sign up, buy your first miner, set it to reinvest in TH (more TH = More $), and just leave it in a closet and it will continue to make you money! Now it’s not going to be the quickest option, but the point is that your account just continues to get more and more profitable over time. Plus, they are just really a great company to work with!\n\nIf any of you are at all interested in signing up, please just DM me here or on Discord at: Smaug\\_LegendsOTM and I’ll help answer any questions/guidance you might have/need, including how to sign up and get the most benefits right off the top!

I started about a month and a half ago and I’m about 500-600 in profit. \nThis is if you have extra money lying around outside of your monthly spendings though, i would not recommend this if your budget is tight because sometimes they take a while to sell and the shoes are just sitting there",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training glfrom beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free! At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

On a good month I can earn 2k, usually about 30/hr depending on the project and if I put my mind to it.\n\nIt started as a small side gig, but it made me realize I actually can make decent money online. Now I can’t stop thinking about whether I could turn this into something full-time or move into other kinds of online work like e-commerce, freelancing, or anything else that’s flexible.\n\nI’m not trying to chase easy money, I just feel like I’d learn more building things and experimenting than sitting through lectures that don’t connect to anything. Also, the corporate world sounds horrible for me and my mental health.\n\nFor anyone who’s dropped out, freelances full-time, or runs something online:\n\nHow did you figure out what to focus on? Did you wait until you were making enough to drop out, or just go for it?\n\nNot trying to promote anything here, just trying to figure out my next move.

I could play the role of this person in their life and basically try to be in character and allow them to just yell at me and make their 'jerk store' arguments to, about whatever has got them pissed as a form of release.  \n\nThough, it would get draining and I'm not really trained to do try and help folks like that.  \n\nIt also occurred to me that some ppl just need someone to tell them to get shit done.  There could be like a drill sergeant variation of this.  Call them at 5am, make sure they get up, do some pushups and take a shower and what not.  Call out their excuses for not doing shit and just try to get their ass in gear and into a routine.  I guess this is already describing a \"life coach\" or something though.",

You look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them.

Needless to say, I failed at most of them, except blogging; I did make some money with it.\n\nThen finally, something clicked, and I started making consistent money. It all started when I purchased an eBook (can’t remember the title now) for $10; it was about creating and selling books on Amazon.\n\nI took action and created multiple books and published them via CreateSpace (now merged into KDP). I still remember the very first month I made $1.44 in book royalties. Then around $13 during the second month. Soon, I was making a couple of hundred bucks every single month.\n\nI still create and publish books on Amazon via KDP and make anywhere between $300 to $700 every month. I know it’s a very small amount, but it does help me and my family.\n\nThe other two side hustles that worked for me include Affiliate Marketing and Digital Product selling.\n\nSo, basically, I do these three things to make a decent monthly income.\n\nI would like to know what side hustles or passive/active income ideas you guys are focusing on and what’s working best for you.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nSubha",

          "body": "I have to say KDP was my first success, too. I started a few years ago but it got really crowded fast. Today there are a few sales here and there but nothing spectacular. But by being very consistent with publishing while niching down heavily you can still be somewhat successful. At my time it was actionable reports and guides for local service providers wanting to improve parts of their business. Everybody doing KDP should definetly go with their promo offerings and KDP Unlimited, expand to other platforms and utilize deal platforms for more exposure. If it's educational stuff, it always made sense to publish some sort of series that handles different parts and processes towards some goal. That stuff that can be combined into nice bundles that offer real value. Also people love unexpected freebies. Link inside your publications to video content, tools and printables that complement your content whenever you see fit. Give your readers something to implement/work on after consuming your stuff so that they benefit from your advice as fast as possible. Also ask for reviews, without reviews there are no sales, especially on Amazon. To get started give your publications away for free in exchange for reviews. That makes a huge difference. It's absolutely necessary to get some proof from real people. My last point: Spend time on your branding and establish as many touchpoints as possible. When someone wants to be educated by a brand, he should find a decent first page communicating that he's in the right place with you when googling your brand name. Good luck to everybody trying. Make it work.",

And i say this to you cause I do this for because I have been doing this for almost 2 years and monthly I fluctuate between €4000 and €6000 per month but the relatively interesting thing is that it is a method of earning that is risk-free because mainly what you do is cover all the outcomes of that match obviously using other bookmakers so you have the security not only of not losing the money you have bet but of unlocking the bonus in real balance.",

          "body": "I recently starting working as a court transcriptionist, which is fully remote. I am technically still in training, which lasts a month or two (depends on how fast you are). \n\nI am sent court audio files, and I am supposed to transcribe them into a specific format, which can take a bit of time. It pays $2 per page, each page usually has between 200-300 words on it, and so how much you get paid depends on how fast you can type. If the audio file is clear, I can do some pages in one minute, but if the audio is hard to hear and I have to go back and listen over and over, it can take several minutes. And then you have to go back and proof read and make sure the formatting is right, which adds to the time. \n\nIt's obviously better if you can type fast, I'm only at 65 wpm (slow for this kind of work), but there's room to grow and get better. I bought a foot pedal to pause audio, which also helps with speed. It was $70, but definitely worth it! I bought two other cheaper ones that didn't work with the audio software. Other than that, I have not paid anything for this job, not the classes or training. \n\nOverall, I am liking it. It is fully remote, I'm even allowed to travel, and I don't have to \"work\" with anyone except over email or zoom for instructions/ classes. There are no benefits like healthcare, it's contractor work (1099), and you have to pay your own taxes, but you also get to set your own schedule. As long as you submit the transcript before it's due, you're free to work as much or little as you want. \n\nAnother downside to consider, you are listening to court cases that contain sensitive information and details of crimes. Not for everyone, and can be difficult to listen to sometimes. \n\nI'm only a month into training, so still new. Hopefully it works out. I was also doing freelance transcription work, which is remote and doesnt cost anything to start. It pays a lot less, but it's also less strict, and a lot of the audios are short and easy.",

I brushed it off because Pinterest seemed like a platform for recipes and home decor, not finance content.\n\nAfter 8 months my blog was still under 500 monthly visitors from Google. SEO is slow and competitive in finance niche.\n\nFinally tried Pinterest out of desperation. Created 20 pins, joined some Communities via Tailwind, posted consistently for 30 days.\n\nMonth 1 results:\n\n- 1,847 visitors from Pinterest\n- 89 email subscribers\n- 2 affiliate commissions\n\nPinterest traffic in one month exceeded 8 months of SEO traffic. I wasted 8 months ignoring my friend's advice because of assumptions about what Pinterest was for.\n\nNow at month 6:\n\n- 8.2K monthly Pinterest visitors\n- 450 email subscribers total\n- $340 monthly affiliate income\n\nPinterest is my main traffic source now. Google brings maybe 600 visitors monthly while Pinterest brings 8K+.\n\nThe lesson: Don't dismiss platforms based on stereotypes. Test them and see actual results.\n\nWish I'd started Pinterest when my friend first suggested it. Would be 6 months ahead now.\n\nWhat advice did you ignore that you later regretted?

Most of her traffic comes from SEO. The revenue model is mainly affiliate commissions.\n\nI heard about her succesfull project and thought well I can do that as well. I'll let AI do the website coding (no wordpress or CMS) and the content writing (using markdown format).\n\nThere are javascript libaries that allow you to load markdown as SEO optimized content on a web project. Lots of frontend developers have blogs that use this structure. Yet this structure is barely used in the affiliate marketing/SEO world.\n\nOf course I couldnt just copy her niche, that wouldnt be fair so I came up with a similiair yet different niche. A theme park the size of a disney theme park but a little less known.\n\nSomething to point out here is that her (and my) platform are not in English. This makes it a lot easier to rank due to less competition and lower content saturation in that language market.\n\n# Building the website\n\nMy first step was to create a rock-solid plan. I spent a few hours outlining a detailed, phased plan for the entire project. This document detailed the exact frontend folder structure, the required reusable components like headers and footers. (all done with the help of my friend Google Gemini). next step was to split the plan in different phases and let my AI assistants complete the development for each phase.\n\n# Content writing\n\nWhile the coding AI was churning out pages, I put another AI to work on the content. I gave it the topics and keywords, and it wrote all the descriptions for the accommodations close to the theme park, the SEO texts for the pages, and several blog posts, all formatted in Markdown. This content is loaded directly into the website (using mdx), no CMS needed.\n\nFrom the initial idea to a fully functional, content-rich website deployed on Vercel for free, the entire process took just under two weeks.\n\nI'm currently letting Google index my project and have more content to be published in my pipeline. Will give an update in a few months.\n\n ",

The weird part is, the more it grows, the more I’ve started thinking about how tied up my personal life is with all of it.   \nI’ve seen friends lose half their business after a divorce, and it honestly freaked me out a bit. It’s not even about trust it’s just realizing how fast something you built from scratch can get tangled up in stuff that has nothing to do with work.   \nI’m in a serious relationship now and things are good, but for the first time, I’ve actually caught myself thinking about stuff like prenups or protecting ownership. Never thought I’d be that person, but here we are.\n\nAny other business owners hit that point where you start looking at marriage a little differently once there’s a company involved?",

I am in the process of giving her some shares in one of the companies as a thank-you for the support &amp; the money she lent the company. That aside, my view is that she supported me in making the jump, so if the marriage cards do fall, then, they will fall where they fall. Maybe I will end up with only half a castle, but without her there would be no castle. I guess a lot depends on the level of support you get from the significant other.",

They're not starting with nothing.  Those roots have value.  More so if they're getting married at age 30.  The career push is starting, but the good position was a generational effort and a 20+ year foundation.   \n  \nIn no other business arrangement would you commit yourself to payment obligations for life if the other partner can withdraw all support.   In no other field would you fail to consult an expert.  (If your tooth hurts, see a dentist.  If you need legal work, talk to an attorney.)  \n\nReligion isn't an excuse either.

They outline the finer details you may have glossed over. Everyone just thinks their loved one will be “fair”. But stating it is just so vague. What’s fair to you and your loved one?

Prenups, business contracts, etc. Idc what my brother, sister or wife says about they can’t trust. I can’t trust them if they can’t discuss details of what’s fair.\n\nPlus, contracts hold through time.

Given all of that, when you look in the mirror, can you live with that person (you) if you don't try?  \n\nIf you are doing it to be an entrepreneur, you will most likely fail.  If it's an idea that brings you to this point, that keeps coming back to you, month after month, your odds improve a bit.\n\nThere needs to be some level of love for the work you are doing, or the problem you are solving, because in most cases, there is no more reward than the work.",

Failing is one thing, but giving up is shameful. I tried 5 different entrepreneurial ideas before 1 actually landed. I spent 10s of thousands of dollars, found out who my real friends were and sacrificed my \"Fridays with the boys.\" I would be happy to do it all over again because the one idea I had that landed paid me back 10x long term and has given me more time with my family than I could have ever dreamed of. It's similar to the military in a way. If you sign up and they tell you to do 100 push ups, you do 100 push ups regardless of how long it takes. You could sit there and do 1 every 60 seconds. You could do 2 every 20 minutes. You are not leaving until 100 have been completed because that was the goal. If your goal is to be an entrepreneur, then you will be an entrepreneur. There will be no excuses because your mind won't be able to comprehend it. It's ok to be nervous, it's not ok to never start. If you think it's not for you, then it probably isn't. Have you ever heard a professional athlete say in an interview that they didn't think the sport was for them? No, the first thing they say is they are going to win the championship. If they don't win the championship, they say there's always next year. The goal of an entrepreneur isn't to be the guy in a suit, a $2M mansion, and 6 cars in the garage. If that's why you are doing it, then you will never succeed. The goal of an entrepreneur is to solve people's problems.",

You are the one that needs to make that final call, decision etc. Nobody is there to help you.\n\nPeople get jealous - for this reason, keep everything very private. Especially revenue numbers. Most people just don't understand revenue / gp / np. They look at revenue only and have no idea.\n\nFriends and family etc are not really supporting you. They will be very skeptical. They will be expecting you to fail. They often will not act in a way that will help you.\n\nYou only truly fail when you quit. I have seen so many small business owners start and do ok, but don't have what it takes to keep going when it is a pure grind. It gets boring, very uncomfortable and not worth it. Until you get to a point where you are at a comfortable revenue / gp level that makes sense. You have to be in it for the long haul. For most this is 5+ years.\n\n Many people you deal with are not compatible with you or your company. This goes for customers, staff, friends / family and quite often other businesses. It's fine, don't take anything personally and just move on. Only deal with people that are good, isolate yourself from anyone else however hard that is.\n\nWhen and if you are successful, keep it to yourself. It's nobody's business but your own. The less people you tell, the better your life will be. Most people don't understand money and taxes, especially at a higher level. So if you make a million dollars for example, they would think you are rich. In reality you would need to give away so much of that money to take it, that it is not worth it. Especially when considering the missed opportunities you have when the government takes half of it.\n\nYou are always better off being honest and ethical. People and businesses that do not take this very seriously do not last.",

Whatever time, money, talent and resources you have prepared - you'll need more.

          "body": "Hitting **$2M** in your first year with **26% net margins** and earning investor confidence is not accidental. The title change just exposes a new surface area of decisions. Imposter feelings usually fade when you replace vague pressure with precise operating rhythms. Define your weekly leadership cadence around a few leading indicators that you personally own: qualified pipeline added, customer retention by cohort, payback period on acquisition, and cash runway movement. Keep a short decision journal so you can revisit how you framed choices and what you learned. Build a simple narrative report for your partners each month that ties outcomes to bets, risks, and next actions. That practice compounds credibility with yourself first.\n\nAt the team level, clarify two or three CEO responsibilities that only you can do: set focus, allocate capital, and hire or fire standards. Everything else is delegated with clear success criteria. When impostor thoughts pop up, audit your inputs rather than your identity. Are your customer conversations frequent and structured? Are you segmenting profitability and killing weak lines quickly? Are you running postmortems on misses and publicly adopting the fix?\n\nYou do not need to feel like a CEO to operate like one. Put a simple system in place, let results update the story, and let the title catch up later.",

      "selftext": "Okay so this is kinda wild. I've been messing around with n8n for like 3-4 months now, mostly just building random shit for myself because I'm a nerd and it's fun.\n\nLast month I'm sitting in Starbucks (yeah yeah I know) trying to look productive, and this real estate lady next to me is VENTING to her friend about how she keeps missing leads. Like she's legitimately stressed about it. Something about Zillow inquiries coming in at weird hours and by the time she sees them the next day, people have already connected with other agents.\n\nNow normally I mind my own business but I'd literally just watched a tutorial on webhook automations the night before so I'm like... I could fix that? So I do the awkward lean-over thing and I'm like \"sorry I couldn't help overhearing but I actually build automation stuff, I might be able to help?\"\n\nShe looked at me like I was trying to sell her a timeshare lmao but she gave me her business card anyway.\n\nWhat I actually built her: Basic webhook setup to catch form submissions from her website. Auto-reply email that goes out in like a minute saying \"thanks I got your message, I'll hit you back soon\". Everything dumps into a Google Sheet so she can see all her leads in one place. Her phone gets an SMS whenever a new lead comes in (she LOVED this part). If she doesn't check off that she contacted them within 24hrs, they get an automatic follow-up.\n\nHonest to god it took me maybe 6 hours? And half of that was me googling \"how to format SMS in n8n\" and troubleshooting why the webhook kept timing out , seems i had wrong webhook.\n\nI charged her $450 because I literally had no idea what to charge and that felt like a big number but not TOO big ya know?\n\nPlot twist: Two weeks later she calls me HYPED. Apparently a lead came through at like 11pm on a Saturday night - she was already in bed but got the text, sent a quick reply from her phone, and ended up closing the deal. The commission? Twelve. Thousand. Dollars.\n\nShe literally said \"you just paid for yourself like 25 times over\" and then referred me to two other agents in her office.\n\nIf you're thinking about doing this: Dude just start. Real estate agents need basic stuff, not rocket science. Maybe do a cheap/free first project to get a testimonial and build confidence. These people have actual budgets if you save them time. You don't need to be some automation god, you just gotta solve an actual problem they have.\n\nAnyway I'm rambling but I'm just hyped because this actually worked. Happy to answer questions if anyone wants to try this!",

You've nailed something crucial: the real estate agent pain point is ROI-simple (\"I lost a $12k commission because I missed 11pm\"), which makes it easy to justify payment.\n\n\n\nHere's where this scales:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Immediate opportunities:\\*\\*\n\n1. \\*\\*Recurring revenue model\\*\\*: $99-299/month is nothing for an agent saving 1-2 commissions/year. That $450 one-time fee should become $150/mo (or tiered by number of lead sources they connect).\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Expand vertically fast\\*\\*: Service businesses with \"speed-to-respond\" problems are everywhere - HVAC contractors, plumbers, electricians, car detailing, cleaning services. Google Local Service Ads rewards fastest responders. Same problem, same solution.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Don't just build for one person\\*\\*: Once you have 2-3 case studies in the same vertical, that's your entry point to sell into their networks/associations.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Key growth levers:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Real estate agents have referral networks. One happy agent = 20 referrals in their office\n\n\\- Service contractors all talk to each other at supply shops, trade events\n\n\\- Industry-specific Facebook groups are goldmines for warm outreach\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The catch:\\*\\* If you stay at $450 per client doing custom work, you cap out. The winning path is building 1-2 standardized solutions, documenting the setup process, then selling it at $99-299/month with light support.\n\n\n\nYou've proven the concept. Now systematize it. This could easily become 5-6 figures/year if you focus on one vertical for the next 90 days.",

          "body": "Very valid point. Entrepreneurship is one of those things that will definitely let your insecurities creep up to the surface, and you will doubt yourself a million times along the way.\n\n  \nHowever, there are a few things that I feel have helped me:\n\n1. Rather than trying to build a business, obsess over an idea. Find an idea that you know the world will be better for it, then go out there and make it a reality. The belief in the idea and its importance will help you overcome those dark days\n\n2. Surround yourself with a solid support system. I am not just talking about loved ones (those are important); I am talking about other entrepreneurs and business people. Entrepreneurship can be a lonely journey some times, and during those periods, you want to be able to reach out to other people who will understand what you are going through. Better yet, they can give you feedback and let you know if your business has room for growth\n\n3. Whether you are building a product or offering a service, always try to focus on small metrics rather than drastic ones. For instance, if you are doing an outreach campaign, a mistake I see is founders focusing on number of calls booked. Instead, start small and focus on number of email opens and try to improve that. Once you feel that has been improved enough, work on the email's copy and start measuring number of link clicks. If you keep working on these smaller elements, the bigger picture will take care of itself.\n\nThe bottom line is that entrepreneurship is all about grit. That matters more than intelligence and more than having a great idea.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I just need to get this off my chest because I’m honestly so frustrated with trying to make money. I started when I was 14, just looking for any way to earn online. I tried CPA, affiliate marketing, freelancing you name it. None of it clicked for me. The only things that brought in a little cash were surveys and game offers, and even then, the pay wasn’t great.\n\nI’ve been jumping from one thing to another, just hoping to find something that actually works for me. I really don’t have the time or energy to throw into something that eats up my whole day. Things are rough, I can barely afford food or basics. No matter how hard I try, I keep hitting dead ends.\n\nI even decided to focus on something I actually care about, just to see if it felt better. So, I built a Chrome extension that helps people where their researches. A few people used it, it even got featured , but honestly, it didn’t go anywhere. I’m not expecting to blow up with thousands of users, but it’s tough not to feel like I wasted all that time. It took me 4-5 months to finish that extension while seeking help on Discord Servers.\n\nI feel like a failure sometimes, especially when I look at how much time I’ve put in for almost nothing. I can’t even cover my basic needs, and finding a job feels impossible and I've applied to over a hundred jobs and nothing’s landed. I’m not asking to get rich, just want to be able to handle my own stuff without stressing about every little thing.\n\nI’m actually pretty good at computer repairs, so I tried offering my services on platforms like Fiverr, but my gig barely got any attention. Then I switched to cryp-to, and wow, so many scammers out there just trying to take your money with zero intention of helping. Funny enough, the only thing that made me any real money was gambling. I made about a hundred bucks, but I had to quit before it I become addicted. Seriously, don’t mess with gambling, so it’s not worth it.\n\nSome nights I can’t even sleep because my mind just keeps running in circles about all this stuff. I’m burned out, anxious, and it feels like I’m never going to hit my goal.\n\nI can accept failures, but I just need to find something sustainable that I can visualize it in a way that will be guaranteed.\n\nSorry for the long rant. I know it’s not your problem, and maybe it’s annoying to read, but I just needed to say it. I’m 18, by the way.",

If it's not working, change strategies, not businesses. You have to be willing to put in 80hr weeks, especially when things get hard, so find joy in what you do.\nI've \"tried\" 7 or 8 businesses over the years.

It may just be the angle, or they haven't built trust in you yet. \n\nYou built an amazing Chrome extension. That is a great thing. The problem is that you poured all your time and energy into something  there is no demand for.\n\nFor now, I would suggest finding a job, any job, even if it's menial labour, so that you can pay your bills. This will give you time to work online without jumping around so you can get clear on what suits you best.\n\nDo what you enjoy because it will drain the life out of you if you don't,  and it will help you stay excited and motivated. \n\nYou mentioned computer repairs.

Start a YouTube channel showing people how to do that, or offer it at home as a service to your community, or both. \n\nBased on what you've shared, you probably have ADHD, which means you're thinking 10 steps ahead.

Think like a contrarian and get creative (also a good skillset of an entrepreneur).\n\nQ: If 40K people are applying through the same job posting, how can you differentiate yourself? \n\nA: By not playing the same game everyone else is playing.\n\nInstead find a way to get into direct contact with the decision maker of the hiring (usually hiring manager) and demonstrate your value, how you can solve their problems (making widgets, selling widgets or increasing performance of the former or latter). \n\nThis can be sending a cold email to the person introducing yourself and providing some value which requires diligence, research and work [3].\n\ne.g., \nHi Hiring Manager XYZ,\n\nI noticed you're hiring for position Account Executive, based on some analysis of your competitor ABC's products, I think DEF has the superior QRT because H, J, and K reasons.\n\nI was curious so I did some poking around and had some ideas of potential prospects that might generate some deals moving forward:\n\n1. Name at Company A - Title\n2. Name at Company B - Title\n3. Name at Company C - Title\n\nI think #3 has decision making authority and Company C has recently raised its Series B round and is in need of &lt;DEF product&gt;.\n\nAny interest in getting on a call to discuss?\n\nMy cell: ...; or feel free to send me a Calendly link.\n\nI'm not an expert but maybe that gives some food for thought.\n\n---\n\n[1] The problem with your approach thus far, at least as I read it, is your taking the \"spread fire shot approach\" - this can work if it's in your free time, but if you're burning real cash -- you have to focus on the *problems* you want to solve for other people instead of random widgets and gadgets. Businesses exist to help people solve their problems (See \"Jobs to Be Done Theory\") - most of the time at your age, you just don't have enough real world experience to know what a mid-level manager at a technology company (who is your product's prospect) needs and struggles with, instead you spin your wheels building B2C products (really hard). \n[2] Robert Kiyosaki's path to becoming a business owner and investor was this way too. \n[3] Sales today is not the same as 20 years ago, it's not the sleazy car salesman instead it's taking the role of a trusted advisor - see Dale Carnegie's Sell!",

Since you already built a Chrome extension and have tech skills, have you considered creating simple quiz funnels for local businesses? They're surprisingly effective for lead generation and you could charge $300-500 per quiz setup.\n\nYour computer repair skills could actually be your foot in the door - offer to help local businesses with their tech issues, then mention how a \"Which service do you need?\" quiz on their website could help them get more qualified leads.

If you like computer repairs, perhaps getting into an electrician trade school might be a good option? \nTLDR: I have the same head as you where I lose sleep at times overthinking everything I could be doing to make more money. I was dead broke (in CC debt) working in restaurants until about 24/25, then Covid hit and I applied to every job possible and ended up in finance (finance/econ major in college). I now make 6 figures, married, own a home, but still ask a lot of what if’s. I was always creative and think I would have killed it if I just followed my creative passions, but alcohol in the restaurant industry got in the way and I pursued booze, herb, and women. Thankfully I’m doing well now, but like I said, I still look back and forward, constantly thinking what more I can do with my skills and interests. \nCurrently exploring no-code app building but it does require $ investments.. the less technical you are the more expensive it is too, and I am not very technical and don’t have time to learn that shit with a full time job, a wife, home and a kid on the way. So here I am. \nAnyway, if you ever wanna talk ideas, strategy, etc, from someone who has failed and picked themselves back up but still yearns for more, let me know. Best of luck!",

This is the problem I've seen time and time again, Honestly it's very similar to people wanting \"romantic love\". **We often idealize what finding the right person is, or finding the right business or venture**. The reality is that every venture or \"vehicle\" can work, why? Because right now there's someone pursuing that venture and succeeding. You've mentioned many ventures you pursued, and I imagine you've gone to a point where you've hit the wall of frustration, or the valley of despair, Where you realize said venture isn't what it was cracked up to be. the funny thing is every single venture has bottlenecks, trade offs, And limitations you need to solve for. (But every time you jump ship, you're starting over!) Knowing all I know about psychology and reward systems, I think what you really want is \"A venture that yields a reward fast enough To make me feel Like **I've got it, this is the one**\" and if you get a small win early on, Then that often pushes you to want to keep pursuing said task, goal or venture. This is why it's so helpful to account for your skill set. And pick a venture that has the most crossover to utilize said skill set, **so you're not starting over from zero**! Trust me brother I know it's a struggle, **BUT** it become significantly less of a struggle, when you pick a path/ venture, Burn the boats, And commit to sinking four to five years of your life into it. At the end of that road you'll at the very least have a monstrous skill set to show for it. And in turn you just keep **getting better**! and if you just keep getting better, eventually \"better\" will yield something. Good luck my friend!",

Met a mentor on TikTok joined his discord met people just like me hungry to make it out , some bs happened with the mentor that me and some of the students in there decided to leave and make our own free discord and brought some people with us, we all been in this journey now for a year , one of the homies now he’s 24 just like me closed a $30k trade off gold that took him like 1 hr to make another friend of ours , she’s a mom lol , but her dedication to learn this is as much as all of us last week aswell she made $12k off a trade aswell , including myself , after a year of locking back in I finally broke the cycle and everything clicked I took my first ever payout of $1,800 off a prop firm called topstep , my birthday is in may and I’m on a mission to have $25k in Cash by then , I tell you this bc I can tell your hungry for more and if you are up for the late night , studying , starring at candle sticks , learn to trade , yes 90% of people fail but that’s bc they don’t have fully control of there emotion / psychology, and that’s #1 before you see any results \n\nIf you up for the challenge and want it as bad as you want to breathe here’s a good start , on YT search up “tjr bootcamp” \n\nYou may see that people talk sh*t about this guy but he’s 23 with a freaking koenigsegg AT23!!! If your bashing on him that just speaks about yourself and your mindset bc some people just hate on him while others like me see it as motivation to get out of this rat race, \n\nAnyways , his boot camps videos are beginner friendly and i recommend him to almost anyone who has no clue about trading. \nIt’s not impossible, you just got to want it as bad as you want to breathe , Goodluck if you do decide to take this path , don’t tell anyone not even your parents or closest friend that you want to trade bc off the rip they’ll tell you “ it’s gambling” but as a someone who’s spent every dollar on this combines accounts to pass and get funded  so I can actually make money and finally seeing my growth , I’m telling you F**k what anyone else thinks, you’re young rn your able to take more risk compared to a 30 year old \n\nI tell you this bc in our homie discord we got people that are 19 , 20 , 21 all of us starting to print money and we can see the change happening in front of our eyes , but I promise you this , every single person making money in trading has gone thru hell learning this skill set IT IS NOT EASY BUT IT SURELY ISNT IMPOSSIBLE",

This is not a promotional comment, rather I am a builder trying to validate a genuine idea that I believe could help some of the founders out there. I am building an AI tool, basically an AI accountability partner. The most failure stories of founders and builders that I have heard about is getting initial validation and then the product failing in the market. So I thought of building an anti-empathetic AI tool that will ask critical questions at your decisions and reminds you brutally about the goals you set and how much you achieve. I am thinking of using multi AI agents orchestrations to swarm a group of personal advisory AI agents to do the work and this might cost a bit more than usual chatbots like AI, so I have to validate this idea and I think this is the best place to make that validation.\n\nSo founders, what do you think?",

However, a series of apps to address things have been integrated in the prior two.  The trouble with initial technology innovation is the average employee now works with 10 apps, never mind moving between them.\n\nNow, I suggest a primary stack with a lot things apps integrated usually described as a revenue operating system (RevOps). That said get a RevOps with a human centric AI to automate so many things in different roles.  For example, today's average salesperson spends 30% of their time selling.  The other things they do are not productive, revenue generating, and really not their job.  So align an AI to a sales person to handle meeting notes, if on the road record what happened during the trip, produce account and monthly sales reports, and more. The sales roles is one example, the same premise can be used for many other roles.  So instead laying off everybody, optimize your #1 asset or people with AI enable RevOps (reducing 10 apps a day to one central stack).",

      "selftext": "What's up everyone\n\nSo I've been lurking here forever seeing all these \"how do I monetize AI\" posts and I finally have something that's actually working. Not some get-rich-quick thing but like... actual recurring revenue.\n\nBasically I built a voice bot that answers phones for dental offices using ElevenLabs and n8n. Sounds boring but hear me out.\n\nThe whole idea came from my dentist's office constantly missing calls when they're busy. I was like... why isn't this automated yet? So I just built it.\n\nWhat it does\n\nAnswers calls 24/7, books appointments, answers the basic stuff like office hours and insurance questions, and passes the complicated calls to real people. That's it. Nothing fancy.\n\nStack is super simple - ElevenLabs API for the voice (seriously their voices are insanely good now), n8n to connect everything together, and it hooks into their calendar system.\n\nWhat actually worked\n\nStarted with literally one clinic. Didn't even charge them much at first, just wanted to see if it actually worked in the real world. Spent like a full day just sitting at their front desk watching what they do.\n\nThe voice thing is weirdly important. My first version sounded like a corporate robot and people hated it. Made it sound more friendly and casual and suddenly everyone was fine with it.\n\nYou HAVE to let people bail to a human. I added a \"press 0 anytime\" thing and it made all the difference. Some people just aren't gonna talk to a bot and that's cool.\n\nHonestly the biggest lesson was don't try to make it do everything. It handles the boring repetitive calls and that's enough. The staff handles the rest.\n\nWhere I'm at now\n\nStarted in August with that one clinic, now I've got 4. Charging like $500-800 to set it up then $200-400 a month depending on call volume. Making around $1400/month right now which isn't crazy but it's growing.\n\nBest moment was when one of the office managers told me her team can actually eat lunch now without stressing about phones. Made the whole thing feel worth it honestly.\n\nNot gonna lie my first launch was a disaster lmao. It double booked a bunch of appointments because I messed up the calendar integration. But you figure it out.\n\nIf you wanna try this\n\nJust find one local business with a phone problem. Dentists, hair salons, lawyers, whatever. Build something simple that solves ONE annoying thing they deal with every day.\n\nDon't overthink it. My whole setup runs on like $50/month in costs and took me maybe 2 weeks to build the first version.\n\nAnyway hope this helps someone. Happy to answer stuff if you have questions\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all nice comments and ton of upvotes i really appreciate it.",

Often I find small businesses focussing on broad keywords like \"best company in United States\" etc rather than targeting locally like \"best dentist in Naperville Illinois\"! It's much easier to be the top result if you are super focused on your target market. These days you can easily use AI tools like Frizerly or Pulse to actually generate the strategy and blogs to post regularly if you define your target customer and solution carefully. Once you do this, check your analytics regularly, and then find the top performing blogs and double down on it manually by doing a human review/edit.",

          "body": "Best marketing advice I got was \"distribution beats product every time.\" You can have the best product in the world but if nobody sees it, you're dead.\n\nOur clients obsess over perfecting their product features while completely ignoring how they're actually gonna reach customers. They spend months building cool shit that nobody ever finds out about because their marketing is an afterthought.\n\nYour copy advice is solid too. Trying to appeal to everyone means you're generic as hell and nobody connects with it. Pick a specific person with a specific problem and talk directly to them.\n\nThe other big one is most businesses discover their marketing isn't working way too late. They run campaigns for months assuming people are seeing their stuff, then find out their emails were landing in spam the whole time or their ads were targeting the wrong audience. By the time they figure it out, they've burned through their budget.\n\nMarketing isn't just about having good copy or a clear target audience, it's about making damn sure your message actually reaches people. Doesn't matter how perfect your targeting is if your emails go to spam or your ads never get approved.\n\nFocus on distribution first, product second. Build something decent, get it in front of people, learn what they actually want, then improve. Don't hide in your garage perfecting features nobody asked for.",

It’s a goood start, but the real goal is to keep building a team and getting those longer-term projects. Small one-off gigs are fine for now, but you need to start thinking about bigger wins. \n\nOne thing though. most firms making claims like this will hit a wall when they try to scale up. Ask for references at your exact stage. don’t get sucked into placement numbers. \n\nIt’s cool youre sharing this. Just keep it focused on the core. building a solid team and landing those bigger contracts. keep pushing!",

Most people only see the highlights, not the isolation or self-doubt.\n\nI’m curious:(being a SaaS Founder myself)\n\n* What’s one unfiltered reality you wish you’d known before starting?\n* How do you handle the emotional rollercoaster during the silent phases... when there’s no traction yet and momentum feels slow?\n* Any routines, mindsets, or support systems that keep you grounded through the ups and downs?\n\nLet’s swap real stories and support, especially for newer founders who need to hear that the gritty parts are normal, and often the most important.",

Once your mindset and reality shifts from \"get a job, get paid by a fixed wage, please boss, try to get a promotion, spend money to live a balanced life outside your work\" to \"see what others can't see, invest, sell, hire, acquire profit or pay for losses\", you'll become different from most people and won't be able to bond over much.\n\n  \n(b) I don't know about you, but I was severely impacted by the emotional and financial roller coaster of my businesses. At a certain point, I made several mistakes and went bankrupt. I had to juggle unpaid bills, creditors and family responsibilities. There is no crash course about emotional intelligence that is going to prepare you for that. You can't share that situation with most people, they will absolutely freak out. You also can't share the best news with a lot of people. Telling someone that you had an amazing year and your company made millions is going to get an employee relative / friend bitter very fast.\n\n  \n(c) My support system consists of three high school friends that are entrepreneurs.

Just make sure love the journey and document it, and when you feel like you are not going anywhere look at those documents, and you will understand how far you came from an idea to a real existing thing. These things that i am saying feels like motivation but i think that it is psychological thing, kind of build a mindset of keep going. \n\nI will say take it as a war or like a game, if you heard of dark souls, follow that mindset. \n\nI am still on this journey, and i am with you, and i also face the same things everyday ,that you mentioned.

          "body": "Agree with everything OP says. In addition, the hardest truth I learnt is that the feeling of not being good enough never really goes away. You always learn more every day, realise you didn't think of something and have to learn yet another thing from scratch. You start questioning whether you really know anything at all. That feeling paralyses you from doing the learning, being productive and you end up procrastinating because you're overwhelmed. It's important to accept that this feeling won't end.\n\nThe other hard truth I learnt is that without your health, there is no business. I used to be really proud of my lifestyle. Woke up at 5, went to the gym, and ate well and was in incredible shape and was very organised, disciplined, and productive. After being a founder, I feel like I've lost control of everything. I felt guilty for spending time looking after myself and resting. I felt like I should always be working and stopped going gym, ate whatever, slept at random times and tried to work continuously. I've slowly and finally accepted that you need to take days off to rest, eat, and sleep properly. Otherwise, you will burn out fast, and end up being unproductive and inconsistent.\n\nHandling the emotional roller coaster is a beast, but what helped me is talking to other founders and someone who can hold you accountable. I started telling some of the people I see at the gym that I will be there on this day. They're expecting me so I turn up. Same with anything you have been procrastinating on, set a deadline and get someone to hold you accountable. It does work for the short term when you are struggling, and you get stuff done so you don't look stupid. Eventually, you gain control of it yourself and form the discipline necessary. \n\nI've also found that not getting excited regardless of what is happening, whether that is good or bad, keeps me in a balanced emotional state to make sound business decisions. I hope you are doing okay, and it will pay off. Believe in yourself and your dreams.",

When I am heading to the meeting I usually know what I am responsible for and what is important. I usually use the title and description of the meeting on teams to prepare and write a short punch list of what I need from it and what I need to execute. Then if the meeting goes past the allotted time I excuse myself saying \"I think I have what I need from this meeting can I be excused? I really have some important objectives to achieve in the next hour.\" I usually do not get pushback from setting boundaries. Meetings usually have a set time allotment and I try not to go past that time period. If it is completely off track I write down important questions for that department before I leave and send a clarification email after leaving. The whole point of meetings is to relay information. If the person who is in charge does not relay information in an efficient manner it is not your fault and your work is just as important as everyone else's. So set meeting boundaries and make sure you get what you need while you are there. Never leave before the time allotment and only engage in longer than anticipated meetings if your superior or his superior is present. Excuse yourself in any meeting you can as soon as the time has run over. If you can delegate tasks to AI or someone competent and close and have them send you detailed notes to review at your convenience. Your time is money 🤑 the less you have the freedom to use it the lower your income.

It sounds like you've hit a tipping point.\n\nA great signal that it's time to hire (or in your case, invest in a tool) is when you realize you've become the bottleneck. If you're spending all your time on administrative tasks instead of steering the ship, it's impossible to move forward. \n\nThe real cost to consider here is **opportunity cost**: what is the cost of *you* doing this work instead of focusing on your core business? How much is your time worth, and could it be better spent on sales or strategy instead of playing catch-up on notes? \n\nThe big question to ask is: **how much time are you currently wasting on workarounds?** Your scattered notes are a workaround. When you realize the cost of your time trying to fix these issues (and the risk of forgetting a commitment) is more than the cost of a new tool, it's time to upgrade.\n\nBefore you look at any new tool, it helps to identify the specific problem you're trying to solve. It sounds like you don't need a massive, complex system; you need one that's great at tracking who said what and what was agreed upon. You shouldn't upgrade just to grow -- you should upgrade bc your current system is actively preventing growth. I hope this helps -- pls feel free to reach out if you have any questions!",

Six months in and it's the opposite.\n\nIts funny, nearly every post I make on this Subreddit says this, but no one listens. Entrepreneurship isn't taking control, it is giving up more of it, especially when you're first getting started.\n\nYou cease answering to a boss and begin answering to staff, contractors, investors, clients, tax men, bankers, vendors, and more.\n\nHaving a single person to answer to is a luxury people fail to see until they're drowning.\n\n&gt;7 hours of meetings yesterday. Then spent hours trying to remember what was decided in each one. \\[...\\] The worst part? Keeping track of it all. Who said what, when things are due, which client needs what follow-up. I'm constantly scrambling through scattered notes trying to piece together what was actually agreed upon.\n\nProject managers, especially those who are experts in specialized methods like Scrum or Canban, etc, are paid a lot of money to teach teams systems of managing projects. Bosses are project managers. You need to learn how to manage your tasks, commitments, and duties and prioritize, triage, and complete them.\n\nDo you know 4 out of 5 small businesses fail in 5 years? Because their owners think they can fire a boss and do the same thing with less stress. Nope, you now are the boss, and everything you took for granted at the place you once worked is now on you... project management, sales, bookkeeping, hr, and more.\n\nYou can fix this. See below.\n\n&gt;Everything is \"urgent\" and \"quick 15-minute chats\" turn into hour-long requirement sessions.\n\nWelcome to an important thing called: setting boundaries. Plan 30 or 60 minute chats, and keep you and your fellow meeting person on task. If someone says \"I have a 15-minute quick question\", and it isn't, talk to them about ways they can better prepare themselves and you so you do not overrun the schedule. Require follow-ups if you can't finish, but also, teach the people you work with that your time is valuable and brevity and directness is mandatory and respectful.\n\n&gt;I'm drowning in administrative overhead and playing catch-up on commitments I made in meetings I can barely remember.\n\nThis isn't a symptom of too many meetings, this is a symptom of a lack of a lack of organization and lack of knowledge how to get organized. Not to be harsh, but this is a you problem not an entrepreneurship problem. That said, welcome to the biz.\n\nYou can learn what you need to know.\n\nTake notes. Create to-do items from meetings. Use productivity tools to keep track of items. Use Canban or Scrum methods to track items. Task management apps can be formatted toward those techniques. Create summaries you can easily access every start of work day. \n\nIf you can't keep track of choices you and your team make, you're not ready to do this thing you're doing.\n\nPerhaps put a one-week pause on new meetings and focus on learning a system to stay organized.",

When you are clear on the problem and the pain point because you have done the deep work to understand the problem:  \nMove deliberately and build with intention.

Survivorship bias: we all hear about the beauty of building a startup, but we only hear from those who have succeeded. We very rarely, if ever, hear from the hundreds who have failed. That said, if you were to believe that 95% of startups fail, that means for every successful entrepreneur we hear from, there are 19 others who never got to share their story and have faded into obscurity.\n\n2. The bias of overconfidence. Think of this like the dunning kruger effect: the less you know about something, the more confident you feel about it. Entrepreneurship is no different in this respect. When we choose this life, very few of us are fully aware of what we are signing up for.\n\n3. The planning fallacy, which Daniel Kahneman talks about beautifully. Basically, whenever we make plans, most of us have a horrible habit of being overly optimistic and systematically underestimating the time, costs, and risks of future actions while overestimating the benefits. \n\nAll that being said, I can also say that if you stick with it, entrepreneurship can be one of the most rewarding things you can do with your time, and I can not imagine myself doing anything else.",

      "selftext": "Hey all , i wanted to share my recent experience and get some advices. So i am an software engineer, currently working as a lead at an edtech startup. On the side , i was recently working with a founder on a saas for publishers , i had connected with her on YCombinator cofounder site . So we never had things on contract, but rather like it was discussed that we will work and figure out things for an exploratory period like 3 months , and then see how it pans out.   \n  \nWe ended up creating a MVP much recently. And I started gathering feedback for the same, me being the person who is working on product and tech side. So i outreached people on reddit and outreached publishers through google. And i ended up  outreaching a publisher who herself had created a software around accounting for publishers.   \n  \nSo she mailed us to figure out collaboration since she was focusing more on core publishing and thought that our  company could take better care of the product . So i shared that mail with my founder and i was happy at that time. I thought B2B partnership might be very beneficial. And i suggested her , maybe not collaboration but maybe we can have this person as advisor. To have a conversation to figure how can this pan out. \n\nSo she mentioned to wait before responding, and I went back to resolving a bug or something. An hour later, my access to github is gone, vercel is gone and i get an email that i am fired effective immediately. And i was just shocked and didn't know how to react to this. She just mentioned that she is firing me , and no call or anything. Apparently on her end she started thinking that i have been collaborating and sharing code to other companies or this publisher . And i tried to explain her that this is a misunderstanding and if she would have reached out that publisher. She would have understood the same. Naturally i am not ever working there.   \n  \nI am very sad, for starters. And I thought that the core agreements could have been done later, however the important thing was validation of the product. And i worked on this as my own product , and i believed it the same as well. But the fact that i just got fired over an email without any conversation made me realised how little my founder would have thought possibly just a freelancer. \n\nSo i wanted to understand what things did i do wrong ? Should everything be on paper. Should i keep my holding company moving forward ??   \nAnd what should i do for the next thing or partnership , since i can't really do everything on my own. ",

For this situation, look at the contract signed &amp; esp the termination clause. Can she terminate effective immediately? That would be unusual. What happens if she breaches the contract, which she has done if she didn't follow the termination clause, &amp; esp does that affect the IP transfer in your deliverables - the essential question is does the IP transfer if she breaches the contract. It shouldn't &amp; would need some orecise language to all breach not affecting the IP transfer. Get a US lawyer to give a quote to review - I'd say an hour or two is all someone decent needs for a review &amp; either email advice or verbal advice.

We’re down to 15 people now, and it’s hard to even take half our salaries after paying the team.\n\nI’ve got bills piling up, and I’m honestly torn. Should I move on and find a job for stability, or keep pushing the company and hope things turn around?\n\nIf you’ve been through something similar, how did you decide when it was time to step away?",

Sounds great until you factor in our 8% net margin - that's about $224K profit before fees.\n\nBreakdown of what we paid:  \n\\- Card transaction fees: roughly $47K  \n\\- ACH transaction fees: roughly $23K  \n\\- Total: $70K gone\n\nThat's 31% of our profit taken. Nearly a third. On a good year.\n\nAnyone else feeling this pain? What has everyone here been using to actually get paid?\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who has responded! Was trying to keep up with everyone but had to log off and now there's way too many to get back to everyone individually.\n\nBeen getting a lot of advice and messages about needing to switch/helping me switch processors. Just want to clarify that I already have switched and haven't paid a dime in processing fees over the past few weeks. Free service, $0 ACH fee, passes card fees automatically, and free instant settlement + can pay my subs.

And subsequently many of their kids follow this path.  \n\nThe other side of the coin are multi-millionaires with loads of confirmation bias about their abilities due to years of selling annuities to rubes or sitting on a boring family business like an established CPA practice.  They set their kids or wife up with a passion project in a high dollar corporate lease and all the sudden they owe $8k a month for 6 years on a personal guarantee.  Their nepos burn out in 9 months and go back to just existing or maybe limp along for a handful of years. Sometimes this consumes the legacy business as well and tanks the whole family.  Either way it ends up with the usual business for sale listing quoting 4 years of best case scenario revenue as a lump sum pay out. That sits for a year before they offer the place up for raw parts and assumption of the lease.  \n\nSource: former broke ass restaurant worker, former broke ass restaurant owner, former consultant, and current financial advisor.

She had 12 people confirmed and asked if she could just pay me the time of the tour if more friends decided to join. It turned out to be 18, but then several dropped out after a few minutes. It was chaotic because they were chatty and I had to herd them and look out for stragglers. I wasn't used to such a large group. I had 16 complete the tour. The whole day had been stressful so I was distracted and forgot to make sure the first person paid me for the extra 4 people before ending the tour last night. Today I'm texting her for the extra tickets and so far she's not answering. Hoping she will eventually, but what can I do if she doesn't? That's $140. May not seem like much, but I'm just one person and that can pay some bills. ",

That number is a bit lower than what you are able to entertain. Now you are realizing that 16 people is a lot. Moving forward, do not go over the usual 12 people, but if a group asks in advance “hey is there any way it could be 14 or 15?” your answer is yes, but you require payment for them 48 hours in advance, otherwise they will be asked to leave at the time of the tour. They should know this, because now it’s in a contract that they sign. \n\nNow let’s say that someone *doesn’t ask* because of course, that’s going to happen. Either the extra participants are not allowed to participate, or, they have to pay a $10 convenience/last minute fee on top of the ticket fee. The booker shouldn’t gawk at this, because they will have signed a contract upon payment that says “I understand that any added participants must be agreed upon with the tour guide and paid in full at least 48 hours in advance of the tour. Failure to communicate and pay for them in advance will result in those participants to be turned away from the tour unless the extra participants pay for their ticket plus a $10 convenience fee before the tour starts.” \n\n\nIf you don’t have a contract that they sign, get one. I believe that you have some legal precedent to have her pay if you both agreed in writing, but to be honest, I would just cut the loss if she never responds and use this money to make a contract if you don’t have one that includes contingencies and policies like this.",

Afterwards, your power is greatly diminished and you might be stuck with going legal....which will then rapidly teach you a lesson or two about contracts!\n\nHopefully this person is just being lax and will end up paying you - keep chasing for a while. If not, then don't beat yourself up, just don't let it happen again. A simple way would have been to flip it on the head and say you'd take payment for 10 extra people and simply refund based on the amount of people who actually turned up, or just make sure you took payment at the start.\n\nIt's easier to refund than it is to chase down money after the fact, for sure!",

      "selftext": "EDIT / i was not expecting this to blow up so much, but please know me and my partner spent the entire day today repositioning ourselves in preparation for our meeting with the client. i am meeting with him tomorrow morning and will post an update … thank you all so so much 😭 forcing me to think bigger, and face my self deeply \n\n\n\n\nMy business partner and I run a social media content  agency (2 years old, 17 active clients). One of our founding clients has approached us about going exclusive - they want us to dissolve our agency and work only for them as their dedicated in-house marketing team.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- 17 clients generating solid revenue ($48K per month) \n\n- 9-person team (2 partners + 7 staff)\n\n- Client proposing exclusive deal has been with us since Year 1 (currently paying $9500/mo) \n\n- They've grown significantly with us (but only getting ~15-20% of our bandwidth currently)\n\n- They're our largest single client but represent &lt;20% of our revenue \n\n**The Proposal:**\n- 12-month exclusive contract\n- We'd reduce from 9 to 4 people (me, business partner, 2 key team members)\n- Compensation: Base monthly retainer + 10% commission on their course/digital product sales\n- Scope: Personal brand, company brand, course business, potential support for spouse's brand\n- We'd be walking away from 80%+ of our current revenue to take this\n\n**The Numbers Being Discussed:**\n- $379K for the 4 person team ($144k yearly salary  for me and my partner each) \n- Commission could add $10-50K+ if we scale their course business\n- This would roughly match our current personal income but with commission upside (currently making $7k a month + building cash reserve for agency) \n- We'd go from managing 17 clients to 100% focus on one brand ecosystem\n\n**What We're Torn On:**\n\nPros:\n- Simplified operations (1 client vs 17)\n- Higher personal income potential with commission structure\n- Deep partnership with someone we've proven success with\n- 12-month contract = stability\n- Elimination of constant sales/client management\n- Can build elite expertise in one vertical\n\n**Cons:**\n- 100% concentration risk\n- Walking away from $460K+ annual revenue from other clients\n- Pausing agency growth trajectory (we could hit $1M+ in 3-5 years)\n- If it fails, we rebuild from zero\n- Letting go of 5 team members\n- No diversification\n\n**Questions for You:**\n\n1. **Has anyone made a similar pivot?** How did it turn out?\n\n2. **Is $30-32K/month + 10% commission fair** for dissolving a multi-client agency and going exclusive? Or are we undervaluing ourselves?\n\n3. **Red flags we should watch for?** Client has been great for 2 years, but exclusive relationships can change dynamics.\n\n4. **Contract terms we absolutely need?** We're thinking 12-month minimum, quarterly advance payments, 90-day notice. What are we missing?\n\n5. **How do you value opportunity cost?** Is the simplified life worth the concentration risk?\n\n6. **Anyone regret going exclusive?** What would you do differently?\n\n**Additional Context:**\n- Client is ready to scale (proven product-market fit with their course)\n- They have budget and seem committed\n- We'd still own our systems/processes\n- Could theoretically rebuild agency if this ends\n\n**The Real Question:**\nAre we crazy for even considering this? Or is this the kind of focused partnership that could be more valuable than spreading ourselves thin across 17 clients?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who's faced a similar decision - especially if you've been on either side of an exclusive arrangement.\n\n**Edit:** To clarify - we're not desperate or struggling. Agency is healthy and growing. This is purely a strategic decision about depth vs. breadth.",

But you could find yourself unemployed after those 12 months once your client better understands exactly what it is you do and how he can outsource it, fire you, and cut his expenses. The security is an illusion. You go from being an independent business owner to an employee so you lose your freedom and mobility. No doubt the contract will protect him more than it protects you. And the final nail in the coffin is that you lose your ability to truly scale. \n\nInstead, counter him. Tell him you will provide an exclusive team that will operate under contract with his business and they will have no other accounts. That team of 4 will be under a noncompete with you for 5-10 years so none of them get the same offer you got and strike out on their own with this client as their first. You will also still take the retainer to lead this team independently of the remainder of your business, and the salary should be paid to your company to then be distributed to the employees based on their contract with you.\n\nDon’t destroy what you built for the illusion of safety and predictability. There are no guarantees in business. At least with you steering the ship, if you crash among the rocks you know who to blame instead of wearing a blindfold and wondering why the boat suddenly stopped.",

The biggest issue is you are giving up a stable situation with a lot of long-term upside for a position that only has a short-term guarantee and that introduces a lot of risk.  \n\nI would encourage you to consider the exclusive deal as something more like an acquisition.  If they were buying your company, they would have to pay you the value of the current business, and/or in some combination give you a job at a guaranteed rate for some length of time, plus some earn-out and/or success-based compensation.  This is something like what they are proposing, except the guarantee isn't very long, and even if you max out the commission, it doesn't seem like they are paying you enough to throw away the rest of your business.  They would also have to be paying you enough to walk away from the future growth of that business -- just as in an acquisition, except you might not be looking to sell if you still have a lot of value-maximization to do in growing the company.  It's hard to imagine them ever wanting to pay enough for a 1-year deal with you to balance all that out, but if you want to exit to them and can get them to pay for the terminal value of the business, maybe it's a conversation.\n\nIt's also unclear what is motivating them to do this.  Are they not getting enough resources from you?  Get a larger guarantee from them and scale up the team serving them.  Give them some kind of preferred rate and priority SLA in exchange for it, and make sure X% of your personal time is focused on that business.

Make sure the contract has a no solicitation clause for your top talent who will work the account and that your margins are set at a high enough level (higher than now) to compensate you for the loss of these team members on your other accounts. After all, you are incurring an opportunity cost by taking them out of service to others. Also consider emphasizing to the client that they do currently benefit from the fact that you are actively working in the same and perhaps other industries that will keep your content cutting edge sharp. If they insist on bringing it in house and they are a big enough growth partner, offer to help them set it up, find a few employees and provide 100 percent cooperation with their internal team.  Then, stay involved in the account growth… the new internal team does the simple stuff to save them some $ and give them the speed to market or whatever controls they are craving and you do the amazing, impactful, big idea work. Set up a mutual progress meeting quarterly. If they want exclusivity within their specific industry, no problem, but that costs more (unless this is not an issue for you) Good luck and remember, being your own bosses is why you are here!!

It was the most fun but least profitable and hardest to maintain business model we encountered. Cheers -",

If not offer a compromise that you will build a small team internally exclusively focused their account. Honestly doing this you would be more flexible if something was to happen to the exclusive partner. Another compromise is they buy the whole agency but keep it as a separate business. This creates a secondary revenue stream for him. It also keeps your current team together.",

He looked decent on paper so I gave him and chance and hired him as a contractor him for a one off project. Today was his first day and was 40 mins late. WTF!!\n\nI hate to be someones dad or lecture him like a school principal but arriving late on the first day of ANYTHING is a terrible first impression. School, job, meeting, even first date just starts the entire experience on a bad note.\n\nI'm thinking about just cutting him loose after today. It might be a bit harsh but just showing up the first day 40 mins late after begging me for a shot gives me a gut feeling he's going to be a bigger headache than a diamond in the rough.\n\nHas anyone had a similar experience or got burned hiring an unproven person, family member, or person with a sob story?",

She would say she did work but never show it, lie all the time, etc. K ended up getting fired.\n\nMy friend wasn’t mad at me and I’ve referred her people that she’s hired full time and are part of her core team now, but I think both of us learned that if someone starts showing red flags, just cut em loose. Be quick to hire and quick to fire. Don’t drag it out if you know they’re going to suck.\n\nBased on the details you gave that personally wouldn’t be enough for me to make that decision without clearing things up. Are you sure he knew the correct time? Did he communicate he was going to be late? What did he say when you pointed it out? There are some details here that I think are pertinent.\n\nBut if he knew the time, didn’t apologize, didn’t communicate, and didn’t care about his fuck up, yes cut him loose. Not worth the headache.",

      "selftext": "I run a boat rental business and recently partnered with an insurance company to offer optional rental insurance. I made it optional because I did not want to force customers to buy it, even though it costs me a lot to provide the option. I already carry liability insurance, but if a customer damages the boat, they are responsible for those costs. The rental insurance offers several affordable plans to give customers extra peace of mind.\n\nAfter this customer made his reservation, I called him to review the meeting location and details, which are also included in the confirmation email. I like to do this personally to make sure everything is clear and to answer any questions.\n\nI also explained that he would receive a second email where he would need to sign the waiver and other documents. After that, the rental insurance page would appear, clearly marked as optional, and he could choose to decline it.\n\nHe became irritated and said I was not being transparent and that he did not appreciate it. I explained that the insurance is completely optional and that we only offer it because other customers have requested it. It is even mentioned at the beginning of the confirmation email.\n\nHe told me I had ruined his fun and said he felt obligated to buy insurance. I repeated that he did not have to purchase it, but he said, “Well, now I am worried something might happen during my trip,” and then he hung up.\n\nI am honestly confused about how I was not being transparent. If you rent a car or book a flight, they always offer optional insurance. It is the same concept. I just want to make sure my customers feel safe and protected, not pressured.",

And while it's not every customer it's enough to discourage me from going the extra mile in this way.  \n\nThe first e-mail went out as a confirmation, the second email went out which included the optional insurance.  As long as it's clear what is optional and what's required, let the automated system do its thing.  If the customer has a question after receiving the emails, then address it.  But until then, I remain hands off.\n\nAnd I get it, you're trying to provide excellent customer service, but today it's typically best to assume the customer knows/understands unless/until they reach out with questions or needing additional information.\n\nTo be clear, HE'S the problem, not you.",

          "body": "This is the customer's problem for the most part, so no harm done...but if you're noticing a lot of people are dropping off at the insurance page, then you might want to think about testing some alternative routes to booking completion.\n\nNote, I'm not saying you've done anything wrong at all here, just that you could potentially convert those people who are upsell / add-on averse like what happened here to potentially another successful rental.\n\nThe problem is, people see that second page and think \"why are they trying to sell me insurance now? If I needed it, why isn't it included?\" They might even go so far as to start thinking along the lines of \"this is how they get you\" - and a that would be both ends of that scale - \"they sell you insurance you don't need!\" AND \"they'll screw you for any damage at the other end, and tell you that you should have bought the insurance!!\". Obviously neither are true, but people - bloody hell.\n\nInstead of making the insurance optional in an additional step, try showing both options on the same page - still making it super clear one is WITH accidental damage insurance, and one WITHOUT. Maybe add some wording that the expectation is they bring their own insurance or take the risk, on their wallet be it.\n\nMaybe even try just one price - with insurance included as standard - and having the option to REMOVE it, instead of add it. You just need to be careful about how you can advertise your pricing then, so you don't price yourself out of the market against competitors who don't include insurance.\n\nThe reason these kinds of approaches can work? You're making them feel more in control - making their own choices, kind of thing. It's not an upsell when the options are all presented the same page, it's an informed choice.\n\nDo note however that sometimes, the smallest changes can have the biggest impacts, but good AND bad...so whenever you're testing things like this, be ready to be analysing your numbers as close to realtime as you can - have solid baseline figures recorded so you're not just going off 'feel' (though that is also important), and change or revert these changes if they're showing a negative impact.",

However, this customer is most likely just a picky customer. I'd ignore it. I would ideally try to bundle in the insurance into the rental cost and make it required. Making it optional puts all the liability on you. If they do crash your boat and your insurance covers it, YOUR RATE will increase. It's just too stressful. Make it required and bake it into the cost. You can pitch it as it's in their benefit to have it.

      "selftext": "UPDATE:\nI no longer have to worry about the amount of increase coming from UHC by our PEO Insperity. They just notified us they are NOT renewing our group health plan at all! What’s more this includes our Workers Comp Plan (for which I’ve had zero claims for at least 15 years). They said we no longer meet their client “risk tolerance profile”. While I’d love to leave Insperity all together I am now scrambling to find new group health coverage, vision, dental, EPL&amp;I, and Workers Comp. I just don’t know if there is time to change it all. Many suggestions in prior comments are helpful; some aren’t feasible in my particular situation, but all seem to have serious effects on either certain employees, or other issues such as retirement plans, tax issues for both employees and the business, but exploring all the options and figuring this out has now become exponentially more difficult with very little time to do it. I knew they could jack rates into the stratosphere but didn’t know it was possible to get non-renewed!  I’m on it, I’ll figure it out, but normally I wouldn’t have gotten my Insperity renewal contract until after Thanksgiving or early December. Heads up to all small biz owners: do not wait. Reach out proactively in case you are in the same situation as my company. \n\n\nI’m a small business owner of 25 years. I employ 15 people in a professional consultancy business. I’m at a conference today and one owner got his renewal rates for the coming year from Cigna. It’s a 63% increase. He estimates it will cost him $141k more in premiums for his staff this coming year. My company’s increase last year was 17%. I immediately emailed my PEO rep to get me my renewal rates ASAP. I usually get them in late November or early December. We pay the employee portion and employees who want family plans or employee and spouse pay the difference. I’m building my 2026 budget right now. I’m trying to plan raises. I want to increase my 401k match to our staff from 3% to 6%. What are other small business owners seeing in their renewal rates?",

Seeing the cost go up and up and up and up. \n\n\nI only have three people a lot of policy in my insurance went up 16% \n\nBut it goes up pretty much every year and my insurance guy who I think has a pretty good understanding of the industry (and I’m lucky that he takes care of me because there’s not a lot of money in dealing with a small group like mine)\n\n\nHe taught me a lot about healthcare in the role insurance plays in it\n\nNobody cares about the cost of healthcare claims. All they care about is the cost of premium so nobody attributes the cost of claims to what they actually pay. They just would like that cost around differently, which is driven up the costs\n\nThe one thing he taught me that really hit home was Medicare and Medicaid pay much lower reimbursement than typical insurance companies do, and because of the fact they pay reduce rates for claims healthcare providers raise the cost for all of us who aren’t on those programs \n\n\nPeople can blame it on greed or profits but if you go to a university hospital or a nonprofit hospital, you’re paying roughly the same rates as you were at a for-profit hospital \n\n\nBut the bottom line is the fact that cost so much to provide this benefit to our employees… it’s tough\n\nI have a good friend who is executive at a nonprofit and their employees are freaking out because they’re deductible is going up to $1000 rather than 500 … and the employees aren’t paying a penny more for their coverage in premiums a month but the nonprofits gotta pay an additional 11%(keeping the deductible. The same would’ve made it go up something like 19%)\n\nHe told budget to take a look at their financial reports which everyone can look at and ask them where the money is gonna come from… how can they keep the coverage the same without increasing cost to employees?)\n\n\nPeople are legit shocked when they find out that while they pay $100 a month for their individual health insurance that their employers are paying six or 700 \n\nPeople who are fortunate enough to get family coverage and maybe pay for $500 a month think that they’re really getting hosed until they find out their employers are paying 1500 or more on top of the 500 \n\nBut the costs are getting higher and higher because every year the cost of claims goes up and I rarely see people talk about the cost of claims as being something we have to look at\n\nI’m not criticizing you for this you like a lot of people are just frustrated that our cost of doing business or going out, but I don’t think we’re going to see any improvements until people start being honest about what the real challenges has to do with the cost of claims",

My broker said 20%+ and more across the board for small and large groups in my state.\n\nI’m surprised at those who suggesting we jump on the ACA right now. Respectfully, you do know the Fed government is shut down over this issue? I have employees who used that as a great lower cost option in past several years, for their spouse as we pay employee coverage 100%. Now finding out their coverage is not great anymore, as it keeps getting chipped away at, and if subsidies expire they could be paying double soon. Paying out of pocket for spousal coverage on our plan will take a huge chunk of their paycheck. And we pay very competitively in our market.\n\nI do also feel I have a moral obligation to offer my employees excellent healthcare. It’s not right this is our job - I shouldn’t play God &amp; get to decide if you get a PPO or HMO just because you work for me. Once you deep dive on coverage, anything less than a PPO is not worth the money in my opinion. And it’s well known in my area that if you don’t have PPO you’ll have a hard time finding doctors.\n\nClearly folks who think you can get by on catastrophic coverage are young have never had serious or chronic illness. May you forever stay so lucky. I’ve endured stage III cancer, a major accident, and recurring illness and I can rattle on the daily costs of those. It’s not just the immediate cost of care it’s the follow ups, monitoring and specialists. 1 in 3 people will see cancer in their lifetime. And everyone deserves preventative care whether you are 25 or 60. To wait until the worst happens means potentially missing something that could have been caught early, saved the insurance company tens of thousands, saved your employer from losing you in the workforce, and saved you your life.\n\nSorry for the rant, but we should be all very concerned about fixing healthcare. Large business can absorb the increases. But this and other rising costs greatly jeopardize the existence of small business.",

Other than that, I do not know him. \n\nShortly after that interaction, he started advertising that he does \"band instruments rentals\" and offering \"woodwind and brass repair\" - which is what we are focused on. It didn't bother us at all, we do not talk badly of him to anyone. Though many customers have come in and told us some very nasty stories about him - we just say we do not know him and haven't been in his shop. \n\nOver the last year we started getting negative reviews from what appear to be new Google accounts with made up scenarios and stories every other month or so. It is just my husband and I who work here so we really do know every interaction and can back it up with camera footage if need be. \n\nOne review said they took a lesson from us and was treated poorly. At the time of the review, I only had one lesson student, so it was false. After responding to the review that it was fake, the reviewer changed it to, \"called about a repair and no one got back to me\" we checked our voicemail, emails, call log and not a single person had called about repairs that we hadn't replied to. Google will not remove the review. \n\nWe got about 4 more after that and it dropped our 5 star rating to a 4.5, we have gotten a few of them removed, but two won't go away no matter how much reporting. We do reply to all of the reviews and state that what they are saying did not happen and suggest it may have been left for the wrong business. \n\nWe have no proof that it is the other store owner, other than two reviews use the same initials as the guy lol \nEvery single one comes from a google account with 0 other reviews. We have tried to counteract with getting customers to leave 5 star reviews but it still is very frustrating this is happening. \n\nHas anyone dealt with this? Is there anything we can even do other than keep reporting the reviews and encouraging more customers to leave us reviews? Getting people to leave reviews feels like pulling teeth. 😅",

I'm not an attorney but I've filed my share of lawsuits in the past, and actually had an attorney disbarred in Louisiana Supreme Court without representation so I know a little about law. \n\nThe first step-if you are serious about stopping this clear disruption to you and your spouse's ability to operate your business (and you are) - is to begin documenting every instance of interference from the very beginning. \n\nNow before you throw your hands up and say you didn't want to go this far with it, if that's the case you are not that serious about this blatant assault on your livelihood. \n\n 1) You are going to have to retain a lawyer. \n\n 2) You need to bring these documents with you to the \n      lawyer\n\n     Evidence \n\n       a. Screenshots of each review (with timestamps and        \n          \n           platform name(s).\n       \n       b. URLS to the review(s) or reviewer(s) profile(s)\n\n\n       c.

Drop in revenue, customer cancellations, or any   \n\n             negative feedback linked to the reviews.\n\n        b.  Internal records showing disruption (e.g. staff \n\n             complaints, lost contracts).\n\n         c. Any analytics showing traffic or customer decline \n\n             (walk ins).\n\n          \n           d.  Bring witnesses to carroborate the impact or\n\n                threats\n\n           e.

      "selftext": "\nSo back when I was in my sophomore year, I got this idea to start a small clothing brand. I was broke, drowning in assignments &amp; honestly thought it’d be a fun way to make a little money in college\n\nThe idea was to do retro sports-wear, kinda like those 90s oversized tees with old school fonts and colors. I sketched out a few designs, made a logo on Canva *(yeah I know, rookie move)* &amp; thought I was ready to build a brand overnight 😭\n\nAt first I tried finding local printers but everything was way too expensive. Minimum orders were like 50 shirts and I had no clue if anyone would even buy them. So I started small with print on demand just to test the waters. My friends ordered a few and wore them around campus which actually gave me some confidence\n\nThe hard part wasn’t design, it was figuring out how to get people to care. Marketing was way harder than I expected. I made an Insta page, got like 100 followers, then hit a wall. I didn’t have time to post daily or run ads, and I didn’t wanna beg friends to buy stuff\n\nAfter a few months I basically ran out of steam. I sold maybe 20 shirts total. Nothing crazy but it was fun seeing something I made actually out there in the world\n\nLooking back now, I realize I rushed into it without a real plan. I should’ve done more research on brand positioning and maybe tested more designs before launching\n\nIf any of you have done something similar, what would you have done differently? Like, if you were starting a clothing brand in college today, how would you go about it?",

Call it \"It Has Pockets!\" or similar. Have a way for customers to choose from a variety of pocket styles/sizes/materials, pick up the clothing or have a drop-off point on campus (or a nearby drycleaner or something), add the pockets, drop the clothing back or have it available for pickup. Fast turnaround times and college-centric branding (to start) to emphasize it's a student-run microbusiness. Talk to some tailoring businesses in the area to see what they'd charge to do the same work, to get an idea of market prices and whether it would be simpler to just whitebox/resell their services, do the sewing yourself, or have a couple of part-time employees, maybe even 'work at home' people who are interested in the concept, have the sewing skills, and would prefer you handle pickup/dropoff.",

Being in the field of IT and having already some clients through referrals would be enough to kick off with marketing.\n\nUsually you would have 3 options. Hire a freelancer, hire in-house or hire with a marketing company/agency.\n\nHiring freelancer might be the most economical, but need to be careful, lots of people in freelancing might promise but under-deliver for what you've paid. But once you find a great one with honest work, it will be great asset for the business. Just heads up with the professionals. Always ask for referrals and previous work. \n\nHiring in-house is ratherly expensive these days and also there is the process of hiring. But you have the option to choose a great experienced marketer which could pay itself off. The only issue with this is really the cost to the business.\n\nHiring a company/agency might feel a little better but there's a similar issue to the freelancers which is over-promising but under-delivering, only under a contract. I would say hiring a company is the riskiest because of the contracts. But if you work with a company that's great at their jobs and at least can provide a fine ROI, they will be reliable partner. Cost is more than freelancer but usually less than in-house but it has an advantage because you hire a whole team.\n\n\nThere is also a +1 option which is to learn yourself, but as you've said, it's time consuming and even more time consuming to master it. But once you've master it, there are no additional costs you would have to pay. \n\nI just wanted to point out the important details during your search. As long as you don't fall for false promises you're all good. Important to always keep in mind \"no one can promise or guarantee results in the field of marketing\"\n\nIf you would like to, we can just discuss further. Not trying to pitch myself, but I can share some of expertise if you don't know the market at all.",

          "body": "You have a niche problem as well. Why would someone buy a website from a cyber security business and vice versa? I run a web agency, I’m actually from NW Indiana. You need to focus on one niche - the websites or the IT stuff. If you want to do both, spin off the web design stuff as a DBA and make a new brand for just that and keep the IT brand seperate. \n\nThen, you need your google business profiles for each one, with lots of reviews. Then you need your location pages for your different services and locations like “cyber security experts in Rockford, IL” and Chicago, and Naperville, and oak park.  A home page can’t rank for every service and every location. You make pages specific for each one so they have a better shot at ranking and being found. \n\nThen there’s blogging. You need to write a blog answering the most commonly searched questions related to your work. Use a service like this \n\nhttps://answerthepublic.com\n\nAnd find a topic to write about. This will bring visitors to the site and add more content and authority in Google’s eyes. A good blog answers questions. \n\nNext is get off fiver. Full of low quality leads that are bottom of the barrel on pricing. They don’t value your skills. They value paying as little as possible. Not great clients. \n\nChicago is a tough market because it’s competitive. Ranking won’t be easy. And you might need to hire an SEO guy. But you might also benefit from running targeted Google ads to show up for searched related to your services and send them to a landing page for that ad and convert them into a custom who submits and form or calls you. That’s the fastest and easier way to go about it. Ads are hard, I can recommend my Google ads guy if you’d like. He does great work. As well as SEO. I send all my clients to him. Does great work.",

So your kpi's would be: how many visited your site, signed up to x marketing thing, contacted you etc. \nThey then need to be able to onboard those new eads &amp; prospects into a sales funnel - offers for early adopters, promo's, relationship building, whatever your end goal is or your own success metrics are. \nSo these 3 steps should be part of your person's competencies: identifying target markets, route to those markets (lead gen &amp; digital and/or traditional marketing) and 3rdly conversion into sales plan.

It's the equivalent of putting up a quick and dirty billboard made with microsoft word\n\nYour kind of work is not about big picture marketing, you just need to pay for search ads and those ads need to lead to an attractive landing page that is good at generating leads. Yes technically this is marketing but you don't need to be hitting up social media or paying for TV ads or anything like that.\n\nOnce you have a good looking functional website with good SEO and a well done landing page for your paid ads, it's basically set and forget. This admittedly is a whole can of worms to learn in of itself but seeing as you make websites already half the battle you can do yourself. It is worthwhile effort to learn effort if you're at all good with research and happen to have the time (because its slow). Alternatively you can outsource this to a google ads/SEO manager, which can be worth it. I'd find someone reputable local to do help you if you decide you have the budget to do it vs doing it yourself because ads/SEO people are a minefield of wannabes, scammers, and fake results. Maybe you can reach out to one of your current/past clients who seem to have a good ad/web presence and ask who they use?\n\nExpect to spend something like 10-15% on revenue on ads + management of them by the way if you want good results. It's worth it. We went through a slump at the beginning of this year and started spinning ads up for the first time. It's been a learning process but its absolutely paid for itself within the first month. For your industry in particular you could probably benefit from a real SEO guy you pay monthly on contract (again, ask locally), because to really kill it on the SEO front requires posting lots of relevant articles a month to your website involving your field. This signals to google that you're an authority on the subject (plus GPT searches really like that kind of content), and for your type of business coming off as an authority on information relating to what you do is valuable (vs a restaurant or a mill shop where its less useful). At least that's how it was last I checked - the google SEO landscape changes all the damn time so maybe posting frequent articles isn't so hot right now. But yeah - a good SEO guy will completely take care of all of that for you. \n\nAlso it should be said - focus on local. Go to business networking meetups, find other businesses and be seen in person. Get coffee/lunch dates with people you want to connect with. This builds healthy foundations and relationships for your business which are the real secret to success.",

Timesheets and invoicing workflows depend a lot on your specific setup.\n\nThe receipts and expense tracking side got way easier for us when we switched to Ramp - that cut down on a chunk of the bookkeeper questions and manual reconciliation stuff. \n\nAt 40k MRR you're probably right that a full time finance person is premature, but you might be at the point where a part time bookkeeper who does more than just answer your questions could take some of this off your plate. Or even a VA for invoice follow ups. The goal isn't to get to 0 hours (impossible) but getting it under 5 to 7 hours seems doable with the right automation + delegation.\n\n  \nHope it helped :)",

That translates directly into productivity, security, and way less “hey can you give me access to \\_\\_\\_?” noise.\n\nAt your stage, this isn't a “nice to have.” It’s the difference between scaling cleanly vs. slowly drowning in admin.\n\nRippling is the move — you’ll feel the impact from day one.",

      "selftext": "When I launched my catering company last year, I thought I'd found the perfect commercial kitchen space at $35/hour. The advertised rate seemed reasonable, but after signing the contract, I discovered the true cost was closer to $55/hour when you factor in mandatory cleaning fees, storage charges, and equipment usage fees that weren't mentioned upfront.\n\nThis got me thinking - how many other food entrepreneurs get blindsided by these hidden kitchen rental costs? I've talked to other caterers and ghost kitchen operators who've had similar experiences where the advertised rate was 30-50% lower than what they actually ended up paying.\n\nWhat hidden costs have you encountered in your food business operations, and how do you vet potential kitchen spaces to avoid these surprises?",

          "body": "If I were in front of you, I’d first say, in a spirit of friendly advice:  Read all of the words in a contract before signing it.  If you have to, upload it into ChatGPT and prompt it to summarize the contract as if you were a 5-year-old.  Then prompt it to tell you all of the hidden costs and total them.\n\nNow that you have them and understand them, shop for another kitchen space while negotiating the contract terms.  Your business depends on a solid relationship with the lessor…taking the time to go over the details with him/her and finding something that works for both of you can be beneficial.  At the very least, it makes you look like a valuable partner rather than just a lessee.\n\nRemember, though, they got to this point through trial and error to make their business run without a lot of hiccups, and you’re now a hiccup to them by negotiating rather than just accepting the terms.  You have to give something to create value for them, not just take for yourself.\n\nAnd…now that you’ve been in business for a year, try raising your prices by 5% to start making those hidden costs back.  That 5% will bring in new clients and force others to drop off, leaving you with a stronger client base and more revenues.  You’ll also find it easier to attract higher-paying clients and make smarter investments in services that will meet their needs, continuing the virtuous circle.",

Our small business has used them religiously since 2022 with many issues caused by bad CS advice, but here's the straw that broke the camel's back: We had 1 returned payment of \\~$500 this last week as we migrated bank accounts. Now Gusto is demanding we wire the funds in advance. Called CS, who was very nice, but explained that they are unable to do anything because their team in assurance won't take phone calls or call me back to discuss. The CS rep was extremely nice and patient with me, but the Gusto policy here is absolutely crazy.\n\nTLDR; avoid Gusto. They used to be great a few years back, but they've increasingly lost their way and it's not getting better.\n\nEdit --- it wasn't an entire payroll that got returned. It was a single ACH of $500 when we process 40x this each week in payroll with them. They then reprocessed it the next day and it cleared. Not saying I wasn't ultimately responsible, but Gusto has zero risk or liability here. They didn't process the payment and when I went to run payroll for the following week - wire required. No call, no conversation, and customer service couldn't transfer me to the team responsible to explain the situation. ",

          "body": "The secret to success in a paper/stationery store today is creating an experience and community that online retailers can’t replicate, while being strategic about your product mix.\n\nHere are the key elements:\nFind your niche identity. Don’t try to compete with Amazon on basic office supplies. Instead, become the destination for something specific: beautiful Japanese stationery, bullet journaling supplies, luxury fountain pens, eco-friendly products, or locally-designed goods. People will travel and pay premium prices for specialty items they can touch and test.\n\nMake it tactile and experiential. Your biggest advantage is that customers can feel paper weights, test pens, see colors in person, and discover products they didn’t know existed. Create testing stations, offer workshops on calligraphy or bookbinding, host journaling meetups. The store should be a place people want to spend time, not just transact.\n\nBuild community. Stationery enthusiasts are passionate and congregate online, but crave real-world connection. Become a hub for local artists, students, planners, and writers. Host events, feature local creators, maintain a social media presence that celebrates your customers’ creativity.\n\nCurate thoughtfully. Stock what big boxes don’t: independent brands, imports, artist collaborations, and products with stories. People shopping small want to feel they’re discovering something special.\nDiversify revenue. Add services like custom printing, monogramming, gift wrapping, or even a small café corner. Consider subscription boxes or strong online/local delivery to supplement foot traffic.\n\nThe stores thriving now are destinations with personality, not just retail spaces. With this in mind, you can add a complimentary business within the space.\n\nA complementary business can drive foot traffic, increase average transaction value, and make your space a destination. Here are some winning combinations:\n\nCoffee/Tea Bar - This is probably the most natural pairing. People browse stationery, then sit with a latte to journal or write cards. It encourages lingering, creates ambiance, and the profit margins on beverages are excellent. You could even theme drinks around products (“The Moleskine Mocha”).\n\nPrint/Copy Services - Custom printing, business cards, invitations, zine printing. You already have paper-loving customers; offer them services too. Wedding invitation consultations can be particularly lucrative.\n\nGift Wrapping Station - Not just supplies but a premium wrapping service. During holidays this could be a significant revenue stream, and it positions your store as a gifting destination.\n\nBookstore/Book Section - Small press books, local authors, beautiful editions, journals and planners. The customer overlap is nearly perfect, and it extends browsing time.\n\nArt Supplies Corner - Watercolors, brush pens, sketchbooks. Many stationery lovers also draw or do hand-lettering.\n\nVinyl/Record Selection - Sounds random, but hear me out: both attract collectors who appreciate physical media and craftsmanship. Creates an interesting vibe and crossover appeal.\n\nWorkshop/Event Space - Rent it out for small meetings, creative workshops, book clubs. Generates income during off-hours and builds community.\n\nThe best choice depends on your interests (you’ll be managing it!), your local market gaps, and your space constraints. What draws you? Or what’s missing in your area?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

          "body": "Yeah, online will be an absolute must for you. Maybe even same day local delivery.\n\nI love stationery, and I love going to stationery stores, but since I stopped working in the city I never have chance to get to one, and I'm certainly not going to travel to one when I can fire up amazon. I don't even use the website of the art shop I used to go to, because amazon will get things to me tomorrow, and that's what you're up against.\n\nI think you could really embrace the local community with same day local delivery or similar? Click and collect style service at a minimum.\n\nIf there's room, then obvious complementary services are renting out spray booths, taking order for  3D printing, CnC machines etc.\n\nAnd as cliche as it sounds, if you can find room for a coffee and cake area, you'll find a lot of people who love art shops also love to spend hours in there - providing sustenance at a profit is a fairly logical move. You'll probably find that it doesn't need to be the final work in high end coffee, just something to keep them going whilst they doodle on a sofa or table.\n\nI would also say if you can turn it into something else of an evening, like push the shelves back and have some poetry nights, or comedy, or small live music, basically turn yourself into a arts hub, not just a shop for pencils during the day.\n\nI'll be honest though, this definitely has vibes of art / stationery being a passion of yours, and you wanting to make a living from it...which is great, but is rarely a recipe for success. You really need to know if there's actually a market for it before you commit to anything else, and if you've not worked retail before, speak to someone who runs their own small store, because it's a huge time and money drain getting stocked and opened, and then the hours can be a real bitch, to be frank.",

Started my greeting card line out of my house in 2013; had an Etsy shop and did lots of pop-ups and markets, and developing my wholesale line before going for it full-time a couple years later.\n\nI’ve had a brick and mortar since 2016. Even in a tourist town and having my own line where the margins are much better, it’s still an uphill battle. I’ve taught workshops and have a good social media presence. I was married, and while his paycheck certainly provided the stability to take risks, I’ve worked really hard to keep this thing afloat.\n\nThe space I was in from 2017-2024 was a giant storefront on Magazine street where we had our letterpress studio in the back, visible for people to see us making the cards. Cool in theory, but not enough to justify the massive overhead. The front half of the store was way too big for what we sold best (cards, pens, stickers, wrapping paper), so I filled it with gifty crap that diluted my brand. Required a big team and lots of capital to keep the inventory stocked. High gross sales, but barely breaking even.\n\nLast year, I moved my print studio to a big, cheap warehouse space, and moved the shop to a tiny jewel box in a fancier part of the neighborhood. Pivoted to custom wedding invitations.\n\nThe business is finally profitable for the first time in years. I’m really proud of myself. There’s no rich husband, just a scrappy gal with a lot of creativity.\n\nGreeting cards are our bread &amp; butter. It’s something people don’t turn to Amazon for, and love the experience of shopping the wall in person on their way to an event— and yes, we can gift wrap that for you too!\n\nOur pen wall is a big focus and it’s so fun seeing people light up at the rainbow of Gelly rolls they can try out. \n\nWe have built an amazing community of regulars and meet new fans of the brand every day. \n\nI don’t have all the answers, I’ve pivoted so many times I’m still dizzy from the COVID years. Just wanted to share my journey in case it helps yours.",

Once everything’s running smoothly, maintenance is usually just a few hours a month.\n\nTrying to patch it yourself isn’t sustainable, it’s eating into your focus and growth.

          "body": "I didn't see anyone mention this, but it's time to build KM (Knowledge Management) capability in your small business. This is more than just a tech issue.   \n  \nYour business continuity is at stake if you or an employee get sick, quit, get hospitalized or something unforseen, family emergency, etc. Also, when adding more employees later, you want them at near 100% as quickly as possible, so a proper onboarding &amp; offboarding &amp; knowledge capture/sharing process will help you long-term, and make your company as a whole more valuable if you one-day want to sell it so the new owner can jump right in.  \n  \nBut here are some items you might want to look into: \n\n1. A proper CMS (Content Management System). Not just a file dump, a secure space for collaboration where all files are tracked.   \n  \n2. A strict taxonomy like Customer Name, Project Name, Project Number, Type of file (Requirements, Schedule, Mockups, etc), etc...  \n  \n3. Version control - every change creates a new file, and information about the changes should be written by the developer.\n\n4. File Check out/Check in - it will show you who's using the file and shouldn't be messed with until that person is \n\n5. All files should be stored in the CMS, and the CMS should have a strict backup schedule onsite &amp; cloud. \n\n6. Consider a backup tool for each of your employees laptops, in the event something happened, you could have it autorestore to a new laptop in a few hours without losing your time. You can even look through different cloud backups and copy the exact files you need.\n\n7. Not sure how you manage your projects, if its all informal (emails, chats, site visits, video calls, excel spreadsheets), but consider a tracking system separate from your CMS, that allows you or anyone to manage tasks using a ticketing type of system. This allows you in the future to have account managers + project managers + secretary + devs all interacting with the clients and adding to the project - if a dev gets sick, a new one can jump in and follow the ticket thread and be ready. Clients get frustrated when they called in a change, but that information didn't get shared in time.\n\nAll in all, this is a tech + people + process type of situation, hiring only an IT firm/person might only fix part of the problem now, but as you grow or the organization evolves there might be more headaches along the way.\n\nGood Luck!",

          "body": "it’s work that needs to be done\n\nat your size, small businesses outsource their IT to a guy or a company — usually local, you want onsite response when you need it in a reasonable time frame, because you don’t have in-house it/support staff to assist. \n\nbeing somewhat tech savvy, you can save some money on service calls, because you know how/can figure out/can be talked through most of the common issues. \n\nsome notes:\n\n- phishing emails and other security issues are very education driven. you gotta do the small stuff, like keep OSes and software updated, but that ain’t gonna stop people from clicking malicious links - and humans are the biggest security vulnerability any of us have. you can’t stop someone from giving out their password or a 2fa code or unwittingly handing over email access with any security software - you need to train your folks. \n\n- file versioning/management is process driven. you need to set a process for shared files, and enforce it. you can keep using dropbox or drive, one cloud, or deploy your own nextcloud (prob too much) but whatever it is — you need to lay down the law on its usage. \n\n- dropbox for biz does backups, but having your own backup would be wise. it provider might offer services to back your stuff up at their location (basically you give them dropbox access and they do a full copy and take it offline every day). you can also do the same on site, or even at your house. but you’ll want automation around it — unless it’s automated, you have no backup. \n\n- wifi is an easy fix. don’t use the shit ass hardware spectrum or cox or att or whomever distributes, for wifi. get proper enterprise grade wifi equipment. ubiquiti is pretty industry standard. it’s not the cheapest, but depending on your office size and layout, you may not need much hardware. we’re mid office transiton and i have 20-25 people (so like 50-60 devices) running off a single ubiquity access point, and it’s only 40% utilized (ish) - set costs up about $2k. \n\n- extra note; if you’re not requiring your entire team to use 1password or bit warden — start. like, today. making it easy to have strong passwords and 2fa for every service, that’s easier to use than NOT using them, is a game changer. you’ll tighten up security just by requiring people to use that - instead of freaking chrome saved passwords. i distribute a device management profile that disables saving passwords in chrome. not only does it help you keep things secure, it makes on and off boarding easier, and gives you a secure way to share login credentials when needed. no joke, i have heard of employees saving passwords in notes on their phone, or even as contacts. no bueno.",
