      "selftext": "ok so idk if anyone else is dealing with this but reddit is such a weird place when you’re trying to help people without sounding like a scammer lol. my whole thing is helping people start side hustles, like normal stuff, websites, small online income, nothing flashy. but the moment you even *sound* like you know what you’re doing, ppl either assume you’re lying or ask for a step by step blueprint and then disappear when you actually reply. feels like shouting into the void half the time.\n\ni’ll see posts like “how do i start a side hustle with $0” and i’m like cool, this is literally my lane. i comment, try to be genuine, no links, no selling, just experience. sometimes it pops off, sometimes mods nuke it, sometimes i get messages that are like “bro can you explain everything from scratch” and then they ghost after 2 messages. or they want results yesterday. like sorry my guy, this isn’t a get rich quick tiktok reel.\n\nalso funny thing is the people who *do* messages are usually the most confused. they’ve watched 100 youtube videos, saved 50 twitter threads, and still haven’t done step one. they want reassurance more than advice. i catch myself halfway through typing a long reply on my phone like… why am i working harder than the person asking for help.\n\ni guess the lesson (if there is one) is reddit inbound works but only if you’re ok with chaos, patience, and a lot of conversations going nowhere. some seeds randomly grow though. most don’t. still figuring out if that’s just how it is or if i’m doing something dumb. probably both 🤷‍♂️",

          "body": "Just flip stuff.\n\nDownload apps like DealScout and FreebieAlerts that send you push notifications when listings that match your search criteria are posted, and then just go pick up whatever deals look best. They send you push notifications as soon as things are listed so that you are the first one to be able to message and go get a really good deal if something is listed way below what it’s worth.\n\nIt’s something that you can do during your days off, but also something that you can do in the morning/evenings before and after work and you can do the searching/lock down deals while at work.   \n  \nI’ve seen people in this sub that have commutes that are two hours long set up the app to look for things along their path to and from work and then they just set up pick ups/drop offs along their commute and they make a couple hundred extra bucks every week pretty much just doing the same thing they’re already doing.\n\nThat’s how most of these big guys are flipping cars, couches, phones, and other types of stuff. They aren’t paying the normal prices that you see, they’re paying way less and they’re doing that by being the first one to go get these deals from these people that underprice them either because they don’t know the value, or don’t care about the value and just want it gone.\n\nMy advice would be just find something that you know a lot about, use an app to look for you, and just pick up the best deals and make sure that you’re the first message. Pretty easy to make a couple hundred extra bucks a week and 100% something you can do while working because it doesn't take any work to find these if you're doing it right, and then all of the actual \"work\" you have to do can happen before/after normal work hours",

I started with $1,000 and have flipped my way up into a $10,000 Challenger. I try to only buy or trade for “flashy” vehicles for they eye catching value marketing wise and it’s worked pretty well. What I can’t for the life of me figure out is how to narrow down my inbox to people who are actually serious and not wasting my time. If I post something for $6k I get 100 messages offering $3k when I clearly state “I will not take any less the $6k so please don’t ask.” I get 200 notifications and without responding to every single one I feel like I’ll miss that ONE that’s the sale/deal. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

Takes time to build up reviews but once you have them the work comes more regularly. I do basic stuff like content writing and data formatting. Started slow but it's been consistent for almost a year now.\n\nSurvey apps get a bad rep and honestly 90% of survey apps are useless. But there are a few reliable ones that have worked long term. Prolific and Babki are the main ones I still use after trying like 10 different platforms. Most survey apps either don't pay out or the availability drops off after a few weeks. These two have stayed consistent for me over several months.\n\nI'm curious what's worked for other people long term.

      "selftext": "Hii,\n\nI’m a bit out of the teachers game. I taught until 2020, and then worked 4 years in education with the National Park Service. I’m now an educational outdoor ed program manager. I work adjacent to kids and teachers, but I am not day to day with them.\n\nI’m looking at boosting up my TPT store again, but am unsure of the market or what is popular. I’m doing this because my family cannot afford childcare in our area and continue to afford our healthcare needs. We need a financial cushion of about $1k extra a month. \n\nWe can’t budget our way out of this. We looked at every possibility and we are, quite frankly, fucked.\n\nmy husband already works overtime as a first responder. I’m salaried and need a “side hustle” to make any extra money. My thoughts are start and Etsy store or revamp my TPT store. Considering I have/had a semi successful TPT store, this seems more practical.\n\nContext. I had a TPT store from 2018-2020. I made about $200 a month when I tried regularly. Right now, I make about $60 a month on it. I don’t touch it at all. I mostly made content for middle school social studies. There are about 35 products on my store and 400 reviews. about 10 of those products male 90% of my sales. I’m not stating from scratch, but I’ve also never made big money either.\n\n$200 a month was myself as new teacher in her early 20s who didn’t understand a lot of things. My products were fine, but they could all use some good revamping. also this was before AI (or myself) could reliably proof read 😬\n\nMy questions are the following:\n\n1. What sells well for middle school now? what do you look for?\n2. Do products need to be digitized for Google Classroom? I have done this to a few. are there any other digital platforms forms to consider?\n3. I used to promote it via Pinterest. is there another platform to promote it on? Substack? what do yall use?\n4. Is $1k a month too lofty of a goal? hoping to dedicate 10 hours a week to it and would like to hit 1k by September to keep us from financial ruin.\n5. I also make a lot of cross grade “Buddy Activities” for work that are more geared towards lower grades. They aren’t elaborate but they are thoughtful and themed. Are these worth anything to teachers?\n\nMy plan is to revamp a lot of products and create some new ones about maybe more niche subjects i have experience in, such as California natural resources and geography. \n\nI’m open to feedback back and also willing to hear about other side hustles that have worked well for teachers ",

Plus you’re 14, you won’t have an easy way of getting suppliers to work with you even if you tried. And half the crap you see online about it, it’s just influencers who don’t even go into the full scope of things. \n\nBut at 14 years old, I’d suggest putting that lawn mower to work. Ask any of your neighbors if they’d be willing to pay you to do their yards. Or if you live somewhere where it’s snowing, you could offer shoveling services. You could sell the oculus and ds I guess but it depends how much you list each item for and if anyone is willing to buy it off your hands in the first place. Maybe become a dog walker ?

When I was in middle school I found out everyone hated the school uniform so I spoke with the principal and after negotiations, I convinced him to allow for a new uniform design. I already knew from interviewing everyone at school what they were looking for. I didn’t become rich, obviously, but I bough myself an xbox 360 and managed to pay for all my dates with girls (mostly movies and food at the mall). Then I did the same in high school.",

Another thing: to really learn and see results, no matter which side hustle you choose, you need to start taking action and testing things. If you can bring a computer and use it during your commute, you can start taking action.

But don't make much from it.\n\nKnowing how to do it is the easy part, finding people who will pay you enough to suppliment your job is a completely different thing. Maybe you have some connections then you could make it work but otherwise you might have to do both for a while to have a little bit of confidence.\n\nI would not recommend you yolo into this and quit or reduce your hours.

      "selftext": "This is gonna sound super niche but I started renting out baby stuff to tourists through the internet about 11 months ago and its turned into way better income than I expected.\n\nI live near a popular spring destination and we get tons of families visiting for sports events and vacations. Parents don't wanna fly with car seats, cribs, strollers, all that bulky stuff so they just rent it when they get here. I started with a car seat and pack n play I bought secondhand for like $80 total, cleaned them up real good and listed them.\n\nFirst month I made maybe $200 but then summer hit and I was getting $600-800 monthly. Now I've got 6 car seats, 3 cribs, 2 strollers, a high chair and some other random stuff. Last month I cleared $1,240 and I probably spent 4 hours total on dropoffs and pickups.\n\nThe best part is most of the gear just sits in my garage between rentals. I'll get a booking notification, confirm it, drop the stuff off at their hotel or rental, then pick it up when they leave. Sometimes I don't even see them cause they leave it with the front desk. Takes 20 mins max per rental.\n\nInitial investment was around $900 for everything and I hit break even after month 3. Now its pretty much pure profit minus the occasional replacement if something breaks. Been throwing most of it toward my emergency fund which needed some padding anyway.\n\nOnly annoying part is when people are weird about used gear even though everything gets sanitized between uses. Had one lady ask if the car seat was \"certified clean\" like there's some official baby gear certification lmao. But 95% of people are super chill and just happy they dont have to lug their own stuff through the airport.",

But my new gold standard is putting in a few hours of \"setup\" and then seeing money come for years to come. Literally maybe spending 2 seconds every month on it after set up.\n\nFor me, that gold standard is **OOH (Out-of-Home) Advertising.**\n\nI didn't buy a $100k highway billboard. I went DIY. Here is the breakdown:\n\n* **The Location:** Found a high-traffic intersection and made a deal with the landowner to let me place it there.\n* **The Listing:** Put a \"Your Ad Here\" sign with my number on the bench and listed the space on [**ADVR: Advertising Marketplace**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/advr-advertising-marketplace/id6745561123) (it's an app that connects owners with advertisers).\n* **The Result:** A local tree service company found the listing. They now pay me **$700/year** to have their logo on that bench.\n* **The Profit:** I pay the landowner **$200/year** for the \"rent.\" I net **$500/year** in profit for doing literally nothing once the deal was signed. (not including the $70 it cost for me to create the bench)\n\n**Why this beats other \"passive\" income:**\n\n1. **Low Maintenance:** Once the bench is bolted down and the ad is applied, I spend maybe a 2 second glance checking on it on my way to work.\n2. **Physical Asset:** I own the bench. If the advertiser leaves, the bench stays.\n3. **Scalability:** If I do this 10 times, that’s $5,000/year. If I do it 100 times... you get the math.\n\nIt’s not \"get rich quick.\" It’s \"build something once and get paid for a long time.\" This could then transpire into a billboard.\n\nHere's the proof in the pudding.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qsqmakj7mlhg1.png?width=1042&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd2b2fb5198bdc675c9033d502b11f7fba5bb775\n\n",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nMy name is Nicolas and if you've read my previous posts you know I went from baker to making $1.5M with a WordPress product, then lost most of it because I was young and stupid. Life has been hard but I'm back doing what I love, building products.\n\nToday I want to share something different, not a story about my past, but a business model that's exploding right now and I believe anyone can start with almost no money. I'm talking about selling AI assistants to small businesses.\n\nBefore you click away thinking this is some technical stuff for developers, just keep reading. I'm going to break this down into steps so simple that my kid who never touched code in his life could do it.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding why this works**\n\nEvery day, thousands of small businesses are losing money because they miss phone calls. Think about it, a plumber is under a sink, a dentist is with a patient, a massage therapist is in session. Someone calls, nobody picks up, that potential customer calls the next business on Google and money is lost.\n\nBig companies have receptionists and call centers, small ones don't have that luxury. But now, AI can answer calls, book or cancel appointments, answer questions, and do it 24/7 for a fraction of what a human employee costs. We're talking about something that can save a business thousands of dollars while making them more money by never missing a lead.\n\nThe beauty is you don't need to build the AI yourself. There are platforms that do all the heavy lifting, you just need to set it up and sell the service. You become the person who connects small businesses with technology they don't even know exists.\n\n**Step 2: Finding your first clients (this is where most people fail)**\n\nHere's what nobody tells you about starting a business, the product is rarely the problem. Finding customers is, and with this model, finding customers is actually the easy part if you know where to look.\n\nGo on LinkedIn right now and search for job postings. Look for small businesses hiring receptionists, administrative assistants, or customer service reps. These companies are literally telling you they need help answering phones and managing customer inquiries. They're about to spend like $2000 a month on a salary plus benefits, training, sick days, and vacations. You can offer them an AI solution for a fraction of that price that works nights and weekends without complaining.\n\nDo the same on Indeed or even Google. Search your local area for receptionist positions at dental offices, law firms, real estate agencies, salons. Every single one of these is a potential client who already has a budget allocated for solving the exact problem you're about to solve cheaper and better.\n\nYou can also just drive around your neighborhood. If you see a sign for a local business? Call their number after hours.\n\nIf it goes to voicemail or nobody picks up, that's a potential client. Take note, come back the next day with your pitch.\n\n**Step 3: Creating your demo**\n\nHere's where you separate yourself from all the people who send generic cold emails that get deleted. Before you contact any business, you're going to spend 15 to 30 minutes creating a demo specifically for them.\n\nLet's say you found a dental office called Bright Smiles Dental hiring a receptionist. You set up a quick AI assistant demo that says something like \"Hi, thanks for calling Bright Smiles Dental. I'm here to help you schedule an appointment, answer questions about our services, or connect you with our team. How can I help you today?\"\n\nYou customize it with their business name, their services, their hours, their FAQ and anything you found useful on their website. When you call them, you're not pitching an idea, you're showing them exactly what their customers would experience. That changes everything, it goes from \"let me tell you about this thing\" to \"listen to what I already built for you.\"\n\n**Step 4: Pick up the phone**\n\nI know everyone wants to hide behind emails and LinkedIn messages and with many AI tools these days, it is very easy to get emails and reach people automatically but trust me on this, the phone is your best friend. Cold emails get ignored, but phone calls get answered almost always.\n\nHere's a simple script that works:\n\n\"Hi, this is \\[your name\\], I noticed you're looking to hire a receptionist and I wanted to show you something that might help you saving $XXXX per year. I've set up an AI assistant specifically for your business that can answer calls 24/7, book appointments, and never take a sick day. Can I send you a 30-second demo so you can hear exactly how it would work for your customers?\"\n\nYou will for sure get people who will refuse but most will say yes because you're offering something free and it only takes 30 seconds of their time. Once they hear the demo with their business name, their brain starts imagining the possibilities. That's when you schedule a proper call to close the deal.\n\n**Step 5: Pricing and scaling**\n\nStart simple, charge $100 to $200 per month per client, depending on their volume + a one-time fee for the initial setup. Your costs for the AI platform will be somewhere between $30 to $80 depending on usage and minutes consumed. That leaves you with $50 to $120 profit per client every single month.\n\nGet 10 clients and you're making $500 to $1200 per month in recurring revenue, 30 clients and you're at $1500 to $3600 per month for something that takes you maybe 10 hours a week to maintain. It really depends on YOU to move your ass and get more and more businesses to call.\n\nThe best part is once you set up a client, the work is minimal. Maybe a few hours per month for adjustments and support. This is money that hits your account every single month as long as the client stays happy. And trust me, when a business stops missing calls and starts getting more bookings, they don't cancel.\n\nAs you get better, you can add services like follow-up sequences, review requests, or appointment reminders. Each add-on is another reason for them to stay and another way to increase your monthly revenue per client.\n\n**Why am I sharing this for free?**\n\nEvery time I post something helpful, someone asks what's the catch. There is no catch, I believe the best way to build a community and maybe even find future business partners or customers is to share real value without asking for anything in return.\n\nI've been through enough in my life to know that money comes and goes but the relationships you build and the people you help along the way are what actually matter. Call me idiot if you want but I genuinely believe that when you help others succeed, good things come back to you eventually.\n\nNow I want to hear from you. Has anyone already started something similar? What's stopping you from trying this? Drop your questions in the comments and I'll try to answer everyone.\n\nLet's build something great together 🙌\n\n**EDIT:** For all the haters in the comments, I became a developer 15 years ago because strangers on the internet shared their knowledge for free on YouTube and forums without expecting anything in return. That changed my life, so yeah, I will keep sharing free tips, business ideas, and anything that can help others for as long as I can. Some of you clearly don't understand why someone would do that, and honestly that says more about you than it does about me. To everyone else who appreciated this post, thank you, you're the reason I keep writing 🙏",

Buy a used vending machine on Craigslist or Marketplace for a couple hundred bucks. Then find a local business, like an auto repair shop, where customers have to wait around for service, and ask them if you can set up the machine in their waiting area. People eat when they’re bored. Stock up on snacks from a warehouse club (BJs, Costco). Bulk snacks cost like $0.50/each, and sell them for $1.50. You’d just have to visit the shop periodically to refill stock.",

          "body": "I'm not sure this would work the same today with the likes of ChatGPT writing things. I've been a salesman since 1984, but never wanted to be. I spent a lot of time coldcalling, telemarketing, and doing direct sales copywriting.\n\nIn 2005, I began selling chess sets and books on ebay and Amazon as a side hustle. I had over 400 different products, but couldn't keep it going due to my job being too busy. I quit that job and moved to Austria in 2015, where it soon became clear that my savings wouldn't last long, so I began doing freelance telemarketing. This became a full-time job, and I used to make around 400 calls a day, either commission only, or low pay with a good bonus.\n\nI got decent money and was looking to set up an agency, however, a guy who was trying to sell sports bags on Amazon got in touch to see if I could rewrite his products as they weren't selling. He'd bought a chess set from me some years before as a gift and liked the description so much that he bought himself one too. I charged him a fiver, rewrote his product and they sold out in six weeks.\n\nCopywriting became my side hustle because more people heard what happened and asked me to do the same. It became clear that I could make more money doing the side hustle than my job, so I put my energy into that. Agencies began to contact me and I was shocked at how much they charged. So I set up an agency with 17 freelancers and we did copywriting, product photography, graphic design, keyword research, and translations. In the first year, 2018, we completed 500 projects. I burned out trying to manage everyone and didn't make much money.\n\nSome of my best clients had been pushing me to manage their ppc advertising, and so I agreed, and ringfenced a small group of customers to work as a solo consultant.\n\nFast forward to 2026, and I'm still managing Amazon PPC for sellers and auditing people's products. I work part time, when I want. I sold 40k of training courses, and have been an advertising mentor for some Amazon software companies. I've trained over 400 students and agency staff.\n\nThis side hustle grew in ways I couldn't imagine.\n\nMy advice would be to learn Google PPC as it is similar and has a much broader, professional audience, than those selling on Amazon, and who are willing to pay more. Good luck.",

Most people spend months watching tutorials just to get one consistent face.\nI’ve spent the last few months engineering a Plug &amp; Play system designed to remove that bottleneck. This is for the person who wants the business results without becoming a full-time software debugger.\n\nThe \"Hands-Off\" Infrastructure includes:\nTotal Installation: I handle the backend software, custom nodes, and environment stability so it doesn't break every update.\n\n100% Face Consistency: A dual-layer IPAdapter and LoRA setup that \"locks\" your model's identity across 100+ generations.\n\nReverse Engineering: A workflow that takes any viral image and turns it into a usable prompt for your model automatically.\n\nThe Agency Stack: Face/Body swapping, SFW/NSFW transitions, and high-fidelity skin texture refiners for professional realism.\n\nWhy this is a \"Side Hustle\" engine:\nIndividuals: Skip the learning phase. Go from zero to generating consistent, high-ticket models in 24 hours.\nAgency Owners: Own your internal infrastructure instead of paying expensive content partners.",

It is not exciting, but it is real money and fully remote. Downside is income ceiling is low.\n\nIf you are open to learning a skill  \nPick one boring but useful skill and go all in for 90 days. Stuff like basic web design (Webflow or WordPress), simple automation with no code tools, short form video editing, or customer support ops. These are not glamorous but people actually pay for them.\n\nFreelancing gets a bad rep, but if you focus on one narrow service instead of “I do everything”, it works. For example, “I edit short videos for coaches” or “I set up email flows for small ecommerce stores”.\n\nIf you want something semi passive later  \nContent plus a service. Use the 3 months to talk about what you are learning, build proof, then sell a small service or digital product. This takes longer, but it compounds.\n\nOne thing I would avoid is hopping between ideas every week. Three months is enough time to either make your first dollars or at least know exactly why something did not work.\n\nIf you want, tell me whether you care more about fast income or long term skill building and I can suggest something more specific.",

You can run this completely faceless while still keeping the \"human connection.\"\n\n1. The Concept: Create a channel hosted by a recurring \"Wise Character\" (like an Old Monk or a Stoic Philosopher).\n2. Why it works: People connect with a face, even if it's digital. It builds trust way better than just stock footage of a waterfall.\n3. How to do it: I use Keyvello for this.\n   - Disclosure: It has a Free Trial/Free Tier available to test.\n   - Use the \"Viral Wisdom\" template. It generates a realistic talking character (like a Monk) that lip-syncs your meditation script automatically.\n\nSince you have 3 months of free time, you could easily build a library of 50+ videos.

I guess the dumb people expect everything from you for free and have no self motivation at all to follow through on your advice. Contrary smart people will be wary here of advice hidden as ads. Ultimately nothing is free that is worth getting/having especially when it comes to making money. Also you are having an agency, probably with a goal to drive sales to there although not your highest priority I guess. Which is totally fine imo, dont get me wrong. Offering genuine advice and positioning yourself as an expert is a great way to build trusting business relationships. Compared to the money gurus that promote get rich quick schemes for a quick buck to sell their lousy digital guides. \n\nI will also leave you my feedback while I am at it: You need to work on your agency’s website. It is all over the place - the colors (mobile menu, no noticeable color palette), different size images, repeated content, low res logo. As a web dev agency your website needs to be top notch. Because from a customer perspective I liked what you offered but seeing your website, how could I ever be sure to receive a good service when your site looks that way already.",

Your first job is NOT to be nice, it’s to organize them so we can kill most of them later.\n    First, ask me to paste ALL my ideas in one message, even if they’re messy.\n    Then: 1. Turn my brain dump into a clean, numbered list of ideas. 2. For each idea, write: - A 1-sentence description in plain English - Who would pay for it (specific type of customer) - HOW it might make money (1 sentence: subscription, service, product, etc.)\n    Do NOT evaluate them yet. Just organize the chaos so we can judge them ruthlessly later.\n\n**2)**\n\n    Act as a skeptical angel investor.\n    Using the numbered list of my ideas, score each one purely on its REVENUE potential.\n    Create a table where each idea gets a 0–10 score for: - Market demand - Willingness to pay - Pricing power (how high I can realistically charge) - Speed to first $1,000 - Realistic path to sustainable revenue within 12–18 months\n    Then: 1. Add a “Total Score” column and rank ideas from highest to lowest. 2. Briefly justify the score for each idea in 1–2 sentences. 3. Bold the top 3 ideas by total score.\n    Do not sugarcoat anything. If something looks weak, say it clearly.\n\n**3)**\n\n    Act as a ruthless idea executioner.\n    Using the scored list we already created, your job is to aggressively CUT ideas that are unlikely to make real money.\n    For each idea: 1. Give a quick verdict: - “STRONG CONTENDER” (keep) - “MAYBE LATER” - “KILL IT” 2. For every “KILL IT”, give a blunt 1–2 sentence reason focused on MARKET VIABILITY: - tiny market, low pricing power, hard to reach customers, etc.\n    Then: - Show me ONLY the ideas labeled “STRONG CONTENDER” in a short list. - Make sure at least 50–70% of ideas are killed or moved to “maybe later”.\n    Be direct. I care more about building a real business than protecting my feelings.\n\n**4)**\n\n    Act as my brutally honest advisor.\n    Here are my constraints: - Time I can work on this per week: [HOURS PER WEEK] - Money I’m willing to invest upfront: [BUDGET] - My main skills: [LIST SKILLS] - Things I refuse to do (or hate doing): [LIST THINGS]\n    Using ONLY the “STRONG CONTENDER” ideas: 1. For each idea, estimate: - Time to launch a basic MVP (in weeks) - Time to first realistic sale - Startup cost (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH, with a rough range) 2. Note how well my current skills match each idea (GOOD / OK / BAD). 3. Label each idea: - “REALISTIC PATH TO REVENUE FOR YOU” - “POSSIBLE BUT HEAVY LIFT” - “NOT A GOOD FIT WITH YOUR CURRENT REALITY”\n    Sort the list so the best fit ideas for ME are at the top. Don’t be optimistic, be realistic.\n\n**5)**\n\n    Act as a strategic consultant hired to pick my most profitable idea.\n    Using the top 3 “REALISTIC PATH” ideas: For each idea, answer:\n    1. WHO pays? Describe the ideal paying customer in detail.  \n    2. WHY they pay: the painful problem or strong desire (in their own words).  \n    3. HOW I get paid:\n       * What I’m actually selling  \n       * A realistic price point  \n       * How many customers I’d need to get to my revenue goal.  \n    4. MAIN OBSTACLES:\n       * What makes this hard (acquisition, competition, operations, etc.)\n    At the end, tell me which of the 3 has: - The clearest path to revenue - The lowest risk for me personally\n\n**6)**\n\n    Act as a lean startup coach obsessed with real-world proof, not theory.\n    Using my single best idea so far: [DESCRIBE IDEA IN 1 SENTENCE].\n    Design 2–3 fast validation experiments I can run in the next 7–14 days, with almost no budget.\n    For each experiment: 1. Describe the test clearly (e.g., landing page + waitlist, cold DMs, offer post, pre-sell call). 2. Give exact steps: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3… 3. Tell me what to measure (signups, replies, calls booked, pre-sales, etc.). 4. Define clear decision rules: - “If I do X and get Y or more, this is a GREEN LIGHT.” - “If I get less than Y, either pivot or kill the idea.”\n    Focus only on experiments that test: “Can this realistically make money?” Not branding, not logos.\n\n**7)**\n\n    Act as my therapist + business coach with zero filter.\n    I don’t just want a profitable idea, I want one I’ll actually stick with long enough to reach my goals.\n    First, ask me 8–10 questions about: - The type of work that energizes me vs drains me - The people I like / hate working with - How comfortable I am with sales and being visible online - My risk tolerance and stress tolerance - The lifestyle I want in 12–24 months\n    Then, using my top 2–3 ideas: 1. Explain how each idea fits or clashes with my personality and lifestyle. 2. Rate each idea on a “STICK-WITH-IT SCORE” from 0–10. 3. Call out any idea that looks great on paper but would probably make me miserable.\n    End by recommending ONE idea that balances money potential + emotional fit.\n\n**8)**\n\n    Act as my risk–reward analyst.\n    For the ONE idea you recommend I pursue, walk me through 3 scenarios over the next 12–24 months:\n    1. Best case:\n       * Approximate revenue range\n       * What my life and schedule look like\n       * Upside if things go better than expected\n    2. Realistic case:\n       * Approximate revenue range\n       * How many customers / clients that might be\n       * How much work per week\n    3. Worst case:\n       * What happens if it “fails”\n       * Skills I still gain\n       * How I can pivot those skills into another opportunity\n    Be conservative. I want sober expectations, not fantasy.\n\n**9)**\n\n    Act as my execution-obsessed co-founder.\n    Based on everything we’ve done, help me:\n    1. Confirm ONE idea I will commit to for the next 90 days.  \n    2. Outline a 90-day plan with 3 phases:\n       * Days 1–30: Validation &amp; first sale\n       * Days 31–60: Improve the offer &amp; delivery\n       * Days 61–90: Push toward a path that could scale\n    For each phase, include: - 3–5 concrete actions - Weekly targets (e.g., # of outreach messages, calls, offers sent) - Simple metrics that show I’m moving closer to my goals.\n    Finish by giving me the next 3 actions I should take THIS WEEK.",

Dividends need rebalancing, side projects drift and even the low effort stuff punishes you if you completely ignore it. Lately I’ve been more focused on small, boring consistency. Not chasing home runs just stacking things that don’t demand daily attention. A little dividend reinvestment, some automated savings rules and occasionally parking small amounts where the risk is defined. I even mess around with tiny, disciplined bets from time to time, mostly as an exercise in restraint. Did one recently on Bracco while checking lines, set it and walked away, which honestly felt closer to passive than most things I’ve tried.  \n  \n  \nI want to know how others here define passive at this point. Are you aiming for truly hands off or just low maintenance and predictable? What’s actually worked long term for you?t?  \n",

You invest, leave it alone, and let compounding do its thing. Not exciting, but very hands off. Digital products can work the same way. Templates, niche guides, or printables take effort once, then can sell in the background.\n\nHigh yield savings accounts or treasury funds are another sleeper. So you will not get rich, but getting paid for literally doing nothing is hard to beat.\n\nBig pattern I’ve noticed: the more boring it sounds, the more likely it is to actually be passive.",

Most people aim for $10k and quit in a month.\n\nTo hit $300/month \"passively\" (or semi-passively), you just need **Traffic + Affiliate Link**.\n\n**The Easiest Path right now:** Faceless TikTok/Shorts. You don't need to be an influencer.\n\n1. **Pick a niche:** (e.g., \"Gadgets,\" \"AI Tools,\" or \"Office Setup\").\n2. **The Math:** You need to sell **10 items** a month (at a $30 commission) to hit your $300 goal.\n3. **The Automation:** Don't edit manually (that's not passive). Use AI tools to generate the videos. I use **Keyvello** to auto-match stock footage to my scripts.\n\nIt takes maybe 20 mins a day to manage. Once the videos are up, they work for you 24/7. It's the most realistic way to hit that extra $300 without learning complex skills like SEO or coding.",

It’s not life-changing, but if you’re gonna be on your phone anyway, it’s kinda nice to earn free money for the stuff you do time to time anyways\n\ntheres a normal cashback option thats pretty common nowadays, but the games are pretty unique there. I know there are a bunch out there, but this was the most realest one out there ive seen so far\n\nYou can cash them out to your bank later or trade for gift cards,  \nminimum payout is $25 - but the games you play do pay more than those normal GPT apps (2-3 usd more in avg)\n\nif you are interested and sign up by my referral link, you get $5 headstart and if you can reach a certain quota you can stack that bonus once. and what do i get in return? same as you.\n\ni mostly use the money i get to fund some of my weird hobbies XD\n\nthank you so much!!\n\nPs: yes this is a referral link, its the only way to get the bonus\\^\\^\n\nEDIT: the ref link IS in the LP i created called pocketgrind.com. whenever i post raw link my acc dosent seem to allow comments and i think its due to CQS being low!! thank you for understanding\n\nand yes this benjamin app reff i truely should have mentioned! thats why i made the LP to where i mentioned everything",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nwanted to quickly share of what the last 3 months looked like after launching my first \"proper\" iOS app [Dayzen](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dayzen-visual-time-planner/id6754326173). I built one app before purely as a learning exercise and never tried to make money from it. This time I went all in on actually monetizing. Here's what happened.\n\n**The numbers (3 months in):**\n\n3,500 downloads\n\n$1,500 revenue\n\n1 pride-crushing Reddit roasting\n\nNot life-changing money, but considering I work a 9-5 in B2B, and this is a nights-and-weekends project.. I'll happily take it.\n\n**Lesson 1: People HATE subscriptions for utility apps (and they will tell you)**\n\nI launched with a subscription model because that's what every \"how to monetize your app\" blog tells you to do. Recurring revenue, LTV and all those nice things. What all the indiehacker blogs don't tell you is that regular people  (not SaaS buyers) genuinely *HATE* subscriptions for simple tools.\n\nI posted about my app on Reddit and got absolutely torched. Like, \"my ears were physically hot from embarrassment\" torched. Comments like \"another app wanting $5/month to show me a clock\" levels of brutal.\n\nBut they were right. A planning tool isn't Netflix. People want to pay once and own it. I switched to a lifetime purchase option and conversions improved almost immediately. The lesson: listen to the roasting. Sometimes the mob is correct.\n\n**Lesson 2: B2C marketing is a completely different beast**\n\nI spend my days selling to businesses. In B2B, you can target 50 accounts, write a good cold email, and land meetings. In B2C? You're screaming into a void of millions of people who don't care.\n\nThings that didn't work nearly as well as I expected: paid social ads. Things that worked way better than expected: genuinely participating in communities (ADHD subreddits, productivity forums) and letting the product speak for itself. The irony of B2C is that trying to \"market\" feels like marketing, and people smell it instantly. Being a real human who built something they actually use daily works 10x better.\n\n**Lesson 3: The minimalism vs. feature bloat tightrope is REAL**\n\nEvery week I get two types of feedback:\n\n\"This app needs \\[X feature\\] to be useful\" and \"I love how simple this is\"\n\nBoth people are right. Both people would be furious if I listened to the other one. Designing a consumer app that stays focused while growing is genuinely one of the hardest product challenges I've faced — and I do product for a living.\n\nMy rule now: if a feature serves the *core metaphor* (in my case, visualizing time as a finite container), it gets considered. If it's a \"nice to have\" that dilutes the core experience, it goes in the maybe-later pile. Most things go in the maybe-later pile.\n\n**Lesson 4: Privacy-first sounds great until you need to make decisions**\n\nI deliberately chose to collect zero user data. No analytics, no tracking, no accounts required. And users *love* this. It's one of the most praised things in reviews.\n\nBut here's the thing nobody tells you: when you don't collect data, your own product becomes a black box. I have no idea which features people actually use. I don't know where people drop off. I can't segment users by behavior. Every product decision is basically vibes and App Store reviews.\n\nIt's a trade-off I'd make again. I think it's the right thing to do but \"privacy-first\" has a real cost that the indie dev community romanticizes a bit too much. You're essentially flying blind.\n\n**Lesson 5: The first app you monetize teaches you more than 10 you don't**\n\nMy first app was a learning exercise. I learned Swift, I learned design, I learned shipping. But I learned *nothing* about pricing, positioning, conversion, or retention because there was no money on the line.\n\nThe moment real dollars are involved, your brain works differently. You start thinking about value perception, willingness to pay, trial-to-paid funnels. You read your 1-star reviews at 2am and actually think about what they mean. I wish I'd tried monetizing earlier, even badly.\n\n**What's next:**\n\nHonestly just keep going. $1.5k in 3 months won't pay my rent, but the trajectory feels right. The people who use the app daily are genuinely passionate about it, and that's the signal I'm chasing. I want to build the best visual planning experience on iOS and I think there's a real niche here for people who think in time-blocks rather than lists.\n\nHappy to answer any questions or share more specific numbers. And if you've launched a consumer app from a B2B background, I'd especially love to hear your experience  because I'm still very much figuring this out.\n\nJoris\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1qyl2mr/video/3xjmt022f4ig1/player\n\n",

Always hearing about passive income online, but every time I look into it, it's either super technical or requires a ton of upfront cash. \n\n\n\nI tried the whole Etsy digital products thing last year – spent weeks making printables, listed them, and... crickets. Maybe made $50 over three months? Not exactly life-changing. Or maybe I just suck at marketing, who knows. \n\n\n\nAnyway, I was scrolling through some forums the other day (probably should've been sleeping), and stumbled on this thing called Bradley Woods Affiliate Mentor. It's an AI-powered system that automates affiliate marketing, claims you only need a $25 one-time investment and it runs 24/7. Sounds almost too good to be true, right? Like, I'm skeptical as hell because I've been burned by 'get-rich-quick' stuff before. But part of me is curious – has anyone here actually tried something like this? Or know if it's legit? \n\n\n\nWait, actually, I think I'm getting ahead of myself. The real question is: what passive income ideas have you all found that are actually sustainable without turning into a second job? I'm talking about stuff that, after you set it up, you can mostly forget about. \n\n\n\nFor context, I'm a dad with two kids, so time is tight. No tech skills either, which doesn't help. \n\n\n\nSo yeah, what's worked for you? Dividend investing? Rental properties with a manager? Or any online systems that are truly hands-off? And if you've dabbled in automated affiliate stuff, I'd love to hear your take – good or bad.",

I had a task for Stellar AI about a year, but after getting approved to work on it, I didn't do it because I had so many other projects going on, and I think I got blacklisted. Appen/Crowdgen has been dead for like 6 months for me. I was approved for their Multimango, but it seems they lost it. Was approved for another project, but it only ever says tasks are not available. I am in Multimango for RWS, but am on hold during audit review... and the other task I am on in Alignerr is waiting for new data. I am passing the time with crappy Prolific surveys, but I feel like I need something else. I have applied to a few Mercor positions, Telus positions, and Oneforma never pays enough... any other suggestions? I am more of a generalist with rating/auditing/reviewing experience with transcriptions, audio, and visual. I have a biology degree, but honestly, it has been like 20 years since earning it, and I don't remember half of what I learned, though it does come in helpful as just having it allows me to do Pearson scoring in the spring.\n\nWhere else should I be looking?",

      "selftext": "**Note**: *Not promoting this side project - its not relevant for people, only the lessons are. I blurred the name and details out for this reason.*\n\n\\---\n\n3 years ago I built a simple site for college students looking for off-campus housing for a specific area. Put it up, ported the data from an old Excel sheet the students used, sent an email blast to the landlords on the Excel doc, and largely stopped working on it after 1 month. It currently makes about $1k/year from subscriptions, and I'm going to be adding minimal ads soon. I check on it maybe once a quarter or when someone emails me.\n\nWell, I get weekly emails from Google Search Console, and the stats, impressions, etc. just keep climbing. And now? **I'm ranking above Zillow for hundreds of specific address searches.**\n\nNot \"apartments for rent\" or \"houses in Connecticut\", but for queries like \"123 Example Road\" - where students, summer renters, buyers, etc. are googling specific houses near campus or in that area.\n\n# The numbers (last 3 months)\n\n|Metric|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Clicks from Google|1,387|\n|Impressions|17,879|\n|Average position|5.5|\n|Indexed pages|23 (going to add more)|\n\nFor address-specific searches, I'm often **position 2-4**. Zillow is below me. Sometimes I even beat [Realtor.com](http://Realtor.com) too.\n\nOne query specifically: \"919 &lt;REDACTED&gt; road\" - I rank #3, Zillow ranks #4. My CTR on that term is 24%.\n\n# Why does a tiny site beat a $7B company?\n\nZillow optimizes for \"apartments for rent in \\[city\\].\" They care about volume.\n\nI accidentally optimized for \"919 &lt;REDACTED&gt; Road\" - the exact thing a college junior types when they're deciding between two houses for senior year.\n\n**Giants optimize for scale. Niches get ignored.**\n\n# The playbook I stumbled into\n\n**1. Hyper-specific pages**\n\nI have a dedicated page for each paid listing with the exact address in the URL, title, and H1. Zillow buries the same info 2-3 clicks deep in a generic template.  Side note: The SEO alone is nearly worth the subscription costs for the landlords.\n\n**2. Intent matching**\n\nMy page says \"student rental\" and \"summer rental\" and shows what students and summer renters actually care about: bedrooms, distance to campus, landlord contact.\n\nZillow shows Zestimate, tax history, and mortgage calculators. Wrong intent entirely.\n\n**3. Long-tail by default**\n\nI never targeted \"&lt;CITY&gt; rentals\" (impossible to rank). I target things like \"&lt;X&gt; university beach houses\" - lower volume, zero competition, high intent.\n\n**4. Passive maintenance**\n\nLandlords update their own listings - I just keep the lights on. Total time spent per month: maybe 1 hour for specific requests, or editing/approving new listings.\n\n# This pattern works everywhere\n\nThe model isn't unique to housing. Any time there's a giant who doesn't care about a specific user segment, there's an opportunity:\n\n|Niche Site|Beats|Why It Works|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Local activity blogs (e.g., \"Things to do in Lake Winnipesaukee\")|TripAdvisor, Yelp|Hyper-local content, updated seasonally, ad revenue|\n|College-specific resources|Generic education sites|Students search \"\\[university name\\] + thing\" not \"college thing\"|\n|Hobby part suppliers|Amazon, eBay|\"1967 Omega Seamaster crown\" - Amazon doesn't index this|\n|Local service directories|Thumbtack, Angi|\"Best plumber in \\[small town\\]\" - nationals don't optimize for 5k population towns|\n\nThe common thread: **specificity beats scale when the user's intent is specific.**\n\n# What I'd do if starting today\n\n1. **Find a market where giants exist but don't care about your user**\n   * Zillow doesn't care about college students at specific addresses\n   * Booking.com doesn't care about dog-friendly cabins at one specific lake\n   * Amazon doesn't care about vintage watch parts\n2. **Build pages that match exact search intent**\n   * If someone searches an address, give them an address page\n   * If someone searches \"\\[school\\] housing,\" give them a school page\n3. **Let the content maintain itself**\n   * User-generated listings, community contributions, or scraping public data\n   * Your job is curation, not creation\n4. **Monetize through ads or affiliate**\n   * These sites don't need subscriptions\n   * Traffic + local ads = passive income\n   * My site makes \\~$1k/year on basically zero effort\n5. **Be patient**\n   * Keep your costs low - these things take time.\n\n**Monetize through subscriptions, local ads or affiliate**\n\n# Final Note\n\nAt this point, the SEO and potential local business ad revenue (e.g. $20-100/mo for side ad placements) likely exceeds the annual subscription value. Someone may very easily pay $5k+ to acquire the site.  It was extremely easy to set up, I posted a few bulletins on the schools Housing Board, and emailed everyone I knew who had a rental house. Many were quick to pay the $100/yr subscription - I probably can charge more.\n\n*Funny final anecdote*: *The mayor of a large city nearby has 2 paid listings on the site, so we are on a first name basis and I have his number and email - maybe it'll come in handy one day!*",

Most \"affiliate program lists\" are complete garbage - outdated, spammy, or pure SEO bait\n2. A shocking number of programs have terrible affiliate terms (7-day cookies, low commissions)\n3. The best programs are often hidden and not marketed well\n4. People desperately need a centralized resource for this\n\n**Current state:**\n\nLaunched a few days ago with lifetime access pricing.

      "selftext": "TL;DR: Two-thirds of Skimlinks programs have no click data. The median EPC is $0.14. Commission rate is the wrong thing to optimize - EPC is. Interactive report with full data in comments.\n\nI pulled every program on Skimlinks (\\~29k) and categorized against a clean set of verticals. Here's what stood out.\n\n**1. There are way more dead programs than you'd expect.**\n\nOf 28,844 programs listed, 19,191 (66.5%) have no click data - no EPC, no conversion rate, no basket size. They're in the directory, but there's no evidence clicks are converting.\n\nSome could be new listings or programs that are primarily active on other networks. But even if you're generous and assume a quarter of them are just new -that still means roughly half the catalog is dead weight. The actual pool of programs generating real earnings is far smaller than the directory makes it look.\n\n**2. Commission rate is the wrong way to pick programs. EPC is better (when you have it).**\n\nCommission rate is the vanity metric everyone chases. \"This program pays 12%!\" But it ignores basket size and conversion rate - the two things that actually determine what you earn per click.\n\nEPC (earnings per click) = commission rate × average basket size × conversion rate. It captures the full picture in one number.\n\nHere are the top 10 programs on the entire Skimlinks network by EPC:\n\n|Program|EPC|Commission|Avg Basket|CVR|What's driving it|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Akind DE|$15.41|12.4%|$361|34.5%|Monster CVR|\n|ZenBusiness|$12.40|37.1%|$227|14.7%|High commission × high CVR|\n|GuestReady|$9.25|5.0%|$633|29.2%|Huge basket × huge CVR|\n|RajaniMD|$9.10|15.9%|$184|31.2%|High commission × monster CVR|\n|Ivim Health|$7.94|21.4%|$524|7.1%|Big basket × high commission|\n|Misha and Puff|$7.35|20.0%|$300|12.3%|Premium pricing × solid CVR|\n|smava|$7.33|1.5%|$20,628|2.4%|$20k basket - commission is irrelevant|\n|Cloud Water Filters|$6.64|58.2%|$354|3.2%|Extreme commission|\n|WECREAT TECH|$6.19|8.0%|$1,168|6.6%|$1k+ basket does the work|\n|Beeksebergen|$4.85|6.6%|$684|10.8%|Holiday rental - big basket × solid CVR|\n\nNot one of these would rank near the top if you sorted by commission rate alone. smava pays 1.5% commission and earns $7.33 per click because the average order is $20,000. GuestReady pays 5% and earns $9.25 because people book $633 stays and convert at 29%.\n\nThere are really only two equations that produce high EPC:\n\n**Big basket × modest commission** \\- travel, accommodation, finance, high-ticket goods. You don't need a high commission when someone books a $1,700 hotel stay at 5%.\n\n**High commission × high CVR** \\- health, business, education. Smaller baskets but 10–30% conversion rates. Volume compensates.\n\nThe trap is picking programs with moderate everything. Decent commission, average basket, average CVR. That's where most programs live and it's where EPC goes to die.\n\n**3. These patterns hold across every vertical.**\n\nI classified all 9,323 programs with EPC data into 21 verticals (using cross-network data from CJ, Impact, FlexOffers, and Awin to fix Skimlinks' messy categorization). The same two paths show up at the category level:\n\n|Vertical|Programs|Avg EPC|Avg Basket|CVR|Commission|What's working|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Finance &amp; Insurance|58|$0.66|$1,277|5.0%|12.2%|Big basket|\n|Jewellery|136|$0.43|$383|3.5%|8.4%|Big basket|\n|Travel &amp; Accommodation|444|$0.40|$612|3.5%|6.4%|Big basket|\n|Health &amp; Wellness|646|$0.35|$100|5.4%|10.6%|High CVR|\n|Sports &amp; Outdoors|404|$0.34|$217|4.6%|6.6%|Balanced|\n|...|||||||\n|Software &amp; Technology|142|$0.22|$69|2.1%|31.6%|Nothing - CVR kills it|\n\n(6 of 21 verticals. Full breakdown in the interactive report.)\n\nFinance earns $0.66/click on a $1,277 basket at just 12.2% commission. Software has the highest commission rate of any vertical (31.6%) and the lowest EPC ($0.22) because almost nobody converts (2.1% CVR).\n\n**4. The EPC distribution is brutal.**\n\nOf the 9,356 programs with a measurable EPC:\n\n* 46% earn less than $0.10 per click\n* The median is $0.14\n* Only 5.7% break $1.00\n* Just 9 programs in the entire network exceed $5.00\n\nThe distribution is massively right-skewed. Most programs cluster between $0.01 and $0.25. If you're picking programs without checking EPC, you're almost certainly landing in that pile.\n\n**5. The one thing to take from this:**\n\nSort by EPC, not commission rate. If a network doesn't show you EPC, calculate it from basket size and conversion rate. If they don't show you those either, that's a red flag in itself.\n\nThe interactive report has the full vertical breakdown with reversal rates, the top 20 programs ranked by EPC, EPC distribution charts, and a commission-vs-EPC scatter plot; below.\n\nThis is one network. I'm building the same analysis across CJ, Impact, ShareASale, Rakuten, Awin, and others - a free directory that surfaces EPC, basket size, conversion rates, reversal rates, and commission structures across 50,000+ listings. More on that in comments.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the data or methodology.\n\n*Data: 28,844 programs on Skimlinks, 9,356 with non-zero EPC. Vertical classification used cross-network category matching against CJ, FlexOffers, Impact, Awin, and others, with Skimlinks categories and manual review as fallback. All 9,323 programs with EPC data classified across 21 verticals. EPC/basket/CVR averages use non-zero values only. Full methodology in the interactive report.*",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been building a small project for a while, and it actually started getting organic traffic recently (Google + some direct traffic), which honestly surprised me.\n\nIt’s a niche **website submission/directory type site** where people can submit their websites into categories and browse others. Think old-school directories, but cleaner and searchable.\n\nThe issue is that I have traffic but no **revenue** right now.\n\nI don’t really want to use AdSense.  \nNot because of earnings only, but because:  \n• approval is annoying  \n• I’ve seen accounts randomly banned  \n• Ads don’t match directory users very well  \n• It makes the site look spammy\n\nWhat I’m trying to find is something more “integrated”.\n\nWhat I mean:  \nIdeally, I’d like a monetisation method where I can **add a code/script to my site** that automatically displays relevant content (listings, offers, tools, widgets, etc.) instead of traditional banner ads.\n\nBasically:  \nnot popups  \nnot gambling ads  \nnot shady downloads\n\nMore like:  \n— contextual marketplace  \n— sponsored listings  \n— useful widgets  \n— something that fits a directory\n\nI already thought about:  \n• paid submissions  \n• featured listings\n\nBut I feel I’m missing something smarter that other directory owners use.\n\nSo my question to people who run sites:  \n**What monetisation methods actually worked for you on informational or directory websites that are NOT AdSense?**\n\nEspecially if it’s something that can be installed via a code snippet or a widget.\n\nI’m open to anything — affiliate networks, APIs, widgets, SaaS partnerships, etc.\n\nWould really appreciate real experiences rather than theory.\n\nThanks 🙏",

Got great at it. Raised money. Then realized I had no idea how to sell the actual product to actual customers because I had never studied them with the same intensity.\n\nThe investor pitch is a one-time performance. Customer conversations happen every single day and they compound. Every customer call you walk into unprepared is revenue you left on the table.\n\nWhat I do now before every important customer call: I pull their LinkedIn, their company blog, their recent job postings (tells you what they are investing in), their Glassdoor reviews (tells you what is broken internally), and any podcast appearances. Feed it to Claude and ask it to roleplay as this person pushing back on my product.\n\nThe job postings thing is the real cheat code nobody talks about. If a company is hiring for a role related to what you sell, they have already decided to invest in solving that problem. You are not convincing them they have a problem. You are convincing them your solution is better than hiring someone.\n\nOne customer call where I did this prep resulted in a 6-figure annual contract. They literally said \"it feels like you understand our business better than most people who work here.\" I did. Because I spent 2 hours studying them like they were a final exam.\n\nThe meta lesson: preparation is the most underrated competitive advantage in business. Most people wing it. The ones who don't, win disproportionately.",

      "selftext": "So in 1347 rats hitched rides on merchant ships and brought the plague to Europe. Nobody noticed til it was too late because the rats looked like they belonged there.\n\nThat’s literally what’s happening to the internet right now. Bots everywhere, on every platform, and you can’t tell anymore because they all sound like that one overachieving kid in class who read the textbook twice.\n\nMedieval doctors wore bird masks and prescribed leeches. We have AI detection tools that are wrong half the time. Same energy honestly.\n\nThe plague ended when the rats ran out of people to infect. This one ends when AI runs out of human content to train on and starts eating its own output. We’re watching the internet develop mad cow disease in real time.",

      "selftext": "I quit my job as Head of Growth at a fintech to build my own thing. Had savings, had a co-founder, had what I thought was a great idea. So we went dark for 8 months and built.\n\nNo blog. No social media. No talking to potential customers. Just heads down building because I was convinced someone would steal the idea if we talked about it. Looking back thats embarrassing to admit but at the time it felt like strategy.\n\nWe launched to nothing. Not criticism. Not rejection. Just silence. The kind of silence where you refresh your analytics dashboard 40 times a day and the number stays at zero. My co-founder and I sat in a coffee shop the day after launch staring at each other like \"now what.\"\n\nThe product wasnt bad. We actually got decent feedback from the few people who tried it. The problem was that nobody knew we existed and we had zero relationships with the people we were building for. Eight months of building and we hadnt talked to a single potential customer.\n\nHeres what I do completely differently now:\n\nI dont build anything until Ive talked to at least 30 people who have the problem Im trying to solve. Not surveys. Actual conversations. Most of them will tell you things that make you uncomfortable. Thats the point.\n\nI build in public now. Not in the cringey \"day 47 of my startup journey\" way. But I talk about what Im working on, what problems Im seeing, what Im learning. The people who engage with that become your first users.\n\nI stopped being precious about the idea. Nobody is going to steal your startup idea. Execution is everything and most people cant even execute on their own ideas let alone yours.\n\nThe stealth mode thing felt like strategy but it was actually fear. I was afraid of putting something imperfect out there. I was afraid of hearing that maybe the thing I was building didnt matter. Stealth mode is just expensive procrastination disguised as strategy.\n\nIf you are reading this and you are currently in stealth mode, stop. Go talk to 10 people this week about what you are building. The discomfort you feel doing that is the exact work you are avoiding.",

This time I talked to 50 potential customers before writing a single line of code. Within 6 weeks I had my first paying user. The difference wasnt talent or timing. It was that I finally had the maturity to do the uncomfortable thing first instead of hiding behind the fun stuff.\n\nThe honest truth about starting at 35: your biggest enemy isnt age. Its the voice in your head that says you should have figured this out by now. That voice is lying. Most successful founders I know started their winning company after 30. The ones who started younger just failed more times before they found the thing that worked.\n\nYou have maybe 30+ working years ahead of you. That is an absurd amount of time. Start now and stop comparing your beginning to someone elses middle.",

It really is a journey, not a destination. There's no biological clock ticking here.\n\nYou have to understand with business.You must bring value to the marketplace.Because it doesn't give a shit about your wants or needs.It will only reward value if you survive.\n\nThere's a reason most successful business owners are in their forties.\n\nYou're a baby on the timeline.\n\nDisregard the do what you're passionate about bullshit.\nDon't look for shortcuts.Because the secret is buried in the work that everyone's trying to avoid always take the hard path. It pays the best in the long run.\n\nHere's what you need.\n\nSkills \nKnowledge \nExperience \nCharacter \nTime\n\nThe good news is, you can get all of those things from just about any job in the world. Even multiple jobs if you bounce around. Any job that can make payroll consistently is further ahead than most small businesses. They've already survived the cut.\n\nI recommend sales. Even if and even if you're an introvert like me.And if you suck at it, because you suck at everything you start at. Anyone can do it. There's also no limit on how much you can make or learn or grow.\n\nWhatever job you get, whatever industry you work in.Because you have to pay your bills. You're gonna spend more time there than you will with those that you love or the things that you love.That's life it's unfair and nobody's coming to save you.\n\nSo be the best at your job, even if it means you're not getting paid for it be better than that. I treated every job like I owned the company. Then, when you're not at work, work harder on yourself than you do your job.\n\nYou have to understand to run a business in the early years.You're doing everything by yourself.With no capital and very little time. You need to be able to do the sales, the order fulfillment, the purchasing, the marketing, the managing, the finances and quickbooks, and the hiring and firing.\n\nLearn every one of those roles at whatever company you're at, by just being curious, which is a skill set.And helpful. The people that are employed that say, well, that's not my job.Or I don't get paid enough to do that.Those are the unhelpful fucking people and they don't learn shit.\n\nDon't be that guy.\n\nSpend ten years building you while paying your bills. Listen to biographies on founder's podcast, all of them over and over again. You will learn so much more at different times of your life.From biographies than you will from any other business book that i've read.And i've got a fucking library like literally a library, and we're building a library in the town we live in so two fucking libraries. Personal and public because when you make a shitload of money, you should build libraries.\n\nBuild your skills.\nQuickbooks is definitely top of the list on financial tools. When you get a couple paychecks, buy an old desktop version and create a fake company with fake vendors. Fake customers fake invoices, fake bank accounts fake credit cards, fake purchasing fake, receiving and play business in that sandbox until you master quickbooks. When you get hung up on something, go online and look at youtube. OR work on your networking and social engineering skills and make friends with the people that are in the accounting department, payroll department accounts, receivable, payable department at your job and ask them, hey, my wife and I are hung up on this with our quick books.How would you get through this?\n\nPeople love to help when it's something they're good at.\n\nVolunteer some hours late at night, or on the weekend to help the warehouse.Get orders out when they're busier to do inventory at the job that you work. Help I t set up new computers and monitors for the new salespeople or whatever when you get a chance. Don't count the cost.\n\nStudy, whatever industry you're in, find out who the top five players are.And see what they do to come to market differently from the company.That you're in currently. Why do they do it? How did the company work for start? Who is the first person that got hired?And why? Learn everything about the supply chains and the distribution chains and the channels to market and the customers themselves.\n\nAll of these things will paint a picture for you.And you will understand where you're at better than anyone around you.That's just punching a clock doing their job.Because you're not paid to do all that extra shit.\n\nOver the years, you're gonna build up undeniable skill, sets experiences and knowledge.And your character's gonna develop, because character's not just being honest.I'm a good guy.I've got good character, no, it's resilience.It's fortitude, it's perseverance.It's living outside your comfort zone to where you can't even see the fucking boundary.Because it's so far away and you're so uncomfortable.But that's where you grow.That's the gift!\n\nOver time years for me, it was decades. You'll start to see things and question em and dig and research further.And then bring them to the owners of the company and say, what if we did this differently like this. Don't bring it to him until you have a plan.As if you were gonna bring it to market that day. They're gonna tell you someone older, smarter.Wiser, more educated, more experienced would have done it.If it was possible or even the arrogant owner themselves will tell you they would have done it. But if you've proven yourself as undeniably valuable at your job, they're gonna say, if you want to mess with that, go ahead, mess with it.In your free time.\n\nHere's where you get to build more experience. You get to bring something to market and you won't get credit for it.And you won't get paid for it.In most cases, you'll make a company a lot of money.And you'll just get screwed.\n\nBut they can't take the skills or the knowledge or the experience or the character that you get to build in that process away from you.\n\nYour character is a soft component.It's your personal value.\n\nYou can't find something if you don't already have it. You must find something of value and bring it to the marketplace.But first you have to become valuable.\n\nThis is what i've done.And it's worked every time. It's not the short path. It's not the easiest path. But anyone can do it. When you get further down the path, you can reply to me and I'll help you with the how too's.\n\nIt's worth it.",

Most people do not start with a clear business idea that feels meant for them, that usually comes after doing something boring or messy first. The internet makes it look like everyone woke up with a genius concept, but in reality most ideas are discovered through action, not thinking.\n\nGiven your situation, unemployed, low capital, not technical, working from home, you are actually in a good spot for service based things rather than products or SaaS. Services look unsexy but they teach you sales, communication, and problem solving fast, and those skills transfer to almost any business later. You do not need to love the idea, you just need to tolerate it enough to learn from it.\n\nThe trap you want to avoid is waiting for clarity before starting. Clarity usually shows up after you have tried a few things and failed a bit. Pick something small, cheap, and reversible, give it a few months, and see what you learn. Even if it does not work, it will make the next idea much clearer.\n\nNot knowing what you want to build yet does not mean you are behind.

Should I do job? Should I do my own business? And then after that, when I decided I will do my own job, then what kind of job, what kind of business, what kind of products? I mean, I was always confused because the main reason was what I noticed in like seven to eight years when I was struggling with these kind of things, I was struggling with my own thoughts. I noticed I was comparing with myself with others' people and thinking that I am a slow person. I'm thinking that I do not have the capability to do something. Okay, instead I have to do, I have to work on my skill.\n\nI was just noticing others' people's stories, just like you are doing right now. So that pattern, I also had that time. So it is called a validation, you can say. Taking validation from external. And this happens when, when you don't know your own voice, when you don't know what is your belief.

If I am comparing with other people. Even though I know the whole thing that, okay, social media is fake, still, still my belief are not trusting that thoughts. They believe that, yes, I am slow or not doing anything because of reality because your are not doing anything that's why you think alot.. okay. \n\nSo I was always talking negative about myself because I was comparing, I was taking validation. I was not sure what to do i had no comfidnce, I wanted to do something, but not for me that time. I wanted to do something for the world, for other people to show, show up, you can say. So I was not even honest with myself. Right now, what ever I'm sharing, I faced my honesty, truth. I set with my ugly thoughts after seven to eight years, I got to realize that these are the patterns and the root cause was different.\n\nThe root cause was just one thing. And that was... I just have to believe myself. I just do not have to show everyone. I just do not have to prove anyone. I don't have to prove anyone in this world. I just have to be with myself and just try to figure out the root cause of what's I'm dealing with it. Because it's not about the business or anything. It's about what's going on in your world. What's the thing that affected that you are believing like this? \n\nWhat do you adapt in your circumstance that you are talking negative about yourself? I mean, there are lots of things that I wanted to share with you, but that's the pattern I noticed. The main thing is, I would say that stop taking validation it will be hard at first and I would just suggest you recommend one thing. Just sit in silence with yourself  I mean, no phone, no nothing. I would also  suggest you go for lak . Just go for a walk in the park and just notice around, what people are doing. And just do walk at least 10 to 15 minutes. And whatever the thoughts coming in your mind, maybe related to your business or anything, you will get the answer. Just do it for at least 7 days and you will maybe get the idea that you are looking right now.",

Tons of legit businesses start from a bedroom with zero paperwork at the beginning. Product vs service: services are usually easier when you’re broke and inexperienced. Product businesses are harder, slower, and riskier early on. You don’t need to be an expert yet.

You've already answered that elsewhere (Actually, before even asking the PvS question) by telling us about your lack of resources. If you lack resources, then service is THE way to go, at least initially. Nothing you do is ever set in stone, so you can pivot into production later, when you have the resources to do so. \n\nYou mentioned business consulting or PR. Those are tough to sell at your age without a proven track record. Look for \"doing\" services instead of \"advising\" services. Can you manage social media? Can you write copy? Can you edit short-form video? Can you handle basic administrative tasks for a local business?\n\nHere's what I'd do to start (Remember, this is just advice, not THE way to go) Pick one boring service, find one person who needs it, and try to make $100 or equivelant. Once you do that, the \"cloud\" of ideas usually starts to clear because you're actually in the game instead of watching from the sidelines. Have you ever heard that it's easier to find a job when you already have one? The same applies here, once you're actually IN THERE doing SOMETHING, no matter how small, you'll find more oppurtunities.\n\nThe very best advice I can give... NEVER be afraid to fail.",

What you’re describing isn’t laziness or failure it’s what happens when multiple things collapse at once: layoffs, a brutal job market, bias, and rising costs. That combination breaks even very capable people.\n\nA lot of people don’t realize how bad things are right now. Many jobs are posted without real intent to hire, freelance work is oversaturated, and ghosting has become normal. On top of that, bias against people from certain regions is real, even if no one says it out loud. None of that reflects your skills or work ethic.\n\nYou’re also not “begging” for work you’re trying to survive. There’s no shame in that. The problem isn’t that you’re asking; it’s that desperation in a broken market often goes unanswered, no matter how qualified someone is.\n\nOne thing that might help is narrowing your offer drastically. Instead of “we do digital marketing, social media, automation,” try one very specific outcome for one specific type of client. Broad services feel risky to clients right now; narrow, concrete help feels safer.\n\nIf you need to take temporary, underpaid, or unpleasant work just to keep the lights on, that doesn’t mean you’ve failed it means you’re buying time. Survival comes before pride. This season does not define you.\n\nLastly, please don’t internalize the judgment from others. People who haven’t been here often believe hardship only happens to those who “did something wrong.” That belief protects them emotionally, but it isn’t true.\n\nYou’re not broken. You’re exhausted, under pressure, and navigating a system that’s failing a lot of people quietly. Keep going one step at a time, and if possible, accept help without shame when it’s offered.

It sounds like bad timing mixed with a tough market and a lot of pressure all at once.\n\nOne honest thing that might be hurting you right now is offering too many services at once. When people are scared to spend, “digital marketing + social + automation” feels vague to buyers, even if the skills are real. They usually trust one very specific outcome more than a general offer.\n\n  \nA few practical resets that might help, not quick fixes but clearer steps:\n\n\\- Try selling one small, very specific result instead of services. Something boring but concrete.\n\n\\- Avoid monthly retainers for now. They are hard to close when trust is low. One-time, fixed work is easier.\n\n\\- Show your thinking publicly before asking for money. Short Loom audits, breakdowns, examples of how you’d approach a problem.\n\n\\- Taking underpaid or survival work right now is not a failure. It’s just getting through a hard phase.  \n\n\nAbout “begging for work”, asking for work is not begging. It only feels like begging when the offer isn’t clear, both to you and to the buyer.\n\nYou don’t sound incapable or dishonest. You sound stuck in a market that is brutal to generalists right now. Narrowing what you sell and who you sell it to usually brings back some control.\n\nI really hope things stabilize for you soon. What you’re dealing with is harder than most people online admit.",

Wishing you the best and hope things get better for you soon.\n\nI've utilised marketing contractors and agencies from all over the world during my 10 years or so doing this, both solo and on behalf of clients. Here are some things that I think would help you:\n\n- Website, make one. Seriously. I won't hire any freelancers without a portfolio or website. Even an Upwork profile with some portfolio pieces and feedback, or a simple Wix with some links will do. If I can't see evidence of some work somewhere, I don't trust you - this rule applies to anyone I screen regardless of location.\n\n- I sell a lot of services, but I pitch one thing as an opener. For example, first website I made started as a graphic design and content creation project, first PR retainer started with a website copy overhaul, first strategy consultation as copywriting etc. \n\n- As such, don't pitch for retainers, do one project really well, then open up subtly about other services. I learnt this selling for marketing agencies before I went solo. You need to prove trust as a small company with some wins before the client invests. Pick the 3 things you're best at and proven in as your opener.\n\n- Niche down in industry. I offer a lot of services through my own skills and subcontractors, but I'm in a tech niche that I have a network and 10+ years experience in. If you don't have one, find something underserved with less competition. No one wants general services anymore, you either specialise in a few or run lots in specific verticals like luxury, D2C, local businesses, AI, games, telecoms, SaaS etc\n\n- You're understandably scared and I can read it in your text, no offense. Potential clients smell fear a mile away. It's a confidence game. Find something, even part-time or low paid, to keep you afloat. Building a business is very hard with no safety net - been there many times in my career and it sucks. Truly. \n\nBusiness always improved, ironically, when I felt good in of myself and sometimes when I was doing a low-paid job and felt some financial relief. Get some rest, make some time for hobbies, animals and friends, you're both working hard and deserve it 💜",

But I want to share something that might help reframe what's happening.\n\nI went through a period where I couldn't land a single client for 4 months. Not because I was bad at what I did, but because I was selling the wrong thing to the wrong people in the wrong way. I kept pitching \"digital marketing services\" which is what every freelancer on the planet offers. There was nothing for a prospect to grab onto.\n\nWhat changed everything was getting brutally specific. Instead of \"we do digital marketing,\" I started saying \"I'll set up your abandoned cart email sequence and you'll recover 5-15% of lost sales within 2 weeks.\" Same skills. Same me. Completely different response rate.\n\nThe painful truth about service businesses is that \"a range of services from digital marketing social media to automation\" sounds like everything and nothing at the same time. When a client reads that, they think \"this person does a bit of everything\" which translates to \"this person isn't the expert I need for my specific problem.\"\n\nPick the ONE thing you're best at. Not the 5 things you can do. The ONE thing. Then find the specific type of business that desperately needs that one thing and can't do it themselves.\n\nAlso - and I say this with zero judgment because I've been there - when you're desperate, prospects can feel it. It changes the energy of every interaction. The meetings where I finally closed were the ones where I genuinely stopped caring whether they said yes because I'd accepted that I'd survive either way. That mental shift is almost impossible to fake but it's the difference between \"please hire us\" energy and \"here's what I can do for you, take it or leave it\" energy.\n\nYou're not failing because you're from Africa or because you lack skills. You're failing because the positioning is too broad and the desperation is leaking through. Both of those are fixable.",

Nobody tweets about building inventory management software for auto parts distributors. Its not sexy. It will never go viral. And thats exactly why competition is low.\n\n2. The customers are easy to find. They are literally posting job ads for roles that exist only to manage these manual processes.

Once a company builds their workflow around your tool they will not switch for years. Thats recurring revenue with almost zero churn.\n\n4. You dont need venture capital. These businesses can be profitable from month one because you are replacing a salary not competing for attention.\n\nThe unsexy truth is that the best tech businesses solve problems that are too boring for most developers to care about.

Here are the ones that we mostly use today:\n\n* Windsurf Cascade/Cursor: Our engineering team mostly uses Winsurfs's cascade agent running on top of Claude Opus for almost everything! I think most of our engineers now claim they haven't really written a line of code manually in the last 3 months! They have kinda turned into product managers who guide the AI agent over actually programmers! Has resulted in our engineering output doubling easily!\n* Sierra: We have been using Sierra (I think Intercom fin is an alternative) which has helped reduce our support ticket load by about 30% but auto resolving questions that doesn't need a human intervention. For example, questions about things that are already documented on our website, already answered previously etc! It can also basically connect with CRMs, Stripe etc to pull up details for them automatically!\n* Frizerly: Their AI agent can learn all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog on our website every day! We usually let is publish as a draft and manually switch it to published after a quick review! \n* Otter: We have been using Otters Ai agent to automatically transcribe, summarize create action items, update CRMs etc after every customer and internal call. Basically this has allowed us to build a single repository of all customer conversations in Notion automatically as well! This was a huge pain point for our sales team earlier\n* Clay: We have taught Clay our ideal customer personal using previous conversions. Now it can automatically reach out on both email and LinkedIn to schedule our first sales calls for our sales team. Saves a lot of time for everyone. Conversion rate for the automation is same as manual outreach at this point. \n\nCurious what others are using :)",

Great for strategy work.\n\n📋 Outreach &amp; follow-up agents : they draft personalized outreach, reminders, and sequences based on brief inputs rather than manual writing.\n\n🧠 Knowledge assistants : manage internal docs, product specs, meeting notes, and make them searchable via natural language.\n\n🪄 Content co-creation agents: help turn an idea into a structure, then into actionable drafts (not just fluff). The best ones give you *framework + context*, not just words.\n\n🤖 Workflow orchestrators:  agents that can chain tasks (e.g., scan email → summarize → propose actions → send replies) are still emerging, but super powerful when configured right.\n\nFor many teams, the ROI isn’t a single tool:  it’s how you *embed* an agent into a real workflow (e.g., weekly competitor summary + task suggestions, or automated status updates).\n\nCurious: what’s the biggest bott your team wants to remove first :  research, writing, communication, or execution?\n\n",

Like marketing teams need different prompts/agents than finance or ops. If you're not already doing department-specific use cases, that's where the magic happens.\n\nAlso curious - are you setting up any custom GPTs or API integrations for their specific workflows?

Batch it - maybe 50-100 per session with different skill levels. The \"beginner trying to learn Claude\" and \"power user wanting advanced prompting\" should NOT be in the same room.\n\nFulfillment trick: Record everything. Seriously. Your 5-day training becomes 50+ hours of reference material they can revisit. Also helps with the people who miss sessions.\n\nPost-training support: Set expectations upfront. Maybe 30 days of Slack/email support, then transition to monthly check-ins. Don't let it become \"lifetime tech support\" - learned that the hard way.\n\nThe fear is normal - I remember my first 200+ person training feeling like I was going to throw up. But here's the thing: they hired YOU because you know this stuff better than they do. You're not imposing on them, you're solving their problem.\n\nAlso: charge for the scale complexity, not just the headcount. 1,000 people isn't 20x harder than 50 - it's 50x harder.\n\nYou got this.

Survived every framework war, every paradigm shift, every \"X is dead\" prediction.\n\nBut this one feels different.\n\nI spent my entire career getting good at something that's being commoditized in real time. The thing that used to take me weeks - someone with zero experience and an AI tool can ship a version of it in a weekend. Not a great version, but good enough to get users. Good enough to compete.\n\nAnd here's the timing irony: after two decades of building other people's products, I finally decided to go out on my own. Build something for myself. Be the founder, not the contractor.\n\nExcept now I'm launching into a market where the barrier to entry basically disappeared overnight. Every niche I research already has 15 AI-generated competitors. Every idea I validate has someone who shipped it last week using cursor and a vibe. The moat I spent 22 years building - deep technical expertise - is getting shallower by the month.\n\nThe fear is real. Not \"oh no AI will take my job\" fear. More like \"I waited too long and the game changed while I was warming up\" fear.\n\nWhat I'm learning (slowly) is that the 22 years aren't worthless - they're just worth something different now. Knowing what NOT to build is more valuable than being able to build anything. Understanding why systems fail matters more when everyone can make them work on demo day. And the experience of shipping real products to real users with real money on the line... that doesn't come from a weekend hackathon.\n\nBut I'd be lying if I said the doubt doesn't hit at 2am.\n\nAnyone else making the jump from senior dev to founder in this weird era?

They're completely different things. Building a company is a marathon. Nobody trains for a marathon by running every single day until their knees give out. You train smart, you rest on purpose, and you show up fresh when it counts. The guilt comes from thinking rest is the opposite of work, but it's actually part of the work.\n\nHere's what actually shifted things for me: I stopped treating rest as \"not working\" and started treating it as a responsibility. Your business needs you thinking clearly, not running on fumes making bad calls. I've made some of my worst decisions (wrong product decisions, misread documents) during stretches where I was \"grinding\" on 5 hours of sleep and zero downtime. Those mistakes cost way more than a Tuesday off ever would.\n\nThe guilt probably won't disappear entirely.

          "body": "The guilt is real and it's one of the hardest parts of running your own business. Here's what finally helped me reframe it:\n\nYour business needs you to make good decisions more than it needs you to be constantly busy. And good decision-making requires a brain that isn't fried. When you're burned out, you're not actually being productive - you're just present. There's a huge difference.\n\nI started treating rest days like business investments. Would I skip maintaining equipment because I'm too busy using it? No, because it would break. Your brain is your primary business tool.\n\nWhat worked for me:\n\n1. Schedule days off in advance, not when you're already exhausted. Put them on the calendar like client meetings. It's easier to take a day off when it's planned than when you wake up and decide that day.\n\n2. Define what a good rest day looks like FOR YOU. For me, it's not lying on the couch feeling guilty. It's doing something active that's not work - hiking, reading, building something with my hands. The physical activity actually helps more than passive rest.\n\n3. Track your output before and after rest days. I noticed my best work weeks almost always came after I took a real day off. The quality of thinking was just better.\n\n4. Remember that your competitors burning themselves out isn't an advantage for them - it's a vulnerability. The business that can sustain its pace wins, not the one that sprints until it collapses.\n\nThe restless feeling during time off? That fades once you prove to yourself that taking breaks doesn't derail everything. The first few times are the hardest.",

If it breaks while you’re gone, you just found a bug you need to fix.\n\nStop viewing rest as laziness and start viewing it as necessary maintenance for the Founder.

      "selftext": "Three of us started this company 18 months ago. Me, my buddy from college, and his wife. We run a social media content agency for DTC brands. Split equity equally because we all brought different skills. She handles creative direction and client communication. He does strategy and ops. I manage finances and new business.\n\nHit $18K/month last quarter. We have six retainer clients. The work is good and the timing feels right. Brands are desperate for consistent content and we deliver.\n\nExcept when we don't.\n\nAbout two months ago I started noticing something. When they have small arguments work just slows down. She'll be short in client calls or take longer to turn around revisions. Annoying but manageable.\n\nBut when they have a real fight she vanishes. No Slack response. Misses client meetings. Phone goes straight to voicemail. First time it happened I thought maybe she was sick. Covered a client presentation myself. She came back three days later like nothing happened.\n\nIt's happened four times now. Last one was six days. We had a major deliverable due for our biggest client and she just went dark. I ended up hiring a freelancer off Upwork at the last minute and staying up until 4am to art direct because I don't have her eye for this stuff. Client never knew but we barely made it.\n\nHe won't talk about it. Last time I brought it up he said she just needs to process things her own way and then changed the subject. I've tried asking if we should bring on someone to help with her workload and he gets defensive. Says I'm overreacting.\n\nI'm not overreacting. I'm watching my income depend on whether two people are getting along that week.\n\nWe're profitable and actually have a waitlist. The market is good right now. I don't want to walk away from something that's working.\n\nBut I can't keep doing this either. I've tried building backup systems. Looked at content generation tools like Midjourney, APOB, bunch of others. Doesn't work because clients hire us for a specific aesthetic. I've tried keeping freelancers on standby but that gets expensive and they don't know our clients like she does.\n\nEvery time my phone is quiet for more than a few hours I get this knot in my stomach. Is she just busy or is this another one? Should I cancel my plans this weekend just in case?\n\nTwo weeks ago I was sitting in my car after a client call and drafted a message about buyout options. Sat there staring at it for like twenty minutes. Deleted it. What if I'm bailing right before they figure it out? What if I'm the guy who gave up on something good because of a few rough months?\n\nBut also what if it gets worse and she disappears during something we actually can't recover from?\n\nSome days I think the revenue is worth it. Other days I just want out. And I have zero say in which version of them shows up to work.\n\nHas anyone stayed in a partnership that was making money but felt completely unstable?",

You don't need to mention anything about how she disappears or her work quality drops after their fights. You can bring up specific times when she went dark and you had to scramble to finish your deliverables, and ask if she needs support to make sure things don't fall off her radar. Alternatively, next time she drops the ball let her husband figure it out. As the finance and new biz guy you should not be responsible for communicating about BAU tasks with existing clients or covering for her. \n\nIf none of the above works, I'd think about exiting and looking for new cofounders that you can work with.",

It's a business risk you need to contain.\n\nYou have a profitable company with a single point of failure that disappears unpredictably. Replace the word \"co-founder's wife\" with \"critical vendor\" and you'd already have a backup plan in place. The fact that it's personal is exactly why you don't have one yet.\n\nSome things to think about:\n\nThe 33/33/33 equity split was a mistake but it's done. What you can still fix is the operating agreement. If there isn't one that defines what happens when a partner stops performing, that's the first conversation. Not about her specifically. About all three of you. What are the expectations, what happens when someone can't deliver, what's the exit mechanism.\n\nThe freelancer-at-4am thing you did? That's not dedication. That's a company running on adrenaline instead of structure. If her role is that critical then the business needs redundancy for that role regardless of who fills it. Document her processes, build a style guide detailed enough that a freelancer can match 80% of her output without you art directing at 4am.\n\nAnd the hardest part: you need to have the conversation with your buddy. Not about his marriage. About the business. \"When any partner is unavailable for 6 days with no communication, we need a protocol for that.\" Make it about the company, not about her.\n\n$18k/month with a waitlist is a real business.

A married couple holds 66% of your company. Even if your buddy is reasonable now, if things escalate between them (separation, divorce), you could get dragged into a legal mess with zero control.

Not a template from the internet. You need clauses that address minimum performance standards, what happens during extended absences, and buyout triggers. If you already have one, check if it covers any of this.\n\n  \n2. Frame the conversation around protecting the business, not blaming her. Something like \"we are growing, we have a waitlist, and we need a plan for when any one of us is unavailable for any reason.\" Make it about all three of you, not just her.\n\n  \n3. Propose a backup creative person on retainer now, while things are calm. Position it as scaling up to handle the waitlist, not as replacing her. If she pushes back on that, that tells you something important.\n\n  \n4. Stop deleting those buyout messages. Save them as drafts. Talk to a lawyer about what a structured buyout or equity restructure would look like so you have real numbers instead of anxiety spirals in your car.\n\n  \nThe fact that you are profitable with a waitlist means you have leverage right now.

Always plan for and pay the required taxes.\n* Operations and Systems: This is how the daily work gets done and good processes and operations can be the difference between unpredictable problems and out of your control.\n   * SOPs are the documented steps to do any business.\n   * Supply chain is the raw materials or tools needed.\n   * Quality control is critical as poor products or services will mean unhappy customers, bad reviews, and the business failing.\n* Marketing and Sales: How the business will become known and gain customers.\n   * Marketing is building awareness of the business.\n   * Sales is the process of converting someone interested into a paying customer.\n   * Customer retention is the methods by which you keep customers for repeat business.\n* Legal and Compliance: Boring but essential as this ensures you and the business are protected and following the law.\n   * Structure might be an LLC or Corp or other which depends on how you are taxed and the level of personal liability you have.\n   * Licenses and permits required to operate the business in good standing.\n   * Contracts and warranties that are clear written agreements with customer, partners, employees and vendors. \n\nUnderstand each of these as you build a business plan around them to be prepared to start whatever business you decide on.\n\nNote that these are scalable as they all apply to the smallest of businesses through the largest.",

Freelance, intern, help someone sell, market, or operate. You’ll see real problems fast.\n3. build the habit of execution.

Paying attention to those things is more useful early on than trying to force an idea.\n\nDay to day, business is a lot less glamorous than it sounds.

Those aren't just complaints; they are market gaps.\n3. **The 'Day-to-Day' Reality:** business isn't about vision boards. It’s about 80% admin, customer service, and solving small problems, and 20% growth. Start a 'micro-business' this weekend, sell a service on a freelance platform or flip an item. The goal isn't profit; it's learning how a transaction actually works.\n\nDon't wait for a grand vision. Find a small problem, solve it for one person, and charge for it.

I'm still new to being self-employed and discussing billing + payment, but all of my clients I've had so far have been trustworthy and prompt about paying me. Now that I've been doing this for a while I've started to encounter people who become offended when I discuss payment. \n\nThis week a potential new client inquired with me and was perfectly pleasant during our consultation, but when I told her payment is due immediately at the end of each weekly cleaning she said \"due after EACH cleaning?\" and said \"sure\", but suddenly seemed annoyed. Later on she texts me to confirm a date and time for the first cleaning, and because I still felt uneasy about her willingness to pay I decide to text her \"Perfect, I've scheduled you for \\[date &amp; time\\]. What payment method would work best for you?\" I stated it this way to implicitly remind her that I expect payment same-day, without appearing rude or demanding. \n\nShe immediately cancelled without explanation 😑 She also said she would be in touch with me \"another time\", but if she does would I be justified in politely informing her I no longer want to clean for her? I don't want to perform work for a client who is obviously reluctant to follow my payment policy. I really don't think it's outrageous for a professional cleaner to expect payment for their services at the end of each weekly or biweekly cleaning session. What do you think? What have your experiences with clients who disagree with your payment policies been like? ",

I mentioned it to my teachers in my tetr class, and instead of brushing it off, they actually turned it into a full discussion. Now we’re breaking down the entire campaign:\n\nwhy GAP chose KATSEYE, how fandom overlap works, what the brand is really paying for beyond impressions, and whether these collabs actually move long-term brand value.\n\nHonestly refreshing to analyze something that’s happening right now, not a random case study from years ago. Made classes feel way more relevant than I expected hehe.",

Most brands just want impressions but Gap is playing for fandom overlap. They know that if they can get EYEKONS to see Gap as part of the group's identity, they have secured a loyal customer base for years, not just a one-time sales spike.\n\nAlso, using Milkshake by Kelis was a genius bridge. It gives older shoppers that hit of Y2K nostalgia while the choreography keeps it fresh for Gen Z on TikTok. Its basically a masterclass in intergenerational marketing.",

Then I just said screw it and built something I personally needed - a way to process memories out loud instead of journaling (which never worked for me).\n\nShipped it 11 days ago. Zero sales so far haha. But the learning curve is insane - TikTok algorithms, Reddit karma rules, cold outreach to coaches, LinkedIn groups. None of that shows up in \"how to start a startup\" guides.\n\nMy advice: Don't wait to identify the perfect problem. Just pick something YOU struggle with, build an MVP in 3 weeks, and launch it. You'll learn more in 2 weeks of live product feedback than 6 months of market research.\n\nThe tech skill is the easy part. The hard part is talking to humans who might actually pay you $5 for something you built. That's where the real entrepreneurship starts (in my humble opinion ;)).\n\nWhat problems do YOU personally deal with that your current tech company doesn't solve?",

Every time something annoyed me, whether at work, doing personal admin, or using some clunky tool, I wrote it down. After 2 weeks I had maybe 40 items. Most were garbage but 3-4 were actually interesting because multiple people I talked to had the same frustration.\n\n  \nThe other thing nobody told me is that your first idea will almost certainly not be your final product. The goal of idea #1 is not to build a unicorn, its to get you into the habit of shipping something, talking to users, and iterating. That feedback loop teaches you more than any amount of planning.\n\n  \nAlso the chiropractor comment above is spot on. Your tech skills are a massive advantage but only if you apply them to problems where the existing competition is a spreadsheet or a whiteboard.

No matter how much effort I put in, the ceiling was still someone else’s call. I wanted effort to scale income, and I wanted to choose my own opportunities.\n\nWhat finally got me unstuck wasn’t finding some huge market or world-changing problem. I started by trying to solve a problem I was having myself, productivity and task execution. I was overwhelmed, procrastinating, and frustrated, so I started building something for me. That alone was enough to get me moving.\n\nThat’s honestly my biggest advice. Just start building so you can learn. Don’t get caught up trying to solve world hunger on your first attempt. Your first product probably won’t be great, and that’s fine. The point is that you’re learning by doing.\n\nIf you can even get a few people to pay or subscribe while you’re learning, that’s a huge win. You’re earning and learning at the same time.\n\nIf you’re stuck on “finding a problem,” look at a problem in your own life, even something small or boring.

      "selftext": "Close friend runs a restaurant, and our friend group has this tradition of showing care through the dumbest pranks possible. So year ago, for his birthday dinner I made a set of QR codes for his tables. Custom graphic frame around each one, restaurant name, looked almost professional from a distance. The actual QR part was ugly basic white squares though. And every single one linked to Never Gonna Give You Up. We put them on every table. Guests scanning for the menu, getting rickrolled instead. Small group of friends, everyone cracking up. Job done. After the party the codes came down obviously, but the idea of having proper QR codes in that restaurant stuck with me. Started looking for generators that could actually produce something decent. Turns out most of them are ugly anyway, the better ones want monthly subscriptions, and almost all of them route scans through their own servers first. Since I wanted to learn Python for years already, this became my excuse. Wrote a basic generator for myself. Then every week I was modding or adding something new. Logo embedding, vCard support, batch CSV processing, looked for ways for NFC integration, SVG export. Classic case of a side project spiraling out of control, except this one turned out to be useful.\n\nStarted showing it to people I know. Friends asked for codes for their businesses. Then friends of friends. Lawyers and doctors were the first surprise. They liked the idea of vCard QR codes (digital business cards) but absolutely refuse to put their phone numbers, emails and office details into random online generators. Makes sense, right? Good thing that my tool generates everything offline :D Few transport companies and waste management businesses came, mostly my current cooperators from main business (I produce steel packets for foundries). QR codes on their trucks and trailers linking to company website, turning every vehicle into a moving billboard. From there I managed to upsell a few NFC cards that look like regular business cards but actually collect Google reviews and have vCard QR on them. For the review links I made a custom scraper that pulls business ID from Google without having to check it manually by the owner. Customer taps their phone, review form opens, one scan of vCard and contact added, done.\n\nThen I hit an interesting niche. A national museum I visited had their collection digitized already, so I figured it's worth a shot to collect all the links and generate QRs for them. Built a scraper that pulled around 300 artworks from their website, then mass generated unique QR codes for each one. Foreign visitor scans the code next to a painting, gets the description in their own language. Two features in one pipeline. Sent them the offer by email and got nothing. Went to their offices in person and boom, suddenly they're interested since I took care of the problem from A to Z. After that it just kept going through word of mouth. Car detailers, dental clinics using review stands, real estate agents, an architecture firm needing vCards for their entire team. All from Poland. All through people who knew people.\n\nThat's basically where I'm at now, a bit stuck. My network is tapped out. Everyone who could have needed codes from people I know already has them. Revenue is real but modest. This has been purely organic so far, zero marketing, not a single euro spent on ads or content. Now I'm thinking about whether Instagram and TikTok make sense for something like this. The visual side is there for sure, before and after of a generic pixelated code vs a branded one is satisfying content. But I'm one guy in Poland selling a niche B2B product. Not sure short form video is where my actual buyers spend their time.\n\nHas anyone here been at this exact crossroads? Is such a service still relevant in the current era of AI hype? Side project making money through network, network drying up, trying to figure out the next move. Especially curious if anyone used Instagram or TikTok to sell a niche B2B service, or if that's just making content for other marketers to watch.\n\nWould appreciate any honest thoughts. Not dropping business name or site because I want real feedback, instead of most posts these days that sell a fake story and guide you to their product. I can send you a QR for the rickroll though :D",

          "body": "The museum case is really interesting because that is a repeatable playbook, not just a one-off win. Every museum, gallery, historical site, and tourist attraction in Poland (and Europe) has the same problem: foreign visitors who cant read the local language. You already solved it end-to-end for one museum. Now you have a case study.\n\n  \nFor scaling beyond your network, I would skip Instagram and TikTok for now. Your buyers are operations managers and marketing directors at institutions, they are not scrolling reels. What actually works for niche B2B like this:\n\n  \n1. Cold outreach with the museum case study. Find 50 museums and cultural institutions in Poland, send a short email with before/after photos and the specific problem you solved. Keep it to 3 sentences plus a photo. In person follow-up worked for you once, it will work again.\n\n  \n2. Google My Business and local SEO. People search for things like \"QR code kody firma Polska\" or \"NFC wizytowki\". A simple landing page targeting those keywords in Polish could bring inbound leads without any ad spend.\n\n  \n3. Partner with print shops and sign makers. They already serve the exact businesses that need your product. Offer them a referral cut or white-label arrangement. One good partnership could replace your entire personal network.\n\n  \n4. The dental/medical niche is gold. Doctors care about privacy (your offline generation is a real differentiator here) and they talk to each other. One happy dentist in a professional group chat is worth more than 10k TikTok views.\n\n  \nThe rickroll origin story is genuinely great marketing material though. If you ever do content, lead with that. People remember stories like that way more than feature lists.",

The thought process is just creating a gut-level recognition through familiarity. Like Coca Cola has done. To become a household name. \n\nBut nobody has ever been able to outright *prove* it brings a higher ROI. There are correlation studies but causation has to be inferred.  \n\nI used to rail against \"branding campaigns\" when I had a newsletter for small businesses back in the day. Because there was a lot of misconception at the time. And still is. Small businesses are smarter now for the most part in that they know just \"branding\" is throwing money in the toilet. Passively branding to existing customers is a better approach for most businesses. \n\nThat's true until you have over a billion-dollar budget.

They aim for an emotional impact rather than a rational one because it’s all about memorability. Emotion builds memory structures. The goal is to build greater mental availability than the competition so that your brand comes to mind instead of theirs. \n\nThere’s a priming aspect to it too. Showmanship makes your brand more likeable. Think of Pavlovian conditioning with the ringing of a bell when a dog is given food. They are then conditioned to start salivating when they hear the bell but not given the food. You’re slowly being conditioned to like the brand and perhaps even smile when you see the logo.

Because they’re not even the same experience. That’s kind of how I see the whole “content creation is cheaper now” debate.\n\nYeah, sure, it’s easier and cheaper to churn out content, but that just means *everyone’s* doing it. Thirty years ago, only a handful of companies could even get visibility. Now? Your grandma’s got a TikTok account, and every brand under the sun is flooding the internet with posts. Standing out is harder than ever.\n\nBut then you’ve got something like TV ads. Love ‘em or hate ‘em (efficient, inefficient, whatever) at least they’re still reserved for the big players who can afford them. Less competition, more visibility. And since marketing’s all about trust and familiarity, being able to pop up in places your competitors *aren’t*? That’s still a huge win.\n\nThat’s actually one of the biggest takeaways I got from studying the RIO framework: don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Use multiple channels, but keep your message consistent across all of them. Hammer it home again and again, and create a journey that makes sense for your customers. That way, they actually *get* what you’re about, and you’re not just another voice in the noise.",

Great if you eventually want marketing automation built in.\n\n2. Pipedrive - Visual pipeline view makes it easy to see where deals stand. Very intuitive for teams that want simplicity over feature depth.\n\n3. Less Annoying CRM - Specifically designed for small businesses, straightforward pricing, and low learning curve. No bloat.\n\n4. Streak - If you're already living in Gmail, this is a game changer. Tracks deals right in your email thread.\n\n5. Zoho CRM - Budget-friendly with solid features. Takes a bit more setup but powerful once configured.\n\nQuick clarification questions that would help narrow it down:\n\n- B2B or B2C (or both)?\n- Team size?\n- Any specific integrations you need (email, accounting, e-commerce)?\n- Monthly budget range?\n\nThe \"right\" CRM is the one your team will actually use consistently. Often the simpler option wins over the more powerful one that nobody touches.\n\n",

I work with a lot of small service businesses and the CRM that \"works\" isn’t the one with the most features - it’s the one your team actually opens every day.\n\nFor a small US-based team coming from spreadsheets:\n\nIf your leads come mostly from calls and texts, look at something call-focused rather than email-focused. Most small business CRMs are designed for B2B email-heavy sales, which probably isn’t how your customers buy.\n\nIf you need pipeline tracking and email sequences, Pipedrive is the sweet spot. Visual, doesn’t overwhelm small teams, and the mobile app is solid. HubSpot free works too but the learning curve is steeper and the free tier keeps getting more restricted.\n\nIf your biggest problem is follow-up consistency, a simple system beats a fancy one. I’ve seen businesses double their close rate just by setting up automated reminders when a lead hasn’t been contacted in 24 hours. No CRM required - just discipline and a notification system.\n\nThe spreadsheet-to-CRM transition fails most often when people try to replicate their spreadsheet inside the CRM. Don’t. Start with just contacts, deals, and one follow-up reminder. Add complexity only when you feel the pain of needing it.",

I tried going to the branch on my day off but then I'm spending my only free time dealing with banking instead of resting or prepping for the next event.\n\nI looked into those smart ATMs that accept cash deposits but they're mostly for personal accounts, business account deposits require going inside to a teller. I asked my bank if they could just let me use the ATM for business deposits and they said it's against their policy, something about fraud prevention.\n\nSome food truck owners I know just spend the cash on supplies and inventory so they don't have to deposit it, but my accountant said that's a grey area for tax purposes and I should be depositing everything. I'm stuck between following the rules and wasting hours of my life going to bank branches during the only time they're open.\n\nHow are other cash based businesses handling this without losing their minds?",

I mean...this is literally what they're for, even if they're less popular now than they were 30 years ago.\n\n  \nThis does also sound like an administrative shortcoming for your business.  If you're nervous to have lots of cash on hand the solution is to increase your physical security such as installing a safe in your truck\n\n  \nOr you arrange to transport some smaller amount of cash at some point during the event.  Like if an event runs from 17:00-22:00 you arrange for a 19:30 cash run.  Pretty typically this is often useful for any other last minute issues that might come up.",

Typically in your chart of accounts, you have a CASH [on hand] or UNDEPOSITED FUNDS account that cash received is logged to. Once it is deposited, it gets logged out of the cash account into your bank account. \n\nIf you choose to buy supplies with cash instead, then the receipt is logged against that cash account, instead of against your bank account or credit card account. \n\nObviously depending on your system and how you log transactions in general, it does change the nuance, but that's something for you to discuss with a more experienced accountant in your area who can provide more detailed specifics personalized to your business and the area you live in. \n\nThe government does not care that you've used cash, they care whether you've logged it correctly.",

What types of products or services are they likely to be using? Now, look for the people that sell that. Get to know them and their business and find out what other events they go to. The idea is to leave an impression and keep yourself fresh in their mind. These are people that will refer you when given the opportunity, and if you like them/their product or service, you now have someone to refer your client to in the event that you have that opportunity. \n\nFor example, we do managed IT for SMBs. I've found that  CPAs, fractional CFO/CIOs, business consultants, and Insurance agents that write a lot of Cyber policies are great referral partners for us. When I go to networking events, these are the people that I try to talk to the most. I never try to force the conversation, but when they inevitably ask, I have tailored verbiage and explanations based on what they do to help them easily identify the types of leads I'm looking for. \n\nNetworking is a marathon, not a sprint.",

I had read about some studies that showed that people got as much of a dopamine boost from talking about doing things as they got from actually doing things. So to avoid the talk, talk, talk trap. I kept my mouth shut. There were a few people who were mentor types who I talked to, but for the most part I didn't tell friends about all the work I was doing setting up my business. My mantra was that my work would do the talking later. It kind of drove my wife crazy when people would ask my about what I was doing and I would just talk about parenting. For me, personally, I could feel the energy that would have gone into talking about it go into actually doing things to build it. It may or may not work for other people, but I really credit this strategy for helping me stay focused on the work instead of seeking affirmation from talking about it.\n\nLearning basic spreadsheet skills really helped manage things before I got to the point where I could use purpose built tools. I still use spreadsheets, but not as much anymore.\n\nI ran things cheap for as long as it made sense. I think many people see spending money as an accomplishment, like, \"Look at these sweet chairs I bought, I'm a legit business!\" Avoid that.",

BUT when you really know nothing about how to start a business, have no one to help you, and need to do it quickly… it’s probably your best chance at not missing something. If I had given things a little more thought beforehand, I probably could’ve gotten things up and going on my own with a little research and guidance from my mother in law that used to put together shell corporations for the law firm she worked for. Really wish I would’ve known that last little detail. 😕\n\nAnyway, from a bookkeeping standpoint… find out what needs to be filled out at the state level and what needs to be submitted at the federal level. Product based businesses will have different requirements than service based businesses. And then take note of when federal taxes will need filed. Some do estimations quarterly, some do it annually with their personal taxes… and that’ll depend on what type of business you file for (LLC, Sole Proprietorship, S Corp, etc).\n\nFrom a personal standpoint, make sure you have the time and resources to support this venture. I got myself into debt pretty quickly thinking I needed to have a bunch of options. I have a product based business and while inventory is important… my inventory grew way too large, very quickly. So, space became scarce for me. I’m working full time because my business doesn’t support a livable wage yet, so time to build a website and create marketing campaigns rats DEEP into family time for me. I feel like even when I’m home, I work until I go to bed and not even on anything that I actually sell… it’s all on stuff just to hopefully get my business in front of people that might hopefully buy my products. I hope that one day this ship rights itself because right now I feel like I don’t know which way is up. It’s not for the faint of heart, that’s for sure! I wish I would have had a clearer, more edited picture of what I wanted to offer and how I wanted to offer it… instead I feel like I’m always scrambling.\n\nTL:DR- LegalZoom is helpful, but pricey. And do some market research before investing time and money into it. Like others have said, you need to make sure there’s actually a market for what you want to offer.",

I built Toad (simple PM tool) because I was drowning in overcomplicated tools at my investment banking job. Using it daily meant I knew exactly what needed fixing.\n\n2) Talk to people who have the problem before building much. I wasted months on features nobody asked for.\n\n3) Charge money early. Free users will waste your time. Paying customers tell you what actually matters.\n\nMistakes to avoid:\n\n1) Don’t build in isolation. I went weeks without talking to anyone about what I was working on and lost momentum.\n\n2) Don’t wait for perfection. Ship something ugly that works.\n\n3) Don’t expect launch day to matter. Nobody’s waiting for your product except maybe your mum.\nTools: Keep it dead simple early on. I use Toad to track what I’m building (Today/This Week/Later grids). Stripe for payments. That’s basically it.\n\nIf starting today: I’d focus on getting 10 paying customers before building any new features. Prove people will pay, then figure out what to build next.\n\nWhat problem are you thinking about solving?\n\nMost of all, don’t be too hard on yourself!!",

I used simple tools to stay organized, but the bigger unlock was consistently listening to how potential customers talked about their problems, especially in places like forums and communities. Patterns start showing up pretty fast if you actually look for them.\n\nAt some point I started using Syndr AI to surface those recurring conversations instead of manually digging through threads. Not as a planning tool, more as a way to sanitycheck whether an idea was actually showing demand before I went deeper. That saved me from building a few things nobody really cared about.\n\nBiggest advice start messy, talk to real people early, and don’t overbuild systems until you understand what problem you’re really solving.

      "selftext": "My construction business that I started last year is owes $40k by a client who has been promising to pay since June. I call him on a weekly basis and he barely answers, and always has an excuse as to why payment is being delayed.\n\nI know that he doesn’t intend to pay. I live in Alberta Canada and I have registered liens on the properties he owes me money for, but he doesn’t seem to care. I know I can start civil litigation / take them to small claims court but I’ve heard this process can take years and even if I get a judgement in your favour, it’s up to me how I can enforce it.\n\nI’m at such a loss for what to do because I have bills and invoices from my subcontractors that I’m late on because of this client too.\n\nAny advice?",

Make them uncomfortable.\n\nHere's some other things you can do (obvious pros and cons to doing each of these):\n\n\\-Use social media to publicly shame them (if you're in a major metro this probably won't be that effective but in smaller towns it definitely will get folks talking).\n\n\\-Don't just call, confront them in person, knock on their door, ask them when you're gonna get paid and let them know this isn't the last time they'll see you. \n\n\\-If you have to get documents served to them, don't do it at their house, do it at their work or somewhere else public you know they'll be.\n\n  \nI know it isn't comforting at this point but this should also be a lesson, tighten up your payment terms, make them pay more up front or collect more often (oftentimes laws govern what you can or can't charge so follow them).\n\n  \nGood luck for real.\n\n",

The filing fee is small compared to what you're owed.\n\nFew things:\n\n1. Stop calling him weekly. You're just reminding him that you haven't taken action yet. Every week that passes without legal consequences tells him he can keep stalling.\n\n2. Send a formal demand letter via registered mail. Give him 14 days. State the amount, the lien references, and that you'll be filing a claim. Sometimes the letter alone gets people moving.\n\n3. If he doesn't respond, file the claim. You don't necessarily need a lawyer for Provincial Court, but with $40k on the line it might be worth a consultation at least.\n\n4. The liens are good. If he ever tries to sell or refinance those properties, he can't without clearing them. But liens don't put money in your pocket on their own.\n\n5. For future projects: progress billing with clear payment terms in the contract. Net 30 max. No more work starts until the previous invoice is paid. Painful lesson but you only learn it once.",

I keep getting groups of customers sometimes 15–20 people, asking for the same specific item or style. The problem is I might only have 3–4 of those pieces or a few similar ones. People are actually willing to wait for restocks, which is great but after a few weeks I end up having to message them explaining that I just couldn’t source more of it and they’re understandably disappointed. I know exactly what my customers want, I just can’t seem to get enough of it.\n\nUp until now I’ve been sourcing from smaller vintage wholesalers, local markets and random finds but it’s clearly not scaling with demand anymore. I feel like I’m starting to lose customers not because they don’t like my shop but because I can’t provide enough quantity of the things they want. So I wanted to ask here where do you find bigger more reliable vintage suppliers?\n\n",

While few things are truly one-of-a-kind, there not making any more, so getting repeats of anything are difficult.\n\nAssuming you want to stay true to being a vintage business, as many of us do, you just have to be willing to scale your picking. Estate sales, garage sales, Facebook marketplace, and frequent thrift store visits. Trying to find people will to sell larger “lots” of items you specialize in and you can buy inventory in bulk and at lower prices. I always have 3 times as much inventory in my garage as I can sell at one time in my shop. \n\nSome of the larger stores get to a point where they can afford to pay professional pickers, but then your prices have to go up. I don’t do clothes personally, but the dealers I know who do and successful often network their way to finding individuals from whom they can purchase their entire collection for a set price and then sort the sellable from the donation pile. My mother (also a dealer) does this and will often leave with 8-10 huge trash bags of clothes from one house. Half to 2/3 goes to donation, but when she bought it all for $400 the margins are insane. \n\nThe purchasing often takes more time than the actual selling, so you really have to commit yourself to that being a central part of the business model.",

Unfortunately Gildan shirts suck and I need to get 5 more that won't shrink to short fat guy size instead of thin average height guy size after 5 washes. Anyways, I'm early 40s but EVERYONE thinks I look early 30s at best. Nobody initially thinks I'm the owner of my brick and mortar shop. The polos had an instant effect. I'm pretty in tune with people's reactions and behaviors on the other side of the counter and the shirts immediately came with a different air in even long time customers attitudes towards me. I've previously had mono-color shirts, store logo shirts, but the polos were far better. \n\nI've always kinda known this would be the case, I would just always prefer to buy 100-150+ in products rather than risk it on shirts that fall apart or shrink or fade. The trial run went really well, so I plan to order a better set in polyester or something a bit more expensive",

The majority of the time isn't actually doing the work you like to do, it's handling inventory, legal compliance, marketing, sales, and all the other stuff that needs to be done around the actual things your business does.\n\n2. To quote a comedian \"Do you think a crackhead wakes up and just says they're too tired to go get crack today? No! So don't let a crackhead out hustle you\". \n\n3. I argue this is the important one, shut up and listen to people and ask questions about them and their problems. Most people don't care too much about your half an hour sales pitch. Obviously tell them what you're offering but shut up and understand their problems and how you're uniquely qualified to address their problems. I've lost jobs by not taking a minute and understanding my client and I've won customers over by shutting up and listening.\n\nBonus insight: Don't get hung up on the sale you didn't close or customer whom didn't buy. Take a second and see what you could have done to be better and move on. You're gonna fail but you should be marketing enough that there's two more coming behind him to sell to and not everyone is your customer. \n\nHope this helps someone.",

If everything works out ill have the buyout payment recovered in 6 months and back to profitability by q3.\n\nVenting here. Business partner for the past 5 years has up and quit. Demanded an insane payout, which was denied due to valuation not supporting it. Have countered with an offer that is grounded a bit more in reality while taking into account the massive risk I will be taking on as a solo venture. He's been less than pleasant about the whole ordeal, and has decided to just stop participating in operations while the payout is negotiated. A bit overwhelmed at the moment, mostly the books, as it has been his task to manage over the years. During the valuation, I discovered drastically inflated inventory assets and cash holdings. Have crawled the books trying to get everything proper but it's so overwhelming. How do you solo acts do it? Very impressive for single owner businesses to work, especially at the ground floor. I imagine in a year when I have more systems set up to support me and the business, it won't feel so catastrophic, but man, at the moment it's very intimidating and exhausting to even keep my head above water. Will be scaling back the entire business ad essentially rebuilding it brick by brick, this time without ay fuzzy back end details. It looks like a lot of nights in the future will be pairing panic attacks with whiskey haha.",

The bookkeeping chaos is the worst part when a partner who \"handled the numbers\" leaves - you suddenly realize you have no idea what's actually happening in your own business.\n\nTwo practical things that helped me:\n\n1. Get a part-time bookkeeper ASAP, even if just for 10 hours to untangle everything. Way cheaper than the stress and mistakes you'll make trying to learn it from scratch during a crisis.\n\n2. Document every single process as you rebuild. When you're a solo operator, your systems ARE your business. Write down how you invoice, how you track inventory, how you do payroll - future you will thank you, and it makes hiring easier when you're ready.\n\nThe panic attacks suck but they'll fade once you have visibility into your own numbers. You've got 5 years of customers and 65k/month - that foundation is real. The backend mess is fixable.",

Passwords, processes, client contacts. If your partner has info you need, get it before things get worse.\n\n2. Talk to a lawyer before making big moves. Even a 30-min consultation can save you months of pain later.\n\n3. Assess if the business is viable solo. Sometimes the answer is no, and thats OK. Better to know early.\n\n4. Reach out to your clients directly. Transparency builds trust. Let them know whats happening (at a high level) and that youre committed.\n\nThe emotional part is real too. Losing a business partner feels like a breakup. Give yourself space to process it while still protecting the business.\n\nI write about these founder challenges in my newsletter if you want more tactical stuff: https://substack.com/@francoisdelpte",

      "selftext": "I opened my dermatology practice 18 months ago. Things are going well, too well, actually. I went from 12 patients a day to 28 in a year and a half. The problem is my overhead has scaled way faster than my revenue. I started with one front desk person and one MA. I’ve now added a second MA and a billing coordinator, and I still need more help. My monthly payroll went from $8K to $22K, and when you add benefits, payroll taxes, and workers’ comp, I’m spending close to $30K/month on staff for a practice that’s netting $35K.\n\nThe bottleneck right now is admin. My front desk person is juggling phones, patient intake, appointment scheduling, referral coordination, and prior authorizations for procedures. She’s great but she’s one person doing a three-person job, and things are slipping: missed prior auths that delay procedures, phone calls going to voicemail, patients waiting 15 minutes just to check in. I know it’s hurting the patient experience.\n\nI’ve been doing the math on hiring a second front desk person and it’s brutal, $38–$42K salary plus $8–10K in benefits and taxes. That’s another $50K annual commitment when I’m barely keeping margins healthy. A friend who owns an urgent care told me he uses remote medical assistants from overseas who are HIPAA-trained and cost around $9–10/hour with no benefits overhead. He says they handle his phones, scheduling, and insurance verifications.\n\nI’m skeptical but intrigued. For any small practice owners who’ve used virtual medical assistants to scale: how did you handle the transition? Did patients notice or care that the person answering the phone was remote? And how do you manage someone who isn’t physically in the office? I need to grow my team without destroying the margins that make this practice viable.",

Your patient experience is going to be much better by adding the $7/visit the additional admin person would cost, vs going with an overseas option.\n\nEdit: another thought.

That's the real bottleneck. Your prices are too low for the volume you're seeing. \n\n\n$35k/month is something to be proud of as a first time practice owner! However, when looked at from the biggest picture of what is possible for your practice, it pales in comparison to the numbers you could be collecting each month. \n\n\n$35k/month is low compared to $135k/month collections for the same amount of staff. If you can't do more volume, you need to raise prices. Otherwise your practice will drown. \n\n\nI wouldn't recommend outsourcing patient facing admin. Backend can be a different story. But having phenomenal front end staff who make every visit for a patient an absolute delight is what will allow you to collect more, with higher quality clients, and be able to transition to a cash only practice where clients happily pay you because your office is the best experience they have ever encountered. That is what the right front end staff with the right attitude and trained the right way can do for you. \n\n\nThere is so much more naunce to this, and this is simply a bite of what I'd cover if you were my client, but I think it should help turn you in the right direction. \n\n\nIt's pricing/cash flow. Not admin. Optimizing admin comes after you optimize and increase your pricing and cash flow. \n\n\nDM me if you have questions, I'm happy to help.

Your practice is basically at capacity due to the bottleneck so additional customers help you less than they normally would. \n\n\nSo if you combine those three:\n- automated where possible (incurs expenses) \n- raise prices (increases revenue) \n- reduce marketing (reduces expenses) \n\n\n\nYou should see improvement on margin. \n\n\nEdit: I now understand his prices are contracted. The other two areas still make sense to me. ",

It’s not a great feeling especially knowing they were ready to buy. What makes it harder is that I feel like I have a good understanding of what people want. The interest is there and I’m seeing clear patterns in demand. My biggest issue right now is finding reliable ways to replenish those popular items fast enough.\n\n\n\n  \nSo far I’ve mostly relied on smaller vendors and independent sources which worked well in the beginning but now it feels like I’ve outgrown that stage. I’m at the point where I need something more consistent if I want to keep growing and avoid turning customers away. For those who’ve experienced something similar how did you handle it?",

Is it automated? The faster you are able to communicate to your supply chain that a product is in demand, the faster you are able to communicate to your users whether you can satisfy their needs. It's also possible that you might be able to meet demand better if your suppliers knew ahead of time that there was a burst of interest. \n\nYou're working with small vendors and independent sources. Are you sure that isn't a major contributing factor to your existing growth?\n\nGrowth and consistency can be derived from various sources, not just just by adapting to existing big business models. \n\nReview case studies of businesses who have failed despite being in a position to grow simply because they changed too much of what made them unique and attractive in the first place. If you are doing well with your secret recipe, then more secret recipe is better than changing the recipe. \n\nWhat about expanding with more suppliers and different products that are similar or in the same niche? You say that you've analyzed and identified what trends exist that would allow you to pre-empt situations like this. Talk to your suppliers. See what they can do to meet demand, or work with other suppliers who can meet your demand while still providing the same quality product. Diversify your catalog. That would allow you to consistently order for demand and also offer related products to offset low supply. \n\nI've worked in e-commerce as a software developer for a long time, and my clients often want a quick solution, technological or otherwise, to problems like these.

A few things that helped me when I hit this stage:\n\n1. **Pre-orders with deposits** - When something sells out, let people put down 20-30% to reserve it. Shows you real demand and gives you capital to buy inventory.\n\n2. **Supplier tiering** - Keep your small vendors for unique/hard-to-find items, but for your consistent top sellers, find 2-3 mid-size suppliers who can do recurring orders. Redundancy saves you when one falls through.\n\n3. **Track your velocity** - If you know Product X sells 15 units/month, you can plan reorders before you hit zero. Even a simple spreadsheet with reorder points changed my game.\n\n4. **Be honest with customers** - A waitlist with realistic timelines beats \"sorry, sold out.\" People respect transparency and will often wait if you communicate well.\n\nThe transition from scrappy sourcing to real supply chain management is one of the harder jumps.

          "body": "&gt; maybe fewer damage claims or disputes.\n\nWhere have you heard this.  I have no insider knowledge but everything I've heard is the opposite and that is common sense IMO.   More touch points more liability.\n\nIn general to your question I would ask back, \"Do you?\"\n\nFirst is this something your guests even want or would use let alone expect.  If price is a major selling point they are not going to want to do it just for tip reasons. \n\nAlso consider the groups who wont use it and what percentage of the guests they make up.   People with nicer cars often won't use valet for obvious reasons.  Business travelers often won't because they don't want to waste time waiting for the car.  And people with rentals may not because of rental agreement rules or fears of damage.  etc etc\n\nSecond consider the costs.  You will need this 24/7 or at least a way for the people to get their cars.   Would having an extra one or two staff members working at all times hurt profit?  (And is that even the best use of extra staff?)   How about the the insurance costs?  Sure you could simply hire a company to provide these workers and the insurance but of course that will likely cost similar if not more vs direct hires.  \n\nThird consider the headaches vs peak check in vs check out.  Part of why business travelers wont use it.  As people are waiting for their cars to be moved/brought up.   Sure it is bad now but would it be better?   \n\nAnd now instead of them blaming some other guest they blame you directly.   \n\nSure it may avoid some idiot leaving their car up front while they take their bags up and spend 30 mins in their room before parking.   But will they actual use the valet or is that just a car making the valet service worse?  \n\nAnd if that is an issue there are other options to consider to combat it like signage and staff training.  \n\nIn the end IMO if a hotel doesn't already have valet they likely are not in the right market segment to add it.  People know at least subconsciously they are paying more to get more.  They are not expecting or wanting to pay for valet when they book a place that shouldn't.\n\nIDK how much more per night you would need to charge to cover valet but prices would go up and tipping means most will pay more even if it doesn't.   \n\nIf those people were willing to pay more for valet and etc why didn't they?   Really think about that.   Don't hunt down customers who wouldn't stay at your place unless where they wanted wasn't available.  And don't price yourself out of customers who would stay if the price was just a bit less.  \n\nYour competition is unlikely to be the 5 star hotel in town.   It is the other 2-3 star(?) places.  Price and location plus basic quality are what you are likely competing on.  Free breakfast might help you win but I doubt valet would.   It just isn't something people in that market are IMO normally looking for.",

      "selftext": "Hi Reddit,\n\nI run a small business in Canada and recently had a situation with a U.S. customer. She ordered a product, paid for shipping at checkout, but when UPS tried to deliver it, they demanded an additional $95 in tariffs and fees. She refused the delivery and asked for a refund.\n\nI want to issue a full refund, but only once the package is sent back to me, which is standard practice to protect my business from revenue loss. Most of the time, packages are returned within 2 weeks, sometimes sooner. I also need to track it to make sure it’s coming back safely.\n\nI’ve explained this to her, along with the fact that tariffs are determined by U.S. border control, not me, and that unfortunately some customers end up paying nothing, some pay a small fee, and some (like her) get hit with a high fee.\n\nMy question for Reddit: if you were me, would you have handled it differently? I’m genuinely trying to balance customer satisfaction with protecting my business. Do you wait for the package to be sent back to you? I sell bird toys and most of my orders average $100+. This package was $248 CAD dollars. \n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts!",

I say this because UPS has been incinerating parcels, at least according to the news (Google UPS incinerating packages). If it is incinerated you'll have even more troubles as you won't be able to prove delivery in the event of a chargeback. \n\nSecond, I agree that you should have the package in your possession but you'll also have to make sure UPS clears the goods back into Canada as a return otherwise you'll end up on the hook for Canadian tariffs. Hopefully you are already registered with CARM. \n\nI say all of this because I do a  lot of consulting for cross border businesses - and things have gotten crazy. Tariffs in the USA, CARM in Canada... I make money doing it but I can see how it is hurting small businesses. \n\nAlso - google freightos tariff calculator. They have made a great calculator that adds in all of the funky duties into the USA as long as you know your product. You can either provide a tariff estimate on your website or tell your customers to look it up before ordering. This might help prevent future occurrences. ",

But on the good, responsible business side of things and wanting to treat people the way you'd like to be treated, I say they've rejected the shipment so it's on you now to retrieve that package or eat the loss and they should he refunded immediately.  \n\nWe had all the right paperwork sorted early on last summer when this tariff nonsense went into effect. We are fully CUSMA-complaint.  Our first few dozen shipments went off without much of a hitch, aside from the very first one being rejected at the border because we had bad information from CBP, and then for about 2 weeks everything was taking a LONG time getting through customs, likely because of that bad advise we'd initially worked off of that everyone else was also working off of jamming up customs with all the rejections. Then it happened... Our first collision with customs. We received a $600US customs bill on a rejected package worth $100US retail.  No explanation, no way to fight it. And they would not return the package until we paid the bill, so we surrendered it but that didn't stop the bill. They're still trying to pursue us for it.  We had 3 others that week in transit to the US that went the same way and we immediately shut down all shipping to the US at that point.  They would not audit the bill nor would they detail the \"government charges\" of that exorbitant bill or any of the others; one was $275 on a $45 item, and these numbers don't include the return shipping bill either! \n\nAll shipping platforms and couriers have been saying that the shipper is responsible for the import charges if the shipment is rejected, which is insane as there's no actual import happening then. I could see them charging their brokerage fee for the little work they did in clearing the package but that's the least of the charges.  So be prepared that whomever cleared this for you may be coming back to you for the import fees that the customer rejected and to get this back you'll be paying the shipping a second time.  \n\nIf I were you I'd just be a good Judy and take the loss responsibly.  It's a tough pill to swallow but chalk it up to a learning lesson.  What if you tell them you'll only refund when you get it back in your hands but then it never gets returned? They ordered goods from you and then received a huge bill they weren't expecting and rejected it and returned it. If it were you would you not be fuming if the company wasn't returning your money when you did not have the product?\n\nWe're all forced to relearn how we do things in this new political climate unfortunately.  What's worked for so long is no longer feasible sadly. It comes at a time that we need an easier go of things, not more complicated versions of it!",

      "selftext": "As an employee at several companies over the years I was frustrated with the terrible, toxic culture, lack of structure, lack of clear boundaries, roles or expectations, the inefficiencies, etc. Once I had gained significant experience in the field, I went into consulting as a way to both get out from under the mess and potentially help companies change the way the operate.\n\nEven in roles as a director, I was hardly ever listened to in terms of what need to change or how, so I felt that I needed to be an outsider to actually get the owner's ear.\n\nAnd to a degree, this works. But honestly, it's really only at the larger and more corporate companies where I ever feel like anything I do actually gets put into place.\n\nhere are some of the pitfalls I see over and over again in small business:\n\n\\- Owners consumed by fear and paranoia. They keep a lot of info that isn't proprietary under wraps as if no one can be trusted with it, and then employees can't do their jobs because they don't have all of the information and tools they need. Even keeping different departments siloed from each other because they are afraid of them \"talking to each other\", when collaboration is necessary to complete the work. When employees leave in droves, whether to a competitor or to start their own enterprise, it usually isn't because they came in with that intention. Most people would prefer to stay at a job if it is tolerable rather than risk another unknown. So if you constantly hemorrhage staff, it is due to the toxic work environment, burnout, lack of feeling like they can do anything purposeful with the company.\n\n\\- constantly moving the goals posts, setting employees up for failure, and needing to be \"the only one who does anything right\". I have watched countless times as owners give 30% of the tools needed to do the job to someone, then call them into the office to ask why they didn't complete it the way they were never trained to and didn't have the necessary tool or information to do so. Then they often go on a rant that they can't trust anyone, no one wants to work anymore, no one know what they are doing. Yes, that last one is often true, and it's often the owner's fault. Later they reveal some document or file or tool or instruction that the employee would have need to complete the task, which now has to be redone in a waste of everyone's time and energy, but the owner still wants the employee to grovel about what a huge mistake they made.\n\n\\- zero accountability while constantly blaming other. I can't count on all my fingers and toes the number of times an owner was in the middle of berating someone for an error, then it is found that something was signed or submitted by the owner and it was their mistake, only to have them then go on a big showy rant \" WHO SIGNED MY NAME? WHO DID THIS?\". You lose respect and credibility when you want to constantly call out everyone else but can never own up to anything.\n\n\\-no real process for onboarding or continued education. Just slapping an additional title onto a grunt worker who seems to fear losing their job more than stroking out from running half the company for minimum wage, and calling it a day.  So now Gary is also HR on top of 3 other titles, as you send new employees to him and expect him to figure it out with no guidance, then will yell at Gary when you find out there isn't the full blown new employee training happening that you didn't actually hire a full time HR employee or HR consultant to build and put into place. And you wonder why people keep leaving after a couple months. No, they aren't all \"lazy people who don't want to work\". They literally never felt like part of the company or had a sense of their role, because there as no true onboarding or training.\n\n\\-no structure in general. No sense of project management, no debriefing to improve regular operations. Every day is like doing triage on passengers of a train that just derailed. Day after day after day. Everything feels on the fly, at the whims of the owner/owners, never forms into something more cohesive.\n\nThe majority if the small businesses I have attempted to help still ran like start ups even if they were 5, 10, 20 years old. And that's why they stay small and don't get anywhere. It isn't your marketer, it isn't the economy, it is most likely the owner.\n\nAnd the grand finale of all of this is, they seldom even let me come in and do my job either. They don't really want anything to change. At least I don't work for them, but it's gotten to the point where it's even getting too exhausting to work WITH them. I identify where changes are needed then they tell me they don't want to or can't change that because of XYZ. I still get paid either way, but it's really not fulfilling at all to just collect checks from tyrants for advice they won't use. I'd rather help companies actually put these things into action and improve.\n\nPlease, if you are a small business owner: recognize your areas of non-expertise, hire people into those roles, allow them to actually do their jobs, stop thinking you do everything perfectly and better than everyone in every department (you don't, and you look silly marching around micromanaging everyone while actually making things worse in your wake), show appreciation toward your employees instead of contempt, stop trying to control every detail and focus on being captain of the ship, taking it in a direction instead of spinning in circles.",

I took out a $125k business loan and borrowed a little more from family. We opened back in August. \n\nSo far it’s been going fairly well, we do about $13k-15k in revenue every month and I pay myself a $48k salary with another full time and part time employee. Operating costs are about $10k-12k monthly (this includes my salary). We are in a small town so it’s nothing crazy but we are the only coffee shop and the only bakery so it works.\n\nUnfortunately I have had some serious health issues and as much as I do not want to, I need to switch career paths, one less aggressive on my body and mind. I owe about $100k on my business loan. Does selling my business for $150k seem super unrealistic?

My sister in law owns a coffee shop and bakery, she needed the money to help improve her family's life style, she was passionate about providing a good service to her small town (she also lives in an small town) so she built great products, hired trustworthy staff, and put good systems in place.\n\nNow it's hands off, it just makes her money, and causes her no stress. This is very possible to achieve, as she's basically a single mom with a toddler and an infant, and she did it all with so much stress simultaneously hitting her each month as she built it. Just because it wasn't easy, doesn't mean it can't be accomplished. \n\nSo I'm hopeful that you don't just throw away your creation when it's only just begun.

Lol\n\nThey're always dreamers out there and some of these people have deep pockets or can get big loans. \nIt never hurts to start out high even if it's a shoot the moon price and see what type of interest you get. \nWe are at probably all time peak levels for people with the mindset to start and run their own business but unfortunately the economy doesn't lend itself quite so much to that as it did in sometimes for people but people want to do it. \nWe also are at the best time in history to get the word out to the most number of people and market your business for sale because of online connectivity etc that we just didn't have 25 years ago. \n\nThe biggest thing that struck me and reading your post was I cringed when you said you put that kind of money into the place once you started. \nYou redid EVERYTHING.\nIt's even worse that's your leasing but I would have still cringed even if you had bought a piece of property and redid everything and put that kind of money into it. \n\nYou're lucky that you're doing well with the business and I commend you for not being too greedy. \nI see way too many people in business today who are what I call hungry / greedy and these people aren't happy with any level of business they have and they certainly wouldn't be happy with 48k salary for themselves. \n\nThese weirdos today will start a company and they'll start the wrong way around. \nThey will decide how much money they need to or want to make up front and then figure out how much to charge based on that. \nThat's not how a business should be looked at or how it should be started or the pricing etc be figured. \nLuckily your business is all about low dollar and high volume. \nMany people and many industries have turned what used to be lowered to mid ticket prices and because they don't want to work so hard or do so much volume, cranked up the prices two and three times so now it's low volume high dollar. \n\nI'm just a minimalist and it's my assumption and you may be able to give a better estimate but I don't see how it could vary too much, that since you're in that small town and you're the only shop of that nature around, you would have likely gotten the same amount of business and made the same amount of money if you wouldn't had redone everything.\nYou could have done half as much or probably 25% as much especially if you focused on only the very important things and some cheap cosmetic doctrine to make things look nice and appealing. \n\nHad this been the case you would now owe a lot less so you can either sell your business for less money for a nice fast sale or you be making a lot more profit on the sale. \n\nI still think you will do okay though because any type of freestanding already established business with numbers that can be proved is typically going to cost a pretty penny. \n\nI've looked into different businesses or at least paid attention to them for over 25 years and it's been hard to get any type of decent business for under 250k. \nNow not all of these were at least place where you were just buying the business and some of them had real estate with them but businesses have always been high. \n\nEven just on the most basic numbers and not from a financial advisor situation, if you're making almost 50k yourself each year from a business than any person who is looking to start their own business and work there as their main income will probably be okay with the fact at the purchase price is three times what their annual salary will be. \nIt looks like you've already paid down a substantial amount of the debt so if these payments are all coming from the revenue from the shop that I don't think a lot of people would have a problem paying 150k to get a turnkey business as long as they're okay with the 48,000 salary themselves for the work they have to do. \n\nDon't know what the terms of your loan are and what's the maximum time it could take to pay off the other 100k but it all sounds pretty feasible to me.",

Sounds okay until you factor in that I'm working every single day.\n\nThe problem isn't the hours. I knew it would be hard. The problem is the hours keep going up but revenue stays flat.\n\nThree months ago I was working maybe 50 hours a week. Now it's closer to 70. I'm not taking on more clients. I'm just spending more time on things that feel productive but probably aren't.\n\nI'm using all these tools to \"save time.\" Email automation, meal plan templates, Calendly, ChatGPT for writing responses, APOB for videos, probably 10 other things I'm forgetting. Every week I add another tool that's supposed to make things easier.\n\nBut I'm busier than ever. I spend half my day managing the tools. Checking if the automation worked. Fixing things that broke. Tweaking settings. It's like I'm running a tech stack instead of a coaching business.\n\nMy girlfriend asked me last week why I'm always on my laptop. I tried to explain I'm \"building systems\" but she just looked at me and said \"you're always busy but nothing ever changes.\"\n\nShe's right. My client count hasn't moved in two months. I had three people cancel last month. When I asked why, one of them said my messages \"feel like templates\" and she's paying for personal coaching. That one hurt because I've been trying to be more efficient with check-ins so I have time for other stuff.\n\nI think I'm using all these tools to avoid doing the actual hard work. The hard work is reaching out to people. Asking for referrals. Actually talking to potential clients instead of hoping my content brings them in. Sitting down with each client for real conversations instead of sending them a template.\n\nBut that stuff is uncomfortable and slow and I can't measure it. Tools feel like progress. I can see the metrics. I can tell myself I'm being smart and efficient.\n\nMeanwhile I'm working 70 hours a week to make $4500/month and I barely see my girlfriend anymore. Last Sunday she asked if I wanted to go hiking and I said I needed to make videos for the week. I didn't even go outside that day.\n\nI see other coaches who seem to work normal hours and make more than me. I asked one of them how he manages everything and he said \"I just talk to people.\" No automation. No content calendar. He just has conversations and asks for referrals.\n\nI don't know how to stop. Every time I think about turning off one of these systems I panic because what if that was the thing that was actually working?\n\nI'm trapped in this thing where I'm too busy to figure out if I'm doing the right things.\n\nDid I build myself into a corner?",

The tool trap is real and it's insidious because every new tool feels like progress.\n\n\n\nHere's what I think is happening based on what you described: you're using tools to avoid the uncomfortable work. Talking to people, asking for referrals, having real conversations -- that stuff is scary because it involves potential rejection. Setting up an automation sequence feels productive and safe. But safe doesn't grow the business.\n\n\n\nThe guy who just talks to people and makes more than you? He's doing the one thing that actually generates revenue. Everything else is a support function.\n\n\n\nWhat worked for me when I was in this exact trap:\n\n\n\n\\- I did a \"tool audit.\" Listed every tool I pay for and every tool I spend time managing. Then I asked one question for each: \"Did this directly lead to a new client in the last 90 days?\" Most of them didn't. I cancelled about 60% of them.\n\n\n\n\\- I set a rule: no more than 30 minutes per day on \"systems.\" Everything else is client-facing work.\n\n\n\n\\- I went back to basics. Made a list of 10 people I could call that day and asked for referrals or just caught up. Within a week I had 2 new leads from conversations.\n\n\n\nYour girlfriend is right. You're always busy but nothing changes. The discomfort you feel when you think about stopping a system is the same discomfort that's keeping you from doing the work that actually matters.

But instead of doubling down on more conversations and referrals, you built a mini tech company around it.\n\nMost small coaching businesses don’t scale with tools. They scale with relationships. And yeah, clients can feel templates instantly. The moment it feels automated, it stops feeling like coaching and starts feeling like an app.\n\nIf it were me, I’d probably cut half the stack and go back to basics for a month. Fewer systems. More calls. More direct convos. More “hey, who else do you know that needs this?” What would break if you turned off 70 percent of the tools for two weeks and just focused on talking to clients and prospects?",

          "body": "As a coaching business I think you are overcomplicating things depending on your goals. Ive been a PT, mixed with some online coaching and now I run a solo clinic. \nThere are different paths you can go for online coaching. One is the higher value one and the other is lower value but more clients.\nIf you go for higher value one you can forget about finished templates, you can have a few that you customize to fit each client but never identical. You need to focus on giving as much value for the client, make it feel as much personal and customized as possible. Good follow ups/sessions, plans, tests, measurable progress. Make your \"product\" as high end as possible. Think if you were to train top athletes, celebrities, people that have enough money to not care how much they spend but they think about what they get. Each client pay enough so you dont need many, the ratio is up to you and your goals but value needs to match the price.\n\nThe other path is to have a system where more clients doesnt mean less time. Meaning if you had 100 clients, you would spend the same amount as 50. But this is not true coaching. This path you have some templates that match the clients goals, needs and wants. There 2 routes you can go here, either subscription based, one time buys. For subscription based you need a platform they like and \"depend\" on for their workout for example a platform with tracking, guides and logs. The one time buys, you have programs lasting 4-6 weeks for example for cutting or bulking. And a way to have them buying new products. So you add a new program for example every month. So if they liked the first one, they might try a new one after they are done. Or you can have different phases of programs like beginner, intermediate and advanced. Its basically up to you to make templates that covers everything you would want.\n\nI think you or the clients see your product as the first, but your trying to build the other types and its mixing which gives wrong signal to you and them. So it really depends on your goal and vision, just make it laser focused and make it clear what your aiming at instead of aiming it everywhere. Because it sounds like your hitting a little bit of everywhere and its barely making a dent",

It’s a software engineering thing, but the principle can be extrapolated into any sort of system design.

You end up managing integrations instead of managing your actual business.\n\nThe client who told you your messages feel like templates gave you the most valuable feedback you've gotten in months. That's worth more than any automation dashboard.\n\nOne thing that helped me break out of a similar loop: I started tracking how I spent each hour for a week. Not categories like \"marketing\" or \"operations\" - actual activities. \"Debugging Zapier flow\" vs \"having a conversation with a prospect.\" When I saw how little time went to the stuff that actually moved the needle, it was a wake-up call.\n\nYou clearly know what works (conversations, referrals, personal touch). The uncomfortable part is that those things don't scale the way we want them to, and they involve rejection. But at 28 clients, you don't need scale - you need depth.",
