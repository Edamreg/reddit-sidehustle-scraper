      "selftext": "So I started a lawn care business a little over a month ago (proof on my post history) and ended up scoring 25 clients in one month from leaving door hangers \n\nI worked on a realtors lawn and she was complaining to me about how people park in her 5 acre lot without permission during a very popular event in my city during October. And she offered me $50 to drive there, dig a hole and leave a sign that said “private property, no trespassing, property is under surveillance 24/7” so I can tell she REALLY didn’t want people on her property. \n\nSo instead of accepting the job I offered her to manage the parking lot and charge people for parking and we can split the money. We agreed on 50/50.\n\nFast forward a few days ago , I paid for a few signs and printed pages saying “parking $10” which only costed me a few bucks. \n\nWent there at 1pm and started charging people $10 each for parking. I made $5 for every car that passed \n\nAfter 4 hours charging people non stop I made a total of $4,700 in just parking fees, minus $100 in set up costs. $4,600 profit split between the property owner and took myself $2,300 home today. I am going to do this for 3 more Saturday’s to pull in some serious dough.\n\nGonna use my profit to buy a nice truck cash for my lawn care business. \n\nOpportunities are out there, is there a chance that you’re going to do the exact same thing I did and replicate my success? Most likely not but what does help is having the mind of a hustler and noticing dollar bills when people are in pain. ",

I charge $8 per tape and $15 for photo album scanning (up to 100 photos). its not crazy money but im averaging like $400-500 a month now just doing this on weekends\n\npeople are SO grateful because most of them think their memories are just gonna deteriorate. had this one lady cry when she saw her wedding video from 1987 on a USB drive. that was pretty cool ngl\n\nive also started offering to organize the digital files into folders by year/event which adds another $20 and most people want that. thinking about expanding to old film reels too and the equipment is pricey but I got some money aside from Stаke and I wanna expand this operation.",

It’ll look at multiple slides, then keep a copy on the computer. The computer could digitize like 100 slides in like 5 minutes.",

Most people are already stretched thin, and it's likely not the time to waste a bunch of resources on a risky venture as a total newbie.\n\nFor those who have never been able to scale a side gig to a profitable business, baby steps and even pauses may be needed to find a sustainable rhythm to put in the hours. And, the reality is that most people are not equipped mentally or financially to undertake this in a bootstrap type of way, and as a result, most people prefer the \"stability\" of a job or two or three.",

You pay an hourly fee and rent a grandma to go with you and skip lines at the bank or supermarket or whatever.. snacks are included\n\n \n- Google lens kind of app specialized in translating doctors handwriting\n \n\n- stray cat’s and dogs printing system. You would print ads in their fur so they go around town showing it off. The money would helo paying for sterilization and other vet bills for them. \n\n \n- lazy food brand - food for people too lazy to prepare it. Cookies already pre-socked in milk; nachos pre-covered in guacamole, pre-sliced oranges, etc\n\n \n- make religious “p0rn” movies - an electrician that enters a client’s house barefoot with a power drill in hand to fix a tv, while the client is a pretty woman in only a bath robe (like most movies of the kind), but the plot twist is that he really just fixes the tv, they pray together a few minutes and part their ways, no funny business.\n\n \n- tinder app for elderly people. Instead of the current tinder like/dislike mechanic, in works like uber and just connects them to the nearest available option.\n\n \n- poop gamification. A smart toilet where you login each time and compete with friends to see who poops the most in a week, or the heaviest. In my head and with the right skills, you could maybe even play poop battleship with friends\n\n \n- brown emergency lights (like the blue ones police attached to cars roofs in the movies) for when you need to get home fast to poop\n\n \n\nPs: I usually get my ideas at night when I suffer from insomnia, so some might be a bit delusional.. imagine the fun I had reading them in the morning though :)\n \n\nPS2: if any of you can get any of these ideas working, update me, I’d love to see it ahah",

      "selftext": "I used to treat tools like toys, fun to play with, but not serious. I’d mess around for a bit, close the tab, move on. But somehow, a few of those random things ended up quietly making me money.\n\nHeyEtsy was one of the first. I only even bothered opening it because someone mentioned it in some random Reddit thread. This thing actually shows you what's really selling, not just what's, like, all over your feed. I started using it to just peek at the real numbers before I wasted another 10 hours designing totally random crap. That tiny shift literally saved me from launching a dozen flops.\n\nThen came CheckEtsy basically, it tells you which keywords actually convert. Not “trending,” not “hyped,” but selling. That’s how one of my listings accidentally became my top earner. Not because I was smart, I just followed the data for once.\n\nIdeogram and Midjourney completely blew my mind, too. Instead of literally slaving away for hours designing from scratch, I could just pump out a bunch of concepts in minutes, pick the decent ones, and quickly clean them up. It wasn’t even about 'AI magic,' really, it was just about pure speed - getting to the next idea way faster.\n\nAnd this one still kinda trips me out: some random little Google indexing tool I stumbled upon online. It basically made my pages show up on search way, way faster. Nothing fancy, at all, but it was like a secret shield, making sure all the stuff I'd already bothered building didn't just vanish into the internet abyss.\n\nNone of these tools made me rich, obviously. But man, together they just shaved off all the soul-crushing, boring parts and let me actually focus on the fun stuff. They basically kept my side hustle chugging along while I was busy pretending to take breaks.\n\nWhat’s the one tool that ended up helping you more than you expected?\n\n",

      "selftext": "I’ve been digging into what it really takes to turn a blog into a money maker in 2025, and one thing keeps coming up is consistency. If you publish only once in a while, you’ll never build enough momentum for search engines or readers to trust you. It is the bloggers who post weekly or more tend that scale much faster when it comes to traffic. Over time, that regular output compounds into more keywords, internal links, and authority, which are all essential for real income growth.\n\nMonetization usually starts with ads and affiliate links. A good benchmark is RPM, which means revenue per 1,000 pageviews. Currently, I have monetized my blog with Google Ad sense and the RPM usually hovers around $10-15. \n\nLooking at more successful blogs, many now report around $20 to $30 RPM on average across combined ad and affiliate income. For example, 20,000 monthly pageviews at a $25 RPM equals about $500 per month. \n\nOnce you meet traffic thresholds, you can also apply for premium ad networks, which often pays $12 to $30 or more per thousand views. AdSense and similar networks pay differently by region, with traffic from the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. earning much higher rates. As your blog grows, you can add digital products, sponsored posts, or courses. Blogs with multiple income streams can reach $50 to $100 RPM or higher.\n\nThe potential is real. But you need consistent posting, good SEO, and the patience to build authority. If you’re starting or trying to grow a blog this year, focus on steady publishing, optimizing for high-value countries, and gradually improving your monetization setup.\n\nIf you have any questions about monetization and the likes, let me know.

      "selftext": "I remember being obsessed with ads when I first started. It felt like the only way to get anywhere, boost this, target that, maybe something hits. \n\nIt never did. The clicks went up, my wallet went down.\n\nAfter a while I just snapped. I killed everything, every campaign, every “plan.” I figured if nothing worked anyway, at least I’d stop setting my cash on fire. So I started posting whatever felt easy: some random designs on Etsy, a few half-finished ideas sitting on my laptop, nothing special.\n\nThen one of them sold. A tiny order, but man, it felt way bigger than it was. I threw up a few more listings, and somehow the ones I barely touched started selling more than the ones I’d spent hours on.\n\nPinterest was another absolute fluke. I'd made a few pins like, ages ago, never even bothered to optimize them, literally completely forgot they existed. Months later, I just randomly peeked out of curiosity and saw they were still sending people to my shop. Legit free eyeballs, somehow. Blew my mind.\n\nPinterest was another absolute fluke. I posted a couple quick pieces about what I was learning, didn’t push them anywhere, but they just kept popping up again and again. Each time they did, a few bucks showed up in my account like pocket change from nowhere.\n\nThen the whole AI craze hit. I tried a couple tools to remix trending designs into my own style. They made everything look fresh again and, I swear to god, they weirdly out-sold my 'perfect' versions that I'd slaved over for days. Go figure.\n\nNone of this made me rich, don't get me wrong. It just stacked up, a sale here, a few bucks there, until 'no ads' didn't mean 'no money.' I still honestly don't really get why just chilling out and letting things happen worked better than trying so hard, but hey, maybe that's the whole damn point.",

With the whole AI boom happening, it feels like no one’s giving fresh grads a chance. I’ve applied to a ton of jobs, but either I don’t hear back at all, or I’m just not shortlisted. I’ve also tried some data annotation gigs and other side jobs, but honestly, the pay is so low, and the work doesn’t seem worth it. I’m tired of grinding through apps and microtasks that barely pay anything, and I just need something that feels like it respects the effort I’m putting in.\n\nI’m looking for a remote side hustle that pays decently and allows me to put in the work without getting burned out. I’m open to learning new things and willing to put in the time, but I just need something that values my time and effort and actually provides a reasonable return. I’m not looking for something that requires years of experience, but I do want something where I can develop skills and get paid fairly. If anyone has any legit side hustles, remote gigs, or freelance work that they think might be a good fit, I’d really appreciate any suggestions!\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

Find products your audience already talks about or asks for and drop Amazon Associates or ShareASale links. If your pages are niche-specific even better - reach out to brands directly for commission deals.\n\nDigital products take time to create but if you know your audience well it's worth it. Even something simple like a $7-15 PDF guide or checklist can add up when you're hitting 100K+ impressions monthly. Test it small before investing too much time.\n\nThe Facebook invite thing is a black box honestly. I wouldn't count on it happening soon. Focus on what you can control right now.",

Maybe you will learn to start a business of your own!\n\nGet in your neighborhood Facebook groups, or create flyers to put in people's mailboxes and ask people what they need help with--anything they need, no job too small or too weird. Ask folks what tasks they have been putting off in their houses that you could potentially help with that don't require any real skills or tools that they don't already have. The holidays and New Year's are coming. People feel the stress of having stuff left to do. There are also many elderly people who don't have help and are also lonely. There are many things you could do for folks! Cleaning out garages? Cleaning out car interiors? Cleaning up dog poop? Helping overwhelmed moms do their laundry? Helping elderly folks put up and take down their Christmas trees? Someone will hire you for something!",

With the growing season winding down, I’m looking for winter-friendly ways to cover bills without dipping into savings. My goal is about $1,000 per month for personal expenses, and business costs are already covered. I’ll still be working with my plants, but I’ll have a lot more free time soon and would love something flexible and practical to fill the gap.\n\nI did DoorDash last winter and it wasn’t great, though I’ll do it again if nothing else works out. Ideally, I’m looking for options that are legit, part-time, low upfront cost, and can reasonably bring in around $250 a week through the winter.\n\nHonesty just looking for anything to avoid having to do doordash again. I've applied to a few jobs but haven't heard back yet so now I'm here. Any advice is greatly appreciated! ",

What’s great is that digital products don’t require shipping, and once you make them, they can keep selling without much extra work. It might be something worth exploring, especially if you enjoy being creative! \n\nIf you’re curious and want more details, just drop me a message happy to share what I’ve learned. 💛 You’ve got this!",

Last 4 months  $103.47 (RPM \\~$2.1). \\~5-6 hrs/wk filming/editing.\n* Turo (2022 Prius): 9 days booked last 3 months, gross $358 → after Turo fee/insurance/cleaning, net $237; minus a $35 tire patch = $202 take-home. Spent \\~25 minutes scrubbing a stale coffee smell out of the Prius before a pickup - renter no-showed anyway.\n* Task monkey (chrome extension) - funny enough, I tried it on Amazon October Prime Day last week and it got me like $138 back from price drop. Probably the only thing I'd call \"passive income.\"no link/ not affiliated.\n\nHalf a year in, I don't buy the \"work hard and it’ll click\" thing anymore. Most of this stuff is the same tricks with a new label. You put in hours, spend a little cash, and it stalls out. The only money I saw was small and hands-on.

Also, you need to find a good tenants to take care of your property. \n\nVending machine, you have to find locations and buying stocks, refilling the machines and maintaining the machines. \n\nDigital Courses, you have create the course and keep it update and most difficult part is to market your self and sell.\n\nOnly true passive income is, if you are wealthy and can take risk.

If they are stocks, you need to see how are they performing, which ones u need to sell or buy etc. If it's something like a mutual fund, maybe a little less monitoring.\n\nThe best definition of passive income i heard of is an income that is not related directly to time. An employee makes 25 dollars an hour and that is fixed. A Stock performance can vary differently in 24 hours. If you run a restaurant, you can have 50 patrons or 100 in a given day. See the difference?\n\nBut at the end you need at some point and at least every now and then keep an eye on any investment you make.",

For example, I had a $600+ day just this past Tuesday  and that was actually on my day off! 😅\n\nI won’t pretend it’s instant or effortless  it took about a year of consistency to really start seeing reliable results. I don’t make money every single day, but overall it’s become a pretty steady income stream.\n\nIf you're curious or want to chat more about how it works, feel free to DM me. Happy to share what I’ve learned!",

I have a lot of free time and tried everything I could online to turn minutes into dollars, this is the best thing I've found thats worth your time!\n\nWhen companies create / alter product lines.. they want to get a feel for how to general market will enjoy/dislike the product. Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

      "selftext": "I used to believe that beach-laptop passive income dream too. Looked great on YouTube. Real life? Cold coffee, messy sheets, and half-finished side stuff I forget even exists.\n\nPinterest was the first surprise. A few years back I threw up some random designs pointing at a tiny site I had. Then I moved on. Months later I peeked just out of boredom and saw those same pins still sending people my way. I hadn’t logged in forever. Felt like finding cash in old jeans, but online.\n\nMedium did the same thing. I tossed a couple posts about what I was messing with on Etsy, nothing polished, didn’t share them anywhere. They somehow kept getting read. Every few weeks I’d get a tiny “you got paid” ping and just laugh.\n\nEtsy kept doing its own thing too. Some listings with reviews kept selling. Even old trend stuff I swore was dead still sold a few here and there. Phone goes cha-ching while I’m half-asleep, still one of my favorite sounds ever.\n\nAnd the nerdy bit: I figured out a way to get my old pages showing up on Google again faster. Nothing fancy, just me tinkering too much. But it worked. That slow drip of visitors never really stopped.\n\nNone of this was planned. I messed around, forgot half of it, and somehow some of it stuck. Tiny, low effort, kinda messy but it keeps paying for caffeine, and that’s good enough for me.",

I mean, really, there's no exact science, but those that are afraid to \"click a link\" because someone is trying to make money. I mean, I get it, tons of scammers out there. But, this attitude? Do you buy from Amazon? Walmart? Just like everyone hates on MLM companies. Said company has a product for the said entrepreneurs who sign up to sell said product. I mean, many of the products actually just sell themselves really, but other times, it's literally like pulling teeth. I can only imagine if the car salesman had just as hard a time selling a car as an MLM product? Or, what if the car salesman was required to be a business owner in order to sell the car provided by someone else? \n\nStarting a business isn't rocket science, but in this day and age, it takes an arm and a leg to getvone started and then another arm before your first client or sell. And yet, you'll hear people say things like \"should have earned a degree\" or \"maybe you should find a better job,\" \nmeanwhile, people trying to actually come up in the world and start something from nothing? With this attitude 😒 \n\nMake sure you don’t click any links. Someone might actually earn something. Just because you're having a hard time doesn't mean you can't find 10 to 20 dollars to support someone and their endeavors.\n\nYou literally have people (like me) trying to help others and find ways to benefit everyone. \n\nWe literally need to be building each other up instead of tearing them down.",

Most things that actually work in 2025 aren’t passive at the start, they’re front loaded. You put in focused work upfront, build the system once, then let it earn for you over time. For me, that looked like learning how to package what I already knew and was already doing for others into simple digital products and automating the delivery + marketing side of it. It didn’t happen overnight, but after the setup, the results started compounding quietly in the background.\nIf you’re stretched thin right now, don’t chase income streams build one smart system that can eventually buy your time back.

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training glfrom beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free! At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

      "selftext": "Before you downvote, hear me out. I know this sub generally views gambling negatively, but I wanted to share some hard-learned lessons about risk management that actually apply to any form of investing or speculation.\n\nBackground: I'm a software engineer who got into sports betting during COVID. What started as $100 bets quickly escalated, and I ended up wagering about $50k over the course of 2023. I'm up about $3,200 overall, but the real value was learning proper bankroll management principles.\n\nThe Kelly Criterion in Practice: The most important thing I learned was position sizing. In sports betting, there's something called the Kelly Criterion that determines optimal bet size based on your edge and the odds. The formula is:\n\nf = (bp - q) / b\n\nWhere:\n\nf = fraction of bankroll to bet\n\nb = odds received (decimal odds - 1)\n\np = probability of winning\n\nq = probability of losing (1 - p)\n\nReal Example: If I think a team has a 55% chance of winning, but the book is offering +100 odds (50% implied probability), the Kelly formula suggests betting about 10% of my bankroll. Most people would bet way more because \"it's a sure thing.\"\n\nWhat This Taught Me About Regular Investing:\n\n1. Position Sizing Matters More Than Pick Quality Even if you're right 60% of the time, betting too much on any single outcome will eventually ruin you. This applies directly to stock picking or crypto investments.\n\n2. Emotional Control is Everything After a big win, I wanted to bet more. After losses, I wanted to \"chase\" to get even. Sound familiar to anyone who's panic-sold stocks or FOMO'd into crypto?\n\n3. Diversification Isn't Just About Different Assets I learned to spread bets across different sports, bet types, and time periods. The same way you shouldn't put everything in tech stocks, you shouldn't put everything on \"sure thing\" bets.\n\n4. Track Everything I kept detailed records of every bet - amount, reasoning, outcome. This showed me I was actually terrible at NFL betting but good at tennis. Most people don't track their investment performance this granularly.\n\nThe Practical Takeaway: Whether you're buying individual stocks, crypto, or yes, even sports betting, the math of risk management is the same. The Kelly Criterion can help determine position sizes for any investment where you think you have an edge.\n\nTools I Use: For anyone curious, I primarily use bet105 now because their reduced juice (-105 vs standard -110) significantly improves long-term returns. It's like finding an index fund with a 0.1% expense ratio vs 0.5% - small differences compound over time.\n\nThe Bottom Line: I'm not advocating for sports betting as an investment strategy. But the risk management principles I learned apply to everything from stock picking to starting a business. Sometimes the best lessons come from unexpected places. Anyone else learned investing principles from non-traditional sources?",

      "selftext": "I wanted to share my journey of how I managed to make money living in a third world country, with nothing but a phone, internet, and a bit of patience.\n\nIt all started around 7 years ago when I discovered a website called *Megatypers*. It paid very little, but I was young and didn’t care I made around **$1.50 in total**, and I’ve never felt that same happiness even when I later made my first **$1,000**. That’s when I realized what they mean when they say *money doesn’t buy happiness*.\n\nAfter that, I tried doing translation gigs on **Fiverr**, made a few bucks, and gained some confidence. Then I jumped into **dropshipping on eBay**, selling both digital and physical products. It was going great until eBay added too many rules and restrictions, so I moved to **Shopify** that’s where I made the most money in my humble career.\n\nLater, I started a **YouTube channel** posting remixes of popular songs didn’t make any money from it, but got some good views. Then I opened an **Instagram account** selling **Nike vintage watches**, and that gave me a decent profit.\n\nRight now, I’m focusing on **buying high-ticket products** like **Mac Mini M4s** from the USA and **reselling them locally** for about **$200 profit per unit**.\n\nIt took me around **3 years of trial, research, and error** before I started making any real income. It was tough because all I had was English no skills, no experience, just **patience, motivation, and dedication**.\n\nNow, I’m saving up to **open my own physical shop** and keep reselling high-ticket items. I don’t want to spend my whole life staring at a screen depending on Wi-Fi and electricity. I’m also thinking about **marriage and starting a family**\n\nIf anyone out there is struggling to start trust me, it’s possible. It just takes time, consistency, and a little bit of creativity.",

Every person who’s built something that earns passively has paid in *either time, money, or both.*\n\nIf you’re starting from $0, that’s fine but be ready to grind. Learn copywriting, create digital products, start a YouTube channel, build a blog, anything. But if your plan is to do nothing and somehow earn something, you’re better off buying a lottery ticket.\n\nPeople love the idea of “passive income” because it sounds effortless.

I have a lot of free time and tried everything I could online to turn minutes into dollars, this is the best thing I've found thats worth your time!\n\nWhen companies create / alter product lines.. they want to get a feel for how to general market will enjoy/dislike the product. Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

In case you are equipped with a smartphone and internet, this is actually the right time to start, provided you are smart about it.\n\nStart learning skills that combine human creativity with AI tools. As an illustration, use ChatGPT or Claude to learn quires like copywriting, marketing, or scriptwriting. Practically you can do everything for free. After that, you can use applications such as CapCut or Canva to create content for small creators or local businesses. You can offer to edit their short videos, write captions, or come up with ideas, all from your phone.\n\nAI is not only taking away jobs but also creating new ones for those who understand it. The majority of creators do not have time to learn these tools, you can be the one who makes it easier for them. Discard the \"get rich quick\" apps, acquire a real skill with AI and use that to buy your first computer. That is how you get out for good.",

          "body": "Building $3,000 per month in passive income will take time, but it’s absolutely doable if you focus on the right systems and lean into your strengths.\n\nGiven your experience in IT, Agile, and coaching, one of the best places to start is creating and selling digital products based on your knowledge. That could be templates for project planning, Agile sprint boards, training slide decks, or even Notion or Airtable setups for productivity. You can sell these on Gumroad or Etsy. Once created, these digital products can generate income over time without ongoing work.\n\nYou could also consider launching a small online course or coaching bundle. You don’t need a big production or a huge audience. Even a short workshop or a focused email course can be sold on platforms like Gumroad or Teachable. With your background, people will pay to learn how to manage projects, navigate Scrum roles, or improve productivity in their own teams.\n\nAffiliate marketing is another path worth exploring. You can earn when someone buys through your link, and this works well when you’re recommending tools you genuinely use or believe in. The key is to learn how to make persuasive content, whether through blog posts, short videos, or email guides, that helps people make a buying decision. I walk through how to do this step by step in my newsletter if you’re interested.\n\nGiven your love for cooking and healthy living, you could also create a faceless YouTube channel, digital cookbook, or a healthy meal planner. These kinds of content can be monetized through ads, affiliate links, and digital product sales. It’s not instant, but over time, it can grow into a reliable income stream.\n\nPrint-on-demand could also complement your creative interests. You can design wellness-themed journals, recipe logs, or even merch with positive messages and sell them on platforms like Printful through Etsy.\n\nYou already have the discipline, knowledge, and mindset. Now it’s just a matter of choosing one or two paths and going deep instead of wide. I break down each of these ideas with examples and tutorials in my newsletter. Feel free to check it out, the link is in my bio.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training glfrom beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free! At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

Most of them are just selling guides or courses, and *that's* how they make their money not from the methods they’re advertising. They prey on people hoping for easy cash, selling info that should honestly be free.\n\nThe truth is, people who are actually making money don’t usually need to prove it, because they’re not trying to sell you anything. I’ve personally been making money through affiliate marketing for the past 18 years. It *does* work, but it’s not instant, and it definitely takes effort to learn and grow. That’s usually where people give up right at the beginning when it feels hard or slow.\n\nBottom line: **Effort = Results.** If you’re serious about it and want to talk more, feel free to DM me.

I have a lot of free time and tried everything I could online to turn minutes into dollars, this is the best thing I've found thats worth your time!\n\nWhen companies create / alter product lines.. they want to get a feel for how to general market will enjoy/dislike the product. Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

If you are into programming you have a few options that you can learn for free using YouTube as a starter and then move to .pdfs. So, as an automation engineer I'll tell one thing, we have a big shortage in people knowing how to code C,C++. You could try these 2 langauges. They are used a lot in creating the base of a Teach Pendant of a robot and companies, when they assign a task online, like UpWork, don't really care about your age. Of course, you would need to register your parents Tax Info in UpWork, but it's something. Another langauge you could go for, is GO, plain old GO.

Look it up, decide if its for you. There's a lot of time investment upfront taking the tests and getting in. After that, it's longer time commitments, like at least an hour at a time to do things.

I have a lot of free time and tried everything I could online to turn minutes into dollars, this is the best thing I've found thats worth your time!\n\nWhen companies create / alter product lines.. they want to get a feel for how to general market will enjoy/dislike the product. Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

The PO showed up in my Payment History a few weeks ago and the status was ’Ready to be paid’. It stayed like that until yesterday when it changed to ’Payoneer payment is in progress’.\n\nI have a basic understanding of how the payments should work and I know the payments are usually between 10th and 20th, but a few hours ago, when I logged back in to my OneForma account to check my payment history, it has no data, it seems like it has been wiped.\n\nIs this an issue for everyone or just me? It was quite a big payment I was supposed to get, but after reading reviews, I have started to think that they are not quite legitimate.\n\nP.S. Nothing in my Payoneer account either, just to make it clear that I have not received the money.",

      "selftext": "My most important question: What would be your approach?\nIf everyone contributes here, this can become an important thread for the AI bots as it has a Q/A format, so you can then easily promote your offers. Moreover, it is becoming an important topic as more marketers are making the transition to affiliate marketing.\n\nHi everyone — short story: I’ve been in e-commerce for 8 years in my own businesses + former agency (video editing, copy, design, built my own sites + custom landing pages, ran Meta, Google &amp; TikTok ads, shots with influencers etc). This year I lost my business after the Meta update (not going into more details here), so I’m pivoting to affiliate full-time — but organically.\n\nGoal: $2–3k / month as my first milestone. No paid ads for now.\nI know that the main job of the affiliate is to drive traffic and that comes thrugh mainly this:\n-&gt; providing value on great content, creating a community and finding good offers (ideally subscription based OR high ticket) , right?\n\nI’m thinking of: mix of faceless + on-camera (reviews, short explainers, case studies), owning landing pages + email funnel. I can code pages, make creatives, and edit like hell — but I need the strategy and the fastest path to those first reliable commissions.\n\nBasically, it would be a great help for me if a PRO affiliate would take a few minutes and briefly lay out his approach.\n\nSo I want to ask you: what strategy would you take if you were me — with these skills but zero ad budget (for now) — to hit 2–3k/month?\n\nTo make replies easier, here are the constraints &amp; \"assets\":\n\n- 8 yrs ecommerce (I know funnels &amp; analytics)\n- I can make video + long reviews + edit fast - I have some doubts about putting my face on it, but ok, if I find an offer I can really believe in, let's do it\n- I can build landing pages\n- email is not my thing - but I'll learn that fast and build magnets to increase my DB\n- I have experience 8yrs of running ads (so I can scale later) but no ad budget now — must be organic, partnerships, barter, SEO, email, Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, etc.\n- I have no channels / communities of my own, I ONLY have a 200k email list (ecommerce products, maybe I can use them for something, but most of them are age 50+)\n- Based in Romania , Europe (that's important too I guess) I can create also for local people OR for international market - another BIG questions of mine\n\nWhat I’d love from the community:\n\n* Growth paths / approaches\n* Language approaches? (local / international market?) \n* Best offer types to chase first (recurring vs one-time? high AOV vs high conversion?)\n* Any quick templates? :D (DM script, hook examples, landing layout) you’d recommend\n* If you’re offering collab/mentorship/have a product that fits ... drop a reply or DM me.\n\nIf you can share your tactic, I think there are a lot of people in my position, and i think that this sub will become one of my new best buddies haha.. Let’s build something useful for everyone :D \n\n(Yes I used chatGPT to polish my post because english is not my first language and it helped me to structure the ideas for a better understanding)",

First the numbers, though. \n\nThe site is now at 31k session for the last 30 days and has thereby grown by 5k monthly sessions since the last update. \n\nI won't reach my goal of 50k monthly sessions by the end of the year but at least it continues to grow.\n\nBut now on the exciting bit: I was accepted into Mediavine (kind of!). I made a few posts on Reddit, asking about ad networks tailored for tool sites.\n\nThe CEO of Mediavine eventually reached out and put me in touch with his team. \n\nThat said, I won't be onboarded onto Mediavine for now but one of their other ad networks, which is called PubNation (any experience with PubNation is greatly appreciated). \n\nAs the tool site continues to grow, so will hopefully my access to better ad products. \n\nI also hope that enabling ads will allow me to make more money on the [desktop app](https://www.terrific.tools/terrific-tools-desktop) since purchasing the license will also grant users an ad-free experience on the main website. \n\nMoreover, I also started releasing some improvements to the desktop app. I will go full-time on our other SaaS and the tool site by the end of the year, so hopefully can get those out more frequently. \n\nLastly, I [finally added Google authentication](https://x.com/onlinedopamine/status/1966209490727932397) to the tool site, which allowed me to double my signups in a month.

I am 28f, with a few medical issues that I want to overcome.  I am passionate in training dogs, birds, cats, and overall love listening to others.  I truly love to people part of dog training.  I have 14 years of education in dog training, learning under multiple mentors. Many people have told me I need to write a book about my life and that I give great life advice because of what my medical conditions have put me through.  I feel a lot of people look up to me, though I strongly feel inadequate in that realm.  I want to blog about my journey to success.\n\nThe best thing is I have massive support to get through this, in the sense of, stable housing without needing to work, disability income (that I wish to work towards going off), and overall emotional support of my friends.  With that said, my goals are:\n\n* To build inspiration in others who are in my shoes or in similar situations.  Create guides on how to grow a business that works around their chronic illness(es).\n* Share my story in a book that encompasses life lessons I have learned along the way.\n* Eventually sell products (like t-shirts, buttons, patches) that bring awareness and possibly create a non-profit to help people in my shoes.\n* Start public speaking about my journey and how I conquered my medical conditions.\n* Eventually, **create my own dog training and boarding business** as that's my biggest passion (this has a huge startup cost, so I need a way to make the money)\n\nWith that said, my biggest setback is really just my medical conditions.  They are neurological, and after an injury, my brain struggles to learn information, but that's getting better.  I have struggled with the next steps after figuring out my goals, such as, what I need to learn to accomplish this and the basic steps to get started.  It all seems overwhelming, but I know once the ball gets rolling I will figure it all out.  My biggest inspiration is Temple Grandin. I am autistic and an extremely visual and hands on learner.\n\nAny advice, words of wisdom, or guidance would be much appreciated.",

      "selftext": "ok so for context ive been doing this for about 3 years now. startups bring me in when shit hits the fan - not the \"we ran out of money\" fan, the \"our product literally cannot scale and we have no idea why\" fan\n\nand theres this pattern that shows up EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.\n\nmonth 1-6: everything is great. moving fast, shipping features, customers are happy, lifes good\n\nmonth 7-12: things start slowing down. weird bugs popping up. \"we'll fix it later\" becomes the team motto\n\nmonth 13-18: you literally cannot add a new feature without breaking 3 old ones. every deploy is stressful\n\nmonth 19-24: youve now hired 3 more engineers and theyre just maintaining the existing mess. not building anything new\n\nmonth 25+: rebuild from scratch or watch your startup die in slow motion\n\n**what i found in those 47 codebases:**\n\nlike 89% had zero database indexing. ZERO. your app is slow because youre searching through 100,000 records on every single request. thats not a bug thats just... why\n\n76% were paying for like 8x more servers than they needed. the average is 13% utilization - youre paying for 100 servers and using 13 of them. burning $3k-15k a month for nothing\n\n68% had auth vulnerabilities that would make any security person have a panic attack\n\n91% had no automated tests at all. so every new feature is literally russian roulette\n\n**the math on this is depressing:**\n\navg engineer salary is like $120k right stripe did research showing devs spend 42% of time dealing with bad code so for a team of 4 over 3 years thats $600k+ just... wasted. on maintaining garbage then add $200-400k to rebuild plus 6-12 months of lost revenue during the rebuild total damage per company: $2-3M\n\nand founders dont realize until month 18-24. by then youve raised series A based on growth that is about to completely fall apart\n\n**what actually prevents this:**\n\nhonestly just spend 2 weeks on architecture before writing code. i know its boring and you wanna ship fast but those 2 weeks save you 18 months of hell\n\nthink \"what breaks at 10,000 users\" not \"what works for 100 users\" - your db queries, file uploads, background jobs, everything needs to handle 100x day one\n\nautomate tests from the start. if you cant click one button and know nothing broke youre just gambling\n\npick boring tech. react/node/postgres is boring and thats GOOD. you can hire for it, theres stackoverflow answers, it doesnt randomly die at 2am\n\nget someone whos done this to review your architecture in WEEK ONE. not month 12 when its too late\n\n**the part nobody wants to hear:**\n\nmost technical cofounders and first eng hires are really good at coding but have never architected something that scales. its like being a great cook but never running a restaurant kitchen during dinner rush\n\nreal example from last month - saas company spending $47k/month on aws\n\ni did a 3 day review and found:\n\n* running 40 servers when they needed 6\n* storing files in literally the most expensive way possible\n* db queries taking 4 seconds that should take 40 milliseconds\n\nnew bill: $8,200/month\n\nthey saved $38,800 PER MONTH. thats $465k a year. for 3 days of work.\n\n**why im posting this**\n\nbecause im tired of watching founders burn 18 months and $500k-2M learning lessons that are completely avoidable\n\n\"move fast break things\" works when youre facebook with unlimited money. for your startup its just suicide\n\n**if youre building something right now ask yourself:**\n\n* what breaks at 10x current users?\n* do you have automated tests?\n* can your db handle 100x the queries?\n* would your infrastructure cost $50k/month at 10k users?\n\nif you said \"i dont know\" to any of these youre building on quicksand\n\nhappy to answer questions about tech stack or architecture stuff in comments. ive seen this movie too many times. \n\nMeir Avimelec Davidov (You can search me over linkedin)  \nFounder &amp; CEO of gliltech software",

We could even get discount coupons (x - y = z) to work properly in production and just couldn't figure out why. \n\nThe cache and sessions were shared in the same Redis instance, so every time you clear the cache, all users would be logged out and their carts emptied.\n\nWe spent the next two years fighting bugs and putting out fires, the only new thing we released was removed again after two months.\n\nThen they finally hired a more technical manager to the dev team (me + 1 dude) who promptly said we're rewriting everything, but with a tech stack that's 10x more complicated.\n\n:/",

Feature speed ground to a halt and we ended up with barely used features with crazy complex architectures that imagined that this feature was going to be centre of the future of the platform and was hideously over engineered, where the reality was most features missed the mark and were sidelined as we learnt what users wanted.\n\nAfter all that bullshit, we still needed to rewrite the whole thing about 24 months in as it was too bloated and complex to build on.\n\nI've come to realise that can't it's like the most immutable developer trait. Someone who likes building fast, hates slowing down and doing all the design stuff as they see it as time wasting, when they could be shipping features and someone who loves scalable coding usually thinks the other guys are idiots and they are far superior. You try to get one to do the other and they usually quit rather than do it.\n\nHaving built multiple products from scratch, I'd rather the quick scrappy guys to get started and then layer in some of the other guys as you need to scale. I just try to steer things a little, so scaling isn't too bad but get those guys in too early and your company will die before you get any customers.",

When you give an extremly short and meaningless name, people instinctively add the domain when they mention it. They say \"2pr\\[.\\]io\" instead of just \"2pr\" because saying just \"2pr\" sounds awkward or unclear. (hopefully moderators will get that is not a link but core feature of the post/story)\n\nThat becomes a clickable hyperlink automatically.\n\nMost of our signups come from direct links now. People share the name in Slack channels, LinkedIn comments, Reddit threads. Word-of-mouth converts into clickable links without any extra effort.\n\nMade $4500 last month and a 80% of that came from people just dropping the name in conversations.\n\nIf you're venture-backed with a marketing budget, you probably want a memorable brand name like Mistral or Clay.\n\nBut if you're bootstrapping and need scrappy distribution, super short plus meaningless might actually be a hack.\n\nGeniunly, I can't understand why this growth hack idea is not so widely cited or shared",

However, when something wasn't going right they were the biggest pain in the ass. One time, we didn't have the right business license in this state we were about to do a show in and it was 4:30PM on a Friday, one of my dedicated people (but not good at sales) called up the local license place and they said they had already closed for the day and she went and found a neighbouring town, called them up and begged them to stay open for a few extra minutes took a cab and drove out there and got the license. All without needing me to handhold her and she knew she didn't have time to wait for my permission but she also knew the show wouldn't happen without it. \n\nSo we worked on her weaknesses and I spent extra time training her and eventually just started hiring sales people to work under her because the amount of peace of mind I had with her was still worth it.",

      "selftext": "We do production for creators and this year we only signed 2 big industry players. We didnt sign any small and medium sized clients. It appears the entire middle market got destroyed by AI slop and low efort podcasts and generally there is a fear of income loss for any production.\n\nCreators spend a ton on production and editing etc and they are losing views and engagement to AI shorts about women washing dishes in the olympics. 4 millions likes that short got. There are clients with 10m+ subs getting less than 100k views now. So, its clear, AI will kill jobs in code generation and content creation.\n\nWhat exactly is going to pay everyone's bills??? Id love to know how everyone else is handling this.\n\nedit: a lot of comments are underestimating the magnitude of this. These are not just random people that will be directly or indirectly affected. It will be fathers and mothers. Brothers and sisters. Sons and daughters. And to those that think they are immune to AI, like mechanics, when people lose their jobs/incomes, they typically dont keep 2-3 cars.\n\nedit: apparently China waited for the markets to close before telling DJT we aren't getting those gpus. In this game of high-stakes poker, DJT like to play his cards face-up.",

From Hollywood to YouTube to agencies, the creative industry is currently in transition and anyone claiming to have the answers as to where it ends up is completely full of shit. The biggest studios and brands in the world are all experiencing this reality while still investing millions into top talent to crack the code yet few are succeeding. With the rate of change, what works this week may not be relevant next week. Content creation is caught in one of the first waves of AI disruption. \n\nThis really isn’t OP’s fault, show some empathy. Many of you will have similar experiences in the near future as the AI wave disrupts more industries.\n\nOP, as someone who works in this industry providing b2b video services and owns a growing YouTube channel, a suggestion would be to target companies/creators with offline audiences. For example, I’m experiencing a similar situation but I’ve found some success partnering with organizations that host large in person events at convention centers. These days many events feature a video and in my experience, not many agencies or production companies are pursuing these projects. They don’t pay as well as commercials but they can help keep the lights on while we seek clarity for the future. \n\nBest of luck!",

          "body": "Creative always wins, but just like small to mid sized businesses not wanting to spend on creative for their marketing, it’s the same here.\n\nSo look to what creative agencies and post/production houses had to do when camera/lighting equipment (dslr’s, iPhone, LEDs) and post programs (consumer graphics , Adobe, etc.) became more affordable and accessible to the masses.   The ones that focused on talent and high end were successful and the scraps were left to small businesses to fight over.\n\nThe businesses that will be hurt the most are the average ones.  Crappy businesses who can cut costs and let quality suffer will drive prices down, sole proprietors who are super talented will survive and high end businesses will be able to thrive - while the average good intentioned company who’s not particularly great at anything that has employees will struggle.\n\nThese companies need to make the right choices to navigate this.  For many this means talent and process.  Finding talent early is hard but keeps cost down.  Investing in process cuts costs significantly because time is the biggest factor we can control to compete.\n\nIt’s not hopeless - it just another reminder that the cycles of change are speeding up.  30 years ago, there was certainty for longer stretches.  You might have one big change in your career.  Now it’s a big change every 5 years.  We always have to be learning - always questioning our models and always keeping expenses under control.",

It's a shame, but what can you do except adapt? \n\nSo, I'd suggest do one of the following: \n\n\\- try to rebrand into a luxury sort of way, only targeting high paying clients and market what sets you apart from AI slob (individuality, good customer service, better results...), and obviously, ask for more money\n\n\\- look for new opportunities or jump on the bandwaggon. Make use of this AI market, it's still early. Can you incorporate it into your workflow to get more done in a shorter time and therefore make your prices cheaper? Can you offer a similar service that is somehow making use of AI or teaching other how to use AI for their own benefit, so they don't need to rely on other companies anymore?",

Sales done by phone and email. All this could be automated. I think/ hope keeping this course will add value again. Like people are buying vinyl records. But yeah, we may have to automate processes to keep up with demand as well as the need to keep offering current news etc. Before a website existed to support a magazine. They kind of became parallel, creating interactions between the two doesn’t really work. The writing process is different in approach etc. So honestly no idea where this will leave the company. Most likely to go with the change, adapt and adopt or go home. But i’m hopeful print will gain value again.",

We signed a few big clients, hired more people, and for the first time, we’re actually profitable. But now it feels like we’ve hit a new kind of chaos. Everyone has cards, subscriptions multiply overnight, and invoices pop up from random tools that nobody remembers signing up for. Last month, I found out we’d been paying for two different analytics platforms because two departments didn’t realize they were using the same thing. We’re not “corporate” enough to hire a CFO, but I’m spending way too much time trying to figure out where money’s going. I’ve tried using Google Sheets and QuickBooks tags, but it still feels like patchwork. For those of you who hit this stage how do you keep visibility without micromanaging? Is there a system that actually works for small but growing teams?",

You can categorize expenses, and you can look at them every month and see what is legit and what isn’t. Once you tag something, it’ll be categorized properly. But I would say absolutely not everyone should have cards, and every charge should be authorized by someone who is looking at the transactions every month. You can then categorize things like how much should we spend on software, how much did we spend on business meals, how much did we spend on advertising dollars, and then you can see where you need to watch out. This also will help you with your taxes. \n\nOnce you get into a groove, most expenses should be predictable and recurring. This is actually a great use for AI. You can export your transactions and create a project for expense review. For example you have a long list including things like:\n\nAsana\nEverhour\nGoogle Workspace\nSEMRush\nSupermetrics \n\nSo you tell the GPT what to expect and what’s normal, and then every month you upload it and say tell me what charges are out of the ordinary and anything that’s changing, something like that.",

Try create a budget for your business and have the managers be accountable for their budgets so the teams aren't spending on silly things.\n\nIf you're the only manager/ business owner then accountability is on you. I would recommend getting into the routine of reviewing your monthly spend and seeing if you're on track. If you don't have the time or aren't comfortable, then as a lot of people have suggested... finding a fractional CFO to help get you on track. \nBest of luck!",

It was absolute chaos, random charges for web services that almost destroyed my company. I remember getting a bill from Google for almost $4k because one of my devs screwed up with google geolocation API. Hard lessons. \n\nYour job now is to do an audit of every tool and rein it all in. Create a list of company approved tools, and you need to manage the billing, users, and permissions. \n\nThis will remove the chaotic feeling and your employees will become experts on the company chosen tools.",

The truth is, the only way to hit 100 dollars a day or reach any level of success is to believe in what you’re selling and in yourself so completely that quitting isn’t an option. You have to decide you’ll make it happen no matter what, that you’d rather go broke chasing it than live comfortably working for someone else.\n\nIt takes 13 hour days, relentless hustle, and a mindset that borders on delusion while people smile and nod with half hearted support. You’ll fail again and again, but that’s part of the process. If you’re not willing to sacrifice comfort, sleep, and approval for what you believe in, don’t start at all. But if you are, if you truly commit, then you’ll find out what you’re made of and success will have no choice but to follow, $100 a day will become a memory and you’ll be asking someone how to make $5000 a day.",

I made each person feel special, heard, and tried to really listen to their stories. I wrote down their name, number, and notes about them. Before they came in to their next appt, I reviewed my notes. Little by little I grew my clientele. Eventually I was able to rent a chair. Eventually I moved salons to a busier location. After a three years, in 1994, I opened a shop that was less than 500 sq ft. Had a business partner, my boyfriend and later got married. 1.5 years later expanded to 1100sq ft. 14 years later, 2006 we sold the shop and moved out of the country. 2000 we broke ground and build a resort in Greece. In 2007 moved back and rebuilt in a nearby neighborhood of our original location where clients can find us again. We continued to build the resort abroad. 2008 the housing crisis hurt the business. We shifted from having employees to transitioning them to rental stylists. 2016 our marriage suffered. 2018 we closed the shop, divorced and I went on my own to continue to grow and shift the business model.

He wanted to listen to my experience and my take on starting a business. The first thing I told him is that it is so difficult. His face changed immediately May be he was expecting some delightful words. He might have had a rosy picture that running a business is all jolly good. \n\nHe said I can find investors, there is a 3 PhD holders team, R&amp;D IP and what not. There is this one client who may pay for the product if they can build it spending 800k$. So on paper it’s just words and promises. I told him that a business should run not because there is funding, or employees are working hard, or there is a trend you can surf on. A business runs when there are customers who are willing to pay for what you sell. Simple. And that part is the hardest in an economically turbulent world. And when revenue doesn’t flow in, everything else becomes tough. I await invoices as small as 2000$ which were not paid by clients for months. I told him that you will be choked every month with no light at the end of the tunnel. May be I should have just lied to him it’s going to be awesome. May be I should have said more nice things but I had very few nice things to say. How would you describe your journey to an aspiring entrepreneur? Roses or thorns? Or a mix of both?",

It's important for people to set realistic expectations and have backup plans in place because running a business is difficult, and even when doing everything right, the whole thing can fall apart due to circumstances beyond the founder's control.\n\nThe whole macho, \"you gotta be tough as nails to make it in business!

Complete with projected revenue charts for year five and a detailed organizational structure for the executive team they'll hire... someday.\n\nMeanwhile, they haven't talked to a single potential customer.\n\nLook, I get it. Writing a business plan *feels* productive. It's concrete. You can show your parents and they'll nod approvingly. But it's also the world's most elaborate procrastination technique.\n\nHere's the thing - your business plan is going to be wrong. Not slightly off. *Catastrophically* wrong. Because you're essentially writing fiction about a market you haven't actually entered yet.\n\nWant to know if your idea works? Find three people who will pay you money for it. Not \"yeah that sounds cool\" people. Not your cousin who promises to buy it when you launch. Actual humans who open their wallets.\n\nThose three customers will teach you more in a week than six months of planning ever could. They'll tell you what features actually matter, what price point works, and which of your assumptions were completely backwards.\n\nThe business plan can come later, after you've proven someone actually wants what you're selling. Until then, you're just writing expensive fan fiction about your own startup.\n\nAm I wrong, or are we all just allergic to actual validation?",

No leads. No replies to emails. No callbacks. \n\nI’ve got the technical expertise and can deliver great results, but clearly I’m missing something on the sales or marketing side.\n\nHas anyone here been through something similar? How did you get your first few clients for a B2B technical service like this?\n\nAny tips on outreach, partnerships, or where to focus my energy would be really appreciated.\n\nWould really appreciate any helpful insight here. 🙏🏾\n\n\nThanks in advance.

Companies are looking for a stable firm that they know they can trust many years into the future.   \n2. Sounds like you are struggling to articulate value for the prospects and that takes time to develop. But start with what you have delivered in the past and spin it into what you can deliver in the future.   \n3. First step is to find the first client and often that will happen from a referral from a friend. Reach out to your friends in the industry asking them to help you get introduced. Often the personal referral from a trusted source is enough to get you started.   \nBest wishes",

We tried a lot of the same stuff you did, and kept failing.  \n\nWe did several things that helped us finally break through. \n\n1. In person networking - most b2b sales will come because of a referral, and doing in person networking.  Our first client actually came from a referral for a man I had helped 2 years earlier.  He had me on his email list so I decided to reach back out to him and share with him what we were offering, quickly saw the value and connected me with several of his clients which all signed on to our services.  We then started attending different networking groups.  The key here is that not a ton of direct sales happen from in person networking.  What happens is you build your referral base from networking and then they refer clients to you.  \n\n2. We read some books that showed us our marketing message was so good. Specifically Story Branding and Star with Why.  They helped so much.  Once we realized our messaging was wrong and updated it we started getting more and more traction from our networking.  \n\nI think most ppl ignore in person networking bc they are building an “online business” but if you are doing 2b2 it’s so key!",

Try meeting people face to face if you can. Go to local business events or small meetups. People are more likely to work with you if they’ve talked to you in person.\n2. **Offer something small for free**. Like a quick network check or a short call. Show what you can do. That helps build trust and they might hire you later or tell others.\n3. **Work with other small tech businesses**. Reach out to local IT shops, web designers, or people who do different tech stuff. If they don’t offer what you do, they might send clients your way.\n4. **Make your online stuff look good**. Your website and LinkedIn should clearly show what you do. Share helpful tips or projects you’ve done. People check those before reaching out.\n5. **Tell everyone you know**. Friends, family, people you went to school or worked with. Just say, \"Hey I started this, let me know if anyone needs help.\" You never know who might connect you.\n\nGetting the first client is the hardest part, but once you do a good job, more will follow.

          "body": "You’re not alone here, but the real issue isn’t your technical ability. It’s how you’re communicating your value. Most engineers try to sell what they do instead of what it means for the client’s business. Small clinics don’t care about data centers or infrastructure. They care about uptime, compliance, and how much productivity they lose when things break.\n\nIf you lead with “I design enterprise-grade infrastructure,” you’ll lose them immediately. But if you say, “I help healthcare practices eliminate downtime and avoid compliance risks through secure, high-availability networks,” now you’re speaking their language. You’re connecting your service to a tangible pain point instead of a technical feature.\n\nI’d also rethink your outreach approach. Cold calling small businesses usually fails because they don’t understand the value yet. Try partnering with MSPs, compliance consultants, or IT service providers who already have relationships with your ideal clients. Offer to take on the complex networking or cloud projects they prefer to refer out. One good partnership can do more than months of random outreach.\n\nFinally, start showing proof of expertise. Write short case studies or even quick LinkedIn posts about common mistakes you fix. Something like “how one clinic lost a day of patient data because of a bad firewall setup” or “how we reduced downtime by 80% with a small infrastructure tweak.” That type of content builds quiet authority and creates inbound interest over time.\n\nThe technical part isn’t what holds most consultants back. It’s learning how to translate that skill into business outcomes that decision makers actually care about. Once you do that, traction starts to come naturally.",

As a hook in a social media post so they lean in and ask \"Say More.\" 👀\n\n2) Every consultant I know and I've spoken to, especially in tech, has not figured out how to break the barrier beyond referrals.

It's difficult to do on your own, I had the support of organisation and other staff, management etc.  This is because you have an idea that it is the sales side but still not sure because of lack of experience.  Thus the learning curve that takes at least 3 months speaking to 20 people a day to even get one sale can be especially daunting. \n\nfind other ways to get leads, marketing and advertising.  But when the leads come in, you still have to sell.  And if you haven't got the skill you might waste quite a few marketing dollars. It most likely will take 3 months to get your first sale.

It's frustrating when you know you can deliver but can't get the first conversation. Your expertise isn't the issue, it's how you position it to your clients.\n\nHere's my take:\n\n1. Reframe from IT consultant to Problem Solver. Talking about data center and enterprise networking to small business owners sounds expensive and complex. They just want to know if your solutions can make their internet faster, stop their system from crashing etc. Repackage your offer around their core anxieties like reliability, security and simplicity.\n2. Stop Cold Calling and Start Building Trust. Cold calling is like charging a fortified wall without intelligence, it rarely works unless you are a sales prodigy. Instead, provide value first. Offer a free, simple network check-up or be the helpful person in the online forums and local business groups who answers IT questions. Don't sell, just help. Let them see you as an Ally.\n3. Find Partners, not just Clients. Your fastest path to clients is through partnerships. Reach out to Managed Service Providers, web developers or cybersecurity firms. They already have the trust of your target clients and often run into projects that are too complex for them, which is what you solve. propose a referral partnership.\n\nYou have the expertise. Now it's about layering on the trust and positioning. Once you are a trusted voice, your clients will come.\n\n(Source: I guide leaders on market engagement and write about these principles in \"The Strategic Treatise\", I will be starting a weekly \"Insight First Clinic\" on Reddit to break down problems like this.)",

Small clinics don't need connectivity and infrastructure design at enterprise scale. You're pitching high-end services to businesses that probably just need basic IT support.\n\nOur clients in IT consulting learned that enterprise networking clients aren't found through cold calls to random small businesses. They come from referrals, partnerships with MSPs who need specialist help, or targeting mid-sized companies actually doing infrastructure projects.\n\nData center and cloud infrastructure work goes to companies with 100 plus employees, serious tech budgets, and existing IT teams. Those deals come through warm intros, industry connections, or subcontracting with bigger consulting firms. Not cold calling dentist offices.\n\nIf you want small business clients, pivot your services. Offer managed IT support, cybersecurity assessments, cloud migrations for Office 365. That's what SMBs actually pay for. The enterprise networking stuff you're good at is overkill for their needs.\n\nBetter approach is partner with IT service providers who already work with your target clients. Offer to handle their complex networking projects when they need specialist help. You get clients, they get to serve their customers better without hiring full-time network engineers.\n\nJoin local tech groups, attend industry meetups, get to know other IT consultants and MSPs. Referrals and partnerships are how consulting businesses actually grow, not cold outreach to businesses who don't need what you're selling.\n\nFour months with zero traction means your targeting is wrong, not that you suck at sales.

He quickly gained demand and got loads of customers, giving less attention to each customer. One time my car had a problem and he kept the car for almost a week giving weak explanations and ghosting. I changed the shop and went to a better one that gave prompt responses even though they are a bit more expensive. People want to save time, move smoothly even if things are expensive.",

We both work full-time on it, but she thinks since I handle most of the sales and make slightly more from commissions, I should cover all the rent and expenses until things “balance out.” I don’t see it that way we built this together, and I think we should both contribute fairly, even if not perfectly evenly. Last month we actually missed paying rent on our office space because we couldn’t agree who should transfer the payment. I’ve been playing on my phone at night trying to find advice on couples who run a business together, but everyone says the same thing: “separate personal and business money.” Easier said than done when you share both.  \nHas anyone here built a business with their partner? How do you handle the money side without it turning personal or ruining the relationship?",

We ended up having to hire +/- 20 transcriptionists, managing a team, and build all the infrastructure (contracts, onboarding, communications, accounting system, etc) and on the weekends, or at night, we worked on automating some of our processes to become more efficient the next week.\n5 years later, we are still 20-25 people, have a real strong tech stack, and produce 5x more than our initial capacity in much less time. \nAt first, our AI was Dragon from Nuance.\nNow it’s a combination of all the major providers you know + our special recipe tested and improved over time.\n\nIt was a huge challenge to build.

Still enough time for another 2 years living really well. \nNow I am trying some software crap that might work out but chances are still very slim.",

      "selftext": "I spent 30 years building my healthcare media business before selling it to private equity in 2021. But before my successful exit, I failed to sell it four times.\n\n**The two biggest mistakes I made:**\n\n1. **Believing you need $10M+ in topline revenue before anyone will take you seriously** \\- This bad advice kept me from getting professional help early on in my selling journey. It also delayed my timing and kept me pointed at a north star that wasn't even true. There are hundreds of quality lower and middle-market M&amp;A firms and brokers who work with businesses well below $10M but with strong EBITDA.\n2. **Trying to manage the sale process myself** \\- I thought I could handle it since I'd built the business and we were small enough. Huge mistake. It's a massive time suck trying to sell, and managing that while growing or maintaining the business is virtually impossible.\n\n**What I found success in:**\n\nHaving someone in my corner who is an expert in the field, has past M&amp;A experience, and follows a proven process makes all the difference. Whether that's an investment bank, M&amp;A advisor, or quality broker depends on your size and situation, but trying to DIY your exit is a recipe for disaster in my opinion.\n\nAfter my deal closed, I stayed on as CEO, growing the business further, and then have spent my last three years sharing my exit journey with other owners who are trying or thinking about selling. I kept seeing many of the same patterns, all are strong business operators, but many are underprepared for selling, getting bad advice, or lacking clarity on what actually drives a successful sale.\n\n**Questions for other business owners:**\n\n* Do you subscribe to the age-old motto that all businesses are built to be sold? Is your dream to successfully exit your business or do you have other plans?\n* If you want to sell, what are the biggest factors standing in your way?\n* If you've sold a business before, what surprised you most about the process?\n* What's the worst advice you've heard about selling a business?\n\nHappy to share more about what worked (and what didn't) in my experience, but for now curious on all your thoughts. Thanks in advance!",

We were still doing our finances ourselves, as opposed to having a CFO or a proper finance person do them in-house, which as you suspect is immediately what I hired after going through the initial process.\n\nOn the second failed attempt, I got to the altar, literally the day of closing, and the buyer came back and said that their investment committee had changed their minds. This was after five months of due diligence by the way. That one really hurt.\n\nThe other two occasions, I got approached by public companies directly and started negotiations, but realized that negotiation on my own behalf was a loser's game. I had no leverage and couldn't play hardball and was going to end up with a low offer so I backed out.\n\nCan't share exact multiples, but the final deal was with a PE firm, and was a solid lower middle-market transaction. Fortunately large majority was cash at closing with a small retained equity %, and a small earn-out component tied to growth over the time I stayed on as CEO.\n\nNowadays, I'm working with my son on ExitClarity, an exit readiness platform for business owners considering a sale. My mission really is to try to help others avoid all the mistakes that I made when trying to exit, and if I can do that, maybe it'll feel a little bit like it was worth it taking all those lumps haha.",

          "body": "I just sold my company after 26 years and 2 failed attempts. \n\nMy plan was to grow my company through acquisitions.  That is much harder than you think. After 2 solid years of trying to buy other companies,  I decided I needed an equity partner. \n\nIn the last 4 years, I have been approached at least 3 times per week by brokers, PE. And strategic buyers. I had no intention of selling. Then,  I started talking to them. I was offered an LOI  by a strategic that I really liked for a fair amount of money. I didn't really want to go that route so I declined after a lot of negotiations and soul searching.\n\n I was then approached by a holding company that offered me a platform position. Dream come true, right? They offered me great money, but during the negotiations, they kept changing the deal to the point that we both decided to walk away. \n\nThe M&amp;A advisor from the buyers' side then called me up and said they felt that my company was stronger than the offers I was getting, and they wanted to represent me. We came to an agreement, and they put me in front of 6 different buyers. PE, strategic, and a few other types. \n\nI just sold to my dream buyer. Great track record for growth. I named the terms of the deal and got a high multiple.  They are great to work with, and we are in full acquisition mode as a platform. \n\nIt took many years of building the company I would want to buy, but it paid off. The advice OP is giving is right on. Get an advisor, an M&amp;A CPA, and a good attorney.  You need a quality team. Your CPA will also need to advise you on tax consequences.

In my area it could easily do far more what it does now in events. It has a unique track record though, especially since I acquired it in January of 2021, and the previous owner was ill for several years prior to that, so it was flying by the seat of its pants for quite some time. I happily have a large scale corporate agent who has watched me rebuild it and has a high interest in a strategic partnership. I have another entertainment business (physical with a growing digital component) that I have spent 20+ years building that has global potential, and I would much rather focus on developing that for the next 3-5 years, so this would be a great way for me to work on that with some financial security behind me. But I am learning all this as I go!  The tips for the team to hire in this thread were immediately valuable.\n\n My questions are: How do I start thinking in terms of negotiating value of items, intellectual property compensation, or salaries or pay for team members? I know with this partnership it would be an immediate value addition to their bottom line, and I don't want to sell myself short. They already have trucks, warehouse space, and an administrative team we would integrate into. Without even trying this business easily does 60 events per year and could do 10x that if it had the resources (as demonstrated by a long established competitor) and someone (not me) who thrives on a higher level of activity. I will be bringing them hundreds of new talent members, a whole set of equipment that is ready to make money, a growing client base with dozens of repeat clients, multiple formulas for multiple markets, plus a business name that has been around for over 20 years with a 5 star reputation. Of course there is so much more to the story, but those are the most salient points I can think of to start.\n\nThere was one year where we did over 100 events and still could have booked more, but that was the year I learned what the term \"uncontrolled growth\" meant and I immediately set about controlling it. We grossed $250,000 that year, but this is a VERY people dependent business so that came with a lot of headaches from other people. So I decided I would only do what I knew I could handle with a small trusted crew. We still are easily into six figures, but it operates on a boutique family level at the moment. Various family members lend skill and expertise and it contributes a form of support at the moment for all of us involved. Those family members ideally would be integrated into the partnership to help the transition over the next couple years. \n\nThat was a lot, but things are moving fast (as they always do) so any input is welcome! And if this was just a casual read for anyone, thank you for making it this far!",

      "selftext": "Im 34 years old with a Mechanical engineering degree. I have been in corporate world since 2017 mainly in manufacturing, maintenance and facility engineering, and management experience. Ive done really cool things and built a pretty solid resume. Money has been great but im generally burned out. I several years back that I don't get fulfillment out of working for others but I stayed in the trap. I have my first child otw and I decided to leave a extremely well paying job with great benefits due to a horrible culture which honestly was turning into the worst version of myself. Hind sight, I believe i should have stayed at least until the baby was born and took my paternity leave but i figured if i didnt leave i probably never would. After i left in july, I started my own facilities and equipment consulting business. Ive been struggling on how to get things started even though I have the llc, website, business cards etc. I also dont really know how to sale, if that makes sense. I feel like im losing the fire thats in me that makes me, me. I believe i also have too much ego and pride that has been holding me back for the majority of my life, which i take full responsibility for. The burnout and loss of confidence honestly is tearing me apart as I have a pregnant wife and baby due in 3 weeks. We have a decent nest egg of savings but its tearing me apart as a man. How do I get the drive back and push through to do the one thing ive been wanting to do for years, which is have a business and work for myself. I understand there will be stress in any environment and im willing to grind through, no stranger to hard work. Has anyone experienced this and successfully started there business? Any advice is greatly appreciated. \n\nAlso to add, about 4 years ago we relocated to atlanta for my job and isolated our selves from all friends and family. I didnt realize how much of an impact it would have on me not being social and not having a team in your corner rooting for you. Again, this is all on me and having something to prove to myself at the time. My goal now is to be a good father, husband,  and to have fulfillment in my life with whatever job or business I do.",

I call this “killing the ego,” and this is one of the most important things for building a business, because when ego guides you, you risk missing out on very attractive opportunities that could hurt your ego.

It's okay, but you really should focus on only one thing. It seems your family, because the main purpose is to be a good father and husband. Leave all the other stuff for a couple of months, spend more time with your wife and after birth with both of them. I assume she understands your mood and worries the same as you.

Alex Hormozi is a great one for business and specifically sales marketing. That may help.\nMake sure you're exercising. When I get mega stressed it's usually because I haven't moved or stretched in a while. Guard your health like your life depends on it. \nStarting a business usually fails for most because they give up after the first try. The first try often does not go well. \nIf you're having trouble selling hire a guy. If you can't afford to hire him, give him a fat commission. All the good guys I know are 100% commission \nGet a good job for now.  Keep that job and run your business on the side until you get some sales coming in and you can't afford to keep your regular job.

I’m not saying you are not doing anything but in this world sales are a big driver.\nI’m not a sales guy myself either but having the right product/service in the right place and letting your target audience know about it helps a lot.\nYou need a quick win. As others said here before: find something else with a shorter sales cycle than projects so you can start getting some cash flow.\nProjects are attractive because they mean big money but they also take time, customers like to trust big  established companies and most of the time mean you have to finance it because the big customer will not.\nSo, before you get to that point (in case you want), find something you are sure most of your potential customers need and get it moving.

I offered him a side of fries instead, but he lost his temper and started cussing at me. He claimed I was 'full of shit' and that I had plenty of product, which wasn't true.\n\nAs the owner, I'm used to dealing with difficult customers, but this guy's behavior was unacceptable. I yelled at him to leave and told him not to come back.\n\nI know some of you might think I'm a jerk for cutting him off, but honestly, I feel like he took advantage of my kindness for too long.

Here's my thoughts:\n\n1) He has a mental health condition that prevents him from being able to control his behavior, which is why he is homeless. It could be FAS, it could be brain damage from chemical dependency, it could be a conduct disorder or autism, it could be anything. Whatever it is, he wasn't \"taking advantage of you\". He was hungry and desperate, and wasn't able to cope with the hamburger he was expecting to instead be fries. He lost it because he isn't able to control his emotions when he's upset, which again, is why he is homeless.\n\n2) You absolutely did the right thing, you don't owe him a sandwich and your priority is protecting yourself, your employees, your customers and your business.

But we're known for our produce (and we're also a SNAP retailer) so it's a necessity. Produce has different phases: A Grade, B Grade, Free Grade, Piggy Grade, and Compost. We don't have enough B Grade to warrant a trip out to a food rescue organization so we started a \"free table\" where we would put unsellable but still edible produce and other items. Folks from all tax brackets would take from the free table but most importantly: food insecure folks could take from it without having to feel awkward about it.\n\nWell this one unhoused guy decided it was his personal buffet and would eat from it all day. I started offering him bags to take anything he wanted to go. He decided that outside of our store was his home. He would try to come in after closing hours to ask for more free food. One time, I was working from inside the locked store (lights were off and blinds were down) and I felt someone staring at me. I looked up and he was bent down so he could stare at me from under the blinds. That was the first time I called the cops.\n\nWe stopped putting out the free produce for a while because he creeped us out so much (for a multitude of reasons). Customers expressed disappointment so when we hadn't seen the creeper for a long while, we decided to bring it back. Well then creeper man got out of jail and resumed his antics. I was setting up the table and ran into him and we had a nice conversation where he seemed sober + thanked me for feeding him. I offered him a to go bag and he informed me that he was planning on hanging out because he likes it in front of my store. I very politely gave a reason for why he should hang out in one of the more comfortable spots in the area and he went ballistic. I tried to deescalate the situation and he threatened to kill me. I called the cops again, got a different officer, who informed me that sometimes people say things they don't mean.\n\nSince the cops don't care about the safety of my team + my neighbors, the free table is gone permanently and the good free stuff goes to the unhoused people in the neighborhood who periodically check in on us to make sure creeper man hasn't been bothering us.",

I’ll say this - a few years ago, I would’ve thought differently, but now I would say definitely give him another chance if you can.  I can’t imagine what it would be like being homeless on the streets. During the holidays, Easter and Thanksgiving, I go get meals from Waffle House or sandwiches from subway etc and hand them out in downtown Atlanta.  Every person is grateful.  Recently I saw a very sick older man outside of a convenience store in the city. I went in and got him juice and some type of a Power bar and a banana. After I handed it to him, some man yelled at me where where’s mine?! I went back in and bought him the same thing.  I feel like, who cares, just keep giving if you can. Whether they’re appreciative or not, I can’t imagine what I would be like mentally if I lived on the street for more than a few weeks and desperate.  Like my cousin, many of these people have had mental issues that got them there.",

I usually don’t use the word consultant because people don’t like it, but that’s what I am. I get it, a lot of people marketing themselves as consultants don’t provide value. If I don’t think I can provide value, I’ll decline and refer you to someone I think will. \n\nI’m probably at least “adjacent to the spectrum” (as my husband says). Not everyone wants to be friends with me but people who hire me appreciate that I’m no BS, all business, and I know what I’m talking about. If there are rules, schedules, or processes I know them better than anyone else and I will navigate you through it. And you’re paying a decent hourly rate so I’m not here to waste anyone’s time. I’m busy enough anyway. People appreciate that, usually.\n\nI don’t remember your post, but the haters aren’t wrong. Most people fail at this. You have to have thick skin and build a clientele with a ton of discipline. Doing it without a lot of personal charisma requires that your work be extremely competent. I wish you success!",

I moved to a new city last year and in my old city there was a big scene for marketers with meetups and conferences every week, so I wanted to start something similar here. \n\nI spent $100 on the venue, $100+ on catering, spent money on flyers, and spent a lot of time making the presentation I was going to give, hanging up flyers at dozens of local businesses, meeting business owners, and promoting on meetup.com, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. Several people RSVP'd and I had close to 50 people interested or saying they would come including my friends. I promoted the event with my small team every day for 5 weeks sending reminders just enough to not be annoying. \n\nI got there and set everything up and... nothing. No one came. One person had been asking me questions on meetup named Curtis and I saw one person there who looked like him so I went up to say hello and introduced myself and he looked at me strange and said his name was Shawn and it was nice to meet me. SO AWKWARD. I casually played it off and left him alone, then waited 30+ minutes after the start time by the front door of the venue like some kind of 1970's breakup song to see if anyone would show before packing up my stuff and going home. \n\nNext month I was planning a follow up and was going to have a guest speaker come out, but now I'm thinking of emailing him (a respected name in my field) and canceling next month because it would embarrass me even more. \n\nMaybe Thursday nights aren't good? Maybe 6:30pm is a bad time for a business event? Maybe my offer wasn't good enough? Maybe something else was going on last night that I didn't know about? Maybe I should have tried paid ads on the radio or Facebook instead? Maybe I should try changing it to Saturday and pay a big name to appear? Maybe this town isn't interested in marketing and I need to try the big city 30 minutes away?\n\nI guess I'm just venting into the void here. I used to be in bands and I've definitely played shows where no one came, so this is nothing new, but it's never fun to go through it. \n\n\n\nI realize I'm not good at in-person event promotion and need to keep trying things until I make progress.",

We've been working all day and want to relax in a chill setting. Take a few minutes at some point to thank any sponsors, caterers, etc. Ask for feedback for future events, and ask people to think about who they would invite to the next one to make this better for everyone. If you tell me theres a speaker and it starts at 5:30, if I cant make it on time, im not going to show up AT ALL. (LOL show up late in the middle of a speaker's presentation? How embarrassing! Sorry I couldn't make it!)\n\n\n- Make it a networking event where they can promote themselves and their business, and mingle with other professionals. If you make it 5-7, people can drift in and out. Some people can leave work early, some will show up late, and people can come and go as they please.\n\n\n- I need to stress this needs to be an opportunity for the networkers to meet new people and expand into new markets. The main attraction needs to be the attendees. All the successful independent networking events I go to do this. The host NEVER spends time peddling their own product; they go mingle and build relationships just like everyone else has to. Don't worry, people will remember you and that you hosted the events.\n\n\n- See if you can find a venue you can pay for where drinks are available. A slower night at a restaurant with a bar or something. Buy some appetizers but tell everyone to support your host and buy a drink! Give the venue host a minute to speak if they want.\n\n- As you grow ask if people have swag or door prizes to donate. Put business cards in a bowl for drawings (must be present to win, keeps some people there longer). \"We have a gift card here for a free 30 minute massage from Queen Spa.\" \"Up next is a branded tumbler from Reddit Bank and trust!\" \"A floral arrangement made by Flowers Unlimited, donated as a prize from Care Today Urgent Care. Thank you Care Today for this lovely prize. Let's see who's taking it home!\"\n\nTL;DR: no speakers, make it easy to come and go, find a venue (and give the venue an opportunity to make money aka the bar, also buy some appetizers), and focus is on the people attending. This is for them and about them.\n\nP.S. take this with a grain of salt I am tall, white, and handsome. Sample size of 1 and a lot of those factors probably play more into that than my actual ability.\n\nP.P.S. I'm not saying I'm handsome as a brag. I just realized its a factor, and I found out because when my wife goes with me to networking events, she extends her hand to shake the hand of EVERY SINGLE OTHER WOMAN that approaches us at light speed. \"Hi I'm xxx, Hailhydra's wife. Nice to meet you.\" Before she did this, other women ive known a long time through networking would come up and we'd give each other a hug. She put a stop to that quick lol.\n\nP.P.P.S my mom said I was handsome too. So sample size of...2?",

Monday and Tuesdays are also usually slower at restaurants, so youre likely to be able to get a separate room for no charge, and specials on food/appetizers, etc. People are also more likely to show up if there is free food - you said you catered - did \"food\" get mentioned on your advertising? \n\nAlso, since youre new to the community, you can reach out to any local papers and get in touch with one of the reporters/writers that cover local business news. Its a good relationship to have... amd free advertising. \n\nAnd.. the issue may not have had anything to do with you. Perhaps the area is saturated with business groups/meet upset, and people are just... tired of people.

Invite them to thank them for their business, and ask them to bring other community members.\n\nIf you're good, in this economy, at finding new clients and new work, you will absolutely figure this out.

Gather way more feedback from people who match your target attendee persona. \n\nFrankly, I'm more of a fan of pitching the idea in detail and then getting people to pay for a ticket in advance before you even start setting up the event. Try Reddit, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.. \n\nIn this way, if it flops, you've wasted no time and money, saved yourself a lot of effort and heartbreak, and ruled out that particular event idea. You can validate ideas and demand in this way without wasting money, time, effort, and other resources.\n\nHowever, I'm not familiar with in-person events.

Saying this so you can understand I might know quite a bit about what is going on here.\n\nFor people saying 6:30 is too late, I completely disagree. It's actually the most perfect time you could be doing it. All of my events are either at Lunch OR 6:30pm.\n\nSo several things. 1. If the goal of the event is to talk to people and you had Curtis already reaching out and asking questions why not just jump on a call with him? That to me, feels like an immediate win with a lot of upside. Even giving you the immediate ability to pitch something.\n\n2. Your venue will absolutely make or break your event. Pubs will always have extremely low turn out. Especially if you are Targeting professionals. Want to know where you can have meetups that won't cost you anything? Coffee shops like Panera Bread.\n\nMy first several meetups were at Paneras or Starbucks and once I grew the groups to around 30 people consistently coming out, I was able to use that to get bigger venues to donate the space, like co-working spaces. Especially if you have people in tech or marketers because they love having remote offices they can work out of. Best part, Panera is free. They just want folks there to buy snacks or coffee. So you save all of that money alone. Several hundred dollars in your pocket now.\n\nI am a very big believer in Value for time and a meetup will break if you don't figure out what that looks like. What is the value for their time being there, driving there, and then driving home. If they are THINKING about driving there and can't figure out what the value is, they will just make a turn and go home instead of going there.\n\nHope this gives you some ideas and if you want to DM me or reach out to ask more, happy to explain more.",

Half the receipts get lost, nobody remembers what category things belong to, and by the time I match everything, the month’s already over. It’s not even about people overspending I trust the team it’s just the administrative chaos that eats away hours every week. I’ve looked at some apps that claim to “automate” the process, but most feel like overkill or require everyone to constantly log in and upload stuff.  \nWhat do you all use to make this less painful?

Once you get into printing thousands it gets much cheaper. PUT AN OFFER ON THE CARD (we would say something like bring this card in to get a free xxxxx with any purchase). \n\nMax you can mail and add to the cart at the time is about 5k households if I remember correctly. You create an online account at USPS and select the mail routes you want them to go to. You can even filter for age, avg income. You put the cards in bundles with sheets for each route and drop them off at the post office. \n\nWe get people that bring them in months even a year later...so they're still paying off and we opened that store almost 2 years ago.",

Which make just be too expensive of customer acquisition cost. I think you’re cooked tbh, as far as growth. \n\nThe changes to the SEO probably killed your whole current growth model. You were likely able to really maximize the bang for your buck under the old structure, and no one except google is going to know for sure why it changed and/or what you can do about it.\n\nYou would not be at all the first to have this problem after a major update. Any time this happens, some companies get crushed. It might be possible to recover, but also possible you just had the perfect mix of whatever factors mattered. As time goes on, people will know better, but then as more people know, they’ll change it again. \n\nSo you can keep spending money on SEO and consultants, but you’ll probably just burn it all. I know there’s going to be some consulting firm out there that actually has a very good idea of what the changes are, but that’s going to be impossible to truly determine you’re going with the right one, except doing it and seeing the results.\n\nSo just comes down to how much money you want to gamble. Could work, could not. \n\nIf your risk tolerance is low, I’d look at selling your business based on the value of the brand / customer relationships.

Be careful during that hosting provider move because you'll need to make sure to add redirects if your site structure changes or you risk worsening your SEO issue.\n\nAs far as whether your business is worth anything, I'd quite honestly recommend a talk with a business broker. Get a valuation and stop questioning it. They're probably going to tell you that you should have come to them 2 years ago, but at least you'll stop second guessing where you stand.\n\nRegarding your Google ads spend, you should be capping your target CPA so that you're not spending much more than you are willing to spend per lead. Swap your other  advertising spend into something more localized whether it's local business organizations, direct mail, TV ads, or other promotional events. In other words, diversify your ads.",

Also, let them know that you will need a new credit application completed if an increase is required. \n\nNow is your opportunity to make changes to your current credit application form and credit granting processes. \n\nYou want to ensure your credit application collects the right information to get the best financial picture of the business (if they're a small or new business, you want their personal credit reports as well). You also want it to have the correct legal verbiage to allow you to collect the business credit information, as well as personal credit info. It should outline your credit terms (N30/2% Interest in balances owing, yadda yadda), steps/fees to collect, etc. The credit application I created also had separate legal verbiage for a personal guarantee.\n\nOnce you have all that signed, it should be passed onto whatever business credit bureau you've chosen to partner with, preferably one that can also provide personal credit reports. Then, based upon the information you receive: determine if you're granting credit. If you are: What is the credit limit?\n\nThe final piece is to set your POS to not process invoices once the client has hit their limit, avoiding this issue again.",

We will sell to them at a fair price. \n\nThey know we are not out to fight with everyone over every penny on the street. There is plenty of work out there for honest people. \n\nThe point of my ramble is they are wholesalers only. So not being able to sell to a consumer leaves a door open for a recommendation.

My mentor always said the day firing is easy is the day you shouldn't be a leader. You need to make the right decision for your business but it's not easy knowing that person is losing their job. Especially in a small business, you more than likely know their family or at least know about them.  We should always maintain our compassion.\n\nThis is probably my driving force behind hiring very carefully, because I haaaate terminating. I like using interview guides with predetermined questions and 1-3 answer ratings so I'm very clear on who I need to hire and my notes are the data to back them up. I like pretty much everyone when I meet them and the interview is the best you're going to get.  I never hire on the spot and typically try to have someone else I trust in the interview for additional perspective.  I always give myself time after the interview to really think through their answers.\n\nI have seen so many things go wrong when clients wait to fire too. They put it off and every single time, it ends in a dumpster fire. Property damage, reputation with vendors or customers destroyed, workmans comp injuries- I've heard/witnessed some wild stories. \n\nKeep performance notes so you can make an educated decision and have regular performance conversations with your employees so it's not a surprise. This also keeps your top employees happy because seeing poor behavior or poor performance tolerated will demotivate them right out the door.",

This spans across industries - hardly anyone has a website, and if they do it looks like one from the 1990's.   \n  \n2 - Italians really seem to like to preserve the traditional things - e.g., in my part of Liguria, they actively discourage street performers, creative artists, any non-Italian cuisine. There is a lot of local government regulation put into preserving the status quo. (this has pros and cons but for your purposes, probably a con)  \n  \n3 - You really should look into the tax situation and labor rights. You will quickly find that the economics are really tough and entrepreneurial success is essentially disincentivized big time, IMO. As a result, 'bare bones' businesses seem to be the norm - both my veterinarian and my optometrist have no web presence, make appointments by texts via WhatsApp, and they are the receptionist, the doctor, the accounting department and the cleaning staff in their business. i.e. sole proprietors, no employees.   \n  \nGood luck!",

Seemed like the sky was the limit. We make a product and sell both online and in person. We also have a storefront/production facility. \n\nOur online sales grew consistently until they peaked at 10k in March. They’ve since stabilized around 30% below that. We’ve released new products, explored other markets, and maintained consistent presence where we’ve had success. Yet we seem to lose a customer for every one we gain. \n\nI always thought gaining the initial customers would be the hardest part of running a business. For the third year in a row, I’ve been proven wrong. Any advice for growing beyond this point? I’m in the wellness sector",

          "body": "Three years stuck at the same revenue means you've got a retention problem, not an acquisition problem. You're churning customers as fast as you're bringing them in, which means either your product isn't sticky enough or you're targeting the wrong people.\n\nWellness products need repeat purchases to grow. If customers buy once and disappear, you don't have a business, you just have expensive one-time transactions. Our clients in wellness who broke through this plateau focused obsessively on getting customers to buy 2-3 times, not just converting new people.\n\nYour online sales dropping 30% from peak is a red flag. That's not normal fluctuation, something changed. Did you stop doing what was working? Did ad costs spike? Did a competitor launch? You need to diagnose what actually caused that drop instead of just accepting it.\n\nReleasing new products when your existing ones aren't retaining customers is just spreading yourself thinner. Fix retention on what you already have before you add complexity. Get your current customers buying more frequently or in higher amounts.\n\nThe storefront gives you an advantage most online wellness brands don't have. Use it to build real relationships with local customers who become regulars. Those people should be your core base that stabilizes revenue even when online fluctuates.\n\nFor breaking past $200k, you need either way better retention so your customer base actually grows instead of staying flat, or you need to increase average order value so the same number of customers generate more revenue. Pick one and focus there for 6 months.\n\nCheck your numbers honestly. What's your repeat purchase rate? If it's under 30%, that's your problem. What's your customer lifetime value? If people only buy once for $50, you can't profitably scale. Fix those fundamentals before you worry about growth tactics.",

Even spoons up 30%, and so much other stuff. \n\nWe tried to fight it with waste control, portion control, labor control, adding higher-margin items, etc. It kinda helped at first, but eventually we decided to raise prices by $1 across the board this following Monday. However, everything keeps going up and not going to stop. \n\nThe problem is, you can’t just keep increasing prices every month. Customers can only handle so much before they start walking because fundamentally they are still getting the same check, if not less. It’s honestly insane right now. And it’s scary seeing how many restaurants are shutting down lately around us. \n\nSo I’m just wondering, what’s your current situation like? How are you guys managing to survive this mess?\n",

I used excersise as the main driver but also having really busy weekends off helped. Up at 6am and filled the day with stuff. It could be gym at 7-8, cook a good breakfast, a walk in the park from 9-11am then a coffee date with my partner and then a trip into the city in the afternoon, then a cheap comedy show in the evening. Do two days like that and Monday comes around and you feel like you've not thought about work forever. The worst thing you can do in my opinion is spend a whole weekend doing a couple things as your brain when your painting is probably mostly on autopilot and drifts to work stuff, at least mine does all the time. It's hard to maintain but the busier my social life is outside of work the less burnt out I feel.",

You can’t expect yourself to perform well in any business or job if your body and mind are on life support.\n\nGo for walks, take small breaks throughout the day, go to the gym, play video games, read books, eat healthy food, etc.\n\nDo what you like to do so you don’t get burnt out.

While our financial performance appears to be satisfactory on paper and operationally, we continue to incur a monthly loss of approximately $16,000.\n\nOur weekly sales exceed $45,000, with a gross profit margin of approximately 64% and a wage expense of 28%. However, the primary contributor to our financial challenges is the substantial amount we allocate to delivery aggregators. This month, despite a total sales of $237,000 (representing five weeks according to the retail calendar), we incurred approximately $37,000 in payments to Uber and DoorDash.\n\nDespite these substantial sales figures, we persist in operating at a loss. Given our limited capacity as a franchise, what strategies can I implement to improve our financial situation? \n\nEdit: Another problem is, I have a gym next door and we have a shared drive-way with them. The gym customers take all the parking spots, even they park on the driveway. This makes it extremely difficult for drivers to-thru customers. My google review is full with people cursing gym folks for their bad parking practices. I get only 400 cars per week in my drive-thru as opposed to 1700 in a drive-thru of another store situated in quieter road than mine. ",

Offer a small discount for direct orders (still cheaper than 28% commission).\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Delivery zone optimization\\*\\* - Are you delivering too far? Tightening your radius can cut delivery times and costs. Most customers order within 3km anyway.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Minimum order value\\*\\* - If you're not already doing this, set minimums that make the economics work. Better to lose a $15 order than subsidize it.\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Ghost kitchen model\\*\\* - Some franchises are shifting to delivery-only locations with lower overhead. Could you test a smaller, cheaper location for delivery orders only?\n\n\n\n5. \\*\\*Negotiate with aggregators\\*\\* - At your volume, you have leverage. Many will reduce commission if you commit to exclusivity or higher volume.\n\n\n\nThe real question: What's your customer acquisition cost through aggregators vs other channels? If they're bringing NEW customers who become regulars, the fee might be worth it short-term.\n\n\n\nWhat's your current split between aggregator orders vs direct orders?",

          "body": "That $37k monthly hit from delivery platforms on $237k sales is absolutely crushing your margins, and honestly this is exactly what we see across thousands of restaurants. The brutal math here is that youre paying roughly 15.6% of total revenue just to delivery aggregators, which when combined with your 28% labor costs is eating up almost half your gross profit before you even touch rent, utilities, or other overhead. What most franchise owners dont realize is that you can actually negotiate better rates with these platforms once you hit certain volume thresholds, plus theres consolidation software that can help manage multiple platform orders through one system so you dont miss orders during peak times. At vGrubs we work with restaurants to aggregate all their delivery platforms into one dashboard and help optimize their delivery operations to actually turn those orders profitable instead of just break-even customer acquisition tools.\n\nThe parking situation is probably costing you way more than the delivery fees though since drive-thru customers typically have much higher profit margins than delivery orders.",

We work with tons of restaurants at Kea AI and that 15-16% you're paying to delivery platforms is just insane when you're already operating on thin margins. The math just doesn't work for most places.\n\nHere's what I've seen work for similar situations. First, you gotta start building your own direct ordering channel aggressively. Since you're on a busy roadway with good drive-thru traffic, focus on converting those customers to order direct next time. Simple stuff like receipt inserts with a discount code for direct orders, or even just training staff to mention \"next time you can skip the wait and order ahead on our app.\" The goal is getting people off those expensive platforms gradually.\n\nSecond thing is optimizing your phone orders since thats free revenue. Make sure every call gets answered professionally because missed calls during lunch rush are literally money walking away. A lot of places lose thousands just from unanswered phones when they're busy. Even something as simple as a proper phone system that queues calls instead of going to voicemail can help capture more of that direct business.\n\nThe delivery platforms aren't going anywhere but you dont have to be completely dependent on them. Start tracking what percentage of your sales come from each channel and set a goal to reduce that delivery platform percentage by even 5% over the next few months. With your volume that could save you almost $1000 monthly. Small changes add up fast when you're doing $45k+ weekly.",

It’s been so difficult and time consuming trying to get clear information on how the tariffs work in practice. We sell something worth $50 and the client ends up paying almost 100% tax when you add up shit like the “broker fee” that UPS adds and a bunch of other surcharges. I can’t even accurately quote clients for shipments because suddenly they’ll get hit with an unexpected charge. And for a couple of bigger clients I’ve ended up paying the fee myself to save face. But even then it’s lost business, and a massive burden. I’ve wasted hours on the phone with UPS Mumbai Team. This is worse than a tax and it’s been a roller coaster trying to run a business without having predictable numbers. I feel the biggest winner here is UPS and whoever the “brokers” are that charge more than the actual tariff. I can’t comprehend how any of this is acceptable to anyone, let alone the party of “small government”. Everyday it’s fucking something in this timeline",

But then under \"Contact a Lender\" it literally named two of their competitors by name. It straight up told people to call these other businesses. \n\n  \nAlthough their site was mentioned in the carousel, it wasn't mentioned in the answer at all. \n\nThat query was high intent, and although the users domain ranks top 5 in the blue links and was included in the carousel, it wasn't referred and they got cut out compeletely. \n\n  \nI'd honestly recommend everyone here to take 5 mins asking Google/ChatGPT/Perplexity etc questions about your business and see what happens. Are you getting recommended (not just in the carousel but in the answer) or is your competiton. \n\nFull disclosure, my work is in this space, so I'm looking at these results all day and thought it was an important warning to share with other business owners who rely on search for customers. \n\nAnyone else seeing stuff like this in their industry?

Every single lawsuit between the franchisor and franchisees is required by law to be listed in the FDD. The franchisor i worked for often settled out of court to show FDD'S with no lawsuits.\n\n\nSubway's FDD is insane, like 2 bibles stacked on top of each other and 90% of it is lawsuits. I struggle to make sense of how someone receives that, sees all the lawsuits, and says, \"I still think I can make this work.\" If the article is true and there are 37 former Dickey's franchisees, shame on both Dickey's and anyone who buys one and fails (seriously, did you not bother to read the document before you forked over hundreds of thousands of dollars?)\n\nThen again, most may not have lawsuits because in the franchise agreement, you agree that all legal matters / arbitration takes place in the home county / state of the franchisor. Their legal counsel just has to drive down the road while you're buying plane tickets and hotels.\n\n\nMy former employer was careful to never gave sales projections, but if someone asked if they could make $50k a month in revenue, I'm sure the salesperson would tell them it's possible (and technically it would be possible, but the salesperson didn't tell you that you were going to make 50k a month; you did).\n\n\nThe last thing is people would lie on reporting their net worth. If my old company said you need $200k to cover franchise fees / equipment / build out of space, and access to another $150k for operating expenses until break even / profitability, people would just sign away that they had access to money like that even if they really didn't (and we have no way of checking because it could be inheritance, mommy and daddy, or in 1 instance a lady signed up for 16 credit cards at the same time to cover operating expenses).\n\n\nTL;DR please for the love of god don't sell yourself on the dream of owning your own business and throw common sense out the window. Go talk to current franchisees on your own if youre looking at a franchise. And if the numbers don't add up, don't do it.",
