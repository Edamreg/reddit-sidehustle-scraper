I spent approx 8 hours making the first product for myself after I couldn’t find anyone selling it on Etsy. So then I thought I’d risk the $22 start up cost and see if anyone else would buy it for $3.  The next day someone did. By the end of week 2, I was selling nearly a hundred a day of the same identical product. \n\nSo that first 3-4 months or so, I invested my initial 8 hours time on the product, plus 1 hour to make an Etsy store, then approx 10-15 minutes a week answering questions/messages. I made approx $5k in that time.\n\nAfter that I invested a solid week of 15 hour days at home on my computer making new products for same niche field, after having spent an afternoon browsing online to see what others were interested in.\n\nAfter that full week of about 100 hours invested, I could go back to spending ten minutes a week answering questions for the rest of the year.  \n\nDid the same this year- spent one week with at least 100 hours invested in making new products, now just saved in drafts and I release one a week and answer a few messages. For as long as this lasts it’s been an absolute fucking dream come true. \n\nI think the key piece to my success was that I was myself looking for something on Etsy that no one else was selling yet, and I offered it for cheap ($2.99). I had no competition which meant that initially I had about a solid month of nearly a hundred sales a day. I’ve made $70k from it in last two years which means after Etsy fees and taxes that’s still about $2k/month for an averaged of ten hours a month. It ended up being more take home pay than my 9-5 job.  BUT it has no benefits or pension, so I’d caution anyone about quitting their day job if they have a pension or health benefits!",

Also in my area Rover is the only one that really gets your work anyway. Wag does not. Plus they take 30% of your money. Last year I cleared about 36k in extra income from this and look to do about the same this year. This is also with my being selective of the dogs I watch and keeping my numbers small. There are people who turn this into a real full time business! Another thing I’m considering doing is renting my driveway parking spot to long term parkers who use the airport. I don’t use it anyway and from what I’ve seen in my area you can pull an extra $300-$500 a month depending on the area and even more if you offer “free transport” to and from the airport which I would not do. There are literally so many ways to pull a few extra bucks out of the ol turnip! Good luck with your endeavors.",

          "body": "A couple I have had success with led back to leveraging a skill you have that would take too much time for someone to learn. \n\n1) Woodworking / Laser Engraving: Able to produce handmade customized items for people. A big time investment and not a lot of evergreen demand, but this year I've made an extra 14,000 in November just selling on the marketplace for Christmas gifts. Barrier to entry is tools and equipment and needing skills. Spend about 2 hours a day and 10 hours on my day off. \n\n2) Drywall repair: I focused on doing small repair jobs without paint. After a plumber or electrician came in and cut up the wall, getting a larger drywall company was difficult for customers. I would keep 2*2 sheets in my car and would tape and hot mud over a few days. I do a lot of small repairs in apartments and a couple of student houses.I reached out to contractors and painters and get 7-10 referrals a week. Usually convert 60%. Makes about 2-4k a month with materials cost of 3-500. Barrier is you need to know how to repair drywall well. It's about an hour to meet the customer and quote with a little followup. Takes about 5 hours spread over 2-3 days to do the jobs. \n\n3) Installing POS: Installing square or Shopify POS systems for small businesses. Setting up inventory management. Training. This is a great one. I can charge a premium. I network with the chamber of commerce and local fb groups. I charge $1000.00 for initial set up, and $300.00 a month for support and ongoing training. The value is that business owners are able to track sales accurately and the POS becomes critical to running their business Depending on sku count might be between 6-10 hours for the initial set up. I have about 6k a month coming in for residual income. I've used not to charge for the initial set up, but I found by charging the up front cost I was able to eliminate customers who didn't see the value and didn't want to spend money on their systems. Barrier is you need to know how the various systems work but no overhead or expenses to operate as I have my customers purchase / lease the equipment and licenses in their name. Plan a full 8 hours for the initial set up. Once set up I check in biweekly and may have to go out for an hour to train new employees or work out kinks. \n\nEdit: Added times",

It's filled with bottom feeders now because the barrier to entry has been lowered significantly with AI. \n\nI know that's not what you're asking for, BUT there is a niche within it that I started exploring early this year. It's proven to be exceptionally ripe, and now I make most of my income from that rather than convential development projects, and it even outperforms a few of my own MicroSaaS products.\n\nWhat I'm talking about is Bug Bounties. Tons of companies, pretty much all top tech firms, and tons of tech heavy blue chip companies as well offer these programs. You find a bug in one of their products, create a report, and submit it to their bounty platform. If it's accepted, they pay you, and often times, big cash. The bigger the bug, the bigger the bounty. \n\nIt's not even that hard. There is a barrier to entry, but it's not that high. With the AI race tech firms are spewing out products as fast as they can make them. The Silicon Valley motto of \"move fast and break shit\" is in full effect. \n\nI made $8500 just off the Gemini 3 launch, not just with Google but with all the companies using their AI API's on things like AI Studio and Vertex. \n\nIt probably won't last forever, I'm sure the bottom feeders will breach this niche soon enough as well. But for now there is really good money to be made.",

You basically find what some state government needs (random items), buy them, and then resell to them. Basic arbitrage.\n\nThe Model:\n\nCreate an LLC -&gt; You create an account on state/federal government contracting websites, register as a supplier -&gt; look for bids within procurement (e.g. some state government needs a trailer, wood, glass, etc.) -&gt; you find whatever the government needs online from some vendor -&gt; submit the bid to the government by pricing the material x% more than what you think you can get it for -&gt; Hope you’re the lowest bidder -&gt; win the bid and profit the difference between how much the government will pay you (your bid) and how much you have to pay the vendor you have found.\n\nKnow several people getting started in it and it has been incredibly successful for them. Feel free to look up some YT vids but do NOT sign up for a course. It’s easy enough that you can do so yourself. Don’t expect crazy margins on most items, profits will really just come from volume (so so so many opportunities there)\n\nYou’ll need ~$1500-$2000 to start (this isn’t really your expense, just what you need to buy the thing you are reselling)",

Monthly Net Margin varies depending on traffic but it’s between 1k-10k monthly with the normal average being 2k-5k/month. \n\nI could likely make more money if I focused on better training the staff for marketing (and better dealing with disgruntled customers) but I have since handed the operations over to my wife and she does the bare minimum (pay workers, manages credits, expense reports, develops promotions). Because it is profiting monthly I just let it be and I focus on my main job. I will say this has allowed her to now stay at home and manage the kids since you can do all of this thru cell phones. \n\nSomeone taught me the basics early on and I developed new strategies along the way to get it to where it is today.

          "body": "Here’s what’s actually worked for me lately with 3–4 hours a day and pocket-money tools — no hype.\n\nThe play: fix how local service businesses handle enquiries.\n\nI package it as a simple “Book-More-Jobs” bundle for one niche (dentists, physios, gyms, trades, salons).\n\nWhat I do (one week build):\n\t•\tTidy their Google Business Profile (right categories, services, photos, weekly post, Q&amp;A, tracking link).\n\t•\tSpeed-to-lead: web form → instant text reply, missed-call text-back, gentle 7-day email/SMS follow-up.\n\t•\tReviews on autopilot: post-visit text asking for a Google review.\n\t•\tOne-page numbers: a tiny sheet that shows leads, calls, show rate, booked jobs.\n\nWhy it works now: most owners already get enquiries — they just leak them through slow replies and no follow-up. \n\nYou fix that and they feel it within a fortnight without buying more ads.\n\nTool cost: Carrd/Framer + Google Sheets/Looker + Zapier/Make + a cheap SMS number. Well under £150/$200 to start.\n\nWhat I charge (real numbers):\n\t•\tEarly projects: £350–£500 ($450–$650) setup to get quick proof.\n\t•\tCurrent range: £600–£750 ($750–$950) setup + £150–£300 ($200–$350)/mo to keep posts live, monitor leads, and tweak follow-ups.\n\t•\tMy close rate from 25 personalised Loom audits is usually 1–3 clients if the audit is specific.\n\nResults I’ve seen (typical, not guaranteed):\n\t•\tReply time: hours → minutes (instantly via text).\n\t•\tShow rate: +10–30% once reminders/reschedule links go in.\n\t•\tCalls/enquiries from Maps: a clear bump within 10–14 days when the profile was messy to begin with.\n\nHow I’d test it in 7 days:\n\t1.\tPick one niche you understand.\n\t2.\tBuild a scrappy demo + 2-minute Loom walkthrough.\n\t3.\tSend 25 personalised audits to local owners (no mass spam).\n\t4.\tLand one paid job, deliver in 48 hours.\n\t5.\tCapture one metric (“no-shows down 22%” or “8 enquiries this week vs 3 last week”).\n\t6.\tAsk for a one-line testimonial.\n\t7.\tRaise price 20% and repeat.\n\nIf you want totally offline, the same logic applies to window-cleaning routes / Airbnb changeovers / mobile car valeting — sell an outcome, prove it fast, lock in a recurring slot. \n\nBut the “Book-More-Jobs” bundle has been the steadiest earner per hour for me.",

I finally found something that fits realistically.\n\nI started running wellness scans using a Quantum Resonance Magnetic Analyzer, which is a non-invasive scan that reads the body’s biofrequency signals and generates a super detailed report. I had zero medical background and it was still really easy to learn. Each scan takes 5–7 minutes and an appointment is usually 20-30 minutes total. I charge $60 per scan (you could charge more or less!) and I make a portion of the sale if I can sell the client supplements which are shipped directly to the customer from the supplier. \n\nThe service is flexible, allowing me to book scans whenever I want. The good income per scan means I don’t need to do a ton of them. There’s no inventory or driving around delivering products. People genuinely love the service and refer others, and there’s a really supportive community that helps with setup, training, scripts, client resources, and more, which made it much less overwhelming.\n\nJust to be totally upfront there is an optional affiliate side if someone wants to also earn by helping others get started, but you absolutely don’t need to recruit or build a team to make money. I just started with doing scans themselves and that alone has been awesome.\n\nRight now there’s actually a Black Friday sale where the scanner is $300 CAD. \n\nFor anyone business-minded and health-minded, this would be a great opportunity! If anyone is curious or wants to see what a scan looks like or how to set it up, send me a message!",

A tiny publisher wanted simple storybook style clips for socials and their site, two to three minutes each, calm pacing and very soft visuals,so we agreed to base everything on their “Kids Storybook” template inside MovieFlow. We agreed on 75 dollars per episode, they ordered 12, so I cleared about 900 dollars on top of my main job.\n\nThe pipeline is simple enough. They send me the story text and age range. I clean it up into a read aloud script, drop it into MF to get a first long storybook style cut, then do small tweaks in a regular editor like CapCut or Resolve Free intro, outro, timing fixes, light audio cleanup. Now that I have a rhythm each episode takes around 30 mins to 45 mins end to end.\n\nFor me this works because it is fully remote, the visual expectations are reasonable, and the heavy lifting of turning a full script into a watchable sequence sits on the tools instead of me hand building every frame in a timeline. Right now I am just treating it as a clean little sidehustle that fits into evenings without wrecking the rest of my week.",

I've tried recording videos when my kid naps and I just delete everything because I hate how I look.\n\nTried doing faceless content for a few weeks. Just text posts and stock footage. Got maybe 100 views total across like 10 videos. Everything I read says the algorithm only pushes content with faces but that's exactly what I can't do. I see these other moms posting and making a few hundred a month and I'm just stuck here.\n\n so i ended up trying APOB after posting this. basically you make a fake person and use that in videos. sounds weird but its getting way more views than the faceless stuff i was doing. still not making actual money but at least its not 100 views anymore lol",

Post your messy house and what it took for you to work up the motivation to finally clean up a little. Post as you. You may be surprised at how many ppl appreciate it.

I can't link it because the automod removes it for having a link but I already automated a Mexican restaurants recycling by setting them up with the recyclers who automatically pick everything up once a week and I get to keep the money. My main job is to get rid of the cans if the truck doesn't show up. \n\nI went to the restaurant next door and asked the owner what they were doing with their recycling and they said they weren't bothering even to recycle. He accepted but the guy wanted me to come every other day to move bottles from one side of the building to the other so I said I couldn't commit to that but turns out the owner is opening a massive restaurant next week. A 100+ table giant German bar. He said I can set up the recycling for him there. I told him in return, I'll help him out a little with their social media posts. That was good enough for them.\n\nHe asked a few questions about how I do it but I kept it vague.\n\nIt so happens a very close friend is going to start working next week as the face of the bar and I already wanted to help him out anyway! I had already given him a ton of ideas and I can do the social media posts super fast and easy but to them they think I'm some sort of wizard lol. \n\nI may get another AUD $5,000 to $10,000 out of this one. This place is 5X bigger than the first restaurant. I'm now thinking of ways to also get their other restaurant by suggesting they drop the stuff at my bins. Just need to talk to the property owner to see if he's ok with the space situation. \n\nMan. At this point I think I'm going to hit every restaurant in town 😆. It's like shooting fish in a barrell. Nobody knows of this recycling scheme. I haven't seen any of the branded bins anywhere.",

Almost zero overhead, and novel enough that people see others doing it and want in, rather than searching for a stationary place to do the same. Guy running it was cleaning up 💰",

You will have more time off than other professions and if you have children in school your vacation time will most likely mirror their vacation time. In addition, the retirement is not too bad. Many will disagree with me. I have known several people who have done nothing but hop from one job to the next for the last 30 years. I have no clue how they think they will receive a retirement. They have no pensions and have only paid into Social Security sporatically. One of my friends from high school actually had a certificate in sterlizing tools for medical procedures. I understand that the pay was decent. Unfortunately, she hopped out that job and started work for a convenience store. I think her retirement will include working in order to afford to put food on her table. I knew several people who have done the same thing as she did. It was as if it was a disease. \n\nAs far as going back to school. I knew some people in college who were older than me. No one thinks less of them. I never did. As long as you are serious about your goal it is possible. There is nothing wrong with it. You must put your mind into it and go the long haul to the finish line to get your degree, certificate, or whatever your goal is. Whatever the field is try to talk to someone who is in that field so you can get more information about and possibly how that job will do in the future.  As far as a new trade- if I were you I would make sure that I was compatible with that trade. Good luck.",

You see it on fb marketplace and basically it’s in warehouses that you go to for pick up. They also have return good from Amazon, Walmart, Home Depot that are sold by the pallets. I see people resell them a lot on flea markets. But question to ask yourself is, do you have the space to store your inventory. If your going to resell it in person you also need to figure out your logistics, you mentioned you vehicle is on the older side. If you cannot unload your pallet inventory where are you going to store it? It’s an additional cost to you if you have to rent a truck or storage unit.",

Then she told her friend who manages a small apartment complex, and that person bought too.\n\nThat got me thinking so I cleaned them up, made them more universal, and listed them on etsy back in june. Didn't expect much honestly since its such a specific thing. But property managers and small landlords kept finding them. I guess there's not a ton of options out there that aren't either too basic or overly complicated.\n\nNow I'm averaging like $400 a month from it. Some months are $300, had one month hit almost $600. I spend maybe an hour a week answering questions or doing small updates when someone requests a feature. The money just hits my account and its pretty nice.\n\nI've got some money saved up from Stаke now and I genuinely don't know how to scale this thing. Like do I hire someone to make more templates? Start advertising? Expand to other platforms? I'm kinda stuck because this whole thing happened by accident and I dont really have a business background. I'm not even good at marketing. I just wrote decent descriptions, used the right keywords, and let etsy do its thing. Thinking about making templates for other industries now but haven't decided which one yet.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been building simple niche sites + funnels for a while. Nothing fancy — $300 to $1500 range, depending on the complexity. Most clients are decent, but yesterday I got hit with something that honestly made me sit and stare at my screen for a minute.\n\nA guy messages me saying he wants a “professional website to launch his online fitness coaching.” Cool. I ask the usual questions — pages needed, content, branding, integrations, etc. He says “everything,” meaning homepage, services, testimonials, booking calendar, email automation, the works.\n\nI send him my normal quote. He replies:\n\n**“Nah man, that’s way too much. AI can build websites for free now. I’ll give you $50 because you’re basically just clicking buttons.”**\n\nI genuinely thought he was joking. But He wasn’t.\n\nHe went on a whole rant about how “AI makes web designers obsolete,” and how I should be \"grateful\" to get work while I still can. Meanwhile, he’s expecting a complete business-ready website with design, copywriting, branding, integrations, responsive layout… for the price of a pizza.\n\nWhat kills me is:  \nAI *is* a tool I use, but it’s not a magic brain that sets up hosting, configures plugins, builds a funnel, writes niche-relevant copy, fixes mobile layout, optimizes speed, adds schema, etc.\n\nThe irony?  \nHe wants to be a *fitness coach* — a job where he expects people to pay him for his expertise instead of “free YouTube workouts.”\n\nI didn’t argue. I just said:  \n“Hey, no worries, sounds like we’re not a good fit. Best of luck.”\n\nBut it really made me think about how weird the freelance landscape is becoming. People want expert-level work, ASAP, stress-free, and basically free… because “AI exists now.”\n\nIt’s not even the $50 offer. It’s the mindset that your skill is worthless because a tool exists.\n\nAnyway, rant over. Just needed to get that out. I’m sure a lot of freelancers are dealing with the same kind of wild expectations lately.",

We'll see when you'll get back to me once you'll hit a wall with hosting / database / connectors / env variables / whatever is out there.  \nEven on a simplest website the coding part is between 30-70% of total effort. Ofc for plumber business website - 4 subpages - it's like 70% maybe because the release and setup is pretty straightforward via. github / gitlab connectors to your fav. static site hosting (i love cloudflare pages).\n\nBut anything more complicated will be either blocked on this stage OR will cost A LOT of money to get through it - as even the 'cheap' website builders such as replit will lock you in behind a paywall to host your website. And once that website hits 5-10k visitors / month - costs will start to ramp up.\n\nI had like 5-6 clients which went back to me from 'my cousin set me a website and then i paid 1k$ per quarter for hosting it because he was an idiot'. No problemo, for 1k$ i can host your static page for your fancy local business forever on CF pages - and even if this would be my own hosting it'd be free for a year for the 1k$ you'll pay me for website.\n\nPPL think ai is easy to be used and do the stuff for you. But it's down to human's knowledge to drive AI towards the result. Same thing with driving a car - once you pass your license you know 'how to manage' the car to be moving. But are you able to drive a lorry? Probably not, as it requires a specific kind of training. \n\nI'm always having a good day tho after talking to ppl impyling that my prices are 'way off' and 'they'll build the website themself'. Yeah. Then after a few weeks i look into such website and i see the 'awesome' results xD and talk back to them with 'do you wonder why your website doesn't work? here's why:' kind of review. \n\ndon't worry bro, just move on and dont' waste time on idiots.",

At that price, most people will only deliver something very basic usually a simple template with minimal customization. It’s not necessarily bad, but it often means limited features, little long-term support, and a higher chance of needing fixes later.\n\n\n\nIf you’re exploring cheaper or quicker ways to build a site, tools like Code design can help you experiment with layouts and content without starting from scratch. It’s more about giving you a starting point rather than replacing proper development, so it can be useful for simple projects or testing ideas before committing to a bigger build.",

      "selftext": "Lost my retail job in April. They cut hours then just let me go. Unemployment was $280/week which barely covered anything. Rent is $1100.\n\nTried applying to other retail jobs but everything was part time or minimum wage. Decided to figure out how to make money online instead.\n\nStarted an Instagram page about budget meal prep in May. Thought it would be easy. Posted random recipes and tips. Got maybe 30 likes per post. Grew to 800 followers in 2 months and made $0.\n\nTried to monetize too early. Put affiliate links everywhere. Nobody clicked. Page looked desperate.\n\nStopped posting for 3 weeks in July because I thought it was pointless. Then randomly posted a video about making meals for under $3. It got 35k views. Went from 800 followers to 4200 in a week.\n\nStarted posting more consistently after that. Had a few more videos hit 10k to 20k views over the next couple months. Growth slowed down but kept going.\n\nBrands started reaching out in August. First deal was $150 for 3 posts about meal planning containers. Thought it was a scam but they paid.\n\nMade $340 in September from brand deals and Amazon affiliate links. Made $680 in October. Made $900 in November.\n\nAlso started doing social media management for local businesses in September. Found my first client by DMing a coffee shop that had 400 followers and hadn't posted in 2 months. Offered to run their Instagram for $200/month.\n\nGot a second client in October, a nail salon for $250/month. Then a third one in November, a small gym for $200/month. That's $650/month from freelance work.\n\nTotal in November was $1550. First time I've covered rent and groceries without panicking.\n\nInstagram page is at 9k followers now. I try to post daily but realistically it's more like 4-5 times a week. Mostly short videos about cheap meals and grocery shopping tips.\n\nSocial media work takes about 6 hours a week total. Create posts for all 3 clients, schedule them, reply to comments. Pretty easy once you have a system.\n\nStill not stable though. Instagram income varies a lot. Some months brands reach out, some months nothing. Freelance clients could drop me anytime.\n\nBut it's better than retail. At least I control my time.\n\nTime investment is maybe 15-20 hours a week across everything. Costs are around $35/month for scheduling tools and some other stuff. Recently started using APOB at $14/month for profile content.\n\nBiggest thing I learned is you can't force it. That one video that blew up wasn't better than my other content. Just got lucky with timing. Now I post consistently and hope something hits.\n\nHow do you guys find brands to work with besides just waiting around?",

A guy reached out about two months ago saying he was trying to launch a home-cleaning business and was “really strapped for cash.” He sounded sincere, said he was trying to get his first few clients and didn’t want to go into debt.\n\nI normally charge $1,800 for the package he needed. I dropped it to $1,200 because I genuinely wanted to help someone starting out. He thanked me about five times and said the discount made the project possible.\n\nWe’re now halfway through the build, and over the past week I’ve started noticing things that don’t line up with the “barely scraping by” story. He mentioned he’d been busy dealing with a “tenant situation,” and I assumed he meant his landlord. Later he casually clarified he was the landlord. Then yesterday he said he had to move some money around because “one of the rentals needed a new water heater.”\n\nIt threw me off. People who own multiple rentals are not the same people who “can’t possibly justify” paying an extra $600–800 on a website.\n\nI didn’t go digging, but his LLC info is public and his name pulls up two properties in the county records. Nothing crazy rich, but definitely not broke. He’s also driving a much nicer truck than I expected when I met him in person.\n\nNow I’m sitting with that uncomfortable feeling where you realize someone didn’t lie outright, but they definitely leaned hard into a narrative to negotiate a discount. And I fell for it because I try to give new business owners the benefit of the doubt.\n\nI’m not planning to confront him — I already agreed to the price, and the work is fine. But it did make me realize I need to be more firm about discounts and stop assuming every client asking for a break is struggling.\n\nI guess I’m just venting. It sucks when you try to be flexible and it turns out the person didn’t actually need the flexibility. It makes you second-guess your own judgment, and that’s the part that’s bothering me more than the money.",

I'm not saying to become cold hearted, but now I save the \"extras\" and discounts for the clients who have truly earned it, the startup who has been with me for a year and has been an absolute pleasure to work with, the old colleague who I run social for who didn't ask for those extra posts but I knew they'd help. Developing a website is a luxury for a business, you're not taking food from someone who pocketed a loaf of bread. If I went into a store and asked them to lower the price on a laptop because it's essential to my business and I'm a struggling startup, what would be their answer?",

I have some money aside so I'm thinking of buying even more equipment so I can rent out even more stuff, doesn't sound too bad on paper. ",

It’s a diff market with diff rules which allow them to charge so much, but the idea applies everywhere, just at a diff scale. \n\nIn terms of the smudge and any other customer damages, don’t take it personal because it’s going to happen OFTEN. Yes the equipment is technically yours, but you’re loaning it out to strangers, so think of it as an expense of doing business. \n\nIf you were an actual business, you’d have insurance which you can use insurance or right-offs to offset the cost. If not, at least have a good warranty. Maybe buy the new gear from stores with excellent warranties that allow more wiggle room with exchanging and replacing equipment. . .",

          "body": "Passive income is kind of a myth at the beginning, but there *are* skills you can learn now that can turn into semi-passive income later once you put in the upfront work. The stuff that’s actually working going into 2026 is mostly tied to digital assets you can create once and keep selling.\n\nThe most reliable ones I’ve seen are things like building small niche websites that earn through ads/affiliates, creating digital products (templates, guides, printables), learning how to run automated email funnels, or picking up basic video production to make faceless YouTube content. They’re slow at first, but once you understand the systems they can run with minimal day-to-day effort.\n\nThe key is choosing something you’re okay doing consistently for a few months before it pays off. If you want something low-cost and learnable from home, building niche sites + digital products is probably the most beginner-friendly path right now.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/is-the-wealthy-affiliate-black-friday-deal-worth-it-heres-whats-included-november-28-december-1/",

I just feel that if I could make an extra 1–2k a month, life would feel a lot less tight. The problem is when I search online, everything is “passive income guide” and it just makes me more confused.\n\nRecently I have been trying random ideas. Some people say start a faceless video channel. Some say write templates and sell them. Others say open a small online store and sell a few very niche products. Tools are also everywhere now. I can use Canva for visuals, chat tools for copy, and for the website part I could use something like genstore to spin up a basic store and then tweak the details myself. On paper it all sounds possible, but in reality I only have one or two hours a day and I am scared to pick the wrong thing.\n\nSo I wanted to ask people here with real experience. If you were in my position with a bit of starting money and limited time each day, what would you focus on first. Would you launch the simplest small site that can take payments and see if it brings in a little steady cash, or spend a long time building one skill until you can take on clients. Also curious which small projects looked good at first but turned out to be really bad for beginners.",

The only real consistent passive investment is stocks bonds and real estate (and real estate is very rarely passive unless you're incredibly rich). If you want more money a better use of your time would be: 1. Try find a partner, not only will you be happier but you'll double your salary immediately, two people working is essentially a must in this economy if you're poor. 2. Spend time upskilling, it's very rare that a passive investment will make you 12k a month without requiring lots of money to start it, but you can easily achieve a 12k increase in salary by upskilling (you can actually get much more than 12k increase in salary).

All it needs is some start capital for order fulfillment and fee to start (work hours for my team) and to be USA based. After a month or 2 you'd be making 2-3k profit per month which would be 1-1.5k for no work whatsoever. Just need to be USA with an LLC, thats it.

They host your files and both of you get money. Rates are variable by country, but 1000 downloads from the US are worth 13$. I mainly try to get traffic from there, but I also get it from all around the world which pays a lot less, but cents add up.\n\nWanted to share here because almost everyone on reddit knows about some game that has mods.\n\nThis may be your first Internet passive money, take the opportunity if you can.",

          "body": "I would look into creating and scaling your own online business which can include affiliate marketing and selling digital products. The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/is-the-wealthy-affiliate-black-friday-deal-worth-it-heres-whats-included-november-28-december-1/",

      "selftext": "Right now there's insane competition between companies trying to acquire new users. Banks, apps, games, brokerages... they all have massive marketing budgets and sometimes they compete so aggressively that the signup bonuses end up being worth more than any cost or requirement to get them. You're basically just exploiting companies overpaying for customer acquisition.\n\nSome examples of what I did last month: one brokerage paid me $75 just to deposit $25 (which I kept). A bank paid $350 for setting up a single direct deposit. And there are mobile games where you buy an in-game pack for $10 and get paid $13 back. Sounds fake but it's a real thing.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's been an easy extra few hundred each month which has helped with my grocery bill. The tricky part is really just finding these offers before everyone else flocks to them and they get capped or expire.\n\nI got tired of hunting for them manually so I built a site to track everything. It's at [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) if anyone wants to check it out. Fair warning there are referral links but all the info is free.\n\nHappy to answer any questions.",

      "selftext": "I started building side projects a little over a year ago.\n\nSome of them got a few users, but they never made money. I kept running into the same issue: I was building without knowing if people actually wanted what I was making.\n\nMy latest project is different :)\n\nI launched [my project](https://bigideasdb.com/) 7 months ago, and it made $18,000 in revenue within that time. My most successful product by far.\n\nHere's what I did differently this time:\n\n**1. Building a habit of collecting problems**\n\nI created a habit of constantly writing down problems and pain points, whether it was something I personally experienced or something I saw others struggle with online.\n\nI use a simple notes system on my phone and just add problems whenever something clicks.\n\nWhen it came time to build a new project, I had dozens of validated problems to choose from. Most weren't great, but a few stood out. BigIdeasDB was one of them.\n\n**2. Validating before building anything**\n\nThis was the biggest difference-maker.\n\nInstead of immediately building the product, I spent time figuring out if it was something others would actually pay for.\n\nI shared the idea on Reddit and Twitter, reached out to founders, and asked questions like:\n\n* Do you struggle to find good product ideas?\n* Would you use a database of validated problems scraped from real sources like Reddit, G2, and Upwork?\n* How much would you pay for something like this?\n\nThe responses were overwhelmingly positive. That gave me the confidence to move forward.\n\n**3. Listening to users religiously**\n\nOnce I launched the MVP, I stayed close to my users. I asked them:\n\n* What's missing from the platform?\n* What would help you find better problems to solve?\n* What features would make you upgrade?\n\nThis approach made it so much easier to know what to build next. I didn't waste time guessing, I just built what users asked for.\n\n**4. Obsessing over metrics**\n\nI started tracking everything: website conversion rates, user activation behavior, and upgrade funnels.\n\nI could see exactly:\n\n* How many visitors converted to users\n* How many of those became paying customers\n* What actions made people more likely to convert\n\nFor example, my landing page was only converting at around 4% early on. I focused on improving that, and after testing different headlines and features, I got it to 9%, which directly doubled my revenue.\n\n**5. Focusing on real problems with buying intent**\n\nInstead of just collecting random complaints, I focused on problems where people were already spending money or actively looking for solutions.\n\nG2 reviews showed me what paying customers hated about existing tools. Upwork job listings revealed what companies were struggling to hire help for. Reddit posts highlighted frustrations people were venting about daily.\n\nThese weren't just problems, they were validated market opportunities.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nI had to fail multiple times before I figured out how to build something people actually wanted.\n\nThe biggest change this time was validating the idea early, but combining that with real user feedback, clear metrics, and focusing on problems with proven buying intent made everything easier.\n\nIf you're still trying to get your first win, don't give up. Build small, talk to users, and make sure you're solving something real that people are already paying to fix.",

I started an instagram last summer (2024) talking about how much energy healing and yoga helped me feel calmer and more at ease in motherhood. I got a lot of traction form that and some podcast episode invites etc, started taking it a bit more serious a few months later and launched a small membership site. It was originally just yoga and meditation sessions moms could do quickly in between nap times, diapers etc., but evolved quickly after winning some outside funding  that I applied for thinking there was no shot. About 16 months from starting my silly little insta page I’m now taking my little side business even more seriously, launching a full blown alternative spiritual wellness platform made for moms of babies and young children. Hired my first 2 contractors and we pulled in about 25k this year. I am very limited w how much I work since I’m a stay at home mom otherwise so I’m only putting in like 2 - 3 hours a week on this max, even at this more “serious” stage. People make fun of passive income streams like this by saying “it’s not really passive!!” But 25k a year to only work 3 hours a week with growth every single month has been pretty solid for me and my family. Not to mention summers completely off with contractors running almost everything and growth projections surpassing 6 figures in only like 18m -24m. It’s not hard to do this stuff tbh just find the right niche, listen to whatever people’s problems are, build a strong community culture, and don’t give up. Thanks for this post bc I literally never know in context how I’m doing or if my business is even a side project or how to even talk about it. I appreciate your honesty and you taking the time to communicate what has worked for you!",

      "selftext": "I feel like a real sign of growing up is finally accepting that “passive income” is not what YouTube thumbnails say it is.\n\nOver the last few years I have tried most of the usual online ideas: blogs, YouTube channels, some crypto, affiliate stuff, dropshipping, even Kindle and Amazon. Every single thing that made any money needed me to show up again and again. Some things needed daily work, some could sit for a week or a month, but nothing was “set it once and forget it”.\n\nRight now the only thing that brings in steady money is a small dropshipping style setup targeting India. It is not huge, but it pays better than anything else I tried. Even so, it still needs at least an hour a day for ads, customer emails, small changes on the site and testing new products. When I first set it up I used a few tools to speed things up for the store page itself, including a one line website builder like genstore to get a basic store online, then I went back and fixed the details by hand. That part was “easy”, but keeping it running is not.\n\nSo at this point I see “passive income” more as income that does not need you full time, but still needs real attention. I am curious how other people here define it.",

Even the stuff that does make money still needs you checking in, fixing things, updating pages, replying to people, whatever. For me, passive income just means something that doesn’t require full-time hours, not something you set up once and never touch again. If anything, the only thing that feels close is investing, because once the money is in an index fund or Bitcoin, it grows without me doing anything.

          "body": "\"Passive income\" is really more accurately \"semi-passive income\" for most people. The YouTube fantasy of \"set and forget\" systems rarely exists at scale. What you're experiencing is the reality - successful income streams require ongoing maintenance and optimization.\n\nEven traditionally passive investments like dividend stocks, REITs, or bonds require research and portfolio adjustments. The key difference is the decoupling of time-for-money that happens in traditional employment.\n\nYour dropshipping business sounds like it's in that sweet spot - not completely hands-off, but with better time leverage than a 9-5. That's a win! The goal should be building systems where your hourly \"maintenance\" return exceeds what you'd make in direct employment, not eliminating work entirely.",

Example from last week: Guy DMs me: \"I need HubSpot set up, what do you charge?\" Me: \"Before we talk price - do you have 5-10 hours over the next month? and your team is 1-2 with 500&gt;leads\" Him: \"Uh, probably? Why?\" Me: \"Because if you do, you should DIY it. HubSpot Academy is free, YouTube has everything, you'll learn more doing it yourself.\" Him: \"Wait, you're a consultant telling me not to hire you?\" Me: \"Yeah. You seem technically capable. You'll spend 5-10 hours either way - doing it yourself or explaining your business to me. Might as well learn the system.\" He hired me anyway. Said the honesty made him trust me more. My partner: \"Stop doing that. You're leaving money on the table.\" Me: \"I'm building trust faster than I'm losing revenue.\" But honestly? I don't know if this is smart or stupid. On one hand: I've closed 2 clients in 2 months using this approach. Both specifically said \"I hired you because you told me when NOT to hire you.\" On the other hand: I've probably talked 10+ people out of paying me because I was only honest with them. That's potentially lost revenue. Am I building a sustainable business or just being naive for saying the truth that actually helps? Looking for honest feedback from people who've actually built service businesses. what do you recommend do I stop being honest?",

But, because we advertise \"senior portraits\", I get college seniors reaching out for sessions. In these situations, they are the ones paying. College seniors have 20+ student photographers at their school, offering the same service for $150. While we would do an amazing job, we're not the right fit for them and I would feel as though I'm drastically overcharging them for a service that they can get for next to nothing on their campus.\n\nBut, I also know that they only want to spend about $150 and I'm not going to provide that service at that price point when my time is better spent with clients that will invest $1500+.\n\nI could agree with you path if by turning down this business, you're capturing other clients who spend 10x on another service.

Sell your service, charge a reasonable price and offer unmatched value and education with the service. \n\n2) I bet most of them probably start, get frustrated and hire someone else who will not lead them away from what they wanted in the first place. It is shortsighted for an owner to spend time on remedial tasks to save a few dollars. I’ve learned that lesson the hard way in business. You’re probably hurting them even more adding more to their plates instead of letting them focus on growing their businesses. Smart owners deploy resources for tasks they should not be doing. Now learning how it works after the setup is vital and where you come in. \n\n3) As someone who also loves to empower people as well, know you cannot hurt your business by doing so. If a client isn’t a good fit or can’t afford your service, that’s when you can spend a few minutes empowering them to DIY. That’s what we call goodwill. So if you help them out, they keep your name in mind when someone else needs your service. But not before you try to gain the service first. You are in business after all.",

I'd start reading books by genius professors, I'm bias, because that and value investment books are largely the only things I've read but it provided me deep insight into utilizing my endless idea generation, in refining and testing ideas, choosing the \"all-in\" and eventually seeing everything through in the real order things need to be done in.\n\nFor example: you could write a decent business plan, do tons of research on competitors, build a prototype, start networking with investors, start looking for team members &amp; the list goes on. Without a framework for focus and prioritization your business can easily become a mess, regardless of your plan. I'd check out Nathan Furr's books Nail it then Scale it or Innovators Method. If you want to create better ideas/businesses, I'd suggest something like innovators solution by Clayton Christensen, although the ideas are complex and he's heavy on business terminology (hard read but very valuable).\n\nI read a book weekly now to ensure I'm always learning and staying intellectually honest.",

They also often have trouble articulating why people should care about their business as much as they do, get frustrated, and eventually give up or burn out. \n\nAs a founder, what keeps me going is my center-of-gravity. Not just making money (that can only motivate for so long), but what I stand for and against.",

I've always had a job ever since I was 14 and I made sure in every single one to do stuff that wasn't in my job description to gain experience...many times trying to get experience doing certain specific things so I could put it on my resume for the next job. \n\nThen, when I graduated high school I went to college and got a Bachelor's Degree, worked in b2b sales for a radio station for a year before going back to college to get a Master's Degree, which I graduated with when I was 24 and got an entry level job doing b2b sales with a part time bartending job on the side and started a freelance graphic design job in my spare time. \n\nThe b2b sales job was just a stop gap until I could find a Graphic Design job. Once I got the Graphic Design job, I job hopped every 2 or 3 years...Graphic Designer to Marketing Coordinator to Art Director to Creative Director to VP of Communications, which was a $100k per year gig. All the while, I always had extra income from my freelance business. \n\nAfter almost 4 years of the VP of Comms job, at the age of 36, I quit to try and do the freelance business full time...had 10-15 core clients...rebranded the business as a 'Creative Consultancy' and went very aggressive after new clients and hired a couple of talented young designers that worked for me in my previous role to work part time projects for me on the side while I sold and handled the client service side of the biz. \n\nYear 1&amp;2 I paid myself a $38k salary...luckily my wife had gotten a promotion at work from her $45k a year job to a $65k a year job, so we buckled down and made it work. Year 3 I hired my part timers on full time at $50k a year each and knocked my salary down to $30k a year. That year propelled us forward and I was able to give myself raises in Year 4 to $50k and Year 5 to $65k. The business was making money and I had enough retained earnings to stary another business with a business partner. \n\nI'm approaching Year 7 fully self employed as a 43 year old man with 2 businesses...my Creative Consultancy where I pay myself $120k and my other business where I pay myself $30k...and my wife, a 44 yo woman, is up to $75k a year. We make $225k as a household in the Midwest, own a $350k house with around $130k left on loan with 3 cars (all paid off) and a full time camping spot on a lake. We each still have $20k in student loans but I've got about $60k in high interest savings, $120k in a 401k, and 2 businesses that would sell for probably $500k and $200k respectively. \n\nI'm not rich but I live a very comfortable life that I would have never imagined growing up. I spent half my childhood in a trailer park, the other half in 3 different apartments before my parents bought a house in the rough part of town when I was a junior in high school. Both of them have passed away but they struggled with addiction their whole lives. \n\nMoral of my story is - stay curious, always be open to learning new skills and if the opportunity presents itself to start a business and go out on your own, go for it. My wife and I both spent a lot getting educated (we both have Master's Degrees) but it paid off and we have consistently moved up in our careers. \n\nMy biggest word of advice would be to stay patient. I was so eager to move up in my younger days and I got so frustrated when it didnt happen. I was 30 with a Masters Degree thinking I should be making $150k a year because I was smart and talented and I got passed up for opporunities because rich people's kids were more connected and they did it so effortlessly that it really pissed me off and I had a complex about that until I started my own business. I control my life now...and its great. I'm not rich but, from where I came from and with where I live, paying myself $150k a year aint half bad...and I'm still growing my businesses! By 50 I want to be making $300k - who knows if its possible but I'm doing everything I can to try and make it happen. \n\nHope that helps!",

If you can’t remember it after 10 minutes, don’t buy it. Etc. etc..\n2. People will pay to make their life easy if you are around a target that you want to hit find out how to make their lives easier. That is the way you become a billionaire.\n3. Rich is literally a state of mind. If you are not happy with what you have right now you’re not gonna be happy with more. I found this out the really really hard way. Make sure you’re right inside otherwise the money will just hide the crap even more And at the worst possible time the crap will show itself and the money will go away.\n\nThese three should get you started &amp; are good anchors. Your life will kind of dictate where to go once you find your wedge be very good at what you do so that they recommend you to everyone they know. \n\n\nThe thing with a lot of people who seem rich with the cars and stuff they’re not actually rich they just have access to the things that make them look rich. Most of them are cash poor. If you can build a decent nest egg of cash then you’ll be richer than probably 90% of the people out there .",

Tried various ideas to make money, but without starting with money and support realized it would probably be better to work a career and try again after getting more time and money. I found a job that I thought I'd enjoy and pay decently. You can use government data to search careers, incomes, and expected demand to find something that pays well and hopefully is growing. \n\nNow that I have a good paying job and kind of settled down I've been thinking of trying some additional ideas. I've also always been pretty good at managing and saving money and now have the time and money to start something, but even without that, based on my current savings and career path, I will reach all of my financial goals and am on track as well. Finances are a skill that can be learned, there are personal finance subs with how to do that.\n\nI suggest finding a way to earn income whether that is some formal education or something informal like through receiving mentorship through some work path. Or even start something low cost, even if you don't make much you can learn a ton. Find a way to enjoy the journey. Work on mental health to get stable and set there. Get good at managing your money. Delaying kids but finding a great and supportive partner is helpful. And as someone else said, ask those people you encounter in person how they got to where they got, and what they recommend.

Went to public school, nothing fancy. When I was 12 my parents got a new job opportunity with the same company in a capital city. It was tough the first few years, our family lived in a 2-bed apartment and my brother and I walked to school every day. But my parents started earning better salaries and then we moved into a big house with some other family members. Can honestly say the communal living arrangement helped a lot, everyone chipped in and we were super happy and close together. It also gave us the opportunity to look after my gran, who eventually passed away from cancer.\n\nWhen I was 14 I tried to find a waitering job but couldn't get hired because I was legally too young to work. At 15 I did get hired to waiter on Sundays at a coffee shop at church. I also did some photographer's assistant jobs for my friend. He couldn't pay me a lot to help him, but it opened up learning opportunities. When I finished school I didn't get accepted into university so I took a gap year and worked 4 days a week at my mom's office. On Wednesdays I would attend enrichment classes to prepare a new application for university. I finally got in and applied for financial aid, which was accepted as partly loan partly bursary. So my family didn't have to put me through uni. I worked part-time while studying - while the other students were out partying or traveling, I was grinding to pay for my stuff.\n\nOnce I graduated, I was hired full-time. I didn't have a car or much living expenses and cycled everywhere I needed to be. I started getting some of my own clients and freelancing on the side. Eventually quit my job and took my freelancing further. That was really tough but the amount of learning I did was invaluable. I made a lot of mistakes and sometimes couldn't pay rent. My clients were kind and would sometimes pay for work upfront so I could keep the business going. In the meantime, my study debt mysteriously disappeared - I didn't get any calls, I couldn't log into the portal. It's like they forgot I owed them money at all (I was faithfully paying it every month, so maybe a bursary kicked in that I didn't know about).\n\nI went on to work for a startup and that was a big jump in upskilling. Started studying part-time again and paid for all of it cash. Moved from the big city to a small town where cost of living was much cheaper. Bought a condo and a super nice car, living comfortably, have a Master's degree, no study debt.",

Success is finding your path and it’s likely rocky, full of twist and turns, so the point is to start moving forward in the right direction so you’ll eventually get there. \n\nI started working odd side cash jobs at 12/13 yrs old. I got a “real” part-time job with a W-2 at 15. I immediately hated working in restaurants, so found a job in telemarketing sales. I had a lot of sales roles from there on. I went to college and came out and worked in door to door business sales. Then I moved cities, took a random job at an insurance company, and found my professional niche that I’d later build a multi-million business around. Now almost $40NW and $4M in annual income. At no point during this time did I really know how all this sales, customer service, and insurance experience was preparing me for my future. I was just showing up and working and figuring things out. \n\nI think young people need to go work. It’s a self-selected group here but it appears a lot of people online are focused on building a company from their bedroom. If there is one piece of advice I can give- go work somewhere with ownership in mind. Work anywhere and start learning something about organization, processes, bookkeeping, employees, team building, etc. Learn what it means for people to depend on you and vice versa. Once you work it’s so much easier to see problems and come up with ideas on how to solve them.",

Here it is:\n\n**Most people will die in the exact same socio-economic bracket they were born in.**\n\nThe greatest lie American capitalism convinced us of, is that *anybody* can be rich if we just work hard enough. **Well, statistics does not support that.** About 1% of the population actually make it from poverty to financial independence. Would you set out to try to get rich if you knew there was only 1% chance or less of making it? Probably not.\n\nBut most of us have been made to believe that number is much higher than it actually is. And it works wonders for productivity - a whole nation working themselves into an early grave trying to chase the statistically unachievable dream.\n\nSo when you see rich people who've \"made it\", they're almost always born either rich or financially advantaged already. Know this. Many pretend that it was \"all them, all hard work\" that got them there, but when you dig a little bit deeper, it's almost **never** the case. They got startup money from a rich someone, had a family that could afford to send them to Ivy League, they inherited a few properties, got their first internship at uncles company on Wall Street etc, etc. True rags to riches are very, very rare (and of course my hat is off to those - but they're unicorns).\n\nSo, the lesson I took from this realization came embarrassingly late in life, I have to confess. But it decoupled me, made me wake up to a new view of it. And it was so refreshing: I've always been self-employed, but I've now shifted my focus to no longer focus so much on the end goal and the next big thing, but to have a decent time on the way there. If I can afford to feed my family, put a roof over their head, have a vacation or two a year and afford my hobbies, friends, a few restaurant visits - then that makes me rich. Sure, I'll take becoming a millionaire still, but I'm no longer chasing that dragon - I'll let the dragon come to me if it wants to, but only if it's friendly.",

You want to go from having no money (and no social status) to having money (and the social status that comes with it). That expectation might frustrate you when it actually comes to building a business.\n\nWhy do I say that? Well, most people don't ever invent nothing. Inventing is hard and requires a lot of knowledge, especially in a post industrial society in which knowledge is very advanced. Inventing can also be frustrating and don't necessarily lead to a sucessful biz. On top of that, most business fail, and fail spectacurly at that - I'm talking personal bankrupcy level here.\n\nWith that said, what is business? Business is fundamentally based on identifying a demand, building a solution, selling it to the market and delivering it with efficiency in a way that the customer will be supplied and happy.\n\nTo do that, you don't need to invent anything. You need to understand how it works, build the necessary skills, save money and basically risk it all in making it happen. There is a lot of failure and pain involved. Studying and getting a good job is a lot safer, if not easier. If you land a good job in the six figure department, you can have a good life (i. e. money in the bank, a good car and good house) without the risk and uncertainty involved in being a founder.\n\nIf you still choose to do it, start with something small and prepare your emotional skills to handle rejection (sales), uncertainty (money related risk) and loneliness (you will become different than 95% of people, probably including family and friends).\n\nOnce you do all that, brace yourself for a journey of personal development, high highes and low lows.

After 2 months I got my first client through IG DM outreach. We agreed on €80 for 3 short videos and 2 posts. I thought he’d scam me, but then my dad called and told me the money actually came. I was so happy. The client got great results and we worked together a few more months. In about 5 months I earned €250. I gave my dad €200 back and kept €50.\n\nLater I lost interest in marketing and stopped. Didn’t do anything for a few months. When I was 15 I tried again, but I had zero motivation. I stopped being disciplined and didn’t earn anything.\n\nAt 16 I bought a web dev course (€87). Finished it fast, made my portfolio, emailed clients from IG and Google Maps. But again I realized I don’t actually enjoy it and stopped. The course was good, just not for me.\n\nNow I’m still 16, spend a lot of time on games and social media. I want to work and make money but I feel like I have no motivation anymore. Every time I start something I quit fast.\n\nAny advice for my situation?",

I've watched it turn my peers, family, and would-be friends into monsters for a vapid 'opportunity' that most often never actually worked.\n\nWork on yourself, truly. Tune out the rest of the noise, and likely people that are going to tell you every single reason why you are not good enough. That is projection. We are all hurt from this society, but most especially the ones who did not have financial security. So nine out of ten times you fail simply because of self-sabotage, while the latter is to others around you trying to succeed. What you learn over time is there being a false metric that is considered as **success**. People are adamant on this division because they have been convinced (from it happening to them) that is the only way to do business. That is a flat out lie, again.\n\nThe main objective of this reality is to connect, help, and love each other. That starts by healing yourself first from the plastic society we're in. Once you do that, the opportunities will come. It will not be in the way you initially thought. But you have healed enough to see the bias previously skewing your discernment.\n\nThere are so very few who actually understand this.

There's earning potential in that industry, just I would never get it because I don't like it. Starting anew did not hold me back too much. \n\nMy husband went from one he loved to one he loved even more. He made the switch 2-3 years later than me but, but has also 5x'd his salary by now. However, he has built a way deeper foundation than me, so his upward potential is much higher. \n\nThe difference between us was, I'm only motivated to do as good of a job as I need to get promoted / retired.

My parents worked very hard and made very little but put all the money into educating me and my sibling. We took that very seriously and saw my parents working hard, so we worked hard at school -- no partying, no fun times, just pure studying. And studying was fun! I went to the best undergrad university in my country due to that, got scholarships (my parents paid 0 dollars), and then got a fully paid scholarship for a masters in North America. Once I finished that (with a 4.0 GPA), I got a pretty low paying tech job ($35K annual) but I switched jobs every 1.5-2 years, which led to huge increases in pay. After about 8 years of experience in tech, I went to a FAANG company at a management level which brought my annual pay to $400K. I'm also good with saving and moderately ok with investing, so my current net worth is about $700K. Thinking about where I started (with $0) about 13 years ago, I am very grateful to my parents for having given me the education and skills of choosing the right things to focus on which helped my life.\n\nSome key points worth mentioning:\n\n\\- I went for a mix of work experiences: startups/big corporations, client facing/backend, management/IC, etc.\n\n\\- I focussed on improving my people skills and communication techniques at every job I had. This is so hugely impactful and not very appreciated.\n\n\\- Being in cross cultural settings, I focussed on immersion into the culture I was situated in. That helped in being more adept at earning trust and being savvy with work colleagues.\n\n\\- Being curious helped me be aware of what is happening in the industry and where to go next.\n\n\\- Being always open to new opportunities and not being too loyal to a company or place helps. They are not loyal to you.\n\n\\- As I grew older, focussing on \"fun\" and \"rest\" became more and more important. People that only work hard and don't have a life burn out eventually. Before I met my wife I spent many years considering finding a partner as my main job and my actual job was a side-hustle, because I knew finding a partner is a more impactful decision than any other in life. Similarly, eating well, exercising, and spending time in nature sustain us to do well at work and ignoring those can really impact productivity.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or thoughts. \"Working hard\" is a good mantra but there are some nuances to it. Working smart, being curious, prioritizing not just \"work\" but also \"people\", and being serious about fun are all as important.",

Sometimes is not worth scrounging up for peanuts in return. And money matters in general. Only money can open certain doors and nearly guarantee success by letting you brave the waves of pushing yourself into the market as a business. My family nearly bankrupted once as we couldn't cushion a store for long enough. Two very bad years and yet months later the place boomed... Not a nice experience \n\n4) no matter how much money you have to inject, you are STILL a slave to the chaos of circumstance. You cannot time the market, only gamble. And you will always hear biased answers of those who succeeded \n\nIn general, the path from nothing is making sure you can generate as much value as quickly as possible for you to invest in a business (more work, more risk - something you should ALWAYS be aware of -, but much higher return) and repeat. You have to be bold and yet conservative, you have to move and move and make connections everywhere to catch up to people that already has that and actually compete. And then pray to whatever god you have (literally or metaphorically) for the market to be kind to you. And then rinse and repeat. Hopefully you scale fast enough, but realistically even if you succeed it will likely take a generation or two with the same drive to get there even in the best cases (discounting outliers)\n\nAs for the people I knee that made from significant to a lot of money they could not do the same today and most did so though real estate ish: one made a jewelry business (won't name her because of doxxing), another capitalized on 2001 crisis in here and bought a lot of stuff for dirt cheap and held for a few years, now he owns entire buildings. Another one got tired of being a dentist and started selling clothing to the countryside and used the money to buy property. Another one inherited a shoe factory lol but to be hair he was a programmer and likely pit quite a bit of money I to it too, another is a lawyer and got.. lucky let's say. There are others that never reached a million but still made good bucks, mostly doctors, a few engineers that migrated, a dude that bought movies for cinemas/theaters, farmers, etc etc\n\n I'm worry for being general as I don't have a personal anecdote but I genuinely don't think there something else than it.

      "selftext": "I started my first business in 2010, and have gone from having about a thousand bucks in my bank account to a paper net worth in the low nine figures (though this will come down to high eight figures after taxes). Here's my advice FWIW:\n\n**1. Learn technical skills.** Unless you're an artist or a restauranteur or something like that, odds are that the majority of your work is going to be done on a computer. As such, you should master keyboard shortcuts, use multiple monitors, set up your workspace in an efficient way, learn basic coding skills (Javascript, HTML, and SQL are all you really need), know how to model things out in spreadsheets, etc. These skills have been instrumental to me in everything I've done as an entrepreneur, and without them there is absolutely no way I would have succeeded. One of my earliest memories of my first business was a friend asking me how I was making money (he was trying something similar and failing); I could see that a lot of the reason he was failing is that he couldn't handle any of the technical aspects of what he was doing himself (eg building a website), and so was paying for someone else do do a third-rate job of it. I said \"learn how to code\" and he responded with \"but that's too hard.\" Yes, learning new things is hard, and he also should have learned how to code. Which brings me to...\n\n**2. Suck it up and do the hard things.** The vast majority of people give up when they hit their first wall. Another huge chunk drop off after the second, third, or fourth. The people who succeed are the ones who suck it up and power through the shitty parts of entrepreneurship (and it's mostly shitty at the start). I learned this during the first year of my third business, and I'm learning it again now as I'm trying to get my philanthropic efforts off the ground: there is just so much stuff when you're starting out that's a pain in the ass, and there's no one to do it but you. If you can muster the mental fortitude to just make yourself do those things, you will separate yourself from 99% of the competition and massively increase your odds of success. As just one example: can you even *imagine* how difficult it must have been to sell books on the internet in 1993? Jeff Bezos must have literally run into thousands of pain-in-the-ass things, any one of which would have deterred a normal person, but he kept at it and now he's Jeff Bezos.\n\n**3. That which gets measured gets improved.** I have kept a side scrolling daily spreadsheet of my company's P&amp;L every single day going back to 2010. If I determine that something is critical to my company's success, I carefully measure it over time, and take note of any initiative that moves the numbers in a positive or negative direction. Even if you're just starting out and there's not much to measure, measure it. Make it a habit. While it's possible to drown yourself in data overload, I think it's much more common for people to be deficient in their data gathering and analysis than to take it too far.\n\n**4. Practice good manners.** It's crazy to have to write this one out, but I can't tell you how many people I come across that don't do this. If someone emails you, respond quickly. If they help you, say thank you (in fact, I recommend signing off on all your emails with \"Thanks, \\[First Name\\]\"). If they ask for a favor that's easy for you to deliver, do the favor. Follow up with people after a good conversation. Remember to always speak to what the *other person* wants, not just what you want. (That's another head-scratcher: the number of people who will say \"Hey Chris, it would really help me if you do X and Y\" without even considering what I want or whether it's in my interest to do what they're asking.)\n\n**5. Be obsessed with your business.** I recently stepped away from my company and handed the reins over to the management team. One of the major differences I've noticed in how they do things vs how I did things is that I was *obsessed* with the business, and they're not (somewhat understandably, obviously, as they don't have my equity stake in it). When you're obsessed with your business, things don't catch you by surprise because you were already worried about them way before they happened. When you're obsessed with your business, you always have a dozen ideas ready to go whenever resources free up. When you're obsessed with your business, you become the ultimate expert at the company across a variety of topics, and can be an invaluable resource to employees / teammates. Get obsessed.",

He left his family behind, some 1,500 miles away - said he wanted to make it and seek out opportunity.\n\nWe got to chatting, told him a bit of my backstory selling across FAANG, some startups, and now being a founder. Turns out he has a background in sales and is hungry for knowledge + experience. I've been wanting to mentor a seller since I never had one myself (apart from the books I read), and this is the first time someone has actually taken me up on the offer. It's crazy considering how many people say they want to make it but don't take any initiative.\n\nI'm giving him a chance in hopes that grit and sheer determination outperform pedigree (we typically recruit from Ivy League and technical universities). I've always held the hypothesis that many people have the drive to better their lives, but not everyone has the opportunity. Now we get to test it. Anecdotally there seem to be three core elements to success in entry-level B2B; the \"Want\"; the intelligence filter; and the execution filter.\n\nI've hired him on as a BDR on a 6 month contract. By my calculations, if he's even 60% as good as I am at setting appointments, both the company and he will have positive financial outcomes.\n\nI look forward to updating the group as this progresses, and I hope this serves as a gentle reminder to take a chance on the underdog.\n\nHappy U.S. Thanksgiving to those that observe.",

More recently I got into real estate development, focusing on outdoor alternative assets. I was even designing an RV park at one point.\n\nThen shit hit the fan when our family grew by one, and I had to pivot away from that venture. I’d been working with people who were way in over their heads and outside their skill sets; myself included.\n\nOut of that mess, I ended up getting hired as a VP at a company that’s now worth 9-figures, just a little over a year after relaunch. It’s easily on track to be a 10-figure company in the next three years or less. We’re building a game-changing application of solar technology for trailers and other mobile platforms.\n\nThe CEO first saw what I could do almost ten years ago, on my first day consulting for him, when I upgraded the technical capabilities of his flagship model; changing the way he tracked his fleet (still only one in the industry doing this to this day). When things went south with the RV venture, I called him. He told me he had big things coming if I could wait it out.\n\nI did. It was brutal.\n\nBut now I’m here, developing software that’s going to help cement us as the leader in this space before we expand to other verticals. The world is our oyster at this point.\n\nSo yeah, having someone take a chance on you and proving them right is half the challenge. Proving it to yourself is the other half.",

I love you guys, you are awesome! The feedback I got was so good that the current version of the ad plus landing page is doing very well - about 6% clicks on the CTA.\n\nI've got a gazillion notifications to go through and I'll try to respond to everyone, but if I can't, I will at least *read* everything. I really appreciate the attention this got and I'll try to do a write up on my actual learnings here - the biggest ones are about being humble and asking for help.\n\n🙏",

          "body": "Many people think running ads will solve their problem. But ads only amplify what’s working (or not working) so if you run ads to an offer where the offer isn’t clear and isn’t working organically it won’t work whether you get 100 views or 100millioj views.\n\nThis ad is offering something to do with sales but the promise is not desirable. It says: win contacts on merit. \n\nNo one sits there saying I wish I could win sales on merit. They say - I hate selling, it’s hard. They say no one buys. I don’t know how to handle objections. I don’t know how to sell. I don’t know why people aren’t buying. I need someone to tell me what to say. Etc. And the language they use will be very different depending on whether they are new to selling or seasoned sellers looking to up their game. \n\nYour offer isn’t clear. I don’t know who it’s for. I don’t know what you’re solving (sales sure but what exactly and how?) your hook is not strong. And the comic doesn’t make it clear what I’m getting if I click.\n\nSo for example: Therapists: struggling to get people to say yes to working with you on your sales calls? Only booking 1 session at a time and then have to keep reselling them? Check out the simple 2step method that’s helped hundreds of therapists book out their practice and sell 6month therapy packages without cringey sales scripts or pushy tactics. \n\nOkay so I made that up completely but I want you to see: \n1. I know who I’m helping - not everyone struggling with sales - I’m helping therapists.\n2. I understand their deeper problem - people get on an intro call and don’t want to commit to more than 1 session at a time. It’s frustrating having to keep reselling and they can’t really get people results in 1 session. \n3. I understand their problem with sales - they don’t want to feel salesy or pushy or learn scripts.\n4. I have a simple two step framework to make selling easy.\n5. I have a clear result - they’ll be able to sell 6 month packages easily. \n\nNow as long as I can actually fulfil that promise and get them real results that will get clicks. But what will make it a successful business will be testimonials and word or mouth and referrals as I become known as the person who helps therapists make sales. \n\nSo if you’re genuinely wanting to help people make sales:\n\n1. Find a niche group of people who are struggling. \n2. Work with them for free (I worked with my first clients free for three months)\n3. Get them results - figure out where they’re getting stuck, what they really need etc and get them results.\n4. They will become your biggest fans and be happy to share testimonials and results and some will even want to continue working with you - paid. (Thats how I got my first paying clients)\n5. Then go and offer more people those results - you will now have a clear niche and clear promise and clear results so selling becomes easier. And you do it discounted 50% off kind of thing. You see many people do founders launches etc for this kind of thing. Get 10 more people. Get them results. Now your testimonials are growing. \n6. Now you can start selling at full price and start scaling. \n\nThat’s how I built my business coaching practice and it’s how I’m busy building my second business which is my accounting practice while still running my coaching business. \n\nIt always sucks when you try something and don’t get the results you wanted. But the key is you were brave enough to try. You clearly want to be successful in your business and you’re asking for feedback. So go and learn everything you can about making a good offer and then try again. \n\nAll the best!",

This means a dedicated strategy for gathering genuine, high-quality reviews. It’s a foundational marketing asset that makes every subsequent ad dollar work harder. For a service that specializes in this exact process, you could look into StarBrite. They are a review and referral gathering company located in Provo, UT.

Hire a marketer (or learn Meta/Google ads on YouTube) and start outreaching clients on Facebook and Google. You should have a great offer &amp; a solid landing page. You can acquire a client under $1000. Your profitability depends on your AOV (average order value).\n\n2. Build a solid cold email outreach infrastructure and start outreaching clients. Who are your clients? If they are on LinkedIn, create a LinkedIn outreach strategy to achieve your goal.\n\nIt solely depends on your niche. I suggest spending 30% of your monthly profit ($3000) on client outreach strategy and build more clientele from there.",

          "body": "Couple of approaches.\n\n1) Do an experiment with higher prices. Pick a particular proposal / upcoming project / client. Tell them that your new rates for 2026 are 20% -40% higher. There is a risk they might say \"no\" and you loose that gig, but you gain insight in to what your price should be and that is way more valuable. Wash rinse, repeat and you can maybe, over a series experiments get to the 7k extra a month you want. I would not recommend doing this for all clients, all gigs, until you've demonstrated this works.\n\nBy the way - if the client says \"yes\" they will value and appreciate your work more. Whenever I've been able to get the clients to pay a lot more, then they say \"wow that was expensive, but it was well worth it\". That's what you want.\n\n2) Do a test with a new client - charge that client two and a half times what you currently charge but give them a \"30% discount\" on that new higher price because you want to \"invest in the relationship\". That way the client feels like they are getting a great deal and you are getting closer your goals. \n\nThat way the client will really really value what you do - but also think they are getting a special deal at the same time.\n\n3) Launch something that creates stand alone recurring revenue - an app, or little SaaS type play.\n\n4) Optimize your own workflow to reduce the number of hours it takes to do your work so you have time to work on something else.\n\n5) Focus on a narrow area, with a core set of technology you can reuse across a range of different projects.",

There is a whole  bunch I can think off but here are the ones I remember right now\n\n* Gamma created a fully designed presentation for me (including all the content) from a one line prompt in 90 seconds. This was damn impressive!\n* We have an automation for my entire company using Frizerly that automatically spies on competitors to help identity content keyword gaps and publishes blogs on our website to outrank them on Google for searches! It then uses Google search console data to refine the content strategy every month based on results! It can also look at current trends in our industry and come up with blogs based on these as well! \n* A friend recently showed me voice and video cloning for hyper-personalized outreach. Imagine sending 200 customized Loom-style videos without recording each one. That’s incredible.\n* The other one that surprised me was using AI for technical document analysis. Client sends over a spec sheet or compliance doc, 80 pages of dense text. Used to be half a day of reading. Now I get a summary of what actually matters for our scope in 10 minutes.\n* 6 months ago, my team experimented with a new ABM outbound strategy by using Clay. Whenever we get contact information on a really interesting lead, we run a sequence with Clay where we automatically check if we have worked with anyone else in their industry, if we have testimonials to share, and if the company has been in the news lately too.\n* Finally, I have some come across on these tools on Reddit etc where you can just give a product url and it generates UGC videos that can be used for ads etc. It can even clone you, your voice etc. Seemed pretty cool but never got the chance to try them :)\n\nThat said, I have also come across annoying use cases like those AI that sends super personalized emails and DMs to you using public info! It was cool the first 5 times and now it's just annoying! I much rather prefer those super short emails over super long AI personalized ones!",

I took a massive pay cut because I genuinely believed in it.\n\nSpent the last few months learning everything - cold email, LinkedIn outreach automations, n8n automations , lead gen. I was actually pretty good at it too. Booked them 20-30 calls every month.\n\nBut they ran out of money and couldn't keep me on. So that's that.\n\nAlso broke up with my girlfriend during all this. So now I'm single, broke, sitting on all these skills I don't really know what to do with.\n\nMy old construction job would probably take me back. Good money, stable work. But honestly the thought of going back feels like I failed. Like I wasted all this time learning stuff that doesn't matter.\n\nEveryone says \"just freelance\" or \"offer your services\" but like... I have no clients, no real portfolio, no clue where to start.\n\nBeen thinking about doing free work or super cheap work just to get case studies and actually talk to people. But idk if that's the move or if it just makes me look desperate.\n\nThe frustrating part is I can build websites fast now, set up email campaigns that work, automate outreach - all this stuff that should be useful. But none of it matters if I don't have anyone to actually do it for.\n\nHas anyone been through something like this? Like a career change that just feels completely stuck? How did you figure it out?",

I'm flying by the seat of my pants just trying to look as professional as possible and doing good work. \n\nNow all that being said if you absolutely need cash in hand now like gonna get your ass evicted I would humble yourself, go back to the old job and get that stable check while you build yourself back up. I wouldn't think of it as failure unless you give up on trying again. \n\nI would work their while stabilizing yourself, work to keep bills and expenses to a minimum and save up for making a few years get like 3-6 months expenses fully saved up or if you can a whole year, meanwhile set up your business and start it as a side hustle where you can (I know construction usually has a lot of overtime but also sometimes you get laid off, id use the lay off time or times you don't have over time for you side hustle). Basically get reviews, get some customers in your pocket and then you have a really really stable platform to jump off of. \n\nThe first way you could make it but it's risky and you basically need to hustle like a mf to make it where the other way will take a bit longer but you'll be more stable.

Next time, have a backup plan incase the business goes under which many do. \n\nSecond, as my mother said, you are going to experience more of this in life and worse so get resilient and bounce back. Besides, you will need these type of stories to tell your kids one day when they go through this. \n\nThird, I know for a fact that construction companies have a hard time finding good talent. Get on LinkedIn and reach out to construction owners in your area or get on UpWork to look for remote work.  \n\nFinally, get out there and date. Come up with creative inexpensive things to do for your dates. The right woman with love it and share the cost. Good luck!",

Question a lot.\n\nA lot of people don’t understand that even before factoring in any kind of overhead cost the Federal Income Tax rate is 21%. If you were to go out on your own and be a sole proprietorship, you would most likely be taxed at the personal income tax rate. If you had the same take home that’s still 24%.\n\nThat’s only one piece of the puzzle. Another 6.2% to Social Security, 2.9% to Medicare for self employed individuals.  Just those 3 items alone and you’ve already lost 30% of what you thought you were going to make.\n\nYou still have to factor in any kind of overhead cost too. Insurance, designated work phone, travel expense, advertising expense, business licensing and renewals, utilities expense, just to name a few.\n\nThe reality is our company charges more because we have to. We are in an industry with high insurance multipliers and expensive equipment and overhead cost. Our take home isn’t nearly what people expect it to be. \n\nI think if you dive deeper into the numbers you’ll find your employers take from that 75% is probably closer to 10-15%.",

      "selftext": "I am 27 years old and I am both a sailor and a trader. I manage to save 20-40% of my salary plus what I earn from trading. A few years ago, I was quite enthusiastic about the field, but I have reached a point where this life no longer satisfies me. You are probably wondering why... Well, a year and a half ago, I met the woman who represents me, the kind of woman I dreamed of being with, and going on voyages has become increasingly difficult. I work one month on a ship and one month at home, and I get paid 100% of the same salary for both months. At work, I started to experience anxiety and racism. I simply wake up unmotivated. I don't want to do anything, just let the days pass and go home. The food is very bad, I always have stomach problems, and I always miss home and my loved ones. For now, I have an emergency fund that will cover my expenses for about 8 months. My goal is to reach an amount that will cover 24 months of expenses and then focus on trading and another business I want to start with my girlfriend. I thought about saving some money in addition to the emergency fund for any unforeseen circumstances in the coming year. What do you think? Am I being realistic about what I want to do? Next year, I want to start that business and gradually give up my job. Do you think it's a good idea to quit even if it doesn't pay as much as my current job, even though I have my savings?",

Most people quit a job with nothing saved.\n* Trading isn't a business, it is a legal form of gambling. Investing is putting money into things for the very long term and letting natural highs and lows average out over time. Trading is guessing the highs and lows, and sometimes picking the winners, and sometimes picking the losers. Head over to r/PersonalFinance and read the hundreds of horror stories of people who blow tens of thousands in savings chasing wins \"trading\" digital currency or stocks. At least r/wallstreetbets calls it what is is... a \"bet\" aka \"gambling.\" Get that through your skull or you'll end up another broke sob story.\n* Starting a business is hard work. Other than wanting out of your sailor career, what do you know and what skills to make you successful? What kind of business are you starting? Also, if you can start it with a person who is on the short 100% of the time, is it good enough to start NOW and let them run it when you're away, and then when you're there you bust your ass for a month? Then you build up to something so that when you quit it already exists and is making money!\n* Your girlfriend is... to be blunt... your GIRLFRIEND. Not your wife (yet). The intensity of your relationship will go up immensely when you are home 100% of the time, and even moreso when you start a business together. You're putting a lot of stock into that working out, and spoiler: business with family and romantic partners often ends badly.\n\nSo... your plan as presented here kinda sucks, other than saving money.\n\n* Keep saving.\n* We all dislike our work, whether we are self employed or not... get over it.\n* Stop gambling in the markets. It isn't a business.\n* Make a plan for your business. Test your product or offering. Do market research. Perhaps start your business anyway with a partner on the shore.\n* Have some more time with your girlfriend before you upend your life for her. Don't risk ruining a good thing by tying y'all's financial future to starting a business together.",

But that's me. You don't quite your job until you are confident the business will fulfill your needs moving forward. And not just that, but also able to fund it's growth and the hard times while still fulfilling your needs. That's not a common thing, so the default is always no.\n\n  \nNot to poke my nose where it doesn't belong, but is it possible the racism you are feeling has less to do with your race and more to do with \"I simply wake up unmotivated. I don't want to do anything, just let the days pass and go home.\" ?\n\nI mean, I don't care what your race is, but if even you describe yourself this way, i'm not going to like working with you. I would specifically try to avoid you. Very common that many would act out against you. Especially in isolated workplaces like that. And when people do that, they use anything to show their frustrations with you. Which can look a lot like racism, or be misconstrued as racism. But the root cause was that you aren't pulling your own weight. Or your attitude brings people down in a job that probably needs a positive vibe.\n\nNot trying to tell you what you are experiencing. Just trying to say you seem like a reasonable person. You might just be misreading the situation is all.",

You could lose 1 year worth of your money in one trade (depending on how risky you are). So yeah, sounds like you have the right plan/idea.\n\nIf you quit now, just make you are confident that you can get another job before you run out of money, otherwise your girl will leave you 😅",

      "selftext": "Many people know that Amazon started off by selling books. But they weren't just any books, they sold technical non-fiction books. Their first sale ever was Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies by Douglas Hofstadter, a technical cognitive-science book.\n\nWhy? Because they saw a problem in this very specific market niche. Buyers knew exactly what they wanted, but it was often hard to find these technical books at local bookstores. Amazon delivered them to you. These technical books were their beachhead.\n\nThis allowed them to prove themselves and they quickly expanded to other books, then DVDs then home goods. Now Amazon is the everything store.\n\nIf you are just starting or trying to grow your business think carefully about your market entry strategy. You can't sell to everyone at first. Find that one specific type of customer that has a very specific problem you can solve. That is your beachhead.",

          "body": "A beachhead is essential because you can't win a broad market without first dominating a narrow one. Amazon didn't become the everything store overnight. They started with a specific segment: Technical nonfiction books that local stores rarely stocked, serving customers who knew exactly what they wanted and were actively searching for it. A strong beachhead targets a tightly defined group with a painful, immediate problem, one that doesn't require educating the customer and can be reached efficiently. By solving that problem better than anyone else, you earn trust, revenue, and momentum, which you can use to expand into adjacent markets. Starting narrow isn't limiting. It's how you build an empire.",

I also used a person in the ad thinking people are attracted to a face as nobody in the entire page has that. It's just walls and walls of texts and logos. \n\nIt's been going gangbusters since day 1 the newspaper hit homes. The ad is betting me 1 to 2 new clients every day. Half of them tell me about how they got ripped off by the competitors and yesterday one client asked if what I was charging was enough and whether I wanted more, which was real nice of her. \n\nSeveral weeks ago I was starting to panic, both my wife and I were applying for jobs we absolutely didn't want to do. I'm just over the moon that something so simple actually worked!\n\nThe beauty of these clients is they keep coming back for more and tell their friends. What a bloody relief in this market!\n\nLittle bit of a side gig story but wanted to share as well.  I also found out my local bottle $0.10 refund recycling centre loans out wheelie bins and picks them up on the regular so I managed to convince two restaurant owners who weren't recycling to let me handle all their bottles and cans. Both said yes. I'm thinking I may be able to make $10,000 a year just for hooking them up with the recyclers as a middleman.",

It can completely, absolutely change your life. I mean it. Especially someone that's competent in what they do. \n\nFind someone that does marketing while you take care of the tech and some business side. Two cofounders often make a far stronger case when it comes to networking (which you need lots of times), and it's generally a far better workflow than being solo. Solo is doable but ive only seen it done by people who are truly a spark in the dark. Two is often much better, also just because of the workload. \n\nFocus on doing your things right each and you might actually get things going well. \n\nSeparately, if you can't get a quality cofounder (better someone with quality than someone that is clueless and will just take away more years or months...) then try working with a startup even if you're not paid that much to start but make sure they have grit and can get things going. This is so you can build experience in the startup scene. Takes away a lot of the imagination as well. Then whenn you go find your cofounder make sure they've also been similarly involved. Either cofounded something successful or something alike. You might even consider working with someone significantly older if that's the case. Younger successful founders are way harder to come by and will likely only jump on your boat if you're something like them. So just get started with the rigjt people first. A company isn't 1 person. Gotta start somewhere. \n\nMy 2 cents good luck stay positive",

We used to have someone on the team doing all of that, and it would eat up hours every week.\n\nWhat’s really surprised me is how much headspace opens up once the repetitive tasks are gone.

AI didn’t replace the work, it just cleared out the clutter so I could actually think again.\n\nFor example, I’ve been using ChatGPT the way you’re using it for small, purpose-built bots that keep my brain from melting. One watches competitor messaging for shifts, another cleans up client briefs so I’m not decoding chaos at 10pm, and another drafts creative angles so I never start from a blank page.\n\nI’ve also fallen in love with anything that automates the micro-tasks I used to ignore. Motion has been huge for this cause it plans my day for me based on priority and energy levels, so I actually stick to my workload instead of drowning in it. And for client acquisition, Clay has been a game changer. It scrapes, filters, personalizes, and preps outreach in minutes, so prospecting feels less like punishment.\n\nWhat’s funny is that none of these tools are flashy cause they just remove friction. And when you remove enough friction, your business suddenly feels lighter, like you’re not fighting it anymore.\n\nCurious though. Have you tried anything that automates your pipeline yet, not just your workflow?",

      "selftext": "I was broke, working in McDonalds, and desperate to break into what people call financial freedom. The idea of doing what I wanted, when I wanted, with whoever I wanted was incredibly appealing.\n\nI tried everything from trading to dropshipping to mowing lawns, but nothing worked. I was either trading my time for money or losing more money than I earned, always ending up in the negative.\n\nOne day I came across a TikTok video saying the best business to start is the one built around your hobby or interest. Something I realised later, which I think more people should understand, is that when you turn your hobby into a business you never really feel like you are working, and you end up with limitless motivation because of it.\n\nSo I started brainstorming and realised I had a valuable skill. I could go through people’s computers and find cheats or anti-forensic tricks used to hide them. This was known as PC Checking, and it was common in GTA, Minecraft and Fortnite communities.\n\nI was a checker in a few of these communities and eventually found out there were automated scanners that made the process faster and more consistent. They worked well, but they had a major flaw. False positives. Tons of them. They caused arguments, uncertainty and unresolved disputes, and the owners of these tools rarely communicated or seemed to care.\n\nBecause of that, I decided I would create a scanner myself with the lowest false positive rate possible, and I would be an active, communicative owner. That was the moment detectac was born.\n\nFirst I had to build the scanner, which took a few months with the help of my friend wirespider87. When we released it, we got no sales at all, which we expected. So I moved into the marketing stage. I partnered with Discord servers, made videos detecting the biggest bypasses at the time, and uploaded trolling cheaters on YouTube.\n\nMonth one: one sale.  \nMonth two: two sales.  \nThen it doubled every month until we hit £5k in month six.\n\nThat was the breakthrough. An extra £5k on top of my McDonalds job, but eventually the job started getting in the way, so I quit. It was the best decision I ever made. Since then I’ve kept improving detectac and today it is the market leader in PC cheat forensics, protecting over one million players across 12 different games.\n\nJust a crazy story I wanted to share to give someone a bit of motivation. It can happen to anyone if you put in enough work. Try your best, stay consistent, and you never fail if you refuse to quit.",

          "body": "Pre or post-revenue?\n\nWith me, if I'm building something new (pre-revenue) the excitement of it almost always destroys any case of procrastination. \n\nPost-revenue is a different story though. Many elements of operating a business day to day can lead to procrastination for me. But this is the perfect barometer for knowing when I need to hire for something. Hire out the repetitive stuff and keep building the exciting stuff yourself.\n\nIf you're dealing with procrastination pre-revenue you may want to take a step back and rethink what you're building. Does it actually excite you? Does it leverage your existing skill sets? Flow comes from working on things you're good at that are just slight outside of your comfort zone. If you're working on something 'too easy' or 'seemingly impossible' you may be on the wrong path.",

My money was acquired through businesses + employment almost entirely.\n\nI drive one car, I earn about 15k a month, at my peak was like 23k a month. \nIn the UK that's a lot coming out through tax.\n\nI am often the richest person I know but also act confused by how people can afford loads of stuff I cannot.\n\nThe reality is most people spend more than they make. They think once they get to 6 figures they are rich and doing well.\n\nIt's easy to make 6/7 figures through a business. The difficulty is not losing money to tax or expensive things you don't need like holidays.\n\nThe reality of money is once you believe you are doing well there almost certainly is somebody else doing better than you. When I look at things in 4 figures cost like 1k-10k I still question if I can afford it. \n\nMost people on social media show a lifestyle that really isn't normal. Maybe some are ultra wealthy, but I very often think they are in large amounts of debt. Honestly, the richest people tend to not show their wealth because you just set yourself up to be robbed. \n\nI believe ultra wealth is maybe 10 million +, but if I am really honest at my age, you could burn through that fairly quickly with lifestyle inflation.\nRecently, I took a drop in income and an on 8k a month I am spending like 12k a month and I am rushing through money fast. So I am working to get my salary back up but the reality of these successful business people is they are also 1 or 2 steps away from also being poor again.",

We are going to be expanding this rule because of the continuous onslaught of people trying to use our subscribers as an unpaid market research group. That isn't the point of the sub and the ease of creating AI wrappers or vibe coding apps has made it so bad the noise from these posts are blocking out real questions about small business. \n\nThis is particularly annoying given anyone can look at our past posts and create a map of what is important or challenging for small businesses with far greater accuracy than a single spammy \"question\" post.\n\n- Research on small businesses (i.e. asking what their challenges are, if XYZ app will help, how good your small business offering is, etc.) will be removed unless posted by legitimate academic sources. Additional rules will apply for academic research.\n\n- Posts of this type will be allowed as comments in one of our stickied posts. If these comments engage widely we may set up a new sticky for them.\n\n- We still only allow questions to be posted. Mods may post or enable non-questions for specific purposes. These are generally PSAs but can be about critical events.\n\n- As before, posts directly or indirectly for promotion will be removed, including those authored by AI. Using AI to translate might be OK but AI slop is not.\n\nAs always we welcome feedback on the rule change. \n\nAs a separate note, you might like to know we've been operating several posts as anti-spammer honeypots. These are posts are popular but highly attractive to spammers. The posts are under continuous monitoring and when a spammer makes their comment the company name or offer is banned universally across the sub. Banning the company name means even different accounts can't spam us with it. Feel free to tell folks we operate honeypots. If the bad guys know there is a risk to posting here perhaps they'll send the spam somewhere else.\n\nThanks for your posts and I look forward to hearing your comments - even the critical ones - as we always have room to improve.\n",

If they reach me, I try to tell him I don’t have a business I never have and I don’t know why they have my information, but it doesn’t reduce the number of calls I get. I wonder if they actually do any business and find people desperate enough for these kinds of Loans?\n\nOne I got a text for approval of a random number like $276,500.  I responded with, “gosh sorry I only need $260,000” and INSTANTLY got a call from a dude based in US that didn’t sound overly scammy.

If a payment didn't go through they'd call right away and threaten him (not that any of the threats were legal). My dad mostly ignored them but it still took a toll. \n\nWe're all stepping in now to shut down his business and bank accounts. We've notified the company that he's no longer able to pay but they keep calling and sending notices. My dad is gonna have to declare bankruptcy anyways so I figure they can just keep wasting their breath but other people in my family get real anxious about it. My sister even sent them a payment to \"shut them up\" ... Which worked for about a week.\n\nAll this said... I have to imagine a lot of these loans end up in bankruptcy so I'm not sure how the business works. They got back maybe $30k in payments from my dad.

They’d rather trick you into willingly giving up that money in exchange for a service. That way they aren’t easy to prosecute.\n\nThere are a few things that can happen with loan calls. Not sure which scam this is. Could just be a generally terrible loan with bad terms no one in their right mind would agree to. If it’s a standard advanced fee scam. “You’ve been approved for this loan, but we need 10% up front as a guarantee. We take bitcoin/giftcards!”\n\nAlso, of course, they’ll need all of your personal information for credit check purposes and whatnot. On the back end they will sell this info to other scammers who will use it to make themselves seem legit. “Is this First Name Last Name from X Address? I have a warrant for your arrest!”. You fell for one scam, so you’re a proven mark. You’ll get plenty of calls trying to scam you again. “Is this FN LN? You were scammed a few months ago and our records show you’re entitled to restitution! You’ll need to pay an advanced fee of course.”",

A tiny storefront, just two tables inside plus some display shelves, a small case for baked goods, an ordering/serving counter. It might have been 150 square feet or so inside the customer area plus some room out back for making drinks. Coffee was $4 or so, a latte was $5, a croissant was $4 or $5, banana bread was $3. Hours are 8 AM to 7 PM, seven days a week.\n\nAnyway, it got me wondering how businesses like this stay open. With all of the competition plus the low per-customer revenue, how does a little place like this stay afloat in a big city? I assume the rent must be thousands per month. Do they need to own the space? Am I just not thinking through the math and not realizing that multiple small purchases a day add up? Are they running on a loan they'll never re-pay?\n\nI think about this a lot with random stores in cities. Like a little boutique-type store that sells funky little gifts, candles, greeting cards, etc. How does a place like that stay open in a presumably-desirable storefront area in a big city? Are there really enough people stopping in to support it?\n\nI guess the answer is obviously \"yes\" since they are open, but it doesn't make sense to me...",

I started this small travel agency a couple years back, nothing crazy, but it somehow worked and I made like 70k over time. As I started making money I also started traveling a lot, just seeing the world, learning stuff… one of those trips was to Kenya.Someone I met there took me to this Hass avocado farm. I swear I didn’t even care about farming before but something about that place stuck with me. The trees, the export thing, the whole operation… don’t know why but it hit me.\nBefore that I was just doing the travel agency thing, but then the whole model started getting copied everywhere and abused. Margins dropped, everything felt off, so I shut it down before it ate everything I worked for.When I got back home I kept reading about Hass avocados nonstop. Like for two years. Everything from seedlings to climate stuff to yields and prices. Deep rabbit hole.Then I found some land in Ethiopia that fit everything I learned and I bought it. Honestly that moment felt wild, like “damn… this is mine.”And now I’m kinda just sitting here thinking, ok… what’s the actual next move?\nIt’s weird going from a travel agency to avocado farming. Didn’t expect life to go this direction at all.Anyone else ever make a complete switch like this?How do you know if you’re moving smart or just chasing something because it felt right in the moment?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated",

My first thought in my mind would be, is the business model safe from similar gangs like that (in kenya)? \n\nBut congratulations. Im sure business will go well. I'm no farmer. But i'd personally create a nice and memorable brand. Maybe even a funny brand. Brand all of my shipping containers. Maybe add branded stickers on every avocado. And if business goes well keep reinvesting and expanding. Buy more and more avocado farms until your brand is thriving.\n\nIf you are feeling bold id say maybe try to target european or usa buyers who may want premium quality avocados.

Not sure how hard it is to press it or what the margins are, but that could be a play for you. \n\nYou also might partner with a current export firm or a distribution partner, and work-out a revenue share by co packing or branding / licensing play. Get some bottles, simple label maker, and put their name and logo on...have them ship and sell, u just grow and produce. \n\nContact all of your prior relationships from your travel agency, such as the destinations, hotels, chefs, restaurants etc and ask them if you can send a small sample to test if they like the product and speed to destinations/ costs... maybe put 20 in a box and send them out to gage logistical issues... \n\nBeing agri product, there prob needs to be permits licensed and approved steps and stamps fro. UsDA for example... \n\nOil might be an easier play the actual produce but I could be wrong on that...\n\nIf going organic, there is a way you can apply to get permit and seal of approval, most likely from USDA as well If shipping to UsA ...\n\nJust things that are coming to mind here.... \n\nGood luck and hope it goes well for you!",

They have phased those out as well. Last year there was a veggie tray instead of dinner, and a small smattering of prizes in a drawing that only the sales team qualified for. This year they asked everyone if they wanted to go to the same place as always, a different attraction to mix it up, or get money instead of a party. Overwhelmingly people voted for money. Second choice was the new location. Not a single person voted to keep it the same as the last several years. Next day HR came out and let everyone know that they decided to do the same thing again.

My bottom line is that I do what the majority of employees want. I will travel to one of my jobsites for a lunch in the next few months. We are spread across the country in small groups, so getting everyone together is not really feasible. Frankly, I don't buy the \"cash compensation\" as these events are about the team, not the individual. I give raises and bonuses to individuals. For folks who say, \"just give me the cash\" rather than have an event, they can stay home if others want to do something. I send a b-day card to every employee with a $20 gift card for Darden restaurants. Seems silly, but it is the number one thing we get positive feedback on from employees. I think it is primarily because I write each one a card, but as I mentioned we are nation/world-wide with small groups of employees, so I encourage them to use their gift cards for a group lunch and some do. Good on you for the one-weeks bonus. We could not afford to do that, but we do most of the rest that you are doing. Hats off to you.",

They give you a real US routing number.\n3. **Looking Legit (The most important part):** Brokers don't check your tax returns first; they check your digital footprint.\n   * Get a real US phone number (OpenPhone or Google Voice) so you have a +1 country code.\n   * Update your LinkedIn location to your US LLC base (or at least make it clear you operate there).\n   * Have a clean, one-page site that highlights *process* over location.\n\nDon't overthink the 'Proof of Funds' yet. Just get the structure set up so you can sign contracts legally. Good luck!",

We just hit 40k MRR last month but I cannot shake the scarcity mindset and it's starting to affect how we operate. Like I'm talking about obsessing over every single expense to an unhealthy degree.\n\nLast week my business partner wanted to upgrade our project management software to a plan that costs an extra $200/month and I literally spent two hours building a case for why we didn't need it (fun factwe definitely need it) I just couldn't handle the idea of adding another recurring cost. She was pretty mad at me and I fully understand here I just don't know the reason behind me being like this\n\nI grew up pretty broke and bootstrapped this thing on like 3k and now even though we're profitable and growing I still operate like we're one expense away from shutting down. I review our business checking account basically every day. I still use a personal card for a bunch of business expenses because I feel guilty putting them on the company card even though that makes no sense whatsoever\n\nMy partner thinks I should talk to a therapist about it which honestly might not be a bad idea but I'm also super curious if anyone else deals with this? Like at what revenue point did you stop feeling like every dollar going out was a personal attack? Or does it never go away?\n\nThe ironic thing is I'm probably COSTING us money by being so cheap since we're definitely underinvesting in tools and people because I'm too anxious about everything? Anyone has any tips on how to improve with the way I'm dealing with everything? Thank you",

In order to grow, you should be expected to invest a certain amount back into your company. \n\nFor me, I had to work hard to change my mindset on money. Budgeting was a huge help. I committed that a % of profits would be set aside for a rainy day, and a % would be invested in our continued growth. Whether it’s hiring people, adding to our tech stack, training, etc. \n\nThat has helped as I have a set number to work with - and from there I prioritize investing in things based on the expected ROI. For example, If I add a tool for our team that saves everyone a few hours every week in admin work, they can spend that time doing something that helps our company elsewhere - like more work tied to revenue generation. If I hire someone that I can delegate tactical work to, it frees me up to me a multiplier for the company and focus on sales. \n\nIt doesn’t mean I spend like crazy, but it really helped me having a set budget in the early days that was specifically tied to investing in our growth. \n\nGood luck!",

Once I could see okay we have X months covered and we're growing at Y% and expenses felt way easier to handle. Dont get me wrong the stress didn't disappear but it got more manageable. Since you're suffering with expenses, what tool are you using? We have Ramp integrated within our company for expenses/cards which definitely helped since everything's automatic (automatic matching receipt and you can issue cards to everyone including yourself so that you can follow all the expenses way easier)\n\nAlso your partner is right about the software btw. That $20/month probably saves way more than that in wasted time. At 40k MRR after 18 months you're doing amazing!!

      "selftext": "I’m a solo design professional and I need a sanity check. I’ve never had a client behave like this and I don’t have a mentor to run this by.\n\n**The Context:**\n\n* I have a client who started construction **before** the building permit was issued. He is currently panicked because he’s risking a Stop Work Order or worse.\n* The City review process has been frustrating. The reviewer used generic \"boilerplate\" comments and didn't mark up/redline the reports, just the plans. This ambiguity caused a 3rd review cycle.\n* The City charged a re-submittal fee. It is **$150**.\n\n**The Conflict:**\n\n* The Client is demanding I pay this $150 fee out of my own pocket.\n* My contract (and industry standard) states that all agency/permit fees are the Owner's responsibility.\n* I am currently fighting the City to waive the fee on his behalf because I agree the review was lazy, but I told the Client I will not pay it personally if the waiver is denied.\n\n**The Behavior:**\n\n* He is texting me \"???\" late at night.\n* He told me \"I’m a businessman, I know how this works,\" and accused me of \"not taking ownership\" because I won't pay the $150.\n* **He has threatened to sue me.**\n\n**My Position:** I feel like he is projecting his anxiety about his illegal construction onto me. He wants me to pay the fee to validate his narrative that the delays are my fault, not the City's or his own. I’m holding the line on the $150 not because of the money, but because paying it feels like an admission of guilt/liability.\n\nHas anyone dealt with a client like this? Am I wrong for refusing to pay a small fee just to make him shut up, given that he’s already threatened legal action?\n\n**TL;DR:** Client building illegally is trying to bully me into paying a $150 City fee and threatening to sue. I'm standing my ground.",

He'll send these really friendly reminder emails asking if it's possible for them to expense it but everyone ignores them. When I say them I'm talking about my coworkers\n\nLast week he was trying to close the books for October and there were still 3 people who hadn't submitted anything. He spent like 2 hours tracking people down in slack asking about random charges from weeks ago that nobody remembers. The day after I had lunch with him and he looked pretty sad and he (I didn't brought it up) brought up how it's super hard to deal with the expenses in our company since nobody is responsible\n\nThe worst part is he's genuinely a great guy and I feel terrible watching people take advantage of how nice he is. He'll never push back or enforce consequences so everyone knows they can just submit whenever and he'll deal with it\n\nI know there's nothing from my side that I can do about this but I just want to know if I can propose something to him in order to fix this. I'm also planning to talk to some of our coworkers and ask them to be more responsible because they're literally adults WITH KIDS who are doing this.

      "selftext": "So my family's been looking at purchasing a second business. Its a reputable gas station franchise, newly established. Its a suburban area and the area has a population around 35,000 (2.5 mile radius) and nearby metropolitan city above 500k. It's near an intersection of 2 interstate highways, right off of the exit of one of them. \n\nI've been looking through the financials for the past couple of weeks, going through their franchise approval, meeting with the owners, etc and here's the basic gist of what I am expecting to get in terms of profits. \n\nThey are average in total of 123k in merchandise sales monthly. They're able to keep a 35-40% profit margin, I am getting 40% gross profit, but lets say 35%. So they're keeping roughly $43,050. The franchise takes 25% cut, leaving them with $32,288. They have 12 pumps running and are getting roughly 7,000 in their share from the franchise (franchise gives 0.05 cents on the gallon). So in a month they're grossing 39,288 before expenses. Now adding the expenses; labor (15k), card processing (3.5k), utilities (3k), operational supplies (1.4k), maintenance/repair/yard (2.8k), misc. (2k). One thing to mention is rent is really low. The location is really nice, great for a gas station traffic wise, not any nearby gas stations, but since the franchise owns the building, they say their model is to keep the rent low, so only $2,600. In that area a business like that, rent are up almost as much as 10k. So in an average month I can see myself able to keep 18k give or take. \n\nSo this is most of the information on that business I am wanting to put an offer up for. The sellers are asking $700k plus inventory. What are your guy's thoughts? Obviously I've done my research but wanting to ask from real people now.  \n\n",

Make sure this isn't on you to do if the business eventually ceases operating - it can cost six figures to do this.\n\nMy biggest concern is the rent. You have an amazing deal right now but do you have guarantees that they won't increase the rent by more than X% a year? If they make the rent reset to market rates, this whole deal isn't very good.\n\nAre there major repairs that need to be done?

Is this place running 24 hour?\n\nAre there opportunities for complementary businesses in the future? e.g. a car wash or a uhaul franchise?\n\nOverall though, the numbers look good ($700K for roughly $200K a year return) and everything passes the gut check.",

          "body": "Take your gross profit margin dollars monthly, multiply by 12 to get your yearly gross margin. You’ll get approximate business value. So say you’re grossing $20k/month (which is the right answer btw, your labour should go against direct expenses thus making your gross $24k/month),  \n\nGiven what you’ve said about the business, I would apply some nominal percent discount, I would say somewhere around 5%-10%. Wouldn’t pay more than $265,000\n\nThe other thing to consider is your labour. Are you going to be working there, or are you going to need to hire? What was your calculations on the 15k labour? If you are going to work, how many years are you expecting to do that, are you anticipating purchasing another gas station? All this should go into factoring your personal valuation for this business. \n\nAs for inventory, what is the inventory value? What was their inventory shrinkage last year? If you have a couple years of fiscal data, take the average of the last 3 years of inventory shrinkage and discount their inventory. \n\nAll being said, this business is netting around 10%, so a healthy business. Last thing I would check; what’s the nearest station, are your prices higher or lower, and what’s their proximity to major roads (freeways, etc.). If there’s opportunity to gain business then your discount as mentioned above changes.\n\nEDIT: 10% net is not taking into account owners expenses currently. Your real net, EBITDA, should be higher than 10% (at least I guess).",

That allows those questions to be answered by plugging in the SOC2 reports from those systems you work with.  \nFor example, if you are on the Google Cloud Platform (Google Workspace and everything), they all support end-to-end encryption, strong authentication, and security control surfaces.  \nSame thing for Microsoft or AWS.  \nThat allows you to check off most things and put it all on your infrastructure folks.  \nKeep in mind that many of those questions just require you to have a plan in place.  Not real discussion of what that plan needs to say.  I.e. do you have a recovery plan.  Sure, what is that?  we use voip lines, with backup from a 2nd provider.  We we have things in place, so that we can start up in a new region or new location within 72 hours.  or whatever.\n\nAnd yes, it does take one or 2 people's time.

Ads and marketing are not some magic bullet that prints money; you need to get the background stuff right first:\n\nContent - What they see / visuals\n\nCopy - What you say / offer \n\nConversion - Where they go after the ad/landing page\n\nCustomer - Who you are going after / ICP\n\n  \nDo you have all 4 ready to go?

The initial demand was for $20k settlement plus legal fees, they sent over the actual settlement agreement template and the terms are wild beyond just the money.\nAgreement requires: bringing site into \"substantial compliance\" with wcag 2.2 level aa within the term of agreement, 24 month monitoring period where they can come back and check, if you breach any terms they can reopen the case, strict confidentiality clause so you can't even tell other business owners about the amount or terms.\nThe kicker is buried in section 4 about remediation, you have to make \"good faith efforts\" but there's no clear standard for what that means. So even after paying $20k+ and doing work, they could potentially argue you didn't try hard enough.\nI talked to a lawyer who said these agreements are designed to be vague so they can keep coming back, the confidentiality clause means most business owners can't even compare notes or warn each other.\nAnyone else seen agreements like this?

What I suspect is that more people are actually fighting these claims and making the argument that the claimant is not actually being discriminated against, and this is just a cash grab due to poor ADA implementation.\n\nThus, these ongoing terms would be an attempt to legitimise the claim by making it appear that the suit really WAS about making the website compliant. I would strongly suspect that they would never even look at the website again, once a settlement was made.\n\nYour friend has a problem, because there's nothing they can do to fix their website - it's entirely down to Shopify and the theme designer to sort it, but you can bet there's terms and conditions that absolve them of any responsibility. I believe even the bits Shopify DO commit to are only WCAG 2.1 compliant, not 2.2 (which became a standard in Oct 2025, so very recently).\n\nI would check if ADA actually requires WCAG2.2 for starters, it would be unusual for them to have updated the rules so quickly after a standard became official. If not, then seek legal advice on what the implications of that are - they can't mandate you are more accessible than the law requires.\n\nI'd also petition every level of government you can, hard and frequently, about this. And get all of your small business, website-owning friends to do the same. At some point, this shit will come for them all, and the financial impact can be huge because it's almost always a open/shut technical win for the claimants.\n\nEdit: I forgot to share this, which is essentially Shopify's view on the matter: [https://www.shopify.com/news/accessibility-lawsuits](https://www.shopify.com/news/accessibility-lawsuits) \\- no answers, but an interesting read all the same.",

      "selftext": "Anyone else here ever just get depressed about running their business?  I've owned my business for 9 years now.  It has been going well.  We're profitable.  I make a lot more than I did when I worked in finance.  I generally have a lot of free time and don't work 40 hours a week (I probably work about 10 to 15 hours).  On paper it's ideal.  But, even then, it's still stressful.  Mistakes get made.  Clients get demanding.  Employees are in a bad mood.  \n\nI have a key employee that is going to move out of state in about 6 months.  I actually bought his business in 2020.  He was supposed to train me to run it, but that never really happened.  Instead, he continued to work here and, despite my best efforts, sort of continued to run that part of the business somewhat separately.  I've never really gotten the two companies to be one cohesive unit.  It's really frustrating.  I knew this guy was not the best communicator, but it's been a lot worse than I thought it would be.\n\nNow he plans to leave.  I still owe him over $100,000 and I feel like he hasn't held up his end of our contract at all.  The three guys that were his employees (and are now my employees) are not really able to work without his constant guidance.  I know the wheels are going to come off that portion of the business once he is gone.  I have a feeling all three of his guys will quit.  It's not the end of the world since I don't think any of them are that great.  But still, I know it is going to be stressful.  \n\nThe past few days I have been wondering if I should just shut the entire business down next summer.  My husband says I should sell it, and logically I know that is probably what I should do.  I had a good business for 4 years before I bought this second company.  That portion of the company will still be good and runs well.  It's also quite profitable on its own.  But, man, I am just tired right now... A large part of me just wants to walk away.  But I also have no idea what I would do with myself if I didn't have the business to run.  ",

If he hasn’t had time to show you, maybe go in and work more than 10-15 hours a week and then he may have more of a chance to show you that.\n\nSecondly, do you have a working relationship with these 3 employees, or do they pretty much just stick to this guy?

My uncles then decided for me that I need capital to grow the business, so they gave me a loan. \nThe loan, not an investment, needed to be paid back first before any dividends and they took 60% of my company. \nI was so young, I didn’t really know anything and my parents agreed to the deal. My parents know nothing about business.\nSo, uncles took 60%, I kept 30% and my parents have 10%. \nThe money went to building software that was complete crap and added no value. The business is successful, but all thanks to me. They do give some good advice though. \nAs I’ve grown up, I’ve just learned and learned how bad this deal was and I’ve grown up with such resentment. But, I was always too scared to bring this up, as I didn’t want the family the have a falling out. \nI even have to rent the office from my uncle. \nSo, once when I was 20, I wanted to move offices to somewhere neutral, but I was told “No, because then we won’t be involved and help you”.\nI then brought up 5 years ago that I want to buy shares back and they thought I was greedy. Now 5 years later, last week, I brought it up again that I want to buy some shares. \nThey told me that they can never understand what I’m angry about. In the real world, when people are desperate for money, they would handle “far worse prostitution”, and that I got a good deal and that I need to do some soul searching and see that what I’ve been feeling is wrong and that I actually lucked out. \nThe thing is, I wasn’t desperate, I didn’t even WANT it. I never asked for the loan. \n\nThey asked me to go ask “real investors” of the world about the deal and see that I’m wrong about my feelings that I got the short end of the stick.\n\nSo, as part of the research, I’m asking the real investors of reddit. \n\nI don’t think anyone will agree that this is a fair deal. And I’ve approached some lawyers to help me navigate this, but, in the meantime, for my “soul searching”, please can you give me unbiased opinions, did I get a good deal?\n\nCan anyone give me some similar scenarios?",

If there are no formal contracts I would close it down and open over the road.\n\nIf the business is worth more than you can earn in a year, then what I’d advise next (practically, not emotionally) is to shift this from a family argument into a clean business process: gather every document and build a timeline; get an independent valuation and a cap table model (what 60% was “worth” then vs now, and what you’ve effectively contributed as sweat equity); and ask a corporate lawyer to review for governance leverage points (buy-back provisions, pre-emption, dispute clauses, related-party transactions, potential “unfair prejudice/oppression” style issues depending on jurisdiction). Then propose a **structured** pathway: e.g., a staged buy-back at independently-valued prices; or converting part of their holding into non-voting equity; or refinancing their loan with a bank/third party so the company isn’t commercially dependent on them; or formalising their “involvement” as an advisory role paid at market, rather than enforced via share control and tenancy.

I saw the need to bring in help with bookkeeping, contracts, financials, etc…  This ended up being a “friend” that spoke a good game and insisted on being a 50/50 partner- which never was put on paper. I ultimately showed a flaw in my decision making by putting too much trust in him. Basically giving free range to all things and everything when it comes to money. So much so that I did not monitor anything regarding anything financial. Long story made short, I now have two maxed out credit cards, lots of questionable deposits and very unfair disbursements. Just a major problem with my poor decision making in letting him have that much power in MY company. \n\nI’ll be approaching him soon with all my findings but I want to make sure I protect myself from any further and future damage as he has all access to everything financial on me. I know to freeze accounts and deny purchase permissions. \n\nBut is there any program out there that gives alerts or guards against fraud? I wouldn’t put it past him to plaster my ssn all over the internet for scammers to grab. ",

My investors just wanted to talk to him to make sure everything was good. We couldn’t find him so they disappeared. \n\nRe-structuring, etc. cost me about $20k and I have invested about $300k YoY since 2024.

Unless your \"friend\" can come up with the money, or has assets to liquidate when/IF you win a lawsuit, I would not spend another dime on him.  Do not hire an attorney, do not hire a forensic accountant, do not throw any more money at this guy in any way, shape or form... unless you have to!\n\nConsider this an expensive lesson in owning and operating a small business and move on.  Cut the cords, the ropes, the locks, access to systems, portals, cards, phones, clients, etc.\n\nDevelop an email that gracefully dismisses him from representing your business and get ready to send it immediately after you cut him off as the leech that he is.  You will get some blow back - but once he realizes you have cut him off at every pass, he'll probably go find some other person to scam and leave you alone... Unless he has the money to waste on tormenting you.  That would be the only reason to find an absolute ball busting aggressive asshole of an attorney.  It'll cost you - but the job will get done.\n\nFinally, surviving as a small business owner in the USA today is not anything like it was 20-30 years ago.  Whatever illusions you have of fairness, righteousness, loyalty - get rid of it now. No one is going to fight harder than you to survive and win at this game called \"America\". It's a dirty, disgusting situation. In the end, there is a high probability one of you will be filing bankruptcy.  Make sure it's not you!",

Nothing crazy, nothing high-end, just fair rates for quality work with a solid reputation (250+ 5-star reviews).\n\nBut here’s what I don’t understand:\n\nWhy do so many clients feel entitled to a discount?\n\nWhen I first started, I used to give discounts whenever someone asked. But after a while, I realized something…\nPeople don’t walk into a Fortune 500 company, Best Buy, or a restaurant and say, “Hey, can I pay less?” They just pay the listed price or they go somewhere cheaper. And honestly, I would never call a business myself and ask for a discount just because I can’t afford it.\n\nIt feels pretty disrespectful sometimes, especially when you’re running an honest business, you’re trained, insured, show up on time, and provide quality work. If someone doesn’t like the price, isn’t it easier to just find a company that fits their budget instead of trying to negotiate with someone who’s already priced fairly?\n\nThis has been on my mind for a while.\n\nDo other small business owners experience this too?\n\nHow do you handle these types of customers?\n\n",

So 1 TV mounted is $xx.xx but if you pay for me to mount 3 TVs (maybe 4) you only pay $xx.xx which is 10% less than if you paid for each one individually 3 times. \n\nEven better, have a fairly set TV price, but upsell them on other mountings.

But that price is something different (higher margin ideally). \n\nYou may also want to consider unmounting/re-mounting services. Mention to the customer that you will gladly unmount any TVs when its time for them to move (apartment dwellers) and will give them a 15% discount when they want to re-mount at their new apartment. \n\nAlso, offer limited time deals for big TV seasons (Holidays when people watch Christmas movies, Halloween for Scary Movies, or Superbowl Season or March Madness, etc.)\n\nHope this helps!",

          "body": "This is a great question u/Old_Assignment_8388 .\n\nWhat I've found is that the closer the owner is to delivering a service, the higher the chance someone will ask for a discount.\n\nWhile negotiating prices can be acceptable based on industry and some customers always negotiate regardless of industry, for smaller businesses, it can cripple them because it eats into their profits.\n\nBusinesses use profits to grow and get more customers.\n\nThere are a few things a small business can do fend of lost profits through excessive discounting.\n\n1. Put prices (or ranges or estimates) on your website.\n\n2. During call, ask caller if they've had a chance to look at your services (hint hint, prices) on your website.\n\n3. If possible, give them the price before showing up and get their verbal agreement.\n\n4. If they still ask for a discount while you're on-site, one phrase that works in response is:\n\n\"I understand and thank you for asking.  The thing is, if i could give you a discount, that means I'd have been overcharging you to begin with.\" {long pause}.\n\n  \n\\-----\n\n**Advanced Tips that most small businesses refuse to do**\n\nThe problem with being the cheapest is you'd need lots and lots of customers to make up for the low profit margin.\n\nThe problem with middle of the road pricing is that you don't stand out as an expert.\n\nThe key is the provide more value than your competitors provide by addressing and doing extra things automatically.  Things your customers never thought of, but they appreciate that you did.\n\nThen, raise your prices appropriately.\n\nBeing more valuable means you can charge more with a clean conscience.\n\nIt also means more profits and revenue with fewer clients that truly value your expertise.\n\n\n\nHope that helps.",

Some people always ask to test.\n\nIf your pricing is what it is for a good reason then a polite “I’m sorry no.” If they say why not, “our rate is set at that price so we can provide quality work. How would you like to take care of the payment?”",
