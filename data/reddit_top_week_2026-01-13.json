I guarantee they will say they desperately need drivers.  The catch is is 4-5 hrs a day usually and split shift.  People hate driving school buses and kids in general.

There's no skill you can learn in a month that reliably pays $1k/month. Most of this is compounding over time. You have to go into it accepting it might not work in 1 year, maybe not even 2 - but in 5 years it will.\n\nIt's that saying \"People overestimate what they can do in 1 year and underestimate what they can do in 10\"",

Right now its capped because of time, not demand, and that matters.\n\nThe real question is this: can you remove yourself from the hours. If income only goes up when you personally tutor more, then going full time just means longer days and more stress, not scale.\n\nBefore quitting I would try one thing first. Use the job as a safety net and test leverage. Hire one tutor. Raise prices slightly. Productise something. If you can push it past the current ceiling without doubling your hours, then you have something real.\n\nAlso worth saying, last year being tougher is a warning sign. You dont want to jump just as demand softens. Build a buffer. Prove 50k plus is repeatable, not a good year.\n\nIf it still works with less you involved, then yeah, different convo. Otherwise its just a very good side hustle.",

A plumber or electrician doesnt say ok you called me and im gonna do this job for you based on what you want to pay me. They show up and investigate the situation then give you an estimate.  You gotta work on not being over eager and treat every customer like they have the money to afford your skill set. It's up to them to decide if they can or they can't. \n\nThis is where discovery time comes in. A consultation. Talk through the project. Discuss barriers that may exist. Then you work out an itemized invoice for the work. Put those details in your contract a long with your time lines, expectations for payment and any Terms and Conditions that you have set for your freelance business. \n\nTake some time to set some baseline prices for yourself. If a client wants a landing page what all does that entail? Are you providing domain hosting, email accounts? Will you have to come up with the page copy on your own. Will you have to source images? Will you be offering maintenance? Will you be providing on page SEO with the copy? \n\nTheres not a single instance for me that i would accept $300 to build a landing page. It's too important for them and requires thoughtful planning if there will be no additional pages to follow. \n\nI also only build in wordpress and have all of the Pro features  for my builder and my widgets. \n\nI chose to handle my business one way, that lets people im very good and efficient at what I do. I take my business seriously and take their project seriously. It's our job to lead them to understand why your prices are what they are and that goes beyond your portfolio. \n\nI'd advise you to stop \"Taking Jobs\"  based on what they can pay and start setting your prices for yourself and what you need to be able to operate your business and live your life. \n\nThink about getting a CRM I use Honeybook its great. If someone has an issue with my prices, at that point and at my discretion i can offer breaking it into payments that they can handle. My only policy with that is Auto-Pay must be used for a payment plan. I will shut shit down if i dont get paid. \n\nNever had an issue. I build 30-50 page sites. It got easier getting those clients when i was able to present myself confidently as a business and i put in place a professional workflow. \n\nLesson learned. Good luck.",

I don’t care how “small” a job is, you always, ALWAYS need two things:\n1) an agreed upon and *signed* scope of work detailing what is included and how much it costs, (who is writing copy? How many revisions of copy? How many revisions of design? How many revisions of wireframes? Is there content? Who is providing it? Does the project include wireframes? How many sections? Who is providing imagery? Who is going to QA? What functionality is included? What is the expected timeline?Etc. etc.)\n2) a standard creative briefing document for your client to fill in that essentially becomes the “bible” of the project. It will outline the objectives, deliverables, target audience, give info on competitors, design req and spec, budget, schedule and timeline, how hosting and maintenance will be handled, expected outcomes, etc.\n\nI know all that seems like a lot, but once you develop a standard template, it’s extremely easy to populate AND will help you manage your time AND the client better, prevent scope creep, and enable you to ask for additional budget when scope creep inevitably happens",

      "selftext": "I’m a office worker, marketing role, nothing fancy. Most days by the time I get home, eat something random, and sit down, it’s already close to 9pm. That’s basically the only time I have for my own stuff.\n\nI’ve been trying to start a small side project for months now. Not some big startup dream, just a little online store idea I kept thinking about during work. The idea itself never felt that hard, it was always the starting that stopped me. Once I thought about hosting, themes, product pages, payments, I’d just close the laptop and scroll instead.\n\nLast week I finally forced myself to do something, even if it was messy. I told myself, one night, no overthinking, just try to get something online. So I basically just Googled how to start an online store, listed out the products I wanted to try, did a quick and very rough market check, and then used genstore to put together a store page. I don’t really know much about building websites, but while I was searching I realized a lot of this stuff can be auto generated now, so I just went ahead and made a rough first version instead of overthinking it. It wasn’t perfect. The copy needs work, product selection is probably bad, and I’m sure a real ecommerce person would roast it. But when I saw an actual storefront with my idea on it, at like 12:30am on a Thursday, it felt oddly motivating.\n\nI’m still figuring out whether this thing even deserves more time. But something about having a live site makes me more willing to keep going the next night instead of starting from zero again. \n\nSo if there’s a side hustle you’ve been thinking about, maybe don’t overthink it too much. Start while the excitement is still there, even if it’s not perfect, and adjust as you go. Really believe you’ll get something out of it.",

Last week my dad asked for something he thought could make his workflow easier. So I built a simple QR tracking system for his company (plus a couple of extra features). It’s just a basic MVP, no landing page, no real auth (only invite-based access), no polish. But it does what it’s supposed to do.\n\nAnd unexpectedly, 3 other companies reached out asking if they could also use it. I ended up selling all of them a yearly plan ($199/y).\n\nI’ve never experienced something like this before. We grind constantly, try to follow best practices, iterate, polish, try to post a banger tweet or whatever… And yet this simple, single-purpose, not-very-fancy product somehow sells itself. It’s wild. I always see posts saying “it’s not the product, it’s distribution,” and I’m sure they’re right for my game dev products, but in this case things played out differently.\n\nI guess sometimes solving one real problem for someone is enough. I need to remind myself of that.",

Around March 2025 I decided to organize what I was already reading into a simple format, mainly for myself at first, just to reduce the mental overhead.\n\nOver time a few people asked if they could follow along, so I kept it going. It takes around 8 to 10 hours a week and only works because I batch everything and stick to a routine. The first few months had almost no traction, but the structure itself was useful so I didn’t stop.\n\nMost of the early growth came from being helpful in relevant threads rather than sharing links. Narrowing the focus helped a lot. Things like Twitter and SEO never really worked for me. The biggest challenge now is keeping up with it alongside a full time job and figuring out whether it’s worth continuing to invest more time into it or keep it lightweight.\n\nCurious if anyone else here has turned something they already do daily into a side project and how you decided how far to take it.\n\nEDIT : On the rebrand part. Original look was generic Canva template, tried Midjourney but text was inconsistent. Ended up using X-Design which is built for branding, took 90 mins for logo and headers. Conversion went from 1.2% to 3.8% after looking more professional. Worth fixing if your side hustle has any visual component.\n\n",

When it started creating stress or eating nights, I either scoped it down or tested a tighter format to see if it could justify more time. Helpful comments and a narrow focus beat most distribution channels early, so that part tracks.

I called it Landy AI, and the secret behind the landing pages it creates is not the page styles, although those pages are really beautiful - it is the high-converting copywriting it generates.\n\nAbout the copywriting: the copywriting is based on hundreds of successful and converting landing pages. Its language is specific for each landing page it generates - it can be professional and high-level language for business landing pages, or casual language for landing pages for the beauty industry.\n\nI have created 5 main AI agents:\n\nAn agent that analyzes the ideal client.\n\nAn agent that scrapes the web for places where the ideal client is located, reads and understands their language, and adapts the page tone accordingly.\n\nAn agent that knows the content and structure of hundreds of successful and converting landing pages.\n\nAn agent that creates the full copywriting for the page according to all the gathered data.\n\nAn agent that creates the code of the page with beautiful style that fits any device screen.\n\nAfter creating ads with my landing page that I created with Landy AI, I got a 43% conversion rate! I never thought it was possible, but it happened.\n\nYesterday, I made a webinar about Landy AI, and it went so well that I got 50 new paid customers! Right now I am on $13K MRR, and it just keeps on growing!\n\nI hope this new platform will help more people gain more conversions, leads, and sales.",

It was messy, I learned as I went, but it works because there’s a structure.\n\nA few things that might be helpful for you:\n\n* You don’t need a Social Security Number to get started — several legit platforms and processors have workarounds (especially if you have residency or a passport)\n* You already have the tech (Mac + iPhone 16 Pro) — which is all you really need to run the model I use\n* What does matter is being willing to learn marketing and sales psychology (which is what I teach my team)\n\nWe don’t just hand you a link and walk away, it’s mentorship, shared sales, and systems that duplicate. You’re never left to figure it out alone.\n\nIf you’re open to exploring how it works, I’m happy to share what I built and how I’d approach it if I were starting from your exact position.\n\nNo pressure, just clarity",

      "selftext": "I am a data analyst by profession and don’t understand anything about coding. However, I can increase or decrease the radius and font size in CSS, add a closing quotation mark in HTML, and that’s it. I have no clue what JavaScript is or why it works the way it does.\n\nConsidering the process I’m going to highlight, it may feel very trivial and basic to a real software developer. But as someone who has never done any software development, it’s kind of interesting to look back. It took almost a year to get here.\n\nEverything in the extension, website, or what you’ll read below has been developed or reviewed by AI. You still may find some grammatical errors, but if I didn’t run it through AI and you were a grammar Polizei, you would have found grammar mistakes in almost every single paragraph.\n\n# What Is This About, Though?\n\nI built a full Chrome screenshot extension. It supports visible-part capture, full-page capture, selected-area capture, and element-picker capture, with padding and delay. There is a viewer page with Copy and PDF, PNG, and JPG export and print functionality. \n\nToday the viewer page has been upgraded. It now includes full editing features. You can edit screenshots directly before exporting — crop, draw, highlight, add text, shapes, steps, and emoji — and then copy or export as PDF, PNG, or JPG, or print with quality control and padding.\n\nIt has four main components:\n\n* Website\n* Popup\n* Settings\n* Viewer/Editor page (which loads the image after taking the screenshot). This was the most complex part, but now I am very happy with how it turned out and how well it works.\n\n[Editor Page](https://preview.redd.it/xeng89rtgzbg1.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c9af2721280f18e0cf56da99e17fde7ecacdfea)\n\n# Tech Stack\n\n* Google AI Studio\n* ChatGPT\n* Visual Studio Code\n* GitHub (website edits are done through GitHub)\n* Cloudflare Workers &amp; Pages (GitHub edits are deployed to Workers and Pages, which compile the final version)\n* Resend (for contact and feedback forms on my website)\n* Apple Email (you can get cheap storage and use a custom domain, but you need to be in the Apple ecosystem or in another word an Apple user)\n* Stripe for payment\n\nEmail and payments weren’t really necessary for this. I could have simply used Gmail or Outlook, but I wanted to have a full structure like a proper company would—where everything is in place, including a revenue or monetisation system.\n\nIt’s not that I believe this will make me fully financially independent or let me quit my job and go on a world tour. But still, I want to take it as far as I can and make it as good as possible—until I can personally look at it and say, “This is perfect now.”\n\n# How It Started\n\nI started this project early in the year. I tried at least 200 times (I wish I was lying) from scratch and gave up. Looking back, I can see that having no familiarity with coding tools contributed a lot. I still remember Googling how to change the theme and font size in VS Code.\n\nAround June or July, I restarted. I already had the base and didn’t have to think about tools, where to save files, or how to compile the project.\n\n# Gemini\n\nI wrote roughly 90% of it with Gemini and 10% with ChatGPT. The website code and features are fully written by Gemini, but I used ChatGPT to translate from English to other languages.\n\n*Gemini works really, really well, but it is almost impossible to make it stop coding. Even when I mention that we are brainstorming and say “don’t make a code change in your next answer,” it still does it. I tried many variations and added rules in the instructions, but it still happens. This is the biggest frustration for me when working with Gemini.*\n\n# ChatGPT\n\nWhen I couldn’t fix a problem or implement a feature with Gemini, I would leave Gemini and use ChatGPT to explore the possible cause and brainstorm. It usually gives really good recommendations. If nothing worked, I would paste the feature code and ask for a review and a full rewrite while keeping my variables, then test a few versions.\n\nSometimes I would take ChatGPT’s code back to Gemini and ask what strategy was being used and whether it was a better approach. Sometimes I got stuck on a problem for weeks, but I managed to fix every bug using this approach.\n\n*The biggest flaw I have seen in ChatGPT so far is SVG. It just doesn’t work well and doesn’t even come close to Gemini when it comes to generating correct SVG icons.*\n\n# Claude\n\nI couldn’t really get to a level where I could test it heavily. Because few times I tried, it produced too much code and made things more complicated than needed. I still go back to it from time to time when nothing else works — but most of the time, I come in with one problem to solve and leave with 100 new ones.\n\n# What Is Important From My Perspective\n\n1. Context awareness or very large token limits are not as important as they seem: Think of this as the maximum amount of text (tokens) the AI can handle at once, including input, context, and output combined. 90% of the code was written by Gemini 2.5 Pro, which has a context window of just over 1 million tokens. That was more than enough for the scale of this project. Personally, it was much better to work on one small feature at a time instead of doing 2–3 features together.\n2. Core architecture is the most important part: If you yourself can’t understand the core architecture, some problems or bugs will be almost impossible to fix. Even if you manage to fix them, you won’t be able to maintain or update the app later—because you’ll run into the same bug over and over again, even with a tiny update.\n3. Write everything yourself in at least one language: For both the extension and the website, I personally wrote everything and then used AI to translate it into other languages. For me, AI writes like an American marketer—just too much. It’s like trying to watch an American YouTuber explain something simple; they go on and on when it could’ve been explained in under a minute.\n4. Make it first in a maximum of 2 languages, so you have the full architecture in place for adding more later: If you make any change in the code, these two files AI will usually updates as well. The more languages you have, the more time each AI response will take. But once the app goes live, this you can’t really avoid.\n5. Use multiple models.\n6. Review and clean the code over and over again: After a major milestone, remove commented code, dead code, and empty files.\n7. Ask for use cases and how things should behave: This will help you find logic issues. For example, I struggled to keep full-page capture fast. I realized the extension was stitching images during capture. I moved this step to the viewer page, and the full-page capture became much faster.\n8. Check if public libraries already exist. For PDF generation and printing to standard A4 size, I used jsPDF. It worked very well and saved me a lot of time.\n\n# One Last Thing\n\nEvery AI platform like Cursor or Antigravity or any other you can think of is basically Visual Studio Code with a different skin. So why not just use VS Code directly and avoid getting locked into another ecosystem?\n\n# What I Haven’t Tested Yet\n\nThe only thing I haven’t tested is whether the payment system actually works. I’m using Stripe, and it works fine in the sandbox environment. But it feels a bit cheap to ask friends and family cant really donate.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe space between idea and implementation has become incredibly narrow.\n\nAs a data analyst, it feels insane how fast AI is moving in coding—how far it has already come and how far it will go.\n\nOn one hand, anyone with an idea can actually build something. On the other hand, what happens to experienced developers whose bread and butter is writing code?\n\nI don’t know if this is good or bad.\n\nIf it weren’t for AI, I would never have even dared to touch this idea.",

      "selftext": "Posting this because one of my comments in another thread in this sub unexpectedly blew up and a bunch of people asked me how I ended up here. I thought it was a great opportunity to do an AMA, so here we are.\n\nMy story started as a management consultant in Canada during COVID. I worked at a lower mid market consulting firm, but the pay was honestly not great for the hours and the grind (carrot and stick) never really clicked for me.\n\nWhen Covid hit, I did what a lot of people did and tried to build something online. I did a bunch of research on Youtube and decided to I should launch a dropshipping business selling an ergonomic product. It failed for the many reasons a lot of you probably experienced. Supplier was unreliable, shipping was a mess cause of COVID, and I was learning Meta ads, Google ads, and ecomm operations all at once. Looking back, it was exactly what you would expect from a beginner trying to learn everything in real time and trying to master global supply chains during a global pandemic. Painful, but it forced me to actually understand paid traffic and conversion, which ended up mattering later.\n\nA few months after that, I came across a Twitter thread about local services booming. Plumbers, electricians, cleaners. People in trades making serious money. I brushed it off. We had just lived through COVID and the idea of strangers in homes still felt uncomfortable. Then a few days later I saw another tweet (gotta thank the Twitter algo for that or else I wouldn’t be where I am today). A girl my age sharing her story about running a remote cleaning business. No cleaning herself, just managing demand and cleaners. It sounded almost too simple, which made me skeptical. I DM’d her, we had a short back and forth, and she pointed me to a resource that made everything click and work for her. It was a course from an ex Wall Street guy who built and scaled his own remote cleaning business. I obviously did not buy anything right away. I had never bought a course in my life and was still in the mindset of having to do more research and “If he did it, I can figure this out myself”. That said, I signed up for their free content and started reading the emails. The free content and emails broke the model down in a way that made it click + paired with my own research I understood this was legit and not some other online business trap. I eventually bought the course. I am not going to promote it here, but I do want to give credit where it is due. The material and the free 1:1 calls that came with the course with the person running it genuinely changed the trajectory for me from that point on.\n\nThings moved fast. It took me about 20 days to set everything up. In hindsight, it could have taken a week. I am naturally skeptical, and skepticism is the enemy of action so I kept double checking things, doing extra research, and trying to disprove the model and what was being taught. Ironically, the more I did that, the more I realized how simple and underserved the cleaning market actually is and how all the steps make perfect sense.\n\nChoosing a market to open up shop in ended up being straightforward. The rule of thumb is pretty simple: avoid massive cities like Miami or LA. Too competitive, too many sophisticated players, lots of illegal labor. Focus on smaller cities and towns with decent population and income (there are A LOT of them). Anything under 1 million people is great, closer to 500k is ideal. The idea is to be a big fish in a small pond. As part of the selection framework you should also be looking for markets where the biggest cleaning company barely has a functional website and maybe 30 Google reviews mot. Once you find a market like that (there are plenty), you then show up with a good brand, modern looking website with online booking, and great client experience.\n\nPersonally, I picked a market and have never expanded outside of it because demand still feels endless. Cities with high rental turnover are especially good. Student towns with colleges are gold. Landlords do not clean themselves. They will pay $400 to 600 for move out cleans without hesitation. Even today, about 20-30% of our monthly revenue comes from moving related cleans. Higher ticket, easier to execute since homes are empty.\n\nFinding cleaners is usually the biggest bottleneck and the only real stress you’ll have throughout your journey. You almost always have more demand than supply, which is a GREAT problem to have, but turning down clients because your cleaners are all too busy strings. In reality, it was a me problem because I was not approaching it well. I was relying only on job boards but once I started posting in local Facebook groups, I unlocked A LOT of new applicants and found several awesome teams that allowed me to scale. A piece of advice I am very glad I did follow though was hiring cleaners before launching any ads. Finding clients was the moment where everything became real. The first two cleaners I hired are still with me today. I have always been extremely selective during the hiring process, which is what I was taught to do, and that felt uncomfortable at first, but is the right thing to do. Once you stop trying to rush this step and find the best channels for your local market, the whole thing becomes much smoother.\n\nWe landed our first client on the first day we launched ads. A biweekly client paying $140 booked online. I remember being nervous dispatching the first cleaner, waiting to see if something would go wrong. Well.. the clean went great! Payment processed after the clean and I personally called the client, thanked them, and asked for a 5-star review, explaining we were early and it really helped. He left one and has been a client ever since. He is grandfathered into that pricing forever. I will do almost anything to never lose him because of how symbolic that first full loop was.\n\nThat first month we closed seven more clients, including a few one time deep cleans. At that point I was fully hooked.\n\nHere are my rough revenue numbers, month by month.\n\nMonth 1: 3.4k  \nMonth 2: 5.2k  \nMonth 3: 7.8k  \nMonth 4: 11.5k  \nMonth 5: 14.9k  \nMonth 6: 18.3k  \nMonth 7: 22.1k  \nMonth 8: 26.7k  \nMonth 9: 31.4k  \nMonth 10: 35.9k  \nMonth 11: 38.2k  \nMonth 12: 42.6k  \nMonth 13: 39.8k  \nMonth 14: 44.1k  \nMonth 15: 48.9k  \nMonth 16: 52.3k  \nMonth 17: 58.7k  \nMonth 18: 57.4k  \nMonth 19: 55.2k  \nMonth 20: 55.0k\n\nRoughly 60% of revenue is recurring. The rest are one time deep cleans or post renovation cleanups (we got into this a few months in). We do 0 commercial right now. I want to add it this year because higher ticket recurring contracts could realistically double the business.\n\nAbout 4 months ago, I hired my first virtual assistant in the Philippines. It took about a month to fully onboard and train her. She now runs the day to day operations (not easy to “let go” but 100% worth it). I spend about an hour a day on the business, sometimes less because I only step in for rare edge cases, escalations, or when she has a question (we just text). That was the moment the business truly felt passive and not just location independent in theory. Having a high % of my business being recurring helps with the transition as things are already rolling.\n\nTwo mistakes I made early on: 1)  I underestimated how much Google reviews matter. I automated review requests and it worked, but once I started personally following up with texts and occasionally calling clients, reviews grew much faster. We were already ranking top 3 locally due to low competition, but reviews massively increased organic bookings. 2) I waited too long to raise prices. Early on I was uncomfortable charging over $50/hr. Once I realized I had more demand than supply, I raised prices to an effective $60-65/hr depending on the job. Almost no negative impact. Demand kept coming in.\n\nHappy to answer anything.\n\nEDIT (7/1): Cleaners are all independent subcontractors. I have 0 employees on payroll. They bring their own equipment and supplies (which is factored into their rate which is far above market).\n\nEDIT 2 (11/1): Thanks for the overwhelming response and all the DMs. I did not expect this post to travel the way it did.\n\nA heads up as this has been brought to my attention: there are bad actors taking advantage of the visibility of this thread and DMing people with scams. Please do not click on random links, Discord invites, or “done for you” offers. If someone is pushing urgency or asking for large upfront payments, be careful. I am also NOT interested in any consulting work nor any partnership, thus anyone claiming to be part of my “team” is lying to you. In the early hours of this post I have only replied to a handful of people who DM’d me first. I will NOT DM anyone first. If someone reaches out to you claiming to be me, do not trust it. \n\nSince so many people asked directly, I will answer this once and leave it here.\n\nThe resource I used is called Cleaning CEO University and the instructor was (is still?) named Sam. I’m not affiliated and I’m not promoting any link in public. Also, for transparency, when I joined it cost $699. It looks like it is now priced at $997. I have not gone through the content in over a year, so I cannot comment on any new material that may have been added. They also changed the name at some point, it used to be called Remote Cleaning University.\n\nWas it worth it for me? Yes. Clearly. I made roughly $1.3k in profit in month one and continued to grow from there. That said, I also put in the work, followed the process, and did not try to cut corners.\n\nIs it worth it for you? I genuinely do not know, and I cannot answer that. Please do your own research and make your own decision. A course will never do the work for you and while this is very likely one of the better ones, you’ll need to put in work.\n\nNow, what I do know for sure is that anyone DMing you offering $10k “full implementation” programs, random Discord servers, or pushing other resources aggressively is trying to take advantage of the attention around this thread and the fact that I was initially hesitant to name anything.\n\nStay cautious. ",

Margins get thinner because you are paying your cleaners well. \n\nEven if you make 100$ per job. 30$ goes into ads so basically you are making 50-70$ per job\n\nOn top of that some clients will not pay, some will pay half the amount because they were not satisfied.

I wanted to address one question that came up most often:\n\nWhat if the market I'm interested in already has a bunch of players with decent websites and a bunch of reviews?\n\nThe answer is that it doesn't matter. Just avoid shitshow markets like New York or LA. This market is so big that demand feels never-ending. There are countless cities and towns across the US or whatever country you're located in. If you're the number 10 player in the market and you're making $40k or more in revenue a month, well, who cares? You're literally making $40k or more. Ideally, you want to find a market that is underpenetrated, but trust me, most of the companies that have over 100 reviews with a decent website and running operations making over $2M are operated by amateurs or people that are not even picking up the phone half the time. Also, they have A LOT of overhead so far less flexibility and margin to play with than we do. The opportunity is endless, just execute marginally better than them and you will take market share VERY quickly.",

I’m based in Europe and thinking of either doing it here or some higher-income country. I speak 7 languages and have 7 years background in advertising. But I wonder, have you thought about expanding to other locations to expand the business? \n2. How do you hire cleaners? Ads? Job portals? Facebook groups? \n3. What kind of clients bring the most business and are easiest to work with? Which channels are bringing them for you? \n4. I would love to also know about the course. Although i’m a bit skeptical like you and thinking of looking at youtube first and perhaps ChatGPT as an assistant in setting it up. \n\nThanks so much for this post. You honestly inspired me to try this out. I feel like it is also applicable to other trade industries so I can always pivot in case it doesn’t work or gets automated with AI/robot cleaners. \n\nI know you probably get a lot of DMs but I if you find the time, would love to get the course to start working on it. \n\nI’m really keen on starting my own business. If there is a way for us to work together I would love that. Have you thought about selling a blueprint of your model? Alex Hormozi did this with his gym opening model. Made 50 mil selling that business after. \n\nAnyway, appreciate your post so much!",

Still making $350/month.\n\n# The Setup\n\n**Step 1: Find a problem** Scrolled through Facebook groups and Reddit in \\[niche\\]. Found a problem people kept asking about repeatedly.\n\n**Step 2: Create the PDF** Took 1 hour to write a comprehensive guide solving that specific problem. Used AI to help format and structure it. Nothing fancy - just clear solutions.\n\n**Step 3: Build a landing page** Used an AI website builder (just gave it a prompt like \"create a landing page to sell a PDF about X\"). Took 1 hour to get it looking right. Added:\n\n* Headline describing the problem\n* What's inside the PDF\n* Price ($9)\n* Stripe payment button\n* Automated email delivery after purchase\n\n**Step 4: Post it once** Dropped it in a few relevant communities where people have that problem. Got initial traction.\n\n**Step 5: Forget about it** All sales now come from:\n\n* Word of mouth\n* People searching for solutions\n* Zero marketing from me\n\n# Why this works\n\n* One-time effort (2 hours total)\n* AI makes both PDF and landing page creation fast\n* Stripe + automated email = no manual work\n* Low price point ($9) = easy impulse buy\n* Solves real problem = people pay\n\n# The numbers\n\n* Initial work: 1 hour creating PDF + 1 hour for landing page\n* Ongoing work: 0 hours/month\n* Monthly revenue: $350/month\n* Startup cost: $0\n* Tech stack: AI tools + Stripe + automated email\n\n# The truth about \"passive\"\n\nFirst month required some marketing. After that, truly passive. Sales happen automatically from organic discovery.\n\nSmall niche = limited scale. But $350/month for 2 hours of work isn't bad.\n\n# For anyone wanting to try this\n\n1. Find a problem people actively search for solutions to\n2. Create a clear, actionable PDF with AI help (don't overthink it)\n3. Use AI to build a simple landing page (literally just describe what you want)\n4. Set up Stripe payment + automated delivery\n5. Post in 2-3 relevant places\n6. Let organic discovery take over\n\nThe key: solve a real problem people are already looking for answers to.",

You have to heavily promote , spam and probably pay for fb ads. Today there are only a few methods that work - I am afraid this is not one of them.

          "body": "The biggest Problem with selling any digital products and especially something so simple like a PDF guide is the selling part. \n\nPeople always jump over the fact that you can't just copy paste stuff from AI tool and start selling it. Plus the marketing part such as ads or even organic traffic isn't going to turn to success on it's own. \n\nAll these posts of people making 6 figures with AI or digital marketing are too exaggerated and clickbait. I get it they do it for controversy, views and engagement, etc..But it's really annoying and makes people question everything!\n\nAnd by the time you find something interesting or worth trying out, you are already too burned out and afraid of falling for the same scam yet again.\n\nFrom my own personal research of building digital products both PDF, E-book and courses, I can easily say just from building part you have like 30 steps that you have to go through one way or the other. And just to mention that marketing and promoting comes as an extra steps on top of it all.\n\nSo, while some people got lucky and made their first few sale's with only Chatgpt most of us spend ton of time and money doing it properly. I am not saying here you can't make money without investing money or spending the least amount of time on your products but I am saying those are rare situations where people actually make it that way. \n\nJust for reference the proper way of selling digital products online include:\n1. Researching the audience/demand \n2. Researching the competition (competitor brands, business, agency's, etc...)\n3. Figuring out your product (everything from what product is supposed to be, what problems it solves and how it transformers people or their situation, etc...)\n4. Product creation (How to write, film or design your product, how to edit and put together everything, what tools you need to do all that, etc...)\n5. Figuring out market channels (where are you going to sell your product, how are you going to package it, which format, paid or free advertising or both, etc...)\n6. Content Creation if using free traffic or Facebook ads, YouTube ads, Google ads if using Paid Advertising. \n7. Consistency &amp; Growth (How are you going to connect everything and make it sustainable and long term without losing traction and how to scale it later on)\n\nAnd these are just some of the things that real business owners and content creators have to know and be able to use to reach that success that everyone has been bragging about. If we really wanted to go all in there are all kinds of important stuff still needed like AI understanding, SEO, Email Marketing, Social Media Marketing, etc... \n\nP.S This post is from my own personal experience and research that I have been doing for last 10 years.

Each website connects to a Google Sheet so clients can edit their own content.\n\nThis one feature generates $500/day mostly on autopilot.\n\nLocal business owners (plumbers, dentists, cleaners) have terrible websites. They want new ones but they’re terrified of one thing: being trapped.\n\nTraditional agencies charge $3000 upfront, then $200 every time you want to change your hours or update a price.\n\nBusiness owners hate this. They want control.\n\nThe Solution: \n\nGoogle Sheet Connection\n\nWebsites that pull data from a Google Sheet.\n\nWhen the business owner edits the spreadsheet (changes hours, updates prices, adds services)\n\nThey edit a spreadsheet. Website updates instantly.\n\nAfter validating manually (got 10 sales in the first month), built automation that runs daily:\n\nEvery day automatically:\n\n\t1.\tLead generation: Google Maps API finds 1000 businesses with outdated websites\n\n\t2.\tSite building: AI generates professional sites using their business info\n\n\t3.\tSheet setup: Apps Script connects each site to a Google Sheet\n\n\t4.\tVideo creation: Tool generates personalized demo videos\n\n\t5.\tOutreach: Email automation sends demos to all 1000 businesses\n\nMarket is massive. Millions of local businesses have terrible websites.\n\nHappy to answer questions!",

This isn’t “one click stuff”. Application scripts? To parse website data into a google sheet? Yeah that’s possible but nothing groundbreaking.  Demo videos for what??? Email automation, that’s again something anyone can quick google search for already established automation companies.

The game was good; it was noticed by the Play Store (4.5 stars) and I got several Google featuring (Editor’s Choice / Adventure). Whenever Google featured it, I saw a spike in downloads and sales. The features typically lasted from about a week to a month. As soon as the featuring stopped, I dropped back down to a very low number of sales.\n\nMy game was free-to-play (with ads), with a paid option (premium, no ads). Replayability was low (two things I would definitely change if I were to release a narrative game again). In short, the Play Store is extremely competitive — you get pushed out quickly in favor of new games. If I had managed to sustain $600 a week, I would have been the happiest developer.",

      "selftext": "So right now I make roughly between $857-$900/month renting out washers and dryers COMPLETLEY remotley.\n\nI've never seen these washers and dryers in person EVER, or even know HOW to operate a washer/dryer (yes i'm a screenager).\n\nSo I saw this video on youtube from this youtube channel that was interviewing this dude that makes like 50k/month renting out washers and dryers (revenue only) but he does all of the maintence/repairs and delivery so his margins are pretty high. If i had to guess he probably inflated his numbers in some way to sell a shiny object syndrome dream because he has a skool community course that he sells but the business that he operates is for sure profitable.\n\nThe other caviot is that he has his own trailor/scrap yard for storage/hauling, and used to work as a dryer/washer repair tech so all of his repairs are \"free\" (done by him). I don't have any of that but I could defintley afford it (I have 57k in savings from other side hustles and some luck).\n\nThe whole video wasn't SUPER helpful, besides the facebook marketplace segment, where the guy showcases how he does his FREE organic advertising on facebook to do 50k/month in RV, and as someone who has multiple accounts on facebook listing washer and dryer rentals, I can vouch that I get over 30+ inquiries a day from 5 facebook account and don't usually have time/forget to respond to prospects. (im in texas)\n\nSince I didnt have a truck or storage unit, I cold called a few washer and dryer wholesellers on google maps and worked out an agreement, I know its a killer deal but he charges me $400 for a SET of washers and dryers (amanas and whirlpools), and $50 to INSTALL them. (Yes I've been told by many people that this is a crazy deal), and he also doesn't charge me for storage if anyone ever defaults and I have no where else to send my washers and dryers too.\n\nRight now, I've been sitting on a set of 6 washers and dryers and do a \"rent to own\" business model, in which most people default out of. Here are my payment options:\n\n$104/month rent to own for 12 months (nobody gets this)\n\n$80/month rent to own for 18 months (8 people have this)\n\n$65/month rent to own for 24 months (2 people have this)\n\nOne thing I have noticed is that people DO screw you over in this business model, but it usually is not TOO terrible.\n\nThe only time I have been screwed over is when I had a few people sign a contract for a 1 or 2 year lease on the washer or dryer and they default after the FIRST month because they ran out of money (which is destined in this market segment), or they bought their own washer and dryer (wtf???)\n\nSo another thing I do is charge DOUBLE the security deposit, so if someone asks for $80/month, I charge them $160 for delivery and install (everything is through stripe). This obviously leads to fewer conversions but there are still ALOT of people out there that will be more than willing to pay $160 for the delivery and install. ($80 one time payment, $80 reccuring payment). This removes all risk for THIS instance because my maximum downside is $100 ($50 for the install and $50 for my delivery guy to remove it). Obviously there is a risk of them just \"stealing\" the washer and dryer, which is ALOT more likley because of the targeted market segment (low income people).\n\nI've never gotten a washer or dryer \"stolen\", it's just not something that happens, but if it does happen, I told each customer that I have a kill switch on them (I don't but I'm sure this deters them from doing so)however I know this is defintely NOT full proof and I am brainstorming a solution. (I'm sure its not super hard to set up). I've cycled through 18 people over the course of the last 5 months, and as I said earlier, I still profit $60 even if I get screwed on the first month.\n\nI've been doing this for 5 months now so my sets JUST broke even (not by that much), so next month will be my first month of REAL profit.\n\nHere is my \"funnel\" or so you call it.\n\nCustomer reaches out on facebook marketplace ---&gt; I send them the prices ---&gt;they pick an option and then typically ask for same day delivery --&gt; I collect their address and number, call them then charge them a premium for same day delivery --&gt; I send them the payment portal to pay the double deposit (some customers prefer to do it when we are on site but I always try to do it before i dispatch my delivery guy) --&gt; I dispatch my delivery guy --&gt; delivery guy installs washer and dryer.--&gt; I send customer contract.\n\nSome more general tips:\n\n\\-MAKE SURE that the customer pays you MORE than what it costs for you to deliver and repo the unit if you are doing it through a third party like I did.\n\n\\-facebook market place is your BEST friend, please do not pay for ANY advertising.\n\n\\-get on the phone with the customer to build trust (nobody is going to send you $160 from just texting)\n\n\\-Call at LEAST 5 washer/dryer wholesellers to get the best prices on USED sets.\n\nI'm thinking about scaling another 10 or so washer and dryer sets over the next 3 months and implmenting ACTUAL kill switches (this will be the first time I ever see any of my washer and dryers).\n\nEdit: I believe this constitutes as passive income because after all of the set up(phone calls, messaging, document signing), it’s hands off) ",

On average I’m around $1,000/month, and more importantly the process compounds as account size grows. With conservative deltas and liquid names, \\~1–2% per month is very realistic if you don’t chase premium. Below is proof.\n\nObviously:\n\n* Account size matters\n* Risk management matters\n* This is not free money\n\nBut compared to a lot of “passive income” ideas that rely on hard work, creating saas, freelancing, real estate and tenant, platform risk,  etc etc  I’m surprised this strategy barely shows up here.\n\nFor transparency, I’ve made my results public on my profile so people can judge for themselves.\n\nHappy to discuss risks, downsides, or why people here avoid it.\n\nproof: [https://optionwheeltracker.com/trader/brotrader](https://optionwheeltracker.com/trader/brotrader) (not a referral link - not selling anything here)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ws1uhc5fksbg1.png?width=3024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2fbb5cc267eba9248878be465d4b785a90985e6\n\n",

I have found premiums to be higher on cash secured puts than on covered calls, but at this time I have more covered calls than cash secured puts sitting out there as my puts always seem to get assigned (which is more or less part of my strategy).",

I pick the underlying stocks following a refining process that I'm still improving:\n\n1. Pick underlying stocks: I wrote a program to screen stocks based on some of my own formula and no earnings coming out before the expiration date (my formula calculates a value similar to IV so higher value implies higher premiums). Or sometimes I just pick the ones I'm more familiar with and repeatedly traded before;\n2. Further refining: Pick those with 1% - 1.5% biweekly premium. (Don't chase higher premiums and avoid pharmacy stocks. I've been bitten by those.)\n3. Then: Look at fundamentals. Select a few with good fundamentals or I'm confident / familiar with its financials.\n4. Next: Review technical charts and find the patterns that I like.\n5. Finally: ask Chatgpt if any meaningful events will happen before the expiration date (for example debt maturity). (Sometimes a future event will make the premium high)\n\nAt this point I'll have 3 - 5 stocks I'll sell CSP.\n\nI close or roll the position if I the stock falls to near or below the striking, or I have 80%+ profit, or the premium for the rest of the days is too low to hold. I very rarely get assigned.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. Don't chase high premiums.\n2. The game is in a way that you can win 10 times, but one loss could wipe most of the gains if not all, so need to be extra cautious with losing positions, epecially when the market is on a downhill where you have higher chance to loss.\n3. I trade in a margin account where my money is fully invested, and I use the margins to secure puts. The good thing is that you are not actually using the brokers money so it is interest free. So if you can boost your total return by a few percent with CSP that is still a win. The bad thing is that you have to be extra cautious with margins. I usually use a margin within 30% of my account value.",

I always research the stocks and sell puts based on that.  Great comments on \"don't chase premiums\".  I have learned to fine tune how I do the strategy.  One comment for everyone.  I do this because it is fun for me and I make money.  However, this should not replace your 401K or your retirement savings.  This should be done with money you could afford to lose.  I know this sounds strange, but it is important to understand.  In reality it would be hard to lose all your money unless the company goes bankrupt.  I also spend like 30 minutes a day.

      "selftext": "I work a pretty boring corporate job in logistics. good salary but soul crushing. always wanted to do something creative on the side but honestly I have zero interest in being on camera. like none. my face is not going on the internet, period. so I spent a lot of time researching faceless content and kept seeing people talk about AI generated stuff.\n\nthe idea came from my girlfriend actually. she follows a ton of fashion accounts on instagram and pointed out that some of them looked kinda off. like the models were too perfect or the lighting was weird. turned out a bunch of them were using AI generated images. that got me thinking.\n\nso around january last year I decided to start a fitness motivation account. yeah I know, super saturated niche. but I figured the content would be easier to create since its mostly just aesthetic photos with motivational quotes. nothing groundbreaking.\n\nthe first three months were rough. I was using midjourney and some other tools to generate fitness model images but the problem was consistency. every image looked like a different person. followers would comment stuff like “who is this” or “thought this was a different girl” and it killed any sense of brand identity. I almost quit around month two because the engagement was terrible and I was spending like 2 hours a day just trying to get usable images.\n\nmonth four I started experimenting with different approaches. tried a bunch of tools like APOB, artbreeder, and some others I found on reddit. the game changer was figuring out how to maintain a consistent character across posts. once I locked in “her” look (athletic build, dark hair, mid 20s vibe) things started clicking. people actually started following because they thought they were following a real person’s fitness journey.\n\nthe content strategy was simple. post once a day, always the same “person” in different workout settings or athleisure outfits. gym shots, outdoor runs, yoga poses, that kind of thing. captions were either motivational quotes or fake personal stories about “my” fitness journey. felt a little weird at first writing in first person as this fictional character but honestly nobody questioned it.\n\nmonth six I hit 8k followers which qualified me for some micro influencer platforms. got my first brand deal for $75 to post about a protein powder. the brand sent product shots and I just had to incorporate their messaging. easy money for like 20 minutes of work.\n\nthe income breakdown right now at month 11:\n\nbrand deals: averaging about $280/month. I get maybe 4 to 5 offers per month, accept 2 or 3 that actually fit the account aesthetic. pay ranges from $50 to $120 per post depending on the brand.\n\naffiliate links: around $60/month from amazon associates. I link workout gear and supplements in my bio and stories. conversion rate is garbage honestly but it adds up.\n\nso total is roughly $340/month. not quitting my job money but considering I spend maybe 45 minutes a day on it now (batch creating content on sundays helps a lot), the hourly rate is decent.\n\nthe hard parts nobody talks about:\n\nfirst, the guilt. there are real fitness influencers grinding every day, actually working out, filming themselves, and here I am with a fake person getting brand deals. I’ve made peace with it because the brands know what they’re getting (I’m transparent that its an AI persona when they ask directly) but it still feels weird sometimes.\n\nsecond, the technical learning curve. getting consistent faces, good lighting, realistic poses took forever to figure out. my first hundred images were unusable. hands still look weird sometimes and I have to regenerate a lot.\n\nthird, engagement farming. you still have to actually engage with followers, respond to DMs, comment on other accounts. the content creation might be automated but the community building isn’t. I probably spend more time on engagement than actual content creation.\n\nthings I wish I knew earlier:\n\npick a niche where the AI aesthetic actually works. fitness, fashion, travel photography all work well because people expect polished, professional looking images. something like “day in my life” content would be way harder to fake convincingly.\n\ndon’t cheap out on the tools. I wasted two months using free generators that produced obvious AI garbage. the paid tools cost money but the quality difference is massive.\n\ntreat it like a real business from day one. I set up a separate email, separate instagram account obviously, and track everything in a spreadsheet. revenue, costs, time spent, engagement rates. helps you figure out what’s actually working.\n\nthe future plan is to expand to tiktok with short form video content. some of the newer tools can do image to video stuff that looks pretty convincing. already tested a few clips and the engagement seems promising. if I can crack video content, the brand deal rates go up significantly.\n\nalso thinking about starting a second account in a different niche. maybe home decor or cooking. the playbook is pretty repeatable once you figure it out.\n\nthe monthly time investment now is probably around 12 to 15 hours total. sundays I batch create 20 to 30 images for the week, schedule them out, then just check in daily for engagement. compared to the 40 plus hours I was putting in at the beginning, it finally feels somewhat passive.\n\nstill have a decent emergency fund saved up from my day job so worst case if the account gets banned tomorrow I’m not ruined. but so far instagram hasn’t flagged anything and the follower growth has been steady at about 800 to 1000 new followers per month.\n\nthe whole experience taught me that passive income is never truly passive at the start. the first six months were basically a part time job that paid nothing. but now that the systems are in place and the account has momentum, the effort to income ratio finally makes sense.",

After 4 years of testing different side hustles, I’ve finally realized that the secret to success in 2026 is building high-value, low-friction digital products.\n\nSince I just had my first few sales on my breakdown today, I wanted to pass on 14 specific lessons I've learned to help you guys get a head start:\n\n1. **Solve \"Micro-Pain\" Points:** Don't solve a life problem; solve a 2-hour problem.\n2. **Prioritize Clarity over Length:** A 10-page guide that works is better than a 100-page book that is confusing.\n3. **The \"Coffee\" Price Point:** Selling for a low price is the \"sweet spot\" for impulse buys and building trust quickly.\n4. **Validation First:** Don't spend a month building. Spend 48 hours on a \"Version 1\" to see if anyone wants it.\n5. **Use \"Social Proof\":** Once you get your first sale, tell people! It shows your product is real and working.\n6. **Focus on Workflows:** Passive income isn't a \"set it and forget it\" magic trick; it's a repeatable system.\n7. **Organize your \"Digital Office\":** Separate your brainstorming time from your execution time to avoid burnout.\n8. **Build for 2026:** People want fast, actionable roadmaps, not long-winded theory.\n9. **Be Transparent:** If you use tools like AI to help you, be honest about it. Authenticity is a superpower on Reddit.\n10. **Community is King:** Provide 10x more value in comments than you do in your sales pitch.\n11. **The \"Loop\" over the \"Launch\":** Don't just launch and stop. Every customer question is a clue for your next update. Improving your product based on real feedback is what creates long-term passive income.\n12. **Own Your Traffic:** Don't just rely on one platform. Use social media to drive people to a simple landing page or email list. This way, you aren't at the mercy of an algorithm change.\n13. **Compound Your Assets:** One guide is a side hustle; five guides are a business. Once you find a workflow that works, repeat it for different \"Micro-Pain\" points in the same niche.\n14. **Focus on \"Evergreen\" Value:** Trends die fast. Solve a problem that people will still have 12 months from now. That is the difference between a quick buck and a steady income stream.\n\n**I've pinned the full 11-page breakdown on my Reddit profile for anyone who wants the deep dive (I put it there to keep this feed clean!).** I’m happy to chat in the comments if you have questions!\n\n**Note on this post:** I used AI to help me structure and write this post so that it is easy to read and the information is presented clearly for everyone.\n\n*(Disclaimer: The link on my profile leads to my personal digital product for beginners).*",

Most people make it sound like if you’re not rich by 25 you’ve failed, but that’s just not real life.\n\nOP, the average business owner actually starts around 40. Social media loves pushing the young rich outliers because it gets clicks, not because it’s normal. You genuinely have time. The good thing is you’re aware of it and you’re trying to change things. That already puts you ahead.\n\nIf I had one suggestion, it would be to put as much time as possible into learning. But not learning what you think you should learn. Learn what actually energizes you. That matters more than people admit. I found a bunch of resources along the way too, like this newsletter https://wealthrewired.beehiiv.com which helped me reframe how I thought about growth and time.\n\nAt one point I literally gave myself a learning budget. I let myself spend money on books, newsletters, courses, whatever helped me move forward. Amazon books, trends.co which was about $300 a year, theadvault.co.uk which is free. I didn’t care what the format was, I just needed momentum.\n\nFor context, my first job after college was in music after I ran out of money as a music producer and had to pivot. I was making about $35k a year in LA which was nowhere near enough to live. While working there I started experimenting with online businesses on the side. After some trial and error I had a couple small wins, then my company found out and didn’t like me building things on the side. I went back to work, hid my projects honestly, but kept going because I enjoyed it. Eventually I got good enough at coding to leave for a job I liked more, paid me double, and let me keep building side projects.\n\nI’ve felt lost more times than I can count. That feeling doesn’t mean you’re failing. Use it as fuel, keep learning, and stay focused on what actually pulls you forward.",

      "selftext": "I've been building an AI media tool on the side, and I almost had to shut it down last month because our Replicate bill was eating 70% of our revenue. When you're running a side hustle, you can't afford variable per-second billing that spikes every time a user runs a complex prompt.\nWe spent the weekend migrating to Hypereal AI as a replicate cheaper alternative. \n\nThe main reason we switched was their credit system ($10 for 1k credits). It’s so much easier to calculate your \"profit per user\" when you know exactly what a generation costs, rather than guessing based on milliseconds of GPU time.\nIt’s been a solid replicate cheaper alternative so far no monthly \"vampire\" fees, and the API handles Flux and video models without the cold start lag we were getting before. If you're struggling to make your AI side hustle profitable, I'd highly recommend looking into a credit-based infra provider. It literally saved our margins.",

      "selftext": "So this might sound weird, but hear me out.\n\nYou know how everyone's always looking for that perfect passive income stream? Well, I think Roblox development might actually be it.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* 350M+ users, mostly kids with disposable Robux (their currency)\n* One-click purchases built into the platform\n* Games can generate revenue 24/7 once published\n* Low barrier to entry with AI coding tools now\n\nI started experimenting with [Rebirth](https://userebirth.com/), an AI tool that helps you code Roblox games. It automatically tests and debugs, so you don't need to be a programming wizard.\n\nThe crazy part? A simple game called \"Escape Tsunami For Brainrots!\" has 350K concurrent players. It looks super basic but kids LOVE it.\n\nOnce your game is up, it runs itself. Kids buy in-game items, game passes, and premium features with their allowance money (Robux). You cash out through Roblox's DevEx program. Blowing up as well is just ONE tiktok video.\n\nNot saying it's \"get rich quick\" but compared to other passive income ideas I've tried (dropshipping, print-on-demand, etc.), this actually has real earning potential with an audience that's EAGER to spend. \n\nHas anyone else tried this? What's been your experience? ",

Unsubscribe and hit the three dots and select Don't Recommend Channel. Do not watch them. They're liars. Period.    \n    \nSecond, pick a thing and commit to it for *at least* a year. Anything you pick, you need to tell yourself \"Ok, I'm going to do this for a full year.\" I've certainly fallen into the \"it didn't work in the first couple weeks\" trap, and the problem with that usually is that you don't set a duration.      \n   \nIt's always    \n\"I'm going to to this and see what happens.\"   \nand not   \n\"I'm going to do this for a year and see what happens.\"   \n    \nMaking that mindset shift where you know how long you're in for is a huge help. Being 2 weeks in with no progress feels bad. Being 2 weeks in with no progress when you know you're committed to 52 weeks isn't a big deal because duh, you're just starting. Of course you're not seeing progress yet, and that's ok. You're going to keep going because you've barely scratched the surface.   \n    \nHonestly, if you cannot commit to doing one thing for a full year, don't even waste your time starting.",

          "body": "So many different options :) just try different ones and see if any get traction. What about offering a service in your town? I used to mow lawns on Saturday mornings and it was paying my mortgage every month. I set up a [Google business profile](https://business.google.com/en-all/business-profile/) in my town and that is where I received all of my leads. The Google business profile is cool because it’s free and if you work on getting good reviews you’ll probably out rank your competitors. People locally constantly turn to Google when they need a service. Something you could do is graphic design that specializes in logos and use ChatGPT, grok or Gemini to design them for you. You can get leads by making a google business profile for that as well and set up the primary category as “graphic designer”. Make sure you fill out the google business profile fully, so add photos, website, etc. If you’re worried that you don’t know how to build a website then use something like [Carrd](https://carrd.com), which is super easy to use and very cheap. Also, I read in newsletter [side hustle builders](https://open.substack.com/pub/sidehustlebuilders) that if you have a local garage sale/business facebook group for your town you could get leads that way too just by networking.

The barrier of entry is so low, which means insane competition.\n\nBut on the other side of this, there’s now insane demand for monetization experts who know how to turn views into money without leaving a lot on the table.\n\nIn my opinion, learning to build funnels puts you in a golden spot in this influencer era. Finding clients is easy. I’ve had to raise my prices to the point where I won’t even consider anything under $10k/month base fee + commission.\n\nAnd you don’t have to work only with influencers. I built a funnel for a California construction company that sells Chinese backyard rental houses (unit price \\~$300k), and now they’re selling around 5 units per month. My 5% commission on that is not bad.\n\nI guess ask me anything. Just wanted to throw this idea out here for those still starting out and standing at a road fork of choosing a business model.",

High-ticket stuff like your $300k units, B2B SaaS, or done-for-you agencies can all afford $10k/month + performance if you can prove ROAS in 60–90 days.\n\n\n\nIf someone wants to follow a similar path, I’d focus on: 1) one traffic source (YouTube ads, TikTok ads, or SEO), 2) one funnel type (lead gen → sales call or webinar → call), and 3) one niche where you can stack 3–5 case studies fast.\n\n\n\nTools-wise, I’ve bounced between GoHighLevel for the plumbing and ConvertKit/Klaviyo for email, plus Pulse for Reddit to mine real objections and language from niche subreddits so the funnel copy hits harder.\n\n\n\nMain point: specialize in turning attention into revenue and you’ll never struggle to find work.",

      "selftext": "I’ve had a few people ask me lately what I’m actually doing for work since I’ve been home more, so I figured I’d share a bit about my experience with Alignerr.\n\n\nI’ve been working as an AI Annotator for a while now, and it’s honestly been a relief to find something remote that’s actually legit. \n\nThe biggest misconception I hear is that you need to be a coder or a tech genius to do this.\n\n\nThe reality? I don’t touch a single line of code.\n\n\nI’m basically a human \"editor\" for AI. I read through responses it generates and help refine them so they’re more accurate and conversational. \n\nIf you have a good handle on language and a sharp eye for detail, that’s really all the \"technical\" skill you need. They didn’t require any prior AI experience to get started, which was the big selling point for me.\n\n\nA few things I’ve appreciated so far:\n\n\n**Real Flexibility:** I log on when it fits my schedule. No one is hovering over my shoulder.\n\n**Low Barrier to Entry: **You just take a skills assessment in your strongest subject (like writing or general knowledge) to get started.\n\n\n**The Work Itself: **It’s actually kind of interesting to see how the \"brain\" of an AI develops based on the feedback you give it.\n\n\nIt’s been a great way to get into the tech space without having to go back to school for a CS degree. If you’re looking for something remote that’s flexible and straightforward, it’s definitely worth looking into.",

      "selftext": "**Disclaimer:** I build in the SEO SaaS space, so yes, I’m biased. But I’m also sharing this because I wasted months following bad advice and I see the same patterns here daily.\n\n  \n**TL;DR:** Low KD, random posts and backlinks didn’t move the needle. Topical focus + intent did.\n\n  \nI started exactly like most people here.  \nWatching YouTube, reading blogs, making spreadsheets of low KD keywords, thinking “if I just publish enough, it will work.”\n\nIt didn’t. Not for a long time.\n\nWhat actually happened:  \nI ranked for some keywords.  \nGot impressions.  \nEven got traffic.  \nAnd still… no meaningful results.\n\nThat’s when I realized a few uncomfortable things.\n\nFirst: **low KD doesn’t mean good keyword.**  \nSome of the easiest keywords I targeted were also the most useless. No buying intent, no urgency, no real problem behind them. On paper they looked great. In reality they were dead.\n\nSecond: **random content doesn’t build authority.**  \nI was writing about whatever keyword I found that day. One post about X, next about Y, next about Z. To me it felt like progress. To Google it probably looked like noise. Once I stopped and went deep on one topic instead of touching ten, things slowly started making more sense.\n\nThird: **backlinks didn’t save me.**  \nYes, links matter. But they didn’t fix weak content. They didn’t fix lack of structure. They didn’t magically make Google understand my site. Cleaning up internal links and covering subtopics properly helped more than most links I chased.\n\nFourth: **most AI content is painfully obvious.**  \nI tried it. It saves time, but it also produces very generic stuff unless you heavily guide it (yes, it is possible but needs really good knowledge). Google may index it, but it doesn’t seem to trust it. You still need real depth and specifics.\n\n  \nThe biggest shift for me was this:  \nI stopped asking “how many posts should I write”  \nand started asking “what is missing for someone trying to solve this problem?”\n\nWhen I used Search Console data instead of keyword tools, and built around what was already getting impressions, things became much clearer.\n\nIf you’re grinding and feel like SEO “isn’t working”, there’s a good chance you’re not bad at it, you’re just following advice that sounds good but doesn’t map to reality.\n\nI wish someone had told me this earlier. Posting so maybe it saves someone else a few months.",

Build them one using free AI tools. Connect it to Google Sheets so they can edit everything themselves. Charge $500-$1000 one-time.\n\n**Why it works:**\n\n* Google Sheet connection means clients aren't dependent on you for updates\n* Demo video showing them edit the sheet live = high close rates\n* Volume game: 50-100 outreach/day = 1-2 sales/day\n\n**Numbers people are seeing:**\n\n* $10k-$20k/month once dialed in\n* $0 startup cost\n* 30-45 minutes per site\n\n**Best for:** People who can do high volume outreach and follow a system\n\n# Side Hustle #2: Selling Problem-Solving PDFs\n\n**How it works:** Find a specific problem people complain about in niche communities. Create a PDF solution. Sell for $5-$15 in those same communities.\n\n**Example:** \"How to reduce your child's screen time in 30 days\" sold to stressed parents for $9.\n\n**Why it works:**\n\n* People pay for convenience vs Googling through 50 blog posts\n* Quick to create (3-5 hours)\n* Low price point = easy impulse buy\n\n**Numbers people are seeing:**\n\n* $300-$500/month per PDF\n* $0 startup cost\n* Passive once created\n\n**Best for:** People with expertise in a specific area or good at research\n\n# Side Hustle #3: AI Voice Agents for Businesses\n\n**How it works:** Build AI voice assistants for appointment booking, customer service, lead qualification. Sell to businesses for $300-$500 per agent.\n\n**Why it's harder:**\n\n* Lower response rates on cold outreach\n* More technical setup required\n* Harder to demonstrate value upfront\n\n**Numbers people are seeing:**\n\n* $3k-$5k total before pivoting to something else\n* Works, but harder to scale\n\n**Best for:** People with technical skills who want to experiment\n\n# What's Actually Easiest to Start?\n\n**Websites win for beginners:**\n\n* Fastest to first dollar\n* Easiest to scale (just volume)\n* Simple sales process (demo does the selling)\n\n**PDFs work if:** You have niche knowledge or can identify problems in communities you're part of\n\n**Voice agents:** Skip unless you're very technical and patient",

Who in the world wants to spend a dollar to save 35 cents. It makes sense if you were going to do it because it’s a necessary thing for your business to grow but it’s just an expense, of course it’s not going to count towards your taxable basis. Can someone explain if I’m just missing something.\n\nI’m in real estate depreciation is much different because it’s a passive loss and gets added back to income which makes you more bankable. So I can see why cost segs under 100% bonus depreciation is hyped but not “write off’s” in other businesses\n\nEdit: People are not realizing I am talking about the people who say “you can just write it off” about everything. I’m talking about the items that aren’t necessarily needed, or a new one is not needed but someone is wanting to decrease their tax bill. The math doesn’t make any sense. Any expense necessary for a business to improve of course should be deducted as an expense",

If you pull down millions a year the savings add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Do you need it? No you don’t. Do you want to keep it regardless of need? Absolutely. Why?

Now, 5 years later, I get hit with a huuuuge tax bill ($100k+) from a previous transaction (real estate). It's gonna wipe out a lot of my net worth, so I can't survive on SP500/BTC anymore as I did before. \n\nI now live in Mauritius (world-class surf/kitesurf spot) but I can't legally work here. Also, it's a shit market to work in. The population is 1.3M and people are poor. It's paradise leisurely but a nightmare economically. BYOM (Bring your own money). \n\nI'm only legally allowed to work in Canada or online. \n\nI need to pull income again and refill my net worth. \n\nNo idea where to start....\n\nDo I become a plumber? I basically need to restart my career...\n\nI can start my own business again but honestly don't know what field. I haven't been in Canada for 5 years and now I'm visiting. I feel lost.

They had the advantage of knowing both cultures and markets. So a few examples could be to marketing for travelling to where you’ve been, or even guided stuff where you live now. Or import unique or special goods from where you are to Canada (stuff that you think Canadians would pay for). So basically think about what a Canadian could use your local knowledge or contacts for, and try to capitalise on that. That sounds like your best advantage right now if you can’t stand going the normal route of just returning home and going to trade school. \n\nYou also have the story of your travel life and how you got there, surely that is worth reading about.\n\nGood luck mate!",

You can stay, and get as many shares as you can afford, and often you can leave to help a savvy competitor for a big raise or stay and become part of the top people in charge of a growing business.",

The pay alone is nothing crazy but it’s great benefits and steady pay to keep you afloat, and a schedule that accommodates working toward something else, all the while contributing something very real to your community.

You wonder if you’re building something or just losing time.\n\nI’m not quitting. Just being honest.\n\nIf you’re an entrepreneur, how do you deal with those low motivation phases ?",

          "body": "Andy Frisella has a power list system of doing just 5 things; action items each day. I started doing this in early 2017. My list usually is mostly business but some days there's family and personal items in that five.\n\nI write it down in a note book every night. Then, at the end of each day, I write win or loss. If you win enough days, you win the week. If you win enough weeks, you win the month. \n\nIt also gives me a journal of action items that I can go back and look at over the years. If I don't hit a quarterly goal or if a habit doesn't change in my personal life. I can take a look and see what I did each day in that time period.\n\nAnother aspect of building a business, they're people don't talk about is how easy it is to lie to ourselves. We try to make ourselves believe that busy is productive. Are you really moving the needle though? \n\nIt's the easiest form of discipline building i've ever implemented. Now there have been some dark nights of the soul so to speak throughout the last ten years. Where I don't wanna do anything. In those moments on those days I make myself get up and do something very uncomfortable.\n\nA couple weeks ago, we had a cold front come through Texas. Nothing major but colder than what we're used to. I live in a rural area, surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of acres. I think it said thirty five mile an hour winds that day but our wind gauge was hitting fifty plus. It was miserable outside.\n\nI'd made myself get up at 6:30 in the morning, because I usually sleep until I wake up naturally. I got dressed quickly, and I went out to the horses barn/shed. And got his bucket and I hiked back to the shop to fill it with feed and let it soak with warm water. I made myself stand outside in the cold wind for that ten minutes. Then, I hiked back out through multiple gates that I had to unlock and lock. Disengaging and reengaging electric fences. Gave the beast his bucket. When I hiked back through the gates and went inside. All in all, it took about thirty minutes.And I was cold.\n\nI jumped in a hot shower.Got dressed again for the day. Grabbed my backpack with my business stuff in it and I headed to my office. I didn't feel better but I was moving. I started into my list which I had purposely made very easy for the day. Knocked it out within about two hours. \n\nWhen you're done with your five things, you're done for the day. Myself included everyone always says, oh I can do twelve things or thirty things. Just do the fucking five things. \n\nI finished my five things and I went to sit on the couch in my office and just scroll the internet. Then, my phone rang with a new customer. Then, another, and another, and another, and another. Turns out, one of our competitors was bought out, and the new company's prices went up another thirty percent. I have no employees.I handle everything for my company and it's quite large. When a new customer contacts us, though I have to do all the onboarding, enter their order set up the financials and the emails and then pick their order pack their order and ship their order all before three p m.\n\nI was not in the mood or the mind state.To do this shit. I was done for the day. \n\nNow i've switched into a different phase, which is called test days.... Another Andy Frisella process. This is where your discipline kicks in. I knocked out all the orders on time.And then I went back to the office to tally up the financial. $17,356 in new sales in one day. That was a record.My previous record was $13k. Each one of these customers will re order every single month forever. I had just had the best day. I'd had in business in a long time and it was one of the worst days for me mentally.\n\nIf I had not of woken up early and done the horse feeding  before forcing myself to the office to knock out my powerlist, it would have been too late in the day for me to accomplish all three things. \n\nThat leads me to another belief that I personally have, is that I have a path. I'm on my path and as long as I stay on my path, things will work out.\n\nThose test days are The Times that you look back on for brief encouragement when you need it to reinforce your discipline.\n\nKnow this though, when you become successful, even though you're still dealing with this type of shit, weekly, people are gonna tell you that you must have gotten lucky to be as successful as you are.",

Or wont be good enough. This makes you feel demotivated. and most people thing just getting through the work will fix it. But Action without alignment is just a distraction. \n\nTry  Visualizing having achieved your goal. and feeling those emotions. if you feel like your not fully convinced you will achieve it. set a small goal that you KNOW you can do and visualize having already DONE that. these small actions compound, Maintaining these emotions will create the reality you want ,you will intuitively see the actions you need to take to make it real.

It's not supposed to.\n\nWhat you're experiencing now is normal. It's the middle of the journey, where the excitement wears off and reality sets in. This is where most people quit. Not because they're not disciplined - because they're exhausted.\n\nThe \"just be disciplined\" advice is bullshit. You can't discipline your way out of building from the wrong place.\n\nHere's what helped me:\n\n**Stop asking \"am I motivated today?\"**\n\nStart asking \"why am I building this?\"\n\nIf the answer is external (prove something, hit metrics, look successful), you'll burn out. Because external goals keep moving. There's always another milestone.\n\nIf the answer is internal (this matters to me, this aligns with who I am, this serves something bigger), you'll find a different kind of fuel. Not motivation - purpose.\n\n**The mental side you mentioned?**\n\nThat doubt, that comparison, that \"am I wasting my time\" spiral - it's all coming from one place: you're building from pressure, not purpose.\n\nPressure to perform. Pressure to succeed. Pressure to prove you're not wasting your time.\n\nWhen you build from pressure, every low day feels like failure. Every slow week feels like proof you're not good enough.\n\nWhen you build from purpose, low days are just... days. Not evidence. Not identity.\n\n**Practically, what I did:**\n\n\\- Stopped checking metrics first thing (they controlled my mood)\n\n\\- Got clear on why THIS project, not just \"be successful\n\n\\- Set boundaries (work hours, offline time, non-negotiables\n\n\\- Found someone who'd been where I am, and five years ahead of me (coach, not just cheerleader)\n\nThe discipline people talk about? It's easier when you're building something that matters to you, not something you \"should\" be building.\n\nYou're not stuck because you lack motivation. You might be stuck because you haven't figured out if this is YOUR thing or someone else's idea of success. It's a lonely journey and sometimes you might lack the accountability, guidance, structure that you might have had before. That's ok to have.\n\nNot quitting is good. But also - ask yourself, am I building the right thing? Or am I just stubborn?\n\nThose are different questions.\n\nI also echo u/FatherOften on the 5 priority list items that no matter what, you action on.\n\nGood luck.

          "body": "This is a great reality check, but i think we're missing a structural fix here.\n\nWe talk about the 'mental struggle' like it’s some ghost haunting us, when it’s actually a system error. Think of it like an **LLM**: if you don’t provide clear **constraints**, the output is just high-speed hallucinations and chaos. That’s exactly what we do to our brains.\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\n* **Strategy vs. Busywork:** Being submerged in tasks isn’t 'grinding'; it’s a one-way ticket to Burnout City. If your strategy doesn’t dictate a lean action plan, you’re just throwing spaghetti at the wall and wondering why the wall is messy.\n* **The 'Void' Factor:** For a first-timer, entrepreneurship is a literal leap into the void. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed. Give yourself actual time to **somatize** the shift. A total identity overhaul takes much longer than we’re willing to admit, and you can't rush the biological clock of adaptation.\n* **Neuroplasticity is your gym:** The 'mental side' isn't just something to 'endure.' You’re using neuroplasticity to hardwire the habits of the person you want to become. This takes time, repetition, and a lot of recalibration.\n\n**TL;DR:** Stop adding tasks and start add better constraints. Above all, be supportive to yourself, you deserve it, even if only for the massive step you took by starting this journey on the first place.\n\nHope this helps and good luck!",

Sharing honest takes, lessons learned, even mistakes in places like Reddit or smaller communities builds trust surprisingly fast.\n\nWe also stopped trying to make broad content. Generic blog posts didn’t move anything. Very narrow, very specific content for one clear ICP did.\n\nCold outbound still works too, but it’s way better when it’s not actually cold. If someone has seen your content or recognizes your name, replies go up a lot.\n\nOverall, what’s worked best is just showing up where our ICP already hangs out, talking about the problem, sharing what we’re seeing, and helping.

No fancy site.\n\n3) Early outreach was very manual He spent a lot of time personally replying to people who engaged but didn’t reach out.

      "selftext": "I’m going to share a story with you about how the company I work for actually started, before it was a proper SaaS.\n\nNot the founder, not the dev. I work close to product and growth at a SaaS that turns Google Maps into usable lead lists. Seeing the \"behind the scenes\" here has been a serious reality check.\n\nBefore there was an automated platform, the founders were coming off a failed project. They were burned out from building features that looked great on paper but didn't sell. So for this new idea, they made a simple rule: Don’t code. Just sell.\n\nFor the first few months, the product was just a manual service. They found people who needed local business data, and when someone asked for a list, they ran scripts manually on a laptop. They cleaned the Excel files by hand, line by line, and sent them via email with a simple PayPal invoice.\n\nIt sounds counter-intuitive for a tech company, but this manual grind is exactly what saved the business. If the data was wrong, the customer complained instantly. They didn't need to analyze user behavior to know what was broken, they felt it in the inbox. It also proved that people weren't paying for a slick tool, they were paying for the result. If a customer is willing to wait 24 hours for a manual email, you know you have a real business. Plus, those early sales literally funded the first months of actual development.\n\nThe automated dashboard was only built once the manual work became physically impossible to handle.\n\nThe lesson from inside the machine is clear: The SaaS was built to scale a solution that already worked, not to try and find a problem with a shiny UI. If what you’re doing right now feels ugly, slow, and unscalable, you’re probably exactly where you need to be.\n\n**🛡️ Authenticity verified:** this content is based on real-world data and real-world events involving real people.

          "body": "This is such a real post and honestly refreshing to read.\n\nThe \"don't code, just sell\" rule is harsh but it makes you face the only question that matters: will someone actually pay for this? Not would they maybe use it if it were free, but will they literally give you money.\n\nWhat gets me is how the manual process wasn't just validation, it was education. Every angry email about bad data, every question about what fields they needed, every \"can you also include...\" request. That's signal you just can't get from analytics or surveys. You're learning what the product needs to be because you're doing the work yourself, feeling every problem firsthand.\n\nThe timing thing is huge too: \"The automated dashboard was only built once the manual work became physically impossible to handle.\" Most founders do the opposite. They build the whole thing before knowing if anyone wants it. By the time you're drowning in manual work, you know exactly which parts to automate first because you're living the pain.\n\nThere's also something powerful about being willing to do unscalable things. It shows early customers you're serious, that this isn't just a side project that might disappear. Someone who will manually clean a spreadsheet at 11pm to get you your data actually cares about solving your problem.\n\nOne thing though: this works great for services where the value is immediate and tangible, like data or clear results. It's trickier for products where the value is in the tool itself or needs network effects. But even then, the core idea holds. Find the simplest way to deliver the value and see if anyone actually cares.",

          "body": "Interesting story, and a great lesson in focusing on real customer demand before over-engineering. I can imagine that initial manual grind felt quite demoralising at times, but it turned out to be the exact path your founders needed.\n\nYou're right that sometimes the \"ugly, slow, and unscalable\" stage is actually the most valuable. When you're so close to the problem, it's easy to feel like the solution has to be sleek and automated from the start. But those early manual workflows are often where you surface the true pain points and prove there's a market.\n\nIf this feels like the current phase for your product, I'd encourage you to lean into it. What specific aspects of the manual work are the most illuminating? Where do customers seem most engaged or frustrated? Observing those raw interactions can give you invaluable insights that may get lost once things are fully automated.\n\nJust remember to pace yourself. Avoid the temptation to over-optimise before the core foundation is solid. As long as you're learning and getting paid, the \"ugliness\" is a feature, not a bug. What's one small step you could take next to make that manual process just a little bit smoother?",

Healthcare costs are insane. Hiring is expensive. Everyone expects Silicon Valley salaries even if you're bootstrapped. Fundraising is a full-time job if you go that route.\n\nI think every location has trade-offs. The grass isn't always greener.\n\nWhat I've learned is you can't control your environment, you can only control how you adapt to it. If you're in a place with less infrastructure, build accordingly - remote team, async work, smaller scope. If you're in an expensive market, bootstrap longer or find early revenue.\n\nThe founders who succeed aren't necessarily in the \"best\" location. They're the ones who work with what they have instead of wishing for different constraints.",

Turns out that doing it that way I was able to go home immediately, but the corporation still paid me full salary for the next 2 months, and my final 2 weeks pay had my \"holiday money\", so it was tripple the normal pay. Never before been so happy for geting fired!!!\n\nWell, I already had my own shop and some tools, so I've been there, chain smoking, drinking coffee, and thinking, thinking and thinking. The 2 months just ended, and it looks like I now have a car repair shop. I was supposed to have a welding shop, but after 1 month of thinking I changed the plan because I realized that for cars I have all the tools I need, and it's easier to find customers.\n\nNow I'm a bit scared. Savings are burned, and GF is going to a surgery, and after that she's unable to work for 2 months.",

But from what I'm seeing, you're not the type to become an entrepreneur out of necessity. So you should keep an eye out for opportunities. It's likely that your choice will be in technology. Entrepreneurship is wonderful, but you have to follow a path full of strategies. And that's quite complicated, haha, because you don't always win. And when I say win, I'm not talking about competitors, because over time you realize that your competitors are actually your partners, haha. It's crazy. Because there are days when you'll only have \"water\" to survive and there are days when you'll have a \"banquet.\" The entrepreneur is always in the worst situation, because the objective is first and foremost their organization.\n\n\nNote: I am an entrepreneur in the technology sector and also a PhD in entrepreneurship. And do you know what the secret is? You must persevere. Change your product, but don't give up. However, if I were to tell you what I intend to specialize in from now on, it would be in manufacturing products and the financial market. Oh, and choose a partner who is resilient to loss. That's important. They also need to be strong enough to handle your yelling. Yes. A fragile partner won't do. Because when you don't have a psychologist, they need to have the vision of where you should go.",

If you’re still operating like it’s pre-raise, that alone can burn you out fast. The job changes, but a lot of us don’t change with it.\n\nAlso, the low social battery thing is real. Constant decision-making just empties the tank. That doesn’t mean something is wrong with you, it just means you’re running hot all the time.\n\nAnd honestly, burnout after “success” doesn’t get talked about enough.

I tried opening up a business with “partners” people who I didn’t know all that well and that was my first mistake.

Saying all of that I do recognise and appreciate that work did take precedence during the relationship and at times often did and I can relate to you on that front \n\nI’m integrating the understanding that the people who did truly support are still here and a friend made sense to me that “if she was truly supporting you she would have been a part of what you are doing not just being there ‘waiting’” for something to happen. \n\nWith your situation, you clearly show respect and appreciation for what your ex did with you and you needed to put that time in on your craft to get to where you were. Although you may not be able to enjoy the fruits with him, you owe it to yourself for the hard work you put in and the dreams and ambitions were yours.

It's not just about the bold moment of launching - it's about the daily courage to:\n\n* Make decisions with incomplete information\n* Pivot when your original vision isn't working\n* Have difficult conversations with co-founders, employees, or investors\n* Keep pushing through the \"messy middle\" when the excitement fades but success hasn't arrived yet\n* Stay authentic to your mission even when shortcuts seem tempting\n\nThe entrepreneurs who make it aren't necessarily the ones with the perfect idea or the most funding - they're the ones who have the courage to adapt, learn from failure, and maintain conviction in their vision even when others doubt them. We've seen this firsthand in the MENA startup ecosystem.",

Few business owners realize also that bookkeeping provides more than just the accounting, it provides good timely information to better manage your business.

Just pick any business that already exists, and do it slightly better,  show up on time,  offer good service,  be consistent.   That's really all it takes to run a good business.   You don't need to re-invent the wheel.  Think garbage removal,  window cleaning, roofing company, landscaping, moving company etc.\n\nDon't buy an existing business or take on a huge loan.  You find something that you can start out small at.  Ideally something you don't need to to to school for like learning a trade (pumber, electrician).  Let's say garbage removal.   You start by working a traditional job,  getting your expenses really lean and saving up enough money to buy a big, cheap pickup truck.   You register a business, make a website, learn everything you can online from YouTube,  reddit,  books from the library about garbage removal and starting a small business.   You start social media accounts, hire a friend or someone on fiver to make you a logo.   You post ads on kijiji, craigslist, Facebook marketplace.   You get your first few jobs and get paid cash.   They leave you a good review.   You find a local business center that offers grants to small businesses and offers free classes and resources for local entrepreneurs.  You get a few more jobs.  You learn about how collecting and paying sales tax works and you get setup with quickbooks.  You design and print up door knockers and leave them on 1000 doors.  You try more sales and marketing things.   You get more work.   Eventually,  you have enough jobs that you can finance a big truck with a bin that you leave in their driveway.  You get bigger invoices.  Eventually you quit your full time job.   You keep working hard and growing.   You get so busy that you need to hire your first employee.  You get a 2nd truck etc etc etc.\n\nI studied business in school but it really doesn't translate to actually starting your own business.   You mostly learn by doing the thing. \n\nI am a self employed real estate photographer and i also run an online community for photographers to learn and grow.   All in,  i earn low 6 figures.  If i wanted to put the effort in,  i could do more sales, hire employees,  and build a small real estate media agency. \n\nYou just gotta start and take it one step at a time.",

      "selftext": "\n\nAfter my business story hit 289K views on Reddit last week, I got flooded with DMs asking for specifics on how I built and sold my contracting business. So here’s the real breakdown.\n\n**The starting point (1994):**\n\n- $3,200 in capital\n- Zero industry connections\n- Just me, a truck, and tools\n- HVAC experience but no business experience\n\n**The exit (2018):**\n\n- 24 years later\n- Debt-free sale\n- Built entirely on retained earnings (never took outside funding)\n- Left with systems that could run without me\n\n**What actually moved the needle:**\n\n**1. Competed on value, never on price**\n\nThis was non-negotiable from day one. When customers called around for quotes, I wasn’t trying to be the cheapest - I was trying to be the obvious choice. My pitch focused on what they’d get: reliability, quality work, someone who’d still be around in 10 years.\n\nThe “pacemaker close” became my signature move: “If your heart needed fixing, would you want the cheapest surgeon or the best one?” Changed the entire conversation.\n\n**2. Built trust before asking for money**\n\nFree small repairs under $100. Sounds crazy, but it was the best marketing I ever did. Customer calls about a minor issue? Fix it for free. No invoice, no sales pitch.\n\nThey’d tell everyone. I got more business from those $50 giveaways than from thousands spent on traditional advertising.\n\n**3. Offered a 10-year labor guarantee**\n\nNobody else was doing this. Most guys offered 1-2 years max. I went 10 years on labor because I knew my work would last. It eliminated price objections instantly and proved I wasn’t going anywhere.\n\n**4. Tracked everything religiously**\n\nI knew my numbers cold - cost per lead, conversion rates, customer lifetime value, profit margins by job type. Most contractors fly blind. I treated it like a business, not just a trade.\n\n**5. Hired slowly, fired fast**\n\nCulture matters in a small company. One toxic tech can destroy years of reputation building. I learned this the hard way twice before getting it right.\n\n**What didn’t matter as much as I thought:**\n\n- Fancy marketing\n- Being the biggest shop in town\n- Having the newest equipment\n- Competing with the big guys on their terms\n\n**The real secret:**\nThere isn’t one. It’s showing up, doing what you say you’ll do, treating people right, and not quitting when it gets hard. Boring stuff that works.\n\nI documented everything I learned into a blueprint because too many good contractors fail for business reasons, not technical ones. But that’s not why I’m posting - I just figured some of you might find the journey useful.\n\nHappy to answer questions.\n",

HVAC installs, emergency repairs, and maintenance calls shouldn’t be treated as one funnel.

Align your project/work with who you truly are. and who you want to become and every tasks will GIVE you energy instead, making it 100x easier to switch off when needed. Also, you probably set the bar too high for now, hence that constant feeling you should be doing more.

          "body": "From psychology the answer would be to have a solid, non negotiable end routine.\n\nWrite down what you have completed in the session and what's to be done next session. Clean your desk/take care of everything that still needs to be taken care off, etc. And when you are truly finished finished, give your body some form of signal. Maybe clapping your hands twice or slapping yourself in the face, whatever you choose do it everytime so that your body connects it to \"work done\".\n\nOnce you did it, truly let the work be. Don't do something little more, don't start planning something for your work, don't try to reaearch something or read a book for your work. Teach your body and mind that once work is done, it truly is done for the day.\n\nSo, the practical conclusion: You want to switch your nervous system from performance to relax mode. If the End routine isn't enough for you, you can hook in here and just try a new thing every week. Maybe medidating and breathing. Maybe taking a hot shower or bath. Maybe you first want to go for a walk, write your thoughts down and then declare the work done for today. However the details you are working out will look like, it's important that you take it seriously.\n\nYou can only spend as much energy as you regenerate. Not wasting energy, but also filling it up to the limit everyday, is the key to consistently work hard without burning out, without going into depression and without losing focus.\n\nOne last tipp, if you can afford it under your circumstances, don't ever use an alarm to wake up. Go to bed when you are tired and stay up once you wake up naturally. Easiest way to ensure your body actually had as much sleep time as it needed.",

      "selftext": "I run a small coffee shop and had this one barista who everyone loved. Customers asked for her by name, she knew everyones orders, super bubbly personality. I thought she was irreplaceable honestly.\n\nBut I started noticing our numbers were off. Not hugely but enough that I was losing sleep over it. Inventory didnt match sales, we were going through way more supplies than we should for our ticket averages. I initially blamed it on waste or bad tracking on my end.\n\nLong story short, caught her on camera giving free drinks to friends and taking cash sales without ringing them up. When I confronted her she got defensive and said \"everyone does this at coffee shops\" and that I should be grateful she brought in so many regulars. I had to let her go.\n\nHere's the crazy part. I was terrified wed lose customers. But ever since she left our sales have actually been up. Not just a little better but like consistently better numbers. I think she was pocketing way more than I even realized and her \"regulars\" were probably just people getting free stuff.\n\nMy other employees seemed relieved too which was unexpected. Apparently shed been creating drama and making their shifts miserable but I was so focused on the customer facing stuff I didnt see it.\n\nLesson learned I guess, sometimes the person who seems the most valuable is actually costing you the most. Both in actual money (glad I had some saved up from Stаke for situations like this) and in team morale.",

He got praised for more sales. But it was selling things for under the stated price\n\n\nIt was awful because when he wasn't on shift, you got his customers asking for their discounts and of course we looked like the idiots because we had no idea the extent of this. And sone customers were terrible people who would give you sob stories and not let it go and be jerks about it.\n\n\nThe solution? Truly be a manager. Be present in the store, working with the employees. Serve the customers during employee breaks. Do inventory regularly, look at the stock, etc. Then you will see exactly what is going on. ",

Because those employees feel like they “deserve” more than the business is giving them.

          "body": "&gt;My other employees seemed relieved too which was unexpected. Apparently shed been creating drama and making their shifts miserable but I was so focused on the customer facing stuff I didnt see it.\n\nThe pocketing cash part is clearly theft, but the rest sounds more like custom &amp; culture. For example, I've never worked in a restaurant where we didn't get free pop &amp; a shift meal. That was never tracked and I'm sure a shift meal went out some someone's friends now &amp; again, but the owner kept a hawk's eye for abuse of the privilege.\n\nWe don't really do annual reviews like a lot of larger places do, but we do have regular cost of living increases for staff. When I sit them down to discuss that, at the very end I ask if they have any comments/concerns/complaints/frustrations/pain points/whatever with their job or the business, in general. I make it clear that there's no discipline on this and that their answer has no bearing on the raise we just discussed. I want real candid thoughts.\n\nThe point is, I can't trust people to come forward with some of that themselves, for fear they'll rock the boat too much. This gives them a chance to express their thoughts in the grey areas, where it's more opinion or custom than actual rule breaking or illegality. \n\nBecause I want to find out things like what you just described before it becomes a problem.",

I’d roll a truck, fix it, no charge. Cost me maybe $40 in labor, but that customer:\n\t∙\tNever shopped around again\n\t∙\tSent me 3-4 referrals minimum\n\t∙\tCalled ME first for their next $8K system replacement\nMy competitors were still fighting over $50 price differences while I was locking in customers for life.\nThe result over 24 years:\n\t∙\tBuilt a debt-free company (never took a loan after startup)\n\t∙\tSold customers only what they actually needed (shocker, I know)\n\t∙\tExited clean with equity, not a pile of owed money\nMost contractors think the only way to win is being the cheapest quote.\nI proved you can win by being the contractor they trust most.\nPrice is what you pay.

It ALL started from me calling them randomly when my office air went out at 1PM on a hot July day. I called after seeing their reviews and the dispatch said they wouldn't be able to get out to me for another 24 hours. Anyway I go to leave around 6pm I hear some banging on the wall and two of their guys are out there. I said \"I thought you weren't coming until tomorrow!\" Their answer \"Well we were on our way home and was passing your office anyway we figured we might as well take a look\" I was locked in from that day. They were my HVAC guys from here on.\n\nMany years down the road I buy a house and the AC went down and they came out and said I needed a 3 ton (3100 sq ft) furnace and AC unit (I knew it was time). I asked them on three different discussions \"Are you SURE I don't need a 5 ton?\" I was told no over and over. Well, the day came and two service techs showed up went to work and I asked them \"You guys sure I don't need a 5 ton?\" at this point they're installing the furnace. Suddenly they come down and call me over. \"Well.....you need a 5 ton\" I laughed and said \"See!\" they said \"Well we gotta go get the 5 ton units and take the furnace back out so we will be here longer.\" I asked what kinda pizza they liked.\n\nSo they go to leave and I say \"So whats it going to cost me now?\" he looked at me and said \"Nothing! This is on us\". I will never use another HVAC company and use them for my commercial property. They always come out quick and are honest. So yes once you do right by a solid customer they will  call you every time. To date I have probably paid out $13k to them over the years and there is NO ONE else I will call going forward.\n\nI will NEVER leave them and I will tell you something else watching them has enforced my standards at my own business. We can always do better and learn. I know how they made me feel so I want to do that for my clients as well. You're doing it the right way, don't ever stop doing it the right way because  there's not many of us out there doing it the right way.",

We've been in business for 18 years and I have processed a good many state-mandated wage garnishments for child support so I am well acquainted with the process.\n\n  \nThis week I was served papers by a process server for a Continuing Writ of Garnishment against one of my employees.  This is not child support related but rather a debt owed to a bank for about $3,500.00.  The papers were served by a law firm and have been filed with our local court.  These read very differently from the regular child-support garnishments I am used to.  This garnishment letter states that my failure to execute all documents and as well as begin garnishing wages in a timely manner could result in the full debt obligation being charged to us (our company).  \n\nI am directed to fill out the paperwork enclosed, expedite return to the law firm and file a copy with our local clerk of court within 20 days of receipt.\n\nAnd the fee I can charge for all the work - $17.  State of Florida allows a $5 admin fee for the first payroll garnishment and $2 each payroll after.  I have to pay for the expedited return shipping of docs to the law firm.  I have to pay for the filing fee with the clerk of court.  And $17 does not begin to cover the amount of administrative time that will be applied to this endeavor.\n\nIt absolutely BOGGLES my mind that I am expected to bear the costs for this person's inability to pay their bills or handle their personal finances.  Not only that but if I fail to respond/take action quickly, I could be responsible for HIS debt!!!  \n\nI am upset and outraged.  I have enough expenses and worries being a small business owner.  Now I have to also handle/solve the debt issues of those I hire??  Insane.",

We send the letter to our legal counsel and ask what we have to do, what our obligations are, etc. The lawyer sends back his draft of a response letter with the legalese version of telling them to politely fuck off. Our lawyer advises us that we don't do business in the same states so they have no standing.

I worked there through the housing market collapse of 2008. I saw first hand how predatory banks would get. Charging people $35 overdraft fees per transaction regardless of the amount of the transaction. There was a cap of five overdraft fees a day before the collapse. They raised it to ten overdraft fees max per day during the crisis. So I had to justify these fees to customers by saying ‘well we paid for the item’ or ‘you didn’t manage your account and so it cost us money to receive and reverse this charge so here’s a fee for each’. All while many people just had less than a hundred dollars of charges that brought them negative - then getting $350 of fees per day, plus fees for the account staying negative. \nAll it takes is a mortgage payment, a hospital bill that was paid, to get so negative, then a mountain of fees for the ‘burden’ of having this negative account on the books and you’re done. Maybe you don’t pay it as a protest or whatever. But then they’ve got the money and resources on their side to pursue - as they’re doing now. It’s not child support. They got got by a for profit institution. \n\nNo matter how this person got here.

In practice, if you fill out the form correctly, submit it on time, and follow the process, you don't end up being responsible for the debt. The system is designed to force you to cooperate, not to transfer the obligation to you… even if the wording is awful.\n\nI completely agree that the administrative fee is absurd and doesn't reflect the actual time or costs (especially postage and filing). Unfortunately, the state views it as a \"civic duty\" of the employer, not as a service you provide voluntarily.\n\n\nIf you don't already, it's usually worthwhile to have a standard internal procedure (checklist + templates) for these situations. This reduces the administrative burden and stress when they arise. It shouldn't be necessary, but it helps protect you.\n\n\nIn short: your frustration is valid; the system is clumsy with small businesses.

She had a stall at her school’s end-of-term event and asked me to help her with sales. My son came along to help and, for the first time, saw a small amount of money turn into a pile of cash as we sold out in two hours. He was fascinated by how money is made.\n\nWhat happened next:\nA week later, he asked me for a drone. I told him I wouldn't buy it for him. After he realized I wasn’t going to budge, he asked if he could start a business to earn the money himself, inspired by the day at the cupcake stall.\nHe convinced my sister to teach him how to make chocolates. He invested ₹300 of his own pocket money into molds and chocolate compound. He and his cousin made 100 chocolates and, before we even woke up the next morning, they had sold them all for ₹5 each, making ₹500. They have since bought more supplies and sold even more.\n\nThe advice I need:\nWhile I am very happy and proud of what he has achieved, I’m honestly not sure how to handle this.\n-Should I fully support this and let him continue?\n-Should I be setting specific rules for him?\n-How do I manage a child of this age starting a \"business\" venture?\n-Any other advice you might have for me?\nI’m looking for perspectives on the best way to guide him through this.",

I’m not sure where you are and what is needed / what’s the threshold. But, for now, just encourage him. He’s on to something - don’t manage him. Don’t do it for him. Just let him work it out while being supportive and sharing how happy you are that he’s found a way to earn his own money.\n\nEdit: and for what it’s worth, in some (most?) parts of the US, there is no minimum age to have a business license, or a parent can co-sign with the child. He’s not there yet, but fyi.",

Curiosity, initiative, delayed gratification, and seeing effort turn into results. You don’t need to shut it down, but you also don’t want it to turn into pressure or a grind.\n\nI’d support it, but with guardrails. Keep it clearly framed as a learning project, not a responsibility or expectation. Let him run it when he wants, pause when he’s bored, and stop entirely if it stops being fun.\n\nSetting simple rules helps. Things like fixed hours, adult supervision for money and food safety, and a clear split between saving, spending, and reinvesting. This keeps it educational instead of chaotic.\n\nUse it as a teaching tool. Talk through basic ideas like costs, profit, and why he doesn’t get to keep every rupee as “free money.” You can even introduce a rule where part of the profit goes toward the drone, part goes into savings, and part is for fun or sharing.\n\nMost importantly, protect his childhood. Don’t scale it, don’t optimize it, don’t turn him into a mini entrepreneur. The real win here isn’t the drone, it’s that he learned he can create something, take initiative, and follow through. If you keep it light and supportive, that lesson will stick far longer than the money ever will.",

Nothing bad will come of it, but he can pick himself up and jump on the next fascination if all goes downhill (hoping for his explosive success, but life does happen). If he comes to you with a problem offer to help, make sure he knows he has you as a parachute, and by all means give insights and support, but truly encourage him to make his own decisions and make or break things. It'll be a hard at times, and he'll inevitably want to do things differently than you would, but the mindset he's building now will carry him so so far. I honestly believe that being comfortable with the idea of \"I might fail and that's okay\" is the biggest lesson that's learned too late by most, and he's in such a privileged spot to learn it early. I promise you this won't be his last attempt at this either, just keep fostering that idea that it's possible to enjoy the bads just as much as the goods\n\nHonestly, I'd see this more of a character and bond building exercise for both of you than anything. Genuinely congrats to you, your kid, and your sister. It's clear he has fantastic and supportive role models from your post,",

I am in the trades and have been for a while but over time moved up to more of a managerial position and learned the business side and loved it. My passion for this spawned a small side business that is essentially a handyman style ordeal and I have 2 guys that work as needed for me and I keep them fairly busy, they are paid by job not hourly and older gentleman. One day we had a customer ask if we could fix up her dog house, it was trashed and falling apart so we rebuilt it. My oldest son and I knocked it out pretty quick for building portion then he and my younger son painted it and all the small details. Naturally I paid them for their work and my God did it light a fire.\n\nTyler(oldest) Mav(younger) came to me about a week later and asked to borrow some paper and pencils to draw up some stuff. Low and behold this little entrepreneur has come up with a full blown business building dog houses and play houses and made a whole layout of plans for about 6 different setups ( they were highly crude and made no sense on layout but hey it was a start!) They showed it to me with biggest smile and said they wanted to do a business building these for folks and called it 'Sweet T and Lil Mav's Construction'  it was a cool little run, didnt last long unfortunately they petered out quick, but it was ridiculously fun while it lasted. My oldest still occasionally does little stuff like that but the younger one is much more introverted and lost interest fast. \n\nAnyways ultimately I say let that man cook and conquer the market !",

We also boast a 4.8 on google reviews so I’m pretty proud of what my mom has built. Recently a women made a post on a local facebook group with about 26,000 members slamming our store, saying we are rude, didn’t take her clothes, etc. While we do love constructive criticism this post was full of lies and complaints that are all adressed in the contract are make every consigner sign before bringing anything in. The post blew up with tons of angry people complaining about how we were to picky and didn’t take there clothes. If anyone has been in the consignment business you would know how picky you have to be bc space is limited and extremely valuable. Anyways she denied signing any contract in her post which was completely false as we physically have a copy of her contract with the signature dating all the way back to 2014. On top of this she used credit on account multiple times meaning she knew she had an account in order to use the money in it. My question is how to handle the situation. Publicly out the woman with evidence of the lying or let it brush over. ",

I once took a used mattress on consignment that turned out to have a big stain on it after I unwrapped it for a buyer (he still decided to buy it, although I significantly discounted it for him at that point 🤢)\n\nOver the years, I grew more selective as a business because I had to. Most people could care less if you waste your own time and money trying to sell stuff that they just want to recoup some money from, but it obviously matters to you a lot more than them. I explain to people that don’t understand why I won’t take everything that I make the same amount of money selling ten $10 items as I do a single $100 item (and one requires 10x the amount of effort, literally). \n\nI’d assume this is the same way with selling clothes. You know your market best and can only fit so much in your store, so you have to pick items that your buyers are willing to purchase from your consignors, as you really have two different customers as a consignment business. \n\nAnyhow, I hope this may help you / others understand why good consignment businesses are so selective. It really comes down to supply (of things that people want to sell… which is overwhelming at times) vs demand (of things that people are willing to buy secondhand for good prices, which constantly changes). \n\nGood luck OP!",

If this lady has already demonstrated an oddly targeted vendetta toward your mother’s store, I’m not sure a “politically / delicately correcting the record” post will quash things. \n\n In my opinion, I think this may require a 1-2-punch. By this, I mean that you start with a post that doesn’t engage her head on and is educational in nature as many other comments here describe. Examples have included how the store &amp; its contracts operate but doesnt get into a game of dispute &amp; debate the Karen’s allegations. \n\nPart two is having your finger on the trigger for a corporate litigation attorney. I know it sounds intense but you said it yourself, this person has a following and it’s stirred others to voice other negative opinions too. You mentioned that you have a signed contract from a decade ago, I’m curious if there is any type of dispute resolution clause within it. If it doesn’t have one, you may consider sending a cease and desist directly to her since one may be able to argue that she is guilty of libel. It’s not even puffery, you guys have years of data to know what sale should look like so if there is a hit to revenue, you could try to draw a connection to her for damages. \n\nBefore you do any of this, weigh the options and use your best judgment of the situation to determine if it’s worth going this route. Sometimes, the quickest way to resolving bs like this is by demonstrating you won’t put up with it. This isn’t make-believe Tik Toks, this is your mother’s legacy (that happens to be a cash flowing business) and that needs to be protected. \n\nAlso, look this person up in the public criminal records (city, county, state) and local civil record to see who they rally areas. I’ve sometimes seen that getting into tiffs with local businesses is something that people make a career off… just being a professional complainer. It’s sad but true lol. \n\nIf you have an attorney or have the money to hire one (a nasty letter and some research should likely be a few grand for this situation) then you may want to consider it. \n\nAnother more tactical approach  is to have a one on one conversation with her where you can catch her off guard (and likely not recording the conversation) and just hear her out. I’ve noticed over the years that these people are angry about something in their life and more lonely than anything else. If you’re just someone who hears them out and makes them feel seen, a lot of times they will calm down after they get it all out. \n\nBest of luck.",

You shouldn't be using a pre-mixed bottle of cleaner, you should be buying in concentrate and mixing it with water.

About 2 months in she said she wanted out so with the support of my husband, I bought her out.\n\nOver the past year I have grown the business significantly and again with the support of my lovely husband, we are now in a position to scale.\n\nNow enter my sister who is saying it is not fair because she put in a lot of work initially and gave me the encouragement to start in the first place. She should receive come further compensation and would like me to pay her £5000 one off or £500 monthly.\n\nWhat should i do?  If this was a friend I would burn bridges but this is my younger sister!!I am thinking I don’t want to be taken advantage of because of my good nature but also don’t want to lose my sister. My family and parents think I am being selfish and should compensate her. My husband is 50/50 as deep down I know he thinks if he tells me to tell her to get fucked, I will resent him or something.\n\nPlease give me your unfiltered advice. How should i play this?!\n\nUpdate: TY everyone for your replies. She took at job 2 months in as she needed a stable income. We were making very little in the beginning. I bought her out for £37,000 and we had both initial put in £17000. legally I don’t owe her anything and everything was done properly. i feel like such an idiot but at the end of the day she is still my little sister so my emotions are all over the place with this one. I can afford to pay her but feel like the way she is going about it is just so wrong. If she asked me for money I would happily give it to her but why come at it like this. Anyways thank you all again. I will think awhile before I decide.",

Once she's out, she's out.\n\nAlso her reasoning for why she is entitled to money is not based in reality. She encouraged you and pushed you to start the business? So what? Many business owners have friends, family, and/or mentors that motivate them to push forward with their goals and ideas. Lots of people get help along the way in their journeys. But business owners don't compensate every single person who gives them some advice or motivation along the way. That's not sustainable. \n\nYour sister clearly had zero desire to do the work necessary to get the business to where it is now. She wanted out after TWO MONTHS?! That's basically no time or effort. She realized that there would be a lot of work that needed to be done to operate the business and she had no interest in doing any of that work. Now she wants the money earned from the hard work she was unwilling to put in. That is absolutely asinine. \n\nTell her if she wants to earn money from the business you're running, she can work as an employee on the truck and you can pay her.\n\nAnother option if she wants to feel like an owner, since you say you have the ability to scale, you can franchise the business and she can be a franchise owner. She can run her own truck but will have to pay you franchising fees etc in order to use the brand name and the brand's ingredients like any other franchise structure.\n\nUnder no circumstance should you just outright give her money.

If she is going to put you in that position then you already don't have a good relationship.\n\nI would probably respond with a no.

Doing this means he can decide when (or if) to pay you, so he doesn't have to factor it in much on his expense schedule. Basically, you're low-priority to him (and yes, you are being disrespected).\n\nIn addition, there is the [time value of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money) - the longer a payment can be delayed, the less it's worth in real-world value. Getting paid in January is worth more to you than having the same amount paid in September, and likewise delaying a payment means the customer is paying you less in value even if they're paying the same amount in raw numbers.\n\nTo mitigate this, you may want to look at including items in your contracts, such as late payment penalties that increase over time (and, at some point, become extreme enough to trigger payment), base rate increases (or loss of access to discounts) for customers who regularly pay late, or simply declining credit (including n30/n90 etc) for customers who have a history of late payments.\n\nIn addition, move everyone over to the new contract at the end of the current one - this guy should not be able to 'grandfather' themselves in just because they're a long-term customer; what they actually are is a long-term *deadbeat*.",

In his head, you’re effectively an interest-free credit line.\n\nThe reason he does it is simple: there’s no consequence. You keep delivering, so partial payments work for him.

Get a new cell number that you ONLY give to respectful clients, coworkers and family. Never use it online except for extremely secure places (eg banking and medical.) Use a voice prompt on your virtual phones such as \"you have reached AAA, if you know your party's extension, dial it now. Dial 0 to leave a message, 1 for billing, ...\" Calls can either get routed or they can leave a message. You can also set up specific numbers to ring you directly (or xfer to your cell.)\n\nSet up a temporary SMS phone number anytime you put an ad for employees, etc. That way you can delete it when no longer needed.\n\nIf these ideas would not work for you, consider hiring a service that answers the phone, follows specific scripts for various topics, and forwards only calls you want to take.",

Just over two months ago, I launched a side project that’s quickly showing potential, and I’d love some advice on how to grow it.\n\n**The concept:**\n\n• I host regular board game nights at public venues.\n\n• Entry fee is $5 cash per person for the entire evening.\n\n• People can come alone or with friends, I place them on a table, they play games (not the niche tabletop ones, more social party games), and meet new folks.\n\n**Current setup:**\n\n• I’ve built a group on a popular social app (300+ members have joined organically, though only a fraction attend these events).\n\n• So far, attendance per event has ranged from as little as 2 ppl, to as high as 23 people (although these are the extremes, I have an average attendance of 7 ppl, and am consistently trending higher in recent events). I also happen to have a pretty good return rate, and there are now 6-8 regulars.\n\n• Upfront costs: \\~$547.22 for several board games, a few bits and bobs (pens, name badges, etc) and the app membership.\n\n• Income: \\~$645.00 in total (210 the first month, and 435 the second); I’m now officially in profit.\n\n• Venue is free (local bars or food courts), so no additional costs on my part there.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n• I want to grow attendance (30 attendees per session would be solid) and attract specific crowds (young people, 20-30, as well as more women to balance it out) and better leverage social media platforms.\n\n**Questions for you (and please share any useful advice):**\n\n• How would you scale something like this without raising prices? The $5 fee matches local board game café pricing and I want to keep it the same.\n\n• As the group grows, I'm aware that hosting duties will become more and more complicated, but I'm still unsure how to proceed - should I pay someone to help me host?\n\n• I’m struggling to reconcile my financial objectives with my willingness to make sure everyone is having a good time; basically, I’m very picky with who I invite. Most of my promo so far has been done through subreddits for the town I live in and Facebook groups – I always do a background check on people first, and have a quick chat with them to gauge the kind of person they are. I do this to avoid having problematic profiles (creeps, scammers, intolerant people, you name it) but this comes at an extra effort, and also highly limits the clients I get (I must lose 50% of potential customers with this system). I know it’s a stupid question even before I ask it, but have some of you found a good way to filter out the bad weeds in a more efficient way, or do you just take the risk to have these sorts of clients anyways?\n\n• I've had some suggestions to use a subscription system, but sounds quite complicated to set up logistically, and I like the idea of people having the flexibility of paying per session. Are there any real upsides to this system?\n\n• Creative ideas to reach more people? I'm struggling to find people in their twenties - it seems most user pools I'm targeting have 30 year olds...where are all the twenty year olds?? Same goes for finding women – very few of them seem to respond to my posts…I’m trying Instagram and TikTok which I hope might attract these crowds, but growth is painfully slow.\n\n• Anything else I should keep in mind moving forward? This is my first entrepreneurial project so I’d really appreciate any insights :)",

When I bartended at a brewery we had a group that would come in every Wednesday and play big board games together, I always thought it was really fun",

          "body": "I hate to be a downer but I'm not sure this makes sense as a business. It may make more sense simply as a fun thing that you enjoy, where the entry fees defray some of your costs. As a business, you've made $100 in profits over two months while ignoring the cost of your own time, which includes hosting the game sessions themselves as well as all the time you spend promoting them and recruiting and screening attendees. If you're doing this on a larger scale then you'll also probably want liability insurance. And a larger scale also probably means it's not always you who's personally running the game nights and doing the screenings, so you'll need to pay somebody. Even if it's just you, you should include your own notional \"salary\" in your figures in order to be realistic and not fool yourself - your time is not free. Try to estimate how much you're ultimately earning per hour of effort, after considering all your costs.\n\nTo make this work, I think you need to find ways to get more income per session. $5/person seems really low. Maybe buy games at wholesale and sell physical copies during sessions at retail prices: people like instant gratification. Sell game-related T-shirts and merch. Charge a small fee to indie game companies for including/promoting their games at your sessions. Create a newsletter or social media account for the group with affiliate links to where people can purchase the games that they played, so you earn a commission. Strike a deal with a bar or restaurant to get some percentage of the tab or a flat fee if your session brings in a minimum number of extra people on a normally slow day. Offer a membership option for something like $15/month as an alternative to paying as you go - many people are lazy and will sign up but then come rarely/never.",

          "body": "Good for you. I'm not sure how long you will be able to continue charging. I attend a weekly game meetup. It's free and there are anywhere from 25 to 40 ppl in attendance. It has been going for 13 years. I would be worried at some point a few of your attendees will swap contact info and say, \"hey, let's just start meeting at X and skip the entrance fee\". I recommend introducing at least one new game a month. Keep a real close eye on BGG's lists to stay current on your game selection. This might keep people coming back. All the game stores in my area have free weekly game nights, and game libraries ranging from 10s to 100s. So you need to determine what sets your paid event apart and better than the alternatives.\n\n20s is the wrong demographic IMO. I've been to boardgame conventions and boardgame meetups. The age demographic is more like 35 to 65. I'm guessing about 75% male to female. Also, college kids are pretty savvy using social media to coordinate and would also quickly recognize they don't need to pay someone to play a game. \n\nIf you are a really good story teller or theater geek, I recommend you look into Blood on the Clocktower and start hosting BotC events. If you get really good, people would definitely pay to attend and most would be regulars. But it doesn't scale well. 10 people at $10 each for 3 hours is not really worth it unless you love it.",

But it could be done on rotation basis, adding more venues as you find them. \n\nNext is turning the event into more of an event. Making it more enticing, enough for people to get out of the house, maybe bring some of their friends and plan for it instead of taking it for granted.\n\nIf every games day/night is the same old, people are going to think they can always go to another event.

Now you can do a rotation so each event is different and people who miss out can eventually 'try' it. \n\nYou can combine the above with additional themes, dressing up/cosplay, specific games, awards and prizes, etc to make each event even more enticing. \n\nUltimately you want to target people who have money to spend.

      "selftext": "I’m 28 and I’ve been working for about a year and a half as the only assistant for the owner of a small but high revenue entertainment and business management company. It’s just me and her. No HR, no backup, no real systems. On paper it looks like a solid job. I make around 72k a year, I have autonomy, and I’m exposed to finance, payroll, taxes, and high profile clients. In reality, I am completely burnt out and wake up most mornings with a pit in my stomach.\n\nI handle almost everything. Paying company and client bills, payroll, reconciling endless bank and credit card accounts, handling physical mail and deposits, dealing with IRS and state notices, and putting out constant fires that pop up with no warning. Over time the workload has increased a lot. We onboarded new major clients, migrated banks, and are still using outdated systems that do not scale. None of that came with more support or clearer processes. The expectation is always to just figure it out. When something goes wrong, it turns into a personal issue instead of a systems issue.\n\nRecently I tried to have an honest conversation with the owner about getting help, improving processes, and talking about the future. She had previously told me that one day I could take over or buy the business, so I asked what that would even look like. She told me she has no succession plan, no long term plan, and no intention of changing how she runs things. The conversation quickly turned defensive and blame focused. It became very clear that we have completely different ways of thinking and working. I left that meeting realizing I have lost respect for her leadership and I do not see a future here.\n\nFor context, I am not afraid of hard work. I graduated college in 2020 with a bachelor’s degree in business administration. Before this job, I worked in high end real estate sales at a brokerage that even had a Netflix show, but I left because the culture and status games were extremely toxic. Before that, I worked restaurant jobs, grocery stores, manual labor, home inspections, and even admissions at a major health system. I stayed at every job for over a year and I have always shown up and done what was asked of me. I am proud that I have been able to handle this level of responsibility at my age, but I am realizing that responsibility without support is not growth. It is just burnout.\n\nRight now I feel stuck. I know I cannot do this long term. It is affecting my mental and physical health. At the same time, I am scared to quit without another job lined up. This role is so custom built that even a standard two week notice feels unrealistic. My current plan is to stay professional, emotionally detach, do what is required, and quietly start applying elsewhere while I am still employed.\n\nI am looking for outside perspective. Is it reasonable to job search while mentally checked out like this? How do I frame this role to future employers without trashing my current boss? Are these red flags that mean I should leave sooner rather than later? And has anyone else been in a small business role where everything falls on one person, and how did you get out?",

Here's how it works:\n\n* You send me your top 3-5 vendor contracts/invoices OR we have a quick 15-min call\n* I analyze them over 2-3 days\n* I show you exactly where you're overpaying (usually $30K-$100K)\n* I give you specific strategies to capture those savings\n\n**No cost. No pitch. No obligation.**\n\n**Why free?** I need case studies and testimonials to build my practice. If I find real savings and you want help capturing them, we can discuss working together at that point. But the audit itself is completely free.\n\n**Best fit for:**\n\n* 50-300 employee companies\n* Significant vendor spend (software, services, IT, supplies)\n* No dedicated procurement person\n* Want to reduce costs but don't know where to start\n\n**What you get:**\n\n* Report showing specific savings opportunities\n* Dollar amounts for each vendor\n* 15-min call to walk through findings\n\nI've led vendor consolidation projects that saved $340K+ annually and managed 50+ vendor relationships. I know how to find money on the table.\n\n**DM me if interested!** I'm limiting this to 10 companies so I can give proper attention to each one.\n\nHappy to answer any questions below.",

And there's some graphic design and signage lessons you might need to watch.\n\nReal quickly I can list out a few.  Way - way back in the day I used to do mailers. I was the lead graphic designer.\n\n* Don't say shit that you don't do on the job. \"We won't break your windows.\"\n\n* Don't claim things that should be obvious to your trade.  \"We are clean and use sterol equipment at our dentist office.\"\n\n* The main thing you need to get out there is \"who\" you are, \"what\" you can offer, and \"how\" they can get in touch.  Optionally, \"where\" you are located maybe relevant.  So you may want to include that as well. \n\n* Slogans are risky but can be rewarding. Keep it short and make sure it sounds and reads well.  Ask a friend if it's appropriate too.  \n\n* Adding discounts and other incentives should be reserved, strict and limited.  Offering someone 50% off of something calls into question the value of what you're offering.  Instead offer 10 or 15% off for a limited time under a limited condition. \n\n* Don't use fonts and graphics that you can't read.  Do a thumbnail test.  You can shrink down your ad very very small on your screen.  If you can still see what's what, you're good.  \n\n* It's super risky to include photos - cartoons and graphics are okay.  Most of the time a photo feels inappropriate and off-putting with some added liability.  Using pictures of employees is a time bomb, hire actors if needed.  Never include your own face in a photo unless you're a real estate agent. There are exceptions, but do so at your own risk.   A picture of a work vehicle or fleet is one of the exceptions.  People like to see you're a permanent, established business. \n\n\n* Avoid light on white, dark on dark, or any similar color on color text and graphics.  While it may be cool to have your gray logo on a black background.  It's going to look like noise to someone who has half a second to see your ad.  If you do want to do this still, consider adding an outline around your graphic or text.\n\n* Avoid tangents. This is complicated to explain with words.  Essentially, it's when a perceived line touches another perceived line which makes viewers uncomfortable.  For example, the point of a square touching the edge of a page.  Or the edge of the square touching the edge of the page or a border of another graphic. See link. https://share.google/aLoGXHnmUfPyslBeQ\n\n* This one is tough for me. Proofread your work.  Or get an AI to help you with it.  I'm super bad at proofing because I'm dyslexic.  But if you misspell even one word - even when it is intentional, potential customers will look down on you. (This one is really touchy. I've had to call clients, telling them we corrected typos and they would get stupid angry.  If someone points out something odd about your ads, please use your business brain. They are not attacking you, they are bringing up real concerns about making money.)\n\n\nI don't know if this is what you're looking for.  I think you want to know more about the logistics of ad placement and frequency.  But I thought I'd chime in with this little tidbit.",

When you don't know exactly where the friction is, every bad day feels like a personal failure instead of just a data point to be adjusted.\nIn my experience, restructuring for a shop at your level usually boils down to three things:\n\n1.Are you sending all your traffic to the same landing page? If you segment your entry points (Ads/Social) by audience intent, your conversion reliability goes up, and your stress goes down.\n\n2.Often, it’s not the ad failing; it’s a failure in how the user moves from the ad to the sale. If you isolate exactly where they drop off, you don't have to guess what to fix.\n\n3.You mentioned using AI for monitoring, but are your DMs and Email flows automated? Replacing manual handling with structured flows is the fastest way to lower management cost and mental load.\n\nSo in general even though this might sound harsh, the stress doesn't magically go away when you spend over 10k, it only stabilizes when you move from fragmented activity to a coherent revenue system.\n\nThere is a bunch of more variables which could play a part depending on industry among other things but I hope that helped.

You don't need to hyper optimize your ads strategy right now if it's doing *good enough*.\n\nStill, it did take me a solid 6-10 months of learning and making mistakes and optimizing my approach before I felt like I was getting more revenue out of them then I was spending. It got to the point where I've had them disabled for the past few months because now we have too much work.\n\nIt's important to not constantly hyper fixate and tweak - make a decision and let it run for a week or two before deciding to analyze your approach. Ads work best on the long game.\n\nMinor advice: if you're a hands on person who helps run a leads based business like I am, you might find way more success using manual CPC vs trying to optimize for max clicks of whatever AI based garbage google &amp; their salespeople wants to sell you. A lot of the other ad strategies are optimized entirely for major brands or people looking to have global reach with the money to waste on it. You will blow a LOT of money on garbage traffic doing max clicks, pmax, or AI run campaigns. If you are running your own ads, do manual CPC and then ideally once you get enough data from that you can run campaigns that target conversions hooks you've set up. Make sure you have a good landing page. That's 80% of the battle right there.",

The irony is the checking creates the anxiety you’re trying to manage.\nWhat changes at higher spend isn’t that fear disappears, it’s that patterns get clearer and you stop reacting to every blip. People who feel calm at 10k plus aren’t braver, they’ve just accepted longer decision windows and fewer levers. The moment you start judging ads day by day, you’ve already lost the mental game.\nIf it were me, I’d simplify before I outsourced. Fewer campaigns, fewer changes, fixed review days. Agencies don’t remove uncertainty, they just move it out of sight while you pay for the privilege. The relief only sticks if the structure is sound. Otherwise you’re still anxious, just with invoices.\nSo yes, you’re overthinking, but it’s understandable. The fix isn’t another dashboard.

Managing your own ads can feel like a constant grind, especially when you’re dropping a couple grand a month and second-guessing every tweak. I’ve seen a lot of folks in your shoes-fun at first, then the stress piles up. The thing with tools like Claude and Ryze AI is they monitor, but don’t necessarily take the guesswork off your plate.\n\nIf you’re looking for something that actually runs, tests, and scales ads for you without needing an agency or turning it into a full-time job, there’s stuff like Didoo AI that digs into your actual business before building the right audience and creatives. It lets you stop obsessing over every detail and actually see better ROAS without blowing budgets on trial and error. Even better, it emails you a weekly report that spells out exactly what happened and which tweaks it made. For pocket change you get top-tier agency service, It could take a load off your mind.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, stress doesn’t magically go away just because you spend more. It’s more about having a system that runs itself intelligently so you can sleep at night. Overthinking? Maybe a bit, but also smart-ads aren’t cheap and should be working for you, not stressing you out.",

I have a staff of 8 full time employees. They’re all awesome and we do gorgeous, inspiring, impactful work. But I’m frankly exhausted. I’m tired of feeding the revenue monster every month to meet payroll, insurance, and other overhead. Our steady clients for the most part are lovely people with great missions. But they’re getting their scopes continually cut. There are a few who tend to try and take advantage. And I have to be on top of them to make sure they don’t. Navigating health insurance this year has been a nightmare. I wake up in a cold sweat at 4 am wondering if we are going to need to cut staff. We were in a position to buy a building last year but that money is dwindling because no one is willing to sign contracts. I am doing my absolute best to keep the pipeline going but people are just reluctant to sign anything right now. I was a creative director / art director at a multinational agency before I started this agency making well into the 6 figures and I’ve been paying myself half of what I made when I went full time on the business 7 years ago. I’m exhausted and not sure if I can keep going…not sure it’s worth enough to sell (our gross revenue last year was over $800k), or if I need to pair down and just freelance a few of the clients we have contracts with and cut everyone else loose or just shut it down and see what else is out there…so my question Redditors who owned a business, when do you know it was time to walk away?\n\nEdit: employee count (mistype)\n\nEdit: Thank you for the thoughtful comments. Yes I have gotten a lot of value out of what we’ve been able to accomplish especially as it relates to doing good work for the communities we serve. More than money really. But unfortunately still need money to live. I know the margin looks whack. But the location we’re in is a lower cost of living and most of my employees take well below market value in their salaries because of the nature of the work we do. They’re still paid living wages and benefits, but I recognize that their salaries are lower. And I’d really love to pay them more but the clients aren’t multi billion dollar brands themselves. What prompted this post was a client emailing to say they can’t pay for a few months but can they lump hours in the spring and I about lost my mind. To those recommending a pivot, absolutely. We’re looking to move into some other categories for stabilization. It’s just not happening fast enough to keep up with payroll. I recognize I may need to adjust the composition of our staff, but in this economy it’s making my heart hurt to have to do that.",

But if you’re unsure, I completely understand. There are very few people who know what it feels like to walk away from a business.

How was it in Year 2? Year 4? Year 7? Take a second and think back on how you felt at all of those points. If it's been 9 years of thankless grinding, maybe selling is the way to go. If you've found the journey fulfilling up to this point, there's a good chance you'll continue to find it fulfilling once you've steered your way out of these storms. \n\nYour lifetime earning potential running a small agency like you have been is probably never going to square up favorably with a corporate job, but you've been doing this for the last nine years regardless. There's got to be a reason for that, and it's up to you to take a long hard look at yourself to figure out if it's a good reason or not and what needs to change for you to be happy with where you're headed.\n\nEdit: I have a relative who does marketing and design for local interest groups and nonprofits.

This way I could see what the company charged, I got the benefit of seeing a completed project with progress photos and a good description of the work done. \n\nThis gives me an idea about what my similar project could cost while building trust in a company. \n\nIt's a lot of work, but gaining qualified customers should be a priority vs just getting random RFQ clicks. \n\nIt would be amazing if companies that build websites and marketing campaigns explained good metrics and KPIs vs the bullshit metrics and KPIs that small businesses have been trained to rely on for determining if their campaigns are successful or not.\n\nEdit to add: I built websites and online apps for 28 years for marketing agencies. It always pissed me off to hear the stakeholders given metrics about \"time on site\", click thru rates that don't matter, and page views as metrics that meant a campaign was successful. They mean shit to be honest. Then there was that phase where every bit of content had to be within 3 clicks of a home page. Like seriously WTAF? Properly indexing your content into appropriate buckets and having a logical hierarchical structure is more important than shoehorning disparate content wells next to each other confusing both search engines, your internal search, and the end user about the actual context of a page or section. I wish more agencies were honest about KPIs and how they actually matter to the end result.",

People don't want to talk to sales anymore; they want answers immediately. \n\nI moved our entire intake process over to inv⁤olve.me and built a custom price estimator that changes based on the features the client selects. It wasn't gimmicky at all-in fact, our lead quality shot up because the \"tire-kickers\" who weren't ready for our price point filtered themselves out, and the serious leads came in much warmer. Their dynamic form builder is honestly much more flexible if you need to do actual math or conditional logic behind the scenes.",

The stand in question sells baked goods and prepared food (no cooking is allowed in this market due to lack of ventilation).  It's VERY tough to get into this market without buying an existing stand.\n\nBusiness has been established since early 2000s and includes several refrigerated display cases, as well as everything needed to sell prepared goods.\n\nHere's the stumbling point:\n\n* It's run by a husband and wife team, they say they work 40 hours/week each.\n* They employ two part-time workers to food prep and sell food at the stand.\n* They employ a full-time baker.\n* The buyer has to provide their own commercial kitchen - the business has a separate kitchen that does not come with the business.\n* Net sales are 400k/year, net profit is $100k/year (they are optimistic about bringing that to $150k/year with wholesale/catering but haven't done it).\n\nThey want $320k for what appears to be $20k of assets plus a market stand, where the profits are about $50k/owner/year to work full-time and manage employees.\n\nI'm thinking that this should sell for closer to $150k - am I crazy or are they?\n\n",

Strong growth in profits? 1.1-1.2. Flat growth? 0.95-1.05. Declining profits? 0.8-0.9. \n\nFair market value of assets is tricky but you can just go to Facebook marketplace and look for similar.

The separate kitchen doesn't come with the business, but can a contract be put in place? What relevance is the full-time baker if they (presumably) work in the separate kitchen?\n\nIt sounds like the sellers are banking on an attractive location, established reputation, and \"could make\" $X level. You don't pay them for the incremental increase you have to pursue, so that last factor is irrelevant. My thoughts are the key, at least in the short term, is ensuring continuity of product availability and quality, particularly if you don't already have ovens or a third-party baker. Take a long, hard look at that part of the equation. Would your COGS be commensurate as what they were doing when they were, effectively, baking in-house?\n\nBeyond that, I would have to assume the location is a large part of the intangible value given retail bakers don't typically have much else that's readily long-lived and transferrable. And I'd get a sense of the sellers' intentions once they offload this location. If they're so good that they can forget this location and just start another near or at their bakery, and simply market themselves as \"We moved to...\" and undercut your prospective operations, then all you'd really be receiving is their stand at a historic location.",

Anything consistently above that is either very efficient, very niche, or not fully counting costs yet. Plenty of people doing big top-line numbers are sitting in the single digits or even barely break-even.\n\nFor most, margins have gotten worse over the past year. Ads are more expensive, shipping hasn’t fully come back down, returns are higher, and software creep is real. You have to work harder now to protect the same margin you used to get more easily.\n\nThe biggest “aha” moments usually come from indirect costs. Ad inefficiency hidden by scaling, subscriptions that seemed cheap individually but added up, returns and refunds quietly eroding profit, and labor time that wasn’t being costed properly. A lot of people realize too late that growth masked leaks instead of fixing them.\n\nIf you’re still profitable, cash-flow positive, and not burning out, you’re probably doing better than you think. The real lever usually isn’t more revenue, it’s tightening one or two big leaks. Most margin improvements come from fewer moving parts, not bigger swings.",

If you deal with commodities COGS could creep and you might not be raising prices to match the market. If you’re in a competitive service business it could be customer acquisition costs creeping. \n\nI copy my monthly PNL over to excel and any monthly expense that is higher than average is formatted to be highlighted in red.
