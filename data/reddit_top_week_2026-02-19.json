      "selftext": "Tracking every dollar because debt, so I got tired of wasting time on things that don't work, here's 6 months of testing everything.\n\nSurveys (swagbucks, survey junkie) made $47 over 2 months before quitting, takes forever and constant disqualifications, maybe $3/hour if lucky.\n\nFood delivery made $890 in 3 months but car maintenance went up $300 and gas was another $200 so net profit $390 for like 60 hours, exhausting and barely worth it.\n\nReselling on marketplace and ebay made $340 profit over 4 months, decent but just know that it requires upfront money and dealing with flaky buyers, I’m okay with that so all good\n\nFreelance writing on upwork applied to probably 50 gigs, got 2 responses, made $150 total, competition is insane and rates are terrible.\n\nDrop shipping lost $200, total scam unless you have serious capital.\n\nCredit card rewards churning made about $600 in signup bonuses over 6 months, this one's legit if you're disciplined and pay everything off.\n\nSettlement claims filed through Settlemate for data breaches and product recalls made $780 over 6 months, takes maybe 20 min per claim then you wait, way less active time than most other things, some payouts were $8 some were $200 average around $65, but just know that it requires patience\n\nDog walking local was my winner, made $1400 over 6 months walking dogs before and after work, it's exercise the dogs are cute money is reliable.\n\nMost \"passive income\" is BS or requires way more work than admitted, things that worked were either truly low effort (credit cards, settlements) or active work I didn't mind (dogs).\n\nDon't believe the $5k/month working 2 hours a week hype, it's not real.\n\nTotal earned $3,707 over 6 months, after expenses $3,307, not amazing but better than nothing when trying to pay down $40k debt.",

I’m getting about 10 which does add up.  I just recently started this and have made an extra 1.5k in a month.  If I actually get 40 hrs I can make 12k pre tax plus my regular job wages which would be like 20k/ month.

      "selftext": "I jumped into the event rental business (weddings, parties, etc) in June 2024. I realized how lucrative the wedding industry is and after spending a couple months watching TheRentalGuy on YouTube, I decided to take a shot.\n\nI had no idea how small or large I wanted to be. So, as most of us do, I faked it until I made it. After the LLC, I created a logo and put a listing on Facebook marketplace for table and chair rentals — the standard white padded chairs, round and rectangular tables. I posted about 8pm on a Friday and by 8:30pm I received my first booking… for a 300 person party! I owned nothing. I almost turned it down but instead I decided to ensure it was legitimate by meeting for a cash 50% deposit. I then spent $10k purchasing the equipment new (the rental was for $1500 a few months later, so I had time).\n\nI made 8k that August-December, then in 2025 business picked up about February again (seasonal) and I cleared just at 40k by EOY.\n\nThe 2 things I underestimated the most was the sheer size and space you need — I ran it out of a 16x22 detached garage. I had enough room to move around but had to be strategic. The other thing is the maintenance (chairs mainly). The white chairs need to be cleaned about half the time after being rented out. That takes most of my time. The preparation. I have some late Friday nights if I push it off until then to prep for the weekend, but on the weekends I’m spending maybe 3-4 hours before noon each day delivering and picking up. Some weeks a lot less work depending on the shape of the equipment and different factors.\n\nIt is the least passive of income there is. I’ve since purchased an enclosed trailer. And I’m worn out a lot.  If I can say no anytime. But on the other hand, once it’s paid off, it sure if nice to make a random $500 for maybe 2 hours worth of work on a Saturday morning. Between March and October, some weekends I make $200, others I make $3000. It’s solely up to how much time and inventory you have.\n\nYear 1 was a larger scale than I expected and I spread myself thin at times but I can scale back as much as I want. Even with 1/4 the equipment, a lot of $ can be made. It’s a great side hustle if you have the physical ability.",

The catch is nobody tells you about it, obviously they are not going to announce that stuff, you have to go find it yourself.  \n  \nEach claim takes maybe 15-20 min, most don't even need receipts, just need you to confirm you used whatever service during the right dates, I've gotten checks for $8 and checks for $340. average is probably around $75, but just know that it takes time  \n  \nAt first I was just googling and checking sites manually, it was okay but I couldnt remember all the services I used like 4 years ago (I cant even remember what I had for lunch yesterday lol), around june I tried using settlemate bc it flags based on actual purchases and accounts, I try to batch them, knock out 3-4 claims during lunch or while watching something.  \n  \nThe downsides are real tho, money is slow as hell, some pay in 6 weeks, some take like 8 months, you need patience, also this isn't replacing actual income, it's more like the same category as survey apps or cashback stuff, small effort, small returns, but it adds up.  \n  \nIf you're already doing beer money type things this fits right in, won't make you rich but $1200 for maybe 10 total hours of work spread across the year really helped me, I track everything in a spreadsheet so I know what's pending vs what already hit.",

Did food delivery shifts on nights I wasn't interviewing and that added another $250 or so after tips. Picked up a few one-off gigs on Fiverr for editing and voiceover stuff and that netted maybe $150. Also tutored a neighbor's kid twice a week and got about $100 out of that.\n\nI even tried Mistplay for a week just to see what it was like, no drama there, but it was barely a blip compared to the other stuff. Overall it was messy and tiring but the thing that surprised me was how fast selling things locally moved money. The reliable platforms and real gigs paid steadier than the random micro options. Not saying this is a plan, just sharing what actually happened when I was desperate and had time to hustle. Maybe others had similar mixes? idk.",

Did it mostly while waiting for coffee or on the bus in the mornings , nothing fancy, just a few sessions a day. \n\nOutcome: not nearly as lucrative as the hype. After about three weeks I had maybe $10–20 worth of gift cards/points across everything and one app hit a payout threshold that took forever to reach. A couple of apps (Mistplay was one I tried) gave small rewards here and there but also felt like a grind, and one locked my account for a day which was annoying. \n\nIt wasn't a scam, more like a low-value time sink for me , fine if you want something mindless while watching Netflix, but not something I'd call a reliable side hustle. Felt weirdly satisfying to see the tiny payout land, though, like finding coins in the couch.",

Before the semester started, I quit my job because I was miserable and I knew I would get stable income if I enrolled again (I receive educational benefits). However, I still want money to spoil myself. I had issues getting my unis work-study application available to me before all spots were taken. I’m looking for a direct wage job, but in the meantime, would like a decent side gig. \n\nIve done both irl and online jobs, mostly customer service. Recently, I’ve been making my fun money with random construction gigs (my family has a business, but really only looks for work when money is tight) and online “modeling” and “acting” (I’m doing it anyways, why not record it and sell it 🤷).  \n\nI’m ideally looking for something less labor intensive than construction, less boring than work at home or less stressful constant phone calls. (I understand I might be picky, but I’m open to both ideal and realistic suggestions! Thank you &lt;3)",

It gets the job done, but before I invest more time and money or lock myself into one setup long-term, I want to make sure I’m choosing something that fits how I actually work. Since this isn’t my main job, I care a lot about simple setup, stability during live events, and not having to troubleshoot when guests are waiting.\n\nI’d love to hear from people who explored different options before scaling up.

      "selftext": "I'm an accountant and last June I was watching TikTok at midnight when I saw some faceless account explaining credit cards with 2 million views. I thought I could do that and made my first video the next day.\n\nGot 147 views. My mom didn't even watch it.\n\nMade 11 more videos over three weeks. Highest was 380 views. Gave up for a month because it felt pointless. Then in August I posted one about savings accounts and it randomly got 50k views overnight. No idea why that one worked.\n\nThat's when I actually tried. The free text to speech sounded awful so I switched to APOB for the avatar stuff. It's not perfect, someone commented \"bro sounds like he's underwater\" which was fair, but I can make a video in 15 minutes now.\n\nI post 3 or 4 times a week after dinner. Account is at 7400 followers. Some videos get 30k views, some get 900. I made one explaining APR that I thought was solid and it died at 600 views. Then made one about Costco memberships as a joke and it got 40k. Algorithm is completely random.\n\nMoney breakdown last month: $47 from creator fund, $248 from affiliate link in my bio, had 31 people sign up for a budgeting app I actually use, and $45 from three people who Venmo'd me to answer credit questions which was weird but whatever. Total $340.\n\nThis month is tracking around $280. It's not consistent and definitely not quit your job money but it covers internet, Spotify, and usually leaves enough for drinks on the weekend. Takes maybe 2 hours a week total.\n\nWeirdest part is people think I'm some finance guru now. Someone asked me to manage their portfolio. I'm an accountant at a mid size firm, I just know how credit cards work because I explained it to my little brother five times.\n\nAlso had someone spam \"is this AI\" on every video so I started responding \"yes I'm a robot beep boop\" and they stopped.\n\nIf you're thinking about this just pick something you know and start posting. First 15 videos will probably suck. One will randomly hit and you'll figure it out. Don't expect thousands of dollars but $200-300 a month for basically no effort is doable.\n\nStill think it's kind of dumb but my roommate stopped making fun of me after I paid for pizza with TikTok money so I guess that's something.",

You never know which one will hit. \n\nI wrote a newsletter about a banger side hustle: local newsletters. Talked to several people making $5k-$15k/month from it. Poured my heart in it. Got no clicks, no replies nothing. \n\nAnother newsletter about reddit ghostwriting which i just winged it using claude &amp; didn’t put much time in it.

      "selftext": "I’ve been researching side hustles that actually work for my newsletter but every post it’s the same recycled advice. Start a podcast. Sell printables. Drive for DoorDash. Do surveys. I got tired of seeing the same surface-level ideas repeated by people who clearly weren’t doing any of them.\n\nSo I went deep into Reddit threads, Discord servers, and niche communities to find what’s actually working for regular people right now.\n\nHere’s what kept coming up again and again\n\n1. AI-generated influencer accounts\n\nThis one sounds wild but it’s real. People are creating entirely AI-generated personas using tools like Midjourney, Flux, and HeyGen, then running them as influencer accounts on Instagram and TikTok.\n\nThe persona posts content around a niche like fitness, finance, or tech reviews. Brand deals still come in because engagement is what matters, not whether the face is real. Some people are running two or three of these at once.\n\nThe key is picking a tight niche and staying consistent with the character so the audience feels like they’re following a real person.\n\n2. Hyperlocal newsletters\n\nThis is one of the most underrated plays out there. People are starting simple email newsletters covering local news, events, restaurant openings, and community stuff for their city or neighborhood. You write one or two emails a week using a free tool like Beehiiv or Substack.\n\nOnce you hit a few thousand subscribers, local businesses will pay surprisingly well to sponsor a slot. It works because big media ignores small towns and neighborhoods, so there’s almost no competition.\n\nA guy in a mid-sized suburb shared that he’s pulling in over two thousand a month just from a twice-weekly newsletter about his area.\n\n3. Claude chatbot setups for small businesses\n\nSmall business owners keep hearing about AI but have no idea how to actually use it. People are charging anywhere from three hundred to over a thousand dollars to set up Claude-powered chatbots and workflows for local businesses.\n\nThink automated customer support for a dentist’s office, a booking assistant for a salon, or a lead qualifier for a contractor. You use tools like Claude, Zapier, and Make to wire it all together. No coding needed.\n\nOnce you’ve built a few, you can reuse templates and the work gets faster every time. Most clients will come from cold outreach or local Facebook groups.\n\n4. Amazon KDP low-content and AI-assisted books\n\nKindle Direct Publishing is still quietly printing money for people who understand the system. The sweet spot right now is using AI to help research niches, outline content, and draft specialized nonfiction like study guides, prompt collections, niche how-to books, and curated resource lists. You’re not publishing AI slop novels.\n\nThe people doing well are targeting very specific keywords with real demand and thin competition. One person shared they were making around fifteen hundred a month from a catalog of about forty short books, most of which took a day or two each to put together.\n\n5. Twitter ghostwriting\n\nBuilding a personal brand on X is a grind, but plenty of founders, executives, and creators are willing to pay someone else to do it for them. Ghostwriters handle everything from drafting daily posts to writing long threads and managing engagement.\n\nPay ranges from five hundred to several thousand per month per client depending on scope. If you can write in a punchy, opinionated style and understand what performs well on the platform, this is steady recurring income.\n\nMost ghostwriters land their first clients by simply being active on X themselves and DMing people whose accounts look neglected.\n\n6. No-code iOS apps\n\nTools like FlutterFlow, Adalo, and Draftbit have made it possible to build and ship real apps to the App Store without writing a line of code.\n\nPeople are building simple utility apps, habit trackers, niche calculators, and local service directories, then monetizing through subscriptions or one-time purchases. The barrier to entry is lower than ever.\n\nOne person in a community I follow launched a niche workout timer app and was making around eight hundred a month within three months. The trick is solving a very specific problem for a very specific audience rather than trying to compete with big apps.\n\nNone of these require a massive upfront investment or some rare technical skill. They just take consistency and willingness to learn new things.\n\nI have written detailed posts about these on my [newsletter](http://wifimoolah.com). It’s free and I do not sell anything\n\nHas anyone here tried any of these or found other low-key hustles that are actually working right now?",

At least it’s specific.\n\nThe pattern across all of these isn’t “AI magic.”  \nIt’s distribution + niche focus + packaging boring work in a smarter way.\n\nA few thoughts:\n\nAI influencer accounts  \nThis works, but only if you treat it like a real brand. Most people underestimate how hard it is to build consistent content and audience trust. The ones making money aren’t just generating pretty images. They’re running it like a media business.\n\nHyperlocal newsletters  \nThis one is quietly strong. Attention is cheaper locally. And local sponsors convert because it’s high intent. But again, distribution is the game. If you can’t grow the list, it dies.\n\nClaude setups for SMBs  \nThis feels like the most durable one on the list. It’s not sexy, but small businesses don’t want to “learn AI.” They want outcomes. Lead capture. Booking automation. Follow-ups. Whoever owns that layer wins.\n\nKDP  \nStill works, but it’s keyword research and volume. Less “author,” more “operator.” Most people quit before they build enough surface area.\n\nGhostwriting  \nThe moat isn’t writing. It’s understanding positioning and audience psychology. Big difference.\n\nOverall takeaway for me:  \nThe real opportunity isn’t in the tactic. It’s in becoming the person who can package and systemize the tactic.\n\nCurious though - if you had to double down on just one of these for 12 months, which one would you actually bet your own time on?",

It’s **distribution**.\n\n# 2. Automation → Sell Setup\n\n* Claude chatbots\n* No-code apps\n\nThis is “AI confusion arbitrage.”  \nBusinesses don’t pay for AI. They pay for **done-for-you outcomes**.\n\nThe real leverage here?  \nTurn your first build into a repeatable template and sell installs via something like Whop (productized service + easy checkout).\n\n# 3. Asset Stacking\n\n* KDP books\n\nThis is volume + keyword game.  \nNot sexy. Just compounding digital shelf space.\n\nIf someone wants to win in 2026, the real decision isn’t *which hustle*.\n\nIt’s:\n\n* Do I want to build an audience?\n* Or sell infrastructure?\n* Or stack digital assets?\n\nPick one lane. Go deep for 6-12 months.\n\nMost people fail because they sample all 6.",

I’ve seen people use **Keyvello** to automate the entire production of these niches. It has these specific 'ASMR Food' and 'Satisfying' templates that handle the pacing and sound triggers automatically.\n\nIt's perfect for people who want to run 3+ accounts at once without spending 4 hours a day in an editor. If you’re already using Midjourney/Flux for the persona, running the final video through an automation tool like that makes the 'consistency' part you mentioned a lot less painful.\n\nCurious, have you seen any specific niches in the hyperlocal newsletters (#2) that are scaling faster than others?

Like properly formatted ones I made for myself before exams, nothing crazy. Uploaded maybe 18 documents total and then just never thought about it again.\n\nLogged back in and theres $340 sitting there. Not insane money but its literally from doing nothing, the notes were already made, I just converted them to PDF and put them up.\n\nThe wild part is a few of them are still selling consistently. My corporate valuation summary gets like 2 or 3 sales a month still. I keep that money completely separate, its kind of become part of my saved money pile that I use to fund other small stuff like this.\n\nIf youre in uni or just finished I genuinely think this is one of the most overlooked things.

There are mechanisms to basically rent all these things individually or as a group and collect rent/passive income.  \n\n\nAnother term for passive income is rent.  Even when you put money into 4% bank account, you are essentially renting money to the bank (so they can lend it out to bottowers at higher rate)\n\n\nEverything else is essentially a job.  Sometimes you can work to create an asset that can get passive income in the future.  You can build a house with your hands, you can create a copyright song, you can create and patent a toy/device.  You created an asset and now you can rent it out. ",

          "body": "One of the most boring but reliable paths is skill based freelancing that eventually turns into repeat clients. It is not passive at first, but once you build a few steady clients or retainers, it becomes predictable monthly income. The unsexy part is doing outreach and starting conversations. I have helped many freelancers land their first clients using a simple outreach based method, and once they had 3 to 5 steady clients, income became much more stable.\n\nDigital products are another boring but steady model. Simple templates, planners, niche guides, or industry specific resources created once and sold repeatedly on platforms like Gumroad or Etsy. It usually takes a few months of testing and improving, but once one product gains traction, it can quietly generate monthly sales without much maintenance.\n\nNiche websites also fall into this category. Writing helpful articles around specific problems, monetized with affiliate links or ads, is slow at the beginning. For the first several months, it can feel like nothing is happening. But once content ranks and traffic compounds, it can turn into steady revenue. It is not glamorous, and it requires patience.\n\nPrint on demand is similar. Upload designs, test niches, optimize listings. Most designs will not sell much. But a few that connect with a niche audience can produce consistent monthly sales over time. It is repetitive work, not exciting work.\n\nDividends and index funds are probably the most boring of all. They require capital and time, and the returns look small at the beginning. But they are predictable and compound over the long term.\n\nThe pattern across all of these is the same. None of them are fast. Most take 3 to 12 months before they feel meaningful. What makes them work is choosing one, building systems around it, and sticking with it long enough for compounding to kick in.\n\nThe most unsexy income streams are usually the ones built on consistency and simple repeatable processes rather than viral wins.\n\nI’ve been breaking down these strategies step by step in my newsletter, you can find the link in my bio if you are interested.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been building and growing my app for almost 1.5 years now and managed to get it to a point I can actually be proud of.\n\nFor context, my app is an [AI cofounder](https://aicofounder.com) for solopreneurs. It helps them think, move forward, and make better decisions based on real-world data.\n\nI’ve learned many lessons on my journey and I thought I'd share a few tips based on what worked for me.\n\nI hope this will be helpful for those of you who want to get into building apps or side projects yourself.\n\n1. validate your idea before you start building.\n2. just because someone else has done it, doesn’t mean you can’t compete. execution is so important and you have no idea how well they’re doing it.\n3. solve your own problem and let this decide if you’re b2b or b2c. both come with pros and cons. don’t listen to people who try to paint a black/white picture of it.\n4. don’t chase investors. focus on getting users instead and investors will come knocking on your door.\n5. getting your first paying customers is the hardest part by far. do things that don’t scale to get them.\n6. keep your product free at the start. controversial opinion maybe, but it’s how i did it and it got me feedback and testimonials that helped me grow fast and make a lot of money later on.\n7. building a good product comes down to thinking about what your users want.\n8. inspiration is the design key when you’re new. don’t build your own landing page from scratch, copy different sections from the tools you love the most and make it your own this way.\n9. post online daily. x, reddit, linkedin, tiktok, whatever suits you and your target audience.\n10. i’m bootstrapped and therefore highly recommend it. work a 9-5 until you have 1-2 years of runway (living cheap), then go all in.\n11. you earn the right to paid ads by getting organic marketing to work first. ads aren’t $100 in, X customers out. you’ll burn thousands just trying to learn it.\n12. define your most important metrics and track them. they should be the pillars that guide all your decisions.\n13. if you’re not passionate about what you’re building, it’s going to be difficult to keep going through the early stage where you might not see results for months.\n14. the first few minutes of your app is a promise to the user: this app will help you achieve your goal. so put a lot of effort into the beginning to convert more people.\n15. have an mvp mindset with everything you do. get the minimal version out asap then use feedback to improve it.\n16. having a co-founder that matches your ambition is the single greatest advantage for success.\n17. good testimonials will increase the perceived value of your product.\n18. always refund people that want a refund.\n19. marketing is constant experimentation to learn what works. speed up the process by drawing inspiration from what works for similar products.\n20. don’t be cheap when you hire an accountant, you’ll save time and money by spending more.",

Running 10 fanpages though means you're probably drowning in repetitive DMs and comments asking the same stuff over and over, which cuts into time you could spend scaling or creating better content. One thing that might help with the engagement overload is setting up better automated responses for teh FAQ stuff.\n\nI've read about creators using tools like Isonic that convert your existing content into a chatbot so fans can get instant answers without you being glued to your phone. It supposedly helps capture sales from people who would otherwise just ghost after asking questions. Worth looking into if you're trying to monetize those fan interactions more efficiently without adding hours to your day.\n\nEither way, what you've built is solid. The fact that you're thinking about group calls and paid consultations shows you're already thinking like a real business owner.",

Please know that I am open to anything; customer service, freelance writing… anything legitimate. \n\nAlso, after Wed I won’t have a computer as I’m selling the one I have. So I’m hoping to find something legitimate working from my phone until I can replace the one I’m selling. \n\nI am truly grateful for any information you guys are willing to share.  This is like my last resort.  I’m tired of feeling helpless and need to do something that can get me out of a financial nightmare.\n\nPlease. 🥹",

In 2026, you can manage many data tasks directly from a smartphone using mobile versions of Google Sheets, Excel, or even basic SQL editors.\n\n**Immediate Phone-Based Steps:**\n\n* **Virtual Data Assistant:** Use the Upwork or Freelancer apps to look for 'Data Cleanup' or 'Excel Spreadsheet' tasks. Many small businesses just need someone to organize their CSV exports or write a few complex formulas—tasks you can handle on a mobile browser or app.\n* **Microtasking for Data:** Check out **Clickworker** or **Amazon Mechanical Turk**. They have data labeling and categorization tasks that require the logic you already have from SQL. It’s not a full salary, but it can help with groceries immediately.\n* **Content Automation:** Since you understand data structures, you could set up a 'Data-Driven' faceless channel using a tool like **Keyvello**. It has templates that can turn simple data facts (like financial or health stats) into videos in minutes. It’s 100% phone-friendly and can build that passive foundation you’re looking for.\n\nFocus on the freelance apps first to get that immediate cash flow.

      "selftext": "About 6 months ago I started a small online baby clothes store as a side income.Just a basic website with a few designs\n\nTbh the first two to three months were depressing. Nearly all of my sales came from friends, neighbors and people I personally told. The store had customers but no matter how much I changed the prices or the pictures strangers weren't purchasing.\n\nThen I started searching like a customer like newborn winter outfits or best baby clothes brands. My brand did not show up. Thats when I realized people simply couldn’t find my store.\n\nWhat I actually did:\n\n* Updated product descriptions using language that customers really use to find\n* Added basic FAQs parents usually worry about (sizing, fabric comfort and washing)\n* Wrote simple guides to help first-time parents choose outfits\n* reorganized the categories to make the website easier to use.\n* I focused on the appropriate descriptions and instructions by using a tool to determine which places and search terms were bringing attention to my products.\n\nThese days the store consistently generates monthly sales and I probably put in two to three hours a week to maintain it. Although its not enough to quit your job it feels at last somewhat passive than before\n\nAnyone here started something new this year or next year? What worked for you? Share your experiences\n\n",

Some offers pay surprisingly well but the problem is most of them aren't worth your time.\n\nYou'll see a game offer paying $15 and think cool, then realize it takes 20+ hours to hit the required level. That's less than a dollar an hour. Meanwhile there's a finance signup right below it paying $40 that takes 10 minutes. (what the experience actually is like lol)\n\nThere's no easy way to tell the good offers from the bad ones without doing a bunch of research on each one individually. So I built a site that does it for you.\n\nIt's called [offeredge.io](https://offeredge.io). Every offer gets run through a scoring algorithm (the \"OE Score,\" 0 to 100) that factors in:\n\n* Payout vs estimated time to complete\n* How difficult the requirements actually are\n* Whether a deposit or purchase is required (and how much relative to the payout)\n* Offer category (game, finance, app signup, etc.)\n\nHigher score = better use of your time. You can sort by score, payout, speed, or difficulty and filter by device, category, effort level, country, etc.\n\n[Scoring system - an algorithm assigns a score to each offer based off difficulty, time, and payout](https://preview.redd.it/gjej52p1zakg1.png?width=1015&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4febb4e873bfd4ef366135d7951e222b0757222a)\n\nSome stuff the algorithm catches that's easy to miss:\n\n* Game offers where the required level sounds easy but actually takes forever, killing the effective hourly rate\n* Offers that need a deposit bigger than what you even get paid\n* Offers that pay a lot on paper but take so long that you'd make more at McDonald's\n\nIt's a completely free resource. But as a fair disclosure, I do make money through affiliate commissions when you start an offer through the site. It doesn't cost you anything extra and your payouts are the same either way... but I do want to be upfront about that out of respect for this community.",

Too many steps. Too much setup. I’d use them for two weeks and then quit. So I built something simpler.\n\nYou can log expenses using text, voice, or photos. It auto-categorizes and splits shared spending automatically. Think WhatsApp-style logging combined with envelope budgeting.\n\nI’ve had almost no marketing budget. Growth has mostly come from organic Reddit posts, some social media content, and early users sharing it with friends.\n\nIn the last 30 days:  \n• 5,000+ installs  \n• $320 in revenue\n\nIt’s not quit-your-job money. But it’s real. Real subscriptions. Real users requesting features and leaving reviews.\n\nThe app offers a free trial if you want to see how it works. Search **Moneko: Shared Expenses AI** on iOS or Google Play. Early lifetime access is $19.99 for now.\n\nAnd if you have feedback, I’d genuinely love to hear it!!",

KDP handles my soft cover sales and Ingram Spark handles my hardcover (which I make almost no money on).\n\nI sell anywhere from 5-10 books a month regularly. One month, out of nowhere, I sold 48! No idea why. I could definitely sell more if I wrote more books in the series and put some work into it but right now it’s just sitting there until I feel like doing something with it. So far I have not had to talk to a single child (success!).\n\nDid I break even? No idea. Never added anything up. Not passive enough. Probably also can’t answer any questions for you about ROI or whatever. But there it is! Ta da! ",

Not many writers were making money from their writing career back then.\n\nI did well in a lot of marketplaces, but something was lacking.\n\nMarketplaces are good. Free traffic. Paid on time. And so on.\n\nBut the real problem is - no emails. Doesn't feel like I was in business.\n\nI wanted control over what I sell and what kind of ebooks I write.\n\nI started with romance writing because it was popular on Amazon KDP. It's still. But with time, I change. From romance, I shifted to other niches that I enjoyed more. Non-fiction and creating templates.\n\n# Marketplaces - The real Problem\n\nI still love marketplaces.

But for the start, you should stick to one so that your audience dont get confused.\n\nSome niches you can try - health, diet, side hustle, passive income, traveling, food, etc\n\nI would recommend going for micro-niche. Because they are easy to dominate.\n\nexample - instead of choosing a health niche, choose - health after pregnancy, keto diet, paleo diet, etc.\n\nGo deeper for your niche.\n\n**2) Find a traffic source**\n\nI mostly choose writing platforms (Reddit, X, threads, etc.). You choose the platform as per your interest.\n\nIf you like Video making, then -&gt; YouTube, Instagram\n\nFor static images - Instagram, Pinterest\n\nFor writing - Reddit, X, Threads\n\n*Choose what format you love spending time on.*\n\n**3) Create contents**\n\nDon't use Ai. I repeat. Do not use AI.\n\nPlatforms dont like it at all!\n\nThe audience can see it.\n\n*So create content yourself.*\n\nDont worry if you dont know what to create. See what your competitors are creating.\n\nFollow a few creators in your niche. Then see what type of content they are creating currently.\n\nCopy the format. And create something new.\n\n**4) Make ONE product -**\n\nDo this after you have some followers. My target is always the first 1000 followers.\n\nThen *make only ONE product.* It can be any. Depends on your audience. Use it as a test product.\n\nPrice range should be - $7 to $25\n\nDont go beyond this. because it's really hard to sell with a small audience.\n\nYou can improve the product and increase the price later.  \n**5) Capture emails -**\n\nEmails are necessary. This was the reason why I left marketplaces. I was not allowed to link my newsletter there. So collect emails. Use platforms that allow you to send emails.\n\n*You can use this to send high-ticket products later*.  \n**6) Expand to other platforms -**\n\nNow, after being on a platform for a very long time, I have often seen that there comes a time when we need to go beyond it.\n\nI see Instagram and TikTok going on YouTube.\n\nBloggers are using Pinterest and Reddit to expand their reach, and so on.\n\nThis way you get more eyes on your content.\n\n# Why small digital products work better?\n\nYou consider any digital product -\n\n\\-&gt; Templates\n\n\\-&gt; ebooks\n\n\\-&gt; audiobooks\n\n\\-&gt; Videos\n\nWhen you are starting out, you first need to validate the product. If a particular product is working well for others doesn't mean it will work for you as well.\n\nSo in order to find what my audience need I always come up with smaller ones.\n\nAnd if I see people are leaving good feedback, I improve and increase the price for it.\n\nPlus, they are actually very easy to sell.\n\n# My Tech Stack For Digital Product Business\n\nI always thought that starting an online business means I need atleats $1000 in my pocket. But with the digital product business, I was wrong.\n\nI always recommend first earning and only then investing. And still follow the same strategy.\n\nThis is what my current stack looks like -\n\nFor **writing** \\-&gt; Google Docs -&gt; $0\n\nFor **formatting** \\-&gt; Calibre -&gt; $0\n\nFor **traffic** \\-&gt; Social media -&gt; $0 (no ads for the past 10 years! You read it right!)\n\nFor **selling products** \\- Gumroad/Patreon (I also have Payhip and Lemonsqueezy, but for new niches I started a few months ago)\n\nFor **emails** \\- Gumroad/Patreon -&gt; $0\n\n# Some advice to a newbie in the Digital Product Business\n\n1. Every niche is profitable. So pick what you personally love\n2. Reach first $1000 is very hard. So be patient\n3. Once sales come in consistently, dont go lazy (I did that and lost a lot of sales!)\n4. Ask when needed. Reddit is the best platform so far. You have aproblem? Simply ask!\n\nI think I have covered enough here. If you still question comment and, I'll try my best to answer them.\n\nGood luck!",

Building a content site or YouTube channel during those 1 to 2 hours could compound over time. Takes months before it pays anything but once it's rolling the income is fairly passive.

Learn one high-income skill.\nPick ONE brother \n\n\t•\tVideo editing\n\t•\tGraphic design\n\t•\tCopywriting\n\t•\tSocial media management\n\t•\tCoding\n\nYou can learn all of these free on YouTube. Give it 3–6 months of focused practice and you can start charging.\n\n2. Offer services locally.\nPeople overcomplicate making money.\n\n\t•\tCut grass\n\t•\tWash cars\n\t•\tFlip snacks at school\n\t•\tEdit TikToks for small creators\n\t•\tDesign flyers for small businesses\n\nSimple work = no work.\n\n3. Flip things.\nGo on Facebook Marketplace or local groups. Look for underpriced items. Clean them up. Resell. Even $10–$20 profit per flip adds up fast.\n\n4. Avoid these traps\n\n\t•\t“Get rich quick” courses\n\t•\tCrypto gambling\n\t•\tDropshipping without money\n\t•\tRandom online surveys expecting big cash\n\nAt your age, your biggest advantage is TIME. If you spend the next 2–3 years stacking skills instead of chasing fast money, you’ll be ahead of 95% of people by 18.\n\nOne more thing don’t feel pressure to be rich right now.

      "selftext": "After months of searching, I finally received a job offer that works well for me financially. The company also offers many additional benefits and has interesting projects. After I accepted the offer, the HR manager told me that they use a Time Doctor to track the activity.\n\nNormally, I take full responsibility for honestly working all 8 hours, and I have previously experienced micromanagement with excessive control from a toxic manager. Because of that, being tracked with a software seems not so bad for me.\n\nThe issue is that I will be working in regulatory affairs, which involves a lot of research, reading, and reviewing documents. I understand that there is an idle time, and for example, if you are actively reading and thinking for 3–5 minutes, Time Doctor may consider that idle time. It also seems that you cannot use the bathroom or take a short break between tasks to think, because it generates idle time.\n\nI would like to hear about the experiences of other remote workers who use Time Doctor. Do you have problems with idle time due to research or reading tasks?\n\nSome of you might say that I should have refused a job that uses a time tracker, as it could be a red flag that the company does not trust its employees. But to be honest, the job market is insane. It took me 4 months to find this job, and I feel I have nothing to lose. If I am not satisfied with the workplace, I will simply continue searching for another job.\n\nThank you in advance.",

I have 10 years of experience in Operations and Administration, but unfortunately I couldn’t secure a solid opportunity in my field at the time. So I decided to join Concentrix as a Customer Service Agent.\n\nHonestly, it was one of the worst professional experiences I’ve had.\n\nFrom day one of training, there were constant technical issues. Every single day someone had system problems. Instead of handling the situation calmly and professionally, the trainer would panic and get frustrated. When you’re onboarding new employees, technology should be the first thing properly set up. That never happened.\n\nOn top of that, the trainer’s communication skills were extremely poor. Her English proficiency and training method made it very difficult to understand the material. I’ve worked as a trainer before, so it was especially frustrating to see such low-quality delivery. Whenever someone asked a question, she would laugh and say, “I’m learning along with you guys.” That response raised a serious concern, if you’re still learning, why are you training a whole batch?\n\nOnce we moved to production, things got worse. We were essentially left on our own to handle calls. There were no proper team meetings, no real-time support, and no structured guidance. We were expected to document detailed case summaries in Salesforce while actively handling customer calls. If we needed supervisor approval, we had to message on Salesforce Chatter and wait 10–15 minutes for a response , all while the customer was on hold. We weren’t allowed to answer certain questions without supervisor confirmation. Many customers understandably got frustrated and took it out on us.\n\nAnother issue was the supervisor culture. My supervisor would act supportive during one-on-one calls, speaking as if he was protecting and guiding me. Of course I made minor mistakes in the beginning, it was a new role and a new system. That’s normal. However, I later saw emails where he pointed out every small mistake I made and CC’d multiple managers. It felt performative and political rather than genuinely supportive.\n\nEventually, I was terminated within three months for sharing my supervisor’s work email with a customer and they cited silly reasons that many of your cases were open . Yes Sir they weee open because the issues were not resolved from your team’s side.\n\nYes, I acknowledge that it was a mistake. But I strongly believe this was a failure of training and support. We were not properly prepared for high-escalation situations. There was no structured guidance on handling legal threats, refusals to cooperate, or customers demanding direct escalation.\n\nThe environment lacked proper training, operational readiness, and leadership support. There is much more I could say, but this post is already long.\n\nI would simply urge anyone considering joining to carefully evaluate their options.",

Those experiences taught me a lot about operations, planning, client management, and the realities of building a business.\n\nI’m now exploring online work paths that match these skills. I’m comfortable with computers, Excel, workflow organization, and supporting teams. I’m also open to using my entrepreneurial background to help early‑stage founders or small teams as a remote consultant or coordinator.\n\nFor people who’ve transitioned into online work without formal credentials, what roles or platforms would you recommend exploring?",

      "selftext": "This is going to sound weird but I need to figure out if there's actually something here or if I just stumbled into the weirdest traffic source that converts at basically nothing.\n\nStarted a site last July about restoring old photographs. Not like a service, just guides and tutorials. How to fix water damage, remove scratches, colorize black and white photos, that kind of stuff. Basic affiliate setup linking to Photoshop alternatives and scanning equipment.\n\nFirst three months nothing happened. Maybe 200 visitors total. Spent the first month targeting stuff like \"best photo editing software\" and ranking on page 7 behind every tech blog that's ever existed. Gave up on that pretty quick.\n\nAround November I started writing these posts about specific types of damage. Like \"how to restore photos with mold damage\" or \"fix photos stuck to glass frames.\" More specific, less competition. Traffic started coming in. Hit about 1,100 visitors a day by December.\n\nThen something strange happened in January.\n\nI wrote this post about restoring Victorian era photographs because I had some examples from my girlfriend's grandmother's attic. Included a bunch of photos from the 1880s and 1890s. Put the names in the image alt text because I thought that's what you're supposed to do for accessibility or whatever.\n\nPost ranked fine. Nothing special. Then I started noticing weird searches in Search Console.\n\nTook me almost a week to figure out what was happening. I kept seeing traffic for \"Margaret Whitmore 1887\" and \"James Whitmore obituary\" and \"Whitmore family tree.\" Thought maybe there was some historical figure I'd never heard of. Googled them. Nothing. Just random dead people whose photos I'd used as examples.\n\nPeople were googling their dead relatives and finding my post because I had used their names in the image descriptions.\n\nNow about 40% of my traffic is people searching for specific names of people who died between 1850 and 1920. I'm ranking for hundreds of dead people's names. Sometimes I'm position 2 or 3 above actual genealogy sites. My top keyword used to be \"remove scratches from photos.\" Now it's \"James Whitmore 1889 obituary.\" I don't even have an obituary on my site.\n\nTraffic is up to 2,800 visitors a day. But my conversion rate tanked. Went from 3.1% in December to 1.4% now. Because people aren't looking for photo restoration services, they're looking for information about their great great grandfather.\n\nRevenue is basically the same as December even though traffic doubled. Made $1,840 in December, made $1,920 in January. Affiliate clicks are down. Time on page is up from 2 minutes to almost 6 minutes but nobody's buying anything.\n\nI get emails now. Maybe 10-15 a week. People asking if I have more information about their relatives. Asking if I know where the photos came from. One person offered me $200 for a high resolution scan of a photo that was in my post. I didn't even own the photo, it was from my girlfriend's family.\n\nOne person asked if I could \"sense\" anything about their great grandmother because I had her photo on my site. Like if I could feel her presence or something. They weren't joking. Offered me $50 to \"connect\" with her. I'm a blogger, not a medium.\n\nMy girlfriend's mom found the post in January and called at 11pm. I could hear her through the phone from across the room. Something about disrespecting the dead and exploiting family history. These people died in 1883. I don't think they care about my blog. Took the photos down anyway. Traffic from those specific names dropped immediately.\n\nStarted testing this with other posts. Wrote about restoring Civil War era photos, used names from Union soldier records that are public domain. Same thing happened. Now I'm ranking for like 30 soldiers' names. Getting emails from people asking about their great great great grandfather who fought in Virginia.\n\nI have no information to give these people. I just used the photos as examples. But they keep emailing.\n\nTried monetizing this differently in February. Added a section to those posts saying \"looking for more information about your ancestor? Try [Ancestry.com](http://Ancestry.com)\" with an affiliate link. Conversion rate went up to 2.1%. Made $2,340 so far this month.\n\nBut the emails are getting more intense. Someone asked if I could help them find their grandfather's grave. Someone else asked if I had any letters or documents. One person accused me of stealing photos from their family and said they'd report me to I don't even know what. The internet police? The photos are from the Library of Congress.\n\nAll the photos I use now are public domain or from my girlfriend's family with permission. But people don't care. They see a photo of someone with their last name from 1890 and assume I have some connection to their family history.\n\nI'm spending maybe 6 hours a week just responding to emails telling people I don't have any additional information. Another 10 hours writing new posts. So I'm spending 16 hours a week total, making $2,300 a month. That's like $35 an hour before taxes. I could literally make more doing photo editing gigs on Fiverr and not deal with angry emails about dead people.\n\nAlso my girlfriend wants me to stop using any photos that could be traced to real people. Which I get. But that's literally the entire traffic source now. If I switch to generic stock photos or illustrations the traffic will die.\n\nTried writing posts about photo restoration without using specific names. Just \"Victorian era photo restoration techniques\" with example images labeled \"Unknown woman circa 1885.\" Those posts get maybe 50 visitors a month. Nobody searches for that.\n\nThe traffic only comes when I use real names of real dead people.\n\nI looked into this and apparently it's legal because they've been dead for over 100 years and everything's public domain. But legal doesn't mean it feels right. I'm basically using dead people for SEO.\n\nSome of the emails are actually nice though. People thanking me for preserving the photos. People saying they've been searching for images of their ancestor for years. One person said my post was the only photo they'd ever seen of their great grandmother. That made me feel less terrible about the whole thing.\n\nBut I can't scale this. I can't hire someone to respond to emails about dead people's family histories. I can't outsource writing posts about specific individuals because you need to actually research them to write anything meaningful.\n\nAnd I don't want to research them. I just wanted to write about photo restoration.\n\nTraffic is growing. I'm at 3,100 visitors a day now. Revenue is growing slowly. Yesterday I ranked number 1 for someone's name and got an email from their living grandson asking if I was related to them. No dude. I just have a photo of your dead grandpa on my blog.\n\nBut I'm stuck in this weird niche where I'm accidentally running a genealogy resource site when I was trying to run an affiliate site about photo editing software.\n\nI don't know if I should lean into this or try to pivot back to the original plan. Leaning in means more emails, more research, more dealing with people's emotional family stuff. Pivoting back means losing most of my traffic.\n\nAlso tried adding a FAQ to those posts saying \"I don't have additional information about individuals in these photos.\" Doesn't help. People email anyway.\n\nThe restoration work itself is easy. Photoshop for most of it. Tried making some before and after comparison videos with APOB for a few posts back in December but nobody watched them so I stopped. That's not really the problem anyway.\n\nThe problem is I built something I didn't mean to build and now I don't know what to do with it.\n\nAnyone else end up ranking for something completely random? Do you follow the traffic or just start over?",

It makes sense for people to contact you about them, as you wrote down the person's exact name.

Not your niche.\n\nOne option for you to consider: a general page with examples and links to more resources. Add a link to an email address that they can contact you at... but use an autoresponder for that email address. One that points to the resources on the page and add a couple juicy ones that make it seem that the page isn't just a copy. And add a link at the bottom for purchasing a retouched image. \n\nLastly, is there any particular reason you HAVE to reply? Other than courtesy? Could you add an AI bot to screen emailers? Or just reply with the excuse: \"I'm sorry but due to sheer volume of email, I'm currently unable to reply to requests for more personal  information.\" \n\nAre emails part of your funnel for earnings?

      "selftext": "\n\nBeen looking at a lot of deal flow over the past 6-8 months and theres a pattern I keep noticing that I think is worth talking about. Not every type of online business is trending the same direction valuation-wise. Some categories are compressing, some are flat, and a few are quietly getting more expensive to acquire. I wanted to break down the three I keep seeing come up.\n\n\n\nFirst one is vertical SaaS for non-tech industries. Think software built for plumbers, dentists, property managers, small logistics companies. These industries are digitizing but they're doing it slowly and with very few options. Which means when someone builds a tool that actually works for, say, a regional plumbing company to manage scheduling and invoicing... that customer is not leaving. Ever. They're not browsing G2 on weekends looking for alternatives. They found something, it works, their admin person learned it, and thats that.\n\n\n\nI've seen vertical SaaS tools with pretty modest MRR, like $15-30k range, get competing offers because acquirers understand that the switching costs are massive and the TAM is still expanding. These industries haven't even scratched the surface of software adoption. Monthly churn on some of these is sub-2%, sometimes closer to 1.1-1.4%. Multiples are creeping up because buyers are pricing in the retention and the runway, not just current revenue.\n\n\n\nSecond category is one I find genuinely interesting. Productized services that are converting into software. So imagine a company that started doing manual SEO audits as a done-for-you service. Charging $500-800 per audit, doing maybe 40-60 a month. Then they build a tool that automates like 80% of the audit process. Now they've got proven demand (people already pay for this), improving margins because delivery is getting cheaper, and a path toward full SaaS economics.\n\n\n\nThese are fascinating from a buyer perspective because you're not guessing whether people want the thing. You already know they do. You're just watching the margin structure improve over time. I looked at one of these last year where gross margins went from 41% to 68% over 14 months just from automating parts of their fulfillment. The revenue barely changed but the business got dramatically more valuable.\n\n\n\nThird is micro-SaaS with integration or API plays. Small tools that plug into bigger ecosystems... Shopify apps, Salesforce integrations, Slack bots, tools that are Zapier-native. The thing about these is distribution is partially solved by the platform itself. You're not spending $4k/month on paid acquisition hoping your landing page converts. People find you in the app store while they're already looking for a solution.\n\n\n\nAnd once your tool is embedded in someone's workflow, the stickiness is insane. I looked at a Shopify app doing $22k MRR that had net revenue retention of like 113% because existing users kept upgrading as their stores grew. The app just grew with them. Churn was there but expansion revenue more than covered it.\n\n\n\nWhat I think is actually driving all three of these trends is the same underlying thing. Buyers are getting smarter about what \"defensible\" actually means. It's not about having a patent or some proprietary algorithm. It's about structural switching costs, embedded workflows, and expanding TAMs in categories where competition is still thin. Those three things together are what's making acquirers pay up.\n\n\n\nIf you're building in one of these categories and wondering whether the market values what you're doing... it probably does more than you think. And if you're not in one of these categories, I'm not saying your business isn't valuable, but it might be worth thinking about whether theres a way to move toward one of these dynamics. The margin structure one especially. I keep seeing sellers underestimate how much a clear trajectory matters to buyers even when the current numbers are mid.\n\n\n\nAnyway just patterns I've been noticing. Could be wrong about where things go from here but the deal data over the last year or so has been pretty consistent on this stuff.",

Your three buckets line up almost 1:1 with that.\n\nOne trick for people not in those categories: add “boring glue” around your product. Turn generic SaaS into “vertical” by baking in industry-specific workflows and integrations (QuickBooks + ServiceTitan style), or wrap a service around it and slowly automate. Even small things like building a native Shopify or HubSpot app can change your multiple.\n\nI’ve used Acquire and BitsForDigits to watch this play out, and Pulse for Reddit has been handy for catching those early “thinking of selling” or “turning this agency into SaaS” posts in niche subs.\n\nDefensibility via switching costs and margin trajectory is what’s getting rewarded right now.",

      "selftext": "Started this site last May. Writing about personal finance stuff, mostly credit cards and budgeting apps. Figured people searching for \"Card A vs Card B\" are probably ready to apply.\n\nFirst five months were dead. Like maybe 150 visitors total by September. I was writing twice a week, following all the SEO advice, but nothing was happening. Started thinking I picked the wrong niche.\n\nOctober things started moving. Traffic went from nothing to around 500 visitors a day. I was checking Google Analytics constantly. November hit 780. By December I was at 950 daily visitors and made $2,100 that month. I remember sitting at my desk just staring at the dashboard because I couldn't believe it was real.\n\nJanuary I made $2,800. Traffic was still around 950 a day, maybe 1,000 on good days. Thought okay this is it, it's going to keep growing.\n\nNow it's February and I'm still at 950 visitors. Revenue is around $2,600 this month so far. It's just stuck there. Traffic isn't growing at all.\n\nI've got 61 posts published. Still doing two per week like I have been. But new posts aren't ranking. My best post is a credit card comparison that ranks number 3 and makes about $740 a month by itself. I've written four more comparison posts trying to copy that success. None of them rank past page 2.\n\nThe posts that already rank are fine. They're not moving up but they're not dropping either. It's like I hit my ceiling.\n\nI started adding comparison tables in January. Like actual side by side breakdowns of fees and rewards. Takes longer to build but I thought it would help. Haven't seen any ranking changes yet. Maybe it's too soon, I don't know.\n\nGot an email list too. Around 620 people now. Growing maybe 25 a week. When I email about a new post I usually get a few signups. Email probably drives 10 or 15 percent of revenue but it's hard to track because people click through and apply later.\n\nConversion rate is around 1.4% which seems okay for finance. Most signups come from the comparison posts where I break down which card is better for specific situations. Takes way longer to write but people seem to trust it more.\n\nTried making some explainer videos in December. Used Canva for graphics and messed around with APOB and a couple other tools to make talking head style videos without showing my face. Made like three videos explaining credit card rewards programs. Got maybe 200 views total on YouTube. Took forever to put together so I gave up on that pretty quick.\n\nTried guest posting in January. Reached out to maybe 30 finance blogs. Got two guest posts published. Saw zero change in rankings.\n\nAlso tried Facebook ads for like two weeks in November. Spent around $240 targeting people interested in credit cards. Got maybe 160 clicks and literally zero applications. Not even one. Thought my tracking was broken but nope, just zero conversions. Stopped that immediately.\n\nTried Twitter too. Posted tips and linked to my posts for like three weeks. Got maybe 80 followers and like 20 clicks total. Waste of time.\n\nI post on Reddit sometimes in personal finance subs when I can actually help without being promotional. Drives maybe 100 visitors a month but most of them bounce anyway.\n\nUsing Ahrefs for keywords. $99 a month which sucks.\n\nWhat's frustrating is I don't know what changed. Traffic was growing every month from October to December. Then it stopped. I'm doing the same stuff. Same quality, same keywords, same everything.\n\nAlso seeing bigger sites like NerdWallet and The Points Guy covering the same cards I write about. They have way more authority so I'm probably screwed competing with them. Trying to find more specific angles like \"best credit cards for small business owners under 30\" but those get barely any searches.\n\nSpending maybe 18 hours a week on this. Writing takes forever when you have to research all the terms and conditions.\n\nTraffic is flat. Revenue is basically flat. New posts aren't ranking.\n\nDid Google change something in December or January? I keep seeing people talk about algorithm updates but I can't tell if I got hit.\n\nAnyone else stuck like this? I keep going back and forth on whether I should just keep doing what I'm doing or try something completely different. But I don't even know what different would look like. Like should I stop writing new posts and just update the ones that already rank? Should I try to get more backlinks even though guest posting didn't work? Should I just wait it out?\n\nI don't know. Some days I think I just need to be patient. Other days I think I'm wasting my time.",

Phones ringing, customers waiting, technicians asking questions, managers chasing numbers.\n\nOne of my targets was selling service plans.  \nMost advisors sold around 6 a month.  \nThe good ones hit 10–12.\n\nI’d been teaching myself software development in my spare time, so I built a tiny program to help me send personalised service plan emails at scale. Nothing fancy, just something to save time and make sure no customer slipped through the cracks.\n\nMy service plan sales jumped to 45–60 a month.\n\nSame dealership. Same customers. Same targets.  \nJust better process.\n\nLater I moved into sales and saw the exact same problems:\n\nLeads not being nurtured\n\nTest drives not followed up\n\nRenewals forgotten\n\nUpsells inconsistent\n\nRetention basically non-existent\n\nSo I kept building.\n\nFast forward three years and that little tool has evolved into a full platform that automates all the follow-ups dealerships never have time for. Sales, service, MOTs, renewals, birthdays, everything.\n\nI’m not here to promote anything, I just wanted to share the journey because it still feels surreal that something I built to boost my own commission turned into a real product.\n\nIf anyone’s interested in the process, the tech, the dealership side, or the lessons learned, I’m happy to share.",

      "selftext": "Cold calling isn't dead. Bad cold calling is dead. I tracked every call this month and the data tells a clear story.\n\nOut of 820 dials, I got 124 connects which is about 16 percent connect rate. Of those connects, 32 turned into real conversations over 3 minutes. And 12 of those became booked meetings.\n\nThe math breaks down to roughly 72 calls per meeting. Not amazing, but profitable when your deal size is right.\n\nHere's what I learned about openers this month. I tested three different approaches across roughly equal call volumes. The pattern interrupt opener where I said something unexpected like \"Hey this is a cold call, you can hang up but give me 18 seconds first\" got 30 percent to stay on the line past 30 seconds. The permission-based opener where I asked \"Did I catch you at a bad time\" got 22 percent. The direct pitch where I immediately explained why I was calling got only 14 percent.\n\nThe pattern interrupt felt awkward at first but the data was clear. People appreciate honesty about what's happening.\n\nOn timing, I found that Tuesday through Thursday between 10 AM and 11:30 AM had the highest connect rates at 19 percent. Monday mornings were brutal at 9 percent. Friday afternoons were dead at 5 percent. I stopped calling Fridays after lunch entirely.\n\nThe biggest insight was about follow-up after missed calls. I left 310 voicemails. Got 7 callbacks. That's barely 1 percent. But when I stopped leaving voicemails and instead sent a quick LinkedIn message within 5 minutes of the missed call, I got 22 responses from 156 attempts. That's 14 percent. The multi-touch approach crushed voicemail-only.\n\nMy current approach is to call, if no answer send immediate LinkedIn connection with a note referencing the call, then follow up with email the next day. This three-channel approach within 24 hours gets way better results than any single channel alone.\n\nThe psychology behind why this works is simple. People are busy. They miss calls all the time. But when they see the same person tried to reach them through multiple channels, it signals importance. It also creates familiarity. By the time they see your email, they've already seen your name twice.\n\nThe reps on my team who adopted this approach saw their meeting rates increase by 37 percent within the first month. The ones who stuck to single-channel calling stayed flat.\n\nCold calling works but it's not about the call anymore. It's about how the call fits into a larger sequence. The phone is the start of the conversation, not the whole thing.\n\nIf you're still measuring success by calls made, you're missing the point. Measure conversations started across all channels. That's what actually predicts revenue.",

          "body": "Cold calls can work and likely will until AI filters them out for good in the near future. But even now, cold calls arent highly effective (as tracked close rate percentages always demonstrate) and they will never not be abrasive. I think they key to using calls to generate business requires a clever and effective sales/marketing hybrid approach that qualifies leads and generates consultative, warm-calls. The more of these your firm generates, the more calls your sales team can make. More criticaly, instead of knowing nothing about them, salespeople can act as a guide (and a catalyst) towards finding solutions your firm offers that help with your prospect's challenges. \n\nThe corporate avg is typically stated that around 5% of cold calls generate revenue (or so my last couple employers used to state) Thus, old school mentality was to get your sales to call, call, call!! To me, that just meant 95% of my time (and later, my team's time) was inefficiently spent. Later, as VP of Sales, I arranged to regularly collaborate with marketing and product to ensure our solutions were getting in front of the right eyes, the product regularly evolved to meet or exceed expectations and our sales team was then getting warm leads to follow up as helpful consultants and not high-pressure closers. Getting the process to a place where it became truly effective took time (about 6mo) with much back and forth. Along the way we discovered roadblocks in all areas, marketing, sales and product which we then tweaked and refined. Ultimately we grew flat sales to +35% (Year 1) and +45% (year 2). \n\nCold calling is a blunt-force approach and DOES have its place in the very early days but, this should rather quickly be evolved around a more strategic business plan to capture new customers and revenue. \n\n",

The margin difference between those two approaches is massive at scale.\n\nAlso, one thing I've seen work well for local service lead gen: once you nail the playbook for one vertical (say pressure washing), the same system usually transfers to adjacent verticals with minimal tweaking. Landscaping, HVAC, roofing. The outreach mechanics are nearly identical, just different keywords and seasonal patterns. That's where the real compounding happens.",

To reach the next level, you need to build a Structure (systems and lead-gen flows) that works even when you take a breath.

You may get some quick wins, but don't be lulled into thinking that's every day. \n2. Surround yourself with people smarter than yourself.  It's the smartest thing you can do. \n3. Practice self-care. Entrepreneurship requires every bit of you. Every single day. (And most nights.) Exercise. Eat well. Meditate. Rest. The basics. But you have to do them better, than most other people, just to keep moving forward. Do not underestimate this. \n\nP.S. I did spend a few years working for other companies. But they simply taught me what I did not want to do. \n\nWhat would you add to this list?\n\n \n\n ",

But the businesses that actually scaled were the ones where I stepped back and asked \"how can I make this repeatable without me?\"\n\nDocumenting processes felt like a waste of time when I was busy. But once I had systems in place, I could delegate, I could take a real vacation, and honestly the business ran better without me micromanaging every detail.\n\nThe other thing I'd add: Get comfortable with saying no. Every opportunity looks good when you're hungry. But chasing every shiny object dilutes your focus and burns your energy. Learning to say \"that's interesting but it's not aligned with where I'm going\" was a game changer.\n\nCurious what your thoughts are on delegation vs doing it yourself.

The client buying the refresh has an immediate problem; the one for your full strategy package needs to be nurtured first. One thing worth doing: track which refresh clients eventually come back for the larger engagement. In my experience roughly 15-20% do, which means your boring offer is also your best lead qualification tool. Lean into it, raise prices incrementally, and let the premium package remain aspirational.",

The market is telling you exactly what it wants, and the fact that you're conflicted about it is completely normal.\n\nWe see this pattern constantly at our dev shop. Founders come in wanting to build the complex, sophisticated version of their product. Then we help them ship a simpler v1 first, and that simpler thing ends up being the actual business. The premium offering becomes the upsell, not the entry point.\n\nWhat I'd suggest: don't abandon the full brand strategy work. Instead, use the refresh package as your front door. Deliver it well, build trust, and then naturally transition those clients into the deeper engagement when they're ready. You've accidentally built a perfect sales funnel. The boring package reduces risk for the buyer, proves your competence, and creates a relationship where the bigger commitment feels safe.\n\nThe founders who struggle are the ones who fight the market instead of listening to it. You're listening. Now lean in.",

Going from 0 to 1 is harder than going from 100 to 1000.

And most people do it completely wrong.\n\nI've been looking at what actually drives leads for service businesses like coaches, consultants, agencies... and the difference between accounts that get inbound and accounts that get nothing is almost always the same thing. It's not follower count. It's just consistency, and having an actual point of view.\n\nThe people generating real pipeline aren't the ones with 10k followers. They're the ones posting 3-4x a week with very specific content for a very specific audience. Not \"tips for entrepreneurs\" but like \"why retainer clients are a trap for new coaches\" kind of stuff. Opinionated, polarizing a little bit.\n\nThe algorithm right now rewards niche authority way more than broad reach and most people haven't figured that out yet.\n\nCombine that with Reddit and you've got a pretty underrated combo honestly.

Not traditional SEO, but making sure your brand shows up when people ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini questions in your space.\n\nMost entrepreneurs are still fighting over Google page one while a growing chunk of their audience is getting answers from AI tools instead. The playbook is different too. It's less about keywords and backlinks, more about being the authoritative source that AI models pull from. That means detailed, well-structured content that actually answers specific questions in your niche.\n\nWe noticed this shift when we started tracking where our inbound leads were coming from. A surprising number said they found us through an AI assistant recommendation, not a Google search. Once we started creating content specifically designed to be cited by LLMs, the organic traffic from that channel grew faster than anything we were doing on traditional search.\n\nThe other one I'd add is community-led content on niche platforms. Not posting your own stuff, but genuinely participating in conversations where your customers already hang out.

You upload your PDF or content and it turns into something you can scroll through like a digital brochure, track views, share with clients after the call, etc. Feels more like sending them a polished proposal than “here’s my slide deck”.  \n  \nA lot of people I know mix tools now.

The instinct is to keep hiring people who do the core work, but what actually unlocks your time is hiring someone whose entire job is managing the people stuff. Scheduling, time off, shift coverage, onboarding. All of it.\n\nThe math is simple: if you're spending 15-20 hours a week on employee management instead of growth activities, an ops manager at 50-60K pays for themselves almost immediately through the revenue you can now generate with that recovered time.\n\nShort term fix while you hire: give your most reliable employee at each location scheduling authority.

I firgured they needed accountability. So, I had them send daily 5 minute report of what they were working, what’s their focus for the day, and what were they stuck or off track. Plus I needed them to start organizing their shifts themselves.\n\nThe second thing was that I end up hiring a remote virtual assistant in Latam through a company that GPT recommended. This staffing agency was called Hire With Near. It was game changing. Yep it cost me a bit at first but it was totally worth it. Instead of spending 60-70k having someone on-site or remote in the US this VA from Mexico was around ~20k a year.  But beyond saving time an each week I had most of the admin stuff handled.

Put yourself around founders doing bigger numbers. Attend events. Join paid communities. Work with higher level clients. Travel while still running your business. You do not need a campus to expand your thinking. And those travel build programs can be interesting, but only if they genuinely raise your standards and connect you with serious operators.

You're doing neither. You already named your actual gap: no network beyond clients, no exposure beyond your niche, limited worldview. That's a more honest self-assessment than most people twice your age ever make.\n\nHere's what I'd sit with. The question isn't \"college or no college.\" It's \"what kind of growth do I need right now?\" You've proven you can execute. You can build, sell, deliver. That's real and you should be proud of it. But execution without perspective narrows over time. You get better and better at the thing you already know, and your world gets smaller while your revenue gets bigger. That's a trap disguised as progress.\n\nCollege, at its best, isn't about learning business theory. It's about being forced to think across disciplines you would never choose on your own. Philosophy, history, psychology, ethics. The stuff that doesn't feel useful until ten years later when you're making decisions that require more than tactical skill. It broadens the foundation you build everything else on.\n\nThat said, a traditional four-year degree isn't the only way to get that. Those travel programs you mentioned sound closer to what you actually need: real exposure, real building, real worldview expansion. The test for any option isn't \"will this give me a credential.\" It's \"will this make me think differently about what I'm already doing.\"\n\nYou don't need a backup plan. You need a wider lens. How you get it matters less than whether you're honest about needing it. And at 19, the fact that you already see that puts you ahead of where most people start",

And the mom of the lead singer girl made her go to college,  first, and then revisit her music career. They *never* got back to where they were before she dropped it to go to college. \n\nI think my point is, if you're building, and it is still in the early stages, see if you can get that degree now. And go for one that actually helps you with your business/niche. \nIf you've done a lot of building, and it has (starter to) really take off, don't just drop your business.  \n\nAnd there's lots of space between 'dropping the business and going 100% for the degree' and 'focusing 100% in your business and NOT getting a degree at all'.",

I'd probably start with cold email outreach for B2B companies since the demand is insane and you can charge $2-5k/month per client pretty fast. Something I'm building called Brew actually came from this exact problem - spending way too much time crafting emails when I should've been focusing on strategy and client results.

          "body": "If I had to restart in 2026 with no money and no network, I wouldn’t touch SaaS or some fancy AI tool first. I’d go straight for cash flow. Service first, ego later. Something boring that solves a real problem and people already pay for. Local lead gen, short form content for businesses, email marketing for small ecom brands, that kind of thing. You do not need capital for that, just skill and relentless outreach.\n\nEveryone wants leverage before they’ve earned it. Leverage comes after you can consistently sell. So step one would be learn how to sell. Cold outreach, follow ups, handling objections, closing on Zoom. It’s uncomfortable but that’s where the money is. You can make 3k to 5k per month way faster with a service than trying to build the next big SaaS from zero. I’ve seen people burn 12 months building something nobody asked for. Painful.\n\nThen once cash flow is stable, I’d build distribution. Newsletter, Twitter, maybe YouTube. Not for ego, but to own attention. Attention compounds. You post consistently for a year and suddenly doors open. Weird how that works. It’s boring at first. Feels like shouting into the void. But that’s the tax.\n\nSo yeah. Service for cash. Sales skill for survival. Distribution for leverage. Then product later when you actually understand the market.\n\nIf you’re into building real wealth from zero and not just dreaming about it, I write about that journey weekly in Wealth Rewired. It’s all practical stuff, no guru nonsense.",

Actually talking to 50 people who run small businesses or SaaS companies and asking \"what is the most painful repetitive thing you do every week?\"\n\nThe answer in 2026 almost certainly involves AI automation. But not the way most people think. It is not \"build another AI wrapper.\" It is \"find a 500 dollar per month manual process and automate 80 percent of it with existing AI tools.\" Sell that as a service before you build a product.\n\nBiggest advantage of starting from zero in 2026 vs 2020: the cost to build has dropped 10x. A SaaS that took 50k and 6 months can now ship for under 500 dollars in a few weeks. But that also means competition is brutal, so distribution matters more than ever.\n\nFastest path: skill leads to income leads to problem discovery leads to service leads to productize.

      "selftext": "Solo founder here. Built a PDF editor over the past year. Just hit 10k downloads with zero marketing spend.\n\n\n\nNot a unicorn story - making \\~$500/month - but wanted to share what actually worked vs what I thought would work.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nTHE PRODUCT\n\n\n\nPDF editor that's:\n\n\\- 20MB (vs Adobe's 300MB)\n\n\\- Works completely offline\n\n\\- No signup/cloud required\n\n\\- Free on desktop, small one-time payment on mobile\n\n\n\nBuilt it because I was tired of bloated PDF tools that force everything through the cloud.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT I THOUGHT WOULD WORK (Spoiler: Didn't)\n\n\n\nProduct Hunt Launch: Ranked #284\n\n\\- Spent 2 weeks preparing\n\n\\- Got 50 upvotes\n\n\\- \\~200 visits\n\n\\- 12 downloads\n\n\\- Felt like a complete failure\n\n\n\nHackerNews (First Attempt): 11 points, 0 comments\n\n\\- Posted at wrong time\n\n\\- Didn't engage in comments fast enough\n\n\\- Buried in /new within an hour\n\n\n\nMy Own X/Twitter: 3-4 likes per post\n\n\\- Tweeted about launches\n\n\\- Crickets\n\n\\- My followers don't care about my product (harsh truth)\n\n\n\nPaid Ads: Didn't even try\n\n\\- No budget as bootstrapped founder\n\n\\- Heard horror stories about burning money\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT ACTUALLY WORKED\n\n\n\n1. SOMEONE ELSE'S TWEET (1,900 likes)\n\n\n\nA random user tweeted about my product. I had nothing to do with it.\n\n\n\nMy tweets: 4 likes\n\nRandom user's tweet: 1,900 likes\n\n\n\nSame product. Different messenger.\n\n\n\nLesson: You can't make your product go viral. But you can make a product so good that others want to share it.\n\n\n\n2. GERMAN TECH BLOG (3,500 downloads)\n\n\n\nA respected German tech blog found my product organically and wrote about it.\n\n\n\nI didn't pitch them. They found it.\n\n\n\nTheir angle: \"No cloud requirement\"\n\n\n\nTurns out, Germans are extremely privacy-conscious (GDPR is a mindset, not just compliance).\n\n\n\nResult: Traffic exploded overnight. 40% of my users are now from Germany, Austria, Switzerland.\n\n\n\nLesson: Build with strong principles. The right market will find you - even if it's across the world and you didn't target them.\n\n\n\n3. SOFTWARE DIRECTORIES (\\~1,000 downloads)\n\n\n\nGot listed on:\n\n\\- AlternativeTo\n\n\\- Softonic\n\n\\- AppBrain\n\n\n\nDidn't pay for featured placement. Users added my product themselves.\n\n\n\nWhen people search \"Adobe alternative\" or \"lightweight PDF editor\" - they find these directories first, not my website.\n\n\n\nResult: Steady stream of 50-100 downloads per day just from directories.\n\n\n\nLesson: SEO isn't just Google. Be discoverable where your users are searching.\n\n\n\n4. REDDIT (Organic Comments) (\\~2,200 downloads)\n\n\n\nNot posting \"Check out my product!\"\n\n\n\nJust being helpful in r/productivity, r/software threads where people ask \"What PDF editor do you use?\"\n\n\n\nI'd share my experience, mention alternatives including mine, and let them decide.\n\n\n\nResult: People checked it out because I was helpful first, promotional never.\n\n\n\nLesson: Distribution = being present where your users have problems. Not announcing where you want attention.\n\n\n\n5. WORD OF MOUTH (\\~1,000 downloads)\n\n\n\nThe unsexy one that compounds:\n\n\\- Students sharing in college WhatsApp groups\n\n\\- People recommending in forums\n\n\\- Reviews mentioning it\n\n\n\nTakes time but becomes self-sustaining.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nTHE PATTERN I'M SEEING\n\n\n\nDistribution channels I can't control (others' tweets, blogs finding me, directories, word of mouth) &gt;&gt;&gt; channels I can control (my tweets, paid ads, official launches).\n\n\n\nYou can't force organic growth. But solve a real problem well, and people will talk about it.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nCURRENT METRICS (Full Transparency)\n\n\n\nRevenue: \\~$500/month (\\~50 paid users at $10 one-time purchase)\n\nDownloads: 10,000+ total (across all platforms)\n\nTime to build: \\~10 months (nights/weekends while working day job)\n\nMarketing spend: $0\n\nTeam: Just me\n\nFunding: $0 (bootstrapped)\n\n\n\nGeographic breakdown:\n\n\\- 40% Germany/Austria/Switzerland (DACH region)\n\n\\- 35% India\n\n\\- 15% USA\n\n\\- 10% Rest of world\n\n\n\nPlatform breakdown:\n\n\\- 60% Desktop (Windows/Mac/Linux) - completely free\n\n\\- 40% Mobile (iOS/Android) - freemium\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT I'M LEARNING\n\n\n\n1. PRODUCT-MARKET FIT &gt; MARKETING\n\n\n\nUsers market products that solve real problems. You don't need to.\n\n\n\n2. GEOGRAPHIC ARBITRAGE IS REAL\n\n\n\nBiggest market: Germany\n\nMy location: Not Germany\n\nMy German language skills: Zero\n\n\n\nBuilt for global market with strong principles (privacy, offline-first). Germans loved it. Now I'm learning German and translating the app.\n\n\n\nSometimes your product finds its market before you do.\n\n\n\n3. FREEMIUM CAN WORK FOR BOOTSTRAPPED\n\n\n\n10,000 free users = my marketing team\n\n50 paid users = fund development\n\n\n\nFew % conversion isn't impressive, but:\n\n\\- Free users create reviews, mentions, directories\n\n\\- Word of mouth scales\n\n\\- Paid users make it sustainable\n\n\n\nCurrently at $500/month. Goal: $10k/month (need 1,000 paid users).\n\n\n\n4. LAUNCH DAY DOESN'T MATTER\n\n\n\nProduct Hunt flopped. Nobody remembers.\n\nHackerNews flopped. Nobody cares.\n\n\n\n3 months later: 10,000 downloads from sources I didn't plan for.\n\n\n\nGreat products compound. Bad launches don't matter if you keep shipping.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nCHALLENGES I'M FACING\n\n\n\n1. CODE SIGNING ($400/year)\n\n\n\nWindows installer isn't signed. Shows scary warning. Losing downloads because of this.\n\n\n\nCan't afford it yet at $500/month.\n\n\n\n2. CUSTOMER SUPPORT (Just Me)\n\n\n\nHandling 20+ support emails per week alone.\n\n\n\nNeed to automate or hire but can't afford yet.\n\n\n\n3. FEATURE CREEP\n\n\n\nEveryone wants their specific use case: OCR, cloud sync, collaboration.\n\n\n\nStaying focused on \"lightweight offline PDF editor\" is hard when revenue is slow.\n\n\n\n4. IMPOSTOR SYNDROME\n\n\n\n$500/month isn't impressive. Seeing others with $50k+ MRR makes me feel like I'm failing.\n\n\n\nBut have to remember: I started at $0. Progress is progress.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\n\n\nShort term:\n\n\\- Hit $3k/month (need 300 paid users)\n\n\\- Afford code signing certificate\n\n\\- Translate to German (my biggest market)\n\n\n\nLong term:\n\n\\- $10k/month = quit day job\n\n\\- Hire part-time support\n\n\\- Build team of 2-3\n\n\n\nNot trying to be a unicorn. Just trying to build a sustainable business solving a real problem.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nQUESTIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY\n\n\n\n1. How did you find your unexpected market? (Like my Germany discovery)\n\n\n\n2. At what revenue did you quit your day job? (Thinking about this at $3k/month)\n\n\n\n3. Code signing / legal costs - when do you bite the bullet and just pay?\n\n\n\n4. How do you stay motivated when growth is slow but steady?\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about:\n\n\\- Bootstrapping without funding\n\n\\- Building solo\n\n\\- Distribution tactics that worked (and failed)\n\n\\- Pricing strategy\n\n\\- Geographic expansion\n\n\\- Dealing with impostor syndrome\n\n\n\nNot here to sell - genuinely want to learn from this community. You all have been through this before.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading.",

          "body": "@ $10 for a one time purchase, you are going to have to sell a LOT - if you are at 20 support emails pw now, imagine how many you will have if you get to $10K pm - this is the issue with B2C - it doesn't scale. Without code signing, business will not touch your product (they will have policies that would block it). \n\nI would do 3 things right now\n\n1) Code signing - bite the bullet and wear the costs, you are leaving money on the table without it.  \n2) Create excellent documentation, make it easy to find (in app) and search - ie work to keep support emails to a minimum.  \n3) Segment the market - $10 for private, at least $50 for business (they can afford it, and you need to cover your extra overheads).  \n\nJust be prepared for a lot of extra work selling to business - whilst some people can use their credit cards, get ready for dealing with requests for quotes and  purchase orders for $50 which can really suck up your free time (and your will to live).  \n\nGood luck.",

          "body": "The 20MB vs 300MB comparison is doing a lot of heavy lifting here and I love it. That's a genuine product advantage, not a gimmick. One thing I'd add from my experience shipping MVPs for clients: the 'zero marketing spend' framing undersells what you actually did. Community engagement, word of mouth, and showing up in forums IS marketing. It's just not paid marketing. The distinction matters because founders read 'zero budget' and think distribution happens by itself. It doesn't. You clearly put in the work on distribution, just not through ads. That's worth calling out.",

Also working on a desktop app solo and the part about Product Hunt ranking #284 made me laugh because I've been treating PH in my head like it's going to be this big moment. Sounds like it really wasn't for you.\n\nThe niche community thing tracks with what I keep seeing too. The founders who do well seem to find the 2-3 places where people already have the problem, not blast it out to everyone.\n\nQuestion though - at $10 one-time, how are you thinking about the long term math on this? u/finalbuilder brought up the support load thing and that's something I keep going back and forth on. I'm still trying to decide between one-time and subscription for my own app. At $10 per user you'd need a LOT of volume to make it work no?",

Instead of a revenue number, consider: 6 months of runway + consistent growth trend. $3k/month sounds low, but if you're seeing 20%+ month-over-month growth, the math changes fast.\n\nAlso, the code signing issue - that's costing you more than $400/year in lost conversions.

Ask upfront: \"Is there an internal team involved in this project?\" Not confrontational, just standard discovery. Their answer (or dodge) tells you a lot.\n\n  \n2. Replace free demos with paid discovery. Even a small paid phase ($500-1500 depending on scope) filters out everyone who is not serious. Real buyers are happy to pay for it because they get value either way. Time-wasters disappear instantly.\n\n  \n3. If they push back on paid discovery, offer a short presentation or walkthrough of similar past work instead. Never custom-build anything before money changes hands.\n\n  \n4. \"Show us what you can do\" without any commitment from their side = free consulting. A legit client will have a budget, a timeline, and a decision-maker on the call. If any of those three are missing, be cautious.\n\n  \n5. Set a personal rule: no more than 2-3 hours of unpaid work before any engagement. That is enough for a proposal and a rough wireframe, not a full week of building.\n\n  \nThe silver lining is that once you start charging for discovery, the quality of your leads goes way up.

That doesn’t mean walk away immediately, but it does mean no free builds. At most, high-level walkthroughs or concept sketches.\n\nPay attention to how concrete the conversation is. Buyers talk about timelines, budgets, and consequences if something doesn’t get done. Idea collectors talk about possibilities, features, and “what ifs”.\n\nOne simple filter that saves a lot of pain is flipping the ask.

Just 4-5 lines max.\n\n* What we did this week\n* What's in progress\n* Any blockers or things I need from them\n* What's coming next week\n\nThat's it. No fancy dashboard. No Loom video. Just a few lines in WhatsApp or email wherever they prefer.\n\nThe result? Monday inbox chaos dropped by like 70%. Clients stopped \"checking in\" because they already knew what was happening. And the ones who still wanted calls? At least now the calls had context.\n\nSounds basic, but I resisted this for years thinking \"I'll just update them when there's something big to share.\" Turns out clients don't want big updates. They want to feel like things are moving.\n\nAnyone else have a small process change that had an outsized impact on client relationships?",

Right now your landing page exists to tell a story, build trust, handle objections, and nudge someone toward a purchase. But when an agent is doing the shopping, none of that matters. It's just parsing your structured data, comparing you against 50 competitors in seconds, and making a decision based on price, availability, and whatever criteria the human set. All that conversion optimization work becomes invisible to a huge chunk of your traffic. I think we're going to see businesses basically running two parallel experiences whether they realize it or not. The human-facing one with all the emotional triggers and brand storytelling, and the agent-facing one that competes purely on data quality, response speed, and how cleanly you expose your catalog. The interesting thing is that the agent channel actually rewards transparency and punishes the kind of pricing games and dark patterns that work on humans. If your competitor's API returns clean structured pricing and yours requires three clicks and a popup to reveal the real number, the agent just skips you entirely.",

Something original and equally impressive.\n\nWhat actually got things moving was much simpler: I looked at what was already in front of me, the skills I’d built over the years, the people in my network, the questions they kept asking, the small problems I kept seeing.\n\nMy first projects weren’t visionary. They were practical. Someone needed help with a resume. I could help. I charged for it. That was the business, later it grew into a funnel feeder for other part of the business. \n\nIMHO we overestimate ideas and underestimate proximity and simplicity. \n\nIf you’re stuck, I’d say don’t brainstorm but take inventory: \n\nWhat do people already ask me for?\nWhat can I solve this month with what I already know?\n\nI’d tell the younger me just to start there :)",

Not the install-and-forget kind — the recurring service agreements where you inspect systems twice a year and get first-call priority when something breaks.\n\nI work with a lot of trades businesses and the ones printing money aren't chasing big installs. They're the ones sitting on 200-400 maintenance contracts at 15-25/month each. That's 3,000-10,000/month in recurring revenue before a single service call. And maintenance customers convert to equipment replacements at 3-4x the rate of cold leads because you're already their guy when the compressor dies in August.\n\nThe boring part is that it takes 2-3 years to build a meaningful book of contracts. But once you're there, you've essentially built a subscription business with physical lock-in — nobody cancels their AC maintenance in Houston in July. And every house on that route is a potential referral for the neighbor's unit that's making a weird noise.\n\nThe businesses I've seen do this best treat the maintenance visit like a sales call without ever selling anything. The tech checks everything, takes a photo of any wear, and says 'your capacitor is at about 70% — it'll probably last another season but I'd plan on replacing it next spring.' No pressure, just information. The close rate on those follow-ups is insane.",

I asked them for a demo, put all the jobs for the next 3 days in there, and it’s already a different world seeing on one page who ordered what, when, and what route actually makes sense.

Most customers will have no problem waiting a couple of days for a reliable pickup.\n\nSecond, limit the number of places you can be contacted. One text or messaging point of contact and one phone number is plenty. If a customer contacts you through another channel, you can just copy and paste a standard message advising them you only take requests through specific platforms.\n\nThird, immediately put all scheduled pickups into a calendar app and set reminder notifications if needed so you won't forget. If you want to get fancy, you can even have customers book their pickups online and have those bookings go directly into your calendar.\n\nJust because it's a side hustle doesn't mean it can be disorganized.

          "body": "The calls are where you are bleeding the most and probably do not even realize it. When you are on a job site dumping a load, you physically cannot pick up the phone. That person calling you right now is already dialing the next hauler on Google by the time you see the missed call.\n\nTwo things that fix this without adding overhead:\n\n1. Auto text-back on missed calls. Most business phone apps handle this - OpenPhone, Google Voice, even some carrier features. Someone calls, you can not answer, they get an instant text: \"Hey, on a job right now. What do you need hauled and what is your zip?\" Now they are in a conversation with you instead of moving on to your competitor.\n\n2. Stop quoting live over the phone. Send everyone a standard message: \"Shoot me a photo of what needs hauled and your address, I will get you a price within the hour.\" Batch your quoting into 15 minutes at the end of each work block instead of getting pulled out of work constantly.\n\nThe operators I have watched go from one trailer to three did not get there by working harder. They got there by making sure every lead that came in actually converted to a booked job. Right now you are probably losing 40-50% of people who reach out - not because they said no to your price, but because they called someone who picked up.",

Might help with the bigger picture of scaling this thing beyond just you and a trailer. For right now though, get a calendar system locked down.\n\nGoogle Calendar with reminders every 30 minutes before a job would've saved you that landfill trip.

It’s organization.\n\nStep one: stop taking jobs through random channels. Pick one booking method. Either a simple booking form or one business number. Everything funnels there. No scattered WhatsApp threads and phone notes.\n\nStep two: time blocks, not “whenever I can.” Decide your available pickup windows in advance and only offer those. For example, 6–7pm, 7–8pm, Saturday 9–11am, etc. If a slot is full, it’s full. That alone will prevent stacking jobs.\n\nStep three: use a basic scheduling tool or even a shared calendar. Every job gets:  \nClient name  \nAddress  \nDump type  \nLandfill plan  \nPayment status\n\nNo job exists unless it’s on the calendar.\n\nStep four: buffer time. If landfill closes at 5, your last dump run should target 3:30 or 4. You need margin. Side hustle mistakes usually come from overestimating how much fits in a day.\n\nFinally, consider raising prices slightly. When demand exceeds capacity, price is the lever. Fewer jobs at higher margins is better than burnout and missed appointments.\n\nYou don’t need more hustle. You need structure.",

That 10 seconds per pickup is the difference between spotting patterns and just watching chaos happen. Second, as calls start coming in when you're fully booked, resist the urge to take every job. Instead, track which times and days you're getting crushed with inbound calls. That's where your actual demand ceiling is, and it tells you exactly when you need to either raise prices, adjust availability, or make a real hiring decision.\n\n\n\nThird, once you have 30 days of clean data in CurbWaste, run a quick analysis on your actual profit per job versus the time it takes. You might find that three of those four daily jobs are actually worth it, and one isn't. That's the insight that keeps a side hustle from becoming a burnout machine.",

But if you assign some value to your time, if you hired a person at a fair wage to do the hunting for you, then you'd be losing money?\n\nYou are thinking in terms of growth, but before that you might be better off thinking in terms of profitability.\n\n&gt;I really don't want to compromise and start listing basic zara castoffs or buying from those vintage inspired suppliers that are clearly just rebranded fast fashion.\n\nThat might be a path toward profitability but it destroys the edge you have built so far.  You might consider that plan B or plan C.\n\n&gt;Sold within days\n\n&gt;Just to keep a few listings active at a time\n\nwhenever you are selling out of inventory too quickly, the solution is higher prices.  If you are finding 1 or 2 items a week and selling 1 or 2 items a day, then increase your prices.  Raise your prices by 5x and see what happens.  Like don't raise them just a little and continue to have the same problem.  Raise them to the point where they are too expensive.  If you never find what price is too expensive, then it'll be hard to find the sweet spot.\n\n&gt;So for people selling vintage on vinted or similar platforms who've actually figured this out what's your sourcing situation look like? Trying to grow this thing without completely abandoning what made it worth doing in the first place.\n\nyou might have to think about the degree to which this is a for profit enterprise versus a fun hobby that produces a little extra money.  There is no need to grow a fun hobby and if you do it might stop being fun.\n\nIf you get into restorations, that could increase the volume of stock you can find.  If a piece is not in sellable condition but could be restored to sellable condition, if it can be given new life, that can be worth while.",

When you run a small business you wear many hats and sometimes you wear all the hats. \n\nSome people need to look at this before they start a certain type of business because some businesses are more time consuming and labor intensive than others and a multitude of different responsibilities whereas some are only a small amount. \n\nHow long have you been running your business? \nIt's a shame to get burnt out too early but there's always different periods in starting a business. \n\nThere's typically the excitement and early planning and apprehensive phase which can all go together. \nThen, if you get a little bit of business in it smooths out your anxiety a little bit there's just a normal stage or even a building stage. (Most people seem to rush this building stage too much but that's a different discussion).\n\nThen many people stay in the next stage which I call the plug and chug stage for a long time. \nYou can do this for decades. \n\nSome will then go into a growth mentality or phase and others will just stay in the plug and chug maintenance style until they decide to shut down the business, retire, or try to sell it or pass it along to someone else. \n\nEverything you don't do yourself cost you more money and cuts into your profit. \n\nA lot of the small business owners can't stand to pay anybody to do anything and we don't like to pay for anything because we think everything else in the world is a rip-off. \nA lot of these people don't see their own services or products as a rip-off even if they are or even if they're just the going market rate which remember can still be a rip-off. \n\nBut some of them, like myself, will gladly admit if one of our products or services is overpriced or kind of a rip-off but then some of us go so far as to have multiple businesses and make sure the price is stay much lower than the competitive going right because we refuse to be part of the problem. \nUnfortunately there's not many like us today. \n\nSo you either have to become more efficient at doing what you need to do (which is what I did early on so it really wasn't that much work and I seem to have a real knack for getting really good and efficient at doing repetitive things) or you have to sub some things out or find some occasional, part-time or independent contractor style people you can pay to do the things you need done when you need them done. \n\nI have had friends and similar businesses to my own who did this and I used to joke that they were too lazy just to do some of the simple things. \nI have other friends who do absolutely everything themselves but but way too much effort and spend way too much time doing it because it's really not that big of a deal and doesn't have to be that perfect. \n\nSo you have to find a happy medium somewhere that you can live with but I can live with myself and the world a lot better by working a little bit harder and keeping more money in my pocket. \n\nNow for those people who charge a lot more and still maintain plenty of business volume, and are flush with cash, they may not be as motivated to do things themselves. \n\nI'm just such a cheapskate that even if I tripled my profits and income, I would still do things myself. \nIn fact, I would just do less volume so I wouldn't have to do it as much and that's why I wouldn't make three times as much money but maybe at 1.5 or 1.7 I would be happy. \nThis way I wouldn't be doing everything required to make a lot more money but I still wouldn't be paying people.",

It's hard for me to manage everything on my own but it's even harder to delegate cuz I sometimes struggle to let go of control while also not wanting to micromanage someone.\n\nSome stuff was easy to automate like accounting and invoicing, but marketing is a beast. The hardest area for me personally was content creation, especially video content. That was the truly dreadful part. It took so long to make and even then it felt like I could always change just one thing but that led to 10 other things needing changes too.\n\nEventually I slowly started delegating tasks, hired a strategist first who helped me figure out what actually needed my attention versus what could be handed off. With their advice I started looking for content handling services and albeit slowly, this has saved me so much time I couldn't have imagined. Gives me way more time to dedicate to my actual business lol. But even now on some-days it's still a struggle to juggle so many things at once, ig that's part of running a business.",

The finance/numbers side is usually what drains people the most because you can't really ignore it but it also takes forever to understand what's actually happening with your money. One thing that helped me shift perspective: you don't need to do everything yourself, you just need to know enough to make the right call on what to delegate or automate first.\n\nMost founders I know start with the stuff that either takes the most time or causes the most anxiety. Usually financial clarity is up there becuase bad decisions compound fast when you're guessing. If the accounting/CFO side is eating at you, came across AsteroCFO .Ai recently which gives you AI-powered financial analysis you can actually ask questions to in plain English for like $397/mo.\n\nWay cheaper than hiring and you get answers right away instead of waiting on your accountant to email back three days later.",

And then an hour for marketing/sales. I then have a few hours for meetings. And then I reserve the end of the day, 2 hours for focused work, for me that means making products. Go home, be with family for dinner, read to the kids or sing songs or dance or do yoga with them. And then I get back to work from 8-10, maybe 11.

Now I’m the one who needs help.\n\nI own a small business that I started and fully funded myself. I own 100% of it. I do everything — the work, bookkeeping, taxes, invoicing, customer relations — all of it. and I've been in business for over 2 years\n\nWhen I first started, things were manageable. I paid for materials, tools, and consumables in cash. No loans, no credit cards, no investors, no debt. It felt safe and controlled.\n\nBut as the months went on, the business kept growing. Bigger clients came in. I moved into B2B work with net 30 terms. At first, I was balancing that with smaller cash-paying jobs, which helped with flow.\n\nNow I’m almost strictly B2B. Dee to me not having any physical time for the smaller intricate jobs that takes 6 hours to complete.\n\nAnd my cash flow is terrible.\n\nOn paper, I’m growing every month. I have recurring clients. Work keeps increasing. But because of net 30 terms, I’m constantly waiting to get paid while needing to buy materials for the next round of jobs. I’ve gotten to the point where I’m worried I won’t be able to afford next month’s materials — even though I have the work lined up.\n\nI’ve tried loans which i cant get approved due to my credit and being high risk and grants, but most “grant” programs I find just want fees to “move my application forward,” which feels sketchy. I don’t want to bury myself in bad debt.\n\nThis situation has stressed me to the point of mental exhaustion. I’ve honestly thought about shutting everything down just to relieve the pressure — even though I know the business is growing and has real potential. It feels like I’m growing too fast and I can’t keep up financially.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with rapid growth creating cash flow problems like this?\n\nHow do you manage net 30 clients without constantly feeling underwater?\n\nI don’t want to quit. I just don’t know how to stabilize this.\n\nAny advice would mean a lot.",

If you don’t have what is needed for the job but don’t want to turn it down, get a quote to contract out that part of the work and mark it up 20% to your customer. \n- Try and get a line of credit from your consumables supplier if you have a years long relationship and have been paying them on time. \n- Tell new B2B customers cash or net 10 terms. \n- Increase your bids for customers that demand net 30 terms.\n\nSounds like you are getting flooded with work because your prices are good, but you are carrying the bag for a month of expenses.

New customers always get due in receipt. Only old ones get terms.\n\n4. Do not get structured loan like SBA to finance operations. That’s a business killer.

          "body": "I have been exactly here. What you were dealing with is very normal, and when entrepreneurs are able to navigate this successfully, it’s the difference between a successful company and one that goes bankrupt \n\nNet profitability usually is not what kills a business, usually it is cash flow.\n\nI’ll start by saying, Don’t listen to the people that say “don’t accept net 30 terms”. Those people don’t understand the world and industry that you deal with. Unfortunately, in certain industries, the client sets the terms. We are playing in their world. We can decide to play with them, but that’s simply the way it is. Everything has pros and cons. The benefit to these commercial clients is that they are higher volume, higher value jobs. And usually less time spent/higher margins. The con is that they’re usually net 30+.\n\nSo yes, you can decide to not accept net 30 terms, but now you’re working with a different business model. I’m going to assume you excel in this field and have carved a niche, it is a TOTALLY acceptable business model. \n\nIn 2025, we were 48% commercial and 52% residential. Residential has its headaches, but we still show it a lot of attention and are constantly going after residential jobs, because it’s quick cash. This is what makes payroll. This is what keeps cash in the account when our account receivable is 150 K. Without it, inevitably, we would come to a place where we are borrowing high interest debt to make payroll. That’s not what we want to do.\n\nIf residential simply isn’t an option for you, and there’s absolutely no way for you to get any money down on maybe larger projects on the commercial side, you have to be very careful at how fast you “grow”. In a business with a quick cash conversion cycle, this isn’t as much of a problem. \n\n1. I would recommend firstly finding all the ways you can decrease the overall cash conversion cycle. The first thing you can do is look at every single outgoing payment that you make monthly, and find a way to push those payments off so that the money isn’t taken out of your account 30+ days, or as long as possible.\n\nFor example, we put everything on credit cards. We know that cash isn’t due until at least 30 days from the statement close.\n\nWe have negotiated with all vendors to try to push back payments as late as possible. Sometimes it’s possible and sometimes it’s not. But that is always our goal, to push that outgoing cash as late as possible. \n\nBe very, very careful here, this is where financial discipline comes into play. This is where people get into loads of bad debt. You have to know what’s coming in, when it’s coming in, what you can float, Spreadsheets are your best friend. Don’t sleep on this part, it is VERY important. When this first started to become an issue this bought us almost 30 days for a/r to improve before we had to make those usual payments. It helped us get ahead of the curve and if you haven’t done this yet DO IT. \n\n2. Now you have to figure out how to decrease the cash conversion cycle even more based on income. Is there any possible way to get down payments, can you do more residential, factoring (in extreme case), but you get the idea.\n\n3. Monitor monito monitor monitor. Hire somebody to be in charge of your account receivable. This is a full-time job for us. Do absolutely everything you can to stay on these people. In the commercial world, putting liens on things, this is standard practice. They don’t take it personally, all it does is make you become one of the first people that they pay. We send a letter of intense often, and quiet, we are still working with to this day. We’ve never lost a commercial client by sending a letter of intent. All it does is make sure that it gets to the owner.\n\nHit me up sometime if you ever want to discuss this! There are a lot of things that you can do, but you have to be incredibly intentional",

A bank can give you the liquid cash a day or two after you ship (90%, with the other 10% released when your customer pays). You basically have a rolling loan with the bank, but because it's secured (against your invoices) you get lower interest payments than you would if you used an overdraft etc. \nYou can insure the invoices, so if a customer goes bankrupt and cannot pay, you are insured. Otherwise if you're not insured and that happens, you immediately owe the bank the unpaid value.

Avoid taking loans or using credit cards for the business until you complete #2 below.\n\n2. Find a professional accountant (this may be difficult during tax season). Ask them to review your books thoroughly. Have them analyze your Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L), Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement. If your balance sheet shows structural issues, your business model may be failing. Numbers do not lie.\n\n3. Review all Net 30 customers carefully. If customers exceed payment terms, your credit control process may be ineffective. Ideally, receivables should not go past due — even by one day.\n\n4. Sit down and evaluate 2–3 projects based on gross profit. Determine whether your margins truly cover the cost of capital. As a basic benchmark, if your profit does not exceed approximately 12%, your net return may not justify the risk. This may sound aggressive, but a business must outperform low-risk financial alternatives(Fix CD/ US Bonds). If you cannot outperform safer investment , your strategy may involve high risk with insufficient return. This is a fundamental business principle.\n\n5. Open a separate business account at the same bank. Transfer net profit into that account every time you receive payment. Do not use those funds until you have completed #2.\n\n6. Do not sign leases or long-term contracts until #2 has been completed.\n\n  \n",

I started offering 2% discount for payment within 10 days, full price for Net 30.

Rapid growth is a good problem to have, but it can definitely feel overwhelming when cash flow doesn’t match the workload.\n\nA few things you might consider:\n\t1.\tBusiness credit or line of credit – Even a small credit line can bridge the gap between invoices and expenses. It gives you breathing room without relying on loans with bad terms.\n\t2.\tOutsource non-core tasks – Bookkeeping, invoicing, or even customer follow-ups can be handled by someone else. That frees you to focus on the work that actually brings in revenue.\n\t3.\tSegment your clients – Keep some smaller, quick-turnaround jobs that pay cash to maintain positive cash flow. Maybe hire someone part-time to handle these jobs, so you can focus on the bigger B2B contracts without sinking into a cash crunch.\n\t4.\tInvoice strategy – I know others already covered this but you can offer small incentives for early payment, or split larger invoices into smaller milestones to reduce the net 30 waiting period. Even partial upfront payment helps cover materials.\n\nHope sone of this helps and wish you the best!",

You made the right decisions for a small business, then scaled past the point where those decisions still work. Cash-based operations + net 30 clients = you need either:\n1. Enough cash reserves to float 30-60 days (you don’t have)\n2. Supplier credit that matches client terms (hard to get as solo operator)\n3. Different client mix that pays faster (but you went B2B for stability)\nThe real question: do you want to scale this, or stabilize it?\nBecause scaling means bringing in a partner or taking debt. Stabilizing means capping revenue at whatever you can self-fund.\nThere’s no “hack” that lets a solo operator grow 20% YoY on net 30 terms without external capital. The math doesn’t work.

You'll probably not make any killer connections unless you're the CEO of a major company looking to land some national deals. This doesn't mean they're not useful though. I find they can be very useful as a form of highly focused industry research. Eg: browsing products on the expo floor, getting a temperature of how the industry is heading, having insightful conversation with someone after a panel, going to panels in general that actually hyper relate to something you'd like to improve in your business, etc. These conferences are way more about information gathering. What are your peers doing? How much are they earning? What are they afraid of? It's all useful information to help you pilot the direction of your business. For us it's also a great source of motivation/inspiration. Nothing like being in the fully immersed in your field around people who are as high level as you to give you the perspective you need to keep your personal motivation high. I'd only do something like this though once every 2-3 years at most, probably even less frequently if I had to put a serious travel budget behind it.\n\n- Small, especially semi-local ones are your best networking opportunities. Here it's much more about conversations with the same crowds over a weekend. Our favorite conference we go to every year is just a small few hundred person affair that involves creatives across several fields from greater region in my state. We've connected with some great people to work with through it and have become a little more \"on the map\" in leading design circles in our area just by showing up. Also because its semi-local it's not a huge cost in time or money to attend, which helps and I know every connection I make is someone I could get coffee with the next week. I'd only go to a non-local small conference if my industry was very small-world and I knew connections I made there could actually impact my business direction.",

          "body": "I wouldnt reccomend what you are doing because by choosing no growth you are choosing not to have security. Things change and by not growing your business you cant build up strengh and have to rely on what you have right now. You seem to be taking the attitude that other businesses only fail because of what they control and as long as you do a good job for your customers they will be there forever.\n\nI think a better approach is steady sustainable growth. Build up reserves, take more for your long term retirement needs. It sounds like you are sacrificing opportunity because you see growth as nerveracking and risky. Growth does not have to be seat of your pants and reckless. It also does not need to be stressfull. Dont be afraid of building your business just be thoughful and manage the risks as you go. More revenue, more people is also not just for you. The people that choose to sell thier time to your  business want to prosper as well. They want raises, opportunity and less stress as well. A thriving business means more for them as well.\n\nMe, had I worked for you and it became apparent you had no ambitions for the business and were actually making sure you didnt grow I would have quit immediately.\n\nYour way and that of the people here is not really a business as much as you have put together a job (with presumably modest retirement or long term objectives ) and you like it and want to keep it that way. Often that works fine but if it fails you have to go back to work for someone else so at least understand that risk.",

In one year, turnover has fallen from 7 crore to 2 crore.We are getting complaints about the pressure vessels we manufacture. Workers seem lazy, and quality has dropped.\n\nI’m currently studying BSc Data Science, which has nothing to do with fabrication. I don’t know anything about pressure vessels, welding, AutoCAD, production planning, client handling, inspections, or site work.\n\nTo make it more complicated:\n\nSome workers are relatives.\n\nI suspect mismanagement.\n\nI don’t fully trust my cousin.\n\nI don’t know how to talk confidently with workers or clients.\n\nI don’t want to sound rude, but I also don’t want to look weak.\n\nI feel completely unprepared.\n\nIf I want to take control:\n\nWhere do I start learning this industry from scratch? (AutoCAD, fabrication drawings, welding standards, pressure vessel codes, etc.)\n\nHow do I audit whether the business is being mismanaged?\n\nHow do I deal with workers who are older than me and don’t take me seriously?\n\nHow do I communicate firmly without creating family drama?\n\nWhat should my first 3–6 months plan look like?\n\nI’m not looking for motivation. I need practical steps.\n\nIf anyone here runs a fabrication/engineering/manufacturing business or has taken over a family business young, please guide me.\n\nThanks.",

No one but you should have the ability to release payments. \n- Post a job and hire a senior technical person who has been in the pressure vessel industry for good 15-20 years.\n- If unable to hire this experienced person full time, bring him on a retainer and learn the trade from him. He could be a consultant and he should be your guy! \n- Get your hands dirty. Learn the trade on the ground. For example, if you get a new order, tell the current team that you will work with them and finish the entire order with you on the line.  Even if it means working alongside the labor because unless you know the product/process inside out, they will/may keep fooling you. \n- Contact the customer that complained about the product. Check with your consultant that you will bring on board on what went sideways and consult your internal technical team as well. It could just be a case of order getting completed but the revenue may be pocketed by someone internally. \n- Investigate the dropped revenue and check with those clients who no longer deal with your company on what went wrong? \n\nTake immediate control before your family/employees eat the company out from the inside. Good luck! ",

Right now you have 4 parallel problems (as per your post):\n\n1. Technical knowledge gap\n\n2. Operational breakdown\n\n3. Financial opacity\n\n4. Family power dynamics\n\nIf you try to solve it all at once, you will end up drowning. \n\nHere is what your first 90 days should look like:\n\nMonth 1: Observe, don’t react: Sit inside operations daily. Shop floor. Client calls. Vendor calls.\n\nAsk dumb questions. Take notes.\n\nGet access to full financials; last 24 months. Cash flow, receivables, payables. Everything related to money coming in and going out. \n\nList all active orders and their status. Do not assume anything. Note it only if it exists on paper. \n\nYour only focus in Month 1: understand the business reality.\n\nMonth 2: Audit quietly\n\nCheck: Why did revenue fall from 7 to 2? Lost clients? Pricing? Delays? Quality issues?\n\nSpeak to 3–5 old clients directly. Ask what changed.\n\nCheck production rejection rate and complaint logs.\n\nMap who actually makes decisions today. On paper and in reality.\n\n\nIf you suspect mismanagement, you need data to validate it and not confrontation.\n\nMonth 3: Take controlled authority\n\nDefine weekly production targets.\n\nImplement a simple reporting rhythm (daily output, order status, cash position).\n\nSeparate relatives from roles. No one is “family” in a production meeting. Only role and output matter.\n\n\nNow about workers older than you: you do not earn authority through volume. You earn it through clarity.\n\nDon’t say “I think.”\nSay: “This is the plan for this week. Here’s what we are tracking.” Calm. Measured. Structured. Consistent.\n\nOn technical learning: You do not need to become the best welder. You need enough knowledge to not be fooled.\n\nStart with: Basic pressure vessel fundamentals\n\n1. ASME codes overview\n\n2. Welding process basics\n\n3. Quality inspection checklist\n\n4. Visit competitors quietly if possible\n\nSpend 60–90 mins daily learning for 6 months. This compounding matters. Most importantly, control cash first. Every rupee. A traditional business dies from cash suffocation before ego issues.\n\nAnd one hard truth: If your cousin is mismanaging, this will become political. So build numbers as proof before you build arguments.\n\nI don't think you are unprepared, you are just early to the game. If you want, you can reach out directly. I am not an industry expert in fabrication, but I can help you think through structure, authority, and 90-day execution without emotion. All the best!",

When my dad passed way in a car accident, and our small business was a completely different industry of high volume/low margins, I had two brothers who could go back home and spend months getting everything in place. All of us spent many many hours in our youth working in the business, so even if we had been away for 5-15 years, we had familiarity and knew people. \n\nOne brother had been accepted to a PhD program and had 6 months until it starts and was just working ac lab job he could easily quit. \n\nAnother brother had an mbA and was working for a big-5 consulting firm but had been told he wasn’t on track to make partner. He had 12 months to find other work and they let him have up to a month off to go take care of the family business. \n\nBut also different from yours, the business finances were in shambles and none of us knew (not even my mom). \n\nI guess the reason I tell this story even though different is that these first months are critical. You keep saying that you will hire a manager once you have the money, but the whole thing could be lost by then. \n\nAfter everything was stabilized, we ended up selling to cousins running a similar business two towns over. It ended up great for my mom, who didn’t have to go start looking for her first job since college at age 56, but we had to jump in immediately to make sure the business was worth something to sell.",

You might be able to have A.I. figure out ways to at least give you some solid overviews. I'm a big believer in when I want to learn anything, I need to start focusing on the most basic, elementary elements before trying to say \"remember random things\".\n\nI view that like a tree analogy. You want to understand some of the roots, then the main part of the tree, eventually get to the branches, and finally get to the leaves. People get overwhelmed when they start with random leaves...   This is just about that business as a whole. Next piece would be simply being in and around the business and just absorbing what's going on. I also would probably have AI research a bunch of competitors and try to figure out what they are doing that's working well. If you have any documented SOPs, I certainly would be putting those into AI for analysis.\n\nThere's a lot more on the human side, like the distrust of the cousin and perhaps the element that your time is split between serious study and this business dilemma. If you actually have a controlling interest in this business, then I would think the three things you may want are either to learn it and run it yourself successfully, or to get more experienced management to come help turn it around and increase the value of it. Build water! Then either way, possibly set it up to sell. Right now, you don't want to set it up to sell if you're 65% down in revenue with problems.

It sounds like your father was the glue that kept the entire operation running and your sales will go to zero soon if no one else knows what’s going on.  A lot of small businesses go this direction unfortunately.  You may need to figure out how much runway you have - what are your costs / month. What are your employee wages / month. Then how much money is currently in the bank and how much do you have currently invoiced?  You may have a few months left before you run out of money and employees can no longer be paid. \n\nIf you insist on running it yourself you need to understand what gaps now exist in the business now that your father is no longer here. What specific business-critical roles/responsibilities belonged to him? which can be transferred to current employees, and which can be transferred to you, if you can learn them?. The rest may need to be hired out to a new employee. \n\nIt helps to create a value stream map of the entire business operation from quotation to product delivery. It can be a tedious process but can help you got a real handle on the workflow and identifying technical gaps. You may find that your dad was responsible for some technical/compliance related thing (like an engineering stamp?) that the entire business hinges on and also requires education/training/certification that will be impossible to replace from within.",

          "body": "Sorry for your loss, and my honest advice will be:   \n1. First and foremost - Be the BOSS. You are young, new to business. Everyone will take you for granted. If revenue drops because of poor quality, so should the salary drop/firing happen. Burtal but this is how you get control in any business. Never hesitate to fire or give pay cuts to people if productivity or revenue is going low. Give a paycut on long breaks/poor output, and you will be surprised by the magic.   \n2. a) Customer is KING. Meet them, understand the issue, and understand what the problem is. Talk to the person/team in your company who manages it. If there is no one fill the gap. If there is someone already, then find the issue; either they need to be fired or schooled properly.   \n2. b) Also, if you are in a concentrated business where a few customers dictate a lot of revenue, and there is no other face right now, you will also need to step up or get a face. Impressions matter a lot many times, and you will have to see and decide. Don't be a person they can't trust. Don't promise what you don't know. It's better to speak less than wrong.   \n3. Have the right mix of patience + speed. Very important, don't let emotions make you hasty decisions. If you see someone even cheating on you, maybe even a cousin, the first step would be still play a friend and just migrate all important information from them to someone you trust or yourself, and then take actions againts them. Still, you need to have speed else world is too competitive, and someone else will eat your lunch. Competitors are always on the lookout for your weak spots. Same for the positive side, don't be overjoyous on large orders, have patience, scale with patience.   \n4. Find a mentor whom you can trust and who has seen at least 5x or more scale of your current business. Both points are equally important. This should not be the immediate priority, but definitely in the long run. But don't trust anyone blindly. \n\nMade a lot of mistakes in my early 20s, these are just to help. ",

If they fumble the answer, your positioning is the bottleneck, not your distribution.\n\nThe other pattern worth flagging: low ticket + paid acquisition + no organic is a treadmill. Every month you stop running ads, revenue drops. That's not a growth wall — it's a dependency wall. The businesses I've seen break through this plateau usually do one of two things: move upmarket (fewer customers, higher price, better margins, referrals actually start happening because the relationship is deeper), or build a content moat that compounds over 6-12 months. Trying to do both simultaneously is how most founders burn out at this stage.\n\nOn the hire question: don't hire for growth. Hire for the specific bottleneck. If positioning is the problem, a growth marketer won't fix it. If lead quality is the problem, more volume makes it worse. Figure out which wall you're actually hitting before you write a job description.",

So you can continue pushing ads and widening the top of funnel but it's just spreading out your efforts further. \n\nI'd focus in on dropping something a bit more premium. We are working with an apparel shop right now in a niche space. Their focus of their new drop is to move away from the 'etsy style' designs and more into a trendy, premium-looking product.

Here's what I'd focus on in the next 30 days:\n\nBrand mentions without links actually matter a lot for entity recognition. Get mentioned in local news, industry blogs, chamber of commerce newsletters, even podcast interviews where your business name gets said out loud (transcripts get indexed). Google uses these to understand what your brand \"is.\"\n\nContent that explicitly answers \"What is [Your Business Name]?\" in multiple places. Create a detailed About page, a FAQ that addresses your specific services, and a few blog posts that use your exact brand name in the title and body naturally. You want Google to see 10+ pages across the web clearly stating what you do.\n\nBacklinks still help, but quality over quantity. One link from a relevant industry site or local news outlet is worth 50 directory links. Reach out to suppliers, partners, anyone who already works with you and ask if they'll add you to their partners page.\n\nLocal press is underrated. Send a simple story pitch to your local news about what makes your business different or any community involvement. Even a small mention with your name and what you do can shift Google's understanding.\n\nSpeed matters too. If someone already claimed your brand name on social platforms or review sites, make sure you're active there and linking back to your site. Consistency across channels signals authority.\n\nIf I had 30 days, I'd do local PR first (easiest brand mention), then content clarifying exactly what you are (FAQ + About pages), then reach out for 3 to 5 quality backlinks from real partners. You're not fighting an algorithm, you're teaching Google what your brand actually is.\n\nHave you checked Google Search Console to see what queries are actually triggering your site? Sometimes the issue is your pages aren't ranking for your own brand name, which is a different fix.",

Brand mention campaigns - Reach out to past customers for testimonials that specifically mention your brand name. Even unlinked mentions help Google understand brand association.\n\n2. Strategic content creation - Create a 'Brand vs Alternatives' comparison page that naturally positions you as the original/primary option. This helps clarify the relationship to Google.\n\n3.

          "body": "Because most business advice comes from people who’ve never had to get a stranger to trust them with no brand, no proof, and no referral.\n\nThe corporate playbook assumes you already have traffic, pipeline, brand recognition, and a sales team. Strip all that away and you’re left with the actual hard part — getting someone who has no reason to care about you to believe you can solve their problem.\n\nI’ve spent 15+ years working with small service businesses and I’ll tell you what actually works at that stage because it’s stupidly simple and nobody talks about it.\n\nGo find people who have the problem you solve and tell them what’s wrong. For free. No pitch. No “let me know if you need help.” Just show them something about their own situation that they didn’t see before.\n\nI literally got my first handful of clients by looking at local businesses and pointing out specific things that were costing them money. Not vague “your marketing could be better” stuff. Specific, concrete, “you’re losing customers here and here’s why” stuff. Half of them didn’t hire me. The other half couldn’t hire me fast enough because nobody had ever just told them the truth without trying to sell them something first.\n\nThat’s the part the LinkedIn crowd will never teach you. At the startup and small business level, the sale happens when someone realizes you see their problem more clearly than they do. Not when you pitch them a solution. Not when you close them with some framework. When they feel genuinely understood by someone who clearly knows what they’re looking at.\n\nThe advice isn’t sexy. Go find 10 businesses this week. Look at what they’re doing. Tell them what you see. Don’t ask for anything. Some of them will ask you what it would cost to fix it. That’s your first clients.\n\nEverything else — the funnels, the content strategy, the sales process — that’s all stuff you build after you’ve proven you can actually help someone. Not before.",

          "body": "Honestly? Because most of the people giving advice skipped the part you are in.\n\nThey are talking about optimizing pipelines and tightening close rates.\n\nYou are just trying to get someone to say yes.\n\nEarly stage problems are not “How do I increase conversion by 2 percent?”\n\nThey are:\n\nHow do I get my first 5 customers?\n\nHow do I talk to businesses when nobody knows who we are?\n\nHow do I not feel like I am faking it every time I pitch?\n\nThe reason it all sounds corporate is because it is optimization advice, not survival advice.\n\nHere is the simple version nobody says clearly.\n\nSales only happen in 4 ways:\n\nKnown. People who already know you.\n\nUnknown. Strangers you reach out to directly.\n\nOrganic. Content people find over time.\n\nPaid. Ads, affiliates, sponsorships.\n\nThat's it. All current, past and future conversations will fall into one of those buckets.\n\nMost startups try to jump straight to organic or paid because it feels scalable and legit. It's a tremendous waste of capital and time to try and validate your stuff by paying to show it to others.\n\nBut if you cannot sell one on one to:\n\nSomeone who already knows you\n\nOr a complete stranger\n\nThen ads will just amplify the fact that the offer or messaging is not dialed in yet.\n\nThe unsexy path actually works:\n\nFirst, go to your “known” network. Make a list of 20 people. Start conversations. Not hard pitches. Just real conversations. There should be somebody who's you either know or somebody who knows somebody else in your network who could utilize your solution typically.\n\nThen move to “unknown.” Pick one channel. Cold email, cold call, DMs, whatever. Talk to 5 strangers a day. You will suck at first. That is the point. Just execute, everybody wants some sort of magic bullet. They're looking for a Xanax pill that's going to just blow them up overnight when really what they need is physical therapy. You have to get really good at selling this thing. Two strangers before you can graduate to the next steps.\n\nOnce you can consistently sell one on one, then start making content based on the exact questions people keep asking you.\n\nThen, and only then, scale it with paid.\n\nYour friend is partially right about sales, it's the lifeblood of any business and the reality is that most businesses are shockingly bad at it.\n\nIt is because you are guessing which of the four lanes you are actually in.\n\nFor now you just need to stick with one thing and get really good at that channel.\n\n[I explain the whole breakdown here if you want it laid out clearly.](https://youtu.be/5EjzIA-Zyd8?si=zuPJs2PCpaC2-Exn)\n\nIt will probably save you a lot of wasted time and money",

If you are not a secured creditor, you're the last in line, and people don't file for bankruptcy (or get forced into an adversarial bankruptcy) when they're flush with cash. The likelihood of you getting anything is remote.

Even if the business did pay you, a bankruptcy trustee can claw back recent payments made to your business, claiming they were preferential payments to the detriment of other creditors. \n\nWhere it gets more sticky is when this causes chain reactions.

One SKU = one income account. Stripe fees and refunds can batch at month-end instead of per-transaction.\n\nThe $147 mystery is probably a timing mismatch between when Stripe deposits vs when QB records the sale.

While this is more true when the owner is a service provider (ie. go get one more client and it pays for the bookkeeper), I still think it is true in an e-commerce business as well. Go spend time on revenue generating tasks that you’re best at, and the bookkeeping will get done without you.\n\n2) e-commerce is one of the hardest types of bookkeeping, so doing it yourself will take a long time to get right. With sales tax and inventory in particular, it is just a longer process, whether it’s you or a bookkeeper handling it.\n\nIf you go the bookkeeper route, I would bet it wouldn’t be nearly as high as the $1500 per month you said. Maybe that’s what your CPA quoted you? Roughly half that is what I would think is reasonable.\n\nIf you do it yourself, you will get better! It gets easier each month as you learn the process.

Bookkeeping takes longer and is less accurate the more \"complexity drivers\" your business has.  \nThe key is to figure out what those complexity drivers are, and how much control you have over them with both your digital and also real life processes.  \nUsing personal accounts to pay for business expenses, and vice versa, is huge complexity driver that can disappear simply by the business owner stopping that bad habit.  100% control on that one.  Employees, AP, AR, Inventory, all varying complexity drivers you're stuck with.  What real life processes and standardizations can happen to reduce their time suck?  \nE-commerce is a HUGE complexity driver, greater than we may recognize.  Though, I think you're feeling it right now!!  Ask your accountant if they can see any ways to reduce the complexity here (and in other areas).  They may have some great insights.  I know many e-commerce firms use A2X, but I don't have experience there myself. In Canada, there's a great firm [https://www.financly.ca/](https://www.financly.ca/) (no affiliation, I just refer them cuz they're the best I know) that does e-commerce bookkeeping consultation.

Almost every task I need to do requires multiple steps in different systems. \n\nI'm asking other owner/operators in the same size range (\\~30-50 folks) what they use as the nerve center for their business. I guess there's ERP systems but having implemented them for other clients, those SUCK, are ancient and aren't a great fit for professional services type businesses. In my industry there's Jira, MS Project (🤮), Rally, Linear, etc but I'm not just an engineer anymore I've got to switch between project oversight, finance, ops, marketing, HR etc. no way to run all of that in Jira though the Tempo plugin is amazing. \n\nThere was a system a few years ago that acted as like an app launcher or a central hub pulling in data from different systems but I can't remember their name for the life of me and they aren't promoting like they were before so I fear they're lost to the sands of time.\n\nI feel like this is what's driving more and more apps/sites to be built bridging all of this data and all of these systems. But in reality you wind up with a patchwork of zaps, data all over the place and spotty docs so when someone new comes in 4 years later they look around confused.\n\nDoes anyone have central systems that they actually like and aren't painful? \n\nI should note this is NOT AN INVITATION FOR BOTS TO PITCH ME RANDOM AI STUFF.
