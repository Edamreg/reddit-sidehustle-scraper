      "selftext": "So I started a lawn care business a little over a month ago (proof on my post history) and ended up scoring 25 clients in one month from leaving door hangers \n\nI worked on a realtors lawn and she was complaining to me about how people park in her 5 acre lot without permission during a very popular event in my city during October. And she offered me $50 to drive there, dig a hole and leave a sign that said ‚Äúprivate property, no trespassing, property is under surveillance 24/7‚Äù so I can tell she REALLY didn‚Äôt want people on her property. \n\nSo instead of accepting the job I offered her to manage the parking lot and charge people for parking and we can split the money. We agreed on 50/50.\n\nFast forward a few days ago , I paid for a few signs and printed pages saying ‚Äúparking $10‚Äù which only costed me a few bucks. \n\nWent there at 1pm and started charging people $10 each for parking. I made $5 for every car that passed \n\nAfter 4 hours charging people non stop I made a total of $4,700 in just parking fees, minus $100 in set up costs. $4,600 profit split between the property owner and took myself $2,300 home today. I am going to do this for 3 more Saturday‚Äôs to pull in some serious dough.\n\nGonna use my profit to buy a nice truck cash for my lawn care business. \n\nOpportunities are out there, is there a chance that you‚Äôre going to do the exact same thing I did and replicate my success? Most likely not but what does help is having the mind of a hustler and noticing dollar bills when people are in pain. ",

You pay an hourly fee and rent a grandma to go with you and skip lines at the bank or supermarket or whatever.. snacks are included\n\n \n- Google lens kind of app specialized in translating doctors handwriting\n \n\n- stray cat‚Äôs and dogs printing system. You would print ads in their fur so they go around town showing it off. The money would helo paying for sterilization and other vet bills for them. \n\n \n- lazy food brand - food for people too lazy to prepare it. Cookies already pre-socked in milk; nachos pre-covered in guacamole, pre-sliced oranges, etc\n\n \n- make religious ‚Äúp0rn‚Äù movies - an electrician that enters a client‚Äôs house barefoot with a power drill in hand to fix a tv, while the client is a pretty woman in only a bath robe (like most movies of the kind), but the plot twist is that he really just fixes the tv, they pray together a few minutes and part their ways, no funny business.\n\n \n- tinder app for elderly people. Instead of the current tinder like/dislike mechanic, in works like uber and just connects them to the nearest available option.\n\n \n- poop gamification. A smart toilet where you login each time and compete with friends to see who poops the most in a week, or the heaviest. In my head and with the right skills, you could maybe even play poop battleship with friends\n\n \n- brown emergency lights (like the blue ones police attached to cars roofs in the movies) for when you need to get home fast to poop\n\n \n\nPs: I usually get my ideas at night when I suffer from insomnia, so some might be a bit delusional.. imagine the fun I had reading them in the morning though :)\n \n\nPS2: if any of you can get any of these ideas working, update me, I‚Äôd love to see it ahah",

I kind of only half listened because he'd mentioned sportsbooks and betting and I really didn't want to get involved with gambling but the way he explained it actually made it clear that it's not gambling at all. So a few days later, I did my own research (im careful, but i think that's for the best) and more and more i realized how the whole thing worked. Because you hedge any bets you place, you are always making sure you have all of the outcomes covered so technically you can't lose and I know it sounds too good to be true but really it's just math. And then you use sportsbook promos to extract actual money. It's not a get rich quick thing but that's not what i was looking for, just wanted a small hustle i can pick up whenever i have time and not worry about it.",

      "selftext": "I‚Äôm an Automotive Technician with over two decades of experience.  I‚Äôve always worked for a dealership, but recently formed my own business on the side.  I went through all the legalities of doing it the correct way; where I registered with the state and county that I‚Äôm in, got my EIN, and opened a business account.  Once it was all set up, I made a website, leased an office space and started advertising on social media.\n\nIt started out slowly‚Äî after the first 30 days I was questioning whether it was even worth it.  I barely made enough that month to cover business expense.  However, it began to snowball after I landed some mid-tier jobs and started to get 5 star reviews on Google.  Consistent advertising through instagram fueled the fire, while creating content on YouTube on the cars I was working on showcased my skills.\n\nFast forward today and after a short 7 months in operation, I‚Äôve managed to build roughly $38k in business capital‚Äî all net profit.  The jobs I‚Äôm landing are also getting bigger.  I‚Äôm billing out dealership-level work orders and gaining repeat clients to boot.  Most recently; I performed a major engine overhaul on a clients car that was billed out at nearly $7k.  A week later he dropped his other car off with me to get it up to snuff on maintenance and any other repairs it needed.\n\nAs the work becomes consistent, I‚Äôm finding it difficult to juggle both the W2 and my own ‚Äúside business‚Äù‚Ä¶ which as of late I consider more of a full time business than anything‚Äî as all of the free time I have outside of the W2 is dedicated to building the business and scaling it up.  I know at some point, I‚Äôm going to have to choose between the two and I‚Äôm already strategizing how that will play out.  If things continue to accelerate at the pace that it has been, I see myself making the side hustle my main hustle and just picking up a part time job as a bartender or something‚Ä¶ start networking and gaining clients that way.\n\nWhen I formed this business, I had my doubts on whether it would amount to anything.  Now I‚Äôm proud of what it has become and excited to see what it will eventually be.  \n\nBest advice I can give anyone that‚Äôs thinking of starting something on the side is this:  \n\n‚Ä¢Identify what you do best, and capitalize on that and that alone. (I‚Äôm a Mechanic‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt make sense for me to open a food truck).\n\n‚Ä¢Be prepared and put systems in place to keep you organized- keep your books tight.\n\n‚Ä¢Realize there will be monetary risks.  Start small, budget wisely, and don‚Äôt get over leveraged.\n\n‚Ä¢You will make mistakes- learn from them.\n\n‚Ä¢Don‚Äôt chase $, chase client satisfaction and those 5 star reviews.\n\n‚Ä¢The reward reflects the time and effort put in.\n\nHope this was interesting and that it inspires some people.  üîß \n\n",

      "selftext": "I used to treat tools like toys, fun to play with, but not serious. I‚Äôd mess around for a bit, close the tab, move on. But somehow, a few of those random things ended up quietly making me money.\n\nHeyEtsy was one of the first. I only even bothered opening it because someone mentioned it in some random Reddit thread. This thing actually shows you what's really selling, not just what's, like, all over your feed. I started using it to just peek at the real numbers before I wasted another 10 hours designing totally random crap. That tiny shift literally saved me from launching a dozen flops.\n\nThen came CheckEtsy basically, it tells you which keywords actually convert. Not ‚Äútrending,‚Äù not ‚Äúhyped,‚Äù but selling. That‚Äôs how one of my listings accidentally became my top earner. Not because I was smart, I just followed the data for once.\n\nIdeogram and Midjourney completely blew my mind, too. Instead of literally slaving away for hours designing from scratch, I could just pump out a bunch of concepts in minutes, pick the decent ones, and quickly clean them up. It wasn‚Äôt even about 'AI magic,' really, it was just about pure speed - getting to the next idea way faster.\n\nAnd this one still kinda trips me out: some random little Google indexing tool I stumbled upon online. It basically made my pages show up on search way, way faster. Nothing fancy, at all, but it was like a secret shield, making sure all the stuff I'd already bothered building didn't just vanish into the internet abyss.\n\nNone of these tools made me rich, obviously. But man, together they just shaved off all the soul-crushing, boring parts and let me actually focus on the fun stuff. They basically kept my side hustle chugging along while I was busy pretending to take breaks.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the one tool that ended up helping you more than you expected?\n\n",

      "selftext": "I‚Äôve been digging into what it really takes to turn a blog into a money maker in 2025, and one thing keeps coming up is consistency. If you publish only once in a while, you‚Äôll never build enough momentum for search engines or readers to trust you. It is the bloggers who post weekly or more tend that scale much faster when it comes to traffic. Over time, that regular output compounds into more keywords, internal links, and authority, which are all essential for real income growth.\n\nMonetization usually starts with ads and affiliate links. A good benchmark is RPM, which means revenue per 1,000 pageviews. Currently, I have monetized my blog with Google Ad sense and the RPM usually hovers around $10-15. \n\nLooking at more successful blogs, many now report around $20 to $30 RPM on average across combined ad and affiliate income. For example, 20,000 monthly pageviews at a $25 RPM equals about $500 per month. \n\nOnce you meet traffic thresholds, you can also apply for premium ad networks, which often pays $12 to $30 or more per thousand views. AdSense and similar networks pay differently by region, with traffic from the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. earning much higher rates. As your blog grows, you can add digital products, sponsored posts, or courses. Blogs with multiple income streams can reach $50 to $100 RPM or higher.\n\nThe potential is real. But you need consistent posting, good SEO, and the patience to build authority. If you‚Äôre starting or trying to grow a blog this year, focus on steady publishing, optimizing for high-value countries, and gradually improving your monetization setup.\n\nIf you have any questions about monetization and the likes, let me know.

You could do surveys but that will take a long time.\n\nYour best bet is Uber, Ubereats, doordash, Amazon delivery. \n\nThe best way to make money online without having to do anything is investing money into inex funds like the S&amp;P 500 (FXAIX, VOO, etc.).

I‚Äôm open to learning new things and willing to put in the time, but I just need something that values my time and effort and actually provides a reasonable return. I‚Äôm not looking for something that requires years of experience, but I do want something where I can develop skills and get paid fairly.

Find products your audience already talks about or asks for and drop Amazon Associates or ShareASale links. If your pages are niche-specific even better - reach out to brands directly for commission deals.\n\nDigital products take time to create but if you know your audience well it's worth it. Even something simple like a $7-15 PDF guide or checklist can add up when you're hitting 100K+ impressions monthly. Test it small before investing too much time.\n\nThe Facebook invite thing is a black box honestly. I wouldn't count on it happening soon. Focus on what you can control right now.",

Also hired a graphic artist to do all the graphics for my page and the ones used in my videos.  Taught myself Davinci Resolve for video editing as well. After about a year with no success I kinda burnt out.\n\nI started posting a few videos again since last week and views and watch time have started to pick up again.\n\nI plan to release a video every week but does someone have advice on how to grow and promote my channel? In particular how to translate all those views and watch hours into subscribers?\n\nI've already done pretty much everything that is usually listed on Google posts on the topic.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Last 4 months  $103.47 (RPM \\~$2.1). \\~5-6 hrs/wk filming/editing.\n* Turo (2022 Prius): 9 days booked last 3 months, gross $358 ‚Üí after Turo fee/insurance/cleaning, net $237; minus a $35 tire patch = $202 take-home. Spent \\~25 minutes scrubbing a stale coffee smell out of the Prius before a pickup - renter no-showed anyway.\n* Task monkey (chrome extension) - funny enough, I tried it on Amazon October Prime Day last week and it got me like $138 back from price drop. Probably the only thing I'd call \"passive income.\"no link/ not affiliated.\n\nHalf a year in, I don't buy the \"work hard and it‚Äôll click\" thing anymore. Most of this stuff is the same tricks with a new label. You put in hours, spend a little cash, and it stalls out. The only money I saw was small and hands-on. Not passive - just extra shifts on a different screen. If you've got something that really pays without babysitting, I'm listening.",

I'm not making any money, and it's getting frustrating.\n\nI know a lot of people are in the same boat, so I thought we could create a helpful resource for everyone.\n\nSo, no matter how much you're earning, please share your business or income source. What do you actually do to make money? Whether it's a full-time job, a side hustle, a small business, or something else entirely, please share the details.\n\nThe more honest and elaborate you are, the more this post will help people like me who are just starting out and need some guidance.\n\nThanks in advance for sharing!",

I have a lot of free time and tried everything I could online to turn minutes into dollars, this is the best thing I've found thats worth your time!\n\nWhen companies create / alter product lines.. they want to get a feel for how to general market will enjoy/dislike the product. Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

I mean, really, there's no exact science, but those that are afraid to \"click a link\" because someone is trying to make money. I mean, I get it, tons of scammers out there. But, this attitude? Do you buy from Amazon? Walmart? Just like everyone hates on MLM companies. Said company has a product for the said entrepreneurs who sign up to sell said product. I mean, many of the products actually just sell themselves really, but other times, it's literally like pulling teeth. I can only imagine if the car salesman had just as hard a time selling a car as an MLM product? Or, what if the car salesman was required to be a business owner in order to sell the car provided by someone else? \n\nStarting a business isn't rocket science, but in this day and age, it takes an arm and a leg to getvone started and then another arm before your first client or sell. And yet, you'll hear people say things like \"should have earned a degree\" or \"maybe you should find a better job,\" \nmeanwhile, people trying to actually come up in the world and start something from nothing? With this attitude üòí \n\nMake sure you don‚Äôt click any links. Someone might actually earn something. Just because you're having a hard time doesn't mean you can't find 10 to 20 dollars to support someone and their endeavors.\n\nYou literally have people (like me) trying to help others and find ways to benefit everyone. \n\nWe literally need to be building each other up instead of tearing them down.",

You don‚Äôt need a huge following or fancy setup, just the right systems and consistency. I joined a community that teaches how to use AI to build those small income streams step-by-step, and it opened my eyes to how much you can actually make from your phone and Wi-Fi.

It's not a ton, and the good outdoor paint that lasts is expensive so my margins aren't massive but its a good few hundred extra. It's very niche tho, and having a network of barns and horse owners is sorta imperative for this kinda thing. \n\nBut if you have a couple extra hours each week, making things and selling them is a great way to make some side money (especially if you have farmer's markets or flea markets in your area).

You need to find a good contact or agency or smth\n\nThe market is oversaturated for most kinds of existing jobs, in order to earn money doing simple work you should travel in time 15 years in the past\n\nTake time doing what youre doing, patience is important, getting a good amount of money in a short period of time (less than a month) is highly improbable\n\nThe last thing is advertise your stuff, be the most annoying you can be with it, share it everywhere\n\nI know all of this advice is well-known stuff already, but im trying to help anyone new who wants to start online, hope i did.

Every person who‚Äôs built something that earns passively has paid in *either time, money, or both.*\n\nIf you‚Äôre starting from $0, that‚Äôs fine but be ready to grind. Learn copywriting, create digital products, start a YouTube channel, build a blog, anything. But if your plan is to do nothing and somehow earn something, you‚Äôre better off buying a lottery ticket.\n\nPeople love the idea of ‚Äúpassive income‚Äù because it sounds effortless.

Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research.

I make posts on Reddit, Threads ,FB and Instagram - and people find my content and buy through my links.\n\nIt‚Äôs honestly one of the easiest ways to start online because you don‚Äôt need to be an influencer or have followers.

          "body": "Building $3,000 per month in passive income will take time, but it‚Äôs absolutely doable if you focus on the right systems and lean into your strengths.\n\nGiven your experience in IT, Agile, and coaching, one of the best places to start is creating and selling digital products based on your knowledge. That could be templates for project planning, Agile sprint boards, training slide decks, or even Notion or Airtable setups for productivity. You can sell these on Gumroad or Etsy. Once created, these digital products can generate income over time without ongoing work.\n\nYou could also consider launching a small online course or coaching bundle. You don‚Äôt need a big production or a huge audience. Even a short workshop or a focused email course can be sold on platforms like Gumroad or Teachable. With your background, people will pay to learn how to manage projects, navigate Scrum roles, or improve productivity in their own teams.\n\nAffiliate marketing is another path worth exploring. You can earn when someone buys through your link, and this works well when you‚Äôre recommending tools you genuinely use or believe in. The key is to learn how to make persuasive content, whether through blog posts, short videos, or email guides, that helps people make a buying decision. I walk through how to do this step by step in my newsletter if you‚Äôre interested.\n\nGiven your love for cooking and healthy living, you could also create a faceless YouTube channel, digital cookbook, or a healthy meal planner. These kinds of content can be monetized through ads, affiliate links, and digital product sales. It‚Äôs not instant, but over time, it can grow into a reliable income stream.\n\nPrint-on-demand could also complement your creative interests. You can design wellness-themed journals, recipe logs, or even merch with positive messages and sell them on platforms like Printful through Etsy.\n\nYou already have the discipline, knowledge, and mindset. Now it‚Äôs just a matter of choosing one or two paths and going deep instead of wide. I break down each of these ideas with examples and tutorials in my newsletter. Feel free to check it out, the link is in my bio.",

For example:\n\nDigital courses or templates for Agile and Scrum professionals.¬†You can create things like sprint planners, team-building exercises, or short leadership workshops and sell them automatically.\n\nHealthy lifestyle or productivity printables.¬†You already live that life, so share what works for you through planners, checklists, or habit trackers.\n\nAffiliate blogs or newsletters.¬†Start one around self-improvement or healthy living and use affiliate links for tools or books you already recommend.\n\nWorkshops that turn into self-paced products.¬†Host a few short sessions, record them, and sell them later as evergreen content.\n\nThe easiest way to get started is to build one thing that earns $100 a month and then stack it. Thirty small, consistent earners will reach your goal. Focus on creating simple, useful products and automating everything possible.\n\nIt might take a few months to build momentum, but with your mindset and skill set, it is absolutely within reach.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training glfrom beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free! At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

      "selftext": "I feel like most people on this page don't actually understand what passive income is. By no means am I a pro, but here is what I do. \n\nI live in the Dominican Republic, and have started with a few investments. I have a motorcycle that I bought for $400 and a Tri-moto (basically a three wheeler but has a truck bed in the back of the motocycle.) Which are commonly used to haul building materials, trash, or help people move as well as many other things. The Tri-moto was $3000. Every day, except for Sunday the motorcycle brings in $4 and the Tri-moto brings in  $12. Weekly that is an income of $96, minus the $18 I pay to someone to manage this. So every month I'm making $312 for doing absolutely nothing. \n\nI know it's not much. But it feels great to be getting these systems started. It's about 10% of what I need to live my life, so a good start. The plan now is to save 100% of this until I can get another tri-moto. \n\nFeel like I need to say this because everyone here is always selling a course. Well, I don't have one. Just common sense. Find something someone needs for a job, and rent it to them. Everyone wins. ",

Most of them are just selling guides or courses, and *that's* how they make their money not from the methods they‚Äôre advertising. They prey on people hoping for easy cash, selling info that should honestly be free.\n\nThe truth is, people who are actually making money don‚Äôt usually need to prove it, because they‚Äôre not trying to sell you anything. I‚Äôve personally been making money through affiliate marketing for the past 18 years. It *does* work, but it‚Äôs not instant, and it definitely takes effort to learn and grow. That‚Äôs usually where people give up right at the beginning when it feels hard or slow.\n\nBottom line: **Effort = Results.** If you‚Äôre serious about it and want to talk more, feel free to DM me.

Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

Prolific apparently has a waitlist but I will reccomend it to everybody. Its legitimate and will always be helpful if you're looking for some side money with little time. DA, well. Look it up, decide if its for you. There's a lot of time investment upfront taking the tests and getting in. After that, it's longer time commitments, like at least an hour at a time to do things.

I have a lot of free time and tried everything I could online to turn minutes into dollars, this is the best thing I've found thats worth your time!\n\nWhen companies create / alter product lines.. they want to get a feel for how to general market will enjoy/dislike the product. Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

The instructions say to submit the document through a provided link.\n\nIs this a normal procedure?\n\nThank you very much for any input! ",

When I could finally login, my task queue was completely empty, as well as my job history/applied jobs etc. I can't even edit my payment or job information. \n\nIs someone else experimenting this? I've tried to fix the problem by clearing my cookies and such, but I can't simply log in to work on my task queue. I am a little baffled because the communication with my project team has been really good, and I haven't received any offboarding email... I sent an email to them just in case too, but I still wanted to ask.\nThank you for your answers in advance.",

First the numbers, though. \n\nThe site is now at 31k session for the last 30 days and has thereby grown by 5k monthly sessions since the last update. \n\nI won't reach my goal of 50k monthly sessions by the end of the year but at least it continues to grow.\n\nBut now on the exciting bit: I was accepted into Mediavine (kind of!). I made a few posts on Reddit, asking about ad networks tailored for tool sites.\n\nThe CEO of Mediavine eventually reached out and put me in touch with his team. \n\nThat said, I won't be onboarded onto Mediavine for now but one of their other ad networks, which is called PubNation (any experience with PubNation is greatly appreciated). \n\nAs the tool site continues to grow, so will hopefully my access to better ad products. \n\nI also hope that enabling ads will allow me to make more money on the [desktop app](https://www.terrific.tools/terrific-tools-desktop) since purchasing the license will also grant users an ad-free experience on the main website. \n\nMoreover, I also started releasing some improvements to the desktop app. I will go full-time on our other SaaS and the tool site by the end of the year, so hopefully can get those out more frequently. \n\nLastly, I [finally added Google authentication](https://x.com/onlinedopamine/status/1966209490727932397) to the tool site, which allowed me to double my signups in a month. Not sure if all of those are legit but at least I now have a growing email list I can tap into eventually. ",

      "selftext": "I've been searching on the web for a while, trying to find something I can do to gain financial stability to get to my dream goal of building a dog training facility.  I am 28f, with a few medical issues that I want to overcome.  I am passionate in training dogs, birds, cats, and overall love listening to others.  I truly love to people part of dog training.  I have 14 years of education in dog training, learning under multiple mentors. Many people have told me I need to write a book about my life and that I give great life advice because of what my medical conditions have put me through.  I feel a lot of people look up to me, though I strongly feel inadequate in that realm.  I want to blog about my journey to success.\n\nThe best thing is I have massive support to get through this, in the sense of, stable housing without needing to work, disability income (that I wish to work towards going off), and overall emotional support of my friends.  With that said, my goals are:\n\n* To build inspiration in others who are in my shoes or in similar situations.  Create guides on how to grow a business that works around their chronic illness(es).\n* Share my story in a book that encompasses life lessons I have learned along the way.\n* Eventually sell products (like t-shirts, buttons, patches) that bring awareness and possibly create a non-profit to help people in my shoes.\n* Start public speaking about my journey and how I conquered my medical conditions.\n* Eventually, **create my own dog training and boarding business** as that's my biggest passion (this has a huge startup cost, so I need a way to make the money)\n\nWith that said, my biggest setback is really just my medical conditions.  They are neurological, and after an injury, my brain struggles to learn information, but that's getting better.  I have struggled with the next steps after figuring out my goals, such as, what I need to learn to accomplish this and the basic steps to get started.  It all seems overwhelming, but I know once the ball gets rolling I will figure it all out.  My biggest inspiration is Temple Grandin. I am autistic and an extremely visual and hands on learner.\n\nAny advice, words of wisdom, or guidance would be much appreciated.",

Great advantage of yours is that you are an expert in the field and would have no problems writing content.\n\nI looked up some blogs that have success (they are in Mediavine, an advertisement company that shows media ads on your website). Take a look and see if you capable of creating content like them:\n- dogtrainingme .com\n- peachonaleash .com\n- prettyfluffy .com\n- littledogtips .com\n- bigdogmom .com\n- fidoseofreality .com\n- ottertailkennels .com\n- Dogtraining .world\n- wearwagrepeat .com\n\n\nThere are actually many more, like a good dozen more.\n\n\nAs for earning a buck from it, there are:\n1. lead generation (for dog training places?)\n2. affiliate products (leashes and stuff on amazon, amazon shares 3% in pet niche as I can see from their website https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/node/topic/GRXPHT8U84RAYDXZ)\n3. ads from companies like ezoic/mediavine/raptive. I think ads would not be the greatest income stream, more like $500 of passive income. Earnings depend on niche, pet niche doesn‚Äôt seem to bring much, may be like $8 ish per thousand. Those websites mentioned above have like 30/40/50k visitors a month if similarweb .com and ahref .com do not lie.\n\nMe myself go with 2nd and 3rd income streams. (Cause it‚Äôs inconvenient for me to work with small entrepreneurs whom I would bring leads for, cause I am living abroad and things are complicated). You on the other hand can have great success with it.\n\nWhat time period should you dedicate to it? You‚Äôll need like a year, a year and a half. And during this time all you do is constantly writing blog posts. You would write 2 posts a week on average. If you will have struggles writing content, I can explain my technic, it is soulless and mechanic, but does the job.\n\nHow many blog posts do you need? Depends on the niche and your approach, (I aim for 350-700). but let‚Äôs take your potential competition:\n- Dogtrainingme has ~530 posts\n- Peachonaleash ~50 posts (and lots of pages dedicated to events)\n- Prettyfluffy ~500 posts\n- Wearwagrepeat ~400 posts (plus 300 podcast transcripts/announcements)\n\nSo, you got the idea. You would need lots of posts. Posts‚Äô quality you can judge on your own.",

      "selftext": "ok so for context ive been doing this for about 3 years now. startups bring me in when shit hits the fan - not the \"we ran out of money\" fan, the \"our product literally cannot scale and we have no idea why\" fan\n\nand theres this pattern that shows up EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.\n\nmonth 1-6: everything is great. moving fast, shipping features, customers are happy, lifes good\n\nmonth 7-12: things start slowing down. weird bugs popping up. \"we'll fix it later\" becomes the team motto\n\nmonth 13-18: you literally cannot add a new feature without breaking 3 old ones. every deploy is stressful\n\nmonth 19-24: youve now hired 3 more engineers and theyre just maintaining the existing mess. not building anything new\n\nmonth 25+: rebuild from scratch or watch your startup die in slow motion\n\n**what i found in those 47 codebases:**\n\nlike 89% had zero database indexing. ZERO. your app is slow because youre searching through 100,000 records on every single request. thats not a bug thats just... why\n\n76% were paying for like 8x more servers than they needed. the average is 13% utilization - youre paying for 100 servers and using 13 of them. burning $3k-15k a month for nothing\n\n68% had auth vulnerabilities that would make any security person have a panic attack\n\n91% had no automated tests at all. so every new feature is literally russian roulette\n\n**the math on this is depressing:**\n\navg engineer salary is like $120k right stripe did research showing devs spend 42% of time dealing with bad code so for a team of 4 over 3 years thats $600k+ just... wasted. on maintaining garbage then add $200-400k to rebuild plus 6-12 months of lost revenue during the rebuild total damage per company: $2-3M\n\nand founders dont realize until month 18-24. by then youve raised series A based on growth that is about to completely fall apart\n\n**what actually prevents this:**\n\nhonestly just spend 2 weeks on architecture before writing code. i know its boring and you wanna ship fast but those 2 weeks save you 18 months of hell\n\nthink \"what breaks at 10,000 users\" not \"what works for 100 users\" - your db queries, file uploads, background jobs, everything needs to handle 100x day one\n\nautomate tests from the start. if you cant click one button and know nothing broke youre just gambling\n\npick boring tech. react/node/postgres is boring and thats GOOD. you can hire for it, theres stackoverflow answers, it doesnt randomly die at 2am\n\nget someone whos done this to review your architecture in WEEK ONE. not month 12 when its too late\n\n**the part nobody wants to hear:**\n\nmost technical cofounders and first eng hires are really good at coding but have never architected something that scales. its like being a great cook but never running a restaurant kitchen during dinner rush\n\nreal example from last month - saas company spending $47k/month on aws\n\ni did a 3 day review and found:\n\n* running 40 servers when they needed 6\n* storing files in literally the most expensive way possible\n* db queries taking 4 seconds that should take 40 milliseconds\n\nnew bill: $8,200/month\n\nthey saved $38,800 PER MONTH. thats $465k a year. for 3 days of work.\n\n**why im posting this**\n\nbecause im tired of watching founders burn 18 months and $500k-2M learning lessons that are completely avoidable\n\n\"move fast break things\" works when youre facebook with unlimited money. for your startup its just suicide\n\n**if youre building something right now ask yourself:**\n\n* what breaks at 10x current users?\n* do you have automated tests?\n* can your db handle 100x the queries?\n* would your infrastructure cost $50k/month at 10k users?\n\nif you said \"i dont know\" to any of these youre building on quicksand\n\nhappy to answer questions about tech stack or architecture stuff in comments. ive seen this movie too many times. \n\nMeir Avimelec Davidov (You can search me over linkedin)  \nFounder &amp; CEO of gliltech software",

Spend that time shipping in the early days.\n\nAs you start to get traffic and PMF is when you ramp your tech debt work. You work up to a baseline level of tech debt improvement so that it helps you continue to scale and you don‚Äôt skip a clear improvement in order to ship a week faster: you take the time to do it right (to your current scale).\n\nIf you stay flexible in your software design during this process, you‚Äôll never get caught out by tech debt cause you‚Äôll always be iteratively improving.",

Even our team shortened it to \"c2t\" in calls because nobody wanted to say the full thing.\n\nFor my next project, Linkedin content AI tool, I went radically short: 2pr\n\nHere's what happened. When you give an extremly short and meaningless name, people instinctively add the domain when they mention it. They say \"2pr\\[.\\]io\" instead of just \"2pr\" because saying just \"2pr\" sounds awkward or unclear. (hopefully moderators will get that is not a link but core feature of the post/story)\n\nThat becomes a clickable hyperlink automatically.\n\nMost of our signups come from direct links now. People share the name in Slack channels, LinkedIn comments, Reddit threads. Word-of-mouth converts into clickable links without any extra effort.\n\nMade $4500 last month and a 80% of that came from people just dropping the name in conversations.\n\nIf you're venture-backed with a marketing budget, you probably want a memorable brand name like Mistral or Clay.\n\nBut if you're bootstrapping and need scrappy distribution, super short plus meaningless might actually be a hack.\n\nGeniunly, I can't understand why this growth hack idea is not so widely cited or shared",

All without needing me to handhold her and she knew she didn't have time to wait for my permission but she also knew the show wouldn't happen without it. \n\nSo we worked on her weaknesses and I spent extra time training her and eventually just started hiring sales people to work under her because the amount of peace of mind I had with her was still worth it.",

Keeping them around, in most cases, does more harm than good.  Obv, There might be exceptions where someone is the social glue for an business, not toxic, well liked and respected (cheap enough) but not able to actually produce work up to snuff (just saying, that type of situation could happen).",

Sure, you can go code your own custom apps -- but you will save time and get a better result if you go with the leading apps in your space. Same thing with accounting, and other professional services.\n\nWith digital marketing, I'm sure you have clients that DIY their marketing, but once they hire an agency they experience better results.\n\nAn accounting platform such as QBO is good if you want to DIY.

But I would say absolutely not everyone should have cards, and every charge should be authorized by someone who is looking at the transactions every month. You can then categorize things like how much should we spend on software, how much did we spend on business meals, how much did we spend on advertising dollars, and then you can see where you need to watch out. This also will help you with your taxes. \n\nOnce you get into a groove, most expenses should be predictable and recurring. This is actually a great use for AI. You can export your transactions and create a project for expense review. For example you have a long list including things like:\n\nAsana\nEverhour\nGoogle Workspace\nSEMRush\nSupermetrics \n\nSo you tell the GPT what to expect and what‚Äôs normal, and then every month you upload it and say tell me what charges are out of the ordinary and anything that‚Äôs changing, something like that.",

There's two options if you have teams now, each having a line manager and person of responsibility then they coordinate costs for their team. \n\nIf you don't have that get an office manager that organises all this.\n\nAll cost approvals go through her and up to you both for what they deems required. I.e. under ¬£500 or something they sort above goes to you.\n\nThey can also sort and organise all subscriptions, training etc etc so that you know everything you're subscribed to, cost, expiry in one place.\n\nAt the end of the financial year you both need to go through the expenses to make sure there are no bullshit claims with your accountant.",

I asked a lot of questions to salon owners especially how to build a clientele. Little by little I did and said what they did. I made each person feel special, heard, and tried to really listen to their stories. I wrote down their name, number, and notes about them. Before they came in to their next appt, I reviewed my notes. Little by little I grew my clientele. Eventually I was able to rent a chair. Eventually I moved salons to a busier location. After a three years, in 1994, I opened a shop that was less than 500 sq ft. Had a business partner, my boyfriend and later got married. 1.5 years later expanded to 1100sq ft. 14 years later, 2006 we sold the shop and moved out of the country. 2000 we broke ground and build a resort in Greece. In 2007 moved back and rebuilt in a nearby neighborhood of our original location where clients can find us again. We continued to build the resort abroad. 2008 the housing crisis hurt the business. We shifted from having employees to transitioning them to rental stylists. 2016 our marriage suffered. 2018 we closed the shop, divorced and I went on my own to continue to grow and shift the business model. He kept the resort. 2021 I shifted again, became mobile and added on more services as a professional organizer. Staying flexible, resilient and responsive to changes helped me sustain myself for now over 30 years.",

Companies are looking for a stable firm that they know they can trust many years into the future.   \n2. Sounds like you are struggling to articulate value for the prospects and that takes time to develop. But start with what you have delivered in the past and spin it into what you can deliver in the future.   \n3. First step is to find the first client and often that will happen from a referral from a friend. Reach out to your friends in the industry asking them to help you get introduced. Often the personal referral from a trusted source is enough to get you started.   \nBest wishes",

In person networking - most b2b sales will come because of a referral, and doing in person networking.  Our first client actually came from a referral for a man I had helped 2 years earlier.  He had me on his email list so I decided to reach back out to him and share with him what we were offering, quickly saw the value and connected me with several of his clients which all signed on to our services.  We then started attending different networking groups.  The key here is that not a ton of direct sales happen from in person networking.  What happens is you build your referral base from networking and then they refer clients to you.  \n\n2. We read some books that showed us our marketing message was so good. Specifically Story Branding and Star with Why.  They helped so much.  Once we realized our messaging was wrong and updated it we started getting more and more traction from our networking.  \n\nI think most ppl ignore in person networking bc they are building an ‚Äúonline business‚Äù but if you are doing 2b2 it‚Äôs so key!",

People want to do business with people they know and trust. \n\nStart thinking about specific challenges you are uniquely good at solving that matter most to your buyers. You are selling solutions to their problems, and outcomes, not services and just skills. Ideally, this varies per industry target, per lead source, per partnership type. For example: AI, data management, and security are massive points of interest to most companies- think about how and who you help most to enable those related challenges, costs, or risks.\n\nOther leads and sources would be IT conferences, or any networking events that your buyers and stakeholders would attend.

It's difficult to do on your own, I had the support of organisation and other staff, management etc.  This is because you have an idea that it is the sales side but still not sure because of lack of experience.  Thus the learning curve that takes at least 3 months speaking to 20 people a day to even get one sale can be especially daunting. \n\nfind other ways to get leads, marketing and advertising.  But when the leads come in, you still have to sell.  And if you haven't got the skill you might waste quite a few marketing dollars. It most likely will take 3 months to get your first sale.

It's frustrating when you know you can deliver but can't get the first conversation. Your expertise isn't the issue, it's how you position it to your clients.\n\nHere's my take:\n\n1. Reframe from IT consultant to Problem Solver. Talking about data center and enterprise networking to small business owners sounds expensive and complex. They just want to know if your solutions can make their internet faster, stop their system from crashing etc. Repackage your offer around their core anxieties like reliability, security and simplicity.\n2. Stop Cold Calling and Start Building Trust. Cold calling is like charging a fortified wall without intelligence, it rarely works unless you are a sales prodigy. Instead, provide value first. Offer a free, simple network check-up or be the helpful person in the online forums and local business groups who answers IT questions. Don't sell, just help. Let them see you as an Ally.\n3. Find Partners, not just Clients. Your fastest path to clients is through partnerships. Reach out to Managed Service Providers, web developers or cybersecurity firms. They already have the trust of your target clients and often run into projects that are too complex for them, which is what you solve. propose a referral partnership.\n\nYou have the expertise. Now it's about layering on the trust and positioning. Once you are a trusted voice, your clients will come.\n\n(Source: I guide leaders on market engagement and write about these principles in \"The Strategic Treatise\", I will be starting a weekly \"Insight First Clinic\" on Reddit to break down problems like this.)",

          "body": "Cold calling local clinics for data center and enterprise networking services is completely misaligned. Small clinics don't need connectivity and infrastructure design at enterprise scale. You're pitching high-end services to businesses that probably just need basic IT support.\n\nOur clients in IT consulting learned that enterprise networking clients aren't found through cold calls to random small businesses. They come from referrals, partnerships with MSPs who need specialist help, or targeting mid-sized companies actually doing infrastructure projects.\n\nData center and cloud infrastructure work goes to companies with 100 plus employees, serious tech budgets, and existing IT teams. Those deals come through warm intros, industry connections, or subcontracting with bigger consulting firms. Not cold calling dentist offices.\n\nIf you want small business clients, pivot your services. Offer managed IT support, cybersecurity assessments, cloud migrations for Office 365. That's what SMBs actually pay for. The enterprise networking stuff you're good at is overkill for their needs.\n\nBetter approach is partner with IT service providers who already work with your target clients. Offer to handle their complex networking projects when they need specialist help. You get clients, they get to serve their customers better without hiring full-time network engineers.\n\nJoin local tech groups, attend industry meetups, get to know other IT consultants and MSPs. Referrals and partnerships are how consulting businesses actually grow, not cold outreach to businesses who don't need what you're selling.\n\nFour months with zero traction means your targeting is wrong, not that you suck at sales. Fix who you're talking to before you worry about how you're talking to them.",

      "selftext": "Six months ago, I posted something that garnered a couple of dozen views. ‚ÄúCool,‚Äù I thought, and decided to try running my account with no content plan and no strategy. I just wanted to share my thoughts. Later, it turned into a tool for building my reputation, and now I‚Äôm not even sure: am I running LinkedIn, or is LinkedIn running me? :)\n\nToday, I‚Äôve gathered some numbers, results, and fun facts, and answered some of my followers‚Äô questions.\n\nDo recruiters and HR people reach out? No, not really. And that was my plan. Here‚Äôs why: I‚Äôm not job-hunting and don‚Äôt position myself as a candidate. I‚Äôm building the reputation of a strong marketer and an engaging storyteller. I think that protects me from offers I‚Äôm overqualified for or simply uninterested in. That said, I have received several great inquiries, ones definitely worth attention, for senior roles, mid-level positions, and personal brand management.\n\nI just write about what interests me. My topics depend on that. If my interests change, maybe my ‚Äústrategy‚Äù will too. Probably more about work, since now I have one.\n\nDid I find a job? I did. I‚Äôm not sure LinkedIn directly helped, but thanks to it, I‚Äôve had side gigs that have totaled about $1,000. That wasn‚Äôt my goal, though.\n\nI didn‚Äôt expect such rapid growth or to reach such high numbers. So far, I‚Äôm satisfied :)\n\nI‚Äôve garnered 3.6 million impressions, gained over 7,000 followers, and written 270 posts, averaging 128 reactions and 30 comments.\n\nOverall impression, I like it. I‚Äôm grateful to the people who read me. It makes me happy, and I encourage everyone who enjoys writing to just keep doing it, even if your reach isn‚Äôt impressive yet.",

The $1K in side gigs is the weak signal everyone ignores. Those aren't random offers. They're trust conversions from lurkers who watched your consistency for months. Your real asset isn't 7K followers. It's the invisible attention inventory you've built with champions who haven't DM'd yet. That converts at 10x when you actually need something.

I've seen teams burn $2-3K/mo on GPT-4 calls before realizing they could cache 80% of responses or downgrade to 3.5 for non-critical queries. The profitable AI businesses I've tracked share one pattern: they didn't start as AI companies, they added AI to solve a specific bottleneck in an existing workflow (driver routing, product descriptions, lead personalization). The ones that launched as 'AI startups' without a clear use case usually pivot or die within 6 months. On pricing: the successful ones charge for outcomes or time saved, not per AI call. If you're pricing per generation or query, your margins get crushed every time OpenAI raises prices. Better to package it as 'unlimited X for $Y/month' and manage your own cost efficiency internally.",

Can you give me actionable instructions on how I can escape it too?\n\nI'll give you details about a couple of things I've done to change my circumstances and my current environment.\n\nI put a TON of effort into learning software development. I know how to build apps and websites. I have built a lot of apps and websites. Some use ads to earn money. Some require payment but my main problem is no one knows about the things I've built because I can't afford to pay for advertisement. I have posted details about the things I've built in startup drectories but that didn't help much.\n\nI got a degree in Electronic Engineering and a Masters in Computer Science but then realized that... There are no jobs in my country. That is not a joke. I wrote an app to automate the process of applying to jobs and now I agree with my peers in my country that no one is hiring.\n\nI don't have rich relatives I can get investment money from.\n\nI have tried getting work on upwork and freelancer but they expect me to pay to get work.\n\nI'm considering joining the army, though I'm afraid I might not have the heart to kill a fellow human.\n\nSo... What would you do if you were in my shoes. How would you change your circumstances?",

Cursor has agents that can help you do many things inside your computer, and even use dictation.\n\nAll you need is to give it enough context, and it does a lot.",

I want a skill that not only makes money now but also has room to grow and good future prospects.\n\nI‚Äôm torn between three paths:\n\t1.\tBuilding specialized AI tools for businesses, seems super high potential and future-proof, but also complicated to learn. Could pay really well once you get the hang of it.\n2.\tData analytics + dashboards \n3.\tAI-powered marketing.\n\nI can put in the work, so it‚Äôs really about picking the one that‚Äôs worth it long-term and can scale in the future.\n\nIf you were in my shoes and had to pick one to focus on for a year to build real earning potential, which would you go for and why?",

I wished i had such clarity back then.\n\nThat said, if i had to choose: Build Specialized AI tools.\n\nWhy? It‚Äôs a Product, Not a Service. meaning you can build a product and sell it multiple times.\n\nit‚Äôs hard to copy. which gives you a defensive moat (high barrier of entry).\n\nyou can start off on your own first and later scale to a Saas company without limiting you to hourly work.\n\nLearning to build specialized AI tools also forces you to learn the other 2. (i started learning python and data analytics before going into machine learning and now building AI mentor) you will also future proof your career at a foundational level where you start building system at an architectural level. \n\nif your putting in 3600 hrs, here‚Äôs the training roadmap - \n\nmonth 1-4, Foundations consist of python, sql, APIs and core AI frameworks. build simple projects to learn. \n\nmonth 5-8, specialization. pick one high value and boring problem that businesses face. build a very specific tool for it. \n\nmonth 9-12. find 10 businesses to offer free AI tools to gather feedback. reiterate the tool till it becomes essential to the business. then start charging for it. \n\ndata analytics and dashboard is starting to become a commodity (if not already) AI will automate reporting so the key is to create tools that will produce insight rather than reporting. ai for marketing means you are probably specializing on other‚Äôs platform. which means less control in algorithm, upgrades and cost. \n\nso my take is building specialized tools for businesses. \n\n(source: i guide leaders on strategic engagement and write about principles like this in ‚ÄúThe Strategic Treatise ‚Äú i will be running an Insight First clinic on reddit for deeper dives)",

Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs AI tools, dashboards, or marketing automation, what pays is the *ability to identify a problem and ship a working solution*.\n\nIf you go all in on AI tools, you‚Äôll learn both **data** and **marketing** naturally along the way. Because you‚Äôll need to find problems, validate them, build, and sell.  \nSo instead of thinking **which skill?,** think **‚Äúwhich ecosystem do I want to dominate?‚Äù**\n\nIf I were you, I‚Äôd pick AI tools for businesses. It‚Äôs tough, but if you can build one real solution that saves companies time or money, you‚Äôre set for years.\n\nStart by building micro-tools ‚Üí get feedback ‚Üí improve ‚Üí charge ‚Üí scale.  \nIn a year, you‚Äôll be dangerous.\n\nCurious though, what kind of businesses are you thinking about targeting?

Open a store and think of ways to sell. This is how you learn to fail but this is also how you succeed. If that didn‚Äôt make you stop, it‚Äôs a good sign. Good luck !",

          "body": "The 3 paths are intertwined.\n\nHard to give specific advice here but for brainstorming purposes:\n\nOne idea could be:\n\n1. Local Market Research to find out the workflows, pains and also how they use AI. Google/Talk to AI, find indirect competitors in other markets /global ones that you can copy.\n2. TODO: Analyze a specific local industry (Country/Language). Focus: Which questions should I ask myself?\n3. Call the companies and ask them a series of questions followed by asking them if they would pay for it.\n4. Also ask if it is OK for them if you add them to your CRM-system and contact them when the product is live\n5. By doing this you get a CRM-database with potential customers\n6. Develop the easiest first solution.\n7. Email them and offer them a demo or to test the software.\n8. This makes them feel \"ownership\" over this idea.\n9. This build trusts and you can either deliver the next product or ask them: Would you like this too?\n10. Potentially, with enough trust, and recurring business you could ask for money to develop the issue (Retainer/targeted customer funding).\n\n\\---\n\nMake sure you do versions of the business documents for your project and make new ones until you feel you are ready. Which ones are important?\n\nFor any AI-driven development: What documents should you have finished first, which could be included as skeleton files for the AI to populate.\n\nIf you use AI for help with documents make sure you have a system in place for organization of files.  \nEither do this locally on your computer, with drive or with Notion.\n\nCareful: Making a decision for part in a doc, might require you to change a lot of other docs.  \nMake sure you have your documents mapped out to know how they relate to eachother.   \nThis will help you.",

          "body": "I think I have the best advice of all- don't reinvent the wheel. The best money are in problems that will always exist no matter what. As we see with the news today, you'll want to create a recession proof business  that will ALWAYS be needed and you can't be laid off from. Think laundrymats, plumbing, HVAC, electrician, UPS stores, etc. These are all things that except for a zombie apocalypse will always be needed. For example, I chose nursing as my career because as long as humanity lives, I'll always have a job, and it's a diverse and scalable field. I would say pick something like that, take an apprenticeship, work your way up and eventually open your own business. I would avoid AI only because the market is changing so fast, it may be difficult keeping updated when self-taught. Don't focus on lots of money fast, PLEASE focus on **sustainability**. Think of the tech startup boom from a few years back and how many people today are laid off.  People have to have clean clothes, lights, working drains, etc. whether the market is up or down. Over the long run of your life, constant, steady, stable and infallible income will bring you more money, and ultimately PEACE OF MIND (as you age, you will realize that this/work-life balance is worth more than anything. Your body/mind won't be 19 forever) than quick fads ever will. Hope this helps!",

Standard stuff like lawn maintenance, seasonal cleanups, mulching, the usual.\n\nAbout 8 months ago I had this one client who kept asking if I could pressure wash their driveway while I was already there doing their yard. I said sure whatever, charged them like $75 extra just to not deal with scheduling another visit. Took me maybe 30 mins.\n\nWord got around I guess because then other clients started asking. I figured why not, easy add on right? Fast forward to now and I'm getting calls specifically for pressure washing. Like people don't even want the landscaping part anymore they just want their driveways, decks, house siding done.\n\nDid the math last week and the pressure washing stuff brought in almost double what the landscaping did last month. I've got some money saved up from the busy season so I could buy better equipment and actually pivot to this full time but it feels weird abandoning what I started with?\n\nAnyone else deal with something like this where a side thing accidentally became the main thing? Do I just roll with it or am I overthinking this",

I offered him a side of fries instead, but he lost his temper and started cussing at me. He claimed I was 'full of shit' and that I had plenty of product, which wasn't true.\n\nAs the owner, I'm used to dealing with difficult customers, but this guy's behavior was unacceptable. I yelled at him to leave and told him not to come back.\n\nI know some of you might think I'm a jerk for cutting him off, but honestly, I feel like he took advantage of my kindness for too long.

But we're known for our produce (and we're also a SNAP retailer) so it's a necessity. Produce has different phases: A Grade, B Grade, Free Grade, Piggy Grade, and Compost. We don't have enough B Grade to warrant a trip out to a food rescue organization so we started a \"free table\" where we would put unsellable but still edible produce and other items. Folks from all tax brackets would take from the free table but most importantly: food insecure folks could take from it without having to feel awkward about it.\n\nWell this one unhoused guy decided it was his personal buffet and would eat from it all day. I started offering him bags to take anything he wanted to go. He decided that outside of our store was his home. He would try to come in after closing hours to ask for more free food. One time, I was working from inside the locked store (lights were off and blinds were down) and I felt someone staring at me. I looked up and he was bent down so he could stare at me from under the blinds. That was the first time I called the cops.\n\nWe stopped putting out the free produce for a while because he creeped us out so much (for a multitude of reasons). Customers expressed disappointment so when we hadn't seen the creeper for a long while, we decided to bring it back. Well then creeper man got out of jail and resumed his antics. I was setting up the table and ran into him and we had a nice conversation where he seemed sober + thanked me for feeding him. I offered him a to go bag and he informed me that he was planning on hanging out because he likes it in front of my store. I very politely gave a reason for why he should hang out in one of the more comfortable spots in the area and he went ballistic. I tried to deescalate the situation and he threatened to kill me. I called the cops again, got a different officer, who informed me that sometimes people say things they don't mean.\n\nSince the cops don't care about the safety of my team + my neighbors, the free table is gone permanently and the good free stuff goes to the unhoused people in the neighborhood who periodically check in on us to make sure creeper man hasn't been bothering us.",

Half the receipts get lost, nobody remembers what category things belong to, and by the time I match everything, the month‚Äôs already over.

I‚Äôm not sure if it offers a free version since we use the paid plan, it‚Äôs helped us so much for managing receipts. Here‚Äôs how it works: you creat categories I.e Starbucks and add your team members to the platform. Each team member is then assigned a unique email address, for example, johndoe-[companyname]@dext.cc. \n\nWhenever they have a receipt, they simply email a photo of it to their specific Dext address. The system automatically identifies which employee submitted it and organizes the receipts into the categories you initially set up.\n\nHope this helps :)",

Not looking for any more comments, sales pitches or people telling me to work harder and cold call business.\n\nAnswers to the so so so many comments about exactly the same things....\n\n1) we are residential cleaning  \n2) it's a lead gen business not a direct cleaning company. But we respect our cleaning contractors, pay them well and support them properly \n3) we have great retention of contractors so stop telling me I'm a shit leader.\n4) yes we have recurring customers 90% of our bookings are weekly/fortnightly \n5) no I don't work 1 hr a day. That's just for the moment while I have a newborn child. When i can get more than a 2 hr block of sleep before having to change a nappy or support my wife breast feeding I'll go back to 60 hr weeks\n\nNow back to the original post so you can all roast me even more\n\n============\n\nI've been running a semi successful cleaning business for 10 years.\n\nHave stagnanted at $300k annual revenue but have really struggled to get past that level.\n\nLast 18 months we've fallen in to Google's dislike pile and have been loosing traffic month over month.\n\nTried fixing things but got on the bad side of the June/July core update and out traffic has almost zeroed out \n\nGoing from 800 organic clicks per day 18 months ago to 10 per day now.\n\nHad a couple contractor teams leave. Latest one is going for surgery due to cancer in a week.\n\nJust had my first child a month ago.\n\nAnd I think I'm fucked. \n\nI can't recruit new teams unless I get the bookings. And I can't get the bookings unless I spend money on marketing. And I don't have money unless I get bookings.\n\nI've spent over $100,000 on SEO \"agencies\" that were essentially BS.\n\nGAds is way different now that it was 8 yrs ago.\n\nI've spent $20k on GAds in the last 6 months and made about $10k from those ads.\n\nAnd this contractor leaving us for cancer surgery makes me think I don't actually have a business anymore.\n\nAm I stuck in sink cost fallacy? Do I actually have a business at all? What do I do if 10yrs experience turns to shit?\n\nI need to voice this out loud and don't want to speak to my wife about it. \n\nNot sure what I'm looking for. Maybe I just need to vent.\n\nEdit: in Australia not US",

Cold call, yes every body hate it but if you have a good marketing employee the price of the lead is very low much lower than any other marketing cost.\n\nC. You need to talk with your client's and see what they like and not like on your service and if they really like your service offer them commission on each new client they send your way.\nMouth to ear is the best marketing but is take a lot of work to do",

Which make just be too expensive of customer acquisition cost. I think you‚Äôre cooked tbh, as far as growth. \n\nThe changes to the SEO probably killed your whole current growth model. You were likely able to really maximize the bang for your buck under the old structure, and no one except google is going to know for sure why it changed and/or what you can do about it.\n\nYou would not be at all the first to have this problem after a major update. Any time this happens, some companies get crushed. It might be possible to recover, but also possible you just had the perfect mix of whatever factors mattered. As time goes on, people will know better, but then as more people know, they‚Äôll change it again. \n\nSo you can keep spending money on SEO and consultants, but you‚Äôll probably just burn it all. I know there‚Äôs going to be some consulting firm out there that actually has a very good idea of what the changes are, but that‚Äôs going to be impossible to truly determine you‚Äôre going with the right one, except doing it and seeing the results.\n\nSo just comes down to how much money you want to gamble. Could work, could not. \n\nIf your risk tolerance is low, I‚Äôd look at selling your business based on the value of the brand / customer relationships. For all you know some actual large cleaning company might want to buy it, and do the actual cleaning themselves. So they‚Äôd essentially be buying your customers off you in that case, which likely has some value.",

Hopefully that kickstarts their ass into gear and they just pay it to keep it from going any further. But if they continue to ignore it or delay payment, file a lawsuit. It's relatively inexpensive and easy if you do it yourself. And then, again, hopefully *that* kickstarts their ass into gear and they just pay it or offer to settle to keep it from escalating to court. If they still won't pay, then it's time to go to court, and for that you need an actual lawyer. You could try to represent yourself but generally that's not a great idea, but if you do hire a lawyer you should know you're probably going to pay as much (if not more) than you recover from the client. If you try to represent yourself, you could potentially recover a lot more of the money for yourself but you're also more likely to lose.\n\nThey probably have limited cash with which to pay their vendors right now. The squeakiest wheel gets the grease first, and right now you're not one of their squeakiest wheels. In other words, they're only paying the bills that are causing them the biggest problems right now. And you're not one of them.

Only $14k, I would expect so, but if not, it might not be worth the bother because you could get a settlement and not be able to collect anything.  If Yes to both 1 and 2, then hand it off to an attorney to go after them for the $14k plus costs.  If No to 1, but Yes, to 2, then you just gotta make a judgement call.  I'd figure legal expenses would be $5k minimum if it ends up actually going to court.  You could probably get away with less if a lawyer's demand letter or the court filing itself is enough to get them to pay up.  I think it's worth doing, but you have to understand that you might be throwing good money after bad.  Court is always an expensive gamble.\n\nMost deadbeats will pay up once you actually file in court.  Some will just ignore it, never respond, and never show up at court.  Still others will fight you to the absolute bitter end even if they have little hope of victory.  A-holes gonna A-hole.",

          "body": "Yes! Leadership in general is a muscle that needs to grow in the beginning but firing is always hard. My mentor always said the day firing is easy is the day you shouldn't be a leader. You need to make the right decision for your business but it's not easy knowing that person is losing their job. Especially in a small business, you more than likely know their family or at least know about them.  We should always maintain our compassion.\n\nThis is probably my driving force behind hiring very carefully, because I haaaate terminating. I like using interview guides with predetermined questions and 1-3 answer ratings so I'm very clear on who I need to hire and my notes are the data to back them up. I like pretty much everyone when I meet them and the interview is the best you're going to get.  I never hire on the spot and typically try to have someone else I trust in the interview for additional perspective.  I always give myself time after the interview to really think through their answers.\n\nI have seen so many things go wrong when clients wait to fire too. They put it off and every single time, it ends in a dumpster fire. Property damage, reputation with vendors or customers destroyed, workmans comp injuries- I've heard/witnessed some wild stories. \n\nKeep performance notes so you can make an educated decision and have regular performance conversations with your employees so it's not a surprise. This also keeps your top employees happy because seeing poor behavior or poor performance tolerated will demotivate them right out the door.",

If your relationship is good, there's no reason why it should get worse when you start working together :)\n\nThe most difficult part is probably dividing work from personal life. If you don't pay attention, you might end up discussing work all the time (it's very easy when you live together) and leaving aside the \"romantic\" part of your relationship.\n\nI think you should definitely try it out with your partner!

          "body": "Three years stuck at the same revenue means you've got a retention problem, not an acquisition problem. You're churning customers as fast as you're bringing them in, which means either your product isn't sticky enough or you're targeting the wrong people.\n\nWellness products need repeat purchases to grow. If customers buy once and disappear, you don't have a business, you just have expensive one-time transactions. Our clients in wellness who broke through this plateau focused obsessively on getting customers to buy 2-3 times, not just converting new people.\n\nYour online sales dropping 30% from peak is a red flag. That's not normal fluctuation, something changed. Did you stop doing what was working? Did ad costs spike? Did a competitor launch? You need to diagnose what actually caused that drop instead of just accepting it.\n\nReleasing new products when your existing ones aren't retaining customers is just spreading yourself thinner. Fix retention on what you already have before you add complexity. Get your current customers buying more frequently or in higher amounts.\n\nThe storefront gives you an advantage most online wellness brands don't have. Use it to build real relationships with local customers who become regulars. Those people should be your core base that stabilizes revenue even when online fluctuates.\n\nFor breaking past $200k, you need either way better retention so your customer base actually grows instead of staying flat, or you need to increase average order value so the same number of customers generate more revenue. Pick one and focus there for 6 months.\n\nCheck your numbers honestly. What's your repeat purchase rate? If it's under 30%, that's your problem. What's your customer lifetime value? If people only buy once for $50, you can't profitably scale. Fix those fundamentals before you worry about growth tactics.",

The city rejected it instantly. They had a hyper-specific height and distance code for the type of sign I chose that I completely missed. The sign was illegal.\n3. **The True 'DIY' Cost:** I had to pay the original manufacturer another **$4,000** to completely tear down, re-fabricate a smaller sign, and expedite the new process. This was on top of the original $3,000 I already spent.\n\n**The Final Bill:** My $3,000 sign ended up costing me $7,000 (plus a 6-week delay to my grand opening).\n\n  \n**THE LESSON I WISH I'D LEARNED:**\n\n* The fabrication cost is the *least* complicated part. The $2,700 for the permit and install management was cheap insurance.\n* **That money isn't just for labor; it‚Äôs for expertise.** A national provider knows the thousands of different local codes across the U.S. and designs the sign to meet your permit requirements *before* production even starts.\n\nIf you are buying anything custom that needs city approval, **pay the full-service fee.** It‚Äôs the easiest $2,700 you'll ever spend. Learn from my mistake!\n\nWhat other hidden costs or required permits did you guys accidentally skip that came back to haunt you?\"",

Most sign companies, when applying for a permit on behalf of the customer, won‚Äôt begin production until the permit is officially approved. Even with plenty of experience navigating local regulations, I‚Äôve still run into situations where a permit gets denied because of some strange interpretation of the rules by someone in the permitting office. Even when the permit office is mistaken, it can take weeks or months to get things sorted out. I've even had some customers who had to hire a lawyer to sue the town over how they interpret the rules.  I know of two towns with nearly identical sign codes that interpret and enforce them completely differently. In one town, the permit office won‚Äôt approve a sign permit until every other required permit is approved first. So even for those of us who deal with sign permitting regularly, the process can still be confusing.",

His failure to meet your deadline doesn‚Äôt mean you should be bending over backwards now to meet his. \n\nFamily business is a tax office/business consulting firm, doing accounting and payroll. We tell folks to have docs in 5 days before an IRS deadline or it‚Äôs an automatic extension or late filing. If they get the documents in after our deadline, we do the extension and then do the tax return the week after the deadline. We can‚Äôt do ‚Äúlast minute‚Äù work for every client. \n\nNow, doing payroll and bookkeeping/accounting has generally helped tremendously. I‚Äôve got access to a bunch of their tax documents ahead of time and now don‚Äôt have to wait for their P+L, W2, whatever. Firm is up to ~250 clients, 40% of that growth over the last two years. Remember, CPA‚Äôs are aging out and retiring, while new grads aren‚Äôt meeting those numbers. BLS estimates ~110-120k retiring and 30-40k entering. Finding new clients will be super easy. Tell your existing clients they‚Äôll get 10% off if they bring you a new client. We only take referrals, zero advertising. \n\nThe other thing that‚Äôs been a huge help is doing the business consulting piece and helping people do their AOI, EIN, 2553, etc filings. We now have a client from the start, set them up on QB, price out basic bookkeeping services at $75/month, and we tell them to let us know when they‚Äôre ready for payroll. They now bring us their business tax return, personal tax return, parent/sibling/neighbor tax return, then these new business owners go to some networking event to push their business and tell the other new business owner about how our service got them up and running inside of two weeks. Now we get another phone call and help close out the other business owner‚Äôs 2553, QB setup, then get their business tax return, personal tax return, sibling‚Äôs tax return‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs quite easy.\n\nDM if you‚Äôd like.

      "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI am the owner of a drive-thru fast food restaurant in Australia situated on one of the busiest roadways. While our financial performance appears to be satisfactory on paper and operationally, we continue to incur a monthly loss of approximately $16,000.\n\nOur weekly sales exceed $45,000, with a gross profit margin of approximately 64% and a wage expense of 28%. However, the primary contributor to our financial challenges is the substantial amount we allocate to delivery aggregators. This month, despite a total sales of $237,000 (representing five weeks according to the retail calendar), we incurred approximately $37,000 in payments to Uber and DoorDash.\n\nDespite these substantial sales figures, we persist in operating at a loss. Given our limited capacity as a franchise, what strategies can I implement to improve our financial situation? \n\nEdit: Another problem is, I have a gym next door and we have a shared drive-way with them. The gym customers take all the parking spots, even they park on the driveway. This makes it extremely difficult for drivers to-thru customers. My google review is full with people cursing gym folks for their bad parking practices. I get only 400 cars per week in my drive-thru as opposed to 1700 in a drive-thru of another store situated in quieter road than mine. ",

Offer a small discount for direct orders (still cheaper than 28% commission).\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Delivery zone optimization\\*\\* - Are you delivering too far? Tightening your radius can cut delivery times and costs. Most customers order within 3km anyway.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Minimum order value\\*\\* - If you're not already doing this, set minimums that make the economics work. Better to lose a $15 order than subsidize it.\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Ghost kitchen model\\*\\* - Some franchises are shifting to delivery-only locations with lower overhead. Could you test a smaller, cheaper location for delivery orders only?\n\n\n\n5. \\*\\*Negotiate with aggregators\\*\\* - At your volume, you have leverage. Many will reduce commission if you commit to exclusivity or higher volume.\n\n\n\nThe real question: What's your customer acquisition cost through aggregators vs other channels? If they're bringing NEW customers who become regulars, the fee might be worth it short-term.\n\n\n\nWhat's your current split between aggregator orders vs direct orders?",

The brutal math here is that youre paying roughly 15.6% of total revenue just to delivery aggregators, which when combined with your 28% labor costs is eating up almost half your gross profit before you even touch rent, utilities, or other overhead. What most franchise owners dont realize is that you can actually negotiate better rates with these platforms once you hit certain volume thresholds, plus theres consolidation software that can help manage multiple platform orders through one system so you dont miss orders during peak times. At vGrubs we work with restaurants to aggregate all their delivery platforms into one dashboard and help optimize their delivery operations to actually turn those orders profitable instead of just break-even customer acquisition tools.\n\nThe parking situation is probably costing you way more than the delivery fees though since drive-thru customers typically have much higher profit margins than delivery orders.",

We work with tons of restaurants at Kea AI and that 15-16% you're paying to delivery platforms is just insane when you're already operating on thin margins. The math just doesn't work for most places.\n\nHere's what I've seen work for similar situations. First, you gotta start building your own direct ordering channel aggressively. Since you're on a busy roadway with good drive-thru traffic, focus on converting those customers to order direct next time. Simple stuff like receipt inserts with a discount code for direct orders, or even just training staff to mention \"next time you can skip the wait and order ahead on our app.\" The goal is getting people off those expensive platforms gradually.\n\nSecond thing is optimizing your phone orders since thats free revenue. Make sure every call gets answered professionally because missed calls during lunch rush are literally money walking away. A lot of places lose thousands just from unanswered phones when they're busy. Even something as simple as a proper phone system that queues calls instead of going to voicemail can help capture more of that direct business.\n\nThe delivery platforms aren't going anywhere but you dont have to be completely dependent on them. Start tracking what percentage of your sales come from each channel and set a goal to reduce that delivery platform percentage by even 5% over the next few months. With your volume that could save you almost $1000 monthly. Small changes add up fast when you're doing $45k+ weekly.",

I previously managed a business with 60% sales via delivery partners, which resulted in a 22% fee. Consider ways to improve sales, such as extending trading hours. Additionally, discuss with the gym staff to address the drive-through issue. I would also suggest reducing your labour costs to 23‚Äì25%. Evaluate your current sales and determine if you can increase them while employing more junior staff to reduce labour rates. Finally, negotiate your royalty and marketing fees, which I believe are also approximately 10%.  \n\nRegarding gross profit, I believe your cost of goods sold is 36%, This figure appears unusually high.

Venting to folks in my industry isn't the same.  \n  \n**Original post:** My business has solid 7 figure revenue. Profitable. Niche service/product. Little to no competition. I have tried many ways to delegate and remove myself from day to day front of the line, but it's become clear after many years of doing this and trying to delegate, that the secret sauce is me, which can't be delegated/scaled, regardless of what various business \"experts\" will claim.\n\nI guess I feel this is a bit like telling some awesome musician that they need to teach others to do what they can do so that they can take time away. Won't work. They are the secret sauce. Without them, their band/offering is not close to what it is with them.\n\nMy business sells something that is not sold and done (like a pizza, you sell it, someone eats it, and then they don't come back a year later asking for tips on how to eat their pizza). My business sells something that can literally have years of ongoing support and hand holding. The latter part is really what is sucking the soul out of me. To use the pizza example, it seems so wonderful to be able to sell something like a pizza, or a tee shirt, or a service that you complete, and then are very unlikely to hear back from a customer again unless they want to spend more money with you. It leaves space for growth, since growth doesn't essentially mean you are compounding the chance that someone comes back to you years after they purchased from you with something they need assistance with.\n\nIt is slowly but surely sucking my soul out of me to be tied to something like this. My employees are paid well. I am paid well. The business is doing fine by all financial metrics, but every single day I want to run away from it and hide. I dread the thing that used to be fun.\n\nI often envy folks who get to clock in and clock out and forget about work when they are not there. I used to have that life. I didn't like it at the time, but in hindsight, I realize how much brain-space it freed to enjoy life and hobbies outside of work. I DO enjoy the flexibility I have from running my own business, however.\n\nThe only thing really keeping me in my biz anymore is my employees and not wanting to abandon them.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, I will be fine if the business is shut down. I will find something else if needed. I live a life with very low cash requirements and have good savings. Money isn't a huge concern of mine. The main concern is mostly my employees. If I never hired employees, this would have been shut down long ago. In that sense, I regret every hiring employees when I was dumb and people told me I had to grow.\n\nI am not looking for solutions such as \"make some processes\" or \"train someone to do what you do\". I am looking for some commiserating, specifically stories of folks who may have been in a situation like me, and decided to throw in the towel in order to regain their sanity. How has it been? Do you regret it? Did you ever get back into it later?\n\nI guess I could just grab some $$ out of the business and tell my employees it is their show now and I am done paying myself so its up to them to keep the lights on?

That‚Äôs why I gave the suggestion that I did. \n\nWhile he would‚Äôve wanted to make a clean break, he is very happy that he waited it out and he‚Äôs taking a backseat roll and mentoring somebody else. He still works on the day-to-day but maybe for two or three hours a day and he‚Äôs looking to release control within the next couple of months. And then because he still cares about the employees he‚Äôs going to officially/unofficially check-in and that‚Äôs a win-win for the buyer because that person can still use him as a mentor and as a guide.",

It all depends on how we are built. I'd be stressed out working for someone else if I felt their company might not be thriving and wondering how that might impact me. I get stressed out about friends of mine who may be at risk of a layoff or becoming obsolete because of new technology. \n\n  \nbut yes, running a business can be stressful and some people internatize things where others don't. I have stress in my job...but I learned how to kinda 'turn it off'. Some people can't. \n\n  \nA buddy of mine who owns an electrical contracting company kind of explained running a business in a way that I think makes sense. He views it as a train where you have to keep it moving and always finding new fuel to keep it running...it is about keeping that train moving. Ironically this buddy of mine used to have 30 employees....and was always stressed out. Now he has a half a dozen and much happier because it takes less fuel to keep things running(and he is still making good money)\n\n  \nwhat's funny is while I've learned to have less stress about my own business...i probably worry too much about others...i remember a friend of mine being fired and I lost more sleep about it than he did. I've gotten better though...and as I've gotten older the stresses in my life have more to do with the heath of family and friends",

But in the meantime while I waited before they took over, here's my solution and my suggestion to you.\n\nCreate a new business that's not too niche, doesn't require too much sales or explanation what the product/service is, and easily systemizable. With my extra revenue, I bought real estate. I created systems to purchase, renovate, and manage the properties. I went into other businesses that are recession resistant, and also some franchises.

Every single lawsuit between the franchisor and franchisees is required by law to be listed in the FDD. The franchisor i worked for often settled out of court to show FDD'S with no lawsuits.\n\n\nSubway's FDD is insane, like 2 bibles stacked on top of each other and 90% of it is lawsuits. I struggle to make sense of how someone receives that, sees all the lawsuits, and says, \"I still think I can make this work.\" If the article is true and there are 37 former Dickey's franchisees, shame on both Dickey's and anyone who buys one and fails (seriously, did you not bother to read the document before you forked over hundreds of thousands of dollars?)\n\nThen again, most may not have lawsuits because in the franchise agreement, you agree that all legal matters / arbitration takes place in the home county / state of the franchisor. Their legal counsel just has to drive down the road while you're buying plane tickets and hotels.\n\n\nMy former employer was careful to never gave sales projections, but if someone asked if they could make $50k a month in revenue, I'm sure the salesperson would tell them it's possible (and technically it would be possible, but the salesperson didn't tell you that you were going to make 50k a month; you did).\n\n\nThe last thing is people would lie on reporting their net worth. If my old company said you need $200k to cover franchise fees / equipment / build out of space, and access to another $150k for operating expenses until break even / profitability, people would just sign away that they had access to money like that even if they really didn't (and we have no way of checking because it could be inheritance, mommy and daddy, or in 1 instance a lady signed up for 16 credit cards at the same time to cover operating expenses).\n\n\nTL;DR please for the love of god don't sell yourself on the dream of owning your own business and throw common sense out the window. Go talk to current franchisees on your own if youre looking at a franchise. And if the numbers don't add up, don't do it.",
