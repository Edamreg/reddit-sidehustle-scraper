The admin side of medicine is at a weird limbo of claiming to need people but not having the resources to hire new people and train them. They would rather have an experienced person to do a heavier workload for the same shittier pay as a new person bc they are overloaded with work. At least that’s what I have seen.",

      "selftext": "ok so idk if anyone else is dealing with this but reddit is such a weird place when you’re trying to help people without sounding like a scammer lol. my whole thing is helping people start side hustles, like normal stuff, websites, small online income, nothing flashy. but the moment you even *sound* like you know what you’re doing, ppl either assume you’re lying or ask for a step by step blueprint and then disappear when you actually reply. feels like shouting into the void half the time.\n\ni’ll see posts like “how do i start a side hustle with $0” and i’m like cool, this is literally my lane. i comment, try to be genuine, no links, no selling, just experience. sometimes it pops off, sometimes mods nuke it, sometimes i get messages that are like “bro can you explain everything from scratch” and then they ghost after 2 messages. or they want results yesterday. like sorry my guy, this isn’t a get rich quick tiktok reel.\n\nalso funny thing is the people who *do* messages are usually the most confused. they’ve watched 100 youtube videos, saved 50 twitter threads, and still haven’t done step one. they want reassurance more than advice. i catch myself halfway through typing a long reply on my phone like… why am i working harder than the person asking for help.\n\ni guess the lesson (if there is one) is reddit inbound works but only if you’re ok with chaos, patience, and a lot of conversations going nowhere. some seeds randomly grow though. most don’t. still figuring out if that’s just how it is or if i’m doing something dumb. probably both 🤷‍♂️",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share the progress of my side hustle: building an independent comic book brand. I just officially released the first issue and a full merchandise shop.   \n  \nIt’s been a massive learning curve, and I figured I’d share the \"business\" side for anyone else looking to monetise their art or creative writing:\n\n* **The Setup:** I built a custom storefront to handle both physical and digital sales. Finding a platform that balances digital downloads with physical shipping was the biggest hurdle.\n* **The Inventory Strategy:** I decided to focus on physical copies rather than just digital. In the comic world, \"collectability\" is a huge driver for sales, and it justifies a higher price point than a $2 PDF.\n* **The Merch Strategy:** Instead of just putting a logo on a shirt, I’m using character art for the apparel. The goal is to make the merch \"wearable\" even for people who haven't read the book yet, effectively widening my customer base.\n* **The Design Choice:** Given the heavy use of AI in art these days, I made the conscious choice to hire a dedicated artist. It’s a higher upfront cost (which I’m currently recouping), but the quality and \"soul\" of the work are what will build a long-term brand.\n\nMy goal is to make this a self-sustaining hustle that funds Issue #2. If you’re an artist or writer, I’m happy to answer questions about the **site setup, finding an artist, or the fulfillment process** for physical goods!\n\n",

      "selftext": "Hii,\n\nI’m a bit out of the teachers game. I taught until 2020, and then worked 4 years in education with the National Park Service. I’m now an educational outdoor ed program manager. I work adjacent to kids and teachers, but I am not day to day with them.\n\nI’m looking at boosting up my TPT store again, but am unsure of the market or what is popular. I’m doing this because my family cannot afford childcare in our area and continue to afford our healthcare needs. We need a financial cushion of about $1k extra a month. \n\nWe can’t budget our way out of this. We looked at every possibility and we are, quite frankly, fucked.\n\nmy husband already works overtime as a first responder. I’m salaried and need a “side hustle” to make any extra money. My thoughts are start and Etsy store or revamp my TPT store. Considering I have/had a semi successful TPT store, this seems more practical.\n\nContext. I had a TPT store from 2018-2020. I made about $200 a month when I tried regularly. Right now, I make about $60 a month on it. I don’t touch it at all. I mostly made content for middle school social studies. There are about 35 products on my store and 400 reviews. about 10 of those products male 90% of my sales. I’m not stating from scratch, but I’ve also never made big money either.\n\n$200 a month was myself as new teacher in her early 20s who didn’t understand a lot of things. My products were fine, but they could all use some good revamping. also this was before AI (or myself) could reliably proof read 😬\n\nMy questions are the following:\n\n1. What sells well for middle school now? what do you look for?\n2. Do products need to be digitized for Google Classroom? I have done this to a few. are there any other digital platforms forms to consider?\n3. I used to promote it via Pinterest. is there another platform to promote it on? Substack? what do yall use?\n4. Is $1k a month too lofty of a goal? hoping to dedicate 10 hours a week to it and would like to hit 1k by September to keep us from financial ruin.\n5. I also make a lot of cross grade “Buddy Activities” for work that are more geared towards lower grades. They aren’t elaborate but they are thoughtful and themed. Are these worth anything to teachers?\n\nMy plan is to revamp a lot of products and create some new ones about maybe more niche subjects i have experience in, such as California natural resources and geography. \n\nI’m open to feedback back and also willing to hear about other side hustles that have worked well for teachers ",

Day.\n\nThese are hot leads. People who really need the service.\n\nThen I added cold email outreach to specific industries.\n\nGot positive replies that way too.\n\nThe demand is there and there are multiple ways to reach it.\n\nMOST POTENTIAL CLIENTS DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS EXISTS\n\n![img](qmr880eds3hg1)\n\nHere's something I realized.\n\nThere are three types of potential clients right now.\n\nHyper-aware: they know the tools exist but can't do it themselves. They lack the workflow, the branding knowledge.\n\nSomewhat aware: they've seen realistic AI images somewhere but don't know how to make them. Maybe tried and got slop.\n\nNot aware at all: they have no idea AI photography for e-commerce is a thing.\n\nMost businesses are in the last two categories.\n\nI'd estimate 50% or more are not really aware of what's possible.\n\nThink about it.\n\nNano Banana is only like 6-7 months old.\n\nIt's just a very new technology.\n\nThe market is still waking up.\n\nCLIENTS NEED WAY MORE THAN \"A FEW IMAGES\"\n\nMost businesses don't just need 3 or 4 images.\n\nThey come saying \"can you do 4 images as a test.\"\n\nAfter that, they reveal they actually need way more.\n\nThat's why I structure my services around recurring offers.\n\nX images per month for X amount.\n\nMost e-commerce businesses have ongoing content needs.\n\nRecurring income beats constantly hunting for new clients.\n\nIT'S NOT JUST ABOUT PROMPTING\n\nWhat I realized is there are two sides to this work.\n\nOne side is creating the images. The AI stuff. The prompting.\n\nThe other side is delivery.\n\nDelivering work to clients.\n\nCollecting feedback.\n\nDoing revisions.\n\nFinal handoff.\n\nThat delivery workflow is easily 50% of the job.\n\nYou need to be structured about it.\n\nPLANNING BEFORE GENERATING IS EVERYTHING\n\nMy biggest mistake early on:\n\nClient sends brief.\n\nI immediately start generating images.\n\nThis is incredibly inefficient. You get bad output.\n\nWhat I do now is spend 1-2 hours planning before I touch any software.\n\nResearch. Moodboarding. Preparing my approach.\n\nThe style. The subject. The scene. The brand.\n\nThis made everything way more efficient.\n\nAI photography is not just prompting. There's a big R&amp;D part.\n\nTHE BOTTOM TIER WILL GET AUTOMATED — POSITION PREMIUM\n\n![img](9oqoggwos3hg1)\n\nI think about what happens when the AI gets even better.\n\nNano Banana 5 in a few years. So good anyone can get decent results.\n\nHere's what I think happens.\n\nSame thing that happened to web design.\n\nThe market for websites under $5K is getting wiped by AI builders.\n\nBut premium work — $10K, $15K projects — still exists.\n\nSame will happen here.\n\nThe bottom tier of AI photography will get wiped with every model update.\n\nThat's why you position premium from the start.\n\nDo work that justifies the value.\n\nDon't compete on price with people who'll get automated out.\n\nMOST ADVICE OUT THERE IS WRONG\n\nI found this the hard way.\n\nMost tutorials and workflows online are wrong or surface-level.\n\nThe tools are so new that even Google doesn't fully know what Nano Banana can do.\n\nI ran thousands of tests to figure out my own systems.\n\nThe few people doing this well aren't sharing their methods.\n\nOnly way to learn: do the work.\n\nIT'S NOT FOR EVERYONE — BUT IF YOU'RE CREATIVE, YOU HAVE AN EDGE\n\nCan anyone start an AI photography side hustle?\n\nHonestly, no.\n\nYou need a creative eye. That's hard to teach.\n\nIf you don't have it, you'll price yourself low and get wiped at the next update.\n\nYou also need some understanding of branding and visual marketing.\n\nGraphic designers have been building these skills for years.\n\nThat's why they're in a good position for this.\n\nIf you're a creative — graphic design, photography, visual marketing — this compounds your existing skills.\n\nIf you're starting from zero with no creative background, it's going to be harder.\n\nNot impossible. But steeper climb.\n\nSO IS IT TOO LATE?\n\nNo.\n\nIt's really not too late.\n\nIt's almost too early.\n\nThere is way more demand than there are people qualified to meet it.\n\nThe field is wide open.\n\nAll you need is:\n\nBuild a little niche portfolio.\n\nStart reaching out to people in your niche.\n\nMaybe offer a free sample to get your foot in the door.\n\nStart working on real client projects.\n\nThat's how I started.\n\nTHAT'S ABOUT IT\n\nThis is not a get rich quick method.\n\nBut it's a real opportunity if you have creative skills.\n\nThe demand is there.\n\nThe competition is still low.\n\nI'm sharing this because I feel like a lot of people could use this.\n\nEspecially if you're into graphic design, photography, if you're a creative person.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any questions.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m Nicolas.\n\nI wanted to share how I went from being a baker making minimum wage to generating over $1.5 million in revenue. This is going to be long because I want to share everything: the strategy, the mistakes, and what actually worked.\n\nSo let’s go back in 2008, I’m 16, I dropped out of school in France to become a baker. The kind of job where you wake up at 4am, come home completely wrecked, and barely make enough to survive.\n\nBut I was obsessed with the internet. Every day after work, I’d teach myself to code. No courses, no bootcamp, just YouTube tutorials and reading other people’s code until things started making sense. Took me years. Oh yeah, in 2008, AI was only in movies, so code was made by real people 😅\n\nEventually I started making websites for local businesses. $100 here, $200 there, nothing crazy at all.\n\nBut here’s what pissed me off though: every time I took a new client, I had to learn a completely new WordPress theme. Different settings, different options, different everything. I remember spending an entire weekend just figuring out how to change a header color on some theme because the documentation was really bad.\n\nI thought: why isn’t there ONE theme that does everything?\n\nSo in 2016, I built it myself. Called it OceanWP.\n\nOther devs on forums told me to sell it for $59 like other premium themes. I released it for free on WordPress repository instead. People thought I was insane.\n\nThe first months, I started to believe that maybe they were right. A few hundred downloads, mass silence. I kept refreshing the stats page like an idiot thinking something was broken.\n\nBut then it started spreading through forum recommendations and blog reviews. People telling other people.\n\nBy year three, it was on 500,000+ websites. Still at 500K+ active installs today actually.\n\nThe model was simple: the free version was genuinely good. Not crippled, not annoying upsells everywhere. Just a solid theme. But if you wanted premium extensions like more templates, more features, priority support, you paid.\n\nBy year 2 I was making $15-20K/month. Just me, no team, no investors, no ads. Over 3 years the theme generated more than $1.5 million total.\n\nWhat made it work? I think it was just solving my own problem. Turns out thousands of other developers had the same frustration and I didn’t know it. The free model helped too. Free users became paying customers, and more importantly they told their friends. I also answered every single support ticket personally for the first 2 years. Probably wasn’t healthy but people noticed.\n\nI’ll share what went wrong in another post.\n\nSpoiler: I lost most of that money through stupid decisions. Turns out making money is very different from keeping it. Learned that the hard way, but that’s a story for another day.\n\nRight now I’m building an AI LinkedIn content tool. Same idea, solves a big problem for many people. We’ll see if it goes anywhere.\n\nAnyway, happy to answer questions about pricing strategy, the freemium model, whatever.\n\nCurious if anyone else stumbled into something similar, building a thing just because the existing options annoyed you.",

But my new gold standard is putting in a few hours of \"setup\" and then seeing money come for years to come. Literally maybe spending 2 seconds every month on it after set up.\n\nFor me, that gold standard is **OOH (Out-of-Home) Advertising.**\n\nI didn't buy a $100k highway billboard. I went DIY. Here is the breakdown:\n\n* **The Location:** Found a high-traffic intersection and made a deal with the landowner to let me place it there.\n* **The Listing:** Put a \"Your Ad Here\" sign with my number on the bench and listed the space on [**ADVR: Advertising Marketplace**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/advr-advertising-marketplace/id6745561123) (it's an app that connects owners with advertisers).\n* **The Result:** A local tree service company found the listing. They now pay me **$700/year** to have their logo on that bench.\n* **The Profit:** I pay the landowner **$200/year** for the \"rent.\" I net **$500/year** in profit for doing literally nothing once the deal was signed. (not including the $70 it cost for me to create the bench)\n\n**Why this beats other \"passive\" income:**\n\n1. **Low Maintenance:** Once the bench is bolted down and the ad is applied, I spend maybe a 2 second glance checking on it on my way to work.\n2. **Physical Asset:** I own the bench. If the advertiser leaves, the bench stays.\n3. **Scalability:** If I do this 10 times, that’s $5,000/year. If I do it 100 times... you get the math.\n\nIt’s not \"get rich quick.\" It’s \"build something once and get paid for a long time.\" This could then transpire into a billboard.\n\nHere's the proof in the pudding.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qsqmakj7mlhg1.png?width=1042&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd2b2fb5198bdc675c9033d502b11f7fba5bb775\n\n",

      "selftext": "Long story short, I’ve been lurking here for a while. Started noticing those specific influencers popping up on the feed and realized they were AI. Was skeptical at first, but after seeing the numbers people were posting, figured I'd give it a shot.\n\nIt took about 8 weeks, but just closed the first month over $1,000 (hit $1,400 total). It’s not the crazy numbers some of the big players are making yet, but it’s proof that this actually works. Since I learned a lot from this sub, wanted to share the setup.\n\nThe hardest part was getting the character to look consistent. Most web generators have strict filters so had to shop around. Finally generated about 25 consistent images of the same character before launching. If the face morphs between posts, people notice immediately.\n\nFor traffic, I made accounts for Insta, TikTok, and Reddit. Same pfp, generic bio. Posting 2-3 times a day on IG/TikTok (mostly simple reels using trending audio). Reddit has been the real driver though. Found a few niche subreddits that allow this content and the competition is way lower than IG.\n\nThe biggest learning curve was the platform choice. I originally started on Fanvue because everyone recommended it. It worked fine for getting subs, but realized the fees were eating into the margins way too much.\n\nI decided to test moving the traffic to Stacked recently just to see if the take home would be better. Surprisingly, the traffic converted about the same as Fanvue, but because Stacked has lower fees, I actually kept more of the money. Payouts have been fine so far, no holds or anything.\n\nAnyway, it’s a grind, but hitting that first 4 figure month changed the mindset. Just wanted to share that it is possible if you stick to a schedule.",

Real users, real results, real momentum, and honestly, I’m still learning as I go.\n\nIf you want to try it out, search MyFutureSelf on iOS -- and I won’t gatekeep the community… hit “X” on the paywall and you’ll get an 80% discount. 🙌",

I don’t want to sink a huge amount of capital into this up front, and ideally it’d be something that can scale or become more passive over time instead of just trading time for dollars forever.\n\nI’m considering a few paths: building a niche blog/YouTube channel or a mini info product (front loaded effort, passive later), learning enough to do small freelance gigs that can be automated or outsourced, and low-effort investing like index funds or dividend stocks if I can save a bit first. For quick, immediate pocket change I’ve also tried app rewards for downtime. For example, Mist⁤play is fr⁤ee to try and gives gift cards for playing mobile games, not life changing, but it turns commute or couch time into a little extra cash.\n\nHas anyone taken 2-3 hours a day and turned it into a steady secondary income? What worked for you, how long before you saw growth, and any pitfalls to avoid? Thanks in advance!",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nMy name is Nicolas and if you've read my previous posts you know I went from baker to making $1.5M with a WordPress product, then lost most of it because I was young and stupid. Life has been hard but I'm back doing what I love, building products.\n\nToday I want to share something different, not a story about my past, but a business model that's exploding right now and I believe anyone can start with almost no money. I'm talking about selling AI assistants to small businesses.\n\nBefore you click away thinking this is some technical stuff for developers, just keep reading. I'm going to break this down into steps so simple that my kid who never touched code in his life could do it.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding why this works**\n\nEvery day, thousands of small businesses are losing money because they miss phone calls. Think about it, a plumber is under a sink, a dentist is with a patient, a massage therapist is in session. Someone calls, nobody picks up, that potential customer calls the next business on Google and money is lost.\n\nBig companies have receptionists and call centers, small ones don't have that luxury. But now, AI can answer calls, book or cancel appointments, answer questions, and do it 24/7 for a fraction of what a human employee costs. We're talking about something that can save a business thousands of dollars while making them more money by never missing a lead.\n\nThe beauty is you don't need to build the AI yourself. There are platforms that do all the heavy lifting, you just need to set it up and sell the service. You become the person who connects small businesses with technology they don't even know exists.\n\n**Step 2: Finding your first clients (this is where most people fail)**\n\nHere's what nobody tells you about starting a business, the product is rarely the problem. Finding customers is, and with this model, finding customers is actually the easy part if you know where to look.\n\nGo on LinkedIn right now and search for job postings. Look for small businesses hiring receptionists, administrative assistants, or customer service reps. These companies are literally telling you they need help answering phones and managing customer inquiries. They're about to spend like $2000 a month on a salary plus benefits, training, sick days, and vacations. You can offer them an AI solution for a fraction of that price that works nights and weekends without complaining.\n\nDo the same on Indeed or even Google. Search your local area for receptionist positions at dental offices, law firms, real estate agencies, salons. Every single one of these is a potential client who already has a budget allocated for solving the exact problem you're about to solve cheaper and better.\n\nYou can also just drive around your neighborhood. If you see a sign for a local business? Call their number after hours.\n\nIf it goes to voicemail or nobody picks up, that's a potential client. Take note, come back the next day with your pitch.\n\n**Step 3: Creating your demo**\n\nHere's where you separate yourself from all the people who send generic cold emails that get deleted. Before you contact any business, you're going to spend 15 to 30 minutes creating a demo specifically for them.\n\nLet's say you found a dental office called Bright Smiles Dental hiring a receptionist. You set up a quick AI assistant demo that says something like \"Hi, thanks for calling Bright Smiles Dental. I'm here to help you schedule an appointment, answer questions about our services, or connect you with our team. How can I help you today?\"\n\nYou customize it with their business name, their services, their hours, their FAQ and anything you found useful on their website. When you call them, you're not pitching an idea, you're showing them exactly what their customers would experience. That changes everything, it goes from \"let me tell you about this thing\" to \"listen to what I already built for you.\"\n\n**Step 4: Pick up the phone**\n\nI know everyone wants to hide behind emails and LinkedIn messages and with many AI tools these days, it is very easy to get emails and reach people automatically but trust me on this, the phone is your best friend. Cold emails get ignored, but phone calls get answered almost always.\n\nHere's a simple script that works:\n\n\"Hi, this is \\[your name\\], I noticed you're looking to hire a receptionist and I wanted to show you something that might help you saving $XXXX per year. I've set up an AI assistant specifically for your business that can answer calls 24/7, book appointments, and never take a sick day. Can I send you a 30-second demo so you can hear exactly how it would work for your customers?\"\n\nYou will for sure get people who will refuse but most will say yes because you're offering something free and it only takes 30 seconds of their time. Once they hear the demo with their business name, their brain starts imagining the possibilities. That's when you schedule a proper call to close the deal.\n\n**Step 5: Pricing and scaling**\n\nStart simple, charge $100 to $200 per month per client, depending on their volume + a one-time fee for the initial setup. Your costs for the AI platform will be somewhere between $30 to $80 depending on usage and minutes consumed. That leaves you with $50 to $120 profit per client every single month.\n\nGet 10 clients and you're making $500 to $1200 per month in recurring revenue, 30 clients and you're at $1500 to $3600 per month for something that takes you maybe 10 hours a week to maintain. It really depends on YOU to move your ass and get more and more businesses to call.\n\nThe best part is once you set up a client, the work is minimal. Maybe a few hours per month for adjustments and support. This is money that hits your account every single month as long as the client stays happy. And trust me, when a business stops missing calls and starts getting more bookings, they don't cancel.\n\nAs you get better, you can add services like follow-up sequences, review requests, or appointment reminders. Each add-on is another reason for them to stay and another way to increase your monthly revenue per client.\n\n**Why am I sharing this for free?**\n\nEvery time I post something helpful, someone asks what's the catch. There is no catch, I believe the best way to build a community and maybe even find future business partners or customers is to share real value without asking for anything in return.\n\nI've been through enough in my life to know that money comes and goes but the relationships you build and the people you help along the way are what actually matter. Call me idiot if you want but I genuinely believe that when you help others succeed, good things come back to you eventually.\n\nNow I want to hear from you. Has anyone already started something similar? What's stopping you from trying this? Drop your questions in the comments and I'll try to answer everyone.\n\nLet's build something great together 🙌\n\n**EDIT:** For all the haters in the comments, I became a developer 15 years ago because strangers on the internet shared their knowledge for free on YouTube and forums without expecting anything in return. That changed my life, so yeah, I will keep sharing free tips, business ideas, and anything that can help others for as long as I can. Some of you clearly don't understand why someone would do that, and honestly that says more about you than it does about me. To everyone else who appreciated this post, thank you, you're the reason I keep writing 🙏",

This is for the person who wants the business results without becoming a full-time software debugger.\n\nThe \"Hands-Off\" Infrastructure includes:\nTotal Installation: I handle the backend software, custom nodes, and environment stability so it doesn't break every update.\n\n100% Face Consistency: A dual-layer IPAdapter and LoRA setup that \"locks\" your model's identity across 100+ generations.\n\nReverse Engineering: A workflow that takes any viral image and turns it into a usable prompt for your model automatically.\n\nThe Agency Stack: Face/Body swapping, SFW/NSFW transitions, and high-fidelity skin texture refiners for professional realism.\n\nWhy this is a \"Side Hustle\" engine:\nIndividuals: Skip the learning phase. Go from zero to generating consistent, high-ticket models in 24 hours.\nAgency Owners: Own your internal infrastructure instead of paying expensive content partners.",

No upfront costs, no scammy courses, just straightforward grinding.\n\nPlasma donation is another one if there's a center near you, usually pays $50 to $100 per session and you can do it twice a week.

Slow to build, but once traffic stabilizes, income is steady.  \n• **Land investing** (specifically small vacant parcels). Not passive in the beginning, but surprisingly low maintenance once you have a repeatable process. No tenants, no rehabs, no constant fires.  \n• **Index funds / boring investing** for baseline stability. Not exciting, but they do what they’re supposed to.\n\nOn the land side, what helped was learning from people who *don’t* oversell it. Mark Podolsky (The Land Geek) is one example I found useful early on because he’s very upfront that it’s a process business, not a shortcut. Lots of focus on due diligence, pricing discipline, and avoiding bad deals rather than hype.\n\nBiggest takeaway for me: anything that actually works long-term is usually boring, repeatable, and a little uncomfortable at the beginning. If it sounds exciting on day one, it usually burns out just as fast.",

He showed the entire year as 365 dots, and every day one dot gets filled. Watching those dots fill up made it hit differently - a whole year suddenly felt very small and very real.\n\nThat reel stuck with me and it gave me an app idea.\n\nI decided to build an app around that concept. The app shows the year as a visual dot grid, where each dot represents one day. As days pass, the dots fill up, so you can clearly see how much of the year is already gone and how much is still left.\n\nAlso I added event reminders with the same concept.\n\nIf anyone interested here is the app - [Dale](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dale-days-left-year-tracker/id6757920298)",

      "selftext": "Before i get started, I’m a student who started looking for passive ways to earn cash around summer last year. I had been running a tiktok page writing and posting short stories with ai images on slideshows and selling guides on my workflow, that was making about $500/month at its peak (summer 2023) but i got burnt out as it was very very hands-on (writing full fledged short stories daily while dealing with essays and deadlines). I decided to do some research and figured faceless YouTube automation was my best bet at making money and keeping it as passive as possible.\n\nI got started on faceless youtube with the long-form reddit stories and within a couple of months i was monetized, had about 1.5k subs, and was making maybe £75–£250 per week. It was good pocket money, and quite passive but the growth totally stagnated. I basically started on reddit stories right at the end of the wave, when it got super oversaturated with no way to stand out.\n\nI started looking for a niche that was high-complexity (so fewer people could copy it) but high-demand. I was scrolling through Zack D Films shorts and had an oh shit momentt and I started wondering if I could recreate his blender 3d style with ai.\n\nI spent a week tinkering, and I actually managed to clank together a workflow that looks surprisingly close. Here’s a quick breakdown of how I did it manually (before I found a way to automate and make it more passive):  \n\n\n**Step 1: Scripting**\n\nI’d go to ChatGPT and use a prompt like:\n\n\\&gt; \"Return me a clean Zack-D-Films style script for short-form content. Keep it under 500 characters. Each line should be a story beat. Cinematic and engaging.\" (truncated prompt)\n\n**Step 2: Visual Prompts**\n\nI’d then ask it to expand those beats into image and video prompts:\n\n\\&gt; \"Expand each story beat into an image prompt and a video prompt. Split into STYLE/CAMERA/SETTING/ACTION. Emphasize dynamic camera motion for video prompts. Non-graphic, no gore.\"\n\n**Step 3: Image and Video generation**\n\nI used replicate (developer api website, it’s pay-per-use, so i wasnt dealing with monthly subscriptions or queues) to make all my images and vids. You can use google studio for images and grok to animate instead if you prefer\n\nI used the nano-banana image model (much cheaper than the pro version) to generate a base image for each story beat.\n\nI’d then take that image and feed it into the seedance-1-lite using the video prompt ChatGPT gave me for that storyboard scene.\n\n**Step 4: Editing**\n\nI’d take those 6–8 clips, throw them into CapCut in order and add a narration from ElevenLabs and sometimes the official Zack D Films background music. If I had some extra time on my hands I'd add some synced subtitles (adding subtitles was the worst part holy shit). All in all it would take me about 2 hours per video and cost about \\~$0.80 per final video\n\n**Results:**\n\nI started a fresh channel (to not introduce context drift to the reddit one) and i aged it for a week. The results were ridiculous, it had taken me about \\~3 months to get my reddit stories channel monetised but the zack d films shorts account hit 4,000 watch hours and was monetised in just over 3 weeks. That was my fastest period of growth and if I had been monetised i did the maths and it wouldve been around \\~$4000-5000 in rpm based on views.\n\n**Step 5: My pivot to automation (passiveness) \\[optional\\]**\n\nThe money was great, but 2 hours of editing per short was not \"passive\" in my eyes. I was starting to burn out like with the tiktok ai stories channel.\n\nWhat prevented me from burning out and actually accelerated my growth was when the tool I was using for Reddit stories on my other channel added a Zack D Films format as per my request (i shared my workflow with the dev who then automated it). It basically automated the entire workflow I described above. I went from spending 2 hours per video to 5 minutes.\n\nNow, I post daily, and the channel is pulling in £1.1k–£1.8k per week. Because almost nobody knows how to make (or more aptly is *actually posting)* this specific style yet, the views are way more stable than the Reddit niche.\n\nThe reason im comfortable sharing all this is because information is never the wedge or gap in this day and age. There's an abundance of resources and information on basically anything, but almost no one will actually go ahead and execute. And if they do they wont stick around long enough for it to matter. Thats why i feel comfortable sharing my workflow like this without worrying it'll saturate my niche, and besides if it does, theres at least 2-3 new niches in the faceless channel space each month, and I always try to start one new channel per month (looking at getting into ai horror story guides). Truly I just want to give back however i can for people looking at legit ways to earn passively.\n\nSome caveats i learned from my time:\n\nLocation Matters: Being in the UK \"nerfs\" my RPM a bit. If you’re in the US, your earnings for the same views would probably be 20-30% higher.  \n  \nDont overthink the ai: there are some AI artifacts, but 80% of viewers on Shorts/tiktok really dont care as i noticed in my comments. Video just has to be engaging with a good hook (retention matters so much)\n\nConsistency: Posting daily is what took me from £300 to £1,000+, automate as soon as you can.\n\nIf you need the full prompts I use or want to see examples of the final videos just leave a comment. If you'd like me to do a write-up on my tiktok page and how I used to funnel viewers to buy the guides i can post that too this week.  \n  \nGood luck with whatever venture you choose fellow passive earner!",

You don't need to be an influencer.\n\n1. **Pick a niche:** (e.g., \"Gadgets,\" \"AI Tools,\" or \"Office Setup\").\n2. **The Math:** You need to sell **10 items** a month (at a $30 commission) to hit your $300 goal.\n3. **The Automation:** Don't edit manually (that's not passive). Use AI tools to generate the videos. I use **Keyvello** to auto-match stock footage to my scripts.\n\nIt takes maybe 20 mins a day to manage. Once the videos are up, they work for you 24/7.

So this is a pretty nice way to kickstart this kind of hustle since you can get free cash for opening an account.\n\nSome reward platforms also do this and basically pay you for opening free savings/checking accounts. Scrambly and Gemsloot are two that I use and have written guides about.\n\nAside from that you could try passive income apps like Honeygain, MobileXpression, Nielsen Panel etc, but these don't really pay much.",

I know that any policy/NDA/etc breach could result in the termination of my accounts and participation in each of the related projects, additionally getting me blacklisted by both companies. So I'm seeking to take extra care here and to learn if Telus' IRP and OneForma's MilkyWay and Search Evaluation projects would be compatible.  \n  \nFor instance, I know that it is possible to participate in OneForma's Lightspeed project and in the said IRP but I'm also specifically interested in the two other ones at the moment.\n\n\n\nTelus' staff either just states that I'm a member of the IRP or never reply whenever I'm trying to ask about the specific kind of program that the IRP would involve, explaining why I'm resorting to ask here.\n\n\n\nThanks for any helpful hint !\n\nPhilGrimnir",

      "selftext": "**Note**: *Not promoting this side project - its not relevant for people, only the lessons are. I blurred the name and details out for this reason.*\n\n\\---\n\n3 years ago I built a simple site for college students looking for off-campus housing for a specific area. Put it up, ported the data from an old Excel sheet the students used, sent an email blast to the landlords on the Excel doc, and largely stopped working on it after 1 month. It currently makes about $1k/year from subscriptions, and I'm going to be adding minimal ads soon. I check on it maybe once a quarter or when someone emails me.\n\nWell, I get weekly emails from Google Search Console, and the stats, impressions, etc. just keep climbing. And now? **I'm ranking above Zillow for hundreds of specific address searches.**\n\nNot \"apartments for rent\" or \"houses in Connecticut\", but for queries like \"123 Example Road\" - where students, summer renters, buyers, etc. are googling specific houses near campus or in that area.\n\n# The numbers (last 3 months)\n\n|Metric|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Clicks from Google|1,387|\n|Impressions|17,879|\n|Average position|5.5|\n|Indexed pages|23 (going to add more)|\n\nFor address-specific searches, I'm often **position 2-4**. Zillow is below me. Sometimes I even beat [Realtor.com](http://Realtor.com) too.\n\nOne query specifically: \"919 &lt;REDACTED&gt; road\" - I rank #3, Zillow ranks #4. My CTR on that term is 24%.\n\n# Why does a tiny site beat a $7B company?\n\nZillow optimizes for \"apartments for rent in \\[city\\].\" They care about volume.\n\nI accidentally optimized for \"919 &lt;REDACTED&gt; Road\" - the exact thing a college junior types when they're deciding between two houses for senior year.\n\n**Giants optimize for scale. Niches get ignored.**\n\n# The playbook I stumbled into\n\n**1. Hyper-specific pages**\n\nI have a dedicated page for each paid listing with the exact address in the URL, title, and H1. Zillow buries the same info 2-3 clicks deep in a generic template.  Side note: The SEO alone is nearly worth the subscription costs for the landlords.\n\n**2. Intent matching**\n\nMy page says \"student rental\" and \"summer rental\" and shows what students and summer renters actually care about: bedrooms, distance to campus, landlord contact.\n\nZillow shows Zestimate, tax history, and mortgage calculators. Wrong intent entirely.\n\n**3. Long-tail by default**\n\nI never targeted \"&lt;CITY&gt; rentals\" (impossible to rank). I target things like \"&lt;X&gt; university beach houses\" - lower volume, zero competition, high intent.\n\n**4. Passive maintenance**\n\nLandlords update their own listings - I just keep the lights on. Total time spent per month: maybe 1 hour for specific requests, or editing/approving new listings.\n\n# This pattern works everywhere\n\nThe model isn't unique to housing. Any time there's a giant who doesn't care about a specific user segment, there's an opportunity:\n\n|Niche Site|Beats|Why It Works|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Local activity blogs (e.g., \"Things to do in Lake Winnipesaukee\")|TripAdvisor, Yelp|Hyper-local content, updated seasonally, ad revenue|\n|College-specific resources|Generic education sites|Students search \"\\[university name\\] + thing\" not \"college thing\"|\n|Hobby part suppliers|Amazon, eBay|\"1967 Omega Seamaster crown\" - Amazon doesn't index this|\n|Local service directories|Thumbtack, Angi|\"Best plumber in \\[small town\\]\" - nationals don't optimize for 5k population towns|\n\nThe common thread: **specificity beats scale when the user's intent is specific.**\n\n# What I'd do if starting today\n\n1. **Find a market where giants exist but don't care about your user**\n   * Zillow doesn't care about college students at specific addresses\n   * Booking.com doesn't care about dog-friendly cabins at one specific lake\n   * Amazon doesn't care about vintage watch parts\n2. **Build pages that match exact search intent**\n   * If someone searches an address, give them an address page\n   * If someone searches \"\\[school\\] housing,\" give them a school page\n3. **Let the content maintain itself**\n   * User-generated listings, community contributions, or scraping public data\n   * Your job is curation, not creation\n4. **Monetize through ads or affiliate**\n   * These sites don't need subscriptions\n   * Traffic + local ads = passive income\n   * My site makes \\~$1k/year on basically zero effort\n5. **Be patient**\n   * Keep your costs low - these things take time.\n\n**Monetize through subscriptions, local ads or affiliate**\n\n# Final Note\n\nAt this point, the SEO and potential local business ad revenue (e.g. $20-100/mo for side ad placements) likely exceeds the annual subscription value. Someone may very easily pay $5k+ to acquire the site.  It was extremely easy to set up, I posted a few bulletins on the schools Housing Board, and emailed everyone I knew who had a rental house. Many were quick to pay the $100/yr subscription - I probably can charge more.\n\n*Funny final anecdote*: *The mayor of a large city nearby has 2 paid listings on the site, so we are on a first name basis and I have his number and email - maybe it'll come in handy one day!*",

      "selftext": "Started this journey back in March 2025 after burning out hard from my day job. Had some savings, figured I'd give the whole online business thing a real shot before crawling back to corporate.\n\nMy background: zero video editing experience, terrible on camera (tried filming myself once and deleted it within 30 seconds), but decent at writing and research. Knew I wanted to do YouTube because the long term asset building appealed to me more than chasing algorithm changes on other platforms.\n\nThe first two months were rough. I tried the classic faceless channel approach with stock footage and text to speech. Made 15 videos in a finance explainer niche. Results: 847 total views across all videos, $1.69 in AdSense, and a growing hatred for searching through stock footage libraries.\n\nMonth 3 I pivoted to using AI generated visuals. Started experimenting with Midjourney for thumbnails and scene images. Quality improved but videos still felt disconnected. The AI images looked amazing individually but had no consistency. Every \"host\" looked different which killed any sense of brand or personality.\n\nMonth 4 is when things started clicking. I discovered that several tools now let you create consistent AI characters. Tested a few including Artflow, HeyGen, APOB, and some others. The workflow I landed on uses a combination depending on what I need. For my main channel I created a \"host\" character that appears in every video intro and outro. Same face, different outfits and backgrounds depending on the topic.\n\nHere's my current setup and costs:\n\nVideo editing: DaVinci Resolve (free)\n\nAI character generation: rotating between tools, usually $20 to $40 per month depending on usage\n\nScript writing: Claude plus my own research, $20 per month\n\nVoiceover: ElevenLabs, $22 per month\n\nThumbnails: Canva Pro plus AI generated images, $13 per month\n\nTotal monthly: roughly $75 to $95\n\nMy content strategy evolved over time. Started with finance (oversaturated, brutal competition). Pivoted to a sub niche around personal productivity for remote workers. Then found my sweet spot: software tutorials and comparisons for small business owners.\n\nThe AI avatar approach works particularly well for this niche because:\n\nTrust factor is higher when there's a \"face\" presenting information even if viewers suspect it might be AI\n\nI can produce videos faster since I'm not scheduling filming days or dealing with lighting setups\n\nThe character can \"demonstrate\" software by appearing alongside screen recordings\n\nConsistency builds recognition over time\n\nMonth by month progression:\n\nMonth 1 to 2: Stock footage approach, 15 videos, $1.69 total\n\nMonth 3: Midjourney visuals but inconsistent, 8 videos, $6.36 total\n\nMonth 4: First AI avatar videos, 6 videos, $47\n\nMonth 5: Found the productivity niche, 8 videos, $189\n\nMonth 6: Doubled down on software tutorials, 10 videos, $412\n\nMonth 7: Started getting suggested traffic, 9 videos, $890\n\nMonth 8: First $1k month, 8 videos, $1,247\n\nMonth 9: Experimented with shorts (flopped), 12 videos, $1,580\n\nMonth 10: Refined thumbnail strategy, 7 videos, $2,340\n\nMonth 11: Current, 8 videos published, $4,200\n\nTotal videos: 91\n\nTotal revenue: $10,900\n\nTotal expenses: roughly $950\n\nNet profit: around $9,950\n\nWhat actually moved the needle:\n\nThe avatar consistency thing sounds minor but it genuinely helped. Comments started mentioning the \"host\" by the name I gave her. People would say things like \"Sarah explains this so clearly\" which is wild because Sarah doesn't exist. But that parasocial connection drives watch time.\n\nThumbnail CTR improved dramatically when I started including the avatar face in thumbnails. Went from 2.1% average to 4.8% average. Human faces grab attention even when they're AI generated.\n\nVideo length sweet spot for my niche is 8 to 12 minutes. Tried longer comprehensive guides but retention dropped off a cliff after minute 15. Shorter videos don't generate enough watch time for the algorithm to care.\n\nPosting schedule matters less than I thought. I was obsessing over optimal upload times but honestly the videos that performed best were uploaded at random times. What mattered more was the first 48 hours of engagement.\n\nWhat didn't work:\n\nShorts were a complete waste of time for my niche. Made 20 of them in month 9, got decent views (50k total) but almost zero channel subscriptions and negligible revenue. The audience for shorts in my niche isn't the same audience that watches 10 minute tutorials.\n\nTrying to scale too fast killed quality. Month 6 I attempted to publish 15 videos and the quality suffered. Watch time dropped, algorithm punished the channel, took a month to recover.\n\nOverly promotional CTAs hurt retention. Had a phase where I was pushing affiliate links too hard in videos. Retention graphs showed massive drop offs right at those moments. Pulled back significantly and focused on value first.\n\nVoice cloning my own voice was uncanny valley territory. Tried recording samples and creating a clone but it sounded off. The stock ElevenLabs voices actually perform better because they're polished and natural sounding.\n\nCurrent challenges:\n\nScaling beyond 8 to 10 videos per month is tough as a solo operator. Each video takes roughly 6 to 8 hours total (research, script, generation, editing, thumbnail, upload optimization). Thinking about hiring a part time editor but nervous about maintaining quality.\n\nNiche is getting more competitive. Seeing more channels pop up with similar approaches. Trying to build enough of a moat through consistency and back catalog before it gets too crowded.\n\nYouTube's AI disclosure policies are still evolving. I add disclosures in descriptions but unclear if more will be required. Staying conservative and transparent about the AI elements.\n\nRevenue concentration is a concern. About 70% comes from one channel. Started a second channel in month 9 but it's only at $400 per month so far. Diversification is the priority for 2026.\n\nLessons from 11 months:\n\nThe \"faceless\" YouTube model works but \"faceless\" doesn't mean \"personalityless.\" Having a consistent AI character adds the human element that pure stock footage channels lack.\n\nTool selection matters less than workflow optimization. I've seen people obsess over which AI tool is marginally better when the real bottleneck is their production process. Any of the major tools can produce good enough results.\n\nPatience is everything. Months 1 through 4 were brutal. If I'd judged the viability based on those early results I would have quit. The compounding effect of a back catalog is real but it takes time to materialize.\n\nTreat it like a business from day one. I track everything in a spreadsheet: video performance, revenue per video, time invested, tool costs. Knowing my numbers helped me make better decisions about what to double down on.\n\nThe AI avatar space is moving fast. Tools that were clunky 6 months ago are significantly better now. What seemed impossible a year ago is now achievable for solo creators with minimal budgets.\n\nPlanning to post a month 15 update if there's interest. Goal is to hit $8k per month by then and have the second channel pulling its weight.",

      "selftext": "Started this affiliate site back in June, productivity software niche, mostly high-ticket SaaS stuff. Been about 7-8 months now.\n\nFirst few months sucked. Maybe 50 visitors a month, barely any sales. Was targeting comparison keywords like \"Tool A vs Tool B\" because I figured people searching that are closer to buying than people searching \"best productivity tools\" or whatever.\n\nAround September October things started picking up. Traffic went from nothing to like 1,500 then 2,200 then by December I was getting close to 3k visitors. Revenue hit around $4,800 in December which felt insane compared to where I started.\n\nNow it's just stuck. Been at roughly 2,700-2,900 visitors for the past two months. Some days it's 2,500, some days 3,000, but it's not actually growing. Revenue's around $4,200 now, dropped a bit because one of my affiliate programs cut their commission rates in December.\n\nI'm still publishing, got 47 posts up now, but new stuff isn't ranking like before. My best post makes close to $900 a month by itself, ranks number 2 for some high intent keyword. But I can't figure out how to replicate that. Other posts I write just sit on page 3 or 4 going nowhere.\n\nConversion rate's decent, around 4%. I see people here with way more traffic but converting at 1% so I guess that's something. Most of my sales come from the comparison posts where I actually use both tools and show screenshots and stuff. Takes longer to write but people can tell when you've actually used something.\n\nStarted doing screen recordings in my posts too, just showing how the software works. Time on page went way up after that, from under a minute to like 3 minutes. Probably helped with rankings.\n\nGot an email list going, around 850 people now. Growing maybe 30-40 a week. When I send out new posts I get a spike in traffic and sales. Probably 20-25% of revenue comes from email but hard to track exactly.\n\nTried a bunch of stuff that didn't work. Did some guest posting, got a few backlinks, saw zero impact. Tried Pinterest for a month, total waste of time for my niche. Ran some Facebook ads and lost money, spent like $340 and made back maybe $190.\n\nI post on Reddit sometimes in relevant subs when I can actually help someone. That drives some traffic, maybe 150-200 a month, but you can't be promotional so it's slow.\n\nI'm using Ahrefs for keywords, costs $99/month which sucks. For images just whatever's fastest, usually Canva or APOB or Figma, doesn't really matter as long as it looks consistent.\n\nThe thing that's frustrating is I don't know what changed. Traffic was growing steadily, now it's not. I'm doing the same stuff. Writing similar posts, targeting similar keywords, same quality. But new posts aren't ranking.\n\nAlso seeing bigger sites starting to target my keywords. They have way more domain authority so I'm probably screwed on those. Been trying to go deeper on topics or find angles they haven't covered but who knows.\n\nLike did Google change something in December? Or did I accidentally do something that tanked my site? No idea.\n\nThe posts that are already ranking are still doing fine. They're not growing but they're not dropping either. It's just new content isn't taking off.\n\nSpending maybe 15-20 hours a week on this. Feels like a lot for results that aren't moving.\n\nStarting to think either I'm missing something obvious or this is just what happens and you have to grind through it. Not sure if I should keep doing the same thing or completely change strategy.\n\nAnyone else stuck like this? Or am I just doing something obviously wrong that everyone else figured out?",

I've been through something similar with a couple of my sites. One thing that helped me was doubling down on internal linking and building out more supporting content around my top performers. Like, if that one post is crushing it, maybe add some related guides or case studies that link back to it.

Your best post does $900/mo by itself which means your top 5 posts probably drive 80% of revenue. Instead of grinding out new posts that aren't ranking, I'd go back to those top performers and add more internal links, update them with fresh screenshots, add comparison tables, and build supporting content that links into them. Also with 850 email subscribers you should be testing different affiliate offers against each other - even a small conversion rate bump at your traffic level would be more impactful than chasing another 500 visitors.",

Google needs to understand your topical authority. (3) The \"bigger sites targeting your keywords\" issue is real and only gets worse. Your moat is going deeper, not wider - find the long-tail comparison queries they won't bother with. (4) 2.8k plateau with existing posts holding steady sounds like you've hit your current DA ceiling.

I only made 3 sales of the desktop app $75). Plus, Mediavine ads are down as well due to it being Q1, earning me around $110 in the last 30 days.\n\nRight now, 99% of my time is spend on our startup Genviral and newly launched iOS app, so there isn't much I can do but hope that the search engine gods start liking me again. \n\nI did ship some additional features to the terrific tools desktop app when I got Claude Code and the Max subscription. \n\nHonestly having tons of fun working on the desktop app and it has morphed into something really useful. Just need to do a better job of advertising it, which I'll focus on once our startup and app don't require as much active involvement from my end. \n\nFinally, the site was also down yesterday as I finally hit the free Vercel tier. Currently migrating the project over to my own dedicated VPS (Hetzner) hosted via Coolify. \n\nLet's hope the next update is going to be a more positive one :)",

The answer for me was figuring out how to do some of the work myself and also downsizing so I needed less help. I didn’t want to deal with firing my trusty employees that was the biggest issue but luckily a few of them ended up wanting to move on to different jobs anyway. The final step was I moved to a different state and closed my original office so that took care of another employee or two. Kinda just blamed it on the move and downsizing and they totally understood. \n\nAnyway, it was a long difficult transition but now I just have 2 employees - 1 of them is a salesperson who works remote and basically pays for herself and it’s very part time so no pressure, and the other is my spouse and we share our money so the salary thing doesn’t matter as much. I recognize this is a unique situation and might not be realistic for many businesses but it’s worked out beautifully. \n\nRegardless I think the sentiment of downsizing and doing more of the busy work yourself if possible is relatable. My dad was an entrepreneur and had the same issue but on a much larger scale but he said the same thing about there being a sweet spot when the business was smaller and then it all got messed up when he hired more people and expanded and everyone depending on him etc. \n\nidk your situation and if this is possible but hopefully it helps. \n\nAlso don’t sweat the employees depending on you and maybe needed to let some of them go, it’s just business not personal and in my experience the best thing you can do is give them a huge amount of time to figure out a different job if you do decide to downsize.

          "body": "Yes almost everyone feels this at somepoint. You've also said several yellow/red flags of common mistakes. \n\n\nI would highly recommend therapy and or a CEO coach, but first you need a week long vacation minimum where you don't answer any emails or check any work. No your company won't implode in 5 business days, but you will catch weaknesses in your processes.\n\n\nLet me address your yellow flags:\n\"Can't turn to anyone for help\". You absolutely can and should say \"I don't know\" followed by \"but I can help you find the answer\". Leadership is about learning and helping those around, not always already having the right answer.  Also you can find business owners, that are in similar spaces or promote/identify people on the team. I bounce ideas off other business owners, chances are the same problem you haven has happened millions of times before. \n\n\nYou absolutely can say \"I'm exhausted\". Literally you say \"hey guys I'm not feeling hot today so I may be a little slow in my response today\". We are whole human beings. In our weekly status meeting we would start with green yellow red for personal mood you could elaborate, but you didn't have to. \n\n\nyou're not responsible for the emotional state of everyone around you and your not solving for happiness. You shouldn't inflict panic or confusion but you absolutely can say \"Hey team that big job fell through so we are only going to have 10k in the bank at the end of this month, let's try to slow down non essentials\" if you give people more accurate information they can make more accurate decisions. \n\n\nI resented my company at one point. It usually means you're doing to much. I don't know your cost structure but go hire a chief of staff, coo, president etc. Let them run all the average business day to day and only focus where you add unique value. \n\n\n\"If someone took my place I would rather die\" HUGE red flag. You just said \"I don't want to grow and my ego is tied into this\". First at the end of the day this is about a lifestyle and money. There's nothing wrong about being at any size, but if you \"can't\" give up control you are acknowledging you will never scale past your personal bandwidth to make every important decision. I run two companies at the same time I absolutely give up as much work as possible to others. I'm there to inspire and pick strategy. I've already sold companies and lost them I'm at peace with any business.\n\n\n\"My business is like a child and I put six figures into it\" I'm confused is this a net positive venture? have you put in more than you've got out? Is this a viable business or a really expensive hobby? If you got your money out, hour much you put in makes no difference. If it's not cash for positive evaluate why. \n\n\nYes to answer your question I fell back in love my giving up everything I hated doing and dragging my feet on and only do the stuff I love and can add value. Best feeling was coming in when I wanted and leaving when I wanted because I was confident the team had it covered. I also have up control knowing people would do things differently, but it was my job to course correct not gate keep. \n\n\nPractical advise new company policy that every manager has to take off at least 4 days in a row once per quarter. Starting with your self. You need to step away and look at things objectively, and it prevents burnout.",

          "body": "Reading this, I hear someone whose nervous system has been under sustained responsibility for a long time. Being the person others depend on financially and emotionally activates something very primal. Over time, the work stops being experienced as creative or meaningful and starts being carried as a weight that never really comes off. The trapped feeling you describe often shows up when identity, responsibility, and safety become too tightly bound together. I see this all the time with the people I work with. When the business holds all of that at once, the system rarely gets to rest.  Resentment towards the company and the clients tends to appear when there has been no safe place to express uncertainty or exhaustion. If you’re always required to be the steady one, the honest parts of you get pushed into the background. Over time, that disconnect makes it harder to feel close to the work, even when parts of it are still meaningful.\nMany founders reach this stage because the business has grown beyond the internal structure that originally built it. What worked in the early years can become unsustainable when the stakes are higher and the responsibility wider. That shift often brings confusion rather than clarity, especially when there’s a sense that you should be able to handle it better by now.\n\nChange  is possible, but it usually unfolds once there is more internal safety and less pressure to hold everything together alone. Insight and motivation tend to return after the system feels supported, not before. You’re noticing something very common and real here , and you’re not the only one who reaches this point. Speaking it out loud is often the beginning of a necessary reorganisation, even if the next steps aren’t obvious yet",

It was the word \"automation.\"\n\nBusiness owners hear \"automation\" and mentally check out. It sounds like a buzzword from someone trying to sell them something they don't need.\n\nSo I changed the pitch entirely.\n\n**Before:** \"I'll automate your lead generation and follow-up workflows\"\n\n**After:** \"Your team is spending 15+ hours/week on lead research and follow-ups. I can cut that to 2.\"\n\nSame service. Completely different reaction.\n\nWhat I learned selling to SMBs ($3M-10M revenue):\n\n1. **They don't buy technology. They buy time.** Never lead with your tools. Lead with the hours they're wasting.\n\n2. **Show the math.** \"Your admin spends 20 hrs/week on X at $25/hr = $2,000/month. My service costs $500/month.\" That's a conversation they'll have.\n\n3. **Stop pitching solopreneurs.** They'll say \"I can do that myself\" every time. Target businesses with 10-50 employees where the pain is real and the budget exists.\n\n4. **Warm leads crush cold lists.** I started pulling leads from competitors' social media engagement instead of bought lists. People who comment on your competitor's content already care about your space.\n\nResults after the switch:\n- Cold email conversion: 0.5% → 2.3%\n- Average project value went up because I was talking to bigger companies\n- Closing time dropped because the value prop was immediately clear\n\nThe irony: I'm selling the exact same thing. I just stopped talking like an engineer and started talking like a business owner.\n\nAnyone else here sell services and struggle with how to frame the pitch?",

I kept talking about \"digital transformation\" and \"process optimization\" and people's eyes would just glaze over. Finally had a client tell me straight up \"I don't care what you call it, I just need my team to stop drowning in spreadsheets\"\n\n  \nThat math approach is huge - I started breaking down exactly how many hours their current process was eating and what that meant in actual dollars. Once you show them they're basically paying someone's salary just to do busy work, the conversation shifts real quick. Also learned the hard way about targeting too small - those solopreneurs will absolutely try to DIY everything even if it takes them 10x longer\n\n  \nThe competitor social media thing is brilliant though, never thought of that angle. Way smarter than teh generic lead lists everyone's working from",

The \"show the math\" approach is particularly effective because owners think in P&amp;L terms constantly - it's how they make every other decision.\n\nOne thing I'd add: the word \"automation\" also carries a subtle implication that you're replacing people, which triggers defensiveness. \"Saving 15 hours\" sounds like you're making their existing team more effective, not threatening jobs.\n\nThe solopreneur point is spot-on too. I've found the sweet spot is 5-50 employees - big enough that processes are actually breaking down and someone's job is to worry about it, small enough that the owner still feels the pain directly and can make fast decisions.\n\nCurious what your discovery process looks like now.

          "body": "This principle applies to so many business conversations beyond just sales pitches. I've seen the same thing with customer communication channels.\n\n\n\nBusinesses will say \"We have omnichannel support\" or \"We use AI chatbots\" - and customers tune out immediately. But when you say \"Text us anytime, we respond in under 2 minutes\" - suddenly people lean in.\n\n\n\nThe pattern you've identified isn't just about avoiding buzzwords. It's about starting the conversation where your customer's pain lives, not where your solution lives.\n\n\n\nYour \"before\" pitch answered \"What do you do?\" Your \"after\" pitch answered \"What problem do I have that you fix?\"\n\n\n\nOne thing I'd add: the specificity matters too. \"15+ hours/week\" and \"cut that to 2\" are concrete numbers that make it real. Vague promises like \"save time\" or \"increase efficiency\" don't land the same way because people can't visualize them.\n\n\n\nSMBs especially respond to this because they're drowning in vendor pitches all day. The moment you demonstrate you understand their actual daily reality (not just industry pain points), you're in a different category.",

If you're doing cold outreach, consider testing SMS vs email with the same value-focused pitch.\n\n\n\nI've seen response rates jump 3-4x just by meeting them where they already are (phone) vs where we want them to be (email/forms).\n\n\n\nYour point about \"show the math\" is crucial. When you can say \"you're spending $2k/month on admin time for X task, I can do it for $500\" - that's a conversation starter, not a sales pitch. The decision basically makes itself.\n\n\n\nFor anyone reading this struggling with the same thing: ask yourself \"what specific task is eating their time?\" not \"what can my tool do?\" The minute you can name the exact pain point, your pitch writes itself.",

      "selftext": "When I was choosing an automation tool for my outreach nobody told me exactly why automation is risky, so I decided to share what I figured out testing different outreach tools\n\n\n\n1. One of the most important things is how this tool connects to Linkedin. If its extensions caught easiest, cloud tools use API calls, and Linkedin spot them, desktop software is safer.\n2. Depending on the technology type price changes drastically. Cloud tools cost way more, but often times you pay not for the safety, but for the fancy UI. (no offence if it’s a key feature for you)\n3. Limits, and the way the tool explains them. It’s like the main thing I pay attention to. Does it actually stop you from doing dumb stuff like 500 invites a day or just lets you set that and blames you when you get banned. This makes a huge difference if you are looking for the tool for a long term.\n4. Can it connect to your CRM without making things worse\n5. Will support actually help if LinkedIn sends you a warning\n\n\n\nWhat else should be on here?\n\n",

Even the “safest” tool won’t help if your profile looks empty or spammy. Before you automate anything, tighten up your headline and experience, use a good photo, add a couple posts or quick case studies, and be clear about who you help and why you’re reaching out.

Some cheaper ones keep auto-sending follow-ups even after someone responds, which looks terrible and burns relationships fast.  \n  \nAlso worth checking if the tool randomly varies timing between actions. If it's sending connection requests at exact intervals (like every 60 seconds on the dot), LinkedIn's algorithm picks up on that pattern pretty quickly.  \n  \nOn your point about limits, I've found the tools that force you to warm up your account gradually (like starting at 20-30 invites per day for new accounts) are actually the ones that keep you safer long term, even though it feels frustratingly slow at first.  \n  \nOne thing I'd push back on slightly though: automation works best for getting initial connections, but once someone accepts or replies, I've had way better results switching to manual, personalised messages rather than keeping everything in the sequence. The conversion difference is massive.  \n  \nAre you planning to run this yourself or have a VA handle it?",

My efforts were directed at creating a business idea rather than identifying a problem that I could grapple with for a while. I kept requesting “what can I offer?When the better question was Many problems do I tolerate working on every day?”.\n\nThe transition for me was recognizing that being analytical + multilingual + learning CS already puts one in a rare bucket: one can understand technical stuff and explain it across language and culture gaps. It offers a genuine and functional advantage, except it has not yet taken startup idea form.\n\nThe biggest lesson I learnt was to always try and be useful to a specific group of people instead of trying to start a business. I chose a niche, frequented their forums, and responded to questions I didn't feel qualified to answer. Patterns started to develop gradually. The business very much came from that.\n\nAt this point, you aren't required to have a business idea. You require closeness to individuals with messy dilemmas.\n\nIf you had the choice of one group being especially useful to you for the next 3 months   who is it?",

Even with rocket science though you could still probably find something scientists need and would pay for for example ... Point is. \n\nMy best tip would be do something you love. You don't need certifications or anything for it. Forget your skills too. This isn't a \"job\" youre being hired for or vetted for. Most things you'll need for a business you will learn as well by just doing it, so most of your skills are irrelevant most times... Just go with something you've always loved. \n\nSome people like shoes, others like plants. Others construction. Fashion. Business. Teaching. Cleanliness.  Sports. Logistics. Snacks &amp; beverage. Real estate. Manufacturing. Technology. Ceramics. Gloves. Pillows. Wine. \n\nWhat do you like? (Answer in your head this)\n\nIf you for instance like shoes... \n\nSet up a shoe store. Set up an app that finds you custom made shoes for people looking for it. Make a shoe polishing business. Make a business that makes special shoe laces. Make a business that does custom painted shoes. Make a business that exports exotic shoe laces. Whatever you want that you like. \n\nOnce you got that just don't stop, keep going, get into the space meet people doing what you want to do. If you're consistent you can get great results and move past failures and obstacles more easily as well as build a tangible product overtime. Finding product market fit is also a whole other beast... and whatever skills you have or whatever idea you choose will have little to do with actually trying to ship whatever you make out to the world. \n\nIt's gonna take lots of hard work, lots of failures probably, lots of discipline and consistency. If you wanna be in it for the long run pick something you like ideally ... Not just for money, focus on loving what you do. Because you might not see money for a while. \n\nAsking us what you can do is something you should know better than anyone. Do something you like, it's that simple. After you pick something get into those areas. If it's, say, selling shoes. You're not gonna be here with this question. You're gonna be talking to people who are into shoes. So what you're asking here is extremely vague and you won't get much out of it because no one knows you or is you so its not easy. Ideas are abundant. \n\nSo, maybe speak more about what you like. What do you like? Is there something youve always been into? Then we can help turn that into a more viable business to an extent. No one's gonna hold your hand doing anything. So this is the moment you start what is a largely self discovered journey. \n\n No one can give you specific ideas here because only you should know what feels best to you... Choose something you'll have the best chance of excelling at, choose something you like that will make you feel happy when you get that first paying customer and see their smile. Not for the money. But for what you did. Something that will pull you through the hard times. Because things WILL get hard... And it's that light of passion for what you do that gives you that tap on the back to keep going. Money as an incentive is often always really rough (this is the classic give me ideas that make money....). Most people who start for money burn out quick for that reason. Their morale dies out too fast when they don't see money. Only a rare minority gets driven enough by it and actually succeeds. Best tip. Choose what you like. \n\nThe best things of people I've seen done always had some sort of initial passion for it or \"epiphany\" moment doing somethig that ignited a spark. \n\nModern vacuums for instance .. done by a guy who got fed up of his manual vacuum so he went through about 5,000 prototypes to get to what we use today. He probably didn't just sit to ask \"what should I do I need ideas\". Very different process. Lots of the best things done today happened like that. Lots of businesses same thing. \n\n Can change your life if you understand this.",

          "body": "I feel you. I'm 31, and have been trying to build my own business for several years. There's so much generic advice out there. Sometimes I feel like to \"make it\" as an entrepreneur you need a literal invention, funding / bags of cash, or luck. I've not \"made it\" by any means, but I've definitely learnt some lessons so far:\n\n1. To come up with an idea, you need to observe. Dedicate like min 10% of your constant conscious thoughts to entrepreneurial thinking. Why do they do that? Is there a way to make that better? Does a solution exist for this? Stupid example: see a bunch of people sat on the pavement eating lunch when you know round the corner there's empty benches -&gt; do people not have access to nearby outdoor seating area knowledge? Is there an app does / could do this? Vocalise it and stir up discussion within your circle. Most of my friends get lowkey annoyed at how much I do this, but you need to gear your brain to find problems for you to solve. Get used to coming up with lots of ideas, no matter how dumb, because most of them will not make it past the next thing I'm gonna say.\n\n2. Once you have an idea, try your hardest to tear it down. I've spent a year working on something that I was too proud to admit nobody wanted - at least in the way I was delivering it. Don't let ChatGPT put your idea on an imaginary pedestal. Try your best to find out what \\*doesn't\\* work with your idea. Competitors, cost to run it, access to data, or even if people actually want it.\n\n3. Get feedback from possible users. This is my most recent failure. I built something that I was so sure would be useful to people, but never bothered to ask my target users - I thought I'd build it first then market it, and someone would buy it. In reality, it's pretty hard to get your first customers - they want reviews, but everyone's too busy to help give reviews. Still working this one out. I'm going to try offer lifetime free subs for beta testers? If this works I'll check back in and tell you. \n\n4. You need patience. This isn't for everyone and I can't tell you how many times I've felt so sh\\*t about myself and my ideas after another failure or just the grind of having to push on with the dream after so little reward. It's not cost me huge amounts of money - it's cost me my time. Some people might get lucky with knowing the right things or having the right ideas, but not me! I'm in it for the long haul, and maybe by the time I'm 40 I'll get my break.\n\nI have no doubt that everyone can make it in this business, but you need to love it, love the process, and be willing to go the distance. I guarantee you you're more talented than you think, and that you'll uncover the skills you need to make it happen. Believe in yourself, your abilities, your work ethic. I'm sure you can make it happen.",

They sound like commodities.\n\n\n\nBut that's the profitability signal.\n\n\n\nHere's the insight: Profitable = problem businesses spend money to solve. Unsexy = less competition.\n\n\n\nThe CRO angle: Stop trying to find the \"next big thing.\" Find the \"currently solving a problem thing.\"\n\n\n\nQuestions to find your version:\n\n\\- What do local businesses spend money on weekly? (Office supplies, cleaning, delivery, accounting)\n\n\\- What problems do YouTube videos get asked about repeatedly? (How to fix X, where to buy Y)\n\n\\- What do people search for that shows intent to BUY (not to learn)?\n\n\n\nThose aren't exciting. They're profitable.\n\n\n\nThe boring business model wins because:\n\n1. Customers KNOW they need it (no conversion work needed)\n\n2. Repeat customers (recurring revenue)\n\n3. Competitors ignore it (less competition)\n\n4. Margins stay high (no race to the bottom)\n\n\n\nThe mistake: Entrepreneurs optimize for interesting stories, not for the \"I solved a repetitive business problem\" story.\n\n\n\nFind a boring problem. Become the obvious solution. That's where profitability lives.",

I know that sounds basic as hell, but hear me out.\n\nWhen I first started, I was coming off D1 football and just thought I'd help a few people get in shape online. Wasn't trying to build some empire or anything.\n\nWhat blew my mind was how fast the money came in and how HIGH the margins were. Like, 90-100% profit margins when you're solo. No inventory, no shipping, no bullshit overhead. You're just selling what you know.\n\nAnd here's the part nobody talks about... people will pay you INSANE amounts of money to solve their problems faster. I've got clients now charging $40-50K for college admissions help. Another guy helping people get green cards. These aren't sexy businesses. Nobody's flexing about them on Instagram. But they're absolutely PRINTING money.\n\nThe crazy part? Everyone's chasing dropshipping, Amazon FBA, crypto, all this stuff that requires capital and has razor-thin margins. Meanwhile, coaching costs $0 to start and you can land your first client this week if you actually put in the work.\n\nThat's the secret. The boring stuff is what actually gives you freedom.",

I'd heard him ask the same question on a podcast. \n* Had my answer ready. He pushed back on market size. I'd already rehearsed that objection multiple times. \n* He wanted to know \"why you?\" - I knew from his content he values founder-market fit over credentials, so I leaned into that.\n\nHe committed on the call. $50K wired last week.\n\nSame pitch deck. Same me. The only difference was how prepared I was.\n\nWalking into a pitch already knowing how someone thinks, what they care about, and how they communicate changes everything.\n\nAnyone else do this level of research before investor calls?

          "body": "Same idea works for sales. I look into prospects before reaching out and the difference between a generic DM and one where you obviously know what someone's working on is night and day.\n\nIt's not about being manipulative either. You just have a better conversation because you're not spending the first 5 minutes trying to figure out what they care about.\n\nTwo days of prep for a $50K check is an insane ROI though. Most people probably spend more time picking images for their pitch deck lol",

There are days when there are 20-30 pitches scheduled, and we know beforehand what kind of business it is and when they pitch, so we don't have to be there all the time (though of course the bank always makes sure there are at least 5 people for a pitch, and sometimes if you see something interesting you recommend it to the others and they get to pitch a 2nd time). If you want in it's up to you to decide your size: e.g. once I invested 3k while someone else invested 80k in the same business (total was € 125k). Obviously there are different tiers of investors: I'm small potatoes compared to some captains of industry. Which is what makes this actually work: as a small potato I am often quite involved, which sort of reassures the big potatoes. I think it's an awesome concept and the bank does a great job with their recommendations.\n\nAnyway, it's very obvious when someone has tailor made their pitch to score a particular big potato. And I'd say 90% of the time it has the opposite effect. However what is true in my experience, is that investors like to ask the same questions. So being prepared for those is definitely a positive (mine for example is how they see themselves collaborate with other companies).\n\nSee it like going on a date: being too cheesy is a turn off.",

If I want to scale, I need to hire, and where I'm based, that's not an option right now. Any day off I take is a day I don't get paid. You get the issue.\n\nLast November I started building my first SaaS. Content tool for text-based platforms. Launched it, got some early users, learned a ton. My goal was to replace freelance income by end of this year.\n\nLooking back at the last 4 months? I'm nowhere close.\n\nI'm heavy in tech, 15+ years. I've launched ecom stores before, so I'm not new to building things. But SaaS growth is a different game. It's slow. And I'm impatient.\n\nRight now I'm stuck in this weird middle ground. Freelancing pays the bills but eats my time. SaaS needs time but doesn't pay yet. I can't go all-in on SaaS without the income. I can't grow the income without going all-in.\n\nFor those who made the switch from services to product, how did you actually do it?\n\nDid you reduce client work gradually? Save up a runway and quit? Keep both running until the product caught up?\n\nI also have a family, mortgage, the whole thing. \n\nWhat's realistic here? Am I being naive thinking I can replace $20k/month in year one? When should I kill my SaaS and move on to something else?\n\nAny advice here is appreciated",

Replacing $20k/mo in year one is possible but statistically rare unless you already have distribution or you’re selling a high-ACV B2B product where a handful of customers gets you there.\n\n\n\nWhat I’ve seen work with family/mortgage is: don’t quit, but aggressively reshape consulting. Raise rates, move to retainers, cut scope, and aim for 2 to 3 “good” clients max so you can buy back 10 to 15 hours a week consistently. Then treat SaaS like a pipeline with weekly output targets (customer calls, outbound, content, partnerships), because the real bottleneck usually isn’t building, it’s distribution.\n\n\n\nAlso, don’t “kill” the SaaS based on time, kill it based on signals: if you can’t find a niche that feels acute pain, can’t get people to pay, or churn stays ugly after you’ve iterated with real users. Four months is basically still the learn-what-to-sell phase, so the more realistic question is whether you can get to meaningful revenue in 12 to 24 months while consulting less, not whether you can fully replace $20k by December.",

And the people in my field that do hire people to try to scale, it doesn't go as planned. Ends up just being more stress and responsibility for basically no more income.\n\nBecause of this, I too tried various other things that potentially could scale. Including building my own software.\n\nBasically, nothing else I have tried has made me any money other than me providing my service. And i've tried a lot of things.\n\nAs a result, I am a big fan of building your next move, on the side. Keep your day gig going. It takes a lot of the pressure off. And in the entrepreneurial business, your new venture is much more likely not to succeed than it is to succeed. What would that mean to your finances? For me, it would really really really suck. So I am working on those other ideas on the side.\n\nOne piece of advice I learned to late is, don't build until you have validated that people actually want to buy. Not just interest, not just a clear demand, but people actively trying to part ways with their money for the thing you would build. That's key. Otherwise you will fall into the trap that so many of us fell into. Building something not enough people want. Or, that they do want, just not from you. Or whatever reason people ultimately don't buy. Know that ahead of time.\n\nYes, I think you are being naive thinking you can replace $20K/month in 5 years, let alone 1 year. OF course it's possible.

But you're missing the part where if you stop looking at the path of others there is a great path to scaling for a services companies that isn't explored much. Actually, that's my focus right now.\n\nBut in your shoes, you should first try to get fixed price contracts. It will help you get exact clarity on the value you're providing and what you want to do. From there you'll also own any value from any improvements to your processes and IP that you implement. From there focus on creating IP to make yourself faster. Even consider hirin someone to help you. Technically you're still needed but in the process you are productizing your consulting work. Your knowledge and skill is getting documented in your IP. It alo means you can get a lot more value from a junior implementor.\n\nIP that helps you work faster is just as much valid IP as IP that you sell directly to customers.

For the past 5 months, I've been working on a SaaS to replace our current ticketing/psa/rmm system which doesn't do everything we need. Through Facebook posting on progress, I had companies reach out and say they were interested so I made a website and they signed up.\n\nWe just launched closed testing last night. I'm nervous AF, but I want the revenue to release me from my consulting business.\n\nI added in a referral program for the SaaS. Refer someone, they get the free 30-day trial + a gifted 30-days. When they on board and become a paying client, the person that referred them gets a free month.\n\nI'll let you know how it works out.

Keep consulting but get pickier. Raise rates, fire bad clients, buy back time.\n2. Use that time for SaaS. Even 10 hours a week compounds.\n3. Don't quit until SaaS hits maybe 30 to 40% of your consulting income AND is growing.\n\nThe \"save runway and quit\" approach works if you're single with low expenses. With family and mortgage? Too risky.\n\nAlso consider: your SaaS doesn't need to replace 21k. It needs to replace your minimum viable lifestyle. What's the actual number where you're fine, not comfortable but fine? That's your real target.\n\n4 months is nothing for SaaS. Most take 18 to 24 months to get real traction. The ones that blow up fast are survivorship bias.\n\nDon't kill it yet.

Transitioning to a SaaS model is a smart move, especially since you’ve already had some early users.\n\nOne thing that helped me when I was in a similar position was focusing on building a minimal viable product (MVP) quickly. This way, you can test your ideas without a huge investment of time and resources. I spent a lot of time figuring out what features my users really needed versus what I thought they needed, which can be a game changer for product-market fit.\n\nAlso, consider leveraging the feedback loop from your early users. Their insights can help you pivot or refine your offering, making it more attractive in a competitive market.\n\nI worked on something that streamlines that journey from idea to MVP, which made it easier to launch and iterate quickly.

          "body": "I’m on the same journey, similar circumstances. In my 7th year. Started as 100% consulting in something I had direct experience in, and I slowly started building a product, starting end of year 1. I couldn’t build a product to replace what I did exactly, but I could build one to supplement the services I offered.\n\nI would do the normal contracts, then see if I could sell the product to solve a small but recurring pain point. It was a small problem to solve, but necessary, so while the subscription revenue was small it wasn’t too hard a sell.\n\nI found it was more important to get my foot in the door as a SaaS vendor than to worry about the money. Because, over time, the product features grew and I already had the relationship. Upselling is often much easier than new sales. \n\nProduct development started to turbo charge early last year, thanks to LLMs, while development cost flat lined or even shrunk. It was difficult to find time to code when I had high paying billable work, so it happened in spurts throughout the year during otherwise slower periods. \n\nI did have an employee who both consulted and coded, they were an entry level hire so while it took a lot of time to train them, they weren’t too expensive while having low utilization. I too had projects only I could do, for whatever reason, so I had to win new, smaller ones, for him. While he certainly helped move the product along, 4 years and many raises in, he was mostly break even and started to under perform, resulting in him being let go. \n\nI hired a part time engineer and an in house accountant-trained-consultant, both off shore. Engineer was good, though financially questionable decision given SaaS revenue. Accountant/Consultant was the best decision I ever made. \n\nUltimately picked up most of the development myself as my employee gained enough experience to replace me on 60% of work. \n\nThe consulting we do, while still majority of revenue, has fully transitioned to consulting on an area of past experience, to 100% on our own product about 3-4 years in. Great for sticky customers and flexible staffing. By year 4 or 5 it all felt stable. \n\nLong story short, diversify customer base and hire / train. Cut back on expenses and re-invest as much as you can into training and product dev. It’s risky, especially if someone you train for a year leaves, or turns out to be a bad fit, but it works. Plan in terms of 3,5,7,10 year milestones, and don’t expect big results in weeks or months. \n\nAt least, this was my experience 🤷🏻‍♂️",

          "body": "While I don't have one concrete answer for your questions, what I believe would help you is breaking down you situation/problem and try solving it part by part. You ask a few different (and some contradictory) questions. So I'll try to do that and challenge some of your statements (feel free to react/challenge/reject anything that doesn't make sense to you).\n\nFirst, you say \"it doesn't scale\". My question to you: why do you want to scale? It may sound like a \"duh\" question but I genuinely wonder where that comes from (you want a different lifestyle, you want more money, you think it that's the logical next step -- what's your personal reason/need behind it? What is truly pressing you?). I seems it's because \"freelancing pays the bills but eats my time\". and you'd like your income not to depend on the hours you work (fair enough). But how would you like to spend the hours you save? Or are you happy to work same or more hours, but you want to scale your income overall?\n\nSecond, besides \"replacing your income by the end of the year\", were there any other reasons you launched the SaaS? Is it a passion of your, or maybe you saw a unique opportunity? Did you perhaps see yourself enjoying the new challenge or did it validate your expertise in a certain way? (Just a few examples). When building is slow, it helps to reconnect with the internal motivation (not just external e.g., I want this to solve my income scalability)\n\nNow the core part: you say \"My goal was to replace freelance income by end of this year.\" and \"I'm impatient\", and \"I'm nowhere close.\" after a few months. This signals to me that there's a certain degree of inflexibility in how you're approaching your situation likely because (bear with me) you have beliefs that clash with reality. I'm seeing that a lot in my own business journey too. What has helped me is adjust my expectations and beliefs of \"this must be done in x way, by x time\". I wonder if this resonates with you.\n\nNet, I sense you're stuck in a binary thinking of \"I must either go all in on the SaaS (but I cannot because I need the money from freelancing) or kill the SaaS, so which one is it?\". In reality, there are always more than 2 options but sometimes it is hard to see them. What makes these the only two options in your mind now? What other (interim) solutions could be possible? If your friend was in this situation, what opportunities would you see for them?\n\nFor example, you say \"I want to scale, I need to hire, and where I'm based, that's not an option right now\"- I wonder if this is fully true. If employing someone is truly a solution, then there could be location-independent ways to get some external help. Perhaps you'd need to compromise your profits for a certain time but you'd gain time to invest in the SaaS or elsewhere. It depends on what is the minimum income you'd need to be stable and what part you can give up temporarily.\n\nRight now, it sounds like you are actually in a fractional employment role. You're building a product so you'd diversify your income (which is smart). I'm a strong advocate for \"portfolio careers\" where income comes from a combination of freelancing, consulting, a digital product, a course/book, and a fractional role.\n\nPerhaps what you need to solve right now is not how to move from fractional role to SaaS business but how to keep both running without burning yourself out?",

Can any become templates, tools, or automated solutions?\n\n   \\- Your existing clients are your first potential SaaS customers or at minimum your beta testers\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*The \"runway\" question is the wrong frame\\*\\*\n\n   \\- Instead of \"save X months then go all-in,\" think \"reduce consulting hours by 20% when SaaS hits $2k MRR, then by another 20% at $5k MRR\"\n\n   \\- This gives you feedback loops instead of a cliff\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Kill criteria for the SaaS:\\*\\*\n\n   \\- If after 6 months of consistent effort you have &lt; $1k MRR and flat/declining growth, that's a pivot signal\n\n   \\- But \"4 months and nowhere close\" might just mean you haven't found distribution yet. SaaS growth usually doesn't start until month 6-12\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Specific tactics:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*Raise your consulting rates by 20-30%\\*\\*: Either clients pay more (giving you more runway per hour worked) or some leave (freeing up time). Win either way.\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*Shift to retainer-only consulting\\*\\*: Project work is unpredictable. Retainers give you predictable income AND time blocks.\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*One day per week non-negotiable\\*\\*: Protect SaaS time like a client meeting.

Looking back, I think I had a big ego when I had success. I loved being generous and taking care of people, but being in a position where I'm not able to do so, I don’t want to face anyone.\n\nMy brain is not able to think big right now or come up with ideas; it is in a stagnant state, I feel. And I think I went out of business at the worst time possible, because even the job market in IT is fed up.\n\nWhat I’ve learned during this time upon reflecting:\n\n* I truly understand the essence of networking.\n* Grit doesn’t always mean things will go well; you need a pragmatic thinker on your team who talks to you openly.\n\nAnyways, I have decided, in this Arab?Arabi?c restaurant, that I am going to start again. I have nothing to lose. I am starting at 0 today; 0 capital and 0 funding.\n\nJust my laptop, a roof over my head, and my bike. My trusty bike, the only thing putting food on my table right now. I love my bike; a stupid machine on two wheels, haha.\n\nI don’t have the \"big idea\" yet. I am going to take a different approach to building this time, something that gets me from 0 to 1. I will actively work on getting there rather than waiting for a light bulb moment.",

And if you learnt something, then you take it into your next business. You've got nothing to lose and everything to gain, because you've already paid for all the experience so you might as well cash it in.  Most successful businesses only come after multiple failures, according to research.  \n\n\nWorst case scenario it's you and your bike at a job again... that other people do daily.

For booking, Calendly or Cal.com (free) embed directly on your site and handle everything. For local SEO the biggest thing is setting up Google Business Profile, thats free and gets you showing up in map searches for \"nutritionist near me\". On the site itself just make sure your city and service keywords are in the page titles and headings naturally. Like \"Nutrition Coaching in [Your City]\" type stuff.

Here are the ones I can think of:\n\n* Email &amp; linkedin automation to generate leads: We have used tools like Clay to automate outbound emails and linkedin DMs to let them book a call with our sales team! This was something our team used to manually do- but automation has basically allowed them to take more sales call without worrying about this repeative task that used to take atleast 2 hours daily! Massive savings imo\n* SEO automation: Again, we noticed our SEO agency was basically just looking at our Google search data and industry keywords to come up with content answering specific questions customers were already asking on Google so that we became the top result! We were easily able to automate this using AI tools like Frizerly to get the same results for 1/10th the cost! This also translates to getting mentioned on both ChatGPT and AI overview as the go to tool for various questions! So again, this is saving us both agency fee and getting us actual customers over time!\n* Support automation: Once of the core problems we have had is customers often dont real our FAQs or website and ask the same question over and over again! Using tools like Sierra, we have been able to instantly auto resolve these questions! Others are still routed to a real support person! Saves our support team so much time now!\n* Quarterly Customer Reports: Lastly but not least, we used to send quarterly report presentations to all our customers based on our analytics for our tool helps them with to show ROI basically! We have been able to automate this almost completely using Gamma! We still review them and make ended before sending it their way- but saves 80% time for our team!\n\nFollowing to see what else others have been automation :)",

I made a tool for myself where I just enter my client's website, and it just spits out a fully revamped website that I just paste into Lovable. So I'm just mostly copy-pasting now, and prompting maybe a bit here and there, but often times I don't even prompt. \n\nThis allows me to give clients free homepage redesigns because its now quite fast for me. It's getting a lot of orders, nearly daily, but I wouldn't say its like super high ROI. \n\nI'm still new to sales, and web design, so I have to communicate better in my emails, and say the right things, but at least I'm seeing traction now. \n\nSo I can't say for sure if this path is super solid. But from what I'm intuiting, now that I'm getting clients (for free homepage redesigns daily) is that I can now move on to the phase where I'm focused on improving my selling skills, etc. \n\nI think also web design is hot now because of Gemini 3 Pro. Like the websites Lovable makes is pretty okay. They trained a small custom model to keep it cheap from my understanding. But Gemini 3 Pro is so amazing at website design. Try it out. That's what made me want to offer that to clients, and the excitement is pretty high for the free homepage redesigns. \n\nFor context I used to offer phone agents, and cold email engines. I would get like 2 replies per month from my cold emails. And many would just have negative sentiment to my cold emails. But with free homepage redesigns, people are actually excited, and appreciative, mostly because you're doing something for free (another key thing) and its something they need. \n\nSo when you talk about high ROI, I think we need to think in terms of a funnel. My focus is solving one part of the funnel at a time. If you just want high ROI, you're going to feel lost because the whole funnel is like a system you need to design and tweak. High ROI = improving every part of the system, not just the automation you offer. I'm still yet to see how this plays out, but I feel like I solved one part of the system now.",

Instead of juggling endless tweaks, you get fresh, targeted ad variants that focus budget on what's actually working. It’s like having a smart assistant poking the algorithm constantly so you don’t have to. That approach seriously cuts down the grind and delivers measurable lift without stealing your time.",

      "selftext": "This might piss some people off, but I need to say it. I ran a personal branding agency for three years. I had clients, I had a team, and I made decent money. I called myself an entrepreneur everywhere, on LinkedIn, on Twitter, and even in my Tinder bio. One day, a friend asked me a simple question: “What happens to your income if you stop working for two weeks?” I said, “It stops.” He laughed and said, “Bro, you’re not an entrepreneur. You’re self-employed with a fancy title.” That hit me hard. When I really thought about it, I realised my agency was mostly just me trading time for money, only with a few extra steps. I was not building an asset and I was not creating something that could run without me. I was basically a freelancer who hired other freelancers. The uncomfortable truth is that, in India, almost everyone with a laptop and two clients calls themselves an entrepreneur, agency owners, freelancers, even people who made one dropshipping sale. The word has been watered down so much that it has started to lose its meaning. To me, real entrepreneurs build systems that create value without their constant involvement, build assets that can be sold, and take real risk with capital, not only with their time. Running an agency taught me many useful skills, but it also taught me one important lesson: being busy is not the same as building something. I am not saying agencies are bad, I am only saying that having clients does not automatically make someone an entrepreneur. It is a different game. I am still trying to figure out what real entrepreneurship looks like for me, but at least now I have stopped lying to myself. Anyone else had this realisation, or am I being too harsh on myself and others?                                                                   ",

Many people, especially online, use “entrepreneur” to mean “I don’t have a boss.” But independence and entrepreneurship aren’t the same thing. Self-employed people sell their time. Entrepreneurs build something that can keep creating value when they step away. Different games, different rules.\n\nThat said, I’d be careful not to swing too far into self-flagellation.\n\nRunning an agency is not fake work. You learned sales, delivery, hiring, client psychology, cash flow, and responsibility. Those are not trivial skills. The mistake isn’t that you ran an agency. The mistake would be thinking those years were wasted because the business wasn’t an asset.\n\nMost people who eventually build real leverage start exactly where you did. They first trade time for money. Then they notice the ceiling. Then they get uncomfortable. That discomfort is usually the signal that it’s time to evolve, not to invalidate the past.\n\nAlso, the definition of entrepreneur is a bit more nuanced than social media makes it. Plenty of real businesses start as time-bound services and only later turn into systems, products, or sellable assets. The transition is the hard part, not the label.\n\nThe important shift you’ve already made is this one: you’re no longer confusing being busy with building something. That’s huge. Most people never catch that.\n\nInstead of asking “Was I ever really an entrepreneur?”, a more useful question might be “What would need to change for this work to become an asset?” Systems, productization, delegation, or eventually moving beyond services entirely.\n\nYou weren’t lying to yourself before. You were early. Now you’re clearer. That’s progress, even if it doesn’t feel flattering yet.",

Acquirers and investors call this \"key person risk\" - if the entire business depends on one person's time and relationships, it has near-zero sellable value. The uncomfortable math: an agency doing $300k/year with you working 60 hours a week isn't worth 3x revenue to a buyer. It's worth close to nothing, because the revenue walks out the door when you do.\n\nThe good news is you identified the right problem. The next step is asking: what systems, processes, or assets could generate revenue without my direct involvement? Even in services businesses, there are ways to build value - documented processes, recurring contracts, trained teams that can operate independently. That's when you shift from building a job to building equity.",

This was long overdue as my net income has surpassed my salary months ago. I wanted to dive into my business and finally grow it instead of just keeping it afloat. \n\nAlthough I have many ideas that I can’t wait to start doing, one thing I struggle with is discipline and keeping a consistent schedule. Previous I would work 80+hrs per week on my job during the day and business at night. Now without my job, I’m having trouble waking up in the morning because I don’t have a mandatory standup meeting to go to. \n\nI’m curious, for those who transitioned from working a 9-to-5 to working for themselves - what’s your schedule like? How do you keep yourself accountable and disciplined when you’re your own boss? Where do you draw the line between work life balance? \n\nThanks! ",

The body is not a machine and you could just be in the process now of actually tapping into your natural rhythms instead of forcing yourself to make the deadlines of your day-job while building. Start tracking how your days are now, maybe a later wake up is fine, but are there times in the day/week where your energy is higher? Notice and try to schedule work in those times. \n\nAccountability could be starting the week with one day just brain-dumping all the ideas and to-do’s and then letting yourself recharge a bit to them get to them in the following days when your energy is higher.

By 8 I’m logged in and beginning to work.\n\nMy house husband takes care of the chores and cooks (i help if i can). Around 6 in the evening I’m wrapping up mid day work and go down for dinner and to feed the dogs. Watch a show or something and chat. Then I’ll get my laptop out on the couch while we are mindlessly meandering through Netflix/YouTube. I do most of my invoicing, website updates, new content uploads in the evening. I also have a part time customer that is hands off that I’ll put ours in the evening for.\n\nOn the weekends I don’t work past 6 unless I’m home alone.

What you’re describing isn’t laziness or failure it’s what happens when multiple things collapse at once: layoffs, a brutal job market, bias, and rising costs. That combination breaks even very capable people.\n\nA lot of people don’t realize how bad things are right now. Many jobs are posted without real intent to hire, freelance work is oversaturated, and ghosting has become normal. On top of that, bias against people from certain regions is real, even if no one says it out loud. None of that reflects your skills or work ethic.\n\nYou’re also not “begging” for work you’re trying to survive. There’s no shame in that. The problem isn’t that you’re asking; it’s that desperation in a broken market often goes unanswered, no matter how qualified someone is.\n\nOne thing that might help is narrowing your offer drastically. Instead of “we do digital marketing, social media, automation,” try one very specific outcome for one specific type of client. Broad services feel risky to clients right now; narrow, concrete help feels safer.\n\nIf you need to take temporary, underpaid, or unpleasant work just to keep the lights on, that doesn’t mean you’ve failed it means you’re buying time. Survival comes before pride. This season does not define you.\n\nLastly, please don’t internalize the judgment from others. People who haven’t been here often believe hardship only happens to those who “did something wrong.” That belief protects them emotionally, but it isn’t true.\n\nYou’re not broken. You’re exhausted, under pressure, and navigating a system that’s failing a lot of people quietly. Keep going one step at a time, and if possible, accept help without shame when it’s offered. Wanting to work and contribute already says everything about you.",

Le agenzie cercano spesso freelance competenti che facciano il lavoro \"dietro le quinte\". In questo caso, il cliente finale non saprà nemmeno dove vi trovate; l'unico che conta è il titolare dell'agenzia che guarda ai margini e alla qualità.\n\n\\- Il marketing digitale generico è saturo di truffatori, il che aumenta la diffidenza. Invece di vendere \"Social Media Management\", vendete \"Automazione di flussi CRM\" o \"Integrazione API\". Sono competenze tecniche che generano fiducia immediata perché risolvono problemi specifici e misurabili.\n\n\\- Mostrate *come* risolvereste un problema (es. un video screen-share di 2 minuti mentre costruite un'automazione). Vedere la vostra faccia, sentire il vostro inglese e vedere le vostre mani al lavoro abbatte il pregiudizio molto più di un curriculum.\n\n\\- Provate piattaforme dove la verifica dell'identità è più rigorosa o dove il lavoro è basato sui risultati:\n\n* **Upwork/Toptal:** Se non lo avete già fatto, ottimizzate i profili puntando tutto sulle certificazioni tecniche.\n* **Cold Outreach su LinkedIn:** Invece di rispondere ai post di lavoro (dove ci sono centinaia di candidati), scrivete a piccoli imprenditori offrendo un \"Audit gratuito\" di 15 minuti sui loro processi.\n\nSe le bollette premono, considerate temporaneamente i siti di **Micro-tasking tecnico** (come Appen o Cloudfactory) o piattaforme di tutoring per l'inglese o le competenze digitali. Non è il lavoro dei vostri sogni, ma può dare ossigeno immediato.\n\nIn bocca al lupo!",

          "body": "I’m really sorry you’re going through this. What you’re describing doesn’t sound like laziness or lack of effort. It sounds like bad timing mixed with a tough market and a lot of pressure all at once.\n\nOne honest thing that might be hurting you right now is offering too many services at once. When people are scared to spend, “digital marketing + social + automation” feels vague to buyers, even if the skills are real. They usually trust one very specific outcome more than a general offer.\n\n  \nA few practical resets that might help, not quick fixes but clearer steps:\n\n\\- Try selling one small, very specific result instead of services. Something boring but concrete.\n\n\\- Avoid monthly retainers for now. They are hard to close when trust is low. One-time, fixed work is easier.\n\n\\- Show your thinking publicly before asking for money. Short Loom audits, breakdowns, examples of how you’d approach a problem.\n\n\\- Taking underpaid or survival work right now is not a failure. It’s just getting through a hard phase.  \n\n\nAbout “begging for work”, asking for work is not begging. It only feels like begging when the offer isn’t clear, both to you and to the buyer.\n\nYou don’t sound incapable or dishonest. You sound stuck in a market that is brutal to generalists right now. Narrowing what you sell and who you sell it to usually brings back some control.\n\nI really hope things stabilize for you soon. What you’re dealing with is harder than most people online admit.",

And overall, is it ethical type of self-promotion?\n* At what point does it still make sense to invest in seo instead of reallocating effort elsewhere?

Blogs every month, indexed, keywords sprinkled everywhere. Traffic was flat and barely any leads. When I looked closer, the issue wasn’t effort. It was clarity.\n\nOnce we simplified things, clearer homepage, clearer service pages, clearer explanations of what they actually do and who it’s for, a few things happened:\n\n* Google traffic became more relevant, even if it wasn’t huge\n* AI tools started referencing them for very specific use cases\n* Leads understood the offer before the call\n\nI’ve also seen the opposite. Clients with strong authority or lots of content, but vague messaging, rarely show up in AI answers. The systems don’t know *when* to recommend them.\n\nSo to your questions:\n\n* Traditional SEO still helps with visibility, but it’s mostly the foundation now\n* Blog content works when it explains real problems and use cases, not when it’s just “content”\n* AI visibility isn’t random. The pattern I keep seeing is clear explanations + consistent language across the site + getting your brand mentioned in various places\n\nhope this helps",

Problem is dealing with that cash is a nightmare, I can't mobile deposit it obviously, most ATMs don't accept deposits for business accounts, I have to physically go to a bank branch.\n\nMy bank branch closes at 4pm and I'm usually working until 7 or 8, so I end up carrying around hundreds or sometimes thousands in cash overnight which makes me nervous. I tried going to the branch on my day off but then I'm spending my only free time dealing with banking instead of resting or prepping for the next event.\n\nI looked into those smart ATMs that accept cash deposits but they're mostly for personal accounts, business account deposits require going inside to a teller. I asked my bank if they could just let me use the ATM for business deposits and they said it's against their policy, something about fraud prevention.\n\nSome food truck owners I know just spend the cash on supplies and inventory so they don't have to deposit it, but my accountant said that's a grey area for tax purposes and I should be depositing everything. I'm stuck between following the rules and wasting hours of my life going to bank branches during the only time they're open.\n\nHow are other cash based businesses handling this without losing their minds?",

I had an ex girlfriend that used to do it all the time, she would \"deposit\" a check for $100 in the atm, the bank would make the funds available, so she would take it out in cash but when the bank reconciled the deposit envelopes from the ATM the next day or whenever, there was no check.

I feel more tired now than when I was barely surviving.\n\nIt’s not the work itself. I actually enjoy the work. It’s the constant decision making with no off switch. Every day it’s something small that quietly stacks. Pricing tweaks. One difficult customer. A hire that’s good but not great. A cost increase you didn’t plan for. A gut feeling you can’t fully explain.\n\nThere’s no boss to say “you’re overthinking this.” No coworker to share the weight. Even when you have people around you, the final call is still yours. And if it goes wrong, that’s on you too.\n\nWhat messes with me is that people assume once your business is “working,” the stress goes away. It doesn’t. It just changes shape. Less panic, more background pressure.\n\nI don’t regret starting at all. I just wish someone had told me that a big part of growth is learning how to sit with uncertainty without letting it eat you alive.",

I know that’s easy for me to say, but I know people who have jobs working as teachers or maybe in sales or it could be any job that has a lot of stress we’re from the outside looking in I can’t figure it out…. But of course, I realized we’re all built differently in the stresses come from the same place just because you don’t own a business doesn’t mean you’re not gonna have stress.\n\nSo it’s not necessarily a business thing, even though that might be your trigger, it could be one of a plethora of things\n\nI remember talking to a guy once who owned a business that was pretty successful and he joked that the reason why a lot of guys go to happy hour and get a little drunk is to shut their brains off\n\nBut that’s not just business owners that’s a lot of people who go to happy hour, but you do have certain stresses but I think most of us overtime kind of learned you can’t sweat the small stuff\n\n\nAnd I found that most of the time I have a lot of stress it is over something really dumb. It might be something I have six weeks to get done but every day I put it off till tomorrow it just starts weighing on me and then when I actually do it it takes 15 minutes and I’m wondering why I just didn’t do it in the first place.\n\n\nI’m graded calling people back, but a lot of people have stressed because they aren’t good at that. I tend to get a little stressed out this time of the year because it’s my slowest time of year at work and I even had a little better than average January though that’s not saying much you always worry that business is gonna pick up again when it always has starting around March\n\nBut then I asked myself if I could be doing more to market to a broader base of customers, and I obviously could and I do a little bit, but not as much as I should so I create some of that dress as well, but then I have the problem of when I am busy I have a hard time keeping up because it’s feast or famine or so it seems\n\nBut I just try not to stress out on things I can’t control and set proper expectations and I guess when I’m extremely busy I’m so much more productive and I’m actually so much less stress stressed. Just because I’m occupied all day long getting things done when I’m slow I have too much dead time.\n\nAnd I can tell you being on Reddit is awful for people’s mental health or any social media so that’s just something to consider as well",

      "selftext": "I sell handmade leather goods, been in business 4 years now. Guy bought a wallet from me back in July. Full price, no complaints at purchase, left a nice review saying he loved it.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. He emails me saying he wants a full refund because the wallet \"didn't meet his expectations.\" I ask what's wrong with it. Is the stitching coming undone? Leather cracking? Hardware failing? Nope. He says he just \"realized it's not really his style anymore\" and thinks he should get his money back.\n\nI politely explained that my return policy is 30 days and that doesn't cover changing your mind half a year later after using the product daily. The wallet isn't defective. He just doesn't want it anymore.\n\nHis response? \"I'll be leaving a review reflecting my experience with your customer service.\"\n\nSo now I'm sitting here trying to decide what to do. Part of me wants to just refund him to avoid the bad review. I'm a small operation and every review matters. But the other part of me knows that if I cave to this, I'm basically telling him and anyone else that they can use my products for free as long as they threaten me at the end.\n\nMy policy is clearly stated on my website. The product isn't faulty. He used it for 6 months. But a 1 star review could genuinely hurt me.\n\nBeen up late playing jackpot city trying to distract myself from stressing about this, keep going back and forth on what to do. For those who've dealt with this kind of thing - do you stand firm and eat the bad review, or do you just pay the extortion fee to make it go away? I genuinely don't know what the right call is here anymore.",

Then I realize it's just not worth it to interact with the lowest of society.\n\nI'll give you an example. I had a bunch of items in a basket which are priced by grade and weight. Someone came up with a sticker from another item and claimed it was from their item. I know my products and told her there's no way that sticker was correct. She insisted up and down that I was wrong going on and on and on. Saying she would never cheat etc etc. She really ran me around and had me questioning things. \n\nI gave it to her for the sticker price knowing I was getting taken , and when she left I watched the video and saw her remove the sticker from one item and put it on to her item secretively. I was so freakng furious that she put me through all that and then lying to my face and using every skill that I've developed over years against me. \n\n15 minutes later I saw her walking across the street with her man and a 6-year-old son. They both had a sort of urban pride , he looked tough and had tattoos \netc. I walked over and waited to intercept. As they approached I held my phone out to her and said \"excuse me is this you changing my price tags?\"  She responded very authoritatively \"We're NOT doing this right now.\"  The gaul on this one.  \n\nSo I gave it to her. Called her a liar and a thief and shouted to the crowd on the sidewalk as much, pointing to her.  It became a big scene with her man defending her and me telling him his woman is a lying thief.  There was a lot of shouting and they never admitted to anything.\n\nI returned to my store glad that I called them out, but more frustrated than ever that they flat out denied everything. 5 minutes later she comes in saying she wants to return it. She apparently realizes that there may be legal consequences and wants to get out of the transaction now. I told her it's stolen merchandise I don't want it. She ended up leaving it outside my store just to get out of the situation.  I didn't touch it because I legit didn't want to have anything to do with it at that point. I don't want to sell something that has that energy on it when someone is trying to buy something nice and new. The item she finagled me on was a $30 large  handcrafted heart made of gemstone and people often ask questions about where it's from, etc etc..\n\nAfter I settled down I thought about how ultimately draining and pointless the interaction was. Yes it's good for people to be called out, but at the same time it's not worth it to get involved with people and their sh!tty lives.\n\nI can usually get people to admit the truth and enjoy exposing the lies, however after sitting I realized many cultures have a thing about losing face in public and will never admit to anything as a rule.  So when you're interacting with another culture you may be crossing lines for them that are more severe then their original action. I enjoy the justice of confrontation and tactfully push what I think I can, stopping just short of their fuse in a violent response. I'm never looking to get physical with people.\n\nSo this is perhaps a long winded way of saying do what works best for you. I think in your case if you have one or two customers a year like that it may be worth it to work with them to avoid issues. However I would make it clear in no uncertain terms to shame them in the process and say \"look what you're doing is completely unreasonable and wrong frankly, but I just don't want to deal with you right now\", \n\nI serve tens of thousands of customers every year. I've had the most idiotic confused people leave terrible reviews after being total rejects you wouldn't believe it. The unfortunate truth is that every single time, these people turn it around on you. They project their bad behavior on you like a scheming 12-year-old. As preposterous as that sounds, that's what happens every time. And then of course you also have to protect yourself against them having a social media following who may dox you or barrage your page with negative reviews. Sucks but that's the world we live in.\n\nI would take your ego out of it and do what is the best for your business.",

Those that are recommending that the OP tell the customer to pound sand, how would you respond to a review like this:\n\n&gt;I was really excited to purchase a hand-made wallet from Acme Wallets.  I've been tired of buying crap on Amazon and being unhappy with it.  I long for the nostalgia of the old days where handmade goods lasted decades and you chose a \"wallet\" for life.\n\n&gt;Unfortunately, this was not my experience with the wallet I bought from Acme Wallets.  I paid nearly five times as much for this wallet, and I felt that the quality just wasn't there.  Every day, I took the wallet out and used it, and I got irritated because I spent so much money on this thing and was so bitterly disappointed.  The stitching was off, the configuration of the wallet was odd, and after six months, the colors started to fade on one side and not the other.  Again, very disappointed.\n\n&gt;I contacted Acme Wallets to express my concerns, and asked to return the wallet after about six months of frustrating use.  They basically told me that there was a 30-day return policy and there were no exceptions made.  Even though they claim on their website that they stand behind their products, in the end, I really felt like the value and quality of the wallet wasn't worth the price.  I tried - I really tried to like it, but every day, it kept reminding me of how much I feel I overspent on this.  I would have expected this response from some Asia-sourced vendor on Amazon, but not one here.\n\n&gt;Disappointed, and now the wallet is heading to the pile to be donated to Goodwill.  Buyer beware.\n\nOkay - I'll challenge  here.  How would a business owner respond to a review like this?  This would be devastating to the business.  Is it worth it to risk a customer posting something like this?  Everything posted above is the opinion of the customer, which is impossible to effectively argue with (everyone is entitled to their opinion).  \n\nIf the customer is unhappy with your product, and is not using it, then there is something inherently wrong with the product meeting his expectations.  You do \\*not\\* want someone with unmet expectations with your product posting a product review.  Plain and simple.\n\nBottomline, refund the customer - the cost of a single wallet is not worth the risk of receiving a review like this that would seriously damage your business.",

I built it from nothing, learned things the hard way, and I’ve managed to keep it alive longer than a lot of people told me it would last. I even have some money saved up from myprize, which still feels strange to say because for a long time everything went straight back into the business.  \nWhat I wasn’t prepared for is how isolating the decision making can feel.  \nEvery choice feels like it matters more than it probably does. Pricing, hiring help, saying no to a client, saying yes to the wrong one. There’s no manager to sanity check things, no team meeting where someone else shares the weight. It’s just me, my laptop, and a constant background question of am I doing this right.\n\nI’ll go back and forth for days over things that look small from the outside. Spend a little to save time or save the money and burn myself out. Play it safe or take a risk. Protect the cash I worked hard to build or reinvest and hope it pays off. Either way, if it goes wrong, it’s on me.\n\nWhat makes it harder is that people assume owning a business means freedom and confidence. So I don’t really talk about the doubt part. I nod along, say things are good, and keep the stress to myself. I don’t regret starting this at all. I just didn’t realize how much of the job is sitting quietly with uncertainty and still having to move forward.\n\nI guess I’m curious how other small business owners deal with that. Does the constant second guessing ever calm down, or do you just get better at carrying it without letting it take over everything.",

You are still getting your paycheck each Friday regardless. When people do that to  a small business it directly and immediately affects my bottom line that week.\"\n\n He also was always quick to say \"just hire more people\" and is forgetting hiring more people equates to two things...1. where do I possibly find individuals with the specific skill sets I need, not like hiring a high school kid for Walmart AND 2. hiring also then again cuts into my bottom line and is hiring more help going to improve or grow our business enough to justify the pay-out? \n\nI feel your pain.",

If it’s reversible, timebox it and ship.\n* Write one next action you can do today. Not “decide”, but “test”, “ask”, “price check”, “call”.\n\nSecond guessing rarely disappears.

I just kind of like variety and don't like to do the same thing all the time. \n\nPart of the reason I want to be self-employed is I don't want anybody else to have any input on decisions.. \nI'll totally admit it.\nI want to sink or swim and on my own accord.\nNow there have been times where I have consulted a family member or friends about decisions I might be making but that's just for discussion or to work through things because I want to be the only one that has not just the final say but the only say.\n\nI don't really have any problem making decisions. \nI also find it's not really that important and I tend to just go where life takes me. \nThen, if I want to do something I just figured I should go ahead and do it. \n\nI guess a lot of this has to do with it what type of work you actually do in your business and you didn't give us much info on that. \n\nI have seen some memes floating around and seen at least a couple but mainly one person who repeatedly post about how hard it is to be a small business owner. Lol\nThey talk about how you never had any free time and how you're always on call and all of this stuff. \nI think they're nuts!!\n\nThis is more than likely true for a lot of young people just getting into business but that's because they're too fresh at it too hungry/greedy is what I call them.\n\nOnce you've been doing it for a while or 3 decades plus like I have, you just get your day in or do what little dab you have to to meet your deadline or make the money you need to make for the day, week, month etc and that's good enough. \nAt least it always has been for me. \n\nUsually about every year or so I will get motivated and want to buy something. \nSometimes these things are fairly expensive and I never actually need them. \nSo I get motivated and I hustle and do a bunch of extra work so I can go spend it. \n\nI  have plenty of savings too and I make it a point to increase that savings a minimum amount each and every year. \n\n\nSometimes it's just time management. Use the settings on your electronic devices or whatever to have your phone or emails etc only work during hours that you're open. \nSend them to an automated message before and after these times. \nFor the past two days I have had customers calling me at 7:30 a.m., 7:52 a.m., 8:12 a.m. and 8:32 a.m. when I don't open until 9:00. \nSome of them left a message but it really doesn't matter because none of them will get an answer before I'm open and most of them probably won't get a call back even if they left a message.\n\nIf you're not smart enough or  considerate enough to see the hours when you find the listing before you hit the clip to call button then I don't think I want you as a customer. \n\nI blame Google a lot for this. They have put the send a text tab on multiple listings when I never authorized it and I don't want it there because I'm not going to conduct business via text messaging.\nThey also will show you on maps if you're navigating there when you click on it that the business is not open yet or may not be still open when you get there if it's close to closing but they don't bother to show this when someone clicks to call. \nThere should at least be an extra prompt saying this business is currently closed would you still like to call? \n\nThe biggest thing that's negative about running your own business is what people have always said about the worst thing with dealing with the public IS dealing with the public.\nIt's also the main reason a lot of people stop running businesses and not because it's hard or timing or anything else.",

I kept my mouth shut. There were a few people who were mentor types who I talked to, but for the most part I didn't tell friends about all the work I was doing setting up my business. My mantra was that my work would do the talking later. It kind of drove my wife crazy when people would ask my about what I was doing and I would just talk about parenting. For me, personally, I could feel the energy that would have gone into talking about it go into actually doing things to build it. It may or may not work for other people, but I really credit this strategy for helping me stay focused on the work instead of seeking affirmation from talking about it.\n\nLearning basic spreadsheet skills really helped manage things before I got to the point where I could use purpose built tools.

BUT when you really know nothing about how to start a business, have no one to help you, and need to do it quickly… it’s probably your best chance at not missing something. If I had given things a little more thought beforehand, I probably could’ve gotten things up and going on my own with a little research and guidance from my mother in law that used to put together shell corporations for the law firm she worked for. Really wish I would’ve known that last little detail. 😕\n\nAnyway, from a bookkeeping standpoint… find out what needs to be filled out at the state level and what needs to be submitted at the federal level. Product based businesses will have different requirements than service based businesses. And then take note of when federal taxes will need filed. Some do estimations quarterly, some do it annually with their personal taxes… and that’ll depend on what type of business you file for (LLC, Sole Proprietorship, S Corp, etc).\n\nFrom a personal standpoint, make sure you have the time and resources to support this venture. I got myself into debt pretty quickly thinking I needed to have a bunch of options. I have a product based business and while inventory is important… my inventory grew way too large, very quickly. So, space became scarce for me. I’m working full time because my business doesn’t support a livable wage yet, so time to build a website and create marketing campaigns rats DEEP into family time for me. I feel like even when I’m home, I work until I go to bed and not even on anything that I actually sell… it’s all on stuff just to hopefully get my business in front of people that might hopefully buy my products. I hope that one day this ship rights itself because right now I feel like I don’t know which way is up. It’s not for the faint of heart, that’s for sure! I wish I would have had a clearer, more edited picture of what I wanted to offer and how I wanted to offer it… instead I feel like I’m always scrambling.\n\nTL:DR- LegalZoom is helpful, but pricey. And do some market research before investing time and money into it. Like others have said, you need to make sure there’s actually a market for what you want to offer.",

We have not changed the code or the site since that remediation was completed\n\nNew Claim  \nSame law firm is suing us again, but using a different \"plaintiff\"  \nPlaintiff's name shows up as a serial filer\n\nThe \"Service\"  \nThey didn't even serve me (yet?) An advertising firm emailed the complaint (no case number) to my boyfriend’s personal email address\n\nSite  \nOur website should be good. It scores 100 on Google Lighthouse and 0 Issues on axe DevTools. I even have a letter from a blind customer stating the site works perfectly for her\n\nWe are hanging by a thread. We’ve closed most of our locations and are sitting on $500k in EIDL debt from COVID. We literally have no cash to settle again\n\nOur lawyer is suggesting we just settle again to make it go away, but we don't have the money. I’ve told him we are \"judgment proof\" since the EIDL loan essentially means the government has first rights to our assets and we have no profit to take\n\nQuestions for the community\n\n1. Has anyone successfully used a prior settlement/remediation to get a second suit from the same firm thrown out?\n2. Since the EIDL loan is so high and the business is failing, has anyone successfully argued \"judgment proof\" to get these guys to stop wasting their time?\n\nI’m exhausted. It feels like it doesn't matter if your site is up to code, they just keep coming back. Any advice is appreciated\n\nFor all small business owners out there that have been through this and more, my heart goes out to you!",

That sounds really stressful and frustrating.\n\nI'm not a lawyer, but this is how I would approach it if it were me:\n\nFirst, I’d step back and look at who’s actually benefiting. The law firm makes money when I settle. If I keep paying, I’m making it easy for them to keep suing. That’s not solving my problem, it’s solving theirs.\n\nThen I’d try to break the pattern. If they expect me to settle quickly, I’d do the opposite. I’d ask questions, push back, and make it more work for them. The goal is to stop being an easy target.\n\nI’d also try to buy time. I’d check if the lawsuit was served properly, ask what exactly I’m being accused of, and point out if I already fixed the issue. Slowing things down gives me more control.\n\nI’d do some of my own research too. Just a quick Google search helped me find Rule 11, which looks like something that can be used in California to push back if the lawsuit is being filed just to pressure settlements without real investigation.\n\nAnd if my lawyer seems more focused on settling than protecting me, I’d consider finding someone else. It’s okay to question advice if it doesn’t feel right for you.\n\nI know this is exhausting, especially if you’re already in debt and juggling too many problems.

I keep getting groups of customers sometimes 15–20 people, asking for the same specific item or style. The problem is I might only have 3–4 of those pieces or a few similar ones. People are actually willing to wait for restocks, which is great but after a few weeks I end up having to message them explaining that I just couldn’t source more of it and they’re understandably disappointed. I know exactly what my customers want, I just can’t seem to get enough of it.\n\nUp until now I’ve been sourcing from smaller vintage wholesalers, local markets and random finds but it’s clearly not scaling with demand anymore. I feel like I’m starting to lose customers not because they don’t like my shop but because I can’t provide enough quantity of the things they want. So I wanted to ask here where do you find bigger more reliable vintage suppliers?\n\n",

While few things are truly one-of-a-kind, there not making any more, so getting repeats of anything are difficult.\n\nAssuming you want to stay true to being a vintage business, as many of us do, you just have to be willing to scale your picking. Estate sales, garage sales, Facebook marketplace, and frequent thrift store visits. Trying to find people will to sell larger “lots” of items you specialize in and you can buy inventory in bulk and at lower prices. I always have 3 times as much inventory in my garage as I can sell at one time in my shop. \n\nSome of the larger stores get to a point where they can afford to pay professional pickers, but then your prices have to go up. I don’t do clothes personally, but the dealers I know who do and successful often network their way to finding individuals from whom they can purchase their entire collection for a set price and then sort the sellable from the donation pile. My mother (also a dealer) does this and will often leave with 8-10 huge trash bags of clothes from one house. Half to 2/3 goes to donation, but when she bought it all for $400 the margins are insane. \n\nThe purchasing often takes more time than the actual selling, so you really have to commit yourself to that being a central part of the business model.",

I have a team of 14 employees.\n\nWe had several verbal warning conversations in different iterations and I saw improvement at first. Recently, we had some major issues with them arriving late, running behind with clients, and charging inappropriately. We had a written warning meeting which was met with a lot of defensiveness from the employee.\n\nFor context - it’s a hair salon.\n\nToday I asked them if they were going to finish their client in time or if they’d be running behind. They assured me they’d be finished on time.\n\nThey were a full half hour late for their next client. And charged the first client (who they spent 7 hours with) incorrectly.\n\nI had my manager meet me at work and we met with the stylist and let them go.\n\nThey acted surprised - but we reminded them of every meeting we had leading up to it. Frankly, I was very sad to have to let them go. but it’s not sustainable.\n\nThe morale has already been low and I know this will be a big blow. It’s a small team and several of them are very good friends with the person who was fired.\n\nI’m not sure how to show up for the team to let the know this really shouldn’t have been a surprise for the person who got fired. I know I have to be vague.\n\nI don’t want anyone to be worried about their job.\n\nAny tips for getting morale up and making sure the team still trusts us?\n\nTypically the staff would be brought down by an employee who wasn’t pulling their weight but in this case - the time issue really only impacted their clients, the front desk team, and the bottom line. So I don’t think the other stylists were privy to the extent of the issue.",

          "body": "That’s one of the hardest versions of letting someone go, especially when they’re genuinely likeable and not malicious. It messes with your head because emotionally it feels like a betrayal even when rationally you know it wasn’t sustainable. Being surprised is also pretty common. People often hear the conversations but don’t really internalize that the line is getting closer.\n\nIn a small team like that, I’ve found that trust usually comes more from how consistent you are afterward than from how perfectly you explain the decision. You don’t have to convince them the firing was justified, just show that expectations are clear and applied the same way to everyone. I’ve noticed morale dips more when leadership seems uneasy or apologetic than when they’re calm and grounded about a tough call.\n\nI started privately noting situations like this because over time you realize patterns around performance issues versus personality and it helps you show up steadier the next time. Curious whether your team has been reacting more with worry or more with sadness, those usually need very different responses.",

Do they Get it, Want it and the Capacity to do it.  Often times someone says they want it but they just aren't capable or never get it or any combination of the 3.

She started off great (everyone is a rockstar the first couple weeks, right?). A few months in, I noticed the door to my suite opening like clock work around the half hour mark when she would take a 15-20 minute restroom break (every hour). This has irritated me a great deal and evidently she read my irritation and started opening and closing the door very softly so I could not hear it. This irritated me even more. She continues to use the bathroom probably 1.5 to 2.0 hours per work day. Today, I walked into her office and she had her feet propped up on a second chair and was sitting far away from her monitors. As soon as I said something she sprung up (evidently she was \"resting her eyes\"). What should I do here? I need the help but she is starting to slip? How do I document here file if I want to terminate here without paying her unemployment?",

We had done the same merchandise last year, kept the same pricing, offered free delivery. They came back and asked if I could do the job at almost half of what I quoted. I said I couldn’t do it at that price but I would offer an additional discount. Then they ghosted me.\n\nWhat in the world am I supposed to do? They always try to beat me down in price.

One was from a small project company that only worked with subcontractors and had only been around for two or three years. The other was from a long-established construction company.\n\nSo she played the two companies off against each other.\n\nShe told the second company the first company's quoted price to try and drive the price down.  \nThen she told the first company the second company's new quote, and the second company lowered its price again.  \nShe repeated this several times until the price had dropped drastically.  \nI warned her! There's a limit! Everything has its price. If you push it too far, the company will end up cutting corners on quality, etc.\n\nAs expected, the second construction company stopped the price negotiations, saying: \"We can't reduce the price any further without compromising on quality, and we won't do that. After all, we have to protect our reputation.\" If tyou still want it cheaper, good luck.\n\nThe project company, on the other hand, drastically reduced the price again.  \nShe asked me for advice:\n\nI replied:  \n1. Price shouldn't be the deciding factor!  \n2. The second company was honest and reputable.  \n3. The project company will undercut every price, and then pass this price pressure on to their subcontractors. It's predictable that this will lead to problems.\n\nTake the offer from the, in my opinion, reputable local construction company.\n\nBut she decided otherwise. After the project company threw in a free open fireplace, which was originally supposed to cost €16,000, she chose that company.  \nLuckily, I was able to persuade her to agree to 30 installments, essentially one payment per week. This keeps the risk of loss low.\n\nIt happened as probably everyone expected:  \nDuring the shell construction phase, she paid another installment of €12,000 on Friday.  \nOn Monday, the various subcontractors arrived at the construction site, loaded materials and tools, and were about to leave.They hadn't been paid for two weeks.  \nThe project company had filed for bankruptcy!\n\nOnly then did she begin researching the company and find other affected homeowners. Among other things, the managing director had already filed for bankruptcy three times and then started over under a new name.\n\nNow she was stuck with a half-finished shell of a house. Fortunately, her loss amounted to \"only\" €12,000, which she claimed in court.  \nAfterward, she had to negotiate directly with all the subcontractors and pay them so that the work could be completed. Friends and relatives also had to step in to keep the losses to a minimum.\n\nAs a result, the completion of the house was delayed by almost 12 months! She couldn't afford the exterior plastering for another two years. The final price increased by approximately 45% compared to the original quote. And all of this certainly caused her several sleepless nights.  \nShe would have been better off building with the construction company that wouldn't be blackmailed.\n\nAs a reputable company, you have to be able to say \"NO!\"  \nThe simplest way:  \nYou want us to reduce the price even further?  \nOkay, suggest where we should cut corners on quality!  \nYou're the business owner! You also have a responsibility. Your company, your prices.  \nSo  your prices should be well-calculated.  \nAnd \"well-calculated\" in this case means there's a Price floor you can't go below.",

          "body": "Enforcing price changes with current and loyal customers is always a challenge. \n\nWhat I've found from working on the financial and sales side of corporate is that you can avoid most of the pain by being very communicative, and keeping up good followup service after the sale. \n\nThe fear is always the same and it's understandable: \"If I raise my prices/don't kowtow to pressure, they'll just go to my competitor.\"\n\nMaybe. Maybe not. \n\nWhat I recommend everyone does, regardless up if you have an upcoming price change, or renegotiation or not:\n\n- Always keep in contact with your customers. Regular newsletters are great. Keep them informed with what you're doing and ideally \"here are new ways we can serve you.\" Make them simple, short, readable, informative. \n- Ask for the price increase before they ask for your discount. \"Due to recent tariffs, import costs, commodities price increase, etc...we unfortunately have had to increase prices. We've worked hard to keep all other costs the same and have even implemented ways to keep them down, however, we are still unable to provide the current pricing.\" (or something like that). \n- Discounts are up to you, but if you can manage it, consider offering holding the current pricing and tacking on an additional service...or if you're contract based, request longer terms for a discount, or if it benefits your cash situation, discount them if they pay ahead all at once (if your business model works this way). \n\nAlways train others how you want them to treat you. This is true for personal interactions as it is for business. If you give up 20% one year, they're going to hope to get it again in year 2; If you do it in year 2, they're going to expect it every year. \n\nBut most of all - always work in the best interest of your company, not your customer. If your company dies, you don't get that customer anyway. \n\n***\n\nStory time:\n\nGo back to like 30 years ago. I was only a kid then but, my current day job company made the fatal mistake of having about 40% of its business and capacity sunk into one national customer. We only provided one product to this customers and it was good. \n\nThis customer, when it came up to renegotiate, put the business up for bid and a competitor came in and put their hat in the ring. \n\nAt the time, we were like a $50M business, probably less. This competitor was a $1B business. \n\nThe customer, who's name rhymes with \"Ball Fart\", as you might expect began to put us in the vise. \n\nThe competitor, a well-diversified company came in with a price that we knew made the product a loss leader for them. The strategy was to work with that customer to get distribution for other products in the portfolio. \n\nWe were not diversified. We were/are very efficient at making this product, but we couldn't hit that price. Ball Fart gave us a final target. If we hit it we would no longer need to compete and they'd close the bid.\n\nIt was very low. We had until the next monday at 10am to tell them our decision.\n\nOn that Friday, our head of Finance and Accounting, who was like a 30 year old, was tasked to spend the weekend and project the scenarios so we knew how to proceed. He built the P&amp;Ls and the full business case for each. \n\nEven though this would chew up a ton of overhead and give us room to play around with price elsewhere, ultimately, this customer, who was 40% of our business, would devastate our P&amp;L. The operating expenses dwarfed revenues and we couldn't shift cost or price enough anywhere to make up for it. \n\nSo that Monday. 10AM. President gets on the phone with the head of accounting and the buyer at Ball Fart with the decision. \n\nHe muted the buyer and asked for that final confirmation: \"Are you sure that this is the right move? No turning back.\" Accounting head confirmed it. \n\n\"Hey Ball Fart Buyer. We can't hit your price. Our final price is $X.XX\"\n\nWe lost the business. We now had 50% vacant capacity, roughly 40% less revenue, and a whole lot of overhead to suddenly chew up. We couldn't distribute it to the other customers. \n\nWe had to let go a ton of people. We had to board up a part of the plant because it was too expensive to run/inspect for nothing. We had to revisit how we acquire customers because we simply didn't have enough. \n\nBut the alternative was worse: the company would have folded. Because we were foolish enough to keep Ball Fart around at 40% of our business - we couldn't afford to use them as a loss leader. \n\nToday - we learned lots of lessons and our biggest customer is something like 5% of our business. Most of all, however, we knew that as painful as it might be, kowtowing to a painful price request would have given us another 6-12 months before we were done.",

      "selftext": "As an employee at several companies over the years I was frustrated with the terrible, toxic culture, lack of structure, lack of clear boundaries, roles or expectations, the inefficiencies, etc. Once I had gained significant experience in the field, I went into consulting as a way to both get out from under the mess and potentially help companies change the way the operate.\n\nEven in roles as a director, I was hardly ever listened to in terms of what need to change or how, so I felt that I needed to be an outsider to actually get the owner's ear.\n\nAnd to a degree, this works. But honestly, it's really only at the larger and more corporate companies where I ever feel like anything I do actually gets put into place.\n\nhere are some of the pitfalls I see over and over again in small business:\n\n\\- Owners consumed by fear and paranoia. They keep a lot of info that isn't proprietary under wraps as if no one can be trusted with it, and then employees can't do their jobs because they don't have all of the information and tools they need. Even keeping different departments siloed from each other because they are afraid of them \"talking to each other\", when collaboration is necessary to complete the work. When employees leave in droves, whether to a competitor or to start their own enterprise, it usually isn't because they came in with that intention. Most people would prefer to stay at a job if it is tolerable rather than risk another unknown. So if you constantly hemorrhage staff, it is due to the toxic work environment, burnout, lack of feeling like they can do anything purposeful with the company.\n\n\\- constantly moving the goals posts, setting employees up for failure, and needing to be \"the only one who does anything right\". I have watched countless times as owners give 30% of the tools needed to do the job to someone, then call them into the office to ask why they didn't complete it the way they were never trained to and didn't have the necessary tool or information to do so. Then they often go on a rant that they can't trust anyone, no one wants to work anymore, no one know what they are doing. Yes, that last one is often true, and it's often the owner's fault. Later they reveal some document or file or tool or instruction that the employee would have need to complete the task, which now has to be redone in a waste of everyone's time and energy, but the owner still wants the employee to grovel about what a huge mistake they made.\n\n\\- zero accountability while constantly blaming other. I can't count on all my fingers and toes the number of times an owner was in the middle of berating someone for an error, then it is found that something was signed or submitted by the owner and it was their mistake, only to have them then go on a big showy rant \" WHO SIGNED MY NAME? WHO DID THIS?\". You lose respect and credibility when you want to constantly call out everyone else but can never own up to anything.\n\n\\-no real process for onboarding or continued education. Just slapping an additional title onto a grunt worker who seems to fear losing their job more than stroking out from running half the company for minimum wage, and calling it a day.  So now Gary is also HR on top of 3 other titles, as you send new employees to him and expect him to figure it out with no guidance, then will yell at Gary when you find out there isn't the full blown new employee training happening that you didn't actually hire a full time HR employee or HR consultant to build and put into place. And you wonder why people keep leaving after a couple months. No, they aren't all \"lazy people who don't want to work\". They literally never felt like part of the company or had a sense of their role, because there as no true onboarding or training.\n\n\\-no structure in general. No sense of project management, no debriefing to improve regular operations. Every day is like doing triage on passengers of a train that just derailed. Day after day after day. Everything feels on the fly, at the whims of the owner/owners, never forms into something more cohesive.\n\nThe majority if the small businesses I have attempted to help still ran like start ups even if they were 5, 10, 20 years old. And that's why they stay small and don't get anywhere. It isn't your marketer, it isn't the economy, it is most likely the owner.\n\nAnd the grand finale of all of this is, they seldom even let me come in and do my job either. They don't really want anything to change. At least I don't work for them, but it's gotten to the point where it's even getting too exhausting to work WITH them. I identify where changes are needed then they tell me they don't want to or can't change that because of XYZ. I still get paid either way, but it's really not fulfilling at all to just collect checks from tyrants for advice they won't use. I'd rather help companies actually put these things into action and improve.\n\nPlease, if you are a small business owner: recognize your areas of non-expertise, hire people into those roles, allow them to actually do their jobs, stop thinking you do everything perfectly and better than everyone in every department (you don't, and you look silly marching around micromanaging everyone while actually making things worse in your wake), show appreciation toward your employees instead of contempt, stop trying to control every detail and focus on being captain of the ship, taking it in a direction instead of spinning in circles.",

Need some help if possible.  \n  \nI run a small family business in Serbia (e-commerce / DIY / accessories niche) that’s starting to deal with more and more formal requirements (we used to sell domestically and in US, but now we've entered european markets and things have really taken off), so I’m clearly realizing that tax and compliance issues are really complex af. Between different jurisdictions and documentation it's becoming increasingly difficult to know what to do, especially if you're not in EU =(.\n\nThings I’m currently trying to deal with:\n\n* Whether I need to worry about e-invoicing compliance now or if that’s only a problem once you hit a certain size?\n* When and why a tax clearance certificate is actually required (banks? partners? government contracts?) And when it's not nessesary?\n* If sales tax advisory services are worth paying for vs just dealing with it yourself?\n* Whether a one-off consultation tax session with a specialist is enough, or if this is an ongoing relationship throughout my entire business career?\n\n**Not trying** to dodge anything - just don’t want to overpay or overcomplicate thing. Right now it feels like there’s a huge gap between 100% DIY and 100% outsource solutions.\n\nSo… for those who’ve been through this:  \nWhat did you actually outsource, what did you keep in-house (and why?)\n\nFWIW, I’m looking to avoid future pain, not chase perfection or smthn like that.   \n  \nThanks!!",

Deciding which processes to optimize first finance, sales, HR, marketing can be overwhelming. But even small workflow or strategy adjustments can have a massive impact when applied in the right areas.\n\nI’ve found that businesses that start by mapping their operations often uncover inefficiencies that are surprisingly easy to fix. Sometimes the changes are procedural, like automating repetitive tasks. Other times, it’s strategic, like identifying which revenue streams are underperforming. External advisors or structured frameworks can help owners prioritize these improvements efficiently, avoiding trial-and-error losses.\n\nFor others here: what approaches have worked best for you in streamlining your business? Do you rely on experimentation, or have you sought external expertise? I’d love to hear examples of changes that had the biggest measurable impact on growth or efficiency.

If you want to be different, you can’t operate how everyone else does. Here is what I have done and it has helped tremendously. \n\n1) Be slow to hire and quick to fire. Set the tone and expectations up front and don’t deviate. Remember, one bad employee can ruin the culture  and atmosphere. You have to cut out the cancer before it kills the body. \n\n2) Maintain boundaries. We can be friends/family after work. During work, there has to be an owner/employee professional decorum. \n\n3) Everything is transparent. From individual employee salaries to business operating expenses.   Everything is on a tv in the break room and is updated in real time. \n\n4) Employees are paid their respective rate. However, there are several ways they can earn additional commissions. There is also an account that they can earn biannual bonuses from. Everything is posted in real time and allows the employees to have a vested interest in how the company performs. If the company does well, everyone does well. \n\n5) Having systems will change the way you operate. The business will thrive or fail based on the systems you implement. Also don’t be afraid to revise or add systems as needed. However, you must be consistent once they are implemented. \n\nSelf employment isn’t for the faint of heart. Once you get a taste for it, you’ll never be able to work for someone else again. At the end of the day, you are your own worst enemy. You got this!",
