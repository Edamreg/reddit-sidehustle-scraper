I agree with the paid ad campaign suggestion in the comment, basically become the media buyer and run the ad platform, but it requires a lot of time and investment and it's harder to convince people to take chance on a complete newbie with their money for ads. So either work under someone who's experienced, cuz u will learn it faster in a practical setting, message a top freelancer and offer to assist them in their work and in return you'll sit through their strategy discussion on how to choose creatives etc etc, it's a whole different area but within 3-4 months you'll be very much capable of landing your own clients.  \nStart on Fiverr or Upwork for the above.\n\nFor smaller side income while you build the main thing, survey and PTE apps can get you $200-250/month. I use Prolific and Babki. It's not much but it helps while you're ramping up the bigger income sources, and esp. with surveys once you get consistent and start getting invites to better surveys, it's a solid source of extra income for some people.\n\nAll in all pick one main skill to learn and freelance it. Don't try to do 10 different things at once or you won't get good at any of them.\n\nAlso it depends on things that you may naturally be good at, so spend time figuring that out",

This is my main source of income now as I do not have to stress about getting people to view my videos as I use ads to earn revenue from yt channels and I have upto 10 channels.

      "selftext": "Ninety days ago, I hit publish without a plan.\n\nNo niche.  \nNo funnel.  \nNo clear outcome.\n\nJust a promise to myself:\n\n**Write every day. Tell the truth. See what happens.**\n\nHere is what actually happened.\n\n\n\n## 1. Consistency Is the Real Differentiator\n\nIdeas are everywhere.  \nMotivation fades fast.\n\nShowing up every day is rare.\n\nMost newsletters die after five issues.  \nSome after ten.  \nAlmost none survive boredom.\n\nWriting daily forces momentum. Even bad days count. Especially bad days.\n\nMomentum compounds quietly.\n\n\n\n## 2. You Do Not Need a Niche to Start\n\nI wrote about:\n- Games  \n- Debt  \n- Kids  \n- AI  \n- Side hustles  \n- Being tired  \n- Being lost  \n\nPeople still subscribed.\n\nWhy? Because clarity comes later.  \nVoice comes first.\n\nYour niche finds you while you show up.\n\n\n\n## 3. Honesty Beats Polish Every Time\n\nThe most replies came from emails where I admitted:\n- I was stuck  \n- I was broke  \n- I did not know what to build next  \n- I was exhausted  \n\nPerfect writing gets skimmed.  \nHonest writing gets read.\n\nPeople do not connect with success.  \nThey connect with struggle in motion.\n\n\n## 4. Writing Creates Direction You Cannot Think Your Way Into\n\nBefore the newsletter, my head was noisy.\n\nToo many ideas.  \nToo many directions.\n\nWriting forced decisions.\n\nEvery sentence clarified what mattered.  \nEvery issue narrowed the signal.\n\nAction creates clarity. Not the other way around.\n\n\n## 5. You Learn What Resonates Only by Publishing\n\nI thought some topics would hit. They did nothing.\n\nI wrote throwaway thoughts that sparked replies, shares, and signups.\n\nYou cannot predict resonance from your head.\n\nYou discover it in public.\n\n\n\n## 6. Momentum Is Fragile. Protect It Aggressively\n\nSkipping one day feels harmless.\n\nIt is not.\n\nSkipping breaks the streak.  \nBreaking the streak kills momentum.  \nMomentum is everything.\n\nSome days I wrote at 3 AM.  \nSome days I wrote tired.  \nSome days I wrote with nothing interesting to say.\n\nThose days mattered most.\n\n\n\n## 7. Writing Builds Trust Before It Makes Money\n\nNinety days in, I did not get rich.\n\nBut something better happened.\n\nPeople trusted me.\n\nThey replied.  \nThey asked questions.  \nThey shared ideas.  \nThey followed my projects.\n\nTrust is the asset.  \nMoney follows trust.\n\n\n\n## 8. Your Life Is Content If You Pay Attention\n\nI stopped hunting for ideas.\n\nLife provided them.\n\n- A bike ride  \n- A sick kid  \n- A failed product  \n- A small win  \n- A bad day  \n\nYou do not need inspiration.  \nYou need awareness.\n\n\n## 9. Building in Public Keeps You Accountable\n\nWhen people expect tomorrow’s email, quitting gets harder.\n\nThat pressure is good.\n\nIt turned writing into a habit instead of a mood.\n\nAccountability creates endurance.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Ninety Days Is Just the Beginning\n\nNothing magical happens on day ninety.\n\nNo finish line.  \nNo sudden clarity.  \nNo overnight win.\n\nBut something shifts.\n\nWriting becomes normal.  \nSharing becomes easier.  \nConfidence grows quietly.\n\nYou stop asking, “Should I keep going?”\n\nYou just keep going.\n\nI don't plan on stopping. Look for another update in 90 days when I hit 180 days of writing a daily newsletter! \n\nComment below any questions i'll answer them all! \n\n\n",

Price $50-$100 per task.\n3. **Turn repeat work into a bundle** (templates + checklist) and sell it on Whop for passive sales.\n4. **Batch once a week** (2-3 hrs) so it doesn’t bleed into family time.\n5. **Upsell retainers** after 2-3 jobs for predictable monthly income.\n\nThis avoids ads, cold calls, and heavy setup - just focused, repeatable wins from home.",

I remember picking one simple niche, throwing together a small site, and writing a few pages just based on stuff I was already googling myself. no grand plan, just “if I’m confused about this, someone else probably is too.”\n\nthe mistake I made early was expecting fast results. every day I’d check traffic like it was a heartbeat monitor. nothing. weeks went by and it felt dead. instead of scrapping it, I left it alone because honestly I was tired of starting over. that turned out to be the accidental win. while I was distracted with other things, that little site slowly started getting search traffic.\n\nthe first time a commission showed up, I thought it was a reporting error. it was small, but it felt unreal because I hadn’t done anything that day. then it happened again a week later. that’s when I understood what people meant by “passive” — not no work, just work done earlier finally paying rent.\n\n**Takeaway:** 2020 taught me that most online stuff doesn’t need brilliance, it needs time. if something is useful and you don’t kill it too early, it has a chance to surprise you later.",

      "selftext": "I cannot finish large important projects\n\nI cannot finish large important projects, I know this is related to my trauma and CPTSD but I’m not exactly sure how.  I basically would like to improve my life and the only way I can do. This is to accomplish large important projects and goals, but I cannot finish. I’ve been trying to do this for more than a year.\n\nI will give you some examples: \n\nIt’s really important for me to start a side business that will actually generate meaningful income. I have exact anxiety and I’ve been diagnosed as having major depression yet I force myself to work on these projects every day. in the past year I’ve tried to start two businesses. I spent roughly 4 to 5 months on each business and they are currently at the state of being about 90% ready to launch.  I have a problem finishing the other 10% so that they are ready to present to the public, advertise to obtain new users, and begin taking payments and generating income.  The reason for this is, I work so hard on these projects and I put everything into them and become obsessed with them over the period of 3 to 4 months but by the end of that timeframe I have lost faith in my original business idea and don’t feel like the ideas will be successful in the marketplace so I just pretty much finish the businesses from a technical implementation, but I never put the finishing touches and make the businesses available to the general public. Instead, I start a new business and the cycle repeats itself.  \n\nFor instance, I made a mobile app at work so hard on it to get it up and running, technically with backend website with payment and user accounts.  At the end of several months, the app is ready to launch, but I have lost faith in my original idea, and I have no confidence that will even make money. So I never launch, instead, I start a new business.  The next business is an AI startup, I spent several months learning and programming and getting everything ready for lunch. At the end of several months, I realize that I don’t like my original idea anymore and even though the business is about 90% ready for lunch, I never follow through and now I’m thinking of starting a new business with a different idea.\n\nHow can I break this pattern? I’m considering hiring an accountability coach who will check on me and give me encouragement so I actually follow through on these projects. Is this a good strategy or am I just not disciplined? any comments appreciated.  ",

          "body": "I saw you mentioned in another comment you're already in therapy which is good. This sounds less like a discipline problem and more like you're protecting yourself from potential failure by abandoning projects before they can actually fail in the real world. Getting to 90% means you can do the work, stopping at 90% means something else is blocking you.\n\nAn accountability coach might help with the practical side of actually launching but it won't fix the underlying fear that's making you lose faith in your ideas right before launch. That's the CPTSD pattern you mentioned and worth continuing to work on in therapy.\n\nOne thing that might help is launching imperfectly on purpose. Like set a hard deadline that the next project goes live at 80% ready instead of waiting for 90%. It won't be perfect but it'll break the pattern of never launching. You can always improve it after it's live.",

      "selftext": "didn’t know this until recently, but apparently any kind of side hustle here needs a proper license. freelancing, consulting, even small online stuff. which is funny because so many people are doing something on the side. i’m running a global agency, clients outside the UAE, work is fully remote… so now i’m genuinely curious where the line actually is. is this one of those rules that exists on paper but works differently in real life? or do most people eventually get a freelance / business license? just setting some context here… imin a multi country college programme, tetr, and by next month i will leave dubai and will be in sg… so what do you all think??",

I did this for a stint between jobs and it was surprisingly effective. \n\n\n Obviously it fluctuates but on average I'd probably make $100-500 a week and spent maybe 10-60mins total per week (sourcing stuff, posting it and meeting people)\n\n\n\n\nMy process:\n\n\n\n\nUse warehousewatcher.com to find Amazon warehouse deals, alot of that stuff is 40% off + and is in like new condition. If you can't find a buyer you can always return it too.\n\n\n\n\nAlso if you go directly on amazon.com enter \"warehouse deals\" in the search field, this also lets you look through their warehouse items, however they've made it increasingly hard to see what's actually in stock without clicking on the item first. Another excellent way to source product is if you're lucky enough to have online auctions with local pickup near you. You'd be surprised how cheap you can get things simply because you don't have competition.\n\n\n\n\nPlaces like maxsold.com list estate sales, auctions etc nearby Also places like canoe.com, keepa.com and camelcamelcamel.com are useful for finding lightning deals to flip as well. Just check camelcamelcamel to see how much it's worth regularly.\n\n\n\n\nRules, always meet in public, preferably somewhere you can get to within 2 mins or less. And never leave until they say they've arrived. This way you don't actually waste any time if people decide to ghost you (which will happen)",

      "selftext": "Hi.. i'm a 16 year old and i guess i'm just writing this because i don't have anyone else to talk to. I go to school from 8am to 1 and after that my day is basically empty most of the time. Since the pandemic, my life hasn't really been interesting at all. I don't have any friends to hang out with or spend time with so i'm always just by myself. Most of my time goes into scrolling reels or randomly learning things online, mostly related to finance. Finance is one of the few things that genuinely interests me. Sometimes I just sit and think about money, businesses, how people make it, how systems work. I know that might sound weird for my age but that's just how it is.\n\nI tried flipping game accounts for almost 8 months. I didn't have any money to start with so I couldn't buy accounts and resell them. Instead I used to promote other people's resell accounts with their permission for a small commission or for a cheap account worth the commission. I actually did sell around 3-4 accounts but I never received my commission as the account owners eventually ghosted or straight up scammed me.\n\nAnother problem was that I didn't own the accounts. I didn't have the login ids or passwords so when buyers asked for proof I couldn't log in and show them which I completely understand from their side. Because of this I couldn't sell many accounts and after months of trying I ended up earning nothing.\n\nStill, one thing I can honestly say is that during those 8 months, I never scammed a single person. Even when I could have. Even when I was frustrated. That might sound small but it matters to me.\n\nRight now, I have a lot of free time and the thought of making money is always in my head. Not big money. Not some crazy income. Even a couple of dollars would mean a lot to me, just to know I can earn something on my own.\n\nSince I'm under 18, I don't have a bank account yet. I also don't want to use my parents' money or their bank accounts. I want whatever I earn to be completely mine. So I made a cryppto wallet to receive payments, and if I ever need to cash out, I transfer it to my cousin's wallet since he's above 18.\n\nMy parents don't even know I'm trying to do side hustles. I have always had this dream of surprising them one day with my first earnings no matter how small and gifting them something valuable with money I made myself.\n\nI'm not lazy. I'm not looking for shortcuts. I'm just.. lost. I have time and i'm willing to learn and I genuinely want to be financially independent even if it starts very small.\n\nIf anyone here understands my situation or has realistic side hustle ideas for someone my age with no capital, i would really appreciate your advice.\n\nThanks for reading this.",

If neighbors know you show up every storm, same window, no surprises, that builds trust fast.

You already know your favorite retailer’s patterns. Patterns are important. If you have a retirement plan then you can see how they swing trade as well. Even drug dealers buy low and sell high.\n\n2. Sales - Learn to sell times right way. Power of persuasion is a valuable tool. Works a million times better when you are actually selling to folks with good intent. \n\n3. Learn to Earn - Lets make one fact clear: money does not exist. You must work for everything special and terrible in life. That’s part of the plan. The knowledge you take in and translate that to action is a major building block in your journey.\n\nWhen you’re out shopping, make sure to comb through the clearance section of every store you go to you. What can you resell? Plan trips for thrifting and garage sales. I still do that.\n\nThe process of you putting in the time planning and executing great strategies coupled with who you meet is priceless.\n\nWhen you go to a new town on vacation or just stopping by, place yourself as a person that is planning on moving there and speak to people. Actually listen to what they say, suggest, what they do for a living, etc… Build relationships. Travel as much as you can.\n\nI can go on and on since I have done so much in my life to create “passive income”.\n\nWork hard, and do it with great intent and you will make 80% of your adventures work out.\n\nWhen you see or come up with a new idea, attack it passionately to see if it will work. Don’t quit until you are forced to pivot meaning you maxed out your returns. Don’t just quit just to quit.",

          "body": "IMO, there isn’t really a single “skill” that leads to passive income. What works is learning how to package something you’re good at and getting it in front of the right people.\n\nThat “something” can sit anywhere on a spectrum:\n\n\t•Services (tutoring, proofreading, childcare) → more active, easier to start\n\n\t•Digital products (printables, templates) → create once, sell repeatedly\n\n\t•Content/affiliates → slower burn, more scalable\n\nServices usually require more hands-on effort, but they’re a great entry point. For example, tutoring or kids’ activities are best marketed in parent spaces — PTA groups, school newsletters, community boards, libraries, coffee shops near schools, etc.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I made cootie catchers out of flyers advertising myself as a mother’s helper and handed them out at our community pool. My mom shared them through PTA connections. That’s not advanced marketing — it’s just knowing where your audience already is and when they’re mentally open to noticing your offer.\n\nPrintables sit closer to the “passive” end. You create them once (worksheets, planners, kids’ activities) and sell them repeatedly on sites like Etsy. But it’s saturated, so discovery still matters. You don’t need to be a marketing expert — just understand the basics of SEO, algorithms, and when /your/ audience is active.\n\nIf you’re product- or lifestyle-focused (beauty, fashion, fitness, home), affiliate links (Amazon, LTK, “link in bio”) are another route. Same principle, different channel.\n\nThe closest thing to passive income comes after upfront effort: build once, market intentionally, then let systems and word of mouth take over.",

What is actually working for everyone else here because I am tired of seeing posts about dropshipping and amazon fba like those are passive when they are clearly not",

One is to invest money and two is to have a business that gives you money. \n\nAfter that sure there are several small ways here and there but you will find that in order to actually generate considerable income you would either have to spend money or make a business, or both.\n\nIf you have around 300k in stocks you could make around 90k every 3 years approximately which is around 10%, and that if the stocks make sense. I suppose you don’t have that money so what’s left is actually building a business that you could automate later on, but even then, the minute something goes wrong, it turns to active income.\n\nIn other words, you either have a capital upfront (stocks, property even, etc) and make money on returns or you either  build a business that holds value and lasts. To me everything else is scam or pennies at best.",

It's not passive at all, but eventually, you can outsource editing, thumbnails, and scripting.\n\nI've done this with the Tom Blake channel and it's been a great business that becomes more passive each year.

Stuff like content + monetization (blogs, YouTube, niche sites), simple digital products, or automation-friendly services. For example, niche websites with affiliate links or ads can start slow but compound once they rank. Same with YouTube or Shorts tied to a clear niche.\n\nAnother solid path is building or licensing something small but useful, like templates, scripts, prompts, Notion setups, or simple tools. You put the work in upfront, then sell it repeatedly. Even $10–$20 products don’t need many sales per day to hit that goal.\n\nReselling and arbitrage can work too, but it’s usually less passive and more operational. Good for cash flow, not always for freedom.\n\nThe biggest mistake is chasing “set it and forget it” from day one. Most things need a few weeks or months of effort before they level off. Pick one thing, commit to it, and optimize instead of jumping between ideas. That’s usually what gets people to consistent $100 days.",

Made little spikes of income here and there, nothing sustainable, nothing I could confidently grow.\n\nWhat finally started working was treating one thing like an actual product business instead of a quick win. I’d been curious about SaaS but assumed it was too “serious” compared to easy hustles. The only reason I even tried was seeing a bunch of small, bootstrapped SaaS case studies in [foundertoolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) that started from where I was: no audience, no funding, just skills and time. The difference with this route was that the first dollars I made were from people paying monthly for something that actually solved a problem, not a one-off trick. I followed a validation and launch sequence I found there: weekend idea tests, pre-sell a tiny group, launch across 20+ small channels instead of only one big platform, then commit to a few months of content to keep traffic coming.\n\nMy first product is nothing crazy. It’s a simple niche tool solving one specific workflow headache. MRR is just over $1,200 right now, but psychologically it’s a different world from one-time hustles. Revenue comes in every month without having to constantly find new buyers from scratch. The biggest surprise was realizing I didn’t need some viral idea or massive audience, just a boring, well-executed system. Seeing dozens of people turn that system into $1–10K MRR made it feel less like a gamble and more like a skill I could learn. It’s still work, but it finally feels like I’m building an asset instead of chasing the next tactic.",

You could buy some of the cheaper books and up charge them when reselling. Like I saw a book online for $20, that cost $200 at like Walmart. As long as they are more affordable than the brand new copies, and you build a reputable reputation, people might pay more than the cheapest option if they know that they can trust the seller.\n\nYou could work with college students, because colleges tend to upcharge a crazier amount than regular stores.

It’s stacking predictable, boring wins that already work.\n\nHere’s a realistic breakdown that doesn’t rely on luck or “going viral”:\n\n1. Sell a skill or task you can do today\nNot next month. Today.\nExamples that convert fast:\n\nSimple design (Canva thumbnails, resumes, IG posts)\n\nWriting (product descriptions, captions, rewriting AI text)\n\nTech help (website fixes, setup, basic automation)\n\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert. You need to solve one small problem and price it clearly.\n\n2. Price for speed, not perfection\n$100–$200 offers move faster than $10 ones.\n5 people paying $200 = you’re basically there.\n\nMost people fail because they underprice and overwork.\n\n3. Go where buyers already are (don’t “build an audience”)\n\nReddit (help-first replies, no pitching)\n\nFacebook groups\n\nTwitter/X replies\n\nLocal businesses that already spend money\n\n\nOne solid message to the right person beats 100 posts.\n\n4. Sell something digital once if you’re short on time If you can package knowledge you already have into:\n\na short guide\n\nchecklist\n\nstep-by-step system\n\n\nYou can sell it multiple times without extra work. This is how people hit very specific numbers fast.\n\nI struggled with the same “I need money now” pressure, so I wrote a short, practical guide breaking down:\n\nwhat actually converts fast\n\nhow to price so people say yes\n\nwhere to post without sounding salesy\n\n\nNot hype, just execution. If that sounds useful, it’s linked on my profile.\n\nEither way, focus on speed + clarity, not complexity. That’s how you hit $972 instead of chasing $9.72.",

We have had to earn extra income through DoorDash, but it’s not always available for us and income from that has dwindled. She drives and I just pick up the food and drop it off. I cannot drive because I am incredibly scared to, and the amount of reckless drivers in my city have put me off of even wanting to try to learn how to drive. \n\nI do have a really good PC that we got a while back which has the 12GB Nvidia RTX 5070, 64GB of RAM, and 2TB of Storage space. I point this out because I figure there is something I can do with my PC. It’s powerful enough for image generation, RVC, and can even run some LLMs locally. My problem is that I do not know where to go or start. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nThanks for reading.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche.\n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1.\t⁠start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n2.\t⁠once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n3.\t⁠once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course.\n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you.\n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

I’m nowhere near quitting my day job, but it’s solid extra income I can work on in my spare time while building a catalog of content that keeps selling.\n\nIt’s adult ebooks. NSFW. Turns out there’s real demand.\n\nI sell across multiple storefronts and slowly build a reader base that follows my work. About half of my process uses AI, but the other half is creativity and editing. If you rely only on AI, you get buried in low-quality content fast.\n\nThis is very niche, and most people don’t make much. But it is possible. From what I’ve seen, there are quite a few people doing very well in this space.\n\nI also sell custom stories. They take more work, even with partial AI assistance, but I’ve made almost $2,000 this year from just five of those commissions.\n\nEdit: I learned everything through authormeta.com (the Erotica Author QuickStart Guide)",

It’s usually work now, lighter work later.\n\nThat said, here are the most realistic options people actually make work:\n\nDigital products\nGuides, templates, checklists, simple tools. You do the work once, then improve it over time. Not instant, but repeatable.\n\nContent + affiliates\nWriting posts, answering questions, or making short content that links to tools you genuinely use. Slow at first, compounds later.\n\nRoyalties / licensing\nStock photos, music, designs, or assets. Very competitive, but low maintenance once uploaded.\n\nAutomation of an active skill\nTurning something you already do (freelancing, consulting, teaching) into a template, resource, or product.\n\n\nAnything that claims “fully passive with no effort” is usually just selling the idea, not the income.\n\nIn my experience, the closest thing to passive income comes from building something small that keeps working even when you’re not actively chasing people.\n\nCurious what others here consider “passive”.

          "body": "If anything, learn a hard skill/career that you can practice and make money solely on. Writing, video editing, digital marketing, web development. It's best to focus on one, but you will likely find yourself having to do other things around it, which does give a good platform for later on should you wish to go down those routes. \n\nStart with those and build around it, a lot of the less tangible skills will come through your own understanding and maturity. For instance, copywriting requires the ability to research, and also doing it to create your own understanding (especially now with AI lowering the bar a bit). \n\nI started with writing articles, and that led me into copywriting. I learned how SEO worked, how to monetise blogs and websites, how to communicate with potential clients. That's just one line of work, but it's just an example of how you can branch out your skills and insight the further you go. \n\nIt's better to start slow and steady as well with these, go into it with the idea of becoming good at what you do, rather than making money. The competition is massive online, but excelling and standing out is what gives longevity from my experience. Most of my opportunities have come from people seeing the quality of my work and the results, rather than me having to hard sell to them. \n\nAlso, you should consider attitudes more than anything. Be patient, put the effort in, don't make shortcuts and become resilient. It takes time to get anywhere reasonable, and you need to temper your expectations at times, but the success cut through eventually and that's what you need to focus on.\n\nEdit: Just realised this was the passive income sub, not the one I thought it was. A lot of this still rings true, but focus on a niche you're interested in and build something around that. You can practice skills easily, you will understand the market/industry/topic better and you will have an easier time getting the ball rolling.",

      "selftext": "I posted this to another sub and got some really good insights. I kind of wanted to see if anyone on this sub had something else to add.\n\nA few months ago, I started seeing some posts in my Instagram feed about the massive potential of making money EASILY by selling digital products (courses, PDFs, ebooks) and promoting them on Instagram. \n\nI wasn’t desperate for money or trying to escape a job I hated. I just thought it might be a reasonable way to bring in some extra income to help with my tuition. The way it was framed made it sound low effort and practical. I figured: what the hell? For a few hours a day, it seems lucrative enough.\n\nI also didn’t want to start by creating my own products, so I went the route they all recommend at the beginning. I bought 2 of these MRR courses that you can resell. I spent hundreds of dollars thinking it would pay off and that I was being smart by skipping the hard part and getting courses i can resell instead of spending time and effort creating sth from scratch (also one of their selling points). Looking back, that was incredibly naive.\n\nIt's really frustrating how misleading the whole thing is. They never talk about how time consuming it actually is to create content consistently, figure out the algorithms, write captions, film videos, edit, post, engage on Instagram. It is not a side hustle. It is a very demanding business.. Not to mention the fact that Instagram is soo random sometimes with how it pushes content. So you're basically stuck performing for the algorithm like a puppet.\n\nThey also make it feel so urgent!! If you don’t start now, you’ll be too late. If you don’t buy the course today, you’re missing your chance. That pressure is constant and intentional.\n\nAnd then there are the hidden costs. The DM automation tools, the monthly storefront fees for Stan or Beacon, and all the other monthly subscriptions that somehow never get mentioned upfront. It adds up quickly, especially for something that is marketed as low risk and easy.\n\nTo top ot off, these people selling courses act like they figured it out overnight. In reality, they took months or years to build an audience and credibility. But that part is quietly skipped over while they sell the idea that anyone can do this fast with minimal effort.\n\nI’m not saying no one makes money doing this. I’m just saying the way it’s marketed is incredibly deceptive and preys on people’s vulnerability and optimism. I really wish I had figured this all out before I spent money on this! I feel disillusioned and cheated by this whole scheme. Now I don't even want to pursue this any further because I now fully understand how time-consuming and unpredictable Instagram can be, even though I dropped a lot of money expecting an easy side hustle!\n\nYou might be wondering why I even ventured into this in the first place. I obviously fell for their empty promises and false hope. I also went into this hoping for an \"easy\" way to make money, and I was genuinely clueless enough to actually think thus would be simple and effortless. But that's on me!!\n\nThat’s it. I just needed to vent. I'm not playing martyr and I'm not fishing for sympathy. I just needed an outlet and to see how many other people made the same mistake I did. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk 😅 ",

After two weeks of minimal engagement, I realized that rushing to sell something without offering true value only left me feeling more defeated. Eventually, when I took the time to connect with my audience, asking them about their challenges and sharing useful insights, I saw a significant shift in engagement.

Once it's up, it just... works. Even when I'm too drained to leave bed.\nPassive income for people like us isn't about fancy funnels.

          "body": "That actually really resonated with me. What you described is the part of “passive income” people almost never talk about — not freedom yachts, but stability when your brain just won’t cooperate.\n\nThe way you framed it, building for your worst days instead of your best ones, is honestly the smartest strategy I’ve heard. It explains why digital products work so well when they’re done right. You’re not selling hype, you’re selling relief, clarity, or a shortcut you wish you’d had yourself.\n\nAnd the fact that it compounds quietly is huge. No algorithms to chase, no being “on,” no pressure to perform when you’re already drained. Just something useful living out there doing its job.\n\nI think a lot of people underestimate how powerful that model is, especially for creators who deal with anxiety, burnout, or inconsistent energy. You proved that you don’t need to be loud, visible, or constantly present to build something meaningful and sustainable.\n\nReally glad you shared this — it’s motivating in a very grounded, real way.",

It would get extremely boring to wake up everyday and read “401k or index funds,” “401k or index funds” but for the the dominant socioeconomic cohort here there really isn’t anything else.

I don’t use Reddit often, but I came across this community while looking info up and decided to stop by to ask some questions. \n\nSo, I have a year until I’m 18, which I plan to move out by then to live with my boyfriend. Me and him will likely stay with his grandma until we get on our feet and get an apartment. Neither me or my boyfriend have a job, but I think I have enough time to start working on getting us some income?? We’re not looking for anything grand, just enough to pay for our apartment (around $50 a month, low income!!) groceries, and a few bills like WiFi and such. Hopefully that paints a decent picture!!😭\n\nI was thinking about getting into making some simple designs, weekly, and uploading them to redbubble as a side thing, while focusing on selling handmade things such as jewelry, pins, and maybe some fashion pieces on Etsy?? I’m sure there’s better options out there, but I’m more into creative works and I thought those might be nice for me to get into. I just need things that are simple enough for me to do at home, and make a decent profit!!! \n\n\n",

Do not pay anyone anything to get a job or to get a mentor or insider information. Know the signs of an MLM or common scams. Avoid extreme religion as cults often target younger folks. Go work as a waiter or cashier. They have part-time options and you’ll probably spend less hours working for that $50 than trying to start a buisness. \n\nMost products created either require income to buy the parts or highly specialized skills in creation. If they don’t, they’ll often have extremely experienced marketing competition. Save yourself the wasted steps and just get a job. Your boyfriend also should consider getting a job. Why doesn’t he currently work? Grocery stores can double as a good option as sometimes you get money off your food buys. \n\nI checked your other post (to see if you’re a bot), if you have depression to the degree you cannot work you can file for disability once you become an adult. It’s often a long and hard process so I’d recommend trying jobs first.

The role is explained, the responsibilities are listed, the culture is highlighted. But the pay is missing.\n\nSalary info matters. It helps applicants quickly understand if the role is realistic for them. It saves time for both sides. It allows candidates to honestly evaluate what they can bring to the table and decide if the role is worth pursuing.\n\nEven if you can’t share the exact amount, at least include a salary range. That alone gives clarity. From there, applicants can choose to move forward and negotiate if they believe they can deliver more value.\n\nNo one wants to go through multiple interviews only to find out the offer doesn’t align with expectations. Transparency from the start builds trust and attracts the right people.\n\nApplicants deserve clarity. And companies benefit from it too.",

Had an idea for a specialized newsletter/content product/saas-sorta-thing and it turned out to be a very nice niche.   \n  \nEndless keywords to target, very little competition, and content that I can easily scrape and aggregate into programmatic pages that stay fresh.\n\nSome rough numbers so far: \n\n* 250 pages published\n   * Each page is refreshed weekly on average\n* 90% of submitted pages indexed\n* L90 days: 1500 clicks / 1.5M impr\n* L7 days: 250 clicks / 250k impr\n   * Low CTR due to lots of obvious bot activity - many 0 click keywords with big impressions in my GSC\n* 19 DR per ahrefs. A few directory submissions to get things going and \\~10 nice organic citations\n* 150 \"user\"/newsletter signups\n\nI am happy with this progress given it is early days. There is so much more content that can be generated. I should also be able to get more momentum going when I can give more focus: I've spent only about 3-4 hours/week on it since the site has been up and running.\n\nOn one hand, I am glad that I thought about things long enough to land on this niche. On the other, I regret not getting going sooner! I was probably subscribed to this sub for at least a year or two, just sitting on the sidelines. \n\nIf you're like me and wanting to \"just start\", I couldn't recommend it more! At the very least, you will learn a lot. Best case, you will stumble onto something even bigger than you thought it would be. Regardless, you will get yourself in the mix with the power to navigate and pivot your way to success.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI launched a French travel blog in early October (2.5 months ago) documenting a month-long Brazil trip with comprehensive destination guides (Paraty, Ilha Grande, Rio, Petropolis, Belo Horizonte, Ouro Preto, São Paulo). Each page has detailed day-by-day itineraries, restaurant recommendations, transportation tips, and real pricing based on actual experiences.\n\n**Technical foundation:**\n\n* 100/100 Lighthouse score for SEO\n* Multilingual setup (FR/EN/ES/DE - French primary)\n* Mostly original photos, only authentic content (AI-assisted writing though)\n* Clean site structure with XML sitemap\n\n**Current situation:**\n\n* Almost no traffic yet on Google Analytics (expected for a new site, but still humbling!)\n* Building Pinterest presence (batch-creating pins, themed boards)\n* Planning monetization with Booking, SafetyWing, GetYourGuide affiliates\n* Considering supplementary content pages (just \"Survival Portuguese for Brazil\" and \"Budget\" pages so far)\n\n**Questions for experienced travel bloggers/SEO specialists:**\n\n1. **Content strategy:** Should I focus on creating more supplementary pages (how to plan your trip, fun facts, packing lists, playlist, video list ...) or double down on promoting existing destination content?\n2. **Traffic channels:** For travel niches in 2025, what's the realistic timeline and ROI for:\n   * Pinterest (I'm hearing 2-3 months?)\n   * Other platforms worth prioritizing?\n3. **Keyword approach:** Should I be doing specific keyword targeting for each page, or is having clear titles and relevant content enough? If targeting is necessary, should I go for broad terms like \"Brazil itinerary\" or hyper-specific like \"best restaurants Paraty colonial center\"?\n4. **Monetization timing:** Build traffic first then add affiliate links, or implement them now? I'm concerned about looking too promotional early on.\n\nI know travel blogging is highly competitive, so I'm trying to be strategic rather than just hoping for the best. Any advice from those who've successfully grown travel blogs would be hugely appreciated!",

Long messages, Robotic replies, Same flow for every follower, People can tell when they’re being “processed.”\n\nThe funnels that worked best were: Short messages, Natural language, One clear purpose per step\n\nAutomation should feel like a helpful assistant, not a chatbot \n\n&gt;Real use cases I’ve seen work\n\nDifferent creators, same principle:\nCoaches → book calls from story replies\nEducators → sell digital products via keywords\nInfluencers → qualify brand leads\nAgency owners → pre-filter inbound DMs\n\nNo hard selling.\nJust structured conversations.\n\n&gt;The biggest mindset shift\n\nCreators don’t need: More content, More posting More followers, They need better conversations.\n\nOnce the DM flow was set up properly: Replies didn’t go cold, Buyers identified themselves, Sales felt natural, not forced\n\nIf you’re a creator reading this\n\nIf you’re getting: \n“Interested”\n“How much?”\n“Can you tell me more?”\n…but nothing happens after that\nyour problem isn’t your content.\n\nIt’s the lack of a system behind the DM.\n\nHappy to answer questions or break down an example flow if helpful.\nNot selling anything here just sharing what actually worked.\n",

I think a lot of people start businesses not because they “love people,” but because they hate bad incentives, bad managers, and pointless friction.\n\nWhat usually changes is *who* you’re dealing with. When it’s your own thing, the customers you keep are the ones you actually like working with, and you can design the work to minimize the interactions you hate. That alone makes it feel way lighter, even if the money isn’t crazy.\n\nThe downside is you end up wearing every hat, which can get exhausting in a different way. A lot of solo founders I know are fine with customers, but get burned out by the admin, follow-ups, and keeping everything straight.\n\nThat’s basically why we’re building Quorum (still beta). Not to make people “love business,” but to cut down the mental overhead so running solo doesn’t feel like juggling everything in your head all day.  \n[https://usequorum.app](https://usequorum.app)\n\nSounds like you found a version of work that fits you better, which honestly matters more than chasing some ideal outcome.",

At the beginning there’s momentum, ideas flying around, telling friends what you’re building. Then at some point it’s just you, your laptop and a long stretch of decisions no one else can really help you with.\n\nWhat surprised me is that the hard part isn’t motivation, it’s uncertainty. There’s no clear signal that you’re doing the right thing, just small indicators that might mean progress or might mean nothing. Some days you feel smart and capable, other days you wonder if you’re just confidently wrong. This really hit me recently when I was reviewing my numbers and remembered I have some money saved from rollingriches that gives me a bit of runway. Instead of feeling relieved, I felt the weight of responsibility. Every decision suddenly feels louder when it’s your own money, your own time, and no safety net telling you what to do next.\n\nI’m still committed, still building still learning but I didn’t expect the mental side to be this isolating. Curious how others deal with that quiet phase where you’re not failing, not winning, just grinding alone.",

Towards the end of the story, after years of being lost at sea, you cannot comprehend how Shackleton found it in himself to remain optimistic and get the job done. \n\nReally dramatic answer but the point is you have to endure. It sucks. It takes forever. Its lonely. But like, we aren't lost at sea and hunting penguins and sleeping on ice. If we want something, we can do it. It might be painful and take way too long -- but Shackleton traversed glaciers on foot, alone, while starving to death, to save his men. You can build a company.",

It is extremely difficult to deal with the uncertainty and obstacles that you come across when you're building a company.\n\nWhile I'm grateful to have a cofounder who I can talk to when we're facing obstacles, there are times where I have to deal with the doubts in my own head.   \n  \nHere are a couple of things that have helped a lot...  \n1. Considering worst case scenario (it turns out it's not as bad as you think. I consider that whatever hardship I'm going through now is a life better lived than what I was previously doing just dreaming about building a business.)\n\n2.

You're right that it's not about motivation, it's about not knowing if what you're doing even matters yet. And when it's your own money and time on the line, every small decision feels massive because there's no boss to blame or pivot away from.\n\nWhat helped me was finding other founders to talk to, not for advice but just to vent and hear that everyone else is also in the fog. Accountability groups, Twitter DMs, random coffee chats. Just knowing other people are grinding through the same quiet phase makes it feel less isolating. Also, celebrating tiny wins (even if they feel insignificant) helps break up the monotony.\n\nThe fact that you're still showing up and building means you're doing it right.

Never do if you are unsure, research first.\n\nAbout loneliness... I hear it over and over again... and it surprises me a lot. I dreamed about it when I was an employee: to be my own employer, decide what to do, when and why. And yes, I tell myself (therefore I'm kinda isolated too) but for some reason, I don't feel any isolation at all. Also, I have users that want this and that, which makes me feel less isolated.\n\nI'm talking about myself and you and many others are different and may feel really isolated. I may suggest you to  launch as soon as possible (even with a landing page before the real product launch), talk about your idea/product/website/whatever everywhere, get feedback as soon as possible - soon you will find people need your product/features and your isolation is gone. If not, and after publishing and talking you still feel isolated and lonely - maybe you picked up a wrong idea and people don't want to talk about it, to talk to you about it, discuss it, or suggest something to be implemented.\n\nAnyway, this stage is always presented but it 100% up to you to make it as short as possible.\n\nYeah, and one more hack: set up publicly or privately available metric page: users amount, or query or what else that show you: people use your product therefore they need you.

We get along well and we both want the same long term outcome. The part that keeps me up at night is the risk side. I already own property and most of my savings are tied up there while she does not have assets yet. To get this business off the ground I would likely need to put my property on the line through a mortgage or loan and that feels very different when it is not just my idea anymore. I am trying to be honest with myself about whether this is a business concern or a relationship concern or both.  \nFor founders who started something with a partner when one person had more to lose how did you think through risk and boundaries before moving forward. I’d really appreciate any advice :)",

You can probably get everything you need for years on Facebook Marketplace from someone who tried to do this and got bored. Get a logo for $100, set up a Shopify site and you're set. The biggest expense will probably be market fees to sell your stuff locally. \n\nI'd encourage you and your GF to put in $1,000 each or whatever makes sense. Set up the LLC, get an account, business credit card (that you pay off every month). Do all that shit right and if it works, great. If it doesn't, you're fine.

But some don't and others make profitable side-gigs but not real companies.  \n\nYou're getting good feedback. Good feedback is irrelevant. Good sales are what matters. And sales beyond friends. You say local markets - not sure if you mean stores or farmer's markets. But keep those activities up. BUT you have to account for the value of the time for whoever is doing the marketing and sales. And whoever is doing the manufacturing. Pay that person what it would cost to hire a stranger for those jobs. Is there still profit? If not, it's a nice hobby. If there is plow all the profits back into the business - basically more marketing till you've maxed out your manufacturing capacity. Then spend some of that profit on ways to increase capacity a little bit. Then sell more till you max out that additional capacity etc. Keep this up till the profit is more than one of your day job income and you feel confident enough in the future to quit that job. But only one of you. \n\nAt some point you'll have to have an agreement who's going to be in charge of what activities, what decisions, what spending etc. Hash this out and WRITE IT DOWN. It may not be a legal agreement, but writing it will clarify your thinking and preserve your memory of what you agreed to. \n\nI would not put my property at risk at this point. I would not spend savings - unless I was prepared to lose it.",

For the relationship part.. would you want to have a profitable running business with an ex-partner in the future if you were to break up?

But again.. hard to negotiate that with a partner as she might see it as being unfair and it could cause relationship issues.

Start small with money you can both afford to lose, treat it like a test phase, and see if the business actually works before anyone takes on debt or secures loans against assets. If the idea is good, it should survive a slower, lower risk start. If it can’t, that’s valuable information before things get serious.\n\nIt’s also worth having an honest conversation about boundaries and worst case scenarios now, not later. What happens if it fails, what happens if you break up, who owns what, and how decisions get made. That doesn’t mean you don’t trust each other, it just means you’re being grown about it.

If the business fails, it shouldn’t destroy your life or your relationship.\n\nFor further reading, The Obstacle Is the Way by Ryan Holiday is great for handling risk and uncertainty in ventures, and Seneca’s letters on wealth and prudence offer timeless advice on knowing how much to stake and what really matters.",

      "selftext": "Used to say yes to every \"quick coffee\" or \"pick your brain\" request. Felt good. I was helpful. Building karma. Being a good guy. After 500+ free consultations over 5 years, I realized something uncomfortable:\n\n90% never implemented anything. 5% implemented poorly then blamed my advice when it didn't work. 5% succeeded but never mentioned where they got the idea. The math: roughly 500 hours × €100/hour opportunity cost = €50,000 in free consulting.\n\nReturn on investment: 0 referrals, 0 clients, 0 equity, 0 thank-yous.\n\nSo I changed approach: \"Happy to help. My consulting rate is €150/hour. First 15 minutes free to see if I can actually add value.\"\n\nWhat happened surprised me: The time-wasters disappeared immediately. The serious people paid gladly and showed up prepared. The advice I gave was sharper because I had skin in the game. Implementation rate went from \\~10% to 80%+ because paying creates commitment.\n\nUncomfortable truth I learned: Free advice often helps your ego more than the recipient. When people have even €50 invested, they actually listen and execute instead of just collecting opinions. But suggesting this feels \"greedy\" so most of us keep bleeding time into conversations that go nowhere.\n\nFor those running service businesses: how do you handle the constant \"can I pick your brain\" requests without either burning out or feeling like an asshole?",

      "selftext": "I never thought that a decision made by Trump on the other side of the world could almost shut down my business. The story went like this. On August 19, we received an email from Omniva (Estonian Post): \"Starting tomorrow, we no longer ship parcels to the USA. Please find other delivery methods.\" August 20 is a public holiday in Estonia. The US accounts for about 60% of our wall decals shipments. We started looking for a solution urgently. We asked Omniva when it would be fixed. The answer: maybe 2-3 weeks, maybe 2-3 months. Meanwhile, sticker orders from America kept coming in.\n\nWe found a solution, though it wasn't pleasant. We decided not to turn off the US on marketplaces. On Amazon, Etsy, and eBay, everything depends on your rating. The more you sell, the higher you are in search results. Losing positions we built for years in one day would be a catastrophe. So, everything that used to go via Omniva, we started sending via FedEx. This is 3 times more expensive.\n\nA week later, the second blow came. All parcels generated before the 20th but handed over to Omniva afterward were returned. That was 70 packages. We finished September with a serious loss. Simply because delivery ate up everything. But we started to adapt.\n\nIt turned out that small stickers could be sent to the US in envelopes with a stamp they went through. This lowered costs slightly. In October, we managed to raise prices by about $5, fortunately, competitors did the same. The month ended with a small loss, but better than September.\n\nI want to clarify one thing: this was not the fault of the Estonian post (Omniva). Their systems were ready. The problem was on the US side, specifically with USPS, which was not technically ready to accept parcels, declare them, and process the data under the new regulations. It was a glitch in America, not Estonia.\n\nEvery week we were on calls with Omniva, waiting for news. And only in early November, after almost two months, Omniva finally reopened shipping to the US for business clients. We can exhale, but the price has gone up by about 1.5 times. Now, at least, it is clear what prices to set on marketplaces to work in the black again.\n\nMy conclusions:\n\nOn one hand, this political decision almost closed my business. On the other hand, thanks to this, we found new solutions, rebuilt our logic, and realized that as a team, we are ready for any surprises. A legitimate bonus: during this time, I made a great contact at UPS. They offered conditions better than FedEx in terms of both price and speed. We are already at the final stage of signing the contract.\n\nAlso, to minimize losses, we worked according to a \"silent\" algorithm: If an order came from the US, we packed it and put it on hold for 10 days. If Omniva didn't solve the issue in 10 days, we sent it via FedEx. If they did we sent it through them. Since the client has a standard delivery time of about two weeks, everything arrived on time.\n\nThat is the story.",

      "selftext": "Continuing the story about my path to Decords brand. In my previous post, I ended with the thought that I started noticing that numismatics, my \"gold mine,\" was gradually drying up. While I was selling off the last coins, I began thinking what next? I wanted something of my own.\n\nIt started by accident. I had a blank wall in my kitchen and wanted to liven it up. I went on AliExpress and found some decorative stickers for €8. They arrived, I stuck them on everything looked neat. I went to work, came back in the evening and they were all lying on the floor. \"Okay,\" I thought, \"I probably bought the cheap stuff.\"\n\nI went back to AliExpress, found a similar design, but for €30. I applied them and waited. A week later, they started peeling off too. I started analyzing. Is it the wall? The paint? The concrete? I read forums and reviews and realized it was a common problem. Chinese vinyl often has weak adhesive. I found European materials have different glue, different structure.\n\nI looked further: to produce this, I needed equipment costing about €500 plus materials. By that time, thanks to the coins, I had the money. I ordered it. It arrived. I set it up and loaded the roll. I cut some test shapes circles, stars and stuck them on. They held.\n\nNext stage: Design. A couple of videos on YouTube, a few hours in Illustrator and I created a beautiful tree. I cut it on black vinyl and put it on my wall. It looked awesome. And most importantly, it stayed put! Then friends came over.\n\n\\- \"Listen, that’s beautiful. Where did you buy it?\"\n\n\\- \"Nowhere. I made it. The machine is in the corner.\"\n\n\\- \"Can you make one for me?\"\n\nI made one. They installed it, and they liked it. Then they wrote: \"My relatives liked it too, they want to order. How much?\" I sat down, calculated the material and time, and gave a price. They agreed. I made it, delivered it, and they ordered more. That’s when the picture started to form in my head: why not try selling this seriously?\n\nI placed an ad on a local site. At the same time, I started registering the company I already had the starting capital. And since I had experience with eBay, I immediately started looking toward marketplaces. I started diving deeper, figuring out the details, and listing products. Orders started coming in first one a day, then three. A couple of months later, I realized: I can't handle this at home anymore. I needed an office.\n\nI rented my first space. I remember it clearly, 20 square meters. Small, but mine. Then I hired my first employee. And gradually, a small idea born in a kitchen grew into a full-fledged business first decorative stickers, then printing production, professional printers, machines, and a team. And just like that, because of one cheap product from AliExpress that simply fell off the wall, a business was born one that I've been running for almost 10 years now.\n\nMy conclusions: First, if those stickers hadn't fallen off, maybe none of this would have started. That failure made me dig deeper, look for a better solution, and eventually find my path. And second quality always wins. People are willing to pay if the product is genuinely good. \n\nThat’s the story.",

You didn't start with a huge vision - you just solved your own problem, then realized others had it too. What I love about your story: you didn't quit at the first failed product. Most people would've just lived with a bare wall. You went deeper, figured out WHY it failed, found the solution, and that curiosity became your competitive advantage. The progression is textbook: solve your problem → friends notice → test pricing → validate demand → scale up. No massive investment, no complex business plan, just iterative steps. Quick question: when you made the jump from home to renting space, what was the monthly revenue that made you confident enough to take that leap? Always curious about that tipping point.",

Everyone knows he's a great artist, but nobody understands what makes him great it is not his paintings or sculptures. It is multidisciplanary mindset. He created infinite stuff from gadgets to fine art to papers, to business ideas. He had to learn all that by actually studying and experimenting. There were a lot of great fine artists, maybe even better than him at that time, but what made him an artist, is that he surpased them by knowing how to present himself, how to convince investors and the church and the government to give him land, how to manage resources, workers (who actually did all the work while he directed), and how to raise money. \n\nPeople just see the results and say, oh he's an artist cause he did this, without even analogizing the xyz factors that enabled him to do this. \n\nAn artist, or an entrepreneur is anyone who pushes the limits of what's possible in their domain. A banker can be an artist, a killer even can be an artist, no matter how unorthodox it sounds, or a tennis player, a developer, or an entrepreneur. Paradoxically self proclaimed artists are far from artists. they are more like hobyists, that have no need to exxplore the unknown, or try hard to change the status quo in their domain. (some) entrepreneurs do. These are for me the real entrepreneurs / artists that manage to actually do what they envision no matter the path.",

They were a distributor of stuff, I don’t remember what.  They wanted to figure out how to sell more into a customer they had.  I had worked at that customer, but that’s not why I got the interview.  I offered some suggestions on this issue.  Iirc, someone stopped and said something along the lines of “we’re not looking for change, we’re looking for someone to do what we say.”  \n\nI had worked on a project in school where I had to learn a bunch of new things.  I was so happy about that project because I could see benefits and I had learned so much new stuff.  I felt that learning new things and being open to different ideas was good.  I was in an interview where I said something about being forced to learn new things was important and a few other things.  Some crabby lady said some rude things about it and insinuated that none of that mattered because it couldn’t be applied to what they were looking for.  Honey, if you don’t want people who focus on learning new things to solve business problems, I’m not for you, and I wasn’t.  Never heard from them again.\n\nThis was over a number of years and it still took me longer to understand and grasp where I was being successful, wasn’t being successful, and who I could deal,with.

Who knows what, it was probably something totally insaine I wanted to do. \n\nI spend 2 days off from school trying to figure out how to make money until I found a bulk deal on those little snap rocks that come in the white paper people used to get on the 4th of July. I could buy them for 25cents as long as I spent $60 on them 😂 \n\nSo to me this was a no brainer. Except I had to \"borrow\" my mom's credit card. So I wrote out a plan on a piece of paper to figure out how many I needed to sell to pay her back before the next credit card bill. Calculated with shipping.\n\nObviously I got caught, the whole thing was a disaster. Turns out you can only sell so many of them until the same kids get board and the state decides you're selling fireworks.\n\nI managed to make back $50 in a little less than 2 weeks if memory serves me correct. \n\nMy dad yelled at me because he thought I wanted to play with the snap rocks and the money was secondary. But then I started yelling at him because as much as I wanted to play with them, to me they were valuable merchandise and a means to an end (I can't for the life of me remember what I was trying to get enough money to do just trust me, it was probably something I my parents would have been right to say no to)\n\nBut his accusation made me emotional because it underlined the pain of sacrificing for something that didn't work out and how unfair it was that I don't even get recognition for my discipline. When I was in middle school half of all I wanted was recognition and the other half was freedom. \n\nSo I'm in my room crying like a baby and my dad eventually is kinda like dude, the state dropped the charges (I shit you not), you're not kicked out of school, I didn't even ground you... What are you so upset about? (God bless my parents 😂) \n\nAnd I told him, I wanted to sell the stuff to get an Xbox (which was a lie but... Close enough) and he started telling me about all these businesses he tried starting with his friends. And all the issues they ran into between getting molds for products or certifications to make specific claims or having enough money for different rounds of testing and then trying to convince an investor to give him more money when they blew through it. By the end of that conversation. I realized this is what I was going to be good at one day. I loved learning about things, breaking them down to steps, business plans. The fact it's kinda like gambling but not really. I was a bit of a lonely kid so just the emotional stimulation alone had me hooked. \n\nI think being an entrepreneur is less of a skillset, not so much a state of mind, it's an alignment of interests with a compatible perspective.",

          "body": "I'm interested to hear everyone's reflections from childhood experiences where they found themselves entrepreneuring. Here's mine:\n\nIt took me until about 19 to call myself an entrepreneur (I didn't like the term before that for some reason), but then upon reflection I realized that I've been entrepreneuring my entire life instinctually.\n\nWhen I was 7 years old, all I wanted for Christmas/Chanukah (half-half family over here) was a cash register. Not sure if that's indicative of being an entrepreneur or because one half of my family celebrates Chanukah. That said, I ended up starting a \"video game business\" in my household where I took all my brother's xbox games, wrapped &amp; sorted them, then pretended to sell them to my parents.\n\nWhen I was 11 years old I was starting Minecraft servers and building out role structures, interviewing people to be moderators, setting up Discord channels, advertising the server on directories, working with players to improve their experience.\n\nAt 12, I started dog walking. About a year in, I hired all my friends to be dog walkers and turned it into a small business in our neighborhood where I got the new clients, earned a percentage of the walk, and managed the walking schedules.\n\nFrom 14-17, I worked at some companies doing customer service / other internships, and no matter what, I could not find myself being comfortable staying in one role for more than a couple months. I needed to create some kind of initiative at the company, move up, or learn something new.\n\nWhen I turned 18, I decided to start my own SEO consultancy and have since turned that into a creative + SEO agency (and I acquiesced to calling myself an entrepreneur).\n\nAll throughout those ages, I was creating new clubs at each school level (middle, high, college) and doing whatever I could to innovate what they offered. In high school, it was creating new arts organizations + initiatives; in college, it was creating the university's first true experiential arts event organization.\n\nNow I'm 22, graduated college with a degree in theatre/film and am running the agency - it would be impossible for me to live any other way.",

That said, here are the ones I either use or the ones I remember being mentioned here:\n\n* Windsurf Cascade AI Agent: We find Windsurf's AI agent to be much better than the more hyped tools like Claude Code or Cursor! We current use it with Sonnet 4.5 and it's been super impressive! It can basically make production changes to our web app from simple prompts, test changes, and improve automatically based on memory! \n* Perplexity: I think most people use ChatGPT and that is great. But for real time news and updates, Perplexity is great! You can basically setup a daily automation where it will pull relevant updates for you and auto send you a summary! \n* Sierra: Sierra is really good at auto resolving repetitive customer support tickets! It can learn from both past answers, your internal docs, faqs etc! We have gotten it to be able to resolve about 50% of all tickets instantly while rest are routed to real humans \n* Frizerly : Their AI agent that learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website to help you improve your Google ranking is pretty impressive! It can auto identify content gaps from competitors, improve based on results etc! Much better tool than Semrush etc imo! \n* Gamma: After every client meeting. I get an AI Zoom Summary, it is then automated through Gamma. Gamma generates the final PPT for myself and client on what we discuss in summary and the next steps. Clients love that. \n\nExcited to learn from others!",

It even caught a contradiction between the 'New MRI budget' and 'Union salary demands' that a standard prompt missed entirely.\n\nIt basically turns AI from a BS generator into a logic engine, but only if you force it to be a skeptic",

Twelve issues, 6 were good to merge, one was a spaghetti nightmare, 3 were inspirational, two were bad mainly because I tried something that was not in our context.\n\nWe're experimenting a lot, for example, as a founder, I have to be code-agnostic into my requests. Seriously fun to build, cost almost nothing because we use the free version of Linear. We had some good surprises.\n\nThe benefit is on both side: I can think of a task at midnight, use my iPhone to talk to Claude, that goes automatically to Linear. Then open Linear, assign it to Cursor, goes to sleep. On my tech co-founder side, his focus is on the hard parts, once he's ready, he checks the branches, decide whether he merges them or just add his part.\n\nWe may have saved for those 12 issues: 6h on my side, 8-9h on his.  \nHope it helps",

Every time I've seen people cheap out on their financial professionals, it ends up costing them more in the long run when they either don't get the expected service or become victims of fraud. \n\n\nMy advice is to find someone you want to work with and figure out how to make it work. Hire a bookkeeper to do the grunt work of transactional accounting so the CFO isn't stuck doing work worth $50/hr, instead they can focus on the higher value work that's actually worth the hourly rate.",

The scam is paying $200/hr for someone who's really just a bookkeeper with a fancy title.\n\nHere's how to separate the two:\n\nWhat you're actually looking for: Someone who can build a cash flow forecast, model out scenarios, help you understand when you'll need capital before you're desperate for it. That's FP&amp;A work. If they can't talk about 13-week cash flow models or explain what your runway looks like under different growth scenarios, they're not a CFO.\n\nRed flags:\n\n* They only talk about \"cleaning up your books\" (that's bookkeeping)\n* No process for regular forecasting or financial planning\n* Can't explain how they've helped similar-stage companies\n* Want a huge retainer upfront with vague deliverables\n\nWhere to actually find them:\n\n* LinkedIn, but search \"fractional CFO\" + your industry specifically\n* Ask other founders at your stage, warm intros beat cold outreach every time\n* Local accounting firms sometimes have CFO-level people doing advisory work\n* SCORE mentors can point you toward legit people in your market\n\nThe Upwork ghosting thing is real. Most good fractional CFOs aren't hunting for gigs on Upwork, they're getting referrals.\n\nWhat's \"starting to make actual money\" mean in numbers? Like $300K? $800K? $1.5M? The answer changes what level of CFO you actually need, and whether you need full FP&amp;A or just someone to build you a cash flow system you can run yourself.",

They see who actually delivers versus who just talks. Established fractional CFO firms also tend to be more reliable because they have process, oversight, and reputational risk. You pay more, but you’re buying reduced downside.\n\nOn pricing, $200 per hour isn’t a scam signal, it’s closer to market for someone who actually understands cash flow, forecasting, and decision support. The red flag is someone cheap who claims they can “do everything,” or someone who jumps straight into dashboards without first understanding how money actually moves through your business.\n\nBefore hiring, ask very specific questions: what metrics they focus on at your stage, how they’ve helped companies avoid cash crunches, and what decisions they’ve influenced, not just reports they’ve built. A short paid trial or project-based engagement is also reasonable before committing longer term.\n\nIf you’re early and mainly need cash clarity, sometimes a strong FP&amp;A consultant or experienced controller is a better first step than a full fractional CFO title.

Real recommendations beat cold hunting every time.\n\nAlso, don't sleep on LinkedIn search for fractional CFOs who've actually worked with startups at your stage. Look for people who post about cash flow, FP&amp;A, or fundraising. If their content makes sense and they're not spammy, shoot them a DM. The good ones are usually open to a quick call.\n\n$200/hr isn't wild if they actually know what they're doing and have startup experience, just make sure they can show you real examples of how they've helped companies like yours. If someone can't explain cash flow in plain English or dodges giving references, run.\n\nYou need someone who gets startups, not just big corp finance. Good luck once you find the right person, it's a total game changer for your sanity!",

          "body": "Most quality fractional CFOs do **not** operate on open freelance marketplaces. They usually come through **trusted referrals** from accountants, lawyers, investors, or other founders at a similar stage. Very low hourly rates are often a red flag; experienced CFOs typically charge a premium because they bring decision-level insight, not just bookkeeping.\n\nBefore hiring, it helps to be clear on what you actually need. Many early-stage companies don’t need a full CFO yet sometimes a strong controller or FP&amp;A consultant is a better, lower-risk fit. When you do speak to candidates, focus on real outcomes: how they’ve improved cash flow, supported fundraising, or built reporting systems, and always check references.\n\nIn short, avoid shortcuts, pay for experience, and hire through networks you already trust.",

Depending on your business this can be easy or tough. Then do the same for your receivables (again when due not invoiced). You now have the bare bones of a cash flow forecast if you join these together. The first thing I spot every time I do this is the payables being paid early because the terms aren't entered right.\n\nGood luck!",

Just share tools or services you personally use or genuinely like. A lot of people on TikTok and YouTube are earning steady income this way, and once you understand how to place your links, it’s one of the lowest-effort income streams out there.\n\n2. Consulting.\nMost folks don’t realize how much their experience is actually worth. If you’ve spent years in any field : business, tech, creative work, ministry, fitness, whatever someone else is trying to learn what you already know. Offering simple consulting sessions can bring in quick income with very little setup.\n\n3. Digital courses.\nIf you can teach something step-by-step, you can create a small course. It doesn’t need to be complicated or long; it just needs to help someone solve a problem or get a result. Once it’s made, it can continue to generate revenue without you constantly working on it.\n\nAll three are beginner-friendly, affordable to start, and can be launched in a few weeks or less.",

Skills you might not see or value yet.\n* Starting a company means you'll deal with even more ambiguity and contradictions, except now it's all on you with no paycheck safety net.\n* \"I can't nail a good idea\" is a huge red flag.

Test if you actually enjoy the entrepreneurial grind or just hate bad bosses.\n* If you're constantly frustrated, maybe the issue isn't the execs but the type of companies you're joining. Try a different stage or culture.\n* Work on finding a problem you care about deeply. Ideas come from obsession, not brainstorming sessions.\n\nEntrepreneurship won't fix frustration with authority, it'll just give you new, harder problems.

Combining personal and business in one system can actually create more headaches than it solves, especially come tax time or if you ever need to show financials to anyone (bank, investor, partner).\n\nThe messiness you're feeling with separate apps usually comes from not having a clear workflow, not from having multiple tools. A dedicated business account (even just a separate checking account) plus something like Wave or a basic QBO subscription keeps things clean without overthinking it.\n\nIf you're dead set on combining, Quicken B&amp;P handles the basics okay. The tagging system works well enough for categorizing business vs personal. But the reporting is meh for anything beyond simple expense tracking, and bank sync has been flaky for me with certain institutions.\n\nWhat kind of business are you running?

          "body": "I’ve gone down this exact rabbit hole before. Quicken Business &amp; Personal is legitimate for solo operators who want clarity without needing to go full accountant mode. It does a decent job of letting you see personal and business money in one place, which is honestly the biggest win early on. Expense tracking, income, and basic reporting all feel approachable, not overwhelming like some accounting tools can be. The tradeoff is that it has a lot of features, so there is a small learning curve at first. Once it’s set up, though, it usually simplifies things rather than adding noise. If you are trying to clean things up without hiring a bookkeeper or living in spreadsheets, it is worth a trial run.",

      "selftext": "I’ve failed five times trying to build a business. Not “almost worked” failures. Real ones.  \nThe kind where you spend months building, launching, and nothing happens, not even a single customer.\n\nOne thought kept coming back: **I didn’t fail because I was careless. I failed because I focused on the wrong certainty.**\n\nI’m a backend engineer with 10+ years of experience. So naturally, whenever I started something new, I focused on the technical part. Architecture. Clean systems. Edge cases.  \nIt felt productive, it felt safe, and that’s exactly why it became a problem.\n\nAcross those five attempts, the assumptions that hurt me the most were never technical. They were the ones I kept postponing because they were uncomfortable and unclear.\n\nThings like:\n\n* Will anyone actually care enough to pay for this?\n* Do people know this problem exists?\n* Am I building something people are already looking for?\n\nEach time, I told myself I’d test those later. After the product was “good enough”, after I felt confident, but later never really came.\n\nSo the hardest lesson for me wasn’t “build faster” or “market better”. It was this:\n\n**If you delay testing the riskiest assumptions, you’re not reducing risk. You’re just hiding from it.**\n\nWhat surprised me most is how easy it is to hide not from others, but from myself.  \nAs an experienced developer, the technical work felt safe and familiar. It gave me certainty, just not the kind a business needs.\n\nI’m still building. Just differently now. Curious: when something you built failed or succeeded, which assumption hurt the most when it turned out to be wrong demand, distribution, technical or something else?",

Accountability groups, founder dinners, even online communities where you can vent and celebrate wins with people who actually get it.\n* Don't wait for a partner to feel supported. Build your own support system: mentors, friends who check in, therapist if needed. These relationships can fill the gap in different ways.\n* Celebrate your own wins, even the tiny ones. Being self-reliant is a huge strength, and you're building something meaningful on your own terms.\n* The right partner will show up when you're already thriving, not to fix the loneliness but to add to what you've built.\n\nYou're not alone in feeling this way. A ton of solo founders wish they had someone in their corner, but they keep going anyway. You're doing something most people are too scared to even start. That takes serious courage. Keep pushing, the right support will come.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I want to share my story.\n\nI’m a freelancer working mainly in motion graphics. I move from contract to contract, making videos for different companies. Since the pandemic, getting work at design agencies has become harder for me because they want extremely high-level experts. I’m good at what I do, but I’m not the best, so I focus more on working with local businesses in my city and trying to slowly scale my business.\n\nThis season was both the best and the worst. I had a lot of work, so I hired another freelancer to help me. The problem was that she kept making excuses for late deliveries. For the video editing work I hired her for, she ended up doing almost nothing, and what she did deliver was poorly done.\n\nI tried to help her by creating SOPs and putting in a lot of effort to make things work, but it didn’t. In the end, I had to redo everything myself for a client who was already upset, and I ended up losing that client. Because of all that rework, I fell behind with other clients, which caused some of them to hold my payments.\n\nRight now, I don’t have money. I let the freelancer go, but I couldn’t cover her last invoice, and now she’s threatening to sue me.\n\nI’m really sad. I know I’m not a big company, but things got out of hand, and I feel cornered from all sides.\n\nHas anyone else been through something like this?",

You could sue her for losing customers. On the other hand you should have made the decision to terminate the contract and look for someone else. Maybe the best outcome here is both cutting your losses and part. Suing is very costly and both could end up worse.\n\nConsult a lawyer; maybe the first half an hour is free.

And it makes me wonder if I should give it up and stop trying to be an entrepreneur and give 100% to the day job and spend any extra energy I have on hobbies or something.

I never started my own ISP but I spent over a decade working at small independent ones around the Midwest and really understanding computer networking, tech support and all kinds of Telecom, jargon and work. I was able to make a decent living with that and build a lot of skills and networks both technical and social. \n\nI lived at home till I was 25. Then I rented a place for 2 years. Then I bought my own duplex where I live in one unit and I rent the other one out. I had that paid off in about 5 years with a 15-year mortgage rents. Just went up enough and I knew I'd always want to have a roof over my head. \n\nI worked on my tech consulting business. I kind of had a really minimal one for years. You can say I technically started when I was in high school cuz I started making money then but it was really sporadic. Maybe work every month or every other super tighty. I just kind of kept it small and sporadic but it grew organically over time but I didn't put a lot of money into this. I just would have stuff get reinvested I would buy like a tool kit from money that I had business cards, a domain name, a basic one-page website and then over time I got a larger ecommerce website but really the ecom website and the LLC and a lot of the bigger stuff. Even getting business insurance was post covid and a lot of that happened in 2022 and 2023. It was a long slow bird and I ended up refining into senior citizen tech support both in person and remote as well as senior centers and teaching classes. There teaching classes at the community college that I went to. I teach continuing Ed classes there now on computers and technology. So I just kept growing and going but this was always a side hustle. I had ideas on what I wanted to do when I was younger and luckily they were built on a sound foundation and I was able to explore them grow and turn dreams into reality. Hopefully you'll be able to do that too. I still have a day job but my plan is to have a fully self-supporting self-employed tech Business and the rental income and then I should be set financially. Hopefully the above kind of answers your question. It was more just me reflecting on my experience but",

So you can use those lessons to your advantage. \n\nIf you haven't realized it by now, you've validated for yourself that following the Internet hype when it comes to which businesses to do or start simply doesn't work. That's not something you were going to learn any other way other than by trying those businesses and failing at them. Which you did.\n\nWhat you need at this point is find ways to experiment with more radical ideas but in a very low-cost way. You say that you're currently building software that can help your business and others...that's excellent! Get that one or two businesses that will use it and let them help you improve on it with their feedback. You need to achieve something that Eric Ries calls validated learning in his book, The Lean Startup. What that is simply is crucial info that helps you understand your customer needs better and improve the product or pivot the business.\n\nWith this approach, you won't just be trying out different businesses hoping something works out. Instead, you will be building something that eventually helps someone or a business and that way you can create a sustainable revenue source and overall an entrepreneurial journey worth journeying long-term.\n\nIf your time allows, I suggest you read that book by Eric Ries (The Lean Startup) and supplement it with The New Business Road Test by John Mullins. Same way heroes in films can inspire action so can reading about successful entrepreneurs who lay it all about their beginnings and how they built their business.",

I pushed myself so far that I ended up sitting in front of a psychologist, lost, burned out, depressed and stressed.\n\nEventually, I gave myself a break and got a normal job. Just for some time, I told myself, to breathe a little, maybe plan my next big idea, recharge and collect some energy.\n\nIt’s been two years since that decision and holy shit, am I happy.\n\nI deleted all that fake influencer social media crap and actually started living.

You can still make great money with a normal job, have free time and travel the world, especially now, with remote work becoming more and more common.\n\nSo my advice is simple, take a break. Breathe. Spend time with people you love. Find a hobby or two. Chill the fuck out.\n\nYou have time.\n\nAnd if later you decide you want to start a business, do it then. Plenty of people started at 50, 60 or even later.\n\nMost importantly, sit down and ask yourself why you even want to be an entrepreneur. You’ll get more answers than you can imagine, and a much clearer path forward.\n\nWishing you all the best and peaceful holidays, brother ❤️",

Look at your own progression: dropshipping, pressure washing, software that solves real problems. That's not random thrashing, that's figuring shit out.\n\nThe issue isn't that you can't get things right. It's that you're building things that solve problems people have, just not problems they'll pay to solve. That's actually the last filter before product-market fit.\n\nHere's what I'd do if I were you, this is from experience:\n\nStop trying to \"come up with ideas\" for a month. relax that mental muscle. Instead, just notice what pisses you off at your day job. What manual task do you constantly do that feels stupid? What problems keeps happening? What report takes 2 hours that should take 5 minutes?\n\nBuild tools for yourself first. Use them for a few weeks. If they actually save you time, show your coworkers. If they start asking for it, you might have something.\n\nThe best businesses come from scratching your own itch, not scanning the market for opportunities (again experience). You've already proven you can build and learn - you just need to solve a problem you personally feel every week.\n\n Taking a break to recharge isn't quitting. It's smart. You can give 100% to your day job and keep your eyes open for real problems without forcing yourself to grind on side projects out of obligation. Sometimes the best ideas show up when you stop looking so hard. \n\n The universe tends to push away the things we feel we desperatly desire. Relationships, money, opportunities and the more we stress over them the furthur away they get creating a cycle. You can get off the track at anytime. Take a breth and regroup. What worked, what have I learned?  Even if its what NOT to do.  Everything is a step forward ESPECIALLY failure.  There is not 1 person who tried something for the first time and succeeded.  Every successful personhad to deal with failure of somekind.  The difference between the successful and the \"failure\" is the failure fails to push on.\n\n I'm working on it and with AI, anything is possible at the moment. Rest, regroup and move forward my entrepreneurial brother",

          "body": "Late 20s is honestly very early to be drawing conclusions about calling it quits, even though it doesn’t feel like it when you’re tired and fed up. What you’re describing doesn’t sound like someone who’s failed repeatedly, it sounds like someone who’s been searching without a stable base underneath them yet.\n\nOne thing I’d gently challenge is the idea that every attempt has to be the thing. Most people who eventually make it didn’t bounce from idea to idea until one magically worked, they anchored themselves in something boring and reliable first. A job, a trade, a skill, an industry. Then they built from inside that, not from the outside looking in. Random businesses are hard because you’re fighting on every front at once.\n\nThe pressure washer example is a good one. It didn’t fail because pressure washing is a bad business, it failed because you had no leverage yet: no experience, no reputation, no repeat customers, no pricing confidence. That’s not a character flaw, that’s just physics. The same applies to software. Solving a problem people won’t pay for usually means the problem is real, but the buyer, urgency, or positioning is wrong, not that you’re incapable.\n\nAlso, exhaustion is a signal, not a verdict. When you’re burnt out, your brain tells you stories like “I’m running out of time” and “I’m wired wrong”. Neither of those are facts. They’re what happens when effort hasn’t compounded yet. Compounding always looks stupid and pointless right up until it suddenly doesn’t.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with going all-in on a day job for a while if it buys you energy, skills, and financial breathing room. That isn’t quitting entrepreneurship, it’s regrouping. Some of the most dangerous advice out there is never give up without acknowledging that timing, positioning, and season of life matter.\n\nIf you are wired differently, that doesn’t mean you’re broken. It usually means you’re better suited to building something slowly, from depth, not chasing opportunities from the surface. Find one domain, one skill, one problem space you can sit in long enough to actually understand. Let boredom work in your favour.\n\nYou don’t need a big idea right now. You need rest, stability, and one small win that proves to you that effort can turn into results. From there, ideas show up on their own.",

Do you even know anyone that is an inventor that lives off the money they make from inventing shit?Have you ever met anyone?\n\nOkay, so let's focus on things that already exist.You don't have to come up with a unicorn idea.You have to find value to bring to the marketplace.\n\nI own a company in commercial truck parts manufacturing and sales. I found a niche of parts, and sub divided it into a sub niche of 7 items with 28 configurations. I don't know shit about trucks or truck parts or any of that stuff, but I know all the stuff that you don't know. I just like that stuff, and I like business. You could say that i'm really good at it.\n\n The truck parts just happen to be the industry I worked in at the time. I find that if you seek your niche in the industry that you're currently working in, you have a higher possibility of finding it within months to a couple years of searching and researching. When you work at a job, you have insight to the industry and the behind the scenes stuff that the average person just doesn't whether it be in a restaurant or a law firm or a construction company. When I researched my part, I called the name on the bag. I also found out there was one other manufacturer. They are both made in america.... For every truck on the planet. They were the only two manufacturers. I worked at a diesel shop. So when I called them asking about pricing, they asked, how much a month we use, and eventually push me to a distributor. That actually gave me a list of all their distributors. I then called those distributors and got pricing. A week later, I called back the manufacturers to set up the diesel shop as a distributor. This gave us their distributor costs. So now I knew what wholesale and retail prices were. I understood.The volumes required to be a distributor from the manufacturers. And I had an idea of how many parts were sold per year.Based on all of that information. I was also able to get the purchasing people at a couple other parts distributors to call\nand go through the same process to verify my information.\n\nI double checked the manufacturing to make sure they were not importing them. Import Yeti is free to use.\n\nI have google so I could do some basic searches to figure out how many commercial trucks are on the road. I worked in a commercial truck repair shop that did the repairs that utilized these parts so I was able to find out how often trucks have to have these repairs made. I was able to find out that this part has not changed in design since trucks were invented. I also found out that the seven that I chose out of hundreds were the universal components that fit a majority of the trucks. They're also required. Their non safety facing, so I don't have to worry about anyone dying. I sent some of them off to a lab to have mass spectrometer materials composition testing and made prints of each. \n\nI utilized import yeti to identify factory clusters in China, India, and Mexico that manufacturer's similar items.\n\nSteel, Zinc parts with strict tolerances, stamped, machined, cast, and plated.\n\nAfter researching factories, I understood what I was looking for in my own factories.\n\nMaterials, processes, in-house tooling and die making, QC testing capabilities, certifications, 3d printing, and packaging/labeling in-house.\n\nI found three factories in china that I reached out to via email. I also found a factory in taiwan that I used for my initial orders. Over the years, i've expanded to 9 countries now including the USA.\n\nI stored everything underneath my camper in a crate pallet or tupperware, totes with a blue tarp over it. Eventually I got a small self storage unit next to the rv park lived in. Eventually, we bought a home and used the two car garage as our primary warehouse with overflow, going into multiple self storage units locally. I picked packed and shipped everything until year five (2021). Then, I moved ninety percent of everything into a 3pl partner because I don't want to run a daycare and have employees.  \n\nI didn't do any advertising or marketing or online stuff at all.And I still don't. I cold called every single commercial truck repair shop dealership college o e.M in america and a double digit percentage globally, solo over the last 9 (10 years in a couple months).\n\nThe hardest part about my business is not sales or any of that other stuff. It's managing inventory to keep up with sales volumes and cash flow.Because all manufacturing turnaround is about ninety days. If you grow at five hundred percent, you're gonna have to buy fifteen hundred percent worth of inventory.Because the timeline drag, and that's a lot of capital to have to manage and flip with a growing business. You can't have back orders or someone will just go to your competitors that you had to take them away from.",

I’ve accepted that maybe the timing wasn’t right, but ever since then I’ve been stuck.\n\nI have clients and ongoing work, yet I keep delaying everything. I procrastinate constantly, wake up late, smoke up, and can’t focus at all. What scares me is that my bank balance isn’t growing, but instead of panicking and working harder like I used to, I feel oddly numb.\n\nI know I’m operating way below my potential, and that makes me really sad. I feel lazy and just disconnected from my drive. Getting out of bed seems like a task. 15mins work is taking me 3-4 days of procrastination or even more sometimes. So many clients i worked with haven’t paid me for the work because it took me 3 months to send an invoice. I look at girls on instagram and think why isn’t my life as easy as theirs? why do i need to grind so much, i’m tired of being a boss lady. I used to feel incredible when younger girls looked up to me, but now i don’t know. I feel shit. I think marrying a decent guy is an easier option for the time. Sick mentality innit? But thats where the burnout has led me. \n\nHas anyone experienced this after setback or a business failure?\nWhat actually helped you get back into momentum?",

          "body": "Yes. This is very common after a setback. You’re not broken and you’re not lazy.\n\nWhat you’re describing sounds like burnout mixed with grief. Not grief for a person, but for a version of yourself and a future you thought you were building. When the office didn’t work out, something inside you took a hit, even if your brain says “it’s fine, timing was wrong.” Your body didn’t move on at the same speed.\n\nA lot of high performers don’t realize this, but drive doesn’t disappear because you’re weak. It disappears because your nervous system is tired of being in fight mode. So instead of panic, you feel numb. Instead of motivation, you avoid. That’s not a character flaw. That’s your system hitting the brakes.\n\nThe Instagram comparison is also a big clue. When you’re tired and disappointed, your brain starts looking for exits. “Maybe life should be easier. Maybe I don’t want this anymore.” That doesn’t mean you actually want to quit. It means you’re exhausted from carrying the identity of “boss lady” without rest or reward.\n\nA few practical things that actually help people get momentum back.\n\nFirst, stop trying to become your old self again. That person was running on adrenaline and excitement. You don’t rebuild momentum by forcing that. You rebuild it by shrinking the game.\n\nRight now, your only real job is to stabilize. Not grow. Not grind. Stabilize.\n\nSend invoices. That’s it. Not perfect invoices. Not all of them. One or two a day. Money coming in reduces numbness faster than motivation does.\n\nSecond, lower the bar so much it feels almost stupid. Fifteen minutes of work is too big right now. Do five. Set a timer. When it ends, you’re allowed to stop. Momentum comes from finishing, not from effort.\n\nThird, separate “I don’t want to work” from “I don’t want this life.” Burnout lies to you and tells you they’re the same thing. They’re not. You can be tired of how you’re working without being wrong for wanting independence or ambition.\n\nFourth, the smoking and late waking aren’t the cause. They’re coping. If you shame yourself for them, you’ll stay stuck longer. Fixing structure comes after energy comes back, not before.\n\nAnd lastly, about the marriage thought. That’s not a sick mentality. It’s a tired one. When people are overwhelmed, they fantasize about safety. That doesn’t mean you should act on it. It just means you need rest and support, not another identity to perform.\n\nMany people who’ve built things hit this exact wall in their mid 20s. Especially women carrying both ambition and expectations. The ones who recover don’t “push through.” They slow down, clean up basics, and let confidence rebuild quietly.\n\nYou don’t need to become a different person. You need to heal the part of you that feels like it failed.",

You could see someone on IG taking a photo in a luxurious hotel, but you are not seeing what she did to achieve it, for example, working 9 months to achieve that.

Reddit can be good, but if you can invest a couple hundred into coaching/mentorship of some sort you can usually see a huge ROI.\n\nFor me as someone who works in this space it seems like this \"setback\" (more like a lesson) has either caused some sort of mental limitation you are perceiving and you might be dealing with some sort of imposter syndrome or limiting beliefs which are holding you back.\n\nYou need to stop getting your motivation extrinsically and instead wake up and do things which energize you and things you enjoy that keep you creative while making your work more enjoyable. If you focus on doing these you'll almost certainly stop the procrastination and panic mode because you'll be focused on creating and it'll be your pride and pleasure. Of course this is just a judgement with the very limited info we have here, it could also be something completely different.\n\nAgain, its best to speak to someone who has actually dealt with this stuff before, i don't mind listening to you more and giving you a better judgement, either ways please take care of yourself first, i know its not easy, but this too will pass, don't worry :)",

The procrastination made everything pile up, which made it even more overwhelming.\n\nWhat I learned is that when you're in that state, even small admin tasks feel impossibly heavy. The thought of opening my CRM or sending an invoice would make me want to hide. But then the guilt from not doing it made everything worse.\n\nThe turning point for me was when I realized I didn't have to do everything myself, especially not the boring stuff that was contributing to my burnout. I got an AI assistant that could handle the invoicing, follow-ups, scheduling - basically all the tasks I was avoiding.\n\nSuddenly I wasn't drowning in admin work anymore, and I could focus on the parts of my business that actually excited me again. The creative stuff, the client work, the strategy - not the endless paperwork.\n\nIt sounds like you're dealing with the same thing where simple tasks feel massive. Have you considered automating some of the admin work that's piling up? Sometimes just clearing that backlog can give you space to rediscover why you loved your business in the first place.\n\nThe drive comes back, but sometimes you need to remove the obstacles first.

This happens frequently for entrepreneurs and small business owners. Add being an ambitious person, the impatience that usually comes with being in your 20s, and the comparison trap of social media, and it’s a recipe for judging, berating yourself and feeling like you can’t figure it out. The down side of social media is that it’s based on selective sharing, so we don’t see the full spectrum of life experiences and challenges in people’s lives.\n\nAcalem gave some really good advice in his post with regard to breaking tasks and timing down to even smaller chunks. \n\nI think one of the other pieces that I’m sensing is that enough people don’t talk openly about how hard it is to build a business regardless of one’s success level. It takes a lot of work especially if you’re doing it alone or don’t have a community of people who can really empathize with you and get it. Everyday you’re waking up to bring some meaningful contribution to clients, to your community, or to the world, and that requires A LOT from a human being mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually, financially, relationally. \n\nBecause it takes your energy, it also requires lots of rest, recovery, resetting, etc. As a former collegiate athlete, I tell my clients all that time that as a leader or business owner, you have to think about yourself as an elite / Olympic athlete. These athletes are not practicing at 100% everyday. They have higher capacity days and lower capacity days. They also have rest and recovery days built into their programs. They’ve created success structures for themselves so that they can perform optimally and sustainably.\n\nSo as a business owner yourself, aka an elite athlete, I’d encourage you to practice extending some space and grace for yourself so that you can recognize that, maybe at the particular moment in time, you need some time for rest and recovery.\n\nWith regard to picking yourself back up after the setback, take some time to write down what didn’t work and why (if you haven’t already). \n\nWere you trying to do it all yourself? Did you not have the infrastructure in place? Was the space not right for you / too expensive? If you had a team, would it have made a difference? \n\nAs for the grief / burnout recovery, there are lots of good resources for this. Have you done any kind of exploratory / “excavation” work around naming and being with any hard / harsh feelings connected to disappointment? Do you have friends, a therapist, and/or a coach that you could work with to help you move through that type of work?\n\nLast thing, do you ever give yourself time / space / permission to just do nothing so that your mind can unwind and settle? The image of a snow globe comes to mind. When we are full or flooded, it’s like the snow globe that we shake up and watch all the snow flurries settle back down. If we don’t make space for doing nothing, then our brains, bodies, and systems can’t settle and we stay in hyper alert / overdrive. \n\nI hope this helps, and gives you some additional things to think about.",

Getting the first couple clients wasn't easy, but I'm getting more and more, and I'm hoping it ramps up even more the start of next year.

I'm 34, married, and have a 3-year old. I don't particularly like my current job, it's okay, but there are times when I absolutely loath it. I just want to be a good role model for my son, show him what hard work can achieve, and do my best to provide as much as I can for my family. I've heard that you'll never be wealthy being an employee, and owning a business is where you can really make the big bucks. But I know that most businesses fail, I know it's absolutely not a guarantee. Trust me, I don't have high expectations, I don't think I'll be a millionaire in the next year or two.

You're trading time for money. To get to $20K/month you'd need to either charge way more (hard market for that) or work way more hours (defeats the point of leaving your job).\n\nThe \"you'll never be wealthy as an employee\" thing is mostly BS. Plenty of people get rich with W2 jobs, especially in tech. Most small businesses don't make their owners rich either. Media companies especially are brutal margins.\n\nKeep doing it as a side hustle. If you can get to $10K/month consistently while keeping your day job, then maybe consider it. But jumping now with $3K/month and a family depending on you is risky for not much upside.\n\nBeing a good role model for your kid isn't about owning a business.

Most people quit too early and the pressure kills their business. My approach would be: keep the job until you hit $8-10k/month consistently for 6 months. That proves the business can scale without the desperation of needing it to work. Right now you have leverage: you can say no to bad clients, you can invest profits back into equipment/marketing, and you can sleep at night. That's huge. At 34 with a family, the smart play isn't \"all in\" - it's strategic transition. Get to $10k/month, build systems, maybe hire a part-time editor to free up your time, THEN consider the jump. You'll never regret having a safety net. You will regret jumping too early and running out of runway. What's your plan to get from $3k to $10k without quitting?",

If you can save up at least 6 months to a year of expenses to cover the bills and things and a buffer so you aren't stressed about handling your immediate expenses and can grow your business to the point you're bringing in money comfortably. \n\nI'll just say I know you might have brought 3k in gross revenue but have you worked out your numbers? Do you know your costs, things like taxes, general liability insurance, cameras, digital storage costs, any editing software subscriptions, car maintenance, etc worked out and have income being split up to cover that stuff  before you taking a paycheck. Obviously you want to enjoy your money but if the joker ain't going against the IRS, you sure as heck don't want to either. \n\nI'll say I'm a mobile mechanic, I lost my job in February and started this business in late spring early summer because I couldn't get a job. It was sink or swim. Now thankfully my wife has a job that was able to cover the bills and things and I'm just getting the point where I'm making regularish income but it's tough and I'm still getting my business straight and in better shape. I'm doing a lot of social media advertising and what not. And it's so much more stressful to be busting your ass making basically nothing and your family asking \"when are you going to get a real job\".

A simple way to determine which task creates forward momentum is to focus on the \"active\" vs \"inactive\" distinction.\n\nBy selecting only one key priority each day, you will be able to let the rest of the priorities rest until the next day. If you ignore low-priority tasks, you will be able to continue your project with higher energy. Ignoring low-impact tasks is a method of building, not a sign of failure.",

Or more accurately, the one logo you liked best out of the many many many logos you can have it make you to choose from. Or the AI logo you then tweaked a little.

It being made by a human does not effect that.\n\nHere is your genuine question.  \nShow me an unbiased study comparing AI to human logo and how they performed differently all things otherwise created equally.

I often get sent off-kilter pictures of a printout, or a blurry low res version, or anything but the original file. \n\nI hired a designer (semi-local to me) to make my logo, and they nailed it. It cost me a whole $150. Good investment as far as I’m concerned. I know expenses are tight when you’re starting out but considering the impact a good logo makes, that’s a pretty small investment.

      "selftext": "This is the pattern. I’ve now seen it happen to enough businesses that it’s impossible to ignore.\n\n1 . Stripe makes onboarding laughably easy. Instant approval. Start processing today. No real checks.\n\n2. Shortly after, they say funds must be held “for security reasons” while you continue operating normally.\n\n3. You are encouraged to keep selling. Your balance grows. Stripe is happy to let it pile up.\n\n4. The moment funds are due for release, surprise. They suddenly need “additional documentation.”\n\n5. You submit everything requested. IDs, business records, invoices, proof of delivery, everything.\n\n6. After that, Stripe decides they “can no longer service your account” due to vague fraud concerns.\n\n7. They freeze the entire balance indefinitely “in case of chargebacks” and keep the money.\n\n8. Stripe claims they will refund customers. In reality, refunds often never happen.\n\n9. To protect your reputation, you are forced to tell customers to file chargebacks themselves.\n\n10. Stripe then points to those chargebacks as proof that they were right all along.\n\nFull circle. Self-fulfilling justification.\n\nThe reality is this. The account was fine. The transactions were real. The only thing Stripe did consistently was hold customer money while earning interest and shifting all risk onto the merchant.\n\nIf Stripe truly believed the activity was fraudulent, refunds would be issued immediately. Instead, funds sit. Customers wait. Businesses get destroyed.\n\nMore and more investigators are starting to recognize this pattern for what it is. This isn’t “risk management.” It’s systematic fund retention disguised as compliance.\n\nThis will come back around. And when it does, Stripe won’t be able to hide behind boilerplate emails and trust-and-safety buzzwords anymore.\n\nIf you’ve experienced this, speak up. Silence is exactly what lets this continue.",

          "body": "This pattern is real, but I think it’s less a secret “fraud playbook” and more a structural failure that hits small operators disproportionately.\n\nStripe isn’t actually deciding whether you’re honest or not. Their risk systems are deciding whether your business is *legible under stress*. When something trips a flag, the question isn’t “were these transactions real?” It’s “can this merchant produce a clean, auditable narrative fast enough that our internal confidence threshold clears?” Most can’t — not because they’re doing anything wrong, but because their ops live across inboxes, spreadsheets, Stripe metadata, and half-documented workflows.\n\nAt that point, the default outcome is account offboarding. Holding funds isn’t malicious so much as the path of least internal risk. It looks predatory from the outside because the merchant has zero leverage and no way to reduce uncertainty once the decision process starts.\n\nThis also isn’t unique to Stripe. PayPal, Square, Shopify Payments all behave similarly once volume or velocity crosses a line. The common failure mode is the same: founders are running real businesses, but their operational proof is fragmented.\n\nThis is one of the reasons we’re building Quorum (still in beta): not as a payments alternative and definitely not a magic fix for Stripe, but as infrastructure so businesses aren’t scrambling when a platform suddenly asks them to “prove legitimacy.” Centralized customers, jobs, invoices, inventory, fulfillment — basically making your operation readable instead of reconstructing it under pressure.\n\nIt doesn’t solve the power imbalance, but it can shrink the blast radius.  \nFor anyone curious: [https://usequorum.app](https://usequorum.app)",

      "selftext": "Hello, the title hopefully clearly describes my situation. I purchased a business 5 months ago and have been discovering that there are customer accounts that show a total of nearly $150k in credit. \n\nCustomers paid a deposit toward the purchase of items that needed to be ordered prior to my ownership of the business, and I have been completing the sale of these items since then using the \"credit\" that they have on their accounts. There was no bank account included in the sale of this business, so there is essentially no money supporting the sales that are made with credit.\n\nIf this isn't making sense, I'll add some numbers and dates. \nLet's say that a customer wanted to purchase an item with MSRP of $10k on August 1st. The item wasn't in stock and had to be ordered, so the customer paid a $5k deposit on August 1st, the credit is added to their customer account and the item was ordered. I purchased the business on September 1st, previous owner said there was no business bank account (which seemed likely enough). On September 15th, the item arrives, customer is notified and comes in pays the remaining $5k of the $10k and takes the item. So essentially I only actually get $5k from this sale. The kicker is that I get a bill for the item on October 1 for $6k (the cost of the item), so now I actually lost $1k from the sale. This scenario happens dozens of times in slightly different variations.\n\nThe point of sale software shows $0 on August 1st and $10k on September 15th (even though the money actually hit the bank on the 1st) so I assumed it was all good on the 15th.\n\nMany items were ordered and sold, and it has taken me a long time to understand what has occurred. \n\nWhat do I do now? How do I recover the money?\n\nOne more thing, I'm paying for the purchase.of the business over time, the seller essentially financed that sale, so I figure I should be able to subtract the $150k from what I still.owe on the purchase... Right?\n\nEDIT: **The other part of this is that I worked for the business as an employee before I purchased it from the owner, so I saw that we were successful and knew that it was making good money, though I had no way of seeing the true financials in my role.",

Everyone talking about suing your attorney or accountant are not terribly experienced with this stuff.  Most attorneys and accountants don't know this stuff, or how to uncover it.  And if you go to court nobody wins.\n\nReport back and let me know how the discussion goes.",

Still, sloppy accounting (and shady on their part). \n\nThere’s a chance he was out of cash and wouldn’t be able to fulfill the orders and was using you as a capital injection. As long as the business is profitable and you can deduct the extra amount you’re putting in from what you owe, you can navigate out of the situation if you have enough capital. Should definitely have a conversation with him and get everyone on the same page. If he has capital left he should be handling fulfillment of those preorders.",

The business owed customers either product or a refund. When you bought the business without the cash that came with those deposits, you inherited the obligation but not the money that funded it.\n\nSo in your example:\n\nCustomer pays $5k deposit before you own the business\n\nThat $5k should have been sitting in cash, offset by a customer credit liability\n\nYou didn’t receive that cash at purchase\n\nWhen you complete the sale, you collect the remaining $5k, but you still pay the full $6k vendor bill\n\n\nThat’s why it feels like you “lost” money on each sale. Economically, the loss already existed at purchase — it just shows up over time as you fulfill those orders.\n\nA few important points:\n\n1. You generally can’t recover this from customers. They already paid what they owed.\n\n\n2. This is something to raise with the seller, because those customer credits should have been addressed in the purchase price or paid out at closing. It’s very common for this to be handled as a purchase price adjustment.\n\n\n3. No, you shouldn’t unilaterally subtract $150k from what you owe without talking to a lawyer or CPA, but yes — conceptually, this is exactly the kind of issue that gets netted against seller financing if the contract allows it.\n\n\n4. Going forward, you should track customer deposits explicitly as a liability so this stops being invisible.\n\n\n\nYou didn’t suddenly discover that the business “wasn’t profitable.” You discovered that part of the balance sheet didn’t come with the sale. That’s a painful realization, but it’s also a solvable one once it’s clearly identified.",

It’s a hard and stressful and lonely job and that life isn’t meant for everyone. And that’s okay!\n\nSo to me your options are: \n\n* Sell it. Sell the business to someone who *is* crazy about weddings and desperately wants to own a venue and will have a vision for it, get a job that doesn’t make you miserable and give yourself some peace of mind back. It is fine!\n* Focus on becoming a true business owner. Get an education. Be passionate about weddings and/or events and stay on top of trends. Quit all side projects and focus all your time and energy on your business. Educate yourself on the basics. Read! \n\nHonestly, and I say this in kindness, it doesn’t sound like number two is what you really want to do, so just know it’s fine to choose option one.",

The wedding industry is built on customer service relationships. Reach out to the ones you liked working with the most in the last 2 years.

So make sure your venue is on their most - requested list.\nIf you dont have that start here....\n\n-Does your space need updates?  (Lighting, ease of use, parking , electrical , LANDSCAPING - genz brides want lots of places to take pictures. Make sure no area looks old and shitty ..historic is great, outdated and crumbling is not.) \n\n-Is your bridal suite amazing (open space with natural lighting and cozy furniture)  - this is where the future brides can imagine themselves getting ready with their closest friends - this is a big selling point. Consult with beauty vendors in your area!\n\n- is your venue difficult to work with ? (No good rain plan area, limited time to access, bad parking for guests, awkward layout for the wedding  ) \n\n- does it come with good catering?  Do brides have to pay for every small thing or do you include a lot?\n\nIs your venue able to accommodate other groups such as showers, parties , dinners ? Many venues in my area offer \nBrunches and special dinners (holidays ) to bring in off season money.\n\n\nYour seo and marketing might be good in paper but are you looking at your venue as a bride ? Would you drop 30k on your venue ? Maybe go tour your competition and see what they offer. \n\nWedding venues should make absolutely bank. The most successful in my area do 3 weddings per weekend in our busy season - fri/sat /sun,  have amazing catering and charge $30k-45k base .

This is my first comment on something in small business sub. \n\nYour situation is likely a marketing and customer relations issue.\n\nSaying the market has changed or slowed or what ever is a cop-out. Market conditions are always changing and it’s the owner/operators job to predict and plan for every scenario. As an entrepreneur you’re always going to have times where you’re flying a little to close to the sun. \n\nSo in this situation I would ask - who is your target customer and how do you get in front of them? \n\nWell the question is nuanced because who is the real decision maker? The groom? The bride? The planner? The mother of bride? The person who’s paying for it? … every situation is different. \n\nBut there is one thing that is constant… the planner. If you want consistency in your business you need to build airtight relationships with all the planners in the area so that when they do a venue presentation you’re always on the list. \n\nBut how do you do that? Well here is the “fun” part. You have to work the phones and door knock. Small gifts work too once you have a budding relationship. Pick the top 100 planners and make it your mission to get in contact with all of them over the next 30 days. Sometimes it means showing up to their office or phone calls or mailers. And make sure to build a deep personal relationship when you have a planner on-site. Also - All this has to be you - very important - can’t hire this out. \n\nLast thing is the planners are going to ask “what’s in it for me”. As you know most planners take a percentage of vendor sales which is often disclosed in the contract with the client. Figure out appropriate incentives for the planners based on the industry standard.\n\nThis is the hard target market that nobody wants to work. Much harder than buying an ad or writing an SEO page. Well in business that’s where the money is  - the boring hard stuff",

Our BCBS rates are going up to 2400 a month with no pre-existing conditions.  The subsidies have expired.  We didn't renew by the Dec 15 in hopes something would get done in Congress because we can still enroll by Jan 15th.  I just do not understand how Health insurance with huge deductibles can actually cost 2400 for 2 people.  My mother who is 76 and lives with me because she has late stage Alzheimers pays 280 a month with Aetna because she was civil service and Federal government subsidizes her healthcare.  She doesnt get Medicare because she didnt pay enough into it but at 280 a month, she is good.  This entire system is a joke.  I feel like I am being punished or farmed.\n\nMy question is what are some other options?  Maybe just catastrophic insurance and then Primary care use cash.  We are trying to save to retire but with Homeowners insurance going up every year as well as Auto insurance and now this.  Its simply unsustainable.\n\nEdit:\n\nI wanted to add a very weird fact to this all.  One of the many reason i have no trust in insurance companies.  A few years ago Humana pulled out of our county and we had to change insurance providers.  We ask why but in short the reason was they lost money or the zone we live wasnt profitable, blah blah.  The irony when I saw them place 400 piece order with our gift shop later that month.  They obviously are not hurting on money",

          "body": "I don't have any great recommendation for you because the the options are really slim unfortunately. But here is some info:\n\nInsurance companies calculate your premiums according to the following things:\n\n* Your age\n* sex\n* zip code \n* smoker or non smoker\n\nThey use these benchmarks to calculate the risk they are taking by bringing you on board. Your medical conditions don't matter anymore because of you are on an ACA plan. The older you are, the higher the cost. Men are more expensive than women because they have more medical issues the older they get. The insurance companies in the United States exist to make money, so they price everything accordingly. \n\nThe price they come up with for insurance coverage whether you have an ACA plan from the marketplace, a plan from your employer, or even Medicaid and Medicare is the same. The price is the price. \n\nWhat you pay then depends on how much your employer covers, how much the government pays (ACA subsidies or medicaid or medicare). Insurance companies are raising their prices because the cost of healthcare continues to skyrocket and Republicans have decided that they don't want the government to pay for the ACA subsidies anymore, so individuals like your have to pay full price now, which is statistically higher than ever before.\n\nI used to work in insurance and honestly, the catastrophic plans are a scam and really difficult to navigate for someone who is not versed in their exclusions. You could get a private non ACA plan that will look at your medical history to get you approved, that is more affordable than your current plan, but it is not as comprehensive. There's a lot more to explain on how that works, but hopefully you get the gist. \n\nMy recommendation is to just eat the cost and stay fully insured. Being in your 50s with a business and a spouse to worry about, it;s not worth the risk .",

Some were clever, some were punitive, some were incentives, they even tried something illegal, until that got shut down. Nothing worked. There was always at least one person late, every single day. And usually 2 or 3, out of staff of about 25. And it was always one or more of the same 8 or so people showing up late. Nothing worked.\n\nFinally, the owner gave up, and quietly approached the half dozen or so of us who were always on time or early, and just asked us to deal with it. For a price. Here, Uncle, here’s a $50 gift card. Hey, a vendor gave me this nice bottle of bourbon, but I don’t drink. You take it. Oh, she needs to leave two hours early today for a doctor’s appointment? We’ll just overlook that and pay her for the entire day. Hey Bob, these widgets aren’t selling, and you mentioned how nice they were. Why don’t you remove them from inventory as a store expense and take them home?\n\nThat was a pretty good system, because the people who were conscientious felt taken care of, and the people who were always late didn’t feel like they were constantly getting in trouble. In fact, it made the late people a little more conscientious, because there wasn’t always someone annoyed at them. It wasn’t a perfect system, but it made the owner think “who can I reward this week” rather than “who do I have to punish this week?”\n\nI still have a nice clock radio I got from that job.",

But then those leads bounce when they hit the site.\n\nThe ad will be specific to their offering with a great hook that gets people interested. \n\nBut then they'll send that lead to the main business website. And that website lists 5 services that don't match the offer. Now the lead is lost and they bounce.\n\nI saw this recently with someone running ads for legal coaching. His ad had a click-through rate that you'd think would generate a 4x or so return on ad spend. But he was barely at 2x. Not at all terrible but was definitely missing out.\n\nWith a separate landing page just for the coaching, the same ad started to perform at a 3x. \n\nThe disconnect is expensive. You're paying for clicks on a specific offer, then confusing people when they land.\n\nIf you're advertising coaching, the landing page should only show coaching. If you're advertising meal prep, only show meal prep.\n\nIt should be this simple:\n\n* What is your offer?\n* Does the page you're sending them to deliver ONLY that thing?\n\nIf not, make a simple landing page first. Even a basic one-pager should perform better than a generic homepage. ",

I am using it the same way small businesses have always used better tools, as a force multiplier that lets me do more with the same amount of time and energy.\n\nAI does not run my business. I do. It helps me draft, research, summarize, sanity check ideas, and move faster through the boring parts so I can spend more time on the work that actually matters. Talking to customers. Making decisions. Building relationships. If anything, it gives me back time to be more human, not less.\n\nThe fear that we will forget how to do things ourselves assumes people blindly outsource their brains. That is a choice, not a requirement. Calculators did not kill math. Spreadsheets did not kill accounting. Email did not kill communication. The people who understand the tool and keep their skills sharp are the ones who benefit. The ones who abdicate responsibility get weaker, and that has always been true with or without AI.\n\nAs for cost and dependency, small businesses already rely on software, platforms, utilities, and vendors every single day. The difference is that AI finally gives small operators leverage that used to require staff or agencies. That is empowering, not dystopian.\n\nIf someone feels overwhelmed by AI hype, the answer is not to reject it outright. The answer is to use it intentionally. AI should make me more capable, not replace me. When used correctly, it is not a crutch. It is a power tool.\n\nA couple of really helpful non-techie books that I like that cover AI are:\n\n“Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI”\n\nhttps://amzn.to/49imjL8\n\n\n“Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future”\n\nhttps://amzn.to/493PobQ",

It does come with **challenges and risks**, but one should not get **overwhelmed or diminished** by it.

Last point: in the technology world, there are always free, open-source solutions.

So small businesses that offer financial, legal, and technical services close their doors without customers.

          "body": "From what I’m seeing, businesses that sit on top of real problems, not hype, will grow the fastest. A few stand out clearly.\n\nAI-enabled services for small and medium businesses will grow quickly. Not flashy AI startups burning cash, but practical automation. Things like customer support, bookings, quoting, finance admin, compliance, marketing, and internal tools. The winners will be the ones that package AI in a simple, trustworthy way and actually save time or money. The big challenge here is trust, data quality, and not overpromising. People are already tired of AI solves everything nonsense.\n\nHealthcare, wellbeing, and ageing-related services are going to explode. Populations are ageing, public healthcare systems are under pressure, and people are more willing to pay privately than ever before. This includes remote monitoring, home care, mental health support, preventative health, and assistive tech. The challenge is regulation, ethics, and delivering real outcomes rather than just apps and subscriptions that don’t move the needle.\n\nCybersecurity and digital trust businesses will grow steadily. As everything moves online and AI makes scams and attacks more convincing, security becomes a non-negotiable cost, not a nice to have. Small businesses are especially vulnerable and under-protected. Growth here will favour firms that simplify security and education, not those that rely on fear. \n\nNiche e-commerce and specialist brands will continue to outperform big generic retailers. People are happy to buy from smaller brands if they feel understood and looked after. This works best where there’s expertise, curation, or a strong story, not just cheaper prices. The challenge is margins, logistics, and not being crushed by ad costs. Community and repeat customers matter more than scale.\n\nEducation and reskilling businesses will grow, especially outside traditional institutions. People know that one career for life is gone. Short, practical learning that leads directly to better income or flexibility will win. This could be technical skills, business skills, or even trades done in smarter ways. The challenge is credibility. Too many courses overpromise and underdeliver, so trust and real-world results are everything.\n\nLocal services that use technology well will quietly do very well. Repair, installation, logistics, home services, and specialist maintenance aren’t going away. Businesses that layer tech, automation, and good customer experience on top of boring but necessary work will be hard to compete with.",

          "body": "That’s such a great question! As a franchise expert, I’m constantly looking at these exact trends to see where the \"smart money\" is moving.\n\nIf we look at the next 5–10 years, I see three specific areas that aren't just growing, they're becoming essential:  \n  \nSenior Care &amp; \"Age-in-Place\" Services: With the aging population (Boomers), there is a massive surge in demand for in-home care, senior moving services, and home modifications. It’s a very resilient sector because it’s a necessity, not a luxury.  \nEco-Maintenance &amp; Green Energy: It's no longer just about solar panels. Businesses focusing on EV charging station installation, battery storage, and \"green\" home services (like eco-friendly insulation or HVAC) are going to explode as infrastructure catches up with climate goals.  \nHealth &amp; Personalized Wellness: We’re moving away from \"big box\" gyms toward boutique, specialized health concepts—things like IV hydration, longevity clinics, and tech-enabled mental health services. People are willing to pay a premium for health \"optimization\" rather than just basic fitness.\n\nThe biggest challenge? It’s definitely going to be **labor**. Finding and keeping quality people is the hurdle every business owner faces right now. That’s why systems and automation are so huge, the businesses that win will be the ones that use technology to make their human staff more efficient.\n\nIt’s an exciting time to be building. Are you looking at these trends from an investment standpoint, or are you thinking about starting something of your own?",

Talking to other vendors, it's that way for everyone from the farmers to the crafters and hot food vendors. My business is a dog bakery. I feel so bad when I see the dogs I know wanting to run over to me but the owners trying to quickly guide them away. Some of them have told me recently they have to watch their spending so they are rationing the treats. I told them to come by and let their dogs get my samples regardless of whether or not they can buy anything. The dogs don't understand keeping a budget. I know they'll buy again when they can. The way things have been going, I'm having to scale back the business to only the weekends and focus on regular work as a web developer and digital marketing - the bakery will just be a hobby business going forward. Fortunately, I am finding some work with digital marketing so I can make it work - this takes the pressure off of the bakery being my sole source of income.

You don’t need permission, a boss, or a formal application to try. That lack of friction gets misinterpreted as lack of difficulty.\n\nWhat’s often left out is that simplicity at the start usually trades places with complexity later. The hours, risk, uncertainty, and emotional load don’t disappear, they’re just not front-loaded the way a 9–5 is.\n\nThere’s also survivorship bias and platform incentives at play. People who made it through tend to talk about the freedom and autonomy, while the stress, failed attempts, and long unprofitable stretches don’t perform well on social media.\n\nSo I don’t think most people mean “easy” as in low effort. They mean:\n\nno formal barrier to entry\n\nautonomy instead of structure\n\nupside without a salary cap\n\n\nWhether that’s preferable to a 9–5 really depends on someone’s risk tolerance, financial buffer, and what kind of stress they handle better.

My friend Susan that is a CFO works about 70+ hours a week and has for 25 years. My wife works about 45 hours a week. Neither Susan or my wife HAVE to, but it's in their blood. But neither could run a business, they admit that. Then I have a sister Linda that works 30 hours a week and is broke all the time. Linda also complains about her job and how broke she is. I've always told Linda if she ever wants to start a business I am here for anything she needs including that first $100.... 35 years later she is still broke and complaining. But to be fair, I'll call this one even as well even though business should get the point.\n\nI made enough money in my service business to retire after 20 years at age 50. Not many 'regular' jobs will do that.\n\nBUT... owning a business is not for everyone. Lots of people are meant to work for someone else and complain about it every day, really. Then when those people get laid off/ fired, they worry and spend countless hours looking for a job and making no money until they finally find another job. But that is how we all grew up and were taught, it's not our fault we were all taught that. \n\nIf I was broke and my business closed today... I could start another service business tomorrow and be making money by the end of the week. Mowing, cleaning houses, washing windows, handyman, junk removal.... what ever it takes if I was broke. \n\nOne trick is to make enough money in your business to be able to pay others to do what you don't want/ like to do.

That part *is* more straightforward than navigating corporate ladders, politics, performance reviews, and permission structures. But execution-wise, it’s usually harder than a 9–5 in almost every dimension you listed: hours, stress, risk, and ambiguity.\n\nThe people framing it as “easy” usually fall into one of three buckets:\n\n* **They’re selling something** (courses, coaching, vibes).\n* **They already crossed the hardest phase** and forgot what it felt like.\n* **They’re confusing autonomy with ease.** Owning your time feels lighter, even if you’re working more.\n\nWhat doesn’t get talked about enough is that early-stage business difficulty isn’t the *work* itself, it’s the cognitive load. You’re the CEO, ops manager, bookkeeper, sales, compliance, and customer support simultaneously. A 9–5 externalizes most of that complexity.\n\nIronically, this is also why so many small businesses struggle long-term. Not because the idea is bad, but because operations never get systematized, so the founder stays stuck carrying everything in their head.\n\nThat’s actually the problem we’re trying to address with Quorum (still in beta). Not making business “easy,” but making the operational side less chaotic once things start working—so founders can build systems instead of just enduring stress. It’s not for everyone, and it doesn’t remove risk, but it helps reduce the constant context-switching that burns people out.\n\nThe honest framing should be: starting a business isn’t easier than a 9–5. It’s just a different kind of hard, and some people prefer *that* kind of hard. For those who do, having real operational structure matters a lot more than the motivational slogans people post online.\n\nIf relevant: [https://usequorum.app](https://usequorum.app)",

One path forward could be to break down your goals into smaller, manageable steps. I remember when I launched my first venture; I spent about three hours every morning for several weeks researching my target audience. Initially, my outreach was disheartening, I was getting maybe one reply from 50 emails sent out, and it felt like shouting into the void. But after two weeks of refining my approach and making adjustments based on feedback, I saw my response rate improve from around 2% to 15%, which really reignited my motivation. What strategies have you considered trying to better connect with your potential customers?",

I was over £14,000 in debt and this genuinely felt like my last shot at turning my life around. I didn’t quit my job or take some blind leap, I kept working a normal job while building the business on the side, I knew absolutely nothing at the start. While working, I listened to podcasts. When I got home, I applied what I’d learned. I made zero sales for the first 3-4 months. But I never viewed that as “failing” I viewed it as building something.\n\nFast forward to today:\n\t•\tFirst year revenue just over £220,000\n\t•\t£110,000 of that in the last 3 months\n\t•\tNo staff (just me and my wife)\n\t•\tI’ve quit my job\n\t•\tPaid off all my debt\n\t•\tBought a house\n\t•\tRetired my wife\n\t•\tBought a car\n\t•\tStarted a second online business 3 months ago that’s already done £25,000\n\t•\tPlanning a third business in January\n\nIs it easy? No.\nIs it anywhere near as hard as some of these comments make out? Also no.\n\nA lot of people talk about taxes, bookkeeping, ads, websites, logistics etc as if they’re insurmountable obstacles, they're not, they’re just skills you learn over time. Problems don’t disappear, but you solve them as they arise.\n\nToday I work 2-3 hours a day. Problems still happen, but I’d much rather fix occasional issues for this level of reward than work 10 hour days to earn in a week what I now make in half a day.\n\nIf I had read comments like many of these before starting, I probably wouldn’t have tried and that would have cost me everything I have today.\n\nStarting a business isn’t “easy”, but it’s also not this impossible, soul destroying nightmare people describe I have more freedom now in my life than I've ever had. Most people fail not because it’s too hard, but because they quit before the compounding effect kicks in.\n\nFor the person who asked the original question,\nDon’t let other people’s fear decide for you, take the very small risk whilst working a normal job and learn, you'll find out very quickly if it is or isn't for you.",

Trading a boss for responsibility, building something you control, and betting on yourself can feel lighter than a job that drains you, even if it’s harder on paper.\n\nSo yeah, anyone can start a business, but not everyone should, and it’s definitely not the “easy” path.",

It's one of the big advantages of owning your own business and if you're not doing it that's a ton of money on the table. Save the receipt, write on it what it was for, save it in your bookkeeping software to reference if you ever get audited. This applies to literally any reasonable expense that could be justified as marketing costs that would not have happened if you didn't own a business. Reasonable means reasonable - client gifts absolutely count, but not if the gift is like... a jet ski or if your client is actually your aunt. Buying things they ask you to buy is even more clear cut - I would even say you're in the right to charge your client for milage and hours doing this. I wouldn't charge clients but definitely should be writing off that milage involved at the IRS milage tax rate.\n\n\nFyi - you don't need to charge to a biz card to do this. All that matters is the receipt. A business card isn't anything special - it a normal credit card in every sense of the word except one that is marketed towards businesses. You can write off stuff on your personal card and you can charge personal items to a business card, the IRS or the banks don't care at all.

I’m not a big agency it’s mostly me, working contract to contract with local companies and trying to grow steadily.\n\nThis season was unexpectedly busy, so I decided to hire a freelancer to help with editing and production. My intention was to scale responsibly and keep clients happy. Unfortunately, the collaboration didn’t work out. Deliverables were consistently late, and I ended up having to redo most of the work myself to meet client expectations.\n\nBecause of that rework, one client was lost, and several other projects fell behind schedule. As a result, some payments were delayed or withheld, which immediately affected my cash flow.\n\nRight now, I don’t have money. I let the freelancer go, but I couldn’t cover her last invoice, and now she’s threatening to sue me.\n\nI’m really sad. I know I’m not a big company, but things got out of hand, and I feel cornered from all sides.\n\nHas anyone else been through something like this?",

Yes, you do have to pay her. Make it your priority. If you truly can’t cover it now, be transparent and commit to a deadline. I assume you booked her for her time, not contingent on delivery. Just because you did not like the work doesn’t mean her time is free. \n2. Freelancers are not responsible for your client relationships, setting your scopes, or your timelines. You are. Her work may not have met your creative standards, but it’s on you to account for that review window and set internal deadlines when you commit to external deadlines and scopes. This is a basic responsibility of running your own shop versus working at one. \n3. Avoid hiring brand new help when you’re in a time crunch.

We used these for about 6 months. Good analytics on who's viewing your card. Pricing got steep when we scaled to our whole team though.  \n  \nMobilo - Best overall in my opinion. The cards are high quality, analytics are detailed, and the team management features actually work well. We can update everyone's info from one dashboard which saves a ton of time. Switched to these and haven't looked back.  \n  \nLinq - Decent option, more affordable than others. The customization is pretty limited and customer support was slow when we had issues. Works fine for basic use cases.  \n  \nBlinq - Newer company so not as proven. Interface is clean but missing some features we needed like lead tracking. Good if you're solo or a very small team.  \n  \nDot - Cheap cards but the app feels clunky. Had connectivity issues with certain phone models. Okay if you're on a tight budget but you get what you pay for.  \n  \nHiHello - Free option that's actually usable. Limited features compared to paid options but works for basic contact sharing. We used this before committing budget to a paid solution.  \n  \nFor a sales team I'd go with Mobilo. For orgs with solo sales members, any of the top 3 work fine.",

Its about as useful as the BBB at this point.\n\n\nTo make it even more clear, yelp views the businesses as their customers, not website visitors. By hiding the good reviews, it makes you more likely to pay. Especially if the cost is minimal compared to the \"costs\" (that one is hard to quantify) of leaving the bad yelp reviews.\n\n\nIts been my experience that people barely read the Google reviews in front of them, let alone going to a 3rd party site.",

Thing is, he didn’t live in my market (and didn’t even live in the same state anymore). He was simply a bully. I could tell by his ultra common grammar errors that it was him. I told Yelp that I never had a client by that (fake) name and that I had a contract for each and every client, so I could prove it. I also told them that they could look at his IP address and see that he wasn’t in my state and couldn’t possibly be my customer. In their \"infinite wisdom,” they said that they would not be giving me his IP address. I didn’t say, “listen here, you waste of oxygen” but my tone probably implied it when I said, “I didn’t ask you to TELL me his IP address; I asked you to LOOK at it as proof that the review is FAKE.” They would not relent. \n\nAnother time when they were trying to sell me ads, they wanted me to advertise in a city 3 hours away from me. I said I didn’t want to work in that city when I lived in this one. The sales guy knew nothing about my not-small industry and went on and on about grow the business to another city. I told him it didn’t make financial sense (as a sole proprietor) and that it was a giant environmental waste (all that gas going there and back). He actually said that gasoline and cars on the road weren’t environmental concerns. He also didn’t understand that 3 hours there and back was six hours that I wasn’t working….and that I couldn't make money sitting in the car. I told him that when the fake review had been down for 2x as long as it was up that I’d consider advertising with Yelp, but until then, they needed to put me on the Do Not Call list. Something worked because they quit calling.\n\nYelp is dumb dumb dumb dumbity dumb dumb dumb, and they hire people who are the same. \n\nI just looked, the fake review is still there. It’s hidden but there….right beside all my (also hidden) 5\\* reviews.

People pay for fake reviews, give discounts or things for free or fake reviews, and influencers almost always say positive stuff and purposely leave out the negative so they look cool. \"Hey, look where I'm at.

I hope people benefit from my negative review and I've heard the food isn't anything special and average at best.

Eg small package of cleaning paste of the  ceramic cooktop or something for bathroom mirrors. Or perhaps just a small chocolate with your packaging. Eg brand color + logo. \n\nIf you have like big clients or long-term clients. Try to convert them as your brand ambassadors. Maybe a larger merch they could use somehow. A floormatt.

If someone has ordered you to clean interior 5x then 6th time you do all the windows outside for free.   \nOr let's say you visit a neighbourhood with private houses.

Humans just remember smart / funny / quirky things - which impact recalls and potentially conversion. \n\nAnd it doesn't have to be complicated / expensive. You could even ask gpt for suggestions on both (tagline + logo). I imagine your target customer is a dual income household that doesn't have time. Here's a couple of example taglines:\n\n\"Delegate The Dirt To Me**\"**  \n\"CEO of your Dust\"  \n\"Your floor, my chore\"",

You just need to look like a safe bet.\n\nBest money you can spend right now? $20 on a branded polo shirt. Walking into a stranger's home in a uniform vs. street clothes makes a massive difference in how much they trust you.\n\nAlso, try leaving a physical paper checklist on the counter ticking off exactly what you cleaned.
