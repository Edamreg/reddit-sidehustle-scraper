      "selftext": "I stumbled into this completely by accident and now I'm kicking myself for not starting sooner. I was scrolling through Instagram and saw some lifestyle bloggers with decent followings but their websites were... rough. Slow loading times, no internal linking, missing alt tags - basic stuff that kills their Google rankings. So I sent a few DMs. Something like: *\"Hey, love your content! Just checked your site and noticed a few quick fixes that could boost your traffic. Would you be interested in a site optimization? I can have it done this week.\"*\n\nThe response rate shocked me. Out of 10 messages, 2-3 people responded interested. They were RELIEVED someone reached out. Most of them know their site has issues but have no idea how to fix it or think it'll cost thousands.\n\nWhat I actually do:\n\n* Run their site through free tools (PageSpeed Insights, Screaming Frog)\n* Fix image compression and lazy loading\n* Add internal links between their posts (I use help of SEOJuice for this - automates the whole thing in like 5 mins)\n* Update meta descriptions and titles\n* Fix broken links\n* Find ideas for content (thanks to competitors analysis which is also performed by this tool)\n\nTotal time: 20-30 minutes per site. Charge: $100. The best part?\n\nThese bloggers are genuinely happy. Their sites load faster, they start seeing better rankings, and they think I'm some kind of wizard. Meanwhile I'm literally just following a checklist I learned from YouTube.\n\nI'm doing 4-5 of these per week now. That's an extra $400-500 for maybe 3 hours of actual work (not counting the hours spent looking for such guys)\n\nI can't tell you where and how exactly I find these people because honestly, I don't need more competition in my niche 😂 But let's just say there are platforms where content creators hang out and complain about their website problems...\n\nMy advice if you want to try this:\n\n1. Learn basic SEO fixes (literally just watch a few YouTube videos)\n2. Find people with content but bad websites\n3. Reach out professionally, don't be spammy\n4. Deliver quick results\n5. Ask for testimonials to build credibility\n\nThe barrier to entry is incredibly low. You don't need to be an expert - you just need to know slightly more than the person you're helping.\n\nAnyone else doing something similar? Or am I the only opportunist here taking advantage of people's laziness to Google things? 😅",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I posted this in another subreddit and I got some heartwarming messages that it inspired them, so I'm going to share this with you, hopefully it can inspire some of you as well. (I don't have anything to sell, don't worry.)\n\nI’ve been doing Amazon KDP (Amazon's self publishing platform) since August of 2024, a little over a year now. It is possible to do it on the side, I didn't because I started with nothing. Literally. No money, living out of my car, and I needed to do something about my situation. I want to share my full experience scaling this from $0 to $150K revenue. The lessons I learned, and why I think KDP is nowhere near saturated as many claim.\n\nMy hope is that this post will give you value, motivation, and perspective, especially if you’re just starting out or feel stuck.\n\n# A Little Background\n\nI’ve always been into business, ever since i was a kid flipping Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh cards and other collectibles, plus video game currencies, items, accounts. Over the years I’ve tried everything: forex, stock trading, affiliate marketing, SEO blogs, dropshipping, customer acquisition/lead generation agency, CPA marketing, SMMA, POD, and of course KDP.\n\nJust to keep in mind, this is not my first time doing KDP. My first attempt was in 2019, but my account got banned in early 2020 for a few (frustrating) reasons:\n\n* I used a term, that a few months later got filled for trademark and Amazon flagged me, even tho the trademark was just pending and was rejected later.\n* Got hit with a “similar cover” strike ( I should have fought it, probably would have won. Not sure why I didn’t.)\n* Published a book called “Snarky Nurse Coloring Book” with the idea that the book was snarky (snarky quotes), not the nurse. Tt got reported by a brand called Snarky Nurse or something similar.\n\nAfter the third strike, Amazon didn’t let me appeal or explain myself, they kept sending the same generic response that the decision is final and nothing could be done.\n\nAfter all this I didn’t do anything, I got comfortable, had plenty in savings, some other life events happened during covid that I lost any motivation to do anything, until life forced me to start again.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nI’m not smart or special. Many people make much more with KDP than I do. But I’ve failed a lot, learned from my mistakes, and treated this like a real business. What I’ll share is what worked for me. Hopefully you’ll learn something useful from it and get some clarity on how you should approach this business if you decide to give it a shot.\n\n# Quick Stats:\n\n* Started: August 2024.\n* Books Published 148. (1 book every 3 days or so)\n* Total Revenue: \\~$150,000\n* Ad Spend: \\~$16,000\n* Employee Costs: \\~$24,000\n* Tools &amp; Subscriptions: \\~$2,500\n* TikTok Marketing Videos: \\~2,000\n* Profit (before tax): \\~100,000\n\nLast month, I made \\~$32,000 revenue, with \\~$10,000 in expenses.\n\n# Lessons, Tests &amp; Observations:\n\n1. **Quality vs. Quantity.** I’ve seen many YouTubers talk about focusing only on quality and to be honest I don’t fully agree. I started with quantity, not because I believed in mass publishing, but because I wanted data. I uploaded many somewhat decent quality books at first (most didn’t even hit 10 sales) and they helped me to identify which niches and formats had potential. Then I moved to more medium quality books, they took me 2-5 days each, in niches that showed potential and these confirmed the winners. I then outsourced even better versions and that’s where most of my revenue came from (excluding the unicorn). So it’s not quality or quantity, you need both to optimize your business.\n2. **Amazon ads.** I’m a numbers guy, I love data, tracking, testing everything. With amazon ads you obviously get more sales, but you also get an 20-30% bump in the organic sales. Sales boost your BSR, help you rank higher, which gets you more sales, more reviews, and all of this combined, a stronger foundation in the algorithm, making it more difficult for competitors to outrank you. So yes, ads are worth it, even beyond direct ROI. There’s another reason why I find ads even more important than getting sales. To be honest I didn’t even start them with the idea to make money from them directly. As I said, I love data, and amazon unfortunately shows you almost no valuable data at all. Running ads helps you a little bit as you can see the impressions you get, how many clicks you get and how many conversions, enough signal to see what’s working and what isn’t. It’s not ideal, but this is what we have to deal with when it comes to amazon.\n3. **Keywords.** Always use relevant keywords, leave fields if you don’t have anything relevant to add. I tested adding trending but not relevant keywords on a couple of books that had \\~20 sales a month each. Sales dropped to 4 and 6 the first month and 1 and 0 on the second month. Removing those irrelevant keywords didn’t restore the sales. Only running ads brought them back. Unrelated words hurt your relevance score, which can tank your book entirely\n4. **External ads.** I had some experimentation with meta ads, spend $600 and made \\~$450 above baseline over the next few months (sales doubled the month with the ads being run and slowly fell back to baseline). Still not enough data to fully judge, I’ll test this more, I need to spend at least $10,000 to have at least some opinion about this, and that’s what I’m going to do in the upcoming months.\n5. **A+ Content.** Almost always helps unless it’s really, really bad. I’ve tested many different layouts, worst ones had \\~10% increase in CVR, the best ones increased 80-150%, depending on the niche and design. Either way, it helps.\n6. **Cover Design (not just artsy, its psychology).** After niche selection, cover is the most important factor. People do judge a book by it’s cover If your design isn’t at least as good as top competitors in that niche, your book is gonna sink in the vast ocean that is Amazon. If you can afford it and your design skills aren’t great, I would suggest outsourcing covers to skilled designers. Still, do some of them yourself, to have a better understanding as not all of it is art, it’s more about the psychology of the customer, it is the pitch for your product. (Also the content of the book has to be good enough as well, because negative reviews can kill your book just as easily as bad cover, just a little slower).\n7. **Descriptions.** I’m not sure if I am just bad at writing them, but I never seen a big difference in CVR from it. The only thing that seems to matter in my experience is the formatting. The description still has to be informative and relevant to the book itself, but if it’s done in a big block of text it’s not gonna help. If it is formatted nicely, then I’ve seen 10-30% CVR improvements. The other thing that I’ve noticed is that having a relevant and informative description helps the book rank higher. It happened consistently enough to make me almost sure that Amazon’s algorithm rewards it.\n8. **Low Search Volume Niches (Small Margins Scale Big).** Pretty much every YouTube video I watched about KDP said to target niches that have high search volume of 1000+ at the minimum and ignore every one of them that get less. I often target niches other skip, even less than 500 searches per month. I care more about competitor strength and actual sales. If I feel I have a fighting chance against the competitor in that kind of niche, that has 100-200k BSR, then I’ll attack it. I get it, making books that are going to get 100-200 sales a month isn’t sexy, but over the year they make $1,200-$2,400, and ten, twenty, thirty, one hundred of these adds up to real income.\n9. **E-mail Lists.** These are great but I’ve only managed to make them work in two situations. In my unicorn niche, I built a list of 1,000+ via a variety of freebies. When I launched a supporting book with a release day discount, I emailed the list and got 200+ day one sales. I’m not saying that 20% of the email list converted, but even if 3-4% can create enough sales velocity to push the book up the rankings making it get even more sales and climb even higher up. Second, with my “client” brand (consumable books). We built the list by running promotional ads and in book freebies. After every weekly release, the email goes out and almost consistently gets 100 day one sales, some releases even get 200-300.\n10. **Short-Form Video Marketing.** One day I got bored and thought about trying out something new, I released a book in a very competitive niche(which means lot’s of interested people) and created a TikTok account to make videos for that book. After printing the book and recording a few videos, repurposing them, following trends, changing the hooks , etc., one video hit nearly 1m views. This led to over 2,000 sales in the first week after upload. Since then I’ve uploaded 250+ videos, hired other people to make videos for me and I’ve had a few other viral videos (not as bit as the original one tho).\n11. **Pricing.** Compete on the quality of your book rather than price, if your book is better than competitor’s, price it higher and position it as premium. Low price makes you look cheap, not “affordable”. The pricing is different depending on the niche and type of the book itself, so what I would recommend is to launch around the average competitor price, could be a little higher if you are confident in your book (that’s what I do), or price it just a little below the average. Monitor CVR, if it is solid, then increase the price by $1 and observe, if it gets too big of a hit, reverse the change if it doesn’t keep increasing the price. If the book ranks high, gets steady organic sales and reviews, push premium pricing.\n12. **99% of Gamblers Give Up Before They Hit it Big.** Okay, maybe not in gambling (please don’t). But in business? Mostly true. Most people give up right before they’ve learned enough both from theirs, and other people’s failures to make their business work. There’s plenty of money in almost every business. Imagine a gambler spinning the slots, after 30 failed spins, he hits jackpot. Business it’s similar, keep testing, keep learning, fail, tweak it, try again. Do that 30 times and on attempt 31 it suddenly looks like you “got lucky”(You didn’t. You just didn’t quit.) If you knew that you were 30 failures away from your dream, would you keep going?\n13. AI Tools as Assistants, Not Crutches Do not let AI do all the work for you. You won’t really learn what’s working and the quality will be subpar. People notice that the book was written by AI and leave negative reviews. Use it to brainstorm ideas, rough outlines, keyword ideas that you’re gonna validate, even sketch A+ layouts. Always double check the accuracy (AI likes to hallucinate) and IP. AI speeds you up, significantly, but it doesn’t do the job for you.\n14. **KDP plateau.** Plateaus do happen at every stage. I sat at a bit over $6,000 per month for a while, luckily for me it was a decent enough revenue to stay motivated. Some people, especially beginners, plateau at $0 per month, or they reach $500 in the first months, stall for a few months, assume “KDP is dead” and quit. It’s not. It’s just lag and learning. The move isn’t to quit, it’s to keep publishing and keep making small improvements. Eventually you’ll break out. Keep going, keep measuring, keep improving and then the compounding finally shows up.\n15. **Outsourcing and delegating.** All of this is going to depend on your budget and skill level. I hire people to go faster, not to disappear. I keep strategy, ads, research, final approval and hand off stuff like covers, interiors, basic edits, videos. I also do some books fully myself to keep improving and learning. At first you should do everything yourself, to learn as much as possible, to even know what to ask your employees to do, to be able to make SOPs for them. Eventually when you can no longer keep up with the amount of books you want to make, you start hiring. Track cost per title, have an idea on how fast the contractors work, how long it is going to take to make a book. Keep light P M Cadence, do weekly check-ins, have a QC checklist before anything goes live. Plan so that one person’s vacation doesn’t stall launches. Pay on time, give bonuses when earned, give specific feedback, promote your A-players.\n16. **Treat it like a real business and I mean REAL business.** KDP isn’t a lottery ticket, it’s a real publishing business. I budget, track unit economics and make decisions off numbers, not vibes. That means knowing your CTR/CVR, ACOS/TACOS, margin, payback time (how long till the book repays it’s investment), opportunity cost, LTV per title and more. Keep a simple P&amp;L, reinvest into ads, books, testing, learning. Write SOPs for contractors, kill or fix anything that doesn’t earn its shelf space. Manage your cashflow, plan for seasonality, keep runway for tests, don’t starve the winners. Be boringly safe on ToS/IP and make sure to set aside money for taxes. Real business = clear goals, clean and tight processes, consistent iteration.\n17. **You need action much more than you need information.** Most people don’t have a knowledge problem, they have a doing problem. You can binge every KDP video, read every post in KDP forums and still have $0 in royalties because you never uploaded anything. On top of that you’re gonna forget most of the stuff you watched either way if you do not try to implement it almost immediately. When and if you’ll start taking action, you’ll go back and start rewatching those videos again with context. Learn just enough to take action. By taking action you’ll learn the most. Half baked action beats perfect research because market teaches faster than any tutorial. Most importantly be consistent with your action, and consistently improve with it.\n\n# Key Takeaways\n\nKDP is not oversaturated. People said that it was already “too late” back in 2019 when I first started, and they’ll say the same in 2030. The real difference is how you treat KDP. Treat it like a real business. Track data. Build Systems. Reinvest Profits. TEST RELENTLESSLY. Be consistent and improve every week. Stagnation is death, and even to maintain your level, you have to keep evolving because the competition is evolving. Plan your week. Every Sunday, I write down my tasks and deadlines. And I need to do them. No excuses. That habit alone kept me on track for 60-70 hours a week for over a year.\n\n# My Goals for the Future\n\nThis December my plan is to get to $100,000 - the coveted six figure month. I know it’s possible, because December sales can triple or quadruple.  \nBut my goals don’t stop here.\n\n**My next milestone for 2026:**  \n$1,000,000 in total revenue  \n$253k+ in December 2026 alone.  \nThe reason for that specific figure is that back in 2020 I spoke with someone who made $252K in December 2019 with a team consisting of her and her husband. I’m going to have a bigger team than that to try to hit this number, but let’s ignore that fact.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis year has been life-changing. I went from being broke and sleeping in my car to running a six figure publishing business. I don’t think that this was luck. It was consistency, constant improvement, and treating KDP like the serious business it is. If you’re reading this and were thinking about quitting. DON’T. Keep going, test things, learn from your data, stay disciplined. Do not think “What if it’s not going work out? What if I fail?”. Think “What if everything does work out?”.",

Somethings you could flip as is and some stuff you could fix up a bit and sell for a bit more. \n\nIf you've got 2 hours a day/14 hours a week you could average more than $20/day. \n\nThe other idea is look into Task Rabbit. You basically post yourself as being available for odd jobs. Could be anything from cleaning, organizing, yard work, etc.  Any odd job around the house you can think of you can find someone on Task Rabbit to do. You set your price and you work with the client to set specific day and time so you can work around your schedule to some degree.",

          "body": "I grew up in a similar family. Don't discuss with them any work you're doing to improve your situation. That's going to be hard if you don't have a support system outside of your home, but you have to expect that there will be attempts to sabotage anything you're doing to improve yourself and remove the amount of control they have over your life right now. Do what you can to find some real friends in your area to connect with. Start slowly leaving the house more often. Have a friend teach you how to drive until you can get your license, without telling your family. I'm assuming they wouldn't let you borrow their car to use on your driving test. Idk if there are driving schools in your area that can help with that or if a friend will let you use theirs. Where I live you have to provide a car to drive for the road test when getting your license.\n\nPeople don't understand that if you don't have money, can't drive legally, and don't have a support system, it's not as easy as just leaving. Leave and go where? Any skills you start learning, keep it to yourself as much as possible. Any money you start saving up, keep it a secret. If your family is using you as their free caregiver and servant, you have to expect that upsetting the status quo is going to upset them and that they'll do their best to stop it. When I was 19, I had to move out of state before I could get control over my life and money finally. It got to the point where my parents started using the money I made at my job and set aside for my tuition and savings towards moving out for fun gifts for themselves. There's a huge difference between being ungrateful and being in a highly controlling and abusive home where your parents aren't allowing you to lead an independent life or learn the skills you need in order to do that. Good luck to you.",

Even more important, the company was mission-driven so I could also talk to customers about mission while I was under their sink (a bit of a weird visual)\n\nThe company ended up launching nationwide on Shark Tank a couple years later and got acquired, but it was the lessons learned from the gritty night/weekend days that built the foundation!\n\nCheering for everyone in this group!

Both through blog and social media affiliate marketing. Here's the ones I'm bullish on for 2026 and why. Also, I am not affiliated with any of them because I'm now out of the game (still make a few thousand a month) running a 7 figure social agency, but still find this stuff super interesting:\n-Booking.com: Seriously. Reason being: big % payout AND it's applicable to anyone. Easy approval too. You can see how this could work -- next time your friend is booking a vacation, just send them your link. Hand-to-hand combat like this can yield pretty decent payouts. \n-Otterly AI: Any of the LLM visibility tools are great as affiliate partners today. Every company wants to see how they appear in ChatGPT for generative engine optimization. The tools are new, conversion rates are relatively high, and ATV is really, really high (~$10k+ per year). Ranking for the search terms in Google is still possible because it's an emerging space. \n-Vista Social: I'm very bullish on channel/affiliate program alignment. This is what I mean: if you have a big presence on social (say Instagram), it's easy to promote tools that operate for that channel. That makes tools like Vista Social powerful affiliates. Highest conversion window in that space + 20% recurring commission. \n-Canva: Same deal. Very good channel/affiliate alignment. If you're on any visual channel with clout -- Insta, TikTok, Pinterest, etc. You can sell Canva -- it's universal to those users. \n-Sofi: So many use cases, 4-figure bounties on some products. No rule against retargeting ads, which can work quite well. \n-ChartPrime: Easy sell with many use cases. 30% commission and an AOV over $400. \n\nWhat others?",

      "selftext": "This is a continuation of one of my posts from about 5 months ago which began like this: \n\n\"So I began looking for ways to earn extra income during my long breaks at work. Here's the journey so far:\n\n1. Online Surveys – I made a few dollars, but quickly realized it wasn’t worth the time or effort.\n2. Bank Churning – I learned how to take advantage of sign-up bonuses and made a few thousand dollars. However, it wasn’t sustainable since offers can take over a year to become available again.\n3. Social Casinos – I discovered sweepstakes-based casino sites and started logging into 20+ of them daily, mostly playing blackjack. This earned me around $500/month.\n4. AMOE (Mail-In Entries) – I learned that I could send physical envelopes to social casinos to receive free Sweeps Coins. I created a system to streamline the writing process. I made around $10,000 in the first year and have made about $14,000 so far this year.\n5. Researched Amazon Dropshipping, retail arbitrage, FBA/FBM. Looked into creating my own products to sell. Created an Amazon merchant account. Bought shipping supplies. In the end, things didn't pan out.\n6. AI Content Creation – I learned how to generate AI models using Stable Diffusion, including NSFW images and videos through platforms like Civitai. I launched an Instagram page featuring sexy AI models and paid $25 to gain \\~700 followers (mostly fake or inactive). I also started a Fanvue page for NSFW content. I got 1 subscriber at $9.99/month, but they canceled within the first month. Since then, my follower count has dropped to around 530, and I currently have no subscribers.\n7. Niche Instagram Account – About a week ago, I created a new Instagram page focused on a specific niche I saw performing well. The first few days were slow with zero views, but then one video went semi-viral, which boosted the rest of my content. In the past 8 days, I’ve grown from 0 to over 1,200 followers, gaining 100+ per day. My current view range is 6k (yesterday's post) – 129k (semi-viral video from about 5 days ago).\n\nNext Steps\n\n8. Fanvue (Round 2) – I plan to launch a second Fanvue page with NSFW content once this new Instagram account hits 10,000 followers (hopefully within a month). I'm also researching Instagram monetization options based on view count.\n\n9. TikTok Expansion – I’ll be repurposing my content for TikTok and exploring monetization through the Creator Fund or other methods.\n\n10. YouTube Strategy – I plan to expand to YouTube. While YouTube Shorts don’t pay much even with high views, I’m considering ways to transition into longer-form content that can generate ad revenue and improve profitability.\n\nI feel extremely lucky to have succeeded with my 2nd Instagram account so quickly while others have struggled, including me. The point is to not give up, research, learn new tools, figure out what works, what doesn't, and try again.\n\nThanks for reading.\"\n\nSo that was 5+ months ago. Where am I now?\n\n1. My biggest and best money-maker (made \\~$30k?), social casinos, are being banned in many states, including mine, so now the process of using pen plotters to automate the writing process is useless. (Now, don't ask me how I'm doing this unless you're willing to pay me or buy 1 or more of my pen plotters which are collecting dust. I paid about $400/plotter, I have 4. I'll sell for $200)\n\n2. I had 2 instagram accounts, one focused on sexy asians in skimpy bikinis while the other was more western-girls focused. The niche Instagram account I mentioned earlier is focused on muscly girls in skimpy bikinis. The asian girl account wasn't performing well so I decided to close that account and combine asians and all other girls into my main niche account. The viral video I mentioned before is now at 2.1 million views. I have about 19k followers on my Instagram account, about 3k on my Tiktok account, and 4 followers on my new Facebook account. All this in about 5 months.\n\nMAKING MONEY ON SOCIAL MEDIA \n\nI think at about 5k followers on Instagram, the subscriber feature becomes available which allows followers to subscribe for exclusive content. I charge 4.99 and have 30 subscribers. Only 8 of them are paying and the rest are on a free 7 day trial so the numbers fluctuate.\n\nHowever, my plan was to redirect traffic with links to adult sites and charge a subscription. I ran into trouble with Fanvue after they decided my AI girls looked too young and banned me and threated legal action if I made a new account...great. Then I created an account on Fansly and gained some subscribers there but got banned again because apparently all models, whether real or AI, need real identification. I didn't give up and looked for others. Patreon? No realistic porn allowed. I settled on Dfans where I now reside. \n\nI wasn't sure how to advertise my Dfans on Instagram besides posting the link in my bio. Oh, I realized you're not allowed to directly link an adult site from instagram so I used a site called beacons(dot)ai which is safe for Instagram and allows me to link other sites. I use it for Tiktok as well. On Instagram, I mention my beacons link often in my videos, either through the description or on texts overlayed on videos. I've been aggressively promoting my Beacons (Dfans) link for about a month now. I sit at 17 subscribers on Dfans @ 9.99/subscriber. Dfans takes 20%. I'm disappointed that I only have 17 subs with nearly 19k followers on Instagram and 3k on Tiktok. ChatGPT said that 1% of followers subscribing is reasonable. So I should have at least 190 subs = $1,900/month before Dfans takes 20%. Tiktok is horrible for my type of content because 90% of my bikini girl videos either gets removed or restricted for content violations. I appeal and get most of my videos restored but I racked up a couple of strikes and am in danger of being banned on the platform. \n\nI also posted my content on Youtube Shorts and within a month or two, my channel got banned for whatever reason.\n\nI'm now posting on Facebook and within a month I have like 4 followers. Be patient.\n\nI uploaded some NSFW content on my other account and a Redditor messaged me asking for custom content. I made like $600 in a month from him. \n\nAnother redditor asked me to create ads for them after I uploaded a short film. \n\nLEVERAGING AI SKILLS\n\nNow that I'm pretty skilled with AI image/video generation. I decided to create a Youtube channel focused on study/relaxing music with cinematic AI videos. I repurposed my dormant Youtube channel from like 15+ years ago which had 2.8k subscribers. I barely have any views but I'm hoping to upload a 1-2 hour video every 1-2 weeks so hopefully the algorithm will notice me.\n\nEtsy. I decided to open an Etsy store with my AI art. I picked a niche and went for it. I knew I wanted to create different kinds of artwork so I chose a generic name for my shop. I used artwork from a book that was popular when I was young and colorized it for Halloween. So far, I made about $150 in about 1.5 months. ChatGPT helped with SEO when naming products, tagging, and description. Copywritten work? Yes, but others on Etsy were selling it so I said, what the hell, I'll take it down if they tell me.\n\nI have a subscription to Suno for music, ComfyUI for NSFW image/video gen, OpenArt for my AI image/video generations, Midjourney for inspiration and image gen, and ChatGPT for prompting and ideas.\n\nWhat now?\n\nKeep improving and being persistent. Persistence and consistency is key. I could have given up many times along the way but I'm stubborn and want to succeed. I used to play a lot of video games and now I treat this as a real life game that has real world benefits. I invest money into the tools that are going to help me succeed and work hard for the payout.\n\nWhy are you giving away your secrets?\n\nI don't know if it's a secret but this path is a difficult one. I'm documenting this here because I want to know how far I've come in another 5+ months. Another reason is because I know that 99.9% of the people that read this don't have it in them to hustle and grind. I realized this when I was writing my social casino postcards. I told people around me to do it because it's free money but 0% did it because it required work.\n\nTo the .1%, keep grinding.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If better pics could help them catch even *some* of those lost customers, maybe they'd pay for that.\n\nBefore you call it a “shitty idea,” remember this: restaurant owners who’ve run their business for years don’t buy anything that would mislead their customers. They bought because the quality matched what they actually serve.\n\nMy goal wasn’t to make cheap-looking AI pics. I recreated the dish exactly how it’s served, just styled and lit properly, like it would be in a pro studio shoot.\n\nSo I made a list of places with awful-looking menus.  \nThen I used ChatGPT’s image tool to generate nicer versions—pro-style, appetizing, clean backgrounds. No camera. No food. Just AI prompts.\n\nI emailed each business with two free sample images based on their menu.  \nSuper simple message. No pitch. Just:  \n“Hey, I tried reimagining your dishes like this.”\n\nSome ignored it.  \nSome replied.  \nAnd a few asked for a full set of menu pics.\n\nI wasn’t charging much - around €150 per client, but after a while I was making around €1K/month, just working with businesses in my area.\n\nZero experience.

      "selftext": "Major info from my last post first- (Posted 2 months ago)\n\n—-\n\nSo I got to know I have a severe heart condition in January that needed an urgent procedure to happen in order for me to live. I got it done, lots of paranoia and a long recovery made me try out a few major online side hustles as I took a long break from my job. Here’s what worked for me and can work for you too!\n\nActual Book Publishing (Amazon KDP)-  So writing has been my passion since a long time and I had this fairytale story written from like the past 2 years, so I gave it a try and published it with a nice cover and a little self done social media marketing it cost me $500 total to format it, cover artists and some social media posts. It’s earning 100$/month since! I have another book planned but won’t publish it until next year.\n\nNext was Ebooks, simply taking a burning issue or a very niche idea and creating a how to guide (purely Chatgpt) but NOT AI SLOP! Something that has value and people use it. I made 2 books and felt it was a bit boring for me, it costed me 100$/book and I made like 20$ from each till now. This literally has a huge potential if done properly and genuinely you can make 10-15 books a month, even if 1 blows up you are set for life!\n\nFacebook Pages- So a little background, in the place I worked I used to manage a lot of pages like this (this was pre facebook monetisation era) but as FB started monetising content even pictures and text posts, It became a full blown business! As I was off from work I focused on one page of my own and grew it to almost 100k followers in 6 months (it had 10k in Jan)\n\nThis page earns me almost $1000, every month since March and it’s only increasing. The only thing I do is make 5 posts a day, literal photos and maybe some graphics like quote posters every once in a while.\n\nYouTube - This has been my favourite! So there’s a very good niche of explainer videos that you must have seen! It’s just simply explaining stuff that’s interesting. It maybe sports, Entertainment, movies, science, money anything! I myself preferred motorsports so I went with that! This month is my 3rd month being monetised and I earned around $3000 till today (I started in July End, monetised in Sep 1st Week) This thing helped me find potential people who wanted to do the same thing and as I recruited a lot of video editors for myself I asked them to work with me with a few bucks overcharge (If I pay 50 for a 15 min video I ask $60) and this helped me earn a $200 from my first client.\n\nSo yeah! That’s pretty much it, I will be uploading proofs in comments if People want, I just wanted to post this and let people know that there is always light at the end of the tunnel and if you are willing to work and maybe spend a little money, the universe has a great way of returning it in multiple folds!\n\nNow Update- (I have helped 3 people who are doing Facebook, 2 are doing Youtube with me) Now the monthly earnings are increasing to almost $3k in profits (1k from facebook, $2k from YouTube, around $100 from books)\n\nAlso, I am walking regularly now… little steps… I know but We will get there soon! \n\nSo ama I guess, I will try to help out as many people as I can, just like last time :)",

          "body": "A decent side hustle I've been doing is looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than any initial cost. It's a form of arbitrage, and it can make you an extra couple hundred each month. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives those offers higher, creating more opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how it works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

If better pics could help them catch even *some* of those lost customers, maybe they'd pay for that.\n\nBefore you call it a “shitty idea,” remember this: restaurant owners who’ve run their business for years don’t buy anything that would mislead their customers. They bought because the quality matched what they actually serve.\n\nMy goal wasn’t to make cheap-looking AI pics. I recreated the dish exactly how it’s served, just styled and lit properly, like it would be in a pro studio shoot.\n\nSo I made a list of places with awful-looking menus.  \nThen I used ChatGPT’s image tool to generate nicer versions—pro-style, appetizing, clean backgrounds. No camera. No food. Just AI prompts.\n\nI emailed each business with two free sample images based on their menu.  \nSuper simple message. No pitch. Just:  \n“Hey, I tried reimagining your dishes like this.”\n\nSome ignored it.  \nSome replied.  \nAnd a few asked for a full set of menu pics.\n\nI wasn’t charging much - around €150 per client, but after a while I was making around €1K/month, just working with businesses in my area.\n\nZero experience. No portfolio. Just an idea, free tools, and a bit of time.\n\nIf you’re broke or starting from scratch, this might be worth trying. It’s super easy to do and doesn’t take much time at all.",

Same 30-second result, but it's their real dish looking professional.\n\nWhy enhancement beats generation for this business:\n\n1. Way easier to sell - Restaurant owners trust it more (no fake food concerns)\n2. No customer backlash - Customers get exactly what they see, just styled better\n3. Fully automated - No spending hours on ChatGPT prompts per restaurant\n\nFor anyone wanting to replicate OP's success: The opportunity is 100% real. Use MenuPhotoAI to handle the tech, you handle sales and client relationships. Same hustle, better product, none of the ethical drama. Feel free to DM me and I can help set you up.  \nHere's a real before-after image uploaded by a restaurant owner and enhanced with MenuphotoAI.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8e632sg2jz2g1.jpeg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8eb311d08ed760197e75ed8ed699cd457f13e3fc",

Hours are weird, pay is meh, and I spend half my day telling people their membership expired.\n\nFrom May to Oct, I chased \"passive income.\" Spoiler: nothing about it was passive.\n\n**What flopped:**\n\nReselling sneakers - Took Ls on every drop. Bought 2 pairs nobody wanted. Sold 1 at a loss. Net: –$142.\n\nAir fryer recipes on TikTok - Posted daily for a month. Got 3k views total. One dude commented \"mid.\" Earned $0.\n\nDigital planners - Spent $70 on \"premium fonts.\" Sold 0. My cousin downloaded the sample for free and never said thanks.\n\nSurvey apps - 40 minutes for $1.20. Deleted all of them out of self-respect.\n\n**What actually paid (tiny but real):**\n\nPhone repair gigs - Replaced cracked screens. Charged $40–$60 each. Made \\~$260 after buying tools.\n\nCleaning two Airbnbs - Found on Facebook groups. $55 per clean, did 5 in two months. Total: $275 and a sore back.\n\nTask Monkey (Chrome extension) - Tried it during Prime Day. Got $82 back from random Amazon price drops with zero effort. Literally the closest thing to \"passive\" I touched.\n\n5 months in, I don't trust the \"make money in your sleep\" people.\n\nEverything that paid required sweat, messages, or driving across town.\n\nThe \"passive\" stuff? Mostly vibes and disappointment.\n\nIf you've found something real that isn't a course, a flip, I'm listening.",

No overnight success or make money in your sleep, though that can happen but, not without a lot of work and time first, usually. \n\nDigital products with a faceless Instagram made me over $1K my first week - not passive. You post on IG, people buy your products. It's a full business but, very flexible and you work when you want. It's getting paid to post on social media and chat with people sometimes.\n\nUGC is not passive but, you can make $50 to $250 per video for brands. There's a sub here that posts gigs.

I understand they could just be diversifying their income but why aren't you doing more of what you claim works? Why are you on YouTube telling people how to be your competitors? It feeling like the new mlm where people get into it and when it doesn't pay as well as they thought, they try to get other people on board.\n\nIs it just me who thinks that if I found a way to make easy (or at least passive) income, I wouldn't be telling everyone how to get a piece of that pie?",

It could be a passive income if you have a trusted manager you pay to oversee 20 vending machines while you’re still collecting a decent profit after expenses.\n\nSame thing applies for Airbnb cleanings, if you hire enough employees and managers to run it for you.\n\nAnother example is owning rental units.\n\nAnother example without owning actual business are owning stock and getting paid dividends, becoming an angel investor for someone with a great idea, silent investors, creating enough videos that generate views consistently.\n\nOnce you fully understand what passive income is and how to approach it, you can really take any endeavor and grow it to where you can step away and generate true passive income. Many endeavors require the business to be much larger to generate passive income so you don’t have to work again but you could still generate something small on the side if you want.",

At least they are out there if people search em I guess. \n\nI did surveys and because I’m such an honest person I felt bad lying about anything that was too personal and usually u waste ur time on them just for them to say nah we don’t want you. No money for u. So dang frustrating 😭 \n\nThe cans and bottles recycling is barely helping coz i can’t afford to buy many anyway. Had to switch to using Powerade powder as it is. \n\nThe most passive thing I do tho is using American Express points for credit on my bill. So I run every single daily expense for the household thru the card. Put the cash into an account and pay when I need to. This gives me a couple cents of interest sometimes and every 10,000 points = $50. I’m super surprised I even got approved but it’s only the Essentials card. \n\nMOST passive things either need a lot of initial brain power, money or they are just over saturated with people doing the same.",

          "body": "I've been making a couple hundred each month just by looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than the cost. It's called bonus arbitrage. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

Every business needs content for Instagram and TikTok, but most don’t know how to make it or don’t have time. You can create these videos using stock footage, simple templates, and AI voice tools. The hardest part used to be the voiceover, but that is solved easily now with modern tools. A few local clients paying for monthly content bundles can become steady income.\n\nBoth of these are quiet, low competition, and way more profitable than the apps and trends people usually recommend.\n\nI write about all these methods in my blog post.

Don't know how this will work, but it's an idea.\n\nIn 2018, I helped do a journalism piece on modern slavery  for the show Ecologic on 99.5 WBAI Radio, NYC. I was researching for slavery in the palm oil industry, their enslavement  of people and environmental degradation from the plantations, but when you research,  you find other stuff. One of them was fake designer bags. They force slaves to make the bags with lead. The buyer slowly dies of lead poisoning because the dust is either inhaled,  absorbed through skin, or if you're a nail biter, through the mouth. The slaves can be children of hide and seek age. I had nightmares doing this story.\n\nSo, keeping stuff out of the landfill,  making designer goods cheap enough to compete with fakes, while helping the slaves and giving me pocket money  might be the answer to solve a horrific problem. Still learning how to do this , but there are bag flippers out there making a living. Might as well try.",

          "body": "One thing I've been doing is bonus arbitrage, which can probably make you a couple hundred each month. Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

          "body": "I've been making a couple hundred each month just by looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than the cost. It's called bonus arbitrage. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

          "body": "I've been making a couple hundred each month just by looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than the cost. It's called bonus arbitrage. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

You have to commit yourself against any kind of fun for a while, but eventually your mind changes and it gets easier.\n\nYou’ll see friends going to bars, clubs, fun, and festivals. Some won’t talk with you anymore because you can’t do what they are. you’ll miss trips, you won’t take vacation, you’ll not get kids important to you the exact thing you wanted. You’ll be embarrassed. You’ll have to eat the free lunch anytime it’s available. You’ll need to not eat out, clip coupons, make your own coffee, not get a convenient snack at the gas station. You have to be a little hungry til you’re home. Going somewhere for fun? It’s the park with your feet.\n\nYou’ll do this for a minimum of three years, and the rest of the world will be having a WAY better time.\n\nYear one starts slow. Agonizing. It’s $10 to a broker account a week. Maybe $50 if things went alright. Your friends are hitting you up but you’re not going. Month goes by. You’re suddenly craving your favorite Chinese spot, and damn you have $200 extra, can’t you slide some over? NO. You can’t. Because you looked up some monthly dividend-payers and that $200 is about to pay you $5. That Amazon movie you want to see is $4.99, perfect! FUCK NO.\n\nYou’re 6 months in, damn, you were able to save a grand, where did that come from? You can afford a little splurge, right? There’s a charter that’s $180 to take you fishing and you just got paid - why don’t you go? Well now your $5 dividend-paying stock that cost you $200 had some NAV erosion and it’s $185. You make the painful smart choice to buy another. Single. Stock. Because now you’re making another whole $5 this month and it was $15 off.\n\nAbout this point you realize how expensive it is to actually buy your own time back. So you start running the numbers. You want $10/hr? Congrats you have now accumulated around $1400 in your $5 dividend-paying account spread across 7 total stocks. You have bought yourself 3.5 hours of work at $10/hr.\n\nYou realize no one can live on $10/hr without support, and life really wants around $25-30.\n\nYou really only gained an hour, it’s November. Christmas is coming, last Christmas sucked, you have over a grand, your partner is upset you’re not living like everyone else… but you *did* get an extra hour of work out of every month.\n\nNext year, you try harder, you get a second job. You diversify. You find there are weekly payers. You get them for a quick dopamine hit. it’s good for a bit to see that cash every week. Then someone on TV says something they don’t mean and your portfolio tumbles, you stopped your steady $5/month payer and had it all in weekly payers, you got greedy and didn’t know what you were buying, so you cash out, taking a little tax hit and bruising your ego. You’re kicking yourself, you don’t want to tell your partner you just set yourself back two months.\n\nJust then, new tech! Your weeklies raise and you’re already out. You want back but you know better, and two weeks later, you were glad you didn’t buy the news, it’s crashed even lower.\n\nYou feel smart, but you couldn’t have really known though. You’re more uncertain, your money is in the hands of billionaires through your broker. They don’t give a shit about you. They could wipe your account at any time (it’s in the terms but you didn’t read them at first).\n\nYou start to realize you need custody, that is your money. You learn about Direct Registration, where shares are ACTUALLY held in your name - under your SSN, not a broker. We’re rolling up on the third year here….\n\nYou now own your shares. The company you bought them from issues you a check now for the dividends, or reinvests it. You’re making steady gains, you’re buying dips, you’re making a hundred extra a month. You bought 3-4 hours of your time back and it only took 3 years! \n\nNow everything looks different. You don’t go to the weed shop and get two cartridges, you don’t smoke at all because that’s cutting into paying yourself faster. You’ve actually dropped a few habits because they were expensive.\n\nAll your friends are broke and complaining, you’re just quiet because you stacked - but you’re still not done… because in just a few months you’re on your way to $185 a month in dividends, which you’re putting right towards those nice stocks that always hang around $180, and FINALLY you’re getting some compounding.\n\nAnd you still can’t spend that because God only knows what’s around the corner.\n\nIt can be done, it’s FUCKING HARD.\n\nI don’t do much in stocks anymore, I took a good chunk of what I made (except long term plays) and mine Bitcoin now, but you didn’t want promotion, so there’s a stock story.",

Neither of us actually knew how to buy stocks or bonds so I went on YouTube and did my research.

It's a form of arbitrage, and it can make you an extra couple hundred each month. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives those offers higher, creating more opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how it works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them.

If you write a book then you’re a writer.

Most online income streams require some level of updating just to stay relevant because the internet moves fast and competition is nonstop. You can build systems that feels passive, like digital products, affiliate links, or automated funnels, but they still need tweaks to keep performing. The truth is most “passive income” is really front-loaded work with occasional maintenance, not total hands-off money. It’s possible, but definitely closer to semi-active for most people.",

Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

          "body": "You can try bonus arbitrage, which can probably make you a couple hundred each month. Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

I do invest aswell which is the only thing seeming to work at all, I have been making a snowball portfolio that pays me around $400 a year but still not where i want to be.",

          "body": "You can try bonus arbitrage, which can probably make you a couple hundred each month. Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

Tools like AutoDS automate most of the work, so this fits well with school and your schedule. Your car isn’t needed for this one, and 1k is more than enough to start.\n\nAnother path is building a faceless YouTube channel. You never have to show your face. You can use stock footage, simple editing, and AI voiceover tools. The voiceover used to be the hardest part, but AI solves that easily. Once a few videos start getting views, a channel can earn from ads and affiliate links for months or years. With Miami as your environment, you can even make local niche content if you want.\n\nYou can also make short marketing videos for small businesses. Restaurants, barbershops, gyms, car detailers, landscape services, even small online brands all need short videos for TikTok and Instagram. You can make these from home using stock clips and AI voice tools. Go in person and offer a small content bundle. Your car makes this easier because you can visit businesses and build relationships.\n\nThese are all things that can grow, pay more over time, and give you real skills instead of doing random low paying gigs.\n\nI cover all these methods in my blog.

You could try side hustles or second jobs to grow that portfolio but it will take many years.",

I personally have 4 savings set out for me. \nSavings 1 - 6 months expenses. Eg. Car payments, rent, phone bills, medical aid, etc. This is there to save in any situation where I get fired or retrenched. \nSavings 2 - short term goals. Eg. I just started adding to this monthly. No real goal, just kept saving here. \nSavings 3 - emergency savings. In any situation you could get to a point where you need to pay for something that you can’t afford cash. \nSavings 4 - long term goals. Eg. Marriage, home loan, car loan, etc. where it will be big amounts. \n\nUse these to set yourself up. You’re young, you can do it. \n\nIf you want side hustles, monitor TikTok trends and see how many people are doing it. I have many side hustles that do quite well. I print and edit photos on the side, I have a instax rental and I trade forex on the side. Makes me about $500 per month excluding my trading profits.",

          "body": "Selling digital products is a solid option. You can turn your editing skills into templates, presets, overlays, transitions, or project files and sell them on Gumroad or Etsy. You make the product once and it can sell again and again without you doing more work.\n\nPrint on demand is another idea worth trying. You can design simple graphics for shirts, posters, or notebooks, upload them to a site like Printful, and connect it to Etsy. You don’t buy inventory and everything is handled for you.\n\nAffiliate marketing works well if you enjoy recommending tools or gear. You earn a commission when someone buys through your link. Pairing this with a small blog or YouTube channel helps it grow steadily over time.\n\nSince you already edit videos, one of the best things you can do right now is **create short marketing videos for small businesses**. With stock footage and AI voice tools, you can make clean videos without filming or recording anything yourself. The hardest part used to be the voiceover, but AI solves that easily. Restaurants, gyms, salons, real estate agents, and online sellers all need simple Instagram and TikTok videos, and they pay well for monthly bundles.\n\nAnd with your existing editing experience, you’re in the perfect position to build a **faceless YouTube channel**. You can use AI voiceovers, stock footage, and your editing skills to produce high quality content fast. A channel can earn from ads, affiliate links, and digital products for months or years after a video is uploaded, which is the closest thing to true passive income.\n\nDropshipping on eBay is another path worth considering if you want something more hands off. You don’t need inventory, you only buy an item when it sells, and tools like AutoDS automate most of the work.\n\nAll of these are realistic, beginner friendly, and can fit into your school schedule.\n\nI explain all these methods in my blog.

If I were to be taken further with them also, is it the case that this would technically be self employment, in terms of tax etc, and have people had experience with this company/does this line of work offer decent enough wages, or would it need to be supplemented with other work?\n\nAny input anyone has would be appreciated ",

And that's on both sides, folks desperately looking for cheap labor since they can't afford professional services and need to get work done, as well as folks desperately looking for work, like yourself. A vast marketplace rife with desperation is always going to be a huge target for scammers. And that's also the logic behind it being pay-to-play, since scammers generally just want to scam you in order to get money without shelling out even so much as a penny in the process.

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I posted this in another subreddit and I got some heartwarming messages that it inspired them, so I'm going to share this with you, hopefully it can inspire some of you as well. (I don't have anything to sell, don't worry.)\n\nI’ve been doing Amazon KDP (Amazon's self publishing platform) since August of 2024, a little over a year now. It is possible to do it on the side, I didn't because I started with nothing. Literally. No money, living out of my car, and I needed to do something about my situation. I want to share my full experience scaling this from $0 to $150K revenue. The lessons I learned, and why I think KDP is nowhere near saturated as many claim.\n\nMy hope is that this post will give you value, motivation, and perspective, especially if you’re just starting out or feel stuck.\n\n# A Little Background\n\nI’ve always been into business, ever since i was a kid flipping Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh cards and other collectibles, plus video game currencies, items, accounts. Over the years I’ve tried everything: forex, stock trading, affiliate marketing, SEO blogs, dropshipping, customer acquisition/lead generation agency, CPA marketing, SMMA, POD, and of course KDP.\n\nJust to keep in mind, this is not my first time doing KDP. My first attempt was in 2019, but my account got banned in early 2020 for a few (frustrating) reasons:\n\n* I used a term, that a few months later got filled for trademark and Amazon flagged me, even tho the trademark was just pending and was rejected later.\n* Got hit with a “similar cover” strike ( I should have fought it, probably would have won. Not sure why I didn’t.)\n* Published a book called “Snarky Nurse Coloring Book” with the idea that the book was snarky (snarky quotes), not the nurse. Tt got reported by a brand called Snarky Nurse or something similar.\n\nAfter the third strike, Amazon didn’t let me appeal or explain myself, they kept sending the same generic response that the decision is final and nothing could be done.\n\nAfter all this I didn’t do anything, I got comfortable, had plenty in savings, some other life events happened during covid that I lost any motivation to do anything, until life forced me to start again.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nI’m not smart or special. Many people make much more with KDP than I do. But I’ve failed a lot, learned from my mistakes, and treated this like a real business. What I’ll share is what worked for me. Hopefully you’ll learn something useful from it and get some clarity on how you should approach this business if you decide to give it a shot.\n\n# Quick Stats:\n\n* Started: August 2024.\n* Books Published 148. (1 book every 3 days or so)\n* Total Revenue: \\~$150,000\n* Ad Spend: \\~$16,000\n* Employee Costs: \\~$24,000\n* Tools &amp; Subscriptions: \\~$2,500\n* TikTok Marketing Videos: \\~2,000\n* Profit (before tax): \\~100,000\n\nLast month, I made \\~$32,000 revenue, with \\~$10,000 in expenses.\n\n# Lessons, Tests &amp; Observations:\n\n1. **Quality vs. Quantity.** I’ve seen many YouTubers talk about focusing only on quality and to be honest I don’t fully agree. I started with quantity, not because I believed in mass publishing, but because I wanted data. I uploaded many somewhat decent quality books at first (most didn’t even hit 10 sales) and they helped me to identify which niches and formats had potential. Then I moved to more medium quality books, they took me 2-5 days each, in niches that showed potential and these confirmed the winners. I then outsourced even better versions and that’s where most of my revenue came from (excluding the unicorn). So it’s not quality or quantity, you need both to optimize your business.\n2. **Amazon ads.** I’m a numbers guy, I love data, tracking, testing everything. With amazon ads you obviously get more sales, but you also get an 20-30% bump in the organic sales. Sales boost your BSR, help you rank higher, which gets you more sales, more reviews, and all of this combined, a stronger foundation in the algorithm, making it more difficult for competitors to outrank you. So yes, ads are worth it, even beyond direct ROI. There’s another reason why I find ads even more important than getting sales. To be honest I didn’t even start them with the idea to make money from them directly. As I said, I love data, and amazon unfortunately shows you almost no valuable data at all. Running ads helps you a little bit as you can see the impressions you get, how many clicks you get and how many conversions, enough signal to see what’s working and what isn’t. It’s not ideal, but this is what we have to deal with when it comes to amazon.\n3. **Keywords.** Always use relevant keywords, leave fields if you don’t have anything relevant to add. I tested adding trending but not relevant keywords on a couple of books that had \\~20 sales a month each. Sales dropped to 4 and 6 the first month and 1 and 0 on the second month. Removing those irrelevant keywords didn’t restore the sales. Only running ads brought them back. Unrelated words hurt your relevance score, which can tank your book entirely\n4. **External ads.** I had some experimentation with meta ads, spend $600 and made \\~$450 above baseline over the next few months (sales doubled the month with the ads being run and slowly fell back to baseline). Still not enough data to fully judge, I’ll test this more, I need to spend at least $10,000 to have at least some opinion about this, and that’s what I’m going to do in the upcoming months.\n5. **A+ Content.** Almost always helps unless it’s really, really bad. I’ve tested many different layouts, worst ones had \\~10% increase in CVR, the best ones increased 80-150%, depending on the niche and design. Either way, it helps.\n6. **Cover Design (not just artsy, its psychology).** After niche selection, cover is the most important factor. People do judge a book by it’s cover If your design isn’t at least as good as top competitors in that niche, your book is gonna sink in the vast ocean that is Amazon. If you can afford it and your design skills aren’t great, I would suggest outsourcing covers to skilled designers. Still, do some of them yourself, to have a better understanding as not all of it is art, it’s more about the psychology of the customer, it is the pitch for your product. (Also the content of the book has to be good enough as well, because negative reviews can kill your book just as easily as bad cover, just a little slower).\n7. **Descriptions.** I’m not sure if I am just bad at writing them, but I never seen a big difference in CVR from it. The only thing that seems to matter in my experience is the formatting. The description still has to be informative and relevant to the book itself, but if it’s done in a big block of text it’s not gonna help. If it is formatted nicely, then I’ve seen 10-30% CVR improvements. The other thing that I’ve noticed is that having a relevant and informative description helps the book rank higher. It happened consistently enough to make me almost sure that Amazon’s algorithm rewards it.\n8. **Low Search Volume Niches (Small Margins Scale Big).** Pretty much every YouTube video I watched about KDP said to target niches that have high search volume of 1000+ at the minimum and ignore every one of them that get less. I often target niches other skip, even less than 500 searches per month. I care more about competitor strength and actual sales. If I feel I have a fighting chance against the competitor in that kind of niche, that has 100-200k BSR, then I’ll attack it. I get it, making books that are going to get 100-200 sales a month isn’t sexy, but over the year they make $1,200-$2,400, and ten, twenty, thirty, one hundred of these adds up to real income.\n9. **E-mail Lists.** These are great but I’ve only managed to make them work in two situations. In my unicorn niche, I built a list of 1,000+ via a variety of freebies. When I launched a supporting book with a release day discount, I emailed the list and got 200+ day one sales. I’m not saying that 20% of the email list converted, but even if 3-4% can create enough sales velocity to push the book up the rankings making it get even more sales and climb even higher up. Second, with my “client” brand (consumable books). We built the list by running promotional ads and in book freebies. After every weekly release, the email goes out and almost consistently gets 100 day one sales, some releases even get 200-300.\n10. **Short-Form Video Marketing.** One day I got bored and thought about trying out something new, I released a book in a very competitive niche(which means lot’s of interested people) and created a TikTok account to make videos for that book. After printing the book and recording a few videos, repurposing them, following trends, changing the hooks , etc., one video hit nearly 1m views. This led to over 2,000 sales in the first week after upload. Since then I’ve uploaded 250+ videos, hired other people to make videos for me and I’ve had a few other viral videos (not as bit as the original one tho).\n11. **Pricing.** Compete on the quality of your book rather than price, if your book is better than competitor’s, price it higher and position it as premium. Low price makes you look cheap, not “affordable”. The pricing is different depending on the niche and type of the book itself, so what I would recommend is to launch around the average competitor price, could be a little higher if you are confident in your book (that’s what I do), or price it just a little below the average. Monitor CVR, if it is solid, then increase the price by $1 and observe, if it gets too big of a hit, reverse the change if it doesn’t keep increasing the price. If the book ranks high, gets steady organic sales and reviews, push premium pricing.\n12. **99% of Gamblers Give Up Before They Hit it Big.** Okay, maybe not in gambling (please don’t). But in business? Mostly true. Most people give up right before they’ve learned enough both from theirs, and other people’s failures to make their business work. There’s plenty of money in almost every business. Imagine a gambler spinning the slots, after 30 failed spins, he hits jackpot. Business it’s similar, keep testing, keep learning, fail, tweak it, try again. Do that 30 times and on attempt 31 it suddenly looks like you “got lucky”(You didn’t. You just didn’t quit.) If you knew that you were 30 failures away from your dream, would you keep going?\n13. AI Tools as Assistants, Not Crutches Do not let AI do all the work for you. You won’t really learn what’s working and the quality will be subpar. People notice that the book was written by AI and leave negative reviews. Use it to brainstorm ideas, rough outlines, keyword ideas that you’re gonna validate, even sketch A+ layouts. Always double check the accuracy (AI likes to hallucinate) and IP. AI speeds you up, significantly, but it doesn’t do the job for you.\n14. **KDP plateau.** Plateaus do happen at every stage. I sat at a bit over $6,000 per month for a while, luckily for me it was a decent enough revenue to stay motivated. Some people, especially beginners, plateau at $0 per month, or they reach $500 in the first months, stall for a few months, assume “KDP is dead” and quit. It’s not. It’s just lag and learning. The move isn’t to quit, it’s to keep publishing and keep making small improvements. Eventually you’ll break out. Keep going, keep measuring, keep improving and then the compounding finally shows up.\n15. **Outsourcing and delegating.** All of this is going to depend on your budget and skill level. I hire people to go faster, not to disappear. I keep strategy, ads, research, final approval and hand off stuff like covers, interiors, basic edits, videos. I also do some books fully myself to keep improving and learning. At first you should do everything yourself, to learn as much as possible, to even know what to ask your employees to do, to be able to make SOPs for them. Eventually when you can no longer keep up with the amount of books you want to make, you start hiring. Track cost per title, have an idea on how fast the contractors work, how long it is going to take to make a book. Keep light P M Cadence, do weekly check-ins, have a QC checklist before anything goes live. Plan so that one person’s vacation doesn’t stall launches. Pay on time, give bonuses when earned, give specific feedback, promote your A-players.\n16. **Treat it like a real business and I mean REAL business.** KDP isn’t a lottery ticket, it’s a real publishing business. I budget, track unit economics and make decisions off numbers, not vibes. That means knowing your CTR/CVR, ACOS/TACOS, margin, payback time (how long till the book repays it’s investment), opportunity cost, LTV per title and more. Keep a simple P&amp;L, reinvest into ads, books, testing, learning. Write SOPs for contractors, kill or fix anything that doesn’t earn its shelf space. Manage your cashflow, plan for seasonality, keep runway for tests, don’t starve the winners. Be boringly safe on ToS/IP and make sure to set aside money for taxes. Real business = clear goals, clean and tight processes, consistent iteration.\n17. **You need action much more than you need information.** Most people don’t have a knowledge problem, they have a doing problem. You can binge every KDP video, read every post in KDP forums and still have $0 in royalties because you never uploaded anything. On top of that you’re gonna forget most of the stuff you watched either way if you do not try to implement it almost immediately. When and if you’ll start taking action, you’ll go back and start rewatching those videos again with context. Learn just enough to take action. By taking action you’ll learn the most. Half baked action beats perfect research because market teaches faster than any tutorial. Most importantly be consistent with your action, and consistently improve with it.\n\n# Key Takeaways\n\nKDP is not oversaturated. People said that it was already “too late” back in 2019 when I first started, and they’ll say the same in 2030. The real difference is how you treat KDP. Treat it like a real business. Track data. Build Systems. Reinvest Profits. TEST RELENTLESSLY. Be consistent and improve every week. Stagnation is death, and even to maintain your level, you have to keep evolving because the competition is evolving. Plan your week. Every Sunday, I write down my tasks and deadlines. And I need to do them. No excuses. That habit alone kept me on track for 60-70 hours a week for over a year.\n\n# My Goals for the Future\n\nThis December my plan is to get to $100,000 - the coveted six figure month. I know it’s possible, because December sales can triple or quadruple.  \nBut my goals don’t stop here.\n\n**My next milestone for 2026:**  \n$1,000,000 in total revenue  \n$253k+ in December 2026 alone.  \nThe reason for that specific figure is that back in 2020 I spoke with someone who made $252K in December 2019 with a team consisting of her and her husband. I’m going to have a bigger team than that to try to hit this number, but let’s ignore that fact.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis year has been life-changing. I went from being broke and sleeping in my car to running a six figure publishing business. I don’t think that this was luck. It was consistency, constant improvement, and treating KDP like the serious business it is. If you’re reading this and were thinking about quitting. DON’T. Keep going, test things, learn from your data, stay disciplined. Do not think “What if it’s not going work out? What if I fail?”. Think “What if everything does work out?”.",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone.  \nI am not much of a Redditor, but I'm struggling now and decided to ask/share here to get tome thoughts and insights, maybe.\n\nA few months ago, I lost my job and just then talking to my friend I learnt the details of her work which is link building. I did some reading and found the concept of SEO very intriguing, as it is basically you trying to figure out the rules by which Google plays and then succeed at the game (at least how I see it so far). The organic aspect of it seems very interesting to me.\n\nI must say I am from a small country where SEO is not very developed, but we have some local SEO agencies and companies that have SEO departments, both of which accept interns regularly. So I decided to give it my time and attention and learn at least the basics and try to get into the field.\n\nThe basics of SEO were pretty easy to understand. My friend introduced me to everything (big thanks to her!) and I even started helping her (unofficially) with her job a bit to get some hands-on experience in email outreach. We managed to build something around 10 links in a month with my help, and I am very proud of that, honestly.\n\nRecently I have also completed a fill SEO course which was very easy to follow and understand. It felt somewhat reassuring, seeing stuff I already knew from what my friend had taught me included in the course. I am now waiting to see the results of my final exam on it.\n\nStarting from the last week, I have also been accepted for an internship. They gave the applicants an initial task, and apparently I did it well enough that I passed. Now, this is an internship for a link building position, and we're starting from the basics, but I can't wait to start doing more practical work.\n\nAll of this being said, I want to share that even though I have been saying that stuff feels easy to understand, it also feels very overwhelming. Every single little thing/term/tactic seems to lead to a bunch more new and complex to remember things. Having no real work experience, it is very hard for me to make sense of what is actually a commonplace thing to do and what is very situational and possibly even outdated.\n\nI try my best to listen to beginner-friendly podcasts and whatnot to get some sense of trust in my own knowledge and understanding of things. Most of the time, having no paid tools to use or having no actual work experience/environment with the theory/practice ratio being something like 90/10 it feels so overwhelming and too much at times to grasp.\n\nI would love to hear how you all started your journeys. Is it okay to feel this way? Am I overthinking it, and once/if I get a proper job in the field it will get easier with more experience? I think there are a lot of us newcomers here, and I would love to hear from you too. Do you have similar stuff going on for you? How do you go about it?",

I went down a pretty big rabbit hole reading Reddit threads, founders’ stories, complaints, success posts, everything I could find. The same pain points kept popping up over and over—on both sides.\n\nFrom the **merchant side**, I kept seeing things like:  \n• “Hard to know which affiliates actually drive incremental revenue.”  \n• “Coupon sites vacuum up commissions on sales we would’ve gotten anyway.”  \n• “Tracking breaks constantly or needs tons of dev work.”  \n• “Refunds and cancellations are a nightmare to reconcile.”  \n• “Fraud and low-quality affiliates make the whole thing feel sketchy.”\n\nFrom the **affiliate side**, it was stuff like:  \n• “Opaque tracking… feels like I’m guessing half the time.”  \n• “Platforms don’t keep creators updated on deals or new offers.”  \n• “Most tools are made for big creators, not smaller ones.”  \n• “Delayed payouts or unclear earnings.”  \n• “Zero support… just drive traffic and hope for the best.”\n\nAfter reading all this, I started wondering:  \n**What would a super simple, drop-in affiliate system look like if it was built in 2025 from scratch?**\n\nSomething like:\n\n* One script added to the site\n* Auto-tracking of clicks + purchases\n* Clear attribution\n* Dead simple dashboard\n* AI-powered fraud detection and refund reconciliation\n* Tools that help creators actually convert, not just blast links\n\nNo huge setup, no custom backend, no clunky legacy stuff.\n\nRight now, I’ve only built a small landing page and waitlist form just to see if there’s real interest before I invest months into this. Absolutely nothing is live and I have no product to sell. Just trying to validate the idea.\n\n**Here’s the prototype landing page if anyone wants to take a look or join the waitlist:**  \n[https://affiliate-platform-e0416.web.app/](https://affiliate-platform-e0416.web.app/)\n\n(I only include this because some subs require you to show what you’re working on.

Know the value you create.\n\n\n\nI realized the bot wasn’t just “answering questions.” It was giving my dad time back. Every minute the bot handled a question was a minute he didn’t have to leave the oven or stop prepping orders. Time saved is value.\n\n\n\n3. Think long term, not one-time.\n\n\n\nInstead of thinking, “let me just build this once,” I realized how useful it would be to refine it over time, improving responses, adding new features, updating menu items, logging common questions, etc. \n\n  \n\n\n4. Learn from others\n\n\n\nMaking a chatbot that actually works is hard. I watched tutorials, learned from devs, etc. That saved me from so much time. There’s always someone who already solved the problem you’re facing.\n\n\n\nYou can build a lot of useful things with agents and chatbots, even for small businesses like my dad’s.\n\n",

But some people are capable, they just never built the habits, the patience, or the mindset to survive the tough parts.

In Lebanon, for example, we have a different mindset. It’s actually a bit embarrassing to say you are an employee. Especially if you are older. Why? Because an employee in Lebanon is either working for a wealthy family, or the government. And so people just assume he or she ‘serves’. (Of course; judges and generals are highly respected.) \n\nAnd how about employment in Eastern Europe? There it is shameful not to work. And people don’t understand the idea of being an independent businessman. I own cash flowing assets in Eastern Europe and I build to sell in Lebanon. So I think I’m doing fine. And yet, people in Eastern Europe still think that I am an unemployed person who doesn’t contribute to their economy 😂 \n\nAnyway, I agree with you. Not everyone should be a businessman or businesswoman. But I think it’s much more thrilling, exciting, and rewarding to be able to build your own business and pass it down to your children.

There is no such thing as a person that can't deal with uncertainty, managing money or that needs constant validation - there just are people that can't do that stuff RIGHT NOW, because that's where they are, who they believe they are and who they choose to be in the future.\n\nThe key is personal growth. It sounds cliche because so many wannabe coaches preach it, but it is true. Just imagine who you were as a child. There is very little of that person in you right now. You changed. The only difference is that most of those changes happen by accident, while the most necessary changes must happen by choice.\n\nOnce you decide to change, you have to act. If you want to learn how to deal with uncertainty, well, put yourself in risky situations. Put your money in small caps, buy cripto, start a side hustle. Assess where you fuck up and learn. If you want to learn how to manage money, well, save and try to manage money. Buy courses, read books on the subject. Assess where you fuck up and learn. If you crave external validation, go to therapy and put yourself in situations in which people doubt you. Assess where you fuck up and learn. Every failure in your journey will hurt - some of them will hurt a lot. Assess the pain, learn and move on.\n\nWhere people go wrong is that they listen to their ego and unsuccessful people, let fear take over their decision rationale, fail to take ownership and responsibility and develop a flawed thought process in which they try as hard as possible to seek comfort and avoid pain. That leads to stagnation, frustration and resentment.\n\nGrowth is in failure and pain. Success is what you attain after you become the person who withstood and rose above those challenges.\n\nIn case you are wondering, this isn't some coaching bullshit. I became a much bettern partner after my first wife divorced me, I went to therapy and owned my shit. I became a better professional after 10 years of service in a company that pushed me as far as I could go. I learned how to build a business after blowing up a failed venture and going bankrupt. It all hurt like fucking hell at the time. I went through depression, substance abuse and all that jazz. I had to decide to get better. Things only got better once I put myself in the driver seat of my own life. If I did it, anyone can. I'm just a random dude from a midsized city in a third world country. ",

I enjoy problem-solving. I'm bad at sales and marketing, trying to improve ASAP. I handle stress okay and I'm not bad at handling conflict. I'm reasonably disciplined with finances although I have made some poor investments.\n\nI have occasionally overly trusted some people and not listened enough to others. While I'm comfortable with disagreement, at times I've given people the benefit of the doubt for too long before calling them out on it.\n\nAnyway, one year in, I mostly enjoy it although there are times when I get stuck in a rut. Still not sure whether the company has a product-market fit. I am happy at least that I will have been able to give it a try.

You are so so so wrong though and I'll tell you why you need to quit making these post.\n\n99.9% of businesses in America are small businesses (less than 500 people). \n\n98% of businesses in America a have less than 100 people. \n\nGiven those numbers, a safe assumption is that well over 90% of businesses have LESS than 25 people. The point I'm getting at here is, the vast majority of businesses in America are what I call \"micro\" companies. Companies that are anywhere from 5-15+ employees.\n\nSo why is it like this? The reason is very simple. Every  business, is a bunch of micro business that you could do easier and easier. **No matter what skill you have, that you use at a company, is being used as a stand alone company somewhere else.** \n\nWhat do I mean by this? Fine, you have this horrible job at a car dealership. You are a receptionist. You hate it. You want something else. \n\n**Ever heard of Concentrix? They recently did 10 BILLION in revenue by answering phones.** You know there are people, working at companies now, answering phones for less than $15 an hour. \n\nCar dealerships, clean cars, fix cars, sell cars, sell parts. ALL things you can hire people to do for you. My friends company does very well with just a window tint/detail company. Is **he going to be the next Microsoft? Probably not. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE.** You just need to make enough money that you never have to stress about money again. \n\nEntrepreneurship is not brutal. I've never struggled because I planned and followed rules. If you don't have basic money skills, learn! The largest issue I see is people try to start too big. With too big of a vision. Lets vacuum some floors first. Lets clean some windows. Lets cut some grass. Your neighbor always complaining about how dirty the dog is? My friend Sara makes MONEY with her pet grooming company. \n\n**Most of all:**\n\nQuit telling people its hard.\n\nQuit telling people its stressful.\n\nQuit telling people they shouldn't.\n\nQuit telling people they can't do it because YOU couldn't do it. \n\nI HOPE someone on here looks at your post and says F that shit. I'm going to go out, start a business and change the way things are. I don't care if you open the 9000th pizza restaurant in your city/town. Get out there and DO it and don't let anyone else tell you that you can't or shouldn't.",

They operate with almost no visibility in the tech world, yet they’ve become one of Elon Musk’s biggest financial backers.\n\nWhat shocked me first was how small they are.\n\nVy runs with only four core investors and roughly twenty people across California, London and Dubai. Even with a team that small, they **manage around fifteen billion dollars and have delivered about twenty-eight per cent annual returns for ten years.**\n\nThe second surprising thing is how concentrated they are. Instead of spraying money across dozens of startups, they built their entire identity around backing Musk early and sticking with him for the long haul.\n\nSome of their biggest moves include:\n\n* Investing in SpaceX when it was valued at $15B (it’s now close to $400B)\n* Putting $700M into the Twitter acquisition\n* Taking large positions in Neuralink and xAI\n\nThere are estimates that more than half of Vy’s portfolio is now tied to companies Musk runs.\n\nThe final thing that stood out is how they think about building a firm. They aren’t trying to scale into a giant institution. They actually told their LPs recently that they won’t raise outside money anymore. After compounding billions, they want to invest their own capital instead, which is extremely rare in venture.\n\nAnd they’re not only focused on the US. They backed companies like Zomato and Urban Company in India, along with firms like Upgrade, Cerebras and Coalition.\n\nWhen you put it all together, Vy feels less like a traditional VC fund and more like a tight, high-trust investment group built around long-term conviction instead of chasing trends. Small team, deep focus, long holding periods and quiet execution.\n\nPretty unusual in today’s tech investment world.",

That's very different from the VC culture of \"growth at all costs,\" where branding is more important than discipline.  \n  \nOf course, the risk is that everyone will focus on one founder.

Their focus strategy and long-term commitment to Musk-led businesses rather than chasing fads are what really stand out. The majority of VCs claim to be patient, but they quickly change their minds to appease LPs. Vy's early support of SpaceX, $700 million investment in Twitter/X, and increased focus on Neuralink and xAI demonstrate a degree of alignment that is uncommon.

      "selftext": "I started freelancing as a photographer in Austin last month and realized having a proper site is way more important than I thought since some of the commercial artists I know have websites. Word of mouth isn't cutting it for me . Spent hours googling \"small business designers” (forgot to include WEB , smh).. but reviews are all over the place it seems. Did anyone else have this problem when they were first getting set up? How did you finally decide which one to use?\n\nmaestrosites looks interesting but its trustpilot barely has any reviews. How do small business owners typically decide which web designer to use?",

To promote your website put some money into Facebook and TikTok adverts (since you're photographer having content should be easy). See where it goes from there.\n\nIf you get business coming in, then consider hiring someone to improve the SEO and marketing aspect of your website (still would not spend money on designers, as your website is likely just a simple landing page given your business).\n\n\\*edit: misspelled one of the names",

I probably spent about 20 hours getting everything setup, the majority of which was me trying to figure out how to write about myself and selecting the right set of photos to showcase my work.

      "selftext": "I came across a post on Reddit from a founder who raised 18 million over 12 years building his company. Now he owns less than 15 percent, but the company is valued close to 170 million. So that makes his share worth about 25 million on paper.\n\nBut he is not even close to happy. Investors have all sorts of rights now. He says they went behind his back more than once. He feels like they kind of pushed him out.\n\nFrom what I can tell, investors decide who stays or goes on the management team. They skip all emotion and just say they trust the system, not him. Reading between the lines, it sounds like they want him out, but they are not buying his shares, so he cannot leave.\n\nHe is stuck inside a company he started. It honestly sounds brutal. Almost like he never really learned how venture works until it was too late.\n\nStories like this remind me why I am bootstrapping my own project. No outside pressure, no board calls, no one ready to pull the rug out. I get to actually enjoy what I am building, set my own pace, and keep control. Sometimes I wonder if more founders would choose this way if they heard about the real tradeoffs up front.\n\nP.S. For those who’ve asked me in DMs, my project is called IGScraping.",

Customer support basically said \"yeah that happens.\" I was paying $1,250/month for a 50% accuracy rate. Insane.\n\nSo in February I got fed up and spent a weekend learning Python. Built a scraper that:\n- Finds .de domains in my target niches\n- Extracts emails from their contact pages (Impressum in Germany - legally required contact info)\n- Validates them before I even send an email\n\nRan it last month on ~2,500 dental practice websites:\n- Got 4,800+ emails \n- Bounce rate when I sent: 4.7% (vs the 50% I was getting before)\n- Cost: $43 in API fees + $12 AWS hosting\n\nI'm not trying to sell anything here. Just wanted to share because if you're paying for lead databases and getting garbage results like I was, you might want to look into building your own.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone's curious about the technical side.\n",

Competitors tutors get paid only about 25% of what the parents/student pay for their lessons, while my tutors get about 55%. \n\nFor more context, I pay them 50% above the average hourly wage in my country. Most of my tutors are university students, so having full flexibility over their time and this high of a pay while working from home is amazing.\n\nBecause of that, even my competitors tutors are applying for a position at my company\nOut of what I have left after I pay them, I need to pay for everything else: marketing, accounting, software... you know the drill. I have barely enough for myself. \n\nI also teach my own student. They pay me 2-3x what I pay my own tutors. From the money I earn, I pay my rent, most basic necessities (phone, internet, gym), and everything else goes back into my business, so basically I am not earning anything from my business (I put more in than I get out) - even though I work pretty much all day every day (only had one day off since august)\n\nI also try to treat my tutors the best I can - I often ask them if there is anything they need, such as dealing with a bad student, stress, time management, or new features in our internal system, which I am also developing on my own.\n\nI can objectively say that I treat and compensate my tutors way better than they would be treated if they worked for our competitors. But I still have the feeling that I am exploiting them for my own profit (even though they make more money out of my business than I do)\n\nHas anyone experienced anything similar? Is this guilt just a product of anticapitalistic propaganda?",

Finding clients, admin, etc is work, and it's work you clearly aren't compensating yourself for. It might be you're trying to outbid the other firms on wages when it's a competitive market, and if so, you're going to fail. If you don't want to reduce wages, figure out how to do the rest more efficiently. Otherwise you're going to keep losing money.\n\n\n&gt; Is this guilt just a product of anticapitalistic propaganda?\n\n\nFrom the language you use, probably. The labor theory of value, and any theory of \"objective\" value, is bullshit. People trade because they value the thing in question (an hour of work, a loaf of bread, etc) differently to each other -- would you trade one $5 bill with me for another?\n\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying in general that people should just be Ferengi -- some people need to be told to treat their employees better, but [you aren't one of those people](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/09/all-debates-are-bravery-debates/) and need to hear the opposite.",

The ones who aren’t happy are the anonymous throngs who say your action doesn’t live up to the standards of their nothing.  And you need to learn that their opinion is worth the same as their contribution: zero.\n\nIt’s not even an entrepreneurship problem. It’s a pessimism problem. Social media is so focused on making people passive and miserable that it feels wrong to actually do something and be happy. But that makes no sense. So take care of yourself, make honest agreements with the people you interact with, and fuck the haters.",

Three things I learned while running my own business that might help you:\n\n-\n1. You have to prioritise profit at some level; you need profit to invest in better software, staff, hardware, marketing, secure communication, data protection and on and on and on. Profit does not automatically equal exploitation. If you don't make money on top of your expenses you will not be able to grow efficiently, and efficient growth gives your employees more and improved resources, supports and non-monetary gains (gym memberships that are a tax write off for the business etc).\n\n\n2. Pay people to do things that they’re good at (this extends to software as well). Don’t waste your time being a bookkeeper with a spreadsheet when there is software or people that can do it quicker, cheaper and with their full focus. This applies to marketing, infrastructure, everything. At the start you have to do everything yourself but don’t make that period last any longer than it has to. \n\n\n3. You need to learn to look after yourself - you're current workload is unsustainable and will lead to health problems, and eventually burnout. I say this based on the fact I worked in a very similar way to you for most of my adult life (and doubly so for the 10 years I ran my business) until at 33 my brain and body decided enough was enough. I went from relatively healthy to now using a walker and being legally disabled. How will your staff be better off if you're not there. *Necessary disclaimer that my story isn’t your story, you are not me so what happened to me is indicative of what could happen to you - however there is plenty of evidence talking about the damage overworking does to our brain and body long term.*\n\n-\nYou're actually helping more than just your staff, you’re forcing your competitors to improve their conditions to retain good talent.

In my opinion id say keep doing what you do. maybe pay a little less and keep more while expanding the business. and thats exactly how a business owner should think. not a boss but someone who is willingly to sacrifice their own wants for others needs while building the community themselves and the people that work for them growing. these people will never grow because they care so much about themselves and only themselves that they cant see the cracks and leaks that’ll eventually wear and tear at their so called “businesses”.\n\nOriginal Poster, lol id say you just keep doin what your doing and if they get ungrateful take more from their pay n keep it just above how much the market usually pays them. people are complicated, too much of a good thing eventually gets old. do whatever you want as long as your happy. but look at the long terms.",

This is exactly how I want to start my business, by paying people a livable wage, not just a competitive wage. \nYou may be \"exploiting their work for profit\" but in reality you need to at it as you are offering them a path that didnt exist prior. You are better all their lives. It is a mutualism relationship, where both parties ar benefitting. \nI have in my business model, when im ready to hire employees, to also pay them above market value. This allows you to select the best candidates, have employees that stick around longer, and employees who may care more seeing as they are paid fairly. \nToo many corporations are fixed on paying the least possible amount they can while taking the profits all the  themselves. I believe in rewarding the owner(s) but also sharing those profits as well. \nGood luck to your business, it sounds like its working and growing.

Meaning, if you hired someone to do what you do, how much would you pay them.\n\nAfter a series of bad bosses and micro managers for 15 years, I ventured out and started my own accounting firm focusing on bookkeeping and controller level services. My business model is I don't outsource overseas. Could my margins be better if I do, sure... but that's not my model.\n\nI also make sure my team has all the greatest and latest software to do their job well even though thatz an extra $6k a year in software expenses, and I try to pay fairly. Do I go above and beyond what other bosses do, probably. But I also have a high employee retention rate. That is important.\n\nAs I've been scaling, I've been working less in the business and clients and more on the business by networking and focusing on client relations.\n\nPlease don't feel guilty, sounds like you are a great boss, what's important is you actually write out your income and expenses per month, see your bottom line and don't forget yourself. You deserve to be paid too.\n\nYou can be a for profit business and not feel like you are exploiting your employees. The fact that you're paying them above market value tells me you're not. \n\nIgnore the negative comments. My biggest suggestion is surround yourself with other entrepreneurs and have coffee dates with them pick each other's brains, learn from each other.\n\nI do that once a month and its quite helpful and you feel supported by others who are in the trenches like you. \n\nWay better advice than what's out here on reddit most of the time.",

I'm sure they would rather you exploit them than anyone else. \n\nHowever if you want an answer that says \"no you're not exploiting them\" it sounds like at the core of it you operate basically as a platform for them.

This post resonates because nobody tells you that entrepreneurship doesn't just test your business skills - it strips you down to your raw humanity.\n\nWhen our biggest client canceled a $400K order overnight in 2022, I didn't just lose revenue. I lost my ability to pay 59 workers who depended on me. I spent three nights sleeping on the factory floor because I was too ashamed to face my family. The 'boss' everyone saw during daytime video calls was a shell - inside, I was a 39-year-old man who hadn't eaten properly in weeks, wondering if I should just close the doors and get a real job.\n\nHere's what entrepreneurship actually is: it's looking your seamstress in the eyes when you can't pay her on time and explaining why. It's hand-delivering finished goods on your motorcycle at 2AM because the shipping company failed you. It's learning that your 'passion for fashion' means nothing when a client demands you redo 500 dresses three days before Christmas.\n\nI thought being an entrepreneur meant creative freedom. What it actually means is becoming the human safety net for everyone else's problems. The workers who need salaries, the clients who need deadlines met, the suppliers who need payments. Your personal anxiety becomes a luxury you can't afford.\n\nBut here's the unexpected gift: that confrontation forged me into someone I never knew I could be. Two years later, we survived. We now work with 15 international brands, and I've learned to build systems that protect both my team and my sanity. I take Sundays completely off - no emails, no calls - because I finally understand that sustainable businesses are built by sustainable humans.\n\nThe freedom isn't in being your own boss. The real freedom is knowing your breaking point and having the courage to build guardrails before you reach it. To everyone considering entrepreneurship: ask yourself not 'What's my business plan?' but 'Who will I become when everything falls apart?' That's the question nobody prepares you for.",

At least your old boss went home at 5pm.\n\nThe \"freedom\" narrative is bullshit. You don't get freedom - you get responsibility for everything. When the website crashes at 2am, guess who's fixing it? When a client doesn't pay, guess who's chasing them down? When you're sick, guess who's still working?\n\nBut here's what really separates the real entrepreneurs from the dreamers: Real entrepreneurs can't NOT do it. They're not choosing entrepreneurship because it's easier or more glamorous. They're choosing it because working for someone else feels like wearing shoes that are three sizes too small.\n\nIf you can be happy as an employee, be an employee. Get good at it, negotiate better pay, and invest wisely.

          "body": "You are in a great spot at eighteen because you are asking the right questions before the mistakes pile up. Most people chase “big ideas” and skip the basics. The basics are what actually build a business. If I were mentoring someone starting from zero, I would start with simple habits, not fancy books. Learn how to show up on time. Learn how to communicate clearly. Learn how to listen more than you talk. Learn how money moves through a business. These are the things that matter long before strategy.\n\nFor understanding markets and business models, start with real businesses around you, not theory. Look at a local car wash, a cleaning service, a lawn company, a small shop. Ask yourself how they make money, where the money leaks, and what makes customers come back. You learn more from studying simple companies than you will from reading big corporate stories. Once you get that foundation, books like “The E Myth” and “Company of One” make a lot more sense.\n\nFor mindset, the biggest skill at your age is patience. You avoid dumb mistakes by not rushing into trends, not borrowing too much too fast, and not building something no one asked for. Learn to test ideas in tiny ways. Offer something small, see who cares, and learn from the response. That habit will save you years of wasted time.\n\nIf you want to build problem solving, do hard things on purpose. Work in customer service. Work in sales. Take jobs where real people expect real results. It teaches you how people think, how they react, and what they actually value. That knowledge is gold in business.\n\nAnd if you ever want another perspective as you move forward, I spend a lot of time helping young people understand simple franchise paths and small business ownership. It gives them a clear way to learn how businesses work without having to guess at every step. If you ever want a breakdown of what that looks like, I am happy to share it.",

You don't have to incorporate all of the feedback, but at least hear people out because the right advice can make a huge difference.\n\n\\- When you do make mistakes, be kind to yourself. it is part of the journey, and building a business is all about learning and growing as a person.\n\nI could go on, but I feel that these are enough to put you in the right headspace.",

The biggest thing I'd tell my younger self is to get around other entrepreneurs as fast as possible. Books are great but watching how real founders think and operate teaches you way more. I joined a few startup accelerators and investor communities early on, and the mindset shift from being around those people was huge.\n\n\\- Zero to One by Peter Thiel - short, practical, makes you think differently about competition\n\n\\- Find local startup meetups or online communities where founders hang out - the conversations alone will teach you more than most courses\n\n\\- Start something small NOW, even if it fails - you learn 10x faster by doing than reading",

I'm the type who competes with Elon Musk on boldness, Trump on deal-making, and Bezos on long-term vision.\nWhat I'm about to tell you isn't just advice. It's the exact roadmap that, if you follow it at 18, will make you a millionaire before 25 and a billionaire before 40, inshallah.\nFirst things first: Fix your brain before you fix your bank account\nThe most important book you'll ever read in your life (not exaggerating):\n\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" by Robert Kiyosaki\nThis isn't a money book. This is a book that completely rewires how you think about money. Read it 3 times in your first year.\nSecond most important:\n\"The Psychology of Money\" by Morgan Housel\nThis will explain why people smarter than you go broke, and why average people die as the richest guy in the cemetery.\nThird (the one that will make you understand markets from the inside):\n\"Zero to One\" by Peter Thiel\nThis is the book Elon Musk himself says influenced him the most. It'll teach you how to build something nobody has ever done instead of competing in a crowded market.\nThe books that will actually make you dangerous (read them in this order):\nShoe Dog by Phil Knight (founder of Nike) → Story of a guy who started with $50 and sold the company for $30 billion.\nThe Lean Startup by Eric Ries → Will save you millions in stupid mistakes.\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie (original 1936 version) → The single most important skill in business: how to make people like you and want to work with you.\nPrinciples by Ray Dalio → The biggest hedge fund manager in history teaches you how to build a machine-like thinking system.\nThe Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz → The only book that talks about the dark days every entrepreneur goes through that nobody posts about.\nBeginner mistakes that cost millions (never make these):\nDon't think a \"genius idea\" is what makes you rich → 99% of billionaires executed a normal idea extraordinarily well.\nNever work completely alone → Your first hire should be someone smarter than you at something.\nNever invest your money in something you don't understand 100% (crypto, meme stocks, NFTs, etc.).\nBiggest mistake of all: being scared of going broke. I lost 7 figures in 2011 and came back stronger. Failure is the real MBA.\nThe daily routine that puts you ahead of 99% of people:\nRead 30 pages every single day (no less).\nWrite down 3 business ideas every day (even if they're dumb).\nMeet one new person in business every week (even online).\nStart one small side project every month (even if it's with $100).\nThe single most important advice you'll ever hear:\n\"Start right now with something tiny and sell it any way you can.\"\nI started selling printed T-shirts with 500 Egyptian pounds in 2009. Now I own a factory that prints for the biggest brands in the Middle East.\nThe secret isn't the idea. The secret is that first customer who pays you real money.\nFirst project I want you to start TODAY (costs less than $100):\nOpen an Etsy or Amazon KDP account.\nUse AI (Midjourney + Canva) to design 10 motivational wall art prints.\nSell each for $5-10.\nThe first $1000 you ever earn will change how you see business forever.\nYouTube channels you should watch daily:\nAlex Hormozi (this guy literally gives away million-dollar strategies for free)\nCody Sanchez (how to buy small businesses and scale them)\nMy First Million (podcast + YouTube)\nGraham Stephan (real estate and money)\nFinal words from someone who's seen business from rock bottom to the top:\nBeing 18 is your biggest competitive advantage right now.\nElon was coding at 12.\nBezos started Amazon at 31 (meaning you still have 13 years just to train).\nTrump inherited money. You're going to build an empire bigger than his because you're starting from the ground.\nStart today.\nNot tomorrow.\nToday.",

And they are happier than ever before.\\]*\n\n**Objective**: So, **your main goal is to appear in front of the right audience. That is it!!!!**.   \n  \nThere are 1000s of people around the world desperately searching for products and services like yours. You have to showcase your services in front of them.. Simple!!\n\n**Methods**: To appear, you need to create content in the way your audience searches for it. \n\n\\- Do not create what you think is right. Think from your audience’s mind-\n\n  \nCreate only **valuable+unique+informative** content**.**\n\nContent means blogging, short videos, explanatory videos, and social media posts.\n\nYour 100 days goal must be like this:\n\n* 150 blogs, SEO optimized \\[800 to 1k words each\\]\n* 200 short videos\n* 50 explanatory videos\n* 300 answers/engagement on Q&amp;A forums\n* Promote all this content on more than 6 social media platforms\n* Comment and link on others posts and content on social media\n* Get ranked on Google's 1st page from at least 3 keywords\n* Submit your product/services on at least 50 directories\n\nKeep doing this for the next one 100 days and you will see a MIRACLE . Yes, trust me, your sales will skyrocket.\n\n**No need to burn your money on ads. Use these methods together and your inbox will be filled with inquiries and payment invoices.**\n\nThis is the only formula that works. The rest is noise. No hack or shortcut ever works.\n\n*Whatever you are expert in, sell it to others, your services or your products.*  \n*And if you do not have anything yet, you can create your own app and sell it to others. Use Build with Gemini or any other no code app platform. Although they are not as easy as they claim, you can still build a usable app in about 7 days.*\n\nI hope this helps........\n\nI have kept this post very short. If you are confused or not getting anything, feel free to ask. I would love to explain.\n\nThanks...",

My business is being crippled by a massive reserve hold from u/Square, and their support team has essentially confirmed they will do nothing.\n\nI run a double-sided marketplace supported by AI where customers pay after service is rendered, sometimes by check, but often through Square. Though we're growing rapidly, we're not yet profitable so this reserve holds a significant portion of our runway hostage.\n\nDespite having a ZERO chargeback rate across hundreds of customer payments they're currently holding $20,000 in reserve. I'm expecting this to balloon to more than $50,000 in the next few months.\n\nI've already spent hours with their account services team over the last week but was told the reserve policy applied won't be reviewed until February 2026 and that they have zero authority to escalate or override it. They even refused to provide contact details for anyone with authority, and told me it was just part of the process.\n\nTo me this is Square is essentially just telling us to deal with it. Extremely frustrated... unless I can find a way to deal with this, we'll move to another payment services provider (open to suggestion!)",

Therefore, your customers could now (or in the future) be providing poor quality services which could mean chargebacks which Square is ultimately on the hook for. Even though you mentioned your chargebacks are low, as Square can't confirm the exact products being delivered, they perceive themselves to be at risk.\n\nThe reason the money is being held for 3 months is that customers have a 3-4 month window from the point of payment to make a chargeback and therefore, Square wants to be 100% safe incase this happens. As each month goes by you should request a portion of the funds back assuming they have passed the 3 month threshold. It would probably help to bring in a legal professional to the email threads to encourage them.\n\nIn the future you need a payment provider who supports marketplace businesses so they can payout the funds to your customers (so they are liable for the chargebacks rather than you) and you receive a % payout based on this.\n\nGood luck.",

I have $500k in cash and I'm preapproved with the SBA and/or a private loan (backed with personal assets) of $1.5m.\n\nSo I would like to stay under $1.5m if possible, will go higher for the right deal.\n\nI have been using bizquest and bizbuysell pretty much every hour of of every day since I started.\n\nJust last week a good one was listed for $1m. I sent over an LOI within 24 hours for the full asking. The seller then said he has multiple pending offers and started to ghost me. So I emailed him back the very same day with an offer for $1.1m. No response from the seller. So I sent another offer for $1.2m and a 60 day close. No response. I finally get a response and I got outbid. Which is just insane to me. The business was listed, got multiple offers way over asking, and was under contract within 5 business days.\n\nThat has been my experience ever since I started. This isn't the first time I've lost out on a deal. It fact, it's the third time my LOIs have gone nowhere.\n\nSo I want to change up my strategy. Unstead of waiting for a listing to go live, I think I'm going to start cold calling instead. I made a google sheet drive of over 1,000 businesses in Texas in the industry I want to get in. I have their business name, website, phone, address, and email if I could find it online.\n\nI haven't done anything with this list so far. I'm thinking the best way to go about this is to just cold call and cold email (i also heard that writing hand written letters can work) every single business and see if one of them want to sell to me. It's probably going to take me a year to go through the list and that's fine, I'm patient.\n\nI also tried calling brokers to see if they would do the cold calling for me. They won't. From my impression, brokers only work with sellers and they don't like buyers (just my experience lol)\n\nAny advice or tips would be appreciated.",

Some might not want a meeting - but the more signs that you give them that you're serious, the more seriously they take you.\n\nIf you don't want to go that route - I'd do the calling of the list yourself. Relationships and trust matter a lot at this end of the market, their business may not be for sale to day, but things change.\n\nAn alternative would be to look at less desirable cities in Texas and start there. Places like Lubbock, Waco or Amarillo come to mind.\n\nFrom a website listing perspective, I've bought and sold several businesses, none of them have ever hit a website as 'For Sale', some have gotten posted as 'Sold' by the broker after the fact. I'm working on a several million $ deal right now that has never been publicly offered for sale and has three bidders - all of which have shown proof of funds and ability to close. Good businesses get inbound offers fairly regularly.",

We have clients who do 3-4 deals with us per year as individual buyers. This is primarily because you start to build real relationships with brokers, get insights into deals before they go live, and often just easier to do roll up strategies. But it takes time to get there.\n\nAnd I know I’m biased but please don’t try to do the Quality of Earnings yourself or go with a low-quality provider just because it’s a bit cheaper, especially if you’re using an SBA loan, as they carry a PG.

I currently manage partnerships with major companies like TikTok, Amplitude, and others, so I’m very comfortable with scaling visibility, forging strategic relationships, and understanding what platforms look for.\n\nWhat I’m hoping to do here is trade knowledge with other founders, support each other with intros, advice, or feedback, share what’s working (and what isn’t) in marketing, partnerships, and growth, and ultimately build a small circle of people who want to level up together.",

A potential client reached out last month saying she's a solo entrepreneur trying to launch her first product line but \"really struggling financially\" and could I please work with her at a reduced rate.\n\nI felt bad for her. We've all been there right? So I gave her 30% off my normal rate, brought my project fee down from $4500 to $3000. Told her I remember what it's like starting out and I wanted to help.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. I'm helping her evaluate supplier quotes and she casually mentions she's trying to decide between putting 45k or 60k into her first inventory order. Then she's talking about her \"backup funds\" in case the product doesn't perform well.\n\nI didn't say anything but later I'm thinking wait, if you have 60k liquid to drop on inventory plus backup funds, why were you crying poor about my consulting fee?\n\nSo I did something probably unethical. I looked her up. Her LLC is registered, public record. I found her personal LinkedIn. She's not some struggling entrepreneur. She sold a previous company two years ago. I can't find exact numbers but based on the acquisition announcement and her current lifestyle posts it wasn't small.\n\nShe straight up lied to me to get a discount.\n\nNow I'm sitting here feeling like a complete idiot. I gave her a discount because I thought I was helping someone bootstrap their dream. Turns out she was just negotiating and I fell for the sob story.\n\nPart of me wants to tell her I know and revise my rate back to normal for the remaining work. But we're halfway through the project and I already agreed to the price. Plus if she refers other clients to me that's probably worth more than the $1500 I'm losing here.\n\nBut I'm also pissed. I've turned down two other inquiries this month because I'm at capacity and I'm working with her at a discount while she's sitting on what looks like serious money.\n\nMy wife thinks I should just finish the project and never work with her again. My business partner thinks I should confront her because she disrespected my work and wasted my goodwill.\n\nHonestly I don't even know what the right move is here. I keep thinking about all the hours I'm putting in at a reduced rate while she probably thinks she played me perfectly. Maybe she did.\n\nI'm going to finish the project and chalk it up to a learning experience. On the bright side, at least the supplier research part has gotten easier since I started using SourceReady for vetting manufacturers. Wish there was something similar for client vetting though, would've saved me from this mess.",

If the discount is conditional, make it clear.\n\nSo if your normal price is $4500 and you want to give a low income discount, you quote $3000 and state \"30% low income discount\". That way you have something to argue if you discover circumstances aren't what you were told.\n\nBut it's incredibly difficult to row back on a discount once given.  It does at least give you a clear reason not to repeat the discount for future work.\n\n&gt;*So I did something probably unethical. I looked her up. Her LLC is registered, public record. I found her personal LinkedIn. She's not some struggling entrepreneur. She sold a previous company two years ago. I can't find exact numbers but based on the acquisition announcement and her current lifestyle posts it wasn't small.*\n\nIt's not unethical.  It's due diligence.  You should always check out your clients.  It's irresponsible not to.\n\nFinish the project.  Take it as an relatively cheap lesson that you should check out your clients more carefully in future.

We were working on the branding stuff for his new business, the early stage bits, figuring out the look and feel and how he wanted the whole thing to show up.\n\nThen bad luck hit. I got slammed with this severe liver inflammation thing. The doctor told me to stay in bed for 2–3 weeks and cut my workload down so I could actually rest. I was upfront with my client about it, and he was super cool. I even managed to send small updates here and there so the project didn’t stall completely..\n\nBut after a point he just stopped replying. No “hey I need a break,” no “I’m rethinking things,” nothing. Two weeks go by. Nothing. I figured he was busy, but after the third week of being left on read, it hit me that the guy I thought was a long-term partner had just ghosted me without a word .\n\nFast forward to last week, I was scrolling through a business subreddit and saw a familiar brand name on my feed. It was him. He was asking for advice on his DIY branding and positioning assets he generated using some online tool. The stuff he posted was nothing like what he first told me he wanted. It honestly felt like he’d gone in the opposite direction overnight.\n\nTurns out some clients don’t tell you what’s bothering them. They’d rather ask the internet than have a simple five minute conversation.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with something like this or am I just catching weird luck lately ?",

If I ranked my clients into A,B,C,D list \n“buckets” - how quickly can I fire my D list clients and replace them with A list preferably or B list that I can develop into A list? \n\nAnd lastly, re: retention - any time a single client makes up more than 25% of revenue you are at risk. You inevitably start putting more effort into that account to the demise of your other clients. Come up with a feedback process that allows you to pulse check every account on a regular basis - and even if you get “We love you and will name our first born after you” - always be prospecting for a replacement client. They are always looking for ways to cut costs.",

He just kept getting paid because nobody turned off the recurring payment when the project ended!!!!  \nI checked with the team and everyone thought someone else was still using him for stuff. We’re 24 people like how does something like this even happen?\n\nApparently he’s been receiving 1.5k every month for 10 months and figured we knew what we were doing which honestly fair cuz that’s on us not him  \nThe worst part is he’s a nice guy and offered to pay some of it back but like legally that’s our fuckup not his.

The breakdown wasn’t noticing the expense, it was assumptions and communication. This was a known vendor, so the expense was assumed to be valid and being used by one of the 24 employees. Everyone assumed that someone else was using him each month. \n\nIt seems to me that this is more likely solved by having a designated point person for each business activities. That person knows whether any dies in services are being used, and if a department needs design services they talk to the lead and ask for the services. I’ve had it in my business too where people assume the other needed to buy that thing, when no one was really managing it.\n\nAnd this is really dependent on the size of the business. No matter how many financial reviews I’d have with budgets and expenses, $1500 a month wouldn’t show up unless we pulled up a transaction list and reviewed it. A larger business will have too many to go through. I have people who do go through every transaction, just like OP, but again they assumed it was legit. \n\nA business transaction $10k-$20k per month would notice and correct this before it was paid that first month.

And he kept getting paid something like $400/hr for every timesheet he put in, including any overtime he decided to rack up.\n\nNearly a year later, someone started asking questions, and he was (finally) kicked off the contract. But the department couldn't recover the better part of a million dollars they'd paid him by then; he'd quietly followed all the rules of the original contract, done all the work his many, many bosses had tossed his way, and the switchover from hourly rates wasn't something which happened automatically on a given date - it had to be signed off by one of the managers employing him.",

It may be time to outsource those finance functions but it needs to be more than a bookkeeper.  We are talking bookkeeping, controller, virtual CFO, tax compliance, the whole works.

Most will not notice. Of the ones that do, they will either:    \n\n\n- Think that's great, and buy a few extras at the discounted rate. \n\n\n- Feel like they missed the sale, but they'll mentally mark it down for next year that you occasionally have sales.    \n\n\n- In the third category, you might have some customers that purchased prior to the sale, but want the sale price. They will reach out to you if they truly want the sale price. Remember, they purchased happily at full price. If they reach out to you, asking to match the sale price for the item they already purchased, be a super cool brand and give it to them.\n\n\nRemember one thing you do not want to do is announce the sale prior to marking everything down 70%. Do it all at once, so that your customers won't wait for the sale to purchase.",

If they bought a long time ago, they likely won't even notice or care.\n2. They won't be pissed at all, and will instead see it as an opportunity to buy more of your products or buy backups/duplicates/multiple colorways of what they already own (depending on what you sell).

My bookkeeper is very good and knows my industry much better than most others, which results in fewer meetings with and less work from my CPA (whose time is significantly more expensive). \n\nIn business it’s important to recognize the value one is providing more than the price they’re charging. You could certainly find someone for much less, but if all they provide is data entry and their work is garbage it’ll result in more work and higher fees to others (CPA, Legal, etc).",

But we had to let go and I thought it'd be quick, maybe a few weeks of paperwork to get it down but wow was I wrong like nobody warned me about the actual shutdown part like you spend all this energy building something and then when it's time to close it down you're just... exhausted already, uk? And then Delaware needs this form, IRS needs that form, you're chasing down old contracts you forgot existed, a software subscription still charging u monthly, and man let me tell you this but every time I thought we were done, something else popped up. And I had to endure this for 2 months. Two whole months of this, two months of feeling like I couldn't move forward because I was stuck dealing with the past. My partner checked out emotionally pretty early, so most of it fell on me to the point where there were days I just wanted to walk away from the whole thing but kept thinking about what happens if I miss something important, what if Delaware keeps billing me or we get sued years from now because I didn't file something right.\n\nBut yeah, it's over now. Really over. And I'm sitting here feeling this weird mix of sad and relieved and tired and kind of excited? Like I can finally think about what's next without this thing hanging over me.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next tbh, I might start something new eventually, might just work for someone else for a while and not think about any of this.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to share because I see a lot of startup content but nobody really talks about this part it's messy and it sucks and it costs more than you think but you get through it eventually",

My brain was fried, it wasnt even a celebration, more like a reset. For the next one, I'm say go with your vision and your convictions 100%. \n\nI learned the hard way to never do business with family or anyone who can't follow your vision. Not understand it, just stfu and follow it, do what I say. No unsolicited opinions. And thats a big thing when you open a new business, every asshole loves to give advice. \n\nWe closed it in 2017 after 3 years and to this day we sometimes talk about it and the regrets. Everyone had their own vision, their own shit ideas. They all agreed on my original business plan but then shit kept changing on a whim.\n\nMe and my parents were on the same page but when it came to execution of the business, our relatives fucked it up. Shouldn't have gotten involved in the first place.\n\nOur vision was changed and relatives kind of took over. My parents went along with it because they felt like they had no choice.\n\nIt built so much resentment, even from me to my parents because they let it happen. I wasn't in the position to tell my relatives anything, but they were. \n\nIt was such a shitshow. Hard lessons though, fuck if we had done my original plan, it would've been successful. I see it everywhere now, our original idea for that location was executed better by other people because they did it correctly. Multiple different businesses are thriving there now, with the same vision I had before all of em. \n\nAnyway, it sucks but we learned so much from that. Mostly the psychology side of it like you can't be nice and let people walk all over you, even family. Can't be too nice to employees, and definitely should've shelled out some money to hire an experienced manager. They cheaped out on that too. \n\nI'm going to start a business again in the coming months, this time I've been researching and planning much more thoroughly. \n\nThis time it will be a singular vision. My vision. No one gets to fuck with it. No one gets to give me advice on what to do, and get butthurt if I don't follow their bullshit. \n\nIf they don't like it, they're fired. I'm steve jobbing the fuck out of this thing. That is the only way. Good luck on the next one.",

          "body": "Most start ups in any sector are like this. The founders have to do everything until they outsource, hire, or automate. \n\nIn some ways, doing everything teaches you very quickly what you need to get ride or and how much you will pay to get rid of it. \n\nAn office manager (VA, etc) might be the first hire so you can focus on revenue generating tasks. Automation that you can easy into is also a focus in the early days. Even if there is only 1-3 things you can automate, the sooner you get that stuff off your desk, the better off you will be. Do not wait until you are 100% busy as the transition (outsourcing, training, automation) will soak up some time. Better to commit to a transition when you are at 70% to 80% of capacity.\n\nExpect the early efforts to outsource, hire, automate will stumble or not be smooth. It is all part of the learning to be a CEO rather than the production person.\n\nI am working with a company right now who is very busy with the work so it is hard for them to focus on automation. We are getting there. Presently, it is a grind (long days and me providing the automation help). For another client, they have more capacity yet they really need to focus on more sales so they can afford some of the costs to scale up the team plus automate.\n\nA bit chicken and egg is my message. As someone else said, you need spare cash to fund the business growth. Working on the business vs in the business. The working on requires a bit of cash now so you can gain more than it costs in benefits later.\n\nThere is no magic here. There are things you did not know or did not understand. Normal for a young business when the founders have not built a company in the past.\n\nA business that keeps you busy and never grows is a lifestyle company or a hobby. If you want growth, there has to be time and money invested in working on the business.\n\nGood luck. Reach out if you want to chat further. Or, keep posting questions in the group and leverage the experience of those who are already where you want to be.",

When I first started out, I literally had a sticky note on my monitor that said \"you are the janitor AND the CEO\" because I kept forgetting I had to do literally everything myself.\n\n\n\nThe worst part is when you realize you're spending more time ON the business than IN the business. Like you said, days go by and you're like \"wait, did I actually do any real work or just shuffle papers and respond to emails?\" I used to joke that I became a professional email answerer who occasionally did the thing I actually started the business to do.\n\n\n\nWhat helped me was timeboxing all that admin stuff into specific blocks. Tuesday mornings became my \"business operations\" time where I'd batch all the receipts, forms, emails that weren't urgent, etc. It felt weird at first because you feel like you should be \"working\" but honestly? That IS the work when you're solo. The key is just not letting it take over your entire day every day. I also started keeping a running list on my phone of all the random business tasks that popped up so I could deal with them during those scheduled times instead of dropping everything every time something came up.\n\n\n\nThe tax stuff though... yeah that never gets easier. I still have a folder labeled \"things my accountant will explain to me like I'm 5\" because some of that stuff just makes no sense.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.",

That feeling of not getting to the “real work” because you are buried in emails, forms, and receipts is way more common than you think.\n\nOne thing that usually helps is drawing a hard line between what only you can do and what absolutely anyone competent could do for you. Stuff like tracking receipts, organizing expenses, and staying on top of tax prep is important, but it does not have to be done by you. That is exactly the kind of work a good bookkeeper can take off your plate. I work with Linda Rost’s Better Bookkeepers, and people in her lane basically specialize in turning that pile of “admin and tax stuff I don’t understand” into a simple, organized system you barely have to think about.\n\nYou are not failing at business; you are just hitting the point where doing everything yourself stops making sense. The earlier you start offloading some of the back-office stuff, the faster you get back to the work that actually grows the business.",

Stuff slipping onto your personal card is super common.\n\nWhat *does* help is tightening up the system around you so you’re not relying on willpower. Separate cards for everything business related, bank feeds into something like QuickBooks, and then simple rules that auto-tag charges (Starbucks + weekday mornings → “meals,” your software vendors → “subscriptions,” etc.). That way, when you do sit down, you’re cleaning things up instead of starting from scratch.\n\nIf you know you’re not going to keep up with it yourself, it might be worth getting a bookkeeper to step in.

People don't seem to understand I do not have billions in capital like Walmart or Amazon to allow anyone to return anything for any reason. Even Amazon is cracking down on returns due to the increase cost/frequency of returns since the pandemic. \n\n2. Rather than looking up or checking with me if an item will fit their vehicle, they just assume it will since I have to offer returns. 3 returns in 1.5 months simply due this this. Personal accountability has gone out the window. \n\n3. I do get the option sometimes to deduct from their refund, especially if they sent it back used when it was sold as new, and anytime I do, they bitch and moan about how unfair I'm being. If I sold something and it did not end up working somehow, or arrive damaged, I'm not going to do that, but if you buy a brand new car part that you did not check to see if it would fit, and literally try to force it and then damage it, then that's on you.\n\nI've tried to explain to people I can't keep prices low and allow people to just return something all the time and the recuperation of funds has to come from somewhere, but they simply do not understand nor care. If all retail businesses doled out nearly $1T in refunds last year, where do you think that money is going to come from? YOU, in the form of higher prices. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

Idk where I heard it, so take this with a grain of salt, but the likelihood of recovering funds that are over 60 days past due is like, 15% or something. So as a general rule of thumb, you really want to get ahead of receiving payments as soon as they're 2 weeks past due, and follow up weekly until it is paid. It might seem like you're being nice and patient, but you cannot afford to be patient, you are not a bank. And you're letting your customer dig themselves into a hole of debt. So, here's what you should do.\n\n1. Stop selling to them until they've paid some amount towards their balance. In the past, I've agreed to continue to sell to people like this who had previously had been on good terms, but with the notice that their future orders will be capped at 30-70% of whatever their payment is (depending on how large their balance is, and this number can change as their balance goes down). This is risky, but is a negotiation tool that could help you recover some of the funds while still maintaining a good relationship. You could also offer to accept credit cards for the balance. You might have to eat a 3% fee somewhere, but better than nothing.\n\n2. Adjust your business to be prepared to not receive any payments. Try to cut spending where you can.\n\n3. You can eventually send this to collections, but collections will only give you about 30% of what they recover (if anything). Same with a lawyer, you might win the case, but will likely never see the money, plus you now owe all the lawyer fees. \n\n4. You'll need better A/R practices moving forward. Review your aging accounts weekly, and follow up weekly once the bill is over 2 weeks past due. Notify them in those emails that unpaid bills may result in restricted ordering and finance charges. Then stop selling to them. You are not a bank. \n\n5. If you don't do it already, make sure you're asking for credit references when onboaring new customers.\n\n\nAlso, here's a calculation to see how fast they'll be able to pay off their balance while continuing weekly ordering (not sure how often they actually order).\n\n(Current balance or number of open invoices - target balance or target number of open invoices ) / (payments per week - new invoices a week) = number of weeks to pay off\n \nYou said they had months of open invoices, so I'll just assume 3 months worth of open invoices, and that ordering is weekly, so 12 open invoices. And I'm going to assume they plan to pay two invoices es weekly, and continue to order once a week.\n\n(12 - 4 (4 open weekly invoices = net 30 terms, although, you might want to move them to net 14)) / (2 invoices paid a week - 1 new weekly invoice) = 8 weeks to catch up if you keep them at net 30.\nIf you only want 2 open invoices, it adds  2 more weeks to pay off, if you want the balance at 0, it would be 3 months to pay off if they are paying two invoices a week.",

Extending terms from 7 to 14 to 30 has proven to me 100% of the time that they will not pay on time no matter how long you give them. I have a client that stiffed me for over $100k. The money was always coming next week. Next week never came and it almost bankrupted me. I'm still struggling because of it two years later. I now bill ahead as much as possible because of it.

Cut the number of things you own. If you touch everything, no habit will save you. Put your efforts on keeping it simple.\n2. Set a hard stop for the day.

First do a brain dump of every single thing you need to do no matter how urgent or how small. Write today's date at the top, then pick the things you must to do today and time box them. This is the only way you'll know what you have time for.   \n  \nI follow the mantra ***\"****Create in the AM, Connect in the PM,*\" but depending on your own energy patters use your energetic hours to do creative things, use your wind down time to do meetings and connect with people. If you have an extra five minutes, use the mantra \"*Do One Thing.*\" It might be one thing not on the list, one thing from tomorrows list, one extra thing, or just one thing. When you're really fried, use the mantra \"*Every little bit counts.\"* This will remind you that even if you simply make one phone call or take out the trash, that you're making progress.   \n  \nWhen you get something done, physically cross it off with a pen. If you need to add something, write it down. Next day edit the list from the day before, rinse and repeat.\n\nI'm sure there is science around this, but there is something magical that happens in this old school process. The brain dump reduces anxiety because you're not holding things in your head hoping they won't fall out. Creating the list each morning is very zen, and crossing things off is very affirming. There is no app in the world that works this well. I encourage all of my clients to do this, whether they're in real estate, tech, or have a brick and mortar.   \n  \nI know it sounds crazy, but it works! Hope this helps!",

I took a massive pay cut because I genuinely believed in it.\n\nSpent the last few months learning everything - cold email, LinkedIn outreach automations, n8n automations , lead gen. I was actually pretty good at it. Booked them a ton of calls. \n\nBut they ran out of money and couldn't keep me on. So that's that.\n\nAlso broke up with my girlfriend during all this. So now I'm single, broke, sitting on all these skills I don't really know what to do with.\n\nMy old construction job would probably take me back. Good money, stable work. But honestly the thought of going back feels like I failed. Like I wasted all this time learning stuff that doesn't matter.\n\nEveryone says \"just freelance\" or \"offer your services\" but like... I have no clients, no real portfolio, no clue where to start.\n\nBeen thinking about doing free work or super cheap work just to get case studies and actually talk to people. But idk if that's the move or if it just makes me look desperate.\n\nThe frustrating part is I can build websites fast now, set up email campaigns that work, automate outreach - all this stuff that should be useful. But none of it matters if I don't have anyone to actually do it for.\n\nHas anyone been through something like this? Like a career change that just feels completely stuck? How did you figure it out?",

Keep in mind that only 1% of startups ever make it big, and the next 20-30% have a mediocre exit often at a loss where employees don’t make much money at all. You could’ve been \"wasting\" years there and not make any money. That is to say, failure is an almost expected outcome for most startups. \n\nYet, if you understand the likely monetary outcome, joining a startup is an amazing opportunity to learn and grow on many dimensions. You said it yourself: you learned about a bunch of tools, techniques, and became good at it. Don’t discount how that may help in often unpredictable ways in the future. \n\nMy take: Go back to construction, own the experience and learn from it. Reframe the failure in your own mind. And rebuild your financial foundation and do some reflection over a year or so. If you want to give a startup another try you can always apply / look around in the future.",

But after doing some job searching and finding out about salaries and what jobs are less back breaking, I found that you can learn some things for free online and test out and get a certification. Of course this is something I’m mostly interested in. I’m looking to get into Cyber security. You can try Data Analyst, IT, and many other types of tech jobs. I’m not the smartest tool in the shed but I’ll tell you what, I can’t keep going on breaking my back for a job that if I get hurt I’m literally gonna lose everything and have no back up plan. Imagine getting a tech job and working from home. Not all tech jobs are like that but many are. Plus the starting salary will be comparable to what you’re likely already making, maybe 40-50k and after you get some experience that can go up to 70k to 100k+ depending on the field you’re getting into. Many variables like how big the company is and how much you keep learning and pushing yourself to the top. And I’m gonna be honest, you’re gonna need to spend probably about 4 hours a day studying and some certification exams cost about $350 or more. But people spend 80k to study this stuff in a college and go into debt. You can do it at home for a few thousand dollars and get multiple certificates in a year or two and start applying for jobs.",

It’s about leverage.\n\nWhen people first heard the term “AI automation,” they thought it meant we were going to build agents to replace every human. And to be fair, that idea exploded back in 2022 everyone was hyping up these giant end-to-end agents that were supposed to do every step of your workflow for you. But in the real world, those types of systems didn’t hold up they broke, they bottlenecked, and half the time they created more problems than they solved.\n\nSo businesses learned pretty quickly: full automation is not the goal.\n\nAI automation was never really about automation, it’s about leverage, and here’s what I mean by that:\n\nInstead of building for the sake of building, you need to understand and apply the Golden AI Ratio. It usually looks like this:\nAutomate the first 60% of the process, the boring, repetitive steps.\nUse AI to assist a human on the next 30% the parts requiring judgment or context.\nLeave the final 10% manual, because sometimes a human simply does it better.\n\nThis is what actually makes businesses faster, smarter, and more profitable.\n\nSo the real question isn’t “How do I automate everything?”\nIt’s “Where does AI give me the most leverage, and what ratio of AI-to-human will maximize that?”",

We've built workflows where 90% is automated because the process is purely data transformation with no judgment needed. And we've built others where it's more like 40/40/20 because the context changes constantly. The key isn't finding one perfect ratio, it's identifying which processes have consistent enough patterns to automate vs. which ones need human judgment.\n\nThe shift from \"automate everything\" to \"leverage strategically\" is where the real value unlocks. We burned $50k on a chatbot that tried to do too much autonomously before we learned this lesson. Now we design around what we call \"augmentation before automation\", get AI handling the repetitive context-gathering and formatting work, let humans make the judgment calls, and only fully automate the processes that are both high-volume AND low-complexity.\n\nCustomer support is a good test case. AI can pull order history and draft responses, but if your product changes weekly or your tone needs to match specific customer relationships, that 30% \"human assist\" portion gets a lot bigger.

The goal was never to eliminate the person doing the job, but to eliminate the most tedious part of their job.

      "selftext": "There seems to be a strange phenomenon in my store where kids, around the ages of 12-15 are going into my single occupant bathroom in groups of about 3 at a time. Sometimes multiple times in a short period (15 mins and back in, all of them together). I don't want to automatically assume it's drugs, but that is my first thought. I'm in a small town of about 13k people. Even if it is drugs, I wouldn't believe it to be anything harder than a weed vape pen. It doesn't smell after they leave, and it's possible it isn't drugs at all, which is somehow more concerning. I've approached the door when they're in there, knocked and told them they need to leave and they won't unlock the door or respond. \n\nThere's a camera that can see the bathroom doorway and I'm considering locking the door and having customers need a key from the front desk and after I give the key to younger people, I'll need to watch the cc TV to verify only one person using the bathroom. I hate that I have to police the bathroom that way. \n\nHas anyone else had any experience with teens going to the bathroom together? This is both groups of boys and groups of girls (have yet to see both genders together). This seems super strange to me and my first thoughts of drug use, nefariousness or kiss just being idiots. None of which I want to tolerate. ",

At school, they leave a lookout outside the door who texts them if the SRO or another admin is headed in to check things out.  And then they switch up the groups who go in.  I think that's because not everyone has access to get a vape, so they're paying the person who has it to hit it.  Plus, doing something wrong is always more fun when you're with your buds.\n\nETA: if you're in a small town, they're especially not going to vape out in the open where people can see them because we all know that ish will get back to their parents real quick.  Just lock the door and refuse access for anyone under 18 or say it's for employees only.  If it seems like a genuine need, you can unlock the door for them yourself.",

He worked for the state, and the PTO credit could be counted on like clockwork. \n\nSo the day after his PTO hits, he calls in with some excuse. One of these excuses was that he's walking up some stairs, he slips, his knee hits the edge of the stair right between his kneecap and his leg, and because of this his leg is swollen and he cannot bend it. \n\nThis all sounds credible enough, and of course the friend likes to go in intricate detail to really sell the point. \n\nNow the funny part. When he finally does go back to work. He's committed to this scheme of having a knee injury so he commits to limping around. Not only this, but he figures that if it was a legitimate injury at the beginning of a shift he would limp just a little bit, and as the day progressed he would limp more and more and so that at the end of the day he was really limping. Now I know for a fact this was all I made up story because we were drinking buddies at the time and I heard him concoct the scheme before he even did it. \n\nOkay and so now the cherry on top. After doing this for a few days, because of knee injuries not just going to go way overnight right, he's actually given an accommodation and an official recognition of service because of his working injured.",

She told me that well, actually the last time it was her grandmother's partner. After grandad died her grandmother got married to another woman and this time it was her *actual* grandmother that passed. I didn't believe her for a second but I gave her the time anyways.",

I stood up and confronted the guy, who was speaking/yelling in Spanish, which I don't speak.

They hit me with the “you need to update your yelp page.” I tell them I have never made one and please stop calling me. They keep trying to talk but I tell them I’m never giving them money so stop calling. It gets them to quit for a few months lol in my opinion, if your business (yelp) is doing so good why are you hounding me for things I didn’t even set up. I’ve heard stories like yours and that’s why I will  never use that shit. Please stop paying them. I’d they take you to collections fuck it. It’ll fall off eventually. Use that money to make more money instead of paying yelp. Or at least give me a business loan so I can grow mine. At least you’d be helping a small business lol. But for real. Please stop talking to yelp. I would make them sue me before I have them another cent.",

I proposed to my dad that we buy the 50% share of the old partner and lets run it as our own within our family. \n\nI orchestrated the whole deal and negotiations with the old business partner. After we purchased the 50% share of the business, I have implemented so many new systems that make mine and my dads life so much easier. I have hired great employees and created a social media presence. My dad works about 30 hours a week now compared to his 50-60 hours before with his partner. They both weren't running it right.  I still go to the business about 7 days a week just  to oversee operations. On paper the business is entirely in my dad's name. I put 50k of my own money into buying out the old partner.\n\nThe problem is, its been 3 years of me working almost everyday, sending my parents on vacation and making sure they're good. Holding down the family business. My dad has not once proposed to pay a single dime to me. I don't want to make it about money at all because I care way more about the relationship but I am getting a little frustrated by doing a lot of work and him not even offering to pay me at all. He has been taking large distributions from the business as I work hard. I just feel like im getting all of the headaches with none of the benefit.  I dont know how to approach this situation at all without ruining a relationship. Just venting lol",

          "body": "What was your dad's former business partner paid for his shares? In my mind, you should at least be due whatever percentage that $50,000 represents of the value of the company. If the partner was paid $100,000, for instance, you should theoretically have a 25% stake in the company (in practice, even if not on paper). So if your dad takes out a $12,000 disbursement, you would get a $4,000 disbursement. There are obviously tax implications to consider since you aren't technically an owner. \n\nI would certainly consider asking dad to formalize that ownership percentage. If you simply \"loaned\" him the $50,000, it seems to me that he could legally sell you some percentage of the shares (I am not a lawyer or accountant, just a guy who has at times had a similarly complex \"handshake\" partnership in a family business). It will be a lot easier for you to stomach technically working for free if you're seeing that benefit. \n\nI'm also curious about his plans for the business when he's no longer around. Do you have siblings? Are they involved in the business? It's important that this is spelled out now, because you wouldn't want there to be any questions once he's gone.
