I’m nowhere near being able to quit my job, but it’s enough for me to work here and there as I have spare time and build up a catalog of content to sell. It’s ebooks, for adults. With nsfw content. 😂 go figure people want that kind of stuff. Anyways, I sell it on some different storefronts and build up a readership following me. I’d say half is AI, but the other half is good creativity, else you just get lost in the storm of bad AI content. Anyhow, if anyone wants to know more, it’s pretty specialized stuff and most people don’t make much. But it’s possible. And from what I can tell, there are a lot of people out there making a lot of money in the same sort of niche. I also sell custom stories too, which I can partially make with AI. And though that’s more work, I have made almost $2k this year from 5 of those sales! \n\nEdit: Go to authormeta.com to learn as I did\n\nEdit 2: I learned from Jezebel Rose.

Just moved it online and will be doing farmer's markets in summer to expand and extend the season. Started with about $1,000 10 years ago. Hoping to double my income, but we'll see.\n\nMy previous one was selling jewelry and accessories on eBay. I did that for about 5 years, and it helped me through some very tough financial times. I had a fun store where most people bought several items and often came back. That netted $2K-$5K/month depending on the season.\n\nAnother one that was super successful for a year ($100K that year) about 15 years ago was self-publishing books. I got lucky with a few that went viral. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to keep writing for myself, but I'm working on it now. I have several books going through the pipeline, and my launches will start in January. I have three niches I'm working in, but one is starting to stand out as having more potential.",

They're able to provide so many by contracting out their growing. Each company has different requirements, but they're usually pretty clear about them. \n\nI tend to focus on Baker Creek, because they pay really well and their contracts are forgiving if things go wrong. And things will go wrong sometimes! But just be open and honest about it, they know what plants are like. They'll understand.\n\nYou can be a contract grower with any amount of space.

Figured I'd share what I found since most of the content out there is people regurgitating stuff they've never actually tried. The \"start an AI content agency\" advice needs to die. The market is completely flooded. Everyone jumped on this in early 2024 and now you're competing with thousands of people offering the same thing. Same deal with AI-generated art on print-on-demand sites. I tried this for two months and made literally $12. The designs all look the same and the market is buried in AI slop. What's actually worked for me is way less sexy. I started helping local businesses with basic AI stuff — not pitching them on \"AI solutions\" but just helping a dentist's office write better emails or showing a realtor how to speed up their listing descriptions. These people are like two years behind on this stuff and they're happy to pay someone to just figure it out for them. I also make decent money from Notion templates for a specific niche, but that took months to get traction. The uncomfortable part nobody talks about is the timeline. Nothing made real money in month one. It took me until month three or four before I was consistently hitting $300-500. Anyone promising faster results is trying to sell you a course. Curious what's actually working for other people who've moved past the \"I watched a YouTube video\" stage.",

What’s actually working today is unsexy, hyper-specific help for people who are behind on AI.\n\nWhat’s been working for me is using AI as a thinking partner with local professionals. Not selling them “AI solutions,” just helping them make better decisions faster. Example: breaking down a dentist’s patient communication flow, rewriting the scripts with AI, and helping staff use it daily. Small wins, but they pay because it saves them real time.\n\nThe pattern I’m seeing:\n\n1. Pick one profession that’s 2–3 years behind the curves.\n2. Sit with them, watch their workflow.\n3. Use AI to remove 20–30 minutes of pain from a task they repeat all week.\n4. Charge monthly for ongoing support, not one-off projects.\n\nIt’s not flashy. It’s slow for the first couple months. But once one person in that niche gets value, they refer you to others.\n\nCurious what niches others are seeing traction in.

This dividend thing took maybe 10 hours total to research and set up initially, now I just exist and money appears.\n\nThe math is pretty simple though, at 4% yield you need roughly $45k invested to make $150 monthly, which sounds like a lot but it builds faster than you think with regular contributions and reinvesting. My goal is getting to $500 monthly within a few years which would cover my car payment without working extra hours.\n\nNot saying everyone should do this or that it's easy money, just pointing out that if you're looking for actual passive income that doesn't require ongoing time investment, dividends beat pretty much every other side hustle once you get it going.",

Price $50-$100 per task.\n3. **Turn repeat work into a bundle** (templates + checklist) and sell it on Whop for passive sales.\n4. **Batch once a week** (2-3 hrs) so it doesn’t bleed into family time.\n5. **Upsell retainers** after 2-3 jobs for predictable monthly income.\n\nThis avoids ads, cold calls, and heavy setup - just focused, repeatable wins from home.",

You don’t have to be a genius as long as your mastery of the subject is higher than whoever you’re tutoring. If you’re a good teacher and can help someone master concepts (rather than just doing it for them), you’ll do great and build a business quickly.",

      "selftext": "Ninety days ago, I hit publish without a plan.\n\nNo niche.  \nNo funnel.  \nNo clear outcome.\n\nJust a promise to myself:\n\n**Write every day. Tell the truth. See what happens.**\n\nHere is what actually happened.\n\n\n\n## 1. Consistency Is the Real Differentiator\n\nIdeas are everywhere.  \nMotivation fades fast.\n\nShowing up every day is rare.\n\nMost newsletters die after five issues.  \nSome after ten.  \nAlmost none survive boredom.\n\nWriting daily forces momentum. Even bad days count. Especially bad days.\n\nMomentum compounds quietly.\n\n\n\n## 2. You Do Not Need a Niche to Start\n\nI wrote about:\n- Games  \n- Debt  \n- Kids  \n- AI  \n- Side hustles  \n- Being tired  \n- Being lost  \n\nPeople still subscribed.\n\nWhy? Because clarity comes later.  \nVoice comes first.\n\nYour niche finds you while you show up.\n\n\n\n## 3. Honesty Beats Polish Every Time\n\nThe most replies came from emails where I admitted:\n- I was stuck  \n- I was broke  \n- I did not know what to build next  \n- I was exhausted  \n\nPerfect writing gets skimmed.  \nHonest writing gets read.\n\nPeople do not connect with success.  \nThey connect with struggle in motion.\n\n\n## 4. Writing Creates Direction You Cannot Think Your Way Into\n\nBefore the newsletter, my head was noisy.\n\nToo many ideas.  \nToo many directions.\n\nWriting forced decisions.\n\nEvery sentence clarified what mattered.  \nEvery issue narrowed the signal.\n\nAction creates clarity. Not the other way around.\n\n\n## 5. You Learn What Resonates Only by Publishing\n\nI thought some topics would hit. They did nothing.\n\nI wrote throwaway thoughts that sparked replies, shares, and signups.\n\nYou cannot predict resonance from your head.\n\nYou discover it in public.\n\n\n\n## 6. Momentum Is Fragile. Protect It Aggressively\n\nSkipping one day feels harmless.\n\nIt is not.\n\nSkipping breaks the streak.  \nBreaking the streak kills momentum.  \nMomentum is everything.\n\nSome days I wrote at 3 AM.  \nSome days I wrote tired.  \nSome days I wrote with nothing interesting to say.\n\nThose days mattered most.\n\n\n\n## 7. Writing Builds Trust Before It Makes Money\n\nNinety days in, I did not get rich.\n\nBut something better happened.\n\nPeople trusted me.\n\nThey replied.  \nThey asked questions.  \nThey shared ideas.  \nThey followed my projects.\n\nTrust is the asset.  \nMoney follows trust.\n\n\n\n## 8. Your Life Is Content If You Pay Attention\n\nI stopped hunting for ideas.\n\nLife provided them.\n\n- A bike ride  \n- A sick kid  \n- A failed product  \n- A small win  \n- A bad day  \n\nYou do not need inspiration.  \nYou need awareness.\n\n\n## 9. Building in Public Keeps You Accountable\n\nWhen people expect tomorrow’s email, quitting gets harder.\n\nThat pressure is good.\n\nIt turned writing into a habit instead of a mood.\n\nAccountability creates endurance.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Ninety Days Is Just the Beginning\n\nNothing magical happens on day ninety.\n\nNo finish line.  \nNo sudden clarity.  \nNo overnight win.\n\nBut something shifts.\n\nWriting becomes normal.  \nSharing becomes easier.  \nConfidence grows quietly.\n\nYou stop asking, “Should I keep going?”\n\nYou just keep going.\n\nI don't plan on stopping. Look for another update in 90 days when I hit 180 days of writing a daily newsletter! \n\nComment below any questions i'll answer them all! \n\n\n",

I’m looking at putting some of my money into investments aswell, talking to people who invest and trying to learn (am a begginner). But I want to fill up that time especially in the weekdays after work, ways online or in any way to make some more money (preferably not something like labour as my body is tired after work, work 10 hour days). Willing to invest my money into something/things for this, just don’t know what yet. Am trying to find work for the morning of the weekend aswell (scaffolders I’m in connection with don’t work on weekends usually).\n\nAny tips to make money during the week on the way home from work and at night once I get home? And I don’t want to do surveys or anything like that, not worth my time. Something that I can make decent money, even if I have to invest money i don’t mind. Scared money don’t make no money haha. Aswell any tips on small passive incomes aswell, where I don’t have to spend too much time during the week and make a little bit of money. Things that pay out like surveys but don’t take as much time. \n\nOkay i’ll stop yapping thanks",

Give us specifics on the steps you took for each of these:\n\n* selling your art\n* Amazon KDP low-content books\n* POD\n* selling stuff online\n\nI've found from personal experience that all the things I \"failed at\" were things I didn't actually follow through on. \n\nLike - when I first started a blog (back in 2008, when you literally could get monetized after a couple of weeks just writing about a game on your iphone), I got approved for AdSense, then got bored and abandoned it instead of finding a niche I actually loved and sticking with it. So ... no millions from AdSense.\n\nGot approved for Amazon Affiliate - wrote a few blog posts and gave up because it wasn't converting \"fast enough\" for my liking. Guess what? If I'd done even ONE BF promo or a \"gift ideas for Christmas\" kind of post and *promoted it*, I'd have made enough to make me stick with it. So ... no millions from Amazon Affiliate.\n\nGot approved for Amazon Merch .... same story.\n\nDo you see the pattern here? It's not enough to START. You need to stick with something long enough to give it time to work, rather than giving up after a short while. \n\nPick a thing. Anything. Figure out how to get it online. \n\n***Do some actual promotion.*** &lt;- Without this, no online venture can succeed these days, there's just TOO much noise out there. So you'll need to put money into ads (the quickest way to get people to see what you're selling, and to buy, but you risk spending a lot of money if you don't know what you're doing and don't keep an eagle eye on that ad spend). Or you'll need to spend money figuring out how else to get discovered - either by posting regularly or by partnering with someone who does know what they're doing and can get you sales.\n\nYouTube can help you figure out where you're stumbling in a particular venture. Can help you get past the obstacles. More than any course you can buy, you'll learn by actually DOING the thing and figuring out how to get past the roadblocks. And there are roadblocks in everything we try that is new to us.\n\nGood luck. If you stick with something long enough, I can promise you you'll learn enough to make it work.",

          "body": "I'm not sure what you meant by selling your art, but if it was on Etsy, that's a LONG game. And even then, you're not guaranteed to be seen with all the other million of sellers. The people that do best on Etsy are the ones with a good social media following. \n\nI've been selling on Etsy since 2014 and it's not a big money maker for me. Partly because I can't scale my handmade items even if they did catch on. But I make enough to keep me going, giving me a small profit for a small bit of work.\n\nI don't have a social media presence, but I do okay. It took from 2014 - 2017 of learning Etsy SEO (which is not at all like Google SEO or eBay SEO), finding what works in my niche, oh and the biggie is to **have a niche**. Can you say exactly what your art is and identify a particular person and not generally 'people who have bulletin boards'? \n\nFor instance, I sell push pins, but my niche is Kawaii Cute style, and I only sell push pins.\n\nIf I need money, then selling things around the house on eBay is usually my best option, too. I was lucky my daughter was into collectibles figures, and even though (or because?) she played with them, they sold well. Sometimes I go to charity shops and find Barbie or My Little Pony things and those sell well. Even when selling on eBay, get a niche. Niches sell better than just throwing things up. When I sell on eBay it's usually toys. And because of that I now have an eye for what toys sell.\n\nIf I went around and just bought random things, I'd have more misses (things that don't sell) than hits with fast selling items.\n\nPeople are not making millions with PDFs unless the PDF is in a specific niche that people need.\n\nOn Etsy, there is a person that does make a lot of money with Excel spreadsheets. But she is very good with Excel and is able to do good customer service since she understands Excel and how people will mess up the formulas.  She can also customize the Excel spreadsheets for what Etsy sellers need. \n\nIf you have a strength that someone needs for their business, then that's the way to go. Her shop is successful (in my opinion) due to word of mouth. When I see on Etsy seller forums someone asking for accounting help, they will mention this shop and say they liked her forms. These cost about $100 each, but people buy them because she is good at what she does.\n\nPOD is always tough, even if you have your own artwork. There are so much POD shirts (etc) that it's hard to get seen. At one time (Etsy has been cracking down a little bit on this) people would buy a design on CreativeFabrica and without changing a thing stick it on a POD shirt. At one time if you looked up Be Kind t-shirt you'd see over 1,000 listings of the exact same \"Be Kind\" with Boho rainbow in the same colors, all the listings one after another. This made Etsy search a bit boring, so Etsy did crack down and reminded people that the seller has to change the design significantly enough for it to be unique. \n\nEven so, POD is not the road to riches. One youtuber showed how much he made with POD shirts. With advertising (which he said he needed) he made $1.00 for each shirt. Without Advertising he made something like $3 or so on POD shirts. When he started printing his own shirts in his garage he ended up with about $10 profit from each shirt, but as you can imagine that is a lot of work. \n\nNow he is an Etsy Coach. I don't even think that is the way to riches, but it pays better than POD. It takes a lot to get seen in that area as well. \n\nMy thoughts: you have to be fantastic at marketing (or at least find your audience somewhere like on TikTok or Pinterest) and have an equally fantastic product. But then, sometimes foreign manufacturers (or even Michaels, the craft store) will see it, copy it and mass produce it for pennies on the dollar. I do better at my 9-5 (despite what Etsy coaches say) than I do in my Etsy shop.\n\nMy reliable \"side hustle\" is Fetch Rewards. It's not much, though. I probably average enough points every 3 months for a $50 gift card. The games have the most points, not the receipts. \n\nI consider my Etsy shop more like a part time job. It doesn't bring in much, there are no benefits, but I'm always on call to answer customer questions. Not what I call a side hustle. 😋\n\nGood luck!",

      "selftext": "Flip stuff on Facebook marketplace or Craigslist. It's surprisingly easy to find decent prices on stuff. I did this for a stint between jobs and it was surprisingly effective.  Obviously it fluctuates but on average I'd probably make $100-500 a week and spent maybe 10-60mins total per week (sourcing stuff, posting it and meeting people)\n\n\n\n\nMy process:\n\n\n\nUse [warehousewatcher.com](http://warehousewatcher.com) to find Amazon warehouse deals, alot of that stuff is 40% off + and is in like new condition. If you can't find a buyer you can always return it too.\n\n\nAlso if you go directly on [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) enter \"warehouse deals\" in the search field, this also lets you look through their warehouse items, however they've made it increasingly hard to see what's actually in stock without clicking on the item first.\nAnother excellent way to source product is if you're lucky enough to have online auctions with local pickup near you. You'd be surprised how cheap you can get things simply because you don't have competition.\n\n\n\n Places like maxsold.com list estate sales, auctions etc nearby Also places like canoe.com, keepa.com and camelcamelcamel.com are useful for finding lightning deals to flip as well. Just check camelcamelcamel to see how much it's worth regularly.\n\n\n\n\nRules, always meet in public, preferably somewhere you can get to within 2 mins or less. And never leave until they say they've arrived. This way you don't actually waste any time if people decide to ghost you (which will happen)\n\n\n\n\nIt just occured to me to post this after several friends and family just told me they were tossing out perfectly new stuff because it was \"taking up space\". I told them to list it on marketplace and it literally just never occurred to them that they could do that. Just in case others are in the same habit, thought I'd bring it up.",

I had way too much time, way too many tabs open, and zero idea what would actually work. I remember picking one simple niche, throwing together a small site, and writing a few pages just based on stuff I was already googling myself. no grand plan, just “if I’m confused about this, someone else probably is too.”\n\nthe mistake I made early was expecting fast results. every day I’d check traffic like it was a heartbeat monitor. nothing. weeks went by and it felt dead. instead of scrapping it, I left it alone because honestly I was tired of starting over. that turned out to be the accidental win. while I was distracted with other things, that little site slowly started getting search traffic.\n\nthe first time a commission showed up, I thought it was a reporting error. it was small, but it felt unreal because I hadn’t done anything that day. then it happened again a week later. that’s when I understood what people meant by “passive” — not no work, just work done earlier finally paying rent.\n\n**Takeaway:** 2020 taught me that most online stuff doesn’t need brilliance, it needs time. if something is useful and you don’t kill it too early, it has a chance to surprise you later.",

Easier to get clients than long form youtube stuff too since the turnaround is faster.\n\nUGC could work but it's getting really saturated and brands are picky. Unless you have a specific niche or look they're after, it might be harder to break into than the other options.\n\nAppointment setting has hype because it's basically sales without the closing part. If you're good at talking to people and following up it pays well but it's also commission based usually so income can be unstable starting out.\n\nMost lucrative long term is probably SMMA if you can scale it. Easiest to get first clients is video editing since you can show a portfolio fast and there's tons of demand.\n\nNone of these are easy full time gigs immediately tho. You'll probably need to do your 9-5 for a while and build the side thing for 6+ months before it can replace your income.

I did this for a stint between jobs and it was surprisingly effective. \n\n\n Obviously it fluctuates but on average I'd probably make $100-500 a week and spent maybe 10-60mins total per week (sourcing stuff, posting it and meeting people)\n\n\n\n\nMy process:\n\n\n\n\nUse warehousewatcher.com to find Amazon warehouse deals, alot of that stuff is 40% off + and is in like new condition. If you can't find a buyer you can always return it too.\n\n\n\n\nAlso if you go directly on amazon.com enter \"warehouse deals\" in the search field, this also lets you look through their warehouse items, however they've made it increasingly hard to see what's actually in stock without clicking on the item first. Another excellent way to source product is if you're lucky enough to have online auctions with local pickup near you. You'd be surprised how cheap you can get things simply because you don't have competition.\n\n\n\n\nPlaces like maxsold.com list estate sales, auctions etc nearby Also places like canoe.com, keepa.com and camelcamelcamel.com are useful for finding lightning deals to flip as well. Just check camelcamelcamel to see how much it's worth regularly.\n\n\n\n\nRules, always meet in public, preferably somewhere you can get to within 2 mins or less. And never leave until they say they've arrived. This way you don't actually waste any time if people decide to ghost you (which will happen)",

So the idea was, DO THIS HARD WORK for X amount of time, THEN enjoy the benefits of that work LONG after its made.\n\nBut new people, like OP, started coming into this space, or learned of this term without knowing the history of the term, and began critiquing others using the word properly.",

By your logic, not even investing is true passive income because:\n1) the money still needed to be earned one way or another.\n2) someone is still out there actively managing that investment (whether it is you or a broker)\n\nSo, if someone invests upfront time and costs into a vending machine business that needs to be emptied and stocked (say once a month), the entire month that it’s not being actively stocked or emptied it is earning you passive income. I would argue that vending machines are a source of TRUE passive income since they can’t be use while being filled…\n\nThe same maintenance schedule can be applied to buying and selling stocks. Once you invest that first initial time, or any subsequent time if you buy and/or sell, it becomes active, but while it sits there, it is passive.\n\nOnce you make and upload a YouTube video, it can now bring in passive income (in theory; popularity and many other factors play a big role). Once production is done, the video needs little/no maintenance to continue to get views and have earning potential. Sure, you have to put in work to make the videos and set up ads or whatever you need to do, but each video you make and upload creates its own stream of passive income.",

          "body": "I think you’re half right and half wrong.\n\nPassive income isn’t really about the amount of work you have to put in, but whether or not income is or can be automated. Even if something still needs your involvement to really take off, if sales or revenues or whatever can theoretically come without your direct involvement, that’s technically passive income.\n\nFor example, I am an author. I recently published a middle grade / young adult superhero novel. I have it available as an ebook to buy or read on Kindle Unlimited, and the paperbacks are available via Print on Demand. I’m still at the point where I have to do a TON of marketing work for each sale as I am a brand new unknown author, but each sale occurs without my input. Someone could be purchasing my book right now and I have nothing to do with that directly. That’s passive income. I CAN make sales even when I’m not directly involved.\n\nCompare that to if I brought a couple dozen copies of my book to a book festival to sell. That would be active income. Not because it’s harder or more work, but because I am personally involved in each sale. I am personally speaking to the customer, taking their money, putting the book into a bag, etc. It’s active income because it fundamentally requires my involvement; if I were to pack my books up and leave, the sales stop. This has nothing to do with me not being well known yet. It’s just how it works.\n\nThe issue is that people hear “passive” and they watch all the finance bro passive income YouTubers shilling their crypto shitcoins, and they think that it means no work. A phrase I heard a decade ago that I always tell people is “passive income does NOT denote passive activity”. There are active income streams that involve far less work than some passive income streams. That doesn’t change the fundamental income mechanisms that make them active of passive income.\n\n\n\nBy the way, if anyone’s looking for a book to give to a tween, teen, or young adult (or any age) book or superhero lover, I can post a link to it. 🙃 See? I still need to do a lot of work marketing.",

          "body": "IMO, there isn’t really a single “skill” that leads to passive income. What works is learning how to package something you’re good at and getting it in front of the right people.\n\nThat “something” can sit anywhere on a spectrum:\n\n\t•Services (tutoring, proofreading, childcare) → more active, easier to start\n\n\t•Digital products (printables, templates) → create once, sell repeatedly\n\n\t•Content/affiliates → slower burn, more scalable\n\nServices usually require more hands-on effort, but they’re a great entry point. For example, tutoring or kids’ activities are best marketed in parent spaces — PTA groups, school newsletters, community boards, libraries, coffee shops near schools, etc.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I made cootie catchers out of flyers advertising myself as a mother’s helper and handed them out at our community pool. My mom shared them through PTA connections. That’s not advanced marketing — it’s just knowing where your audience already is and when they’re mentally open to noticing your offer.\n\nPrintables sit closer to the “passive” end. You create them once (worksheets, planners, kids’ activities) and sell them repeatedly on sites like Etsy. But it’s saturated, so discovery still matters. You don’t need to be a marketing expert — just understand the basics of SEO, algorithms, and when /your/ audience is active.\n\nIf you’re product- or lifestyle-focused (beauty, fashion, fitness, home), affiliate links (Amazon, LTK, “link in bio”) are another route. Same principle, different channel.\n\nThe closest thing to passive income comes after upfront effort: build once, market intentionally, then let systems and word of mouth take over.",

Buy a small content site with existing traffic\n\nBut don’t buy random Flippa junk. Look for:\n\n6–12 months of Google Search Console data\n\n50%+ traffic from informational keywords\n\nMonetized via affiliates or lead gen (not ads alone)\n\n\nAfter buying:\n\nUpdate top 10 posts\n\nAdd better CTAs\n\nRepurpose content to Pinterest + Reddit + Quora This alone can 2–3× revenue without new content.\n\n\n2. Build a “semi-passive” site + paid traffic for validation\n\nInstead of waiting for SEO:\n\nPick one boring but profitable niche (finance tools, SaaS, health accessories, B2B services)\n\nBuild 20 high-intent pages\n\nSpend $500–$1k testing Google or Pinterest traffic\nOnce you find pages that convert → scale or hand off.\n\n\n3. Digital asset &gt; product\n\nBuying a site that sells a single digital product (template, calculator, checklist) is often cleaner than blogs.\n\nNo inventory\n\nHigher margins\n\nEasier to automate with email + retargeting\n\n\n4. What I’d avoid\n\n“Automated” Amazon sites\n\nAI-generated content farms\n\nSites without email lists or search data\n\n\nPassive income today = upfront work + owned traffic → maintenance later.\nAnything truly hands-off is usually either oversold or underperforming",

If the spread is 19 points you want to pay no more than .35 percent that is a guide.  The part you want is for it to be in an uptrend.  Keep in mind right.

Just their desk. So I'm definitely not showing my face anywhere.\n\nBeen trying to make productivity content work since August. Time management tips, how to organize your day, that kind of stuff. Figured it couldn't be that hard.\n\nIt was that hard.\n\nStarted with text over stock footage. Coffee cups and notebooks. Nobody watched. Maybe 400 views per video and it took forever to edit each one.\n\nTried filming my hands writing in a planner after a few weeks. One video got 1900 views and I thought I figured it out. Made a bunch more. They got like 500 each. So I didn't figure it out.\n\nKept posting through September and October. Views stayed around 500 to 700. Wasn't great but at least it was consistent.\n\nThen I bought better equipment because everyone said quality matters. Microphone for $95. Got a music subscription and some caption app. Was paying like $40 a month for tools. My videos looked way more professional.\n\nViews got worse. Dropped back down to 400, sometimes 300. I literally spent money to go backwards.\n\nMy roommate kept asking how it was going in this voice like she thought the whole thing was pointless. It probably was. I'd been doing it for months and made zero dollars.\n\nFew weeks ago I just changed everything. Made the videos look like an actual person talking instead of text floating around. Using CapCut for editing, APOB for the face part since I obviously can't use mine, and Riverside for audio. About $30 a month total so at least it's cheaper than before.\n\nViews got better. Not consistent but better. Some videos get 5000 views, some get 1800. I still have no idea why. Posted two videos about morning routines last week. Same style, same length. One got 5800 views and one got 1600. Makes zero sense.\n\nI'm at 1900 followers now. A productivity app reached out last week and paid me $100 for a sponsored video. First money I've made from this.\n\nTold my roommate and she was like oh wow you actually made money. Yeah. $100. After four months. That covers my share of groceries for two weeks.\n\nI still don't know what I'm doing. Some videos work and most don't. The algorithm feels completely random. I'm putting in maybe 5 hours a week and I can't tell if it's going anywhere.\n\nThe $100 is something but it's also basically nothing. I could've done Uber Eats on weekends and made way more without spending hours trying to figure out why one video gets 5800 views and another gets 1600.\n\nBut what if I quit now and next month I actually start making decent money. Or what if I keep going and it stays like this and I just wasted more time.\n\nI'm tired of not knowing if this is worth it or if I should just cut my losses and do something that actually pays consistently.\n\nHow long did it take you to figure out if content was actually worth sticking with?",

I am on a fixed income (SSDI) and have had trouble even keeping a fast food job in the past because of how overwhelmed I kept getting. My girlfriend has health issues and can’t work either. We have had to earn extra income through DoorDash, but it’s not always available for us and income from that has dwindled. She drives and I just pick up the food and drop it off. I cannot drive because I am incredibly scared to, and the amount of reckless drivers in my city have put me off of even wanting to try to learn how to drive. \n\nI do have a really good PC that we got a while back which has the 12GB Nvidia RTX 5070, 64GB of RAM, and 2TB of Storage space. I point this out because I figure there is something I can do with my PC. It’s powerful enough for image generation, RVC, and can even run some LLMs locally. My problem is that I do not know where to go or start. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nThanks for reading.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche.\n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1.\t⁠start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n2.\t⁠once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n3.\t⁠once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course.\n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you.\n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

You could buy some of the cheaper books and up charge them when reselling. Like I saw a book online for $20, that cost $200 at like Walmart. As long as they are more affordable than the brand new copies, and you build a reputable reputation, people might pay more than the cheapest option if they know that they can trust the seller.\n\nYou could work with college students, because colleges tend to upcharge a crazier amount than regular stores. (Literally got my college to lower their textbook price by $200 just because a local store had it $200 cheaper.)

      "selftext": "Tested this at a local rei meetup after hearing the same problem from every investor I talked to. Everyone owns 5-20 properties but nobody has any clue which ones perform well, they're all just guessing on rent prices and maintenance budgets, flying blind on which property to sell first if they need cash.\n\nConvinced 3 friends to give me read only access to their property data for a free trial. Sent them weekly reports showing underperforming units, rent optimization opportunities, maintenance spending alerts, market comparisons against similar properties in their area. All 3 offered to pay immediately after first report, didn't even finish the trial period.\n\nBuilt it into a service at $99/month. “How is this a passive income?” I use leni to automate the analysis work and get all the necessary insights fast. No manual hours per cliet, which would've also made this impossible to scale. Now at 47 subscribers which is $4,653/month. Time investment is maybe 4-5 hours weekly reviewing what gets flagged and personalizing the reports with my insights.\n\nGrowth has been 100% word of mouth through investor groups and rei [meetups.Business](http://meetups.Business) model works because investors know they're leaving money on table but don't have time or skills to analyze properly. I'm not doing anything sophisticated, just filling gap between \"I know I should track this\" and tracking it. Like one client found few thosands in missed rent increases just from first analysis, another discovered they should've sold a property 2 years ago based on performance trends.",

          "body": "If anything, learn a hard skill/career that you can practice and make money solely on. Writing, video editing, digital marketing, web development. It's best to focus on one, but you will likely find yourself having to do other things around it, which does give a good platform for later on should you wish to go down those routes. \n\nStart with those and build around it, a lot of the less tangible skills will come through your own understanding and maturity. For instance, copywriting requires the ability to research, and also doing it to create your own understanding (especially now with AI lowering the bar a bit). \n\nI started with writing articles, and that led me into copywriting. I learned how SEO worked, how to monetise blogs and websites, how to communicate with potential clients. That's just one line of work, but it's just an example of how you can branch out your skills and insight the further you go. \n\nIt's better to start slow and steady as well with these, go into it with the idea of becoming good at what you do, rather than making money. The competition is massive online, but excelling and standing out is what gives longevity from my experience. Most of my opportunities have come from people seeing the quality of my work and the results, rather than me having to hard sell to them. \n\nAlso, you should consider attitudes more than anything. Be patient, put the effort in, don't make shortcuts and become resilient. It takes time to get anywhere reasonable, and you need to temper your expectations at times, but the success cut through eventually and that's what you need to focus on.\n\nEdit: Just realised this was the passive income sub, not the one I thought it was. A lot of this still rings true, but focus on a niche you're interested in and build something around that. You can practice skills easily, you will understand the market/industry/topic better and you will have an easier time getting the ball rolling.",

First month I made like $50 while building reviews but now it's steadier. Takes time though, maybe 2-3 months before it feels worth it. Also Upwork now makes you buy connects to apply to jobs but if your profile is good u might get invited for the jobs so if your buildin a profile there make sure to keep it polished.\n\nRemote part time work like customer service or virtual assistant jobs. \n\nFor smaller amounts faster, survey and reward apps work but they're slow. I make around $80-100 a month from a few apps combined using stuff like Swagbucks, Branded Surveys, and Babki which has both surveys and games. It's not impressive but it covers my Spotify and food between paychecks. Takes maybe 2 weeks to see your first cashout depending on the app.\n\nAs a finance student you could also look into tutoring high school kids through Wyzant or similar sites. Pays better than surveys and you can set your own rates.\n\nThe honest answer is nothing pays quick and easy. The stuff that pays well takes months to build up. The stuff that pays immediately doesn't pay much. Pick based on whether you need money this week or you're okay with a longer ramp up for better pay later.",

I stopped chasing a bunch of different ideas and focused on building one small, beginner-friendly digital income stream. I treated it like a process instead of a shortcut: try something, see what worked, adjust, repeat. \n\nProgress was way slower than the hype makes it seem, but it also felt more real. And honestly, more sustainable. I think a lot more people would succeed if we talked openly about that early phase instead of pretending it’s effortless from day one.",

      "selftext": "Hi.. i'm a 16 year old and i guess i'm just writing this because i don't have anyone else to talk to. I go to school from 8am to 1 and after that my day is basically empty most of the time. Since the pandemic, my life hasn't really been interesting at all. I don't have any friends to hang out with or spend time with so i'm always just by myself. Most of my time goes into scrolling reels or randomly learning things online, mostly related to finance. Finance is one of the few things that genuinely interests me. Sometimes I just sit and think about money, businesses, how people make it, how systems work. I know that might sound weird for my age but that's just how it is.\n\nI tried flipping game accounts for almost 8 months. I didn't have any money to start with so I couldn't buy accounts and resell them. Instead I used to promote other people's resell accounts with their permission for a small commission or for a cheap account worth the commission. I actually did sell around 3-4 accounts but I never received my commission as the account owners eventually ghosted or straight up scammed me.\n\nAnother problem was that I didn't own the accounts. I didn't have the login ids or passwords so when buyers asked for proof I couldn't log in and show them which I completely understand from their side. Because of this I couldn't sell many accounts and after months of trying I ended up earning nothing.\n\nStill, one thing I can honestly say is that during those 8 months, I never scammed a single person. Even when I could have. Even when I was frustrated. That might sound small but it matters to me.\n\nRight now, I have a lot of free time and the thought of making money is always in my head. Not big money. Not some crazy income. Even a couple of dollars would mean a lot to me, just to know I can earn something on my own.\n\nSince I'm under 18, I don't have a bank account yet. I also don't want to use my parents' money or their bank accounts. I want whatever I earn to be completely mine. So I made a crypto wallet to receive payments, and if I ever need to cash out, I transfer it to my cousin's wallet since he's above 18.\n\nMy parents don't even know I'm trying to do side hustles. I have always had this dream of surprising them one day with my first earnings no matter how small and gifting them something valuable with money I made myself.\n\nI'm not lazy. I'm not looking for shortcuts. I'm just.. lost. I have time and i'm willing to learn and I genuinely want to be financially independent even if it starts very small.\n\nIf anyone here understands my situation or has realistic side hustle ideas for someone my age with no capital, i would really appreciate your advice.\n\nThanks for reading this.",

No dramatic blow up, no big revelation, just the quiet realization that I could not keep pretending I enjoyed it.\n\nSince then, I bought half of a 40-year-old family business and started building a Miami-focused real estate platform. (Both sites were basically vibe coded by me with basic programming experience. Hiring them out would have been over $100k - irrelevant detail).\n\nWhat has been insane is the lifestyle freefall.\n\nI was always scared to become an entrepreneur because of this exact thing. Now I am living it.\nOne business is profitable but still early stage. The other is a startup that needs heavy lifting.\nBoth require marketing, ads, experiments, money going out before money comes in.\nI underestimated how competitive it is just to get attention. Meta ads, Google ads, creative testing, all of it. I really thought I could just show up and grow something. Absolutely delusional.\n\nThe hardest part?\nIgnoring the headhunters calling with mid six figure jobs.\nI know I can go back. I know I can make money tomorrow. But that is the life I spent years trying to escape.\n\nAnd then there is the identity shift.\nTelling girls I am building companies instead of being the finance guy at a big fund.\nNot casually dropping $200 on sushi like it is nothing.\nNot skiing every winter.\nNot having that easy, comfortable narrative of I am doing well.\n\nIt is humbling. Honestly, some days it is embarrassing. I did not expect it to hit this hard.\n\nBut I also have so much respect now for entrepreneurs who stuck through this phase and made it work. You do not realize how much grit it takes until you are the one staring at the ceiling at 3AM wondering if you are insane.\n\nRant over.\n\nWould love to hear if anyone else went through this identity and lifestyle whiplash when switching from a high paying job to entrepreneurship.",

When you have children and a top tier college tuition is $800k for 4 years, you’ll understand what is important: a lambo and and LV CRAP, or your children’s education and health.\n\n#3) on your deathbed, what will you really regret? Putting yourself out there and trying to make it as an entrepreneur? Or regretting not being more of a baller in Miami?\n\nMy biggest flex is that I want to be worth multiple millions, and no one would know.

Don’t be embarrassed, a 2-5 year stretch in your life does not dictate your success or failure in life forever. Think clearly, and with foresight.\n\nI started My business in 2016 and have finally achieved “success” in 2025. 9 years of hell, depression, conviction, mental fortitude.

I didn’t like London and I was sick of the job but the fact is it was easy to coast along and collect the paycheck.  It’s amazing how much these high profile IB jobs lets you just ride along on the franchise once you get to a certain level.  Life would have been easy (minus the brutal commute) if I was able to suck up the politics and work drama.

You’ve also got to determine what the exit looks like, and when to say when. Various bench marks along the way and awareness to play improv when the unseen appears.\n\nAll the feelings- negative and positive- exist in every arena.

I feel like this everyday and it’s a mental battle but it gets easier everyday and you learn to live with it and learn to love it.\n\nQuitting because you weren’t happy deep down was the most brave thing you could have done in life.

All work sucks. At least you’re getting paid and can move up to another company if you thought ahead prior to quitting and also your young. Making that money at 30 is rare. \n\nSecond thought is fuck you again. People dream of making 33% of what you were making. Entrepreneurship is hard. Owning your own business is a slog.  Owning is not as easy as a collecting 300k a year, probably work from home, with 30 days PTO job. It’s actually difficult. You’re lucky to have the cushion to support yourself and your business. And be young enough where you don’t have kids to have to support too. \n\nYour biggest concern is telling girls you’re building companies instead of being in finance?. Give me a break. That’s the douchiest thing I’ve ever heard. \n\nBe humble. Build your product. Shut the fuck up and get your head in the right place. Ownership and being a founder is not easy. Learn from your mistakes and be thankful you can pay your bills while your company(s) grow and while mistakes are made. \n\nI’m 44. Built and shipped 9 apps, partner in a vintage retail store, and wrote a self help book for people with terminal illness. I worked for someone else for 3 years total in my life. Business ownership isn’t easy nor is it for everyone. Good for you for trying.  The reality of entrepreneurship, not everyone succeeds. Not everyone exits for 100M\n\nTake a year or two and work the business. If it fails, it fails. My advice, keep your day job, stay humble and work the business untill it can replace your salary. Or just be happy making 300K at 30 years old.",

I enjoy working with my hands and physically feel tired rather than being a mind zombie at night.\n\nWhen I was working in finance, the research, the deals were fun but I was lacking satisfaction that you get when you actually accomplish something and see the results. Every so often I would sit in front  of the screens and think to myself what would be if I had my own company..\n\nOne day I was at the office and said fuck it, gave my two weeks, and left. After that went to school to get the licenses it took 9 months. Once the company started operating it was just go go go, spend money to earn money. I can’t say I was expecting it to be easy, but the construction business is kind of bad (for me) and I’m realizing it now.\n\nI am an honest person and pretty fair and ethical. I have my prices and pay subtrades  early and full amounts, don’t hassle with them, I want them to win. All that for its to only bite me in the ass after. Work is badly done, and I have to swallow the problem. \n\nI deal with businesses, and the delays are 30-45 days on paper, but in reality it’s 60-90-120 days. What really sucks is that I’m essentially financing projects out of pocket, to then wait and suck up for stuff that wasn’t part of the deal so I please the clients to not only get my money back, but to get paid.\n\nAnyway the image change and ego is what I think stops me from going all in. Going from fancy offices, travelling, spending thousands at restaurants to now always surviving. I essentially have one foot in this new career and the other still in finance, every so often I think of going back. To this day I haven’t updated my LinkedIn since leaving finance because there’s something I feel embarrassed about. \n\nThe entrepreneurial life is hard, depending of your resources and how you approach it. I had to bootstrap it, and doing much more work in different fields now. The testing part is hard, the client acquisition is hard, managing people especially hard headed construction guys is hard, bitchy and demanding clients. Everything about entrepreneurship is hard, I thought construction was in such demand, yeah maybe it is if you’re building new neighborhoods or government contracts, but you have to get to that point, and that’s the hardest part.\n\nI feel ya!",

It’s one thing to imagine the tradeoffs when you’re still getting a big paycheck, and a whole different thing to live inside all the uncertainty without the comfort of the old identity propping you up. the ego hits are almost worse than the financial ones. Losing the easy answer to “so what do you do” feels like getting knocked back to zero.\n\nthe weird part is that this phase is pretty normal. everyone I know who made the leap went through a stretch where they felt broke, invisible and kind of foolish for walking away from something stable. It doesn’t mean you chose wrong. It just means you’re in that in-between zone where you haven’t built the new life yet, but the old one is already gone.\n\nit gets lighter once the wins stack up a bit and you stop comparing everything to the lifestyle you had before. Until then, it’s a grind mentally as much as financially. You’re not crazy for feeling it. This is just the part nobody advertises.",

      "selftext": "After 5 years of starting and growing a cleaning business, I recently just signed the dotted line to sell it! I have officially exited my first business!\n\nFunny to think I stumbled across a Reddit post about starting a cleaning business and did everything that it said lol. Shout out Rohan and anyone who got started from that thread.\n\nIt only felt right to make this post on Reddit because this is where it all started.\n\nThis post isn’t a “how to start a cleaning business” or anything, just sharing a few things from my journey. If you have questions you can ask away!\n\nWhen I started, it was at the beginning of the “remote cleaning business” model era. It took me time to get the business started because I was in college. Once I cracked marketing, which was right before I graduated back in 2021, things began to roll.\n\nApril 2021 I had my first 10-cleaning month. June I had my first 20-cleaning month and July we went up to 30 cleanings. I was all in on the business since then. It was my full-time job, but it was more like a full-time masterclass on business, MBA and the gulag you go through as an entrepreneur. I’m 26 years old now and since starting the business I’ve grown so much when I sit back and reflect. I’m no guru either! I’m from Detroit, I moved to Atlanta to go to Morehouse College, I started my cleaning business my senior year, and since graduating I’ve spent my life up to this point of writing this running the business. \n\nAt the height of the business, which is when I decided it was time to sell, I had the business operating on a chaotic rope.\n\nI had residential cleaning customers and commercial contracts . At one point we had a number of Airbnb properties we did cleaning for and at another point operated all three at the same time. (Was a freaking zoo!) I had a great office manager named V who was the sweetheart and pitbull for me and the business. I had a great team &amp; rolodex of cleaners who, after all the mayhem, worked with us for multiple years at a time. When it was time to ascend, we eventually got another star named J who was our sales rep alongside me.\n\nThe business was at a point where a majority of the business was operating on a system and I checked on everything from my phone.\n\nThis is the point where I decided to package up and get the business on the market for my own personal reasons.\n\nIt’s so much that I learned from running a cleaning business, but these things are the most important that im about to share. \n\n**Live and die by your cleaners.**\n\nIt took me years to understand why the cleaners are the most important part of the business. When I started I thought you could just hire a cleaner by the snap of a finger and when I did that I almost lost every time. The cleaners are the backbone of the business. They are the make or break point. It’s necessary to appreciate when you come across great cleaners and keep them busy. Understand that when customers hire a cleaning service that’s a very serious buying decision for them. Imagine a customer books you, you send an unqualified cleaner and the customer is unhappy and never books with you again. That’s what happened with me until I started bringing on good talent.\n\nMany will say the most important aspects of the cleaning business are marketing and you need to focus on growing, but the hidden marketing lever is having some Vini’s and Itsmenia’s on your team. That’s what I had. I had cleaners that people knew and loved. When you have that you can almost hit a money glitch. Literally your business can grow through word of mouth the proper way. The cleaners were most important. It’s a grind at first but once you find that space cherish and respect it.\n\n**The power of niching is a great power!**\n\nWhen I first started the business I used Thumbtack, I used Yelp, I passed out flyers, I DID EVERYTHING! It all brought in clients. We did whatever because I was hungry and I needed to pay the bills. I didn’t have any other job, I did the cleaning business full time, so if you called we were going to clean it. It took me until about year 2 to understand the power of niching.\n\nWhen I finally understood, it’s like we hit another money glitch. Business got a little easier and we gained more money that made complete sense! I figured out which customer we were going to serve. We had services tailored only to their problems and aligned our systems towards solutions for only the problems they had. When I did this people found us vs us looking for them. When things got slow of course we always got back out there and took whatever that made sense, but we stayed true to the niche we chose and that’s when I started benefiting and growing the biz.\n\n**It will behoove you to become a local superstar!**\n\nIf you run any type of business and you get customers that are paying you cold hard cash and using your services or whatever you sell, pat yourself on the back! Because people online make it like getting customers in your business is easy the shit is not easy! It’s only when you finally crack it is when it becomes easy like playing a video game.\n\nWhat I realized is that you have to become a local superstar and get your business out there as much as possible. You need to shout and let everybody know what you got going on. IDC who it is because when you do, eventually you will become known for what you are doing. That’s what happened with me. I let everybody and their mother know about my cleaning business. Not only that, I invested heavily into my marketing skills.\n\nHere are the areas I can turn on with a push of a button (Facebook Ads, Google Ads and SEO, and Thumbtack and please don’t put me in a room full of people because I will get business from an event too). I will go over this in a moment. But becoming a local superstar and known for what you do is a compounding effort. If you take your business serious the support you get is the gift you receive from being undeniable. I lasted 5 years, you will be surprised how many people don’t even start. People will recognize you! People will need you and soon people will start calling you. It’s up to you to step to the plate and perform.\n\n**You need flow.**\n\nWhenever I expressed hardship in my business, my friend who runs a million dollar + landscaping business would always say fill up your pipeline. A pipeline in business does solve problems and should not be approached lightly. I will say you need to approach this as if someone is trying to take literal food from your loved one’s mouth. As if it’s life or death because truly if you aren’t getting customers you will eventually go flat. This means you need customers coming in from multiple areas.\n\nWhat I did was have paid ads and organic flows. For each area I put a system in place. I learned and put time into each area and it wasn’t all at the same time either. It started with the platforms like thumbtack, then I got decent with organic social media, decent with paid ads (FB &amp; Google Ads), then I met the Yoda of Online Marketing, SEO. I wasn’t good at the beginning but over time I got good at each stop, built a system around it and kept it going. I’m not saying go and do all of this because it’s time consuming.\n\nWhat I am saying is that each system that got built all went into either the residential pipeline or commercial pipeline. My main goal was to get new people in the doors that I can talk to. I kept my pipeline full! \n\nA glitch is letting people know about your cleaning business on stage at local events. I constantly went to business events around ATL and every chance I got I grabbed the microphone and introduced my business with everyone looking. At these events people have bumrushed me for my information, to the point where I had my iPad ready to collect info and sell on spot. Take that information and do with it what you will.\n\nThen I began to get the soulful nod that it was time for me to depart from the cleaning business. It was such a journey. I once read in a book that once you finally get your business to the point where it’s running without you and things change, you can become more motivated to continue to grow that business. Not me. I’m forever grateful to the cleaning industry and have no ill will towards it, but I was able to see that it was time to go elsewhere.\n\nThe journey led me to the stop to sell my business and on Nov 3rd, after months of work to sell the business, a contract was signed! At that moment the relief I felt was so reassuring that I hit a money dance! \n\nI’m so happy to have been in the industry and started my business journey here!\n\nFor all the cleaning business owners and aspiring, keep pushing! This is an industry that is in demand. A cleaning business is a business that can provide you with whatever you need during the time of your life. Need extra money? Pick up a few houses to clean. Want to build a multi million dollar cleaning business? You can literally sign a few contracts and be at a million with a cleaning business. It’s whatever you want it to be. Not saying it’ll be easy but the money is there!\n\n\n\nI wish you all luck! And if you read this far, thank you!",

I think a lot of people start businesses not because they “love people,” but because they hate bad incentives, bad managers, and pointless friction.\n\nWhat usually changes is *who* you’re dealing with. When it’s your own thing, the customers you keep are the ones you actually like working with, and you can design the work to minimize the interactions you hate. That alone makes it feel way lighter, even if the money isn’t crazy.\n\nThe downside is you end up wearing every hat, which can get exhausting in a different way. A lot of solo founders I know are fine with customers, but get burned out by the admin, follow-ups, and keeping everything straight.\n\nThat’s basically why we’re building Quorum (still beta). Not to make people “love business,” but to cut down the mental overhead so running solo doesn’t feel like juggling everything in your head all day.  \n[https://usequorum.app](https://usequorum.app)\n\nSounds like you found a version of work that fits you better, which honestly matters more than chasing some ideal outcome.",

At the beginning there’s momentum, ideas flying around, telling friends what you’re building. Then at some point it’s just you, your laptop and a long stretch of decisions no one else can really help you with.\n\nWhat surprised me is that the hard part isn’t motivation, it’s uncertainty. There’s no clear signal that you’re doing the right thing, just small indicators that might mean progress or might mean nothing. Some days you feel smart and capable, other days you wonder if you’re just confidently wrong. This really hit me recently when I was reviewing my numbers and remembered I have some money saved from rollingriches that gives me a bit of runway. Instead of feeling relieved, I felt the weight of responsibility. Every decision suddenly feels louder when it’s your own money, your own time, and no safety net telling you what to do next.\n\nI’m still committed, still building still learning but I didn’t expect the mental side to be this isolating. Curious how others deal with that quiet phase where you’re not failing, not winning, just grinding alone.",

And there are always ways to see if you are doing the right thing (listen to your users, get feedback earlier), and there are ways how to do right things instead of guessing: do only what you know your users want and ready to pay for. Never do if you are unsure, research first.\n\nAbout loneliness... I hear it over and over again... and it surprises me a lot. I dreamed about it when I was an employee: to be my own employer, decide what to do, when and why. And yes, I tell myself (therefore I'm kinda isolated too) but for some reason, I don't feel any isolation at all. Also, I have users that want this and that, which makes me feel less isolated.\n\nI'm talking about myself and you and many others are different and may feel really isolated. I may suggest you to  launch as soon as possible (even with a landing page before the real product launch), talk about your idea/product/website/whatever everywhere, get feedback as soon as possible - soon you will find people need your product/features and your isolation is gone. If not, and after publishing and talking you still feel isolated and lonely - maybe you picked up a wrong idea and people don't want to talk about it, to talk to you about it, discuss it, or suggest something to be implemented.\n\nAnyway, this stage is always presented but it 100% up to you to make it as short as possible.\n\nYeah, and one more hack: set up publicly or privately available metric page: users amount, or query or what else that show you: people use your product therefore they need you. I always look at my website and even if the first number is the same, the second number is bigger.\n\nGood luck!",

      "selftext": "I never thought that a decision made by Trump on the other side of the world could almost shut down my business. The story went like this. On August 19, we received an email from Omniva (Estonian Post): \"Starting tomorrow, we no longer ship parcels to the USA. Please find other delivery methods.\" August 20 is a public holiday in Estonia. The US accounts for about 60% of our wall decals shipments. We started looking for a solution urgently. We asked Omniva when it would be fixed. The answer: maybe 2-3 weeks, maybe 2-3 months. Meanwhile, sticker orders from America kept coming in.\n\nWe found a solution, though it wasn't pleasant. We decided not to turn off the US on marketplaces. On Amazon, Etsy, and eBay, everything depends on your rating. The more you sell, the higher you are in search results. Losing positions we built for years in one day would be a catastrophe. So, everything that used to go via Omniva, we started sending via FedEx. This is 3 times more expensive.\n\nA week later, the second blow came. All parcels generated before the 20th but handed over to Omniva afterward were returned. That was 70 packages. We finished September with a serious loss. Simply because delivery ate up everything. But we started to adapt.\n\nIt turned out that small stickers could be sent to the US in envelopes with a stamp they went through. This lowered costs slightly. In October, we managed to raise prices by about $5, fortunately, competitors did the same. The month ended with a small loss, but better than September.\n\nI want to clarify one thing: this was not the fault of the Estonian post (Omniva). Their systems were ready. The problem was on the US side, specifically with USPS, which was not technically ready to accept parcels, declare them, and process the data under the new regulations. It was a glitch in America, not Estonia.\n\nEvery week we were on calls with Omniva, waiting for news. And only in early November, after almost two months, Omniva finally reopened shipping to the US for business clients. We can exhale, but the price has gone up by about 1.5 times. Now, at least, it is clear what prices to set on marketplaces to work in the black again.\n\nMy conclusions:\n\nOn one hand, this political decision almost closed my business. On the other hand, thanks to this, we found new solutions, rebuilt our logic, and realized that as a team, we are ready for any surprises. A legitimate bonus: during this time, I made a great contact at UPS. They offered conditions better than FedEx in terms of both price and speed. We are already at the final stage of signing the contract.\n\nAlso, to minimize losses, we worked according to a \"silent\" algorithm: If an order came from the US, we packed it and put it on hold for 10 days. If Omniva didn't solve the issue in 10 days, we sent it via FedEx. If they did we sent it through them. Since the client has a standard delivery time of about two weeks, everything arrived on time.\n\nThat is the story.",

The fact that you kept selling, absorbed the cost hit, and found workarounds instead of panicking and shutting down shows serious grit. Most businesses would have frozen or just stopped US sales entirely, killing their momentum and rankings.\n\nThe \"hold for 10 days\" strategy is brilliant. You turned uncertainty into a tactical buffer without breaking customer expectations. And pivoting to FedEx/UPS while keeping marketplace rankings intact? That's the kind of decision that separates businesses that survive shocks from ones that don't.\n\nWhat stands out most is your mindset shift. Instead of blaming the policy or waiting passively, you treated it like a forcing function to optimize. Now you're stronger, with better carrier relationships and clearer pricing. That's how you build resilience.\n\nThanks for sharing the full breakdown. Stories like this are way more valuable than the usual \"growth hack\" content.

Scraping public information, running small paid tests, or talking directly to suppliers can offer surprisingly accurate insights at a low cost.\n\nIn practice, early businesses succeed not by having perfect data but by learning faster than their assumptions fail.

If exact data doesn't exist, find something close and extrapolate.\n* Pretend to be a customer. Sign up for competitor demos, ask sales reps questions, see what they pitch and how they price.\n\nThe dirty secret? Most founders are guessing with slightly better information than you.

The scam is paying $200/hr for someone who's really just a bookkeeper with a fancy title.\n\nHere's how to separate the two:\n\nWhat you're actually looking for: Someone who can build a cash flow forecast, model out scenarios, help you understand when you'll need capital before you're desperate for it. That's FP&amp;A work. If they can't talk about 13-week cash flow models or explain what your runway looks like under different growth scenarios, they're not a CFO.\n\nRed flags:\n\n* They only talk about \"cleaning up your books\" (that's bookkeeping)\n* No process for regular forecasting or financial planning\n* Can't explain how they've helped similar-stage companies\n* Want a huge retainer upfront with vague deliverables\n\nWhere to actually find them:\n\n* LinkedIn, but search \"fractional CFO\" + your industry specifically\n* Ask other founders at your stage, warm intros beat cold outreach every time\n* Local accounting firms sometimes have CFO-level people doing advisory work\n* SCORE mentors can point you toward legit people in your market\n\nThe Upwork ghosting thing is real. Most good fractional CFOs aren't hunting for gigs on Upwork, they're getting referrals.\n\nWhat's \"starting to make actual money\" mean in numbers? Like $300K? $800K? $1.5M? The answer changes what level of CFO you actually need, and whether you need full FP&amp;A or just someone to build you a cash flow system you can run yourself.",

          "body": "A good rule of thumb is that real fractional CFOs usually don’t need to hustle on marketplaces.\n\nThe safest paths are referrals through your accountant, CPA firm, or startup lawyer. They see who actually delivers versus who just talks. Established fractional CFO firms also tend to be more reliable because they have process, oversight, and reputational risk. You pay more, but you’re buying reduced downside.\n\nOn pricing, $200 per hour isn’t a scam signal, it’s closer to market for someone who actually understands cash flow, forecasting, and decision support. The red flag is someone cheap who claims they can “do everything,” or someone who jumps straight into dashboards without first understanding how money actually moves through your business.\n\nBefore hiring, ask very specific questions: what metrics they focus on at your stage, how they’ve helped companies avoid cash crunches, and what decisions they’ve influenced, not just reports they’ve built. A short paid trial or project-based engagement is also reasonable before committing longer term.\n\nIf you’re early and mainly need cash clarity, sometimes a strong FP&amp;A consultant or experienced controller is a better first step than a full fractional CFO title. Titles matter less than whether they can help you make better decisions with the cash you already have.",

I've talked to all the folks personally.\n\nMost are going to run more than 200/hr. A firm that does FP&amp;A/accounting/bookkeeping runs 2k-8k per month. The closer you are to pure bookkeeping, the lower on that range you land. Turning the crank on an FP&amp;A tool is a more value-added activity and will be closer to 8k than 2k. Fractional folks are going to be pricing off those benchmarks. They will generally be cheaper...but they generally don’t replace bookkeeping and accounting.",

Upwork can be hit or miss, especially for finance stuff.\n\nHonestly, the best fractional CFOs I've seen came through warm intros ask other founders in your space who they're using. If you're in any Slack communities or founder groups, drop a message there. Real recommendations beat cold hunting every time.\n\nAlso, don't sleep on LinkedIn search for fractional CFOs who've actually worked with startups at your stage. Look for people who post about cash flow, FP&amp;A, or fundraising. If their content makes sense and they're not spammy, shoot them a DM. The good ones are usually open to a quick call.\n\n$200/hr isn't wild if they actually know what they're doing and have startup experience, just make sure they can show you real examples of how they've helped companies like yours. If someone can't explain cash flow in plain English or dodges giving references, run.\n\nYou need someone who gets startups, not just big corp finance.

They usually come through **trusted referrals** from accountants, lawyers, investors, or other founders at a similar stage. Very low hourly rates are often a red flag; experienced CFOs typically charge a premium because they bring decision-level insight, not just bookkeeping.\n\nBefore hiring, it helps to be clear on what you actually need. Many early-stage companies don’t need a full CFO yet sometimes a strong controller or FP&amp;A consultant is a better, lower-risk fit. When you do speak to candidates, focus on real outcomes: how they’ve improved cash flow, supported fundraising, or built reporting systems, and always check references.\n\nIn short, avoid shortcuts, pay for experience, and hire through networks you already trust.",

From the outside it often looks like stupidity when it is actually context you do not see.\n\nThat said, if you genuinely cannot tolerate working under poor vision, the answer is not wait for a perfect idea. Almost nobody starts with one.\n\nWhat people in your position usually do successfully is this\nThey stop looking for a big company idea and start selling a narrow outcome they already know how to deliver. Consulting, contracting, freelancing, productized services. One problem, one customer type, one promise.

They only care if you can solve their problem and keep showing up.\n\nIf you cannot make money independently in a small way, founding a company will magnify the same frustration you already feel.\n\nStart small.

Just share tools or services you personally use or genuinely like. A lot of people on TikTok and YouTube are earning steady income this way, and once you understand how to place your links, it’s one of the lowest-effort income streams out there.\n\n2. Consulting.\nMost folks don’t realize how much their experience is actually worth. If you’ve spent years in any field : business, tech, creative work, ministry, fitness, whatever someone else is trying to learn what you already know. Offering simple consulting sessions can bring in quick income with very little setup.\n\n3. Digital courses.\nIf you can teach something step-by-step, you can create a small course. It doesn’t need to be complicated or long; it just needs to help someone solve a problem or get a result. Once it’s made, it can continue to generate revenue without you constantly working on it.\n\nAll three are beginner-friendly, affordable to start, and can be launched in a few weeks or less.",

Skills you might not see or value yet.\n* Starting a company means you'll deal with even more ambiguity and contradictions, except now it's all on you with no paycheck safety net.\n* \"I can't nail a good idea\" is a huge red flag. You don't need a world-changing idea, you need a real problem you're obsessed with solving.\n\nWhat to do:\n\n* Stay in your job but start building something small on the side. Test if you actually enjoy the entrepreneurial grind or just hate bad bosses.\n* If you're constantly frustrated, maybe the issue isn't the execs but the type of companies you're joining. Try a different stage or culture.\n* Work on finding a problem you care about deeply. Ideas come from obsession, not brainstorming sessions.\n\nEntrepreneurship won't fix frustration with authority, it'll just give you new, harder problems.

      "selftext": "I’ve failed five times trying to build a business. Not “almost worked” failures. Real ones.  \nThe kind where you spend months building, launching, and nothing happens, not even a single customer.\n\nOne thought kept coming back: **I didn’t fail because I was careless. I failed because I focused on the wrong certainty.**\n\nI’m a backend engineer with 10+ years of experience. So naturally, whenever I started something new, I focused on the technical part. Architecture. Clean systems. Edge cases.  \nIt felt productive, it felt safe, and that’s exactly why it became a problem.\n\nAcross those five attempts, the assumptions that hurt me the most were never technical. They were the ones I kept postponing because they were uncomfortable and unclear.\n\nThings like:\n\n* Will anyone actually care enough to pay for this?\n* Do people know this problem exists?\n* Am I building something people are already looking for?\n\nEach time, I told myself I’d test those later. After the product was “good enough”, after I felt confident, but later never really came.\n\nSo the hardest lesson for me wasn’t “build faster” or “market better”. It was this:\n\n**If you delay testing the riskiest assumptions, you’re not reducing risk. You’re just hiding from it.**\n\nWhat surprised me most is how easy it is to hide not from others, but from myself.  \nAs an experienced developer, the technical work felt safe and familiar. It gave me certainty, just not the kind a business needs.\n\nI’m still building. Just differently now. Curious: when something you built failed or succeeded, which assumption hurt the most when it turned out to be wrong demand, distribution, technical or something else?",

This ends up killing more MVPs before they become startups in our venture studio. \n\nAppreciate your transparency. I’m sure you’ll enjoy success if you stay on this path.",

As someone technical, I totally get the trap of \"I'll just build it really well first\" because execution feels safer than validation. But you nailed it: you're just postponing the uncomfortable questions that actually decide whether your business lives or dies.\n\nThe riskiest assumptions are always demand and distribution, not technical ones. Most of us can build something that works. Way fewer can build something people will pay for or even know how to find. And avoiding that reality by obsessing over clean code or perfect architecture is just fear dressed up as productivity.\n\nProps for owning this publicly. I've been guilty of the same thing, spending weeks on features nobody asked for instead of talking to real users early. The shift from \"build first, validate later\" to \"validate first, build just enough\" is brutal but necessary.\n\nThanks for sharing this.

A lot of founders go through this single, and it's tough because entrepreneurship already isolates you, then add being solo in life too and it compounds.\n\nHere's what helps:\n\n* Find other founders to talk to regularly. Not just for advice, but for the emotional side. Accountability groups, founder dinners, even online communities where you can vent and celebrate wins with people who actually get it.\n* Don't wait for a partner to feel supported. Build your own support system: mentors, friends who check in, therapist if needed. These relationships can fill the gap in different ways.\n* Celebrate your own wins, even the tiny ones. Being self-reliant is a huge strength, and you're building something meaningful on your own terms.\n* The right partner will show up when you're already thriving, not to fix the loneliness but to add to what you've built.\n\nYou're not alone in feeling this way. A ton of solo founders wish they had someone in their corner, but they keep going anyway. You're doing something most people are too scared to even start. That takes serious courage. Keep pushing, the right support will come.",

Since the pandemic, getting work at design agencies has become harder for me because they want extremely high-level experts. I’m good at what I do, but I’m not the best, so I focus more on working with local businesses in my city and trying to slowly scale my business.\n\nThis season was both the best and the worst. I had a lot of work, so I hired another freelancer to help me. The problem was that she kept making excuses for late deliveries. For the video editing work I hired her for, she ended up doing almost nothing, and what she did deliver was poorly done.\n\nI tried to help her by creating SOPs and putting in a lot of effort to make things work, but it didn’t. In the end, I had to redo everything myself for a client who was already upset, and I ended up losing that client. Because of all that rework, I fell behind with other clients, which caused some of them to hold my payments.\n\nRight now, I don’t have money. I let the freelancer go, but I couldn’t cover her last invoice, and now she’s threatening to sue me.\n\nI’m really sad. I know I’m not a big company, but things got out of hand, and I feel cornered from all sides.\n\nHas anyone else been through something like this?",

I never started my own ISP but I spent over a decade working at small independent ones around the Midwest and really understanding computer networking, tech support and all kinds of Telecom, jargon and work. I was able to make a decent living with that and build a lot of skills and networks both technical and social. \n\nI lived at home till I was 25. Then I rented a place for 2 years. Then I bought my own duplex where I live in one unit and I rent the other one out. I had that paid off in about 5 years with a 15-year mortgage rents. Just went up enough and I knew I'd always want to have a roof over my head. \n\nI worked on my tech consulting business. I kind of had a really minimal one for years. You can say I technically started when I was in high school cuz I started making money then but it was really sporadic. Maybe work every month or every other super tighty. I just kind of kept it small and sporadic but it grew organically over time but I didn't put a lot of money into this. I just would have stuff get reinvested I would buy like a tool kit from money that I had business cards, a domain name, a basic one-page website and then over time I got a larger ecommerce website but really the ecom website and the LLC and a lot of the bigger stuff. Even getting business insurance was post covid and a lot of that happened in 2022 and 2023. It was a long slow bird and I ended up refining into senior citizen tech support both in person and remote as well as senior centers and teaching classes. There teaching classes at the community college that I went to. I teach continuing Ed classes there now on computers and technology. So I just kept growing and going but this was always a side hustle. I had ideas on what I wanted to do when I was younger and luckily they were built on a sound foundation and I was able to explore them grow and turn dreams into reality. Hopefully you'll be able to do that too. I still have a day job but my plan is to have a fully self-supporting self-employed tech Business and the rental income and then I should be set financially.

So you can use those lessons to your advantage. \n\nIf you haven't realized it by now, you've validated for yourself that following the Internet hype when it comes to which businesses to do or start simply doesn't work. That's not something you were going to learn any other way other than by trying those businesses and failing at them. Which you did.\n\nWhat you need at this point is find ways to experiment with more radical ideas but in a very low-cost way. You say that you're currently building software that can help your business and others...that's excellent! Get that one or two businesses that will use it and let them help you improve on it with their feedback. You need to achieve something that Eric Ries calls validated learning in his book, The Lean Startup. What that is simply is crucial info that helps you understand your customer needs better and improve the product or pivot the business.\n\nWith this approach, you won't just be trying out different businesses hoping something works out. Instead, you will be building something that eventually helps someone or a business and that way you can create a sustainable revenue source and overall an entrepreneurial journey worth journeying long-term.\n\nIf your time allows, I suggest you read that book by Eric Ries (The Lean Startup) and supplement it with The New Business Road Test by John Mullins. Same way heroes in films can inspire action so can reading about successful entrepreneurs who lay it all about their beginnings and how they built their business.",

Hell, I left university and tried all kinds of business ideas, sales careers, online businesses, you name it, I tried it. And I didn’t half-ass it either, I went all in, 16 to 18 hours a day. I pushed myself so far that I ended up sitting in front of a psychologist, lost, burned out, depressed and stressed.\n\nEventually, I gave myself a break and got a normal job. Just for some time, I told myself, to breathe a little, maybe plan my next big idea, recharge and collect some energy.\n\nIt’s been two years since that decision and holy shit, am I happy.\n\nI deleted all that fake influencer social media crap and actually started living. Spending time with friends and family, got a girlfriend, and that “I’ll just take a break” turned into “fuck, why didn’t I do this sooner?”\n\nI feel so much peace, love and genuine happiness.\n\nWill I ever start a new business? I can’t say, you never know. But right now, I don’t even think about it. I’ll definitely sign up for university again and get a solid degree in a field I actually love.\n\nThe problem is that I, and most young wannabe entrepreneurs, want to start a business mainly because they love the idea of having money. And that’s where it ends before it even begins.\n\nThe second hard truth, not everyone is meant to be a successful entrepreneur, and that’s completely okay. You can still make great money with a normal job, have free time and travel the world, especially now, with remote work becoming more and more common.\n\nSo my advice is simple, take a break. Breathe. Spend time with people you love. Find a hobby or two. Chill the fuck out.\n\nYou have time.\n\nAnd if later you decide you want to start a business, do it then. Plenty of people started at 50, 60 or even later.\n\nMost importantly, sit down and ask yourself why you even want to be an entrepreneur. You’ll get more answers than you can imagine, and a much clearer path forward.\n\nWishing you all the best and peaceful holidays, brother ❤️",

Look at your own progression: dropshipping, pressure washing, software that solves real problems. That's not random thrashing, that's figuring shit out.\n\nThe issue isn't that you can't get things right. It's that you're building things that solve problems people have, just not problems they'll pay to solve. That's actually the last filter before product-market fit.\n\nHere's what I'd do if I were you, this is from experience:\n\nStop trying to \"come up with ideas\" for a month. relax that mental muscle. Instead, just notice what pisses you off at your day job. What manual task do you constantly do that feels stupid? What problems keeps happening? What report takes 2 hours that should take 5 minutes?\n\nBuild tools for yourself first. Use them for a few weeks. If they actually save you time, show your coworkers. If they start asking for it, you might have something.\n\nThe best businesses come from scratching your own itch, not scanning the market for opportunities (again experience). You've already proven you can build and learn - you just need to solve a problem you personally feel every week.\n\n Taking a break to recharge isn't quitting. It's smart. You can give 100% to your day job and keep your eyes open for real problems without forcing yourself to grind on side projects out of obligation. Sometimes the best ideas show up when you stop looking so hard. \n\n The universe tends to push away the things we feel we desperatly desire. Relationships, money, opportunities and the more we stress over them the furthur away they get creating a cycle. You can get off the track at anytime. Take a breth and regroup. What worked, what have I learned?  Even if its what NOT to do.  Everything is a step forward ESPECIALLY failure.  There is not 1 person who tried something for the first time and succeeded.  Every successful personhad to deal with failure of somekind.  The difference between the successful and the \"failure\" is the failure fails to push on.\n\n I'm working on it and with AI, anything is possible at the moment.

          "body": "Late 20s is honestly very early to be drawing conclusions about calling it quits, even though it doesn’t feel like it when you’re tired and fed up. What you’re describing doesn’t sound like someone who’s failed repeatedly, it sounds like someone who’s been searching without a stable base underneath them yet.\n\nOne thing I’d gently challenge is the idea that every attempt has to be the thing. Most people who eventually make it didn’t bounce from idea to idea until one magically worked, they anchored themselves in something boring and reliable first. A job, a trade, a skill, an industry. Then they built from inside that, not from the outside looking in. Random businesses are hard because you’re fighting on every front at once.\n\nThe pressure washer example is a good one. It didn’t fail because pressure washing is a bad business, it failed because you had no leverage yet: no experience, no reputation, no repeat customers, no pricing confidence. That’s not a character flaw, that’s just physics. The same applies to software. Solving a problem people won’t pay for usually means the problem is real, but the buyer, urgency, or positioning is wrong, not that you’re incapable.\n\nAlso, exhaustion is a signal, not a verdict. When you’re burnt out, your brain tells you stories like “I’m running out of time” and “I’m wired wrong”. Neither of those are facts. They’re what happens when effort hasn’t compounded yet. Compounding always looks stupid and pointless right up until it suddenly doesn’t.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with going all-in on a day job for a while if it buys you energy, skills, and financial breathing room. That isn’t quitting entrepreneurship, it’s regrouping. Some of the most dangerous advice out there is never give up without acknowledging that timing, positioning, and season of life matter.\n\nIf you are wired differently, that doesn’t mean you’re broken. It usually means you’re better suited to building something slowly, from depth, not chasing opportunities from the surface. Find one domain, one skill, one problem space you can sit in long enough to actually understand. Let boredom work in your favour.\n\nYou don’t need a big idea right now. You need rest, stability, and one small win that proves to you that effort can turn into results. From there, ideas show up on their own.",

I am 49 and have been at the entrepreneurial game since I was 20.  Still did not launch something that generated life-changing $ but had one exit, several side-gigs that generated passive $$$ and plenty of lessons learned.  The key is to progress, even if it is in baby steps.  If you’re tired or need a break, simply get a 9-5 than let the ideas come to you, the key is to let them just flow in, without forcing them, than turn them into a side hustle, rince and repeat until something shows promising potential.

For example, my customers hated when I used AI outreach tools to send super personalized outreach messages! Instead they seem to prefer simple short messages instead even if it's not personalized! That said, there are a few that has totally improved our team! Here are the ones I can think of:\n\n1. Gamma: After every Zoom meeting, we have an automation where Gamma can create an presentation that I can share with my clients all by itself\n2. Google Nano Banana is super impressive! I can basically simple click an image of any product I sell and turn into professional photoshoots! Basically I have used Nano Banana itself to generate 2-3 AI generated humans for my brand! Then I use the product photo and image of the the AI generated humans to create professional and consistent photos that are often better than ones I used to get after professional photoshoots with freelancers!\n3. Perplexity: We do use ChatGPT for most things but I really like the perplexity feature where I can setup an automation daily to send me updates in my industry based on news! They are a little better for real time data!\n4. Surfer: We have an automation where the tool looks at our Google search data to automatically come up with a strategy and auto publishes blogs on our website to improve our ranking! It can auto embed your products, case studies in blogs, and automatically share the blog on all your socials! Pretty cool!\n5. Lovable: We again have an automation where every time we create a new ad, we get a fully custom landing page that matches our primary theme and landing page! Massively helped our conversion rates!\n\nFollowing to see what others have said :)",

Once I started reusing my best performing emails, tightening targeting to actual decision makers, and properly tracking replies, response rates improved way more than just sending more volume.\n\nI ended up using a lightweight internal setup (I use Contact Intel for this now) because most tools I tried either dumped data or leaned too hard on generic AI instead of helping you learn what’s actually working. The real win wasn’t automation, it was clarity.\n\nBig takeaway this year for me: fewer emails, better targeting, and learning from what already works beats blasting more messages every time.",

          "body": "I think you’re already ahead of a lot of people just by questioning it. The online “hustle” culture massively oversells the upside and barely mentions the trade-offs. Running a business can be brilliant, but it’s not freedom by default especially at the start. You usually swap one boss for many, income is inconsistent, the stress follows you home, and when something breaks it’s on you. There are long stretches where you’re working harder than you ever would in a job and wondering why you didn’t just take a stable salary.\n\nThat said, if you genuinely enjoy problem-solving, responsibility, and building something over time, it can be deeply satisfying in a way employment often isn’t. The real win isn’t “easy money” or flashy success, it’s autonomy, learning at speed, and eventually designing a life that suits you but that only comes after years of uncertainty and mistakes. Starting a podcast to learn and talk to owners is actually a smart, low-risk way to see the reality up close. If you go in with eyes open and accept that it’s hard, boring, stressful *and* rewarding, you’re much more likely to do well than someone chasing the Instagram version of entrepreneurship.",

      "selftext": "Hey, I’m a 30F co-founder. I'm looking for an advise (please be kind, i'm in a very bad mental condition). \n\n I built this company together with my one friend eight years ago. The business had been running well until we started experiencing a bad performance  this year (first couple of years wasnt good but we did survived at least). It's a midsized company. \n\nLast year, we missed our target by a small margin. This year, however, we were expecting significant growth. Instead, we achieved about 75% of our target, which roughly the same performance as last year. Over the past few months, our performance has continued to decline. Based on data, it also appears that the market seems to be be declining. Fyi we only make slim profit annually (5~10% of revenue). \n\nWe have angel investors as shareholders, and carrying that responsibility has become a HUGE mental burden. They are pushing for aggressive high growth and encouraging us to raise a much larger round with unrealistic valuation. At the same time, i'm not confident that we’re ready for that level of fundraising. I don’t feel prepared for the added burden, and i dont have a solid or responsible plan for capital utilization yet.\n\nThis tension has been extremely stressful for me.\n\nSince 2024, my personality has changed a lot, especially this Q3-Q4. I’ve lost a significant amount of weight, often find myself zoning out, keep forgeting small things, and feel anxious almost all the time. I’ve gradually cut off much of my social life, and mentally, i even anxiety disorder and mild depression. I barely feel happy and struggle to sleep at night because my mind keeps looping around: what if my business fails? It kil*s me. \n\nI’ve been running this business for years, and I feel deeply tired. Part of me wants to quit, but i dont know what the right or responsible next step looks like.\n\nI’m wondering:\n\n1. Is it possible for a CEO (me) to step away from their own company?\n2. If selling the business isnt realistic (its a service based company, i dont think its possible to sell), what are practical and responsible ways to transition leadership or pass the business on in a way that’s safe for everyone involved?\n\nI’d really appreciate insights from anyone who has been through something similar. Thank you :)",

So just something to suggest here.\n\nEntrepreneurs in my circle and I are also strong proponents of the use of psychedelics, both microdoses for daily recovery and single macro doses for year-long restoration, to address major swings in mood and depression.

If someone else can do it 80% as good as me I give them the task and move on to the next set of challenges.  At this point only our 3-4 largest customers even know who I am.  Most of our customers have never met me or even seen my name on anything.  That’s not because I don’t care it’s because I know I can’t run a business if it relies on me for everything and customers know if they know the CEO they will call the CEO.  I’m here if escalation is needed but otherwise my people can handle that, many of them are better than me at the thing they do now anyway.  This means that the first few years I paid myself next to nothing so I could afford another person.  I’ve usually not been the highest paid employee on payroll but figured my equity made up for that and was more tax efficient anyway.  \nI burn out frequently but I’ve gotten better at seeing it coming.  Getting to the gym for even 20 min a day 3-5 times a week and getting 7 hours of sleep each night are non negotiable for me.  I protect myself.  I don’t work weekends anymore.  I use the analogy of flights attendants. You need to put the oxygen mask on yourself before you can help others.  Take a vacation and you’ll be shocked how everyone steps up while you’re gone.  For 3 years I never took more than a 4 day weekend off.  When I finally took a full week and was not reachable (in a remote area backcountry hiking), I came back to find out that everything was fine and my team leveled up and didn’t actually need me for everything like they seemed to previously.  \nYour job is to de risk the business.  If everything relies on a single person that’s a very risky business and I personally would not invest in it unless there was a plan to change that quickly.  If the founder got hit by a bus my investment would go to zero.",

          "body": "I’m really sorry you’re going through this. First thing I want to say, very clearly, is that what you’re describing is not weakness or failure, it’s burnout under sustained pressure. Eight years of responsibility, investor expectations, slim margins, and a changing market will do this to almost anyone. The physical symptoms you’re describing are your body waving a big red flag, not you not coping well enough.\n\nYes, it is absolutely possible for a CEO to step away from their own company. It happens far more often than people admit, especially in founder-led businesses. Being a founder does not mean you are morally or professionally obligated to sacrifice your health indefinitely. You are a human first, a CEO second. Stepping back can be temporary or permanent, and it doesn’t automatically mean the business collapses or that you’ve let anyone down.\n\nBefore making any irreversible decisions, I’d strongly suggest separating three things in your mind: the business, the investors, and your health. Right now they’re tangled together, which is why everything feels unbearable. Your health is non-negotiable. No exit, pivot or turnaround is worth long-term damage. If you can, speak to a professional about the anxiety and depression side of this. That’s not a business decision, that’s basic self-preservation.\n\nOn the practical side, if selling isn’t realistic, there are still options. You can step into a reduced role rather than disappearing overnight. That might mean appointing or hiring an operational lead or general manager and moving yourself into a board-level or strategic position. Many service businesses run this way, even if founders assume they have to be hands-on forever. It’s not an all-or-nothing switch.\n\nAnother option is having an honest reset conversation with investors. Not a pitch, not a growth fantasy, but a grounded discussion based on data and reality. You’re allowed to say you are not comfortable raising a large round without a clear plan, and that forcing growth in a declining market could destroy the company rather than save it. Good investors will listen. \n\nIt’s also okay to consider winding things down in a controlled, responsible way if that’s where this leads. There is dignity in an orderly transition that protects staff, customers and your sanity. Businesses don’t have to explode or IPO to be valid. Survival itself is not a moral obligation if it costs you everything.\n\nLastly, please don’t make life-altering decisions while you’re this depleted. Exhaustion narrows your thinking and makes every future look catastrophic. Get support around you. You’ve carried this for a long time on your own.\n\nWhatever you decide, stepping back does not erase the eight years of work, resilience and value you’ve already created. You are not your company, and you don’t owe it your health.",

Therapy, medical evaluation, whatever you need. This is more having the mental clarity to make good decisions rather than just self-care.\n\nYou don't have to choose between \"keep pushing\" and \"quit entirely.\" There's a third path: honest conversation with your co-founder and investors about what this business actually is and can be. Maybe it's a sustainable, profitable mid-sized company rather than a venture-scale rocket ship. Maybe your investors' expectations need recalibration. Maybe you step into a different role. But you can't figure this out while you're drowning.\n\nHaving done it myself, stepping back from daily operations is not abandonment but often the most responsible  move. Not that it's easy, but if you need space to think clearly, bring in a COO or trusted operator. You don't disappear. You lead from elsewhere.\n\nGo read \"Crucial Conversations\" then have a real conversation with your co-founder. Then with your investors. Not to convince them of anything but to understand what's actually negotiable.",

Even if they steal it and takes you years to get paid/justice, its better than losing everything AND not getting anything for it. \n\n2. If you can't protect it, then find a way to improve the product or your marketing/positioning. theyre a huge conglomerate and presumably late to the space and have to update any manufacturing/marketing/legal/ other large corporate shenanigans. use that time to get ahead and build your moat/customers. flood the market (assuming its a profitable product/market) and get those sales before they do. if they are a billion dollar company itll be like moving those big shipping container ships, its gonna take some time. use that to your advantage. who knows if you flood the market and the product is great they may even buy you out even if they have their own product in the pipeline. if the buyer is a product guy, he still has to convince his management, and the chain of command, etc. Meeting after meeting after meeting, just to agree then finally source, design, test, manufacture, etc.",

It isn't some exploration or journey or community building experience. It's a service.

Or more accurately, the one logo you liked best out of the many many many logos you can have it make you to choose from. Or the AI logo you then tweaked a little.

It being made by a human does not effect that.\n\nHere is your genuine question.  \nShow me an unbiased study comparing AI to human logo and how they performed differently all things otherwise created equally.

I do embroidery and I can spot an ai-generated logo in a second, and they’re terrible. They have this uncanny valley sort of “somethings just slightly off” look most of the time, and it’s usually because of the text because it’s not made with a coherent font, instead it’s usually that each letter is generated individually and there’s minute differences between repeats of the same letter. \n\nI don’t mind so much when people are using it for a random logo for something that isn’t meant to generate profit. But when it’s for a business, it looks incredibly unprofessional to me. Even more frustrating is how many business owners make up a logo and then don’t save a high quality version of it. I often get sent off-kilter pictures of a printout, or a blurry low res version, or anything but the original file. \n\nI hired a designer (semi-local to me) to make my logo, and they nailed it. It cost me a whole $150. Good investment as far as I’m concerned. I know expenses are tight when you’re starting out but considering the impact a good logo makes, that’s a pretty small investment. And not everyone even really needs a full blown logo either. Your business name in a nice looking font is enough for a lot of businesses out there. It doesn’t make you less official.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m a small business owner in the beauty industry (cosmetic tattooing / brows) and I’m looking for advice on how to handle a situation that has escalated beyond normal customer service.\n\nA 19-year-old client booked and received a permanent brow service. The pricing, policies, and consent forms were clearly disclosed and signed. During the appointment, I checked in multiple times, and the client specifically requested a very minimal result. I initially did more and removed strokes at her request. She also has a complimentary touch-up included if she wants additional fullness.\n\nPayment was made using her mother’s credit card (the service was a gift).\n\nAfter the appointment, the client herself did not contact me. Instead, her mother texted me angrily saying the price was “ridiculous,” called my business a scam, and said she was filing a chargeback. I submitted a full evidence packet (signed consent forms, before/after photos, appointment details, policies, etc.), and it appears the bank ruled in my favor.\n\nNow, after the bank decision, the mother has escalated. She has contacted me again - from a different phone number - demanding a refund within 48 hours and threatening:\n\n- Posting negative reviews and “blasting” my business on Google, Facebook, and Instagram\n- Reporting me to the BBB\n- Reporting me to state licensing boards\n- Using “connections” in the industry to harm my business\n\nShe has framed all of this as contingent on me issuing a refund.\n\nI have not heard from the actual client at all, and I have remained professional and brief, redirecting communication to the client herself.\n\nAt this point, this feels less like a service dispute and more like harassment or extortion. I have saved all messages and have not refunded.\n\nMy questions:\n1. Should I reach out to the client via phone call to understand the situation?\n2. Should I reply to the mother?\n3. What should my next steps be?\n4. Has anyone dealt with something similar after winning a chargeback?\n\nI’m trying to handle this correctly and not make things worse. Any advice from business owners or legal-minded folks would be appreciated.\nThank you.",

We require them to agree to them at multiple stages including deposit, trip application and every addition payment, usually 2 additional times. We’ve never lost a charge back because we follow the guidelines to a ‘T’, like you and are always threatened with negative online reviews, I’m going to tell all my friends, etc. and they’ve never had an impact.

Start processing today. No real checks.\n\n2. Shortly after, they say funds must be held “for security reasons” while you continue operating normally.\n\n3. You are encouraged to keep selling. Your balance grows. Stripe is happy to let it pile up.\n\n4. The moment funds are due for release, surprise. They suddenly need “additional documentation.”\n\n5. You submit everything requested. IDs, business records, invoices, proof of delivery, everything.\n\n6. After that, Stripe decides they “can no longer service your account” due to vague fraud concerns.\n\n7. They freeze the entire balance indefinitely “in case of chargebacks” and keep the money.\n\n8. Stripe claims they will refund customers. In reality, refunds often never happen.\n\n9. To protect your reputation, you are forced to tell customers to file chargebacks themselves.\n\n10. Stripe then points to those chargebacks as proof that they were right all along.\n\nFull circle. Self-fulfilling justification.\n\nThe reality is this. The account was fine. The transactions were real. The only thing Stripe did consistently was hold customer money while earning interest and shifting all risk onto the merchant.\n\nIf Stripe truly believed the activity was fraudulent, refunds would be issued immediately. Instead, funds sit. Customers wait. Businesses get destroyed.\n\nMore and more investigators are starting to recognize this pattern for what it is. This isn’t “risk management.” It’s systematic fund retention disguised as compliance.\n\nThis will come back around. And when it does, Stripe won’t be able to hide behind boilerplate emails and trust-and-safety buzzwords anymore.\n\nIf you’ve experienced this, speak up. Silence is exactly what lets this continue.",

          "body": "This pattern is real, but I think it’s less a secret “fraud playbook” and more a structural failure that hits small operators disproportionately.\n\nStripe isn’t actually deciding whether you’re honest or not. Their risk systems are deciding whether your business is *legible under stress*. When something trips a flag, the question isn’t “were these transactions real?” It’s “can this merchant produce a clean, auditable narrative fast enough that our internal confidence threshold clears?” Most can’t — not because they’re doing anything wrong, but because their ops live across inboxes, spreadsheets, Stripe metadata, and half-documented workflows.\n\nAt that point, the default outcome is account offboarding. Holding funds isn’t malicious so much as the path of least internal risk. It looks predatory from the outside because the merchant has zero leverage and no way to reduce uncertainty once the decision process starts.\n\nThis also isn’t unique to Stripe. PayPal, Square, Shopify Payments all behave similarly once volume or velocity crosses a line. The common failure mode is the same: founders are running real businesses, but their operational proof is fragmented.\n\nThis is one of the reasons we’re building Quorum (still in beta): not as a payments alternative and definitely not a magic fix for Stripe, but as infrastructure so businesses aren’t scrambling when a platform suddenly asks them to “prove legitimacy.” Centralized customers, jobs, invoices, inventory, fulfillment — basically making your operation readable instead of reconstructing it under pressure.\n\nIt doesn’t solve the power imbalance, but it can shrink the blast radius.  \nFor anyone curious: [https://usequorum.app](https://usequorum.app)",

      "selftext": "Hello, the title hopefully clearly describes my situation. I purchased a business 5 months ago and have been discovering that there are customer accounts that show a total of nearly $150k in credit. \n\nCustomers paid a deposit toward the purchase of items that needed to be ordered prior to my ownership of the business, and I have been completing the sale of these items since then using the \"credit\" that they have on their accounts. There was no bank account included in the sale of this business, so there is essentially no money supporting the sales that are made with credit.\n\nIf this isn't making sense, I'll add some numbers and dates. \nLet's say that a customer wanted to purchase an item with MSRP of $10k on August 1st. The item wasn't in stock and had to be ordered, so the customer paid a $5k deposit on August 1st, the credit is added to their customer account and the item was ordered. I purchased the business on September 1st, previous owner said there was no business bank account (which seemed likely enough). On September 15th, the item arrives, customer is notified and comes in pays the remaining $5k of the $10k and takes the item. So essentially I only actually get $5k from this sale. The kicker is that I get a bill for the item on October 1 for $6k (the cost of the item), so now I actually lost $1k from the sale. This scenario happens dozens of times in slightly different variations.\n\nThe point of sale software shows $0 on August 1st and $10k on September 15th (even though the money actually hit the bank on the 1st) so I assumed it was all good on the 15th.\n\nMany items were ordered and sold, and it has taken me a long time to understand what has occurred. \n\nWhat do I do now? How do I recover the money?\n\nOne more thing, I'm paying for the purchase.of the business over time, the seller essentially financed that sale, so I figure I should be able to subtract the $150k from what I still.owe on the purchase... Right?\n\nEDIT: **The other part of this is that I worked for the business as an employee before I purchased it from the owner, so I saw that we were successful and knew that it was making good money, though I had no way of seeing the true financials in my role.",

Be humble, be gracious, seek common ground.\n\nAsk to sit down and go through all of the current outstanding orders, and have him tell you which ones he collected deposits on, and how much on each.\n\nTell him you've learned these should have been on his books as unearned revenue liabilities.  Also tell him that you've discovered through research that usually businesses are sold with a working capital adjustment, which is a post-closing true-up to adjust the purchase price.  An average working capital target (current assets minus current liabilities) should have been negotiated as part of the purchase price.\n\nWhen buying a business, buyers write two checks: the purchase price (or down payment) and a working capital deposit into the new business bank account.\n\nFor example, had you set a working capital target before closing and a customer comes in between the target set date and the closing, and paid a $10,000 deposit, and the target is $0, the price should be adjusted by $10,000 in your favor, since the seller takes home the $10,000 and you have to fund it.\n\nI know this is a lot but try this and comment back if you need help.

          "body": "What you’re running into isn’t a POS glitch. It’s a timing and ownership issue that just wasn’t visible before.\n\nThose customer deposits weren’t revenue. They were liabilities. The business owed customers either product or a refund. When you bought the business without the cash that came with those deposits, you inherited the obligation but not the money that funded it.\n\nSo in your example:\n\nCustomer pays $5k deposit before you own the business\n\nThat $5k should have been sitting in cash, offset by a customer credit liability\n\nYou didn’t receive that cash at purchase\n\nWhen you complete the sale, you collect the remaining $5k, but you still pay the full $6k vendor bill\n\n\nThat’s why it feels like you “lost” money on each sale. Economically, the loss already existed at purchase — it just shows up over time as you fulfill those orders.\n\nA few important points:\n\n1. You generally can’t recover this from customers. They already paid what they owed.\n\n\n2. This is something to raise with the seller, because those customer credits should have been addressed in the purchase price or paid out at closing. It’s very common for this to be handled as a purchase price adjustment.\n\n\n3. No, you shouldn’t unilaterally subtract $150k from what you owe without talking to a lawyer or CPA, but yes — conceptually, this is exactly the kind of issue that gets netted against seller financing if the contract allows it.\n\n\n4. Going forward, you should track customer deposits explicitly as a liability so this stops being invisible.\n\n\n\nYou didn’t suddenly discover that the business “wasn’t profitable.” You discovered that part of the balance sheet didn’t come with the sale. That’s a painful realization, but it’s also a solvable one once it’s clearly identified.",

First I would ask your vendor connections for insight on your venue.  If you dont have vendor friends (luxury planners and photographers)  that's your problem ! The wedding industry is built on customer service relationships. Reach out to the ones you liked working with the most in the last 2 years. They are the ones referring your clients !\n\nSometimes brides will book planners and photographers before they book their venue ! So make sure your venue is on their most - requested list.\nIf you dont have that start here....\n\n-Does your space need updates?  (Lighting, ease of use, parking , electrical , LANDSCAPING - genz brides want lots of places to take pictures. Make sure no area looks old and shitty ..historic is great, outdated and crumbling is not.) \n\n-Is your bridal suite amazing (open space with natural lighting and cozy furniture)  - this is where the future brides can imagine themselves getting ready with their closest friends - this is a big selling point. Consult with beauty vendors in your area!\n\n- is your venue difficult to work with ? (No good rain plan area, limited time to access, bad parking for guests, awkward layout for the wedding  ) \n\n- does it come with good catering?  Do brides have to pay for every small thing or do you include a lot?\n\nIs your venue able to accommodate other groups such as showers, parties , dinners ? Many venues in my area offer \nBrunches and special dinners (holidays ) to bring in off season money.\n\n\nYour seo and marketing might be good in paper but are you looking at your venue as a bride ? Would you drop 30k on your venue ? Maybe go tour your competition and see what they offer. \n\nWedding venues should make absolutely bank. The most successful in my area do 3 weddings per weekend in our busy season - fri/sat /sun,  have amazing catering and charge $30k-45k base . Depending on your area you might get 6 months of busy season and if you have a nice indoor options you could operate in the \"off season \" 12 months a year.",

Trivia nights, game nights (if you have outdoor space something like a cornhole tournament with local breweries) or whatever hobbies the twenty something’s are into.

This is my first comment on something in small business sub. \n\nYour situation is likely a marketing and customer relations issue.\n\nSaying the market has changed or slowed or what ever is a cop-out. Market conditions are always changing and it’s the owner/operators job to predict and plan for every scenario. As an entrepreneur you’re always going to have times where you’re flying a little to close to the sun. \n\nSo in this situation I would ask - who is your target customer and how do you get in front of them? \n\nWell the question is nuanced because who is the real decision maker? The groom? The bride? The planner? The mother of bride? The person who’s paying for it? … every situation is different. \n\nBut there is one thing that is constant… the planner. If you want consistency in your business you need to build airtight relationships with all the planners in the area so that when they do a venue presentation you’re always on the list. \n\nBut how do you do that? Well here is the “fun” part. You have to work the phones and door knock. Small gifts work too once you have a budding relationship. Pick the top 100 planners and make it your mission to get in contact with all of them over the next 30 days. Sometimes it means showing up to their office or phone calls or mailers. And make sure to build a deep personal relationship when you have a planner on-site. Also - All this has to be you - very important - can’t hire this out. \n\nLast thing is the planners are going to ask “what’s in it for me”. As you know most planners take a percentage of vendor sales which is often disclosed in the contract with the client. Figure out appropriate incentives for the planners based on the industry standard.\n\nThis is the hard target market that nobody wants to work. Much harder than buying an ad or writing an SEO page. Well in business that’s where the money is  - the boring hard stuff",

You do look to be next to an apartment complex, which is good. Can you add a soda fountain, look into starting a coffee part of the business, or something else? Is there another niche that fits in with candy that you can add? \n\nAlso, you might want to consult an interior designer. When I’m buying from a locally owned store, I like it cozy and like to have lots of stuff to look at. This gives convenience store vibes and doesn’t really encourage browsing so much as driving in to buy one thing you want that you can’t get elsewhere. \n\nYour concept may need some tweaking if you want this to be sustainable. \n\nLastly, free samples are a great way to boost sales. If someone tries something they find out they like and then they buy it for many years to come, that’s bank for you. Can you open a new candy every day, cut it into bite-size pieces, and (don’t forget to list allergens) give those out? Make it a thing on social media with a calendar so that people know what day you’re opening what bars so if they want to try something specific, it draws them in.",

And that website lists 5 services that don't match the offer. Now the lead is lost and they bounce.\n\nI saw this recently with someone running ads for legal coaching. His ad had a click-through rate that you'd think would generate a 4x or so return on ad spend. But he was barely at 2x. Not at all terrible but was definitely missing out.\n\nWith a separate landing page just for the coaching, the same ad started to perform at a 3x. \n\nThe disconnect is expensive. You're paying for clicks on a specific offer, then confusing people when they land.\n\nIf you're advertising coaching, the landing page should only show coaching. If you're advertising meal prep, only show meal prep.\n\nIt should be this simple:\n\n* What is your offer?\n* Does the page you're sending them to deliver ONLY that thing?\n\nIf not, make a simple landing page first. Even a basic one-pager should perform better than a generic homepage. ",

When I say small, I mean we do everything “office” related from home since there’s no office in the salon. \n\nWe have several reports that we reference that have taken years to populate with sales data. Over 50 documents in Excel and Word that represent hundreds of hours of data entry and analysis. I use these reports to make my cash projection, coach my staff, make purchasing decisions: the list is endless.\n\nStarting in 2024, we used office 365 exclusively for these reports since my front desk manager and I do this work from our home computers and it was the most simple and reliable for up to date access. I mistakenly assumed that because the documents were in the cloud, this was the equivalent of having a backup.\n\nThis August, Microsoft had a problem processing my credit card on file for the annual fee (it had expired) and instead of notifying any of us on the app when we used the documents,  they sent two emails in November that looked like spam notifying me that the account was about to be cancelled. I opened the email, figured out the problem, and updated the payment info. Microsoft charged me on November 16.\n\nThe next day, November 17th, all of our documents were gone. All of them. \nI’ve spent the last 3 weeks on a series of calls with offshore support people that hang up on me when I ask to speak with a supervisor. The first week they charged me again, opened a ticket, and then called me several mornings at 7 AM to tell me they were working on it.\n\nMore phone calls, more hangups. Yesterday I found another phone number for tech support, and got someone on the phone that explained to me that all of those people had been trying to tell me that my documents were gone. \n\nObviously I should have been backing them up separately but I mistakenly thought by using the cloud system, I was.  Recreating these will take my front desk manager and I hours. This was another painful lesson in small business ownership that I had to learn by f**king up. \n\nTL:DR:\nI used Microsoft Office 365 for cloud storage and they lost over 50 Excel and Word documents that took is years to create.\n\nEdited to add: Thanks everyone for telling me I should have backed up the cloud, I agree. It's helpful to hear how everyone has their backups established. Moving forward I'll have something better set up. To me, the most painful part of being the owner of a small business is having to be an expert in everything, and when you fall short it's potentially catastrophic.",

          "body": "This data transfer nightmare is so common with scaling businesses! The tools that help you grow often don't talk to each other, and you end up spending hours on manual imports/exports.\n\nI had the same issue with different tools for customer management, inventory, and marketing. Built Kairos (my AI assistant) to handle exactly this kind of workflow integration:\n- Automatically exports data from Tool A\n- Reformats it for Tool B's requirements  \n- Imports and reconciles any conflicts\n- Runs daily to keep everything in sync\n- Sends me a summary of what was processed\n\nThe game changer is that Kairos can work with any tools through their web interfaces - it doesn't need official API integrations. It literally clicks through your sourcing tools and business software like a human would.\n\nFor eBay arbitrage specifically, I've seen it handle inventory updates, profit calculations, and listing optimization across multiple platforms. Would save you hours daily and eliminate the manual error risk.",

The only setups I’ve seen work reliably were either light API connectors people built themselves or using a middleware layer to sync just the essentials. Funny enough, even in other areas like sales ops (stuff like SalesEcho comes to mind), teams end up solving the same “tools don’t talk to each other” problem with a connector instead of waiting for native integrations. It’s annoying, but it’s usually the only scalable fix.",

The first time we visited the owner introduced himself, showed up to our table, recommended dishes, and overall made for a very pleasant experience. The restaurant is a bistro with very nice e decorations and cool jazz music in the background that was low enough for guests to hear themselves while speaking.\n\nOur second visit was a much different experience. No owner, no recommendations, and semi-attentive waitresses (all college age) that gave cursory service; but the worst of all was rap music being played very loud to a level where it was hard to hear anything at all. \n\nMy opinion is that the waitresses/cook/ staff changed the music and arrangements to what they liked, notwithstanding what the customers would like. \n\nAs a small business, it should be paramount to present a pleasant atmosphere that draws in customers.

It doesn't matter if it is a single or a multiple, the benefit of a LLC doesn't depend on how many members, but how it is being operated.

They ask a few simple questions and then walk you through it. I imagine most states will have a similar thing. \n\nSecond most affordable is legalzoom and maybe will give you extra peace of mind/ease, so although they will upcharge you, it’s way less than a lawyer. \n\nLastly $1800 is actually a pretty affordable quote if you do want to go that route.

      "selftext": "Hello, I’m new here. My name’s Gary. I’m in my late 50s and, to put it bluntly, **I feel ‘stuck’ inside my own business**. At the risk of sounding defeatist, I feel like I’m in a fun-free loop, grinding slowly towards failure.\n\nFor over a decade I’ve run my own small video production company. I stumbled into it after being made redundant following the Financial Crisis. At first it felt exciting and full of possibility: travel, interesting projects, big hopes for creative freedom and financial stability. But over time, the reality has drifted a long way from the dream.\n\nThe industry changed faster than I could adapt, with bigger agencies moving into *my* small pond, more companies built in-house content teams, and now artifical blah blah blah intelligence has reached the point where large parts of our work can be done with a laptop and a few prompts, for peanuts. I’m working harder and harder for less reward, with shrinking creative freedom and a lower and lower ceiling on what the business could realistically become. It’s know it’s not going to be enough to give me the future I was hoping for. \n\nSomewhere along the way, this stopped feeling like something I chose and now feels like something I’m chained to. The only future I can see at the moment is bleak: a worn-out version of me, grinding away into my 60s and beyond, unable to retire properly and too tired to keep going. Ten years of sunk effort makes walking away feel like failure — but struggling on feels just as hopeless, to be honest. \n\nIs this a midlife crisis? I’m not sure. But, I worry about trying to find salaried work at my age. I spent ten years in recruitment advertising as an art director, so I can speak with authority when I say that going back into full-time employment and earning what I need in my late 50s is unrealistic. Objectively speaking, the fear is real.\n\nMaybe this is the 21st century reality for a lot of people at my age, who feel boxed in by the lives they’ve tried to build. Anyway, it’s how I feel right now, so I’m asking — genuinely:\n\n**Is anyone else going through something like this?**\n\n**Do you feel stuck in your career or business?**\n\n**How are you thinking about your future?**\n\n**Have you found any direction — or do you feel as stuck as I do, whether you’re in a salaried job or running your own thing?**  \n  \nThanks for taking the time to read.  \nAny shared thoughts will be truly appreciated.",

I'm the last man standing at my small family business in the sense that everyone that was with me when we started my stone engraving company has either died or left.  I've got a great guy over on the production end, and my mom essentially volunteers for us full time and my wife gets a steady paycheck handling our customers.  I haven't gotten paid more than I need to survive at any point in the last 20 years.  I do our stone purchasing, handle payroll, do all of our designs, all of our deliveries, and I cut our sandblast stencils.  I LOVE what we do.  Our customers love us and we put everything we've got into our product.  \n\nWe just have so much baggage.  My brother was in charge for years and he was more interested in going out drinking on the company debit card than he was in running the business.  He drank us into some deep debts with bad business decisions and consistently running up a hundred dollar tab every night if not more, plus multiple trips to Jack In The Box to sop up the booze.  If he showed up by 11:30am I'd almost count that as being on time, and then usually he was off to the 'office store' by 2pm, which was code for going to the bar.  He stopped paying some of our suppliers, our landlord and our tax debts and verbally abused me into a shell of myself over the years.  In January 2020 he didn't show up to work and I had to break into his apartment to find him dead and naked on the floor of his bedroom.  It broke me.  I've been dealing with a lot of PTSD and anxiety issues since then.  I disappeared into my own hole of drugs and alcohol for a few years before snapping out of it.\n\nIt took me too long to realize I was in charge and could change things, but the business has been better since he passed.  I've recommitted myself to growing as a graphic designer and the quality of our finished product is so much higher now that I'm not drifting through life in a haze of weed and anxiety.  We're in a spot where we're growing and making smart business decisions, but I still don't have the cash flow I need to replace our nearly 20 year old equipment or hire on a salesman.  It always feels like we take two steps forward and then the forklift breaks down... we make real good progress redesigning the website and then the electrical box that powers our compressor pops and we've got bills I can't cover.  We always find our way through, but I know that my retirement plan is waiting for my parents to pass away, which isn't fun at all.  Sorry for the trauma dump!  I don't have too many people in the real world I can talk to about it.",

Riding that excitement and trusting my network, I started doing my own job in interior design, graphic design etc. In the beginning, it was fine, but over time I got stuck in a repetitive cycle. I kept telling myself, “This time i will reach my goal, next month, next year I’ll succeed,” and 7 years have passed. Now a truth that I didn’t want to see, has surfaced.\n\nI hesitate to look for a “normal” job because I feel like people will say, “You’ve been away from your field for so long,” so I don’t even apply. I’ve done a lot independently, and I know that compared to an office employee, I can manage projects and handle all the tough processes much faster and better, because running your own business isn’t just technical work, it’s managing the whole process.\n\nBut I feel like independent work isn’t seen as “real work,” and it’s hard to provide proof of your achievements. Continuing my own business means always looking for new clients, earning money from whatever you find, working for free for days. I no longer have goals of making money in this field, nor the excitement to create amazing work.\n\nSeeing my network on LinkedIn with their fancy titles and constant promotions depresses me. We’re in the same industry, but in my own business, they're doing only a small part of my business and that makes them managers.\n\nSo I think this feeling is not about age, but about a reality check.

          "body": "I understand the feeling of being trapped. \n\nMid-60's here and it's been very difficult the last couple of years. We're a smaller specialist agency that has very large and mid-sized enterprises for clients. Almost all of the web development we used to do is done offshore (we decided not to become an offshore agency years ago). We pivoted to high-value services that aren't easily done offshore, which helps; but the volume for an engagement is more typically in the low tens of thousands of $ instead of the hundreds of thousands. We lost our whale client a year ago and it's been a deep hole.\n\nI've explored partnering/being acquired by other companies in my business, but it's a hard sell because our business is down. So I feel forced to make this business work. I've been through the downs and ups over the last 30+ years, so it's not unrealistic to make this happen--I've done it a couple times before--but I'm getting tired of having to retrench and start over. I feel my age in that respect. And like you, I doubt that I could find a job that pays what I need--and who's hiring someone my age? So I have to make this business work better once again.\n\nWhat I take away from my experience is that I should have sold years ago when we were on an upward path. I didn't because the good times were rolling and I had built my little one-person operation into a high 7-figure, profitable company that had 60+ employees and a million dollars in cash on hand. That would have been a great time to sell. Instead I invested in a product development that I really believed in but that didn't pan out, and kept the company going when things went down. \n\nIf I had made some different decisions, I would be retired now, comfortably. As it is, I can't retire any time in the foreseeable future. Ironically, I've had a number of employees who made it all the way to retirement working in my company--I'm somewhat proud of that, almost like launching my kids in a way. But I don't share in it at this point. \n\nI don't know what the answer is, and in my business a big win can change things considerably. But I can't count on that and my runway seems shorter, and I should have become more risk-adverse with respect to putting money away rather than investing in the business--which I saw as investing in myself. That was a mistake. Those are two separate tracks. I'm in the process of figuring it out and, unlike running my business, this all seems new and not comfortable. \n\nI don't know if any of this is helpful, except maybe to say you're not alone.",

All 3 of my original partners have moved on to other things, but as a director/editor I’ve always been the most in demand. I would not be able to make nearly as much money in-house somewhere. So I press on wearing lots of hats and with a stable of freelance collaborators.\n\nAI is a tool. It is going to be used to save time and money (already cutting out transcription/translation turnarounds and scanning through footage in seconds) but the need for content is going nowhere. Brands that take themselves seriously will continue to spend money on advertising content. Someone will need to be behind the curtain using all of the tools available to create.\n\nAnd brands want to work with someone they can trust to manage a project from start to finish with all the bumps along the way as well as execute. Hard to come by in my experience. I’ve also seen companies “save money” this year by working only “in-house” and then just white labeling with us. This has meant less competitive bidding, and has worked out well.\n\nBeing a creative who keeps the books, runs payroll, handles insurance, manages the office/equipment/crew with a smile is unique. It sounds like you being a lot to the table. Find the opportunities at each brand/agency/org where you can add value. I even did payroll-only for $500k in work for a friend that’s in-house at a big brand because their AP is such a mess that they were losing vendors.\n\nWhen things were dead at the beginning of the year due to tariff fears, I called all of my contacts and asked them what their needs were. Since June it’s become our second best year ever. Plenty of factors out of our control, but if you were full time you’d have to be worried about layoffs, so try to use your strengths and experience to fill clients needs whatever they may be. Easier said, but I’ve been on the rollercoaster for a long time now and I’m still optimistic about the future of our industry. Good luck!",

Same thing happened with a great piece of luggage from another company — both were items I’d never splurge on, but appreciate having.\n\nIf it’s an actual gift VS marketing knickknacks, your team will genuinely appreciate the thought. Focus on quality, skip the quantity.",

          "body": "I literally work in corporate gifting for a living. Typically larger companies, bigger budgets either by way of quantity or quality.  This is my two cents.. \n1. If you do a logo, make it small and subtle. A little icon or something less obvious is a good way to brand something without taking away usability. Using a mug as an example, a basic ceramic one with a loud logo will be the first i declutter. A nice quality one with a subtle logo would be more appreciated. \n2. If you’re not doing your own decoration, don’t pay extra to get it done. You care more about the logo than anyone receiving it. \n3. If it’s low budget, don’t buy junk… just get a giftcard. We can design beautiful gift boxes but $20 doesn’t go far without looking cheap. With a $20 amazon gift card, i can put it towards that thing I wanted, A pair of socks looks cheap. If you really want to do swag, then give something small, knowing it may be trashed, but give something else with it, like a giftcard. \n4. Echoing 3, but don’t buy the cheap version of something. A $10 cooler is still a $10 cooler… probably not very good. \n5. Real examples of interesting swag I’ve seen (not just more expensive everything): leather goods like nice coasters, key fobs, and Dopp kits. Tech organizers. Hand thrown mug with small stamped logo. Custom keyboards. Olive wood cooking utensils. Hot pads/ oven mitts. Glass togo container. Wireless charger. Mixed reactions on journals.. small accessory to go with a themed gift- ex- coffee scoop with nice coffee, chopsticks with a ramen gift, popcorn bowl with movie theme, candle snuffer with spa theme. \n\nSmall tip for anyone ordering swag. ALWAYS order more than you need, especially when on a clock. Almost every company will send a few with misprints. Obviously returns depend on the vendor, but there’s always an error",

      "selftext": "Rant-&gt; My husband has an LLC business which he does full time. He does a lot of contracting and recently got into flipping houses to rent/airbnb. For the past 6 years I have done all of his bookkeeping while he does all the hands on work. Every quarter, it’s always a battle to get all the receipts from him and organized and I absolutely dread it. I work part time already in my own job, but I pick up a lot of shifts too. His business has continued to grow and taxes are getting more and more complicated adding on the house flipping and rental income. I used to have just 1 excelsheet for his LLC and now I have like 4 for all of his different business ventures. It’s December again and I already know this will consume and ruin my month. He is just not good at bookkeeping and I know if he tried to do it himself he would miss major things. I feel resentful to him because I feel like this is falling on my shoulders and I’m done with it. When I try to tell him this, he says it is “our business” and I benefit from the money made in the business. I think it might be time to hire a bookkeeper for my sanity and for the sake of our marriage…. Thoughts anyone? Rant over lol. \n\nEdit: I also manage our Airbnb and do all the cleanings/turnovers myself. I don’t mind doing this, but it is just one more thing on my plate. ",

She kept saying how I referred to the business as “my business” and not “our” business even though she wasn’t involved. I wanted her to be and we figured out she could do the books and handle some calls.  It was a small contracting service business so maybe 5-10 hours a week.  I thought it was perfect and it kept her in the loop and a part of things.   Long story short, things weren’t getting done, slow to get done or not the way I wanted.   Now I had to walk the fine line of not talking to her like an employee.  As we grew, we ran into exactly what you described.   I slowly started doing more of the office work and she noticed. Then I questioned something one day and she said “‘maybe you should just take over everything again.”  I happily agreed.   It may have saved our marriage lol. It’s a hard line to balance on.  I wish she spoke up sooner.  I wish I spoke up sooner.   Neither of us wanted to.   I highly recommend at least approaching him to talk, he may be thinking the same exact thing.  Good luck!",

But from what I can tell, starting a business usually requires hell of a lot more effort: longer hours, more stress, upfront capital, higher risk, and a lot of uncertainty.\n\nIn many cases it feels tougher than a traditional job, especially early on. So why do some people frame it as easy or straightforward? I’m not anti-business at all, but I’m struggling to understand why it’s framed as “easy” or “anyone can do it\". Please enlighten me.  \n",

          "body": "I think a lot of the “starting a business is easy” framing comes from people collapsing very different things into one idea.\n\nStarting a business can be simple in the sense that there’s no gatekeeper. You don’t need permission, a boss, or a formal application to try. That lack of friction gets misinterpreted as lack of difficulty.\n\nWhat’s often left out is that simplicity at the start usually trades places with complexity later. The hours, risk, uncertainty, and emotional load don’t disappear, they’re just not front-loaded the way a 9–5 is.\n\nThere’s also survivorship bias and platform incentives at play. People who made it through tend to talk about the freedom and autonomy, while the stress, failed attempts, and long unprofitable stretches don’t perform well on social media.\n\nSo I don’t think most people mean “easy” as in low effort. They mean:\n\nno formal barrier to entry\n\nautonomy instead of structure\n\nupside without a salary cap\n\n\nWhether that’s preferable to a 9–5 really depends on someone’s risk tolerance, financial buffer, and what kind of stress they handle better. For many people, a traditional job is actually the harder-earned stability.\n\nYour instinct is right. Early-stage business ownership is usually harder than a 9–5, just in different ways.

But neither could run a business, they admit that. Then I have a sister Linda that works 30 hours a week and is broke all the time. Linda also complains about her job and how broke she is. I've always told Linda if she ever wants to start a business I am here for anything she needs including that first $100.... 35 years later she is still broke and complaining. But to be fair, I'll call this one even as well even though business should get the point.\n\nI made enough money in my service business to retire after 20 years at age 50. Not many 'regular' jobs will do that.\n\nBUT... owning a business is not for everyone. Lots of people are meant to work for someone else and complain about it every day, really. Then when those people get laid off/ fired, they worry and spend countless hours looking for a job and making no money until they finally find another job. But that is how we all grew up and were taught, it's not our fault we were all taught that. \n\nIf I was broke and my business closed today... I could start another service business tomorrow and be making money by the end of the week. Mowing, cleaning houses, washing windows, handyman, junk removal.... what ever it takes if I was broke. \n\nOne trick is to make enough money in your business to be able to pay others to do what you don't want/ like to do. I hate paperwork... so I have someone else do it. I always have.",

          "body": "Because “easy” gets conflated with *simple*, and those are very different things.\n\nStarting a business is often conceptually simple: find a customer, solve a problem, charge money. That part *is* more straightforward than navigating corporate ladders, politics, performance reviews, and permission structures. But execution-wise, it’s usually harder than a 9–5 in almost every dimension you listed: hours, stress, risk, and ambiguity.\n\nThe people framing it as “easy” usually fall into one of three buckets:\n\n* **They’re selling something** (courses, coaching, vibes).\n* **They already crossed the hardest phase** and forgot what it felt like.\n* **They’re confusing autonomy with ease.** Owning your time feels lighter, even if you’re working more.\n\nWhat doesn’t get talked about enough is that early-stage business difficulty isn’t the *work* itself, it’s the cognitive load. You’re the CEO, ops manager, bookkeeper, sales, compliance, and customer support simultaneously. A 9–5 externalizes most of that complexity.\n\nIronically, this is also why so many small businesses struggle long-term. Not because the idea is bad, but because operations never get systematized, so the founder stays stuck carrying everything in their head.\n\nThat’s actually the problem we’re trying to address with Quorum (still in beta). Not making business “easy,” but making the operational side less chaotic once things start working—so founders can build systems instead of just enduring stress. It’s not for everyone, and it doesn’t remove risk, but it helps reduce the constant context-switching that burns people out.\n\nThe honest framing should be: starting a business isn’t easier than a 9–5. It’s just a different kind of hard, and some people prefer *that* kind of hard. For those who do, having real operational structure matters a lot more than the motivational slogans people post online.\n\nIf relevant: [https://usequorum.app](https://usequorum.app)",

          "body": "You should be doing everything you can reasonably justify as a business expense as a business write off, this is what everyone else does. It's one of the big advantages of owning your own business and if you're not doing it that's a ton of money on the table. Save the receipt, write on it what it was for, save it in your bookkeeping software to reference if you ever get audited. This applies to literally any reasonable expense that could be justified as marketing costs that would not have happened if you didn't own a business. Reasonable means reasonable - client gifts absolutely count, but not if the gift is like... a jet ski or if your client is actually your aunt. Buying things they ask you to buy is even more clear cut - I would even say you're in the right to charge your client for milage and hours doing this. I wouldn't charge clients but definitely should be writing off that milage involved at the IRS milage tax rate.\n\n\nFyi - you don't need to charge to a biz card to do this. All that matters is the receipt. A business card isn't anything special - it a normal credit card in every sense of the word except one that is marketed towards businesses. You can write off stuff on your personal card and you can charge personal items to a business card, the IRS or the banks don't care at all. It just makes your life easier knowing that your business card truly only has business transactions on it, which is especially important if you have employees.",

I would do the later as it's much easier and will come off the earnings directly on your P&amp;L as gross profit. The bits about the LLC as mentioned below really don't play into your situation as you don't have anything to really be protected from, you driving to and from and your management decisions will not be absolved by the LLC if something occurs. Good insurance on the other hand is vital! Just make sure you add line items to your invoices of Items Purchased for Client (or something to that accord) and tag it out as a separate line item so your end of year taxes will be cleaner because you can tie the COGS to that specific Revenue, quick and clean. Document everything because you can add mileage and other expenses due to the nature of delivery and get a pretty nice chunk deducted for that as well, presuming you own the vehicle and not the company.",

Any card/setup that makes receipts + notes easy helps thats why people use tools like Ramp but the accounting treatment matters more than the card itself",
