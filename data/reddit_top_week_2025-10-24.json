      "selftext": "For years I tried everything... Im talking so many different things.. dropshipping, website design, URL website arbitrage,  affiliate programs, freelancing, print-on-demand....you name it. Every time I thought I‚Äôd found ‚Äúthe one,‚Äù I would lose steam out after a few weeks. Sometimes it was because it wasnt for me, other times it was because life got in the way.\n\nNow I‚Äôm 40, and about a year ago (my wife told me about it 4 years ago ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)  I stumbled into something that finally¬†*worked*: UGC, which stands for user-generated content.\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt heard of it, it‚Äôs when regular people (not influencers.. Im just a random normal dude) create videos that brands use for their paid ads or organic social media. No following required, no crazy tech setup, just the ability to film, talk naturally, and understand/follow requests from a brand.\n\nFor me, this clicked because it rewards experience, not youth. The industry is full of younger creators, but many brands actually want creators who look like their real customers. Parents, homeowners, professionals, real people with life experience.\n\nIt took me 5 years of failed side hustles to find something that let me use my personality, storytelling, and creativity and actually get paid for it. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúeasy,‚Äù but it‚Äôs accessible, and it‚Äôs been life changing.\n\nIf you‚Äôre 35+ and still trying to find something that sticks, UGC is worth looking into.. it changed my life and as I was sitting here eating lunch I figured I would share because maybe it could change someone else's too.",

      "selftext": "A few days, I shared a post titled\\*‚ÄúIt took me 5 years to finally make money online and now I‚Äôm finally full time and thriving.‚Äù\\*\n\nSince then, I‚Äôve had hundreds of people reach out asking¬†how to get started in UGC, so I figured I‚Äôd make a road map post breaking it all down.\n\nLet‚Äôs be clear:¬†it‚Äôs not easy.  \nBut it¬†*is*¬†accessible and that‚Äôs the beauty of it.  \nIt‚Äôs just a matter of putting the pieces together and staying consistent.\n\nThat said,¬†UGC isn‚Äôt for everyone.  \nIf you hate being on camera, don‚Äôt like sending emails, negotiating, or doing admin work then this probably isn‚Äôt for you.\n\nAlso, anyone who says¬†*you have to buy a course*¬†to learn ANYTHING is a liar.  \nYou can 100% learn UGC or anything else in this world on your own using posts like this, YouTube, and trial and error.\n\nThat said,¬†courses and mentorships can shorten your learning curve, you‚Äôll learn faster, make fewer mistakes, and have people to lean on when you hit roadblocks.  \nIt‚Äôs optional, but it¬†does¬†speed things up.\n\n# Quick FAQ\n\n* **What is UGC?**¬†‚ÄúUser Generated Content.‚Äù It‚Äôs content (usually short-form video) made by regular people for brands to use in paid ads or organic social posts.\n   * **Do I need followers?**¬†No. Brands care about the quality and relatability of your videos, not your audience size. If they do care about your audience size then its influencer marketing not UGC\n   * **Do I need to show my face?**¬†Not always. Voiceovers, product demos, and unboxing videos are all fair game but in my opinion if you never plan on showing your face I probably wouldn't recommend UGC\n* **What equipment do I need?**¬†Your phone and a tripod. A lav mic and LED light (each around $20) are great bonuses.\n* **Do I need experience?**¬†No. You‚Äôll learn as you go. Brands care more about energy, clarity, and authenticity.\n* **What age can do it?**¬†All ages and the industry really needs more people**35+**¬†right now.\n* **Do I need to be good-looking?**¬†Nope. The more¬†normal and relatable¬†you are, the better.\n* **Will my friends/family see my videos?**¬†Probably one day. So only create content for products you‚Äôd be comfortable being seen promoting.\n\n# Step-by-Step: How to Get Started\n\n# 1. Understand What UGC Is\n\nSearch¬†**#UGCexample**¬†on X (Twitter) to see real examples.  \nUGC videos are typically ads for Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube where a creator promotes a product in a real, authentic way.\n\n# 2. Build a Simple Portfolio\n\nUse¬†**Canva**¬†(free version).  \nYou don‚Äôt need Canva Pro.  \nCreate a clean, single-page site with your example videos and an¬†*About Me*¬†section.  \nBuy a $20 URL inside Canva so it looks professional.\n\n# 3. Create 4 Example Videos\n\nUse products you already own.  \nFocus on¬†**good lighting**¬†and¬†**clear sound.**  \nPick four different niches to show variety e.g.:\n\n* 1 beauty or skincare\n* 1 pet-related\n* 1 fitness or wellness\n* 1 app or SaaS product\n\nMake each video a¬†*different style:*\n\n* Talking head with b-roll\n* Voiceover + only b-roll\n* Green screen\n* Testimonial/review\n\n# 4. Film an ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù Video\n\nThis goes on your portfolio alongside your written intro and you can also use it on profiles inside UGC specific platform.  \nUse natural light, keep it conversational, and overlay b-roll that represents you.\n\nDon‚Äôt just say ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Roseanne and I create authentic content.‚Äù  \nInstead, make it personal and specific: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Roseanne, a 38-year-old stay-at-home mom from Utah. I love gardening, fitness, and art. After years in the corporate world, I‚Äôm tech-savvy and love testing new apps and tools. My lean on my past experience in XYZ to work with brands, understand their vision and the scope of their needs, and then deliver content that is valuable and meaningful.\n\nBullet points are easier to read and focus on what makes¬†*you*¬†unique: glasses, grey hair, pets, travel, hobbies, etc.\n\n# 5. Start Applying for Gigs\n\nOnce your portfolio and 4 examples are ready, start applying daily.  \nCheck:\n\n* subreddit : ugccreators has a lot of  job listings \n* X (hashtags: #UGCCreatorsNeeded, #UGCOpportunities)\n* UGC platforms:¬†**Billo, JoinBrands, Vidsy, Cohley, Vidovo, Insense, Popfly, Backstage, Upwork**\n\nTreat it like a¬†**numbers game.**  \nIf you apply every day for an hour, you‚Äôll start landing gigs.  \nIf you apply to 2x more, you‚Äôll land 2x more. ( if you apply 1 hour a day and land 1 gig a week, then apply 2 hours a day and youll land 2 gigs a week)  \nOver time, you can add social proof to your portfolio, your examples get better, and reviews snowball into consistent paid work.\n\nI hope this helps and feel free to ask me anything below.  \nI try to respond to every message, even if it takes a bit.",

If you want something more flexible, you can do online tasks  like freelancing basic stuff on Fiverr or Upwork (data entry, writing short descriptions, etc.) or even managing social media pages for small local businesses. The key isn‚Äôt to find the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù skill right away but to start doing something that teaches you responsibility, communication, and consistency.

Do they all drive really expensive cars? Do they have fancy gardens and lawns? Do they all like to play tennis? etc.\n\nNow go home and look up the things you see those rich people doing. And see what jobs there are that help maintain those rich people things. Some of those jobs have a low barrier to entry. Like waxing fiberglass, it takes a $50 tool, some buffing compound, and strong arms that don't get tired easily. But people with money will pay to have their boat waxed every year because then it's shiny.  Or maybe they want to have their cars professionally detailed in their own driveway? Or maybe they want their leather golf club bag given some leather care and cleaning? Or maybe they'd like to have someone come to their house and use a sonic cleaner for their jewelry? Or have all their stupid-expensive knives sharpened up to 3000 grit? Or wash their walkway, driveway, patio, &amp; brick with a pressure washer?  Or have the numbers for their house repainted?\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nFind what people who have money don't want to do themselves, and offer to do that thing. If you don't have a skill, offer to do a thing that doesn't require a lot of skill, but does require a lot of time and maybe gets dirty. Things rich people don't like dealing with.\n\nStart your own business. As you get better at it, you can raise your price. As you get even better at it, the fact that you take less time means you can do more jobs without lowering your price making you more money. Maybe you can even hire a helper or two.\n\nThis is how my ex's brother went from student to independently wealthy in about 5 years. He just took most of the money he made (in his case lawn care) and spent it on expanding his little business. In the end he had multiple trucks, a whole bunch of lawnmowers, about 15 employees, and he sold the business to his best employee and used it to buy a McMansion for cash.",

You could also print out paper fliers and post them around neighborhood shops (with permission). Make sure a trusted adult knows the addresses you‚Äôre visiting to work. \n\nYou could also try offering babysitting, simple tutoring, or pet sitting services in the same way, but these services may be harder to sell with 0 experience. People will want to know why they should trust you with their kids (a you CPR certified? trustworthy? good with kids? etc) or knowledgable about pets, or that you are tutoring a subject you are good at (did you get straight As in AP Language Arts?) etc. Maybe you have a skill you had not considered before tho? \n\nThe other old fashioned way to get a job. I‚Äôd suggest restaurants if you can swing it, they usually pay unskilled youth the best, because you‚Äôll generally get a share of tip money in addition to minimum wage. Sometimes you can take cash home the same day you work. Any job will do, though! See if you can help out in a field you are interested in possible working in someday. \n\nThe new-fashioned way is online. Sell crafts on Ebay or Etsy, make videos for Tiktok &amp; YT. Write an ebook. There are lots of posts about this, look them up.",

With that being said, I want to make some money before I move out, so I was thinking about making money online, but I don't know from where to start and if any of this is actually safe.\n\nI have a very little free time because of studying so I don't have a lot of time to spend on trying to make money. Just a small side hustle I can to on the weekends to make at least a very little money. I was thinking about completing surveys or online task, but I can't figure out which are legit.\n\nAny ideas? even if it will give a very little profit it would be a lot of helpful. (I will in Europe if that will help)",

      "selftext": "Okay, after nine actual side hustles, I'm pretty sure my biggest accomplishment is proving I can come up with way more terrible ideas than good ones. Seriously.\n\nI‚Äôve tried everything‚Ä¶. Etsy shops, blogs, print-on-demand, random AI projects, Pinterest loops, even indexing experiments that made my laptop sound like it was about to take off. Most of them died quietly. A few survived. And the stuff that stuck honestly had less to do with talent and more to do with timing.\n\nFirst lesson learned: quit the guessing game. My 'cool' ideas always crashed and burned. But when I simply started paying attention to the data, like trending keywords, those sudden search spikes, and what people were actually buying, things finally picked up. It's unsexy, sure, but it gets the job done.\n\nNext up, I realized loops are king. Forget doing one-off projects; it‚Äôs all about creating these little engines. Like Pinterest traffic sending folks to a blog, or old Medium articles funneling people to Etsy, or even just old listings getting evergreen sales thanks to reviews. The best ones were the ones that just kept going without me having to obsess over them.\n\nLesson three, ditch the 'originality' obsession. I seriously thought I needed to conjure up something nobody had ever seen. Nope. Turns out, just taking a winning concept, giving it your own spin, and getting it out there quickly is a far more profitable game.\n\nThe rest? It‚Äôs mostly noise. Fancy tools, new ‚Äúgrowth hacks,‚Äù even ads, they helped sometimes, but not for long. What actually worked was keeping things small, repeating what clicked, and not getting bored when it got repetitive.\n\nOn paper, none of this sounds particularly impressive. But it's effective, and it just works, silently. And after diving into nine different hustles, I can tell you, 'quietly working' is now infinitely more appealing than the fleeting promise of 'maybe going viral.\n\nAnyone else find that the simple, boring stuff ends up working best?",

No bargaining, track a paper streak, keep it realistic.\n    \n    \n    Examples I actually did (reputable platforms only):\n    - eBay: photograph and draft one listing (even if I publish later)\n    - Upwork: improve my profile headline or tailor one proposal (no mass‚Äëapply)\n    - Etsy: rewrite one listing description for clarity and keywords (no gimmicks)\n    - Uber Eats: check my schedule and set a 90‚Äëminute block for later in the week\n    \n    \n    Why this helped me:\n    - It converts ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it tonight‚Äù into a concrete morning win\n    - 5‚Äì10 minutes is small enough to avoid excuses but big enough to create momentum\n    - The streak keeps me honest without over‚Äëoptimizing\n    \n    \n    Questions for this sub:\n    - What‚Äôs a compliant, 5‚Äì10 minute ‚Äúfirst action‚Äù you‚Äôve used on a reputable platform that clearly helps (not spam or mass outreach)?\n    - How do you prevent this from ballooning into a 45‚Äëminute session that burns you out before work?\n    - On days you‚Äôre wiped, what minimum keeps the streak alive without pretending it‚Äôs progress?\n    \n    \n    Not asking for work or offering any ‚Äî just looking for realistic, rule‚Äëcompliant ideas that have genuinely helped you move the needle.",

See YouTube on how to do that. \n\nI setup, 15 min, shoot 15 min, Lightroom maybe 30 min. I buy USB thumb drives in bulk from Aliexpress. Put exported Jpgs on it (3 different resolutions, low for Facebook, mid for computer background, 8x10 600dpi), parent can go anywhere for prints. \n\nGather stuff 15 min. I stay longer to ensure customer is happy and won‚Äôt charge more, to a limit. Depends on next customer that day. \n\n100$ - 200$ for such a service would be standard. Plus if kid is ready, all is done in 5 minutes. The other ten minutes (or more), get each parent also, whole family, etc. Bother and sister is very popular. Custom backgrounds are also very popular. \n\nI often just take random pics on vacation (beach), in parks and near landmarks with perfect noon-day sunny day just for this. I‚Äôm thinking of printing 8x10 or A4 format, 6 or 8 backgrounds, put in a catalog, have the parent select while taking pictures. \n\nSchool pics are easily 100$-300$ as you pay per printed kit.

Your own shopping service or Insta-cart (No one blinks when you take your child to the supermarket)\n\nIf you do decide to do any of these you should also price in an Umbrella Insurance policy in case you are in an accident or get sued for some reason. Perhaps business insurance too for the house cleaning. \n\nBest of luck",

My brother taught me a bit of python, I felt smart, I thought rent would sort itself out. It didn‚Äôt, it didn‚Äôt at all. I spun up WordPress, let chatgpt and Gemini grind around 500 posts, added meta tags and whatnot, watched the analytics like a hawk, refreshed again, refreshed again also. Ad revenue after half a year was $28.35, which might buy me a lunch.\n\nI tried AI faceless videos too. Stock voices, avatars, tool recs. One clip hit 48 views, most did 30 or less, and I was down \\~280 for subs. A comment said it felt like an ad made by an AI for another AI, which is kinda fair and also also painful.\n\nI even pushed AI stock photos. Hundreds uploaded, ten downloads, $6.3 usd. The only thing that actually gave me money back was price drop monkey, clawed about $148.5 in gift cards from pirce drops. Not income, but defintely real cash back, unlike teh promise of passive anything.\n\nIf someone here cracked it without ads or an audience, I‚Äôm listening.",

      "selftext": "I‚Äôve been on Etsy for 2 years. When I launched my very first shop, I got just¬†**1 sale in the first month**. After years of testing and learning the platform, my¬†**6th shop**¬†did¬†**180 sales in its first month**. With the right strategy, sales grow month after month after launch.\n\nHere‚Äôs what it really takes to reach¬†**3k a month:**\n\n1. **Daily posting.**¬†Add new listings every day. Refresh old ones (photos/tags/descriptions) from time to time. The algorithm loves activity.\n2. **Product selection = competitor analysis.**¬†I use eRank to study competitors‚Äô bestsellers and only post products that already have proven demand -then I¬†**remix**¬†them into my own version (design, bundle, offer).\n3. **Discounts are strategy, not decoration.**¬†But also, I‚Äôve seen a shop with 40k sales that didn‚Äôt run ‚Äú% off‚Äù but used a¬†**bundle offer**¬†like ‚ÄúTake 2 posters and get 50% off the pair.‚Äù It is also good strategy haha.\n4. **Don‚Äôt ‚Äúsleep‚Äù after launch.**¬†Many people open a shop and then post nothing for weeks. Etsy gives you a¬†**Start boost -**¬†if you miss that window, it‚Äôs harder later.\n5. **Bad start? Reset fast.**¬†If your shop is cold for 1-3 months with no clear reason,¬†**close it and reopen**¬†with a sharper niche, storefront, and strategy. It‚Äôs faster than trying to revive a dead listing set. (I had this situation before)\n6. **Consistency or nothing.**¬†My friend hit 1k in first month with 3 bestseller listings. When those cooled off, she stopped uploading. She doing one listing a week, and it isn‚Äôt enough.¬†**Daily momentum = steady growth.**\n\n**A note on timing**\n\nThis month many sellers (me included) noticed odd shifts - sales dipped like Etsy tweaked something so much. If you‚Äôre about to start, consider waiting a couple of weeks for stability. Use that time to prep listings, bundle offers, and your daily posting plan.\n\nI have my own paid cheap on this topic, but I'm not linking it here to follow sub rules.\n\nLet me know what you think about :)",

None of these worked for me because I was very introverted and didn‚Äôt have the knowledge to persuade people to buy what I was selling. By arbitration I thought it was drop shipping and that just seemed like a bad idea unless you have permission to sell people stuff. Affiliate Marketing seemed like you are just trying to make people join something that you don‚Äôt fully understand and once I understood what a pyramid scheme was that‚Äôs what I saw in every business plan. \nBasically by pyramid, there is someone on top and the lower ‚Äúlegs‚Äù or level, or hierarchy or whatever you want to call it. Different levels of management is called a pyramid so I still think it‚Äôs in everything like the government, corporations, businesses, etc. \n\nSo I found something that works for me!\n\nIf you feel like you need to get away from all of the business stuff, the pyramid scheme, the classes that cost too damn much and all the gurus that can‚Äôt help\n\nLISTEN UP!\n\nSo when I found this thing called making money from your phone ten years ago, I was curious!\n\nHow do you make money from your phones?\nIt was of course part of a bribe or a marketing scheme that will get you into an affiliate marketing campaign called Imarketslive. \n\nI‚Äôm not promoting their products or the business but I am promoting what they taught me. \n\nSo, as detailed as possible, currency was created after the barter system. When people saw the value of trading people‚Äôs resources they were then ‚Äúenslaved‚Äù by materialistic things like gold, silver, bronze, wood, hay, bricks, rare metals and stones, upon other things.\n\nSo people found a standard system on which to trade which is the gold standard. Gold is traded to determine how much currency you have to purchase building materials, machinery, equipment, livestock, food, etc!\n\nGold along with money is transferred from the trading markets to the banks, held in vaults and only exchanged for big profits. \n\nA standard 24 karat gold bar is worth between $4,000 - $5,000 USD\n\nA 400 ounce gold bar is $1.3 million dollars or more!\n\nSo, instead of carrying around all of the gold from country to country, we made something that weighs less, can be easily replace, and is easier to transport.\n\nWhen technology advanced, we now can trade with the banks buying into money and trading with the banks as ‚Äúretail traders‚Äù \n\nA retail trader is anyone that has the means to trade online but doesn‚Äôt have a corporate bank behind them to trade money. \n\nSo, now that you‚Äôve reached the end I don‚Äôt want to borrow more time from you that I already have or you will have to message me to learn the system or process that I use to trade thousands of dollars on my phone or my computer without any work other than looking at fluctuating prices and lines that should be common sense.",

Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

I consider passive savings to be the same as passive income ( or better since it‚Äôs not subject to income taxes). I earn about $3000 per year in cash back on credit card spend by using the ‚Äúright‚Äù card for most of my purchases.\n\nI started a lending business that required some up front work in underwriting clients, and about 30 minutes of ongoing work each week (so technically not totally passive) that made about $30k the first year, and was up to $100k by the 4th year. It‚Äôs year 7 now and the income is back down to around $65k a year.\n\nI used to post articles on eHow that would generate $30-$40 per month collectively.\n\nI‚Äôve subscribed to a site that lists class action lawsuit settlements, and when I see one I qualify for I join the settlement. Classaction.org\n\nI‚Äôve checked my name on the abandoned property websites maintained by the states I‚Äôve lived in and found some lost monies I was owed.\n\nI‚Äôve done medical research studies (in college) that paid a few thousand. Not totally passive, but not exactly work either.\n\nOnce upon a time there was a service called Earny‚Ä¶you‚Äôd sign up and give access to your email account and it would track online purchases made at retailers that offered a price match if the price you paid for something dropped within X days of your purchase. Sometimes that price protection was offered by a store, but it was also a feature of some of the premium credit cards. After signing up, I‚Äôd literally just get checks on the mail to deposit. I don‚Äôt believe that service still exists.\n\nI knew someone who worked at a coin collector who would pay a premium for certain collectible sets that would go on sale at a mint. As an example a set might cost $3200 from the mint (available in limited quantities), his company would offer $100-$200 above that, and I‚Äôd buy it in my credit card (getting $30 worth of cashback in addition to the cost plus premium paid back to me by his company). A bunch of us would do that‚Ä¶apparently the coin collector was looking for pieces that were ‚Äúperfect‚Äù quality in those sets that would fetch a far higher premium and he was still able to unload the new sets we ordered for a profit no matter what. That was like 20 years ago.\n\nI‚Äôm sure there have been other things over the years. I haven‚Äôt done any video content creation, digital agency work, or guides/eBooks. Never tried dropshipping either.",

It‚Äôs easy to spread yourself too thin trying every method (digital products, affiliate links, stocks, etc.)  and end up with nothing sustainable. The key is to focus on one or two income streams, master them, and automate as much as possible before adding anything else.\n\nI started in print on demand 4 years ago and have been succesful in this. I consistently make 10-20 sales per week with POD. I started digital marketing in April of this year, and after a lot of tweaks, I have been seeing sales in this area also. A lot of people are quick to say, \"making money online is a scam.\" People saying this only say this because they haven't cracked the code to success. Making money online is not a scam. It is possible. I am proof of that.",

          "body": "This is actually the right mindset to have. Passive income isn‚Äôt about getting rich overnight, it‚Äôs about building something once and letting it keep working for you over time. One of the most approachable places to start is digital products. You can create planners, templates, or ebooks using beginner-friendly tools and list them on platforms like Gumroad or Etsy. Once they‚Äôre uploaded, they can generate income without requiring constant active work.\n\nPrint-on-demand is another great option if you want something scalable without having to handle inventory. You design products like T-shirts, hoodies, or mugs, and the platform takes care of the printing and shipping. It‚Äôs simple to start and can run in the background once your store is up.\n\nAffiliate marketing is a strong choice if you‚Äôre interested in recommending products. You share links, and when someone makes a purchase through your link, you earn a commission. When paired with content like a blog, newsletter, or social media, this can turn into a reliable income stream.\n\nStarting a YouTube channel is one of the most powerful ways to build something long-term. You don‚Äôt have to be on camera if you‚Äôre not comfortable with it, and there are tools that make voiceovers and editing simple. Once your channel gains traction, it can bring in income through ads, affiliate links, sponsorships, and even your own products.\n\nYou could also explore freelancing or offering digital services as a way to build initial capital while working on more passive streams. And for a long-term foundation, investing in things like index funds or dividend-paying stocks can be a smart move to grow your income steadily.\n\nThe key is to pick one lane to start, build momentum, and layer in other streams over time. That‚Äôs how people create real freedom without needing to hustle endlessly.\n\nI cover all the strategies to build an online income business in my newsletter. Visit my newsletter, link in my bio.",

My goal is to be 100% transparent about the work, the costs, and the mistakes.\n\n**The Niche:** I chose niche \"vintage camera repair\"\\] because I had a personal interest in it, but I also saw low-competition keywords.\n\n**The Strategy (The \"Passive\" Part):** The income is \"passive\" now, but it took a year of very active, upfront work.\n\n1. **Content:** Wrote 50 high-quality, SEO-optimized articles (avg. 1,500 words).\n2. **Monetization:** Started with display ads (Ezoic/Mediavine) once I hit traffic thresholds.\n3. **Affiliate Links:** Added affiliate links for \\[Products related to the niche, e.g., \"camera parts, specific tools\"\\].\n\n**The Numbers (Approx.):**\n\n* **Month 1-6:** $0 - $20/mo (The \"Google Sandbox\" is real)\n* **Month 7-9:** $100/mo (Traffic started picking up)\n* **Month 10-12:** $300 - $500/mo (Hit ad threshold, articles ranking)\n\n**Total Upfront Cost:**\n\n* Domain: $10\n* Hosting: $120 (for the year)\n* SEO Tool (optional): $99/mo (I used it for 3 months)\n* **Total:** \\~$430\n\n**My Biggest Mistake:** Wasting the first 3 months writing about topics *I* thought were interesting instead of what people were *actually* searching for. Keyword research is everything.\n\n**What's Next:** I now spend about 2-3 hours a month just updating plugins and maybe adding one new article. It's not \"set it and forget it,\" but it's highly leveraged.\n\nI hope this breakdown is helpful for anyone starting out.\n\n**What's the biggest \"mistake\" you made early in your passive income journey that you wish you could go back and fix?**",

Do you have any hobby interests that translate, maybe think outside the box?\n\nThese are all skills I developed at seperate points in my life, but really dedicated the initial time to learn, leaving me huge variety now, flexibility, and fun!  $$ amounts are Canadian\n\n- I teach guitar/piano ($80/hour, currently 30 hours a week from home, because I am really enjoying it, but sometimes I slim it to 15-20 hours if my other interests are higher. $60,000-$100,000/yr\n\n- I teach people how to fly model planes and racing drones($50/hour ish), and teach groups of kids how to build and launch rockets. Very casual, i do this in the dry months, probably just a couple times a week. Most parents are lazy, and won‚Äôt help their kids/youth with these specific hobbies, or think they are going to be expensive (they are not ).  So plenty of room for private instruction. \n\n- Book Keeping for small businesses. Not much skill required. It is not mathy and accounting. It is book keeping.  Don‚Äôt need any license or schooling. Just take some free courses online and find a mentor. Flat rate per month.  Probably $60k/year for 10 hours a week of whenever-I-want work at the coffee shop. \n\n- I enjoy working with wood. I have a full garage of wood working tools and machines, all paid for exclusively by making wooden towel ladders, and wood wall hexagons to sell to moms/wives on Facebook.   Towel ladders cost about $10 to make, and about 40 minutes to make 4 or 5 of them. I sell for $40-60 depending on details\n\n- I love flipping and trying music gear on marketplace. I rarely buy anything and then sell it for less.  I recycle the money into more gear. Guitars, PA Systems, FX pedals, etc.\n\n- I make video courses and sell on Udemy.  I have a course on how to solve the basic Rubik‚Äôs cube for a complete beginner.  It took me 4 hours to completely create and upload the course including design and film and edit.    It has made $500 total so far in about 6 months. But that‚Äôs a good hourly rate for the work.  I have other similar courses that do better, but that‚Äôs a good example of just thinking outside the box. \n\nOverall, private instruction is just a great living if you are confident in your skill. There are millions of people who only learn well with face to face human contact, and not online videos.    Teach/Instruct anything. \n\nI do have a degree in music, but it‚Äôs in a box in the basement since I got it and no one has ever asked to see it.  I‚Äôve made more money from hobby endeavours, than when I taught in school/college level. \n\nIt‚Äôs the literal ‚Äòfollow your dreams‚Äô approach. \n\nGood luck, message me anytime.",

          "body": "It's super simple.\n\nYou have to have something of value to trade for the money. Money is a placeholder for, and a way to measure, the relative value of something.\n\nYour goal for employment is to find the highest and best use of your time. For example...you might be qualified for the following jobs:\n\n$10/hour Fast Food Cashier\n\n$15/hour CostCo employee\n\n$25/hour Bank of America Teller\n\n$50/hour Plumber/Electrician\n\nIn each of those scenarios, you're giving up an hour of your time, but the value that you get is very different across those roles.\n\nIf you're only qualified for the first 2 jobs, then your goal is to figure out what training/education you need to upgrade your options.\n\nA bigger problem right now is that for quite a while now there4 have been more people graduating college than are needed for jobs that require a college degree. Since there are so many more people with college degrees out there than there are jobs that need college degrees, it means that people without college degrees are competing against people with college degrees for jobs that don't require college degrees. And since those people with college degrees largely have student loans and HAVE to work or else they will default on those loans, employers can get away with hiring college grads for cheap in jobs where someone doesn't really need a degree...and that relegates people who just have HS degrees and no other training to basic service jobs. And if you don't have a HS diploma/GED, fahgeddaboudit.\n\nSo if you find yourself struggling to make money, you need to do a real inventory of your skills, spend some time researching what various jobs pay (including any benefits, which have real value by the way) and see where there's overlap\n\nIncome generally doesn't just happen...you are far more likely to get the income you want if you make a plan for how to get there and then take steps down that path. It may take a while, but it'll probably happen because most other people don't make that plan.\n\nGood luck to you!\n\nedit:\n\nFor me, I grew up poor, but did very well in school. Prior to meeting my wife, I almost always have 2-4 roommates and was able to live cheaply and/or save because splitting bills 3+ ways generally is a good strategy for keeping living expenses low.\n\nI eventually got a master's degree from a well-regarded school, and started a business. I struggled to make money in that business for a decade. After 10 years, I decided to change directions and switch industries. During that time, I'd met and gotten to know a lot of people. One of them had several businesses and recognized that I was talented and referred me to a company that he knew was hiring. I started at a salary that was less than I was worth ($72k), and earned meaningful raises. I distinguished myself (provided a lot more value than he was paying for) while there and learned a new industry. I worked there for 10 years until I was making about $275k per year. At that point, I was still underpaid and for that and other reasons I quit. I now work for myself making comparable money in the same industry, and have a flexible schedule that allows me to spend more time with my family.",

My passive income project had its \"best day ever\" with a $400 sale, which turned out to be a fraud attack.\n\nI almost got hit with hundreds in chargeback fees ($15 per transaction!) on top of the lost sale.\n\nThe scary part? This happened because Stripe's most important fraud-prevention settings are OFF by default.\n\nHere's the 3-minute fix to protect yourself:\n\n* Go to your Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Radar ‚Üí Rules.\n* Find and ENABLE the rules to BLOCK payments if:\n   1. CVC verification fails\n   2. Postal code verification fails\n* For ultimate protection, enable 3D Secure (3DS) in your payment settings. This shifts fraud liability from you to the bank, so you're covered.\n\nI caught it in time, but it was a massive wake-up call. Don't learn this lesson the expensive way.\n\nI wrote a full post-mortem on what happened, the exact fraud pattern to look for, and a step-by-step guide with screenshots on my blog.\n\nFull Story &amp; Guide:¬†[https://choy.in/blog/stripe-is-dangerous](https://choy.in/blog/stripe-is-dangerous)\n\nHope this helps someone avoid a disaster!",

I have a lot of free time and tried everything I could online to turn minutes into dollars, this is the best thing I've found thats worth your time!\n\nWhen companies create / alter product lines.. they want to get a feel for how to general market will enjoy/dislike the product. Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

I completed the qualification and received an email on October 8th about completing an identity verification process in order to stay on Project Sonic and receive pay.\n\nPoint is, I completed the qualification task and identity verification shortly after receiving said email.\n\nI never got an email confirming that I could start working on Project Sonic (it was mentioned in the qualification email that I would get a follow-up email indicating whether I passed or not). However, when I go to the Multimango platform and login using the provided credentials from TelusInternational, I can see tasks that are available to work on (again similar to Project Coffee on Crowdgen). Does this mean I could start working now? It'd really help considering Project Coffee has been paused for many users (including myself) while they undergo quality reviews.\n\nIf I can start working on the project, how exactly will I be paid? I don't think I was able to add any payment information on my TelusInternational account nor was I prompted to use any app.\n\nAny advice/help would be appreciated.",

Some of them failed, some of them did alright, some of them did quite well.\n\nFast forward to today: I've been doing KDP for over a year now, 14 months to be precise and in that time I went from living in my car to having a full blown business with 4 full time employees.\n\nFor anyone unfamiliar Amazon KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing) is Amazon's self publishing platform where you can sell paperbacks, hard cover books, ebooks, and even audio books (through ACX). It doesn't require any upfront investment.  \nIs there a learning curve? Yes.  \nIs it worth it? ABSOLUTELY.\n\nAnd in my opinion this is one of the best and easiest online business models right now, especially for beginners, because:\n\n* You don't need to be a writer\n* You don't need a big budget\n* You can work from anywhere\n* You get access to Amazon's traffic (instead of paying for ads)\n* The books that you made continue to sell almost passively\n\nKDP isn't a \"get rich quick\" scheme, but if you're willing to learn, experiment and stay consistent, it can genuinely change your life, just like it did mine. A year ago I had nothing, today I own a real business that is still growing.\n\nI hope you guys give it a try and have success with it! YOU CAN DO IT!",

Look at what you were paying yourself annually (including distributions).  Are you going to be able to pay yourself that (plus inflation) through grow on that $3m?  A rule of thumb is to target 7.5% growth: 4% to live on; 3.5% as a healthy hedge against inflation. If that 4% (~$120k in this case) is not enough to live on then, as crazy as it might sound, you do need to figure out your next move.\n\nI presume you have a No Compete, so you can take that term and think about what you could've done better and/or more efficiently.

A startup crisis is when I enter my state of flow - for months at a time. And I‚Äôve seen shiiiiit. Ousting cofounders, laying off the entire company, rebuilding it with the right people, SVB crashing with all our funds in it. Running out of money then raising a million in the knick of time. Making every mistake in the book (as a first time founder). And of course evolving and maturing the company.\n\nI still make time for getting 8-10 hours of sleep in every night plus power naps midday as needed to keep my brain high performing. I make time to visit friends across the US, go to the beach, go hiking, 12 hour long thermal journeys. I dont miss important family functions. I also chose to prioritize starting a business over starting a family. Even as a woman - I am in no rush to motherhood because I strategically froze my eggs so that I can give myself the chance to amass the resources I‚Äôd need to create the environment I‚Äôd want to raise a child, that results from my entrepreneurial endeavors.  \n\nYou have to be inherently resilient and you have to have develop attunement for where your energies are best place vs where you hand something to an advisor or mentor to do for you (or have them find the right person for you to do it).\n\nYou are either made for it or you‚Äôre not. And trust me - you literally have to be a little not normal, a little neurodivergent, a little something unusual about how your mind works to be really good at it.\n\nIt‚Äôs the HARDEST thing I‚Äôve ever done and I‚Äôd choose it every time. Well, unless the other options were like ‚Äúbe born into a royal family‚Äù or ‚Äúbe born to super wealthy people‚Äù but even then I‚Äôd still choose entrepreneurship and use my birth wealth lol üòÇ",

It felt like a loss at the time but that imbalance of power never leads to good business. With hindsight, I'd probably try to introduce premiums for specific bad behaviour (e.g. last minute request fee) and stick to them religiously. Then if the customer leaves, they leave. If they stay they'll be incentivised to behave better, and who knows, maybe they will (if not you can keep increasing those premiums).

It has been very rare that we have come across a client that finds this unreasonable. No one gives full access. It is not wise to make emotional decisions or to go at a client with blame. Just be professional; the vast majority of humans will react in a professional manner. Good communication and quick feedback is the key. Best of luck to you.",

A+ clients. We are an accountancy firm. We have January government deadlines here in the UK. Some clients will always drag their feet leading to a scramble at the end of the month and penalties for late filing. We put in a surcharge system for clients who did not meet our internal deadlines leading to better processes and stress come January. Its worked and we have decided to implement elsewhere - weeding out the clients who didnt fall into line with our way of working. It hasnt impacted revenue and we have in fact picked up more clients who are happy to know our structure and boundaries.\n\nPut a plan into place so that you dont just have a good chunk of revenue coming from  one client - line up some time to market and pick up a few extra, less stressful clients that can equate to the revenue stream you get from this one client\n\notherwise - Go for it",

That you need to stand up for yourself.\n\nSo far most proposed solutions seem to fall into the camp of 'train the client to act better'.\n\n**Why not consider hiring someone to manage their account?**\n\nThe result will be the same. *You* make less money today. But you'll gain time to look for new clients, increase your overall revenue and when you're ready you can decide what to do with this customer. If they leave, you have an already trained employee you know can/will deal with difficult customers.\n\nRather than shrink the problem, try to grow your way out of it.\n\nEither way you're going to be stressed - stressed dealing with this customer (even at higher rates) or stressed trying to find new ones to make up 50% of your revenue. The difference is you already know what dealing with this customer is like.\n\nAnd I suspect at least part of your stress is that you feel a bit helpless/trapped with the options you're considering - keep dealing with a bad customer or lose half my revenue. Of course that's an awful option set.\n\nTurn this situation into an opportunity to grow your business instead of trying to decide which punch in the face to take.",

He had a software business as well to help scheduling as he hated the scheduling software he saw that was available back then, so he made his own. \n\nHe eventually paid off the parent's home and made a massive business before selling it in the Boston area. He then decided to go to college to focus on his goals and safety net. He went to Stanford for college for fun and now is working as a contractor to Google and other tech companies around the silicon valley.\n\nHe was 16 when he paid off his parents home. 18 when he bought a house in California because he wanted to be able to walk to Stanford and planned to sell it after college (but I think he actually rented it to other parents who used it instead for their kids in the school) and now he owns homes all over the world and works with something in the tech industry with multiple billion dollar companies. He was a super millionaire and geeky but lives mostly in Portola valley now where he built a house for his mom and him on the same land. Definitely was the momma boy. I have lost connection with him but was shocked how he was making millions and yet... Took a bus or biked around because he hated the upkeep of cars. He said he went through too many cars with Boston snow for his mom to get around. You would have never known he was super successful and already owned million dollar homes.",

I hired a guy that intentionally told me he was the general manager of a small company, and said he \"knew the owners and might be able to connect us for some work\". Then when I brought him on he let it out that it was actually a failed business that he had started and ran. I let him go immediately for the lack of integrity (he also claimed qualifications he did not have). Honesty is the best policy in my opinion. I don't know what you do or what your company was, but if you are thoughtful about how you frame it I guarantee there is a positive spin in there somewhere for you.",

I move back and fourth pretty seemlesly when nessecary. Here's how. Skip the app/resume and go over the probably worthless ass manager who will snub anyone they consider a threat. Chatgpt a half sales pitch half job request email and send it to preferbly the owner of the business. They actually have a profit motive to hire talent. Send email then follow with a call. Hit em with your pitch and include your relavent experince and ability to execute on a level unmatched by the rest of their team proven by income through your own business. Be a \"disruptor.\" Use hackenyed business non-fiction phrases like that in your pitch. Think Sun tzu, 7 habits, getting to yes, Kizen etc that will be relatable. If they then ask for a resume afterwards use your one kernel of relevant experience and make up some awesome sounding bullshit from businesses that you worked for that are now sold/bankrupt. (check venture cap failure rates and business succes rates to know how large a pool this is to play in.) Have your one good reference from the job and then two professional sounding friends confirm your bullshit. Its not flawless but damn is it effective. Way better success rate then the path set out for the chimps. I can usually get a above avg salary in my desired field in 3-4 calls. Don't really have to do it often as I can back up my bs with talent in the field and will do my own research to fill in any holes I have.

I keep reminding myself why I am building my start-up. At this point, getting a 'good exit' is not even at the top of the list (although that would be nice!). I have started this to solve a problem and need to see it through.\n\n2.  See if you can build a 'support system' - I have a buddy who is also going through a similar journey and we have agreed to keep talking to each other about our pain points. \n\n3. Listen to your body - at least as a solopreneur, I have some degree of freedom with my schedule. I usually listen to  energetic music when i work or go workout, shower, etc. when I need a break. Sometimes I even take a nap in the middle of the day and then slog it out late in the night. The key is to understand what keeps you in your productive zone most of the time and try to do more of that. High Productivity/Passion =&gt; Less Stress.\n\n4. Have something that you can look forward to. For me, I keep (kept? - more below) my Friday evenings to just unwind with my favorite food and drink. I'm back at it first thing Saturday morning, but Friday evening is my time. Through out the week, I imagine myself sitting on the couch on Friday evening and ask myself 'what do I need to accomplish before Friday, that will help me enjoy it more?' and the work towards that.\n\n5. Go Public! Recently, I went public with my startup on LinkedIn (nerve wracking, yes), but that is driving a new level of accountability that I don't even want to do my Friday ritual anymore (LOL). It is not just the fear of public failure, but also the motivation from listening to people's problems and how I am working to solve those.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nPS: Yes, I have read Tim Ferris' \"4-Hour Work Week\", but haven't truly figured out how to make it work for my situation.",

I‚Äôd also request to know immediately what else is faked because you cannot afford the ramifications from any other fake work unless you know about it and can start containing or mitigating the impact. Depending on what you find, there could be a risk of customer loss or worse litigation.\n\nOnce that is out of the way, you should decide if you want to let them work towards rebuilding trust. IMO it must NOT be a simple just trust them but rather they‚Äôd need to agree to not represent artificial data as real and work under additional scrutiny into their output which you can slowly reduce as trust is rebuilt. This is not just for the benefit of knowing if they are trustworthy but also to really drive home the point on how sacred trust is.",

      "selftext": "\nWhen I first started buying companies, I didn‚Äôt have investors, fancy financing, or any kind of silver spoon. What I did have was time, curiosity, and a willingness to talk to business owners who wanted to retire. Over time I figured out that most people selling good companies don‚Äôt care about finding the highest bidder. They care about finding someone who will take care of what they built. That shift in thinking is what made everything possible.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned from actually buying businesses with limited capital in 2025.\n\nI look for companies that are simple and steady. No hype. No startups(unless we think we can make something work with the existing owner staying on full time). I like plumbing, concrete, restoration, logistics, small manufacturing, marketing agencies with retainers, and local service companies that people rely on every week. They‚Äôre not glamorous, but they make consistent money and they‚Äôve usually been run by the same person for twenty or thirty years. Those owners are tired. They want to slow down, but they also want to know their employees and customers will be taken care of.\n\nI build my own list. I pick an industry, use Google Maps, and write down every company that looks active. Then I just reach out. I‚Äôll call or email the owner and say something like, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôve followed your business for a while and really respect what you‚Äôve built. I own and operate a couple small companies and was wondering if you‚Äôve ever thought about stepping back or bringing someone on to help with the next stage.‚Äù That‚Äôs it. No big sales pitch. Just a human conversation.\n\nMost people say no the first time and second time. Some never call back. But a few will talk. And those few conversations are where all the good deals come from. I keep track of everyone I contact and follow up every few months. Timing is everything.\n\nOnce a conversation turns serious, structure matters more than anything. I‚Äôve used seller financing in nearly every deal I‚Äôve done. One deal went like this: $1 million purchase price, $100k down, $500k SBA loan, and the seller carried $400k at five percent interest for five years. They liked the idea of getting paid over time instead of walking away. It gave me enough breathing room to run the business right.\n\nIf I don‚Äôt have the down payment, I find a partner who‚Äôs comfortable lending it in exchange for interest or a small profit share. I keep control by structuring it as a loan, not equity. That kind of creativity gets deals done without losing ownership. That said I always want an active partner. No passive guys - not worth the headache. \n\nI always talk to banks before I need them. I‚Äôll call local SBA lenders and ask what they like to see from borrowers. They‚Äôll tell you exactly how they think. That‚Äôs free education. When you finally bring them a real opportunity, you already know how to package it so they can say yes. Also keep in mind some of the local banks aren‚Äôt really SBA. \n\nDue diligence is where most buyers get lazy. I don‚Äôt. I ask for tax returns, bank statements, vendor lists, customer breakdowns, and payroll reports. I compare deposits to income. I verify that employees are real and staying on. I want no surprises after closing.\n\nWhen I negotiate, I care more about structure than price. I‚Äôll ask for a few months of interest-only payments or a transition period where the seller helps part-time. Those little details protect cash flow while you learn. Sellers usually say yes because it helps everyone succeed.\n\nIf you want to get started, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do right now.\n\nWeek 1: pick one or two industries you understand. Build a list of 25 businesses in your area.\nWeek 2: call or email 10 owners. Get two real conversations.\nWeek 3: ask one of them for basic financials. Build a rough deal model just to practice.\nWeek 4: talk to one SBA lender and ask what it would take to fund a deal like that.\n\nThen repeat the cycle every month. If you stay consistent for 90 days, you‚Äôll have real leads, real numbers, and one or two sellers who are thinking about it.\n\nBuying a business with limited capital isn‚Äôt magic. It‚Äôs process, patience, and communication. The 2025 market is full of retiring owners who want someone capable to take over. If you can listen, plan, and follow through, you can become that person.\n\nIf anyone wants to talk through how to start, how to reach out to sellers, or what to look for in a deal, drop your questions. I‚Äôm happy to share what‚Äôs worked for me.\n\nDr Connor Robertson",

I have started and lost businesses, had marketplace accounts shut down, and poured a year into a project that failed, and that cycle taught me to favor steady, repeatable systems over chasing quick wins. I also spent years bouncing between ideas, battled binge drinking, and have been maintaining sobriety while rebuilding focus, so I know how clarity and structure feel when they finally click. I once found purpose again coaching kids, and that piece of meaning helped me steady my next moves. I share that because your approach of listening to retiring owners and valuing structure resonates with how I rebuilt my work life. \n\nHere are simple, concrete steps you can use right away: start by building a local list of 25 businesses and use a short, human outreach script to get two real conversations this month, talk to at least one lender now to learn what documents they need so you can model a clean deal later, insist on seller financing or convert a partner contribution into a loan so you keep control while preserving cash flow, and create a due diligence checklist to verify payroll, deposits, and customer concentration before you sign. Keep notes, follow up every 90 days, and protect a short transition period with interest only payments while you learn the business. I admire your patience and the listening mindset you described, and if you want to run a real outreach script or a deal model together I am happy to help. Small consistent actions win. \n\nAustin Erkl - Entrepreneur Coach",

          "body": "Yeah we actually get better results with email and LinkedIn than we do with calling, I assume because it‚Äôs easier to ignore an email or LinkedIn message than tell a good cold caller to fuck off. 300 isn‚Äôt a ton of emails, and getting one or two good replies off that seems reasonable. The thing is that when you use list building tools and a good deliverability setup you can easily send thousands of emails per month and convert anywhere from 0.5%-5% to warm leads depending on how targeted and exciting your offer is. Say 10% of the warm leads buy, you back into needing to send 1,000 emails and talk to 10 people to close a deal. Call that $500 in tech costs and a day of work to net a deal. If you‚Äôre shooting for the standard grifter/new B2B service rate of $1,500 all in first contract value this puts you in the money as long as you have decent COGS. I would avoid email for B2C services and anything with less than $1K LTV in terms of gross profit - so once you‚Äôve netted out your expenses to fulfill the service your price needs to be $1,000 more than that. Assuming your customers will eventually buy again if they have success, or some sort of recurring relationship, worst case you‚Äôre shooting to conservatively break even on the initial contract once you factor in COGS and CAC and a fair market value for your time spent selling and seeking to profit off of retentions referrals and upsells.\n\nShoot for 95% deliverability, 30-40% open rates, and 25% of your replies being positive. Any metric substantially below these is killing you. Too much bounce -&gt; spam. Nobody opens your email -&gt; spam. People aren‚Äôt happy they got it -&gt; also spam. Keep in mind there‚Äôs an artificial 10% open rate baseline generated by programmatic clicks such as the inbox scanning links for malicious activity - so a 10% open rate means nobody is opening your email and a 20% open rate means 10% of people are. This is why youre shooting for 30-40 and 20% isn‚Äôt as good as it looks. If your bounce rate is over 5% scrub with neverbounce and keep valid emails and catch all emails, discard invalids and unknowns. End your emails with a question geared to start a conversation instead of asking for a meeting if response rates/happy responses are feeling too low.",

      "selftext": "I am a Radiation Protection Tech and I get contracted out by nuclear power plants. I work 5 months on and take 7 months off. I make about $120,000 a year for easy work.\nI use to be a massage therapist before nuclear and ran a business that garnered 100 or so members in a year and a half. I was doing great running that with my brother until Covid shut us down.\n\nSo I jumped into nuclear and have been working it ever since- I deceived to take the time off that I have build something new and solve a big problem.\nI‚Äôm currently trying to onboard as many people into nuclear as possible so I can use that money to start my own contracting company for nuclear. \n\nI have an interesting job! If anybody has any questions just ask me and I‚Äôll explain away!",

The Youtube, TikTok and social media game is oversaturated that's like saying everyone is successful in the music or entertainment industry. This is an entire industry totally based on \"faking it until you make it\". Everything is performative, and many sell their soul for it.\n\nThe YouTube, TikTok, and social media game is oversaturated; that's like saying everyone is successful in the music or entertainment industry.\n\nBefore the Influencer was a thing, everyone was a singer, rapper, producer, and everyone had a record label. But when you look at Billboard, there were only the Top 100 or even 200. So, out of all these people, only 200 artists actually \"charted\"; the rest were struggling.\n\nThat's the same with social media; you have a few that fooled people into paying them thousands to give them a course on how to get rich. Why would they do that if they are already rich? If they have a successful company, they would focus on that, invest their money, and just do what they enjoy.\n\nMost of these \"public figures\" are conmen or women. They sell you a dream, and you go home with that dream, and you're going to continue working your job you hate.\n\nMany of these million-follower influencers live with 4 roommates and owe people money. That's the game.\n\nMaking money is hard if you do it the right way, not by scamming, stealing, or committing fraud.\n\nThe Liver King sold everyone on eating raw organ meat to think they could be shredded like him, but then came to find out he has been taking massive steroids forever. So much from eating raw organ meats. I could go down the line of all these frauds that cheat people out of money and are now being investigated, and will be doing time\n\nTai Lopez is now under investigation for running a Ponzi scheme the entire time.

The more frequent the problem the better. As Alex Hormozi says look for pain that happens every day or every week not once a year. That way your business lives in people‚Äôs day to day life not their once a year wish list.\n\nJeff Bezos used to say build around things that never change. People will always want convenience trust good service and something that saves them time or makes them feel good. When you build for what stays true you don‚Äôt need to chase trends. Build around those timeless needs instead of chasing trends.\n\nAnd because you‚Äôre introverted we already have the patience to think deeply and build quietly. That‚Äôs a strength. We don‚Äôt need to shout just solve something meaningful and let your work speak. We just need to help a few people really well.\n\nStart small. Observe deeply. Build patiently.

          "body": "Being introverted isn't an excuse for not doing business. Plenty of successful introverts run companies, they just approach customer interaction differently than extroverts. Stop using it as a reason not to start.\n\nYou don't need marketing expertise before starting, you learn by doing. Start by selling something to people you already know, get feedback, iterate. That's how everyone learns marketing, not by studying theory first.\n\nFor actually starting as a beginner: identify something you're good at or interested in, find 10 people who might need that thing, reach out and offer it to them, see if anyone bites. That validates whether there's demand before you invest time building infrastructure.\n\nOur clients who overthink \"how to start\" before doing anything usually never start. They research endlessly, plan perfectly, then get paralyzed by fear. Just pick something small and try selling it to one person. That teaches you more than any advice.\n\nCollege students have built-in advantages for starting businesses. You have a network of peers, low living expenses, and time to experiment. Use those instead of focusing on limitations like being introverted.\n\nCommon beginner businesses for college students: freelance services (writing, design, tutoring), dropshipping or selling products online, campus-focused services. Pick something with low startup costs so failure doesn't hurt financially.\n\nStop looking for permission or the perfect plan. Just start selling something, even if it's imperfect. You'll learn what works through real experience way faster than reading about how to start.\n\nBeing introverted might actually help because you'll focus on systems and processes instead of relying purely on personality to sell. Plenty of successful online businesses run by introverts who never meet customers face-to-face.\n\nPick something, offer it to 10 people, see what happens. That's your starting point, not endless research on how to begin.",

The whole promise is minimal effort (‚Äúget started in a day‚Äù) and boom, you have a $50,000 a month business. \n\nI‚Äôm not saying that there is no potential for success using any of these mediums - but rather there is soooo much work, research, and understanding of the customer that goes into forming a successful, and more importantly, lasting business.\n\nThere‚Äôs a reason why there are more 9-5 workers than business owners. A tale as old as time: ‚ÄúIf it were easy, everyone would do it‚Äù. \n\nTherefore, if you are trying to rush things because you are feeling left out of the ‚ÄúAI gold rush‚Äù or whatever the new ‚Äúbig opportunity‚Äù is, just remember business is a marathon, not a sprint as it portrayed so much on the internet today by people simply trying to sell you on a course. \n\nNobody in their right mind putting up those big numbers is going to have the time or energy to start a course and make 3 hour long YouTube videos about it. Remember that. \n\nCorrect me if I‚Äôm wrong on any of this but over the past 5ish years of trial, error, and observation, that has been my understanding.\n",

I just pulled up our Mercury report and here are all the new tools we have been paying for this year\n\n1. Cursor and Windsurf: Everyone in our team gets either Cursor or Windsurf paid for. I am personally a huge fan of Windsurf cascade agent. Its been able to make huge changes to our app on it own from simple prompts. We mostly just have to test the changes, review the code and just push it to deployment lately. Our team is moving definitely 2x faster with the same headcount. We use the Sonnet model almost unanimously inside our old!\n2. Google Nano Banana &amp; Veo 3: We used to hire contractors to make product images, photoshoots, videos for social media/ads etc. Google Nano Banana has mostly replaced all of that. It is great how it can take a product and change colors etc, and turn it into full blown photoshoots with models etc in seconds. And then you can just use it as a first frame in Veo 3 to make a full video/reel from it. Crazy!\n3. Frizerly: Its a great AI agent that learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website helping us improve our Google ranking. Saves me and my team 10+ hours every week!¬†We used to hire contractors on Fiverr/Upwork earlier for this!\n4. Intercom Fin: We had an issue where whatever we do and document on our website, people kept asking some obvious questions on chat taking up valuable support bandwidth. Now Fin can auto resolve these questions instantly. Other questions get auto routed to real people so that people are not mad as well!¬†!¬†\n5. Lovable &amp; Bolt: Our marketing team now quickly spins up landing pages, lead gens using Lovable/Bolt instead of having to wait for engineering or external contractors. It's not great complex apps for SAAS etc but it's great for marketing landing pages, and simple stuff!¬†\n6. ChatGPT: Obvious, but everyone in our team gets ChatGPT to brainstorm, summarize reports etc\n7. N8N: To automate lots of workflows inside our org.\n\nCurious what others are using tho!",

Now everything flows through n8n, from Smartlead data to Slack summaries. Each AM saves around 6 hours a week.\n2. **Supabase + Clay:** Our Apollo data lives inside Supabase, and Clay is our main research engine. It enriches and segments leads automatically instead of relying on VAs. Lead quality and positive replies both went up noticeably.\n3. **Claude + Claude Projects:** We use Claude for thinking, writing, and debugging ideas. Its Projects feature is perfect for keeping consistent tone across client reports and campaign analyses. It replaced hours of doc writing and alignment calls.\n4. **Lovable / Codex / Cursor / Bolt:** Still experimenting with these to build our internal reporting and client dashboards. The goal is a fully ‚Äúvibecoded‚Äù platform that looks great but runs straight on live campaign data from our DB.\n5. **Slack + custom bots:** Every campaign‚Äôs health, domain status, and weekly CDRs now post directly to Slack. No dashboards to check, no files to pull. Keeps the team synced in real time.\n\nThis year has been more about wiring everything together using the small pieces that have been out in the market and gained enough stability to not break our systems. \n\nOverall, all of this implmented results in the systems running smoothly and the team focussing only on thinking and strategy.",

A rich couple walking their dog walked up to the while he and I were working on something and asked what we did at the building. My father asked rudely, \"What do you want?\" \n\nThey got the message and walked away. My father was an alcoholic and could be an asshole. I remember feeling embarrassed for his behavior that day. Later in life, I understood better why he ran them off. \n\nHe was a chemical engineer and a lawyer that was too belligerent to be employed by anyone so he was a contractor all his life. His main passion in life was fishing, hunting, and going to the bar to meet his friends, all while drinking of course. \n\nWhat I later figured out is if he gets friendly with the rich couple then maybe they want to borrow tools, ask engineering or legal questions, or inquire about his occupancy permit which he did not have. There's a whole host of possibilities and he already had all the friends that he wanted. The couple had nothing to offer that interested him and was a potential pain in the ass. \n\nHis boundaries and communication skills were atrocious but walking up to non-public warehouse with no sign and asking questions is a good way to be told to tuck off. \n\nI'm far more polite than my father but I've learngymed not to get too friendly, too fast with anyone. Unfortunately, friendly people often end up being a problem and they were being nice to get something or have some type of drama. \n\nNow, I'm the cynical old man and if7 I'm approached in public, the first thing out my mouth is, \"What do you want?\" The next thing is, \"I'm not interested.\" If they still want to talk to me, \"Is this an emergency? Should I call 911?\" It's always no so, \"If it's not an emergency then I don't have time.\" It's the same script every time. \n\nI've learned to keep it short and sweet with my neighbors as well. They have stepped over the line enough that I don't want the hassle. Some of the people with the most integrity and decency that I have met in life were not initially that friendly. I had to earn their trust and respect.",

In fact, [RedwoodSDK](https://rwsdk.com/) is currently in beta on their v1, and makes it REALLY easy to integrate with Cloudflare. Cloudflare is very powerful, but also a pain in the ass to work with when doing non-standard stuff (Vercel is probably going to be the same in all honesty).\n\nFrom personal anecdotal experience, I have [Omae3](https://oma3.vercel.app/) which is a character generator for an RPG called Shadowrun. It's running on Vercel, and I'm too cheap to pay for it. The code for it lives on [github](https://github.com/HeyOmae/OMA3) and the integration was extremely easy to set up. I had to jump through some hoops and set up the deploy on a personal repo, but that's once again, because I'm cheap and don't want to pay them. They also had some very nice metrics until I hit their cap and had to pay them. Which, if this was a business, I'd pay for, but it's a hobby app, that I'm building for the community and I don't give a shit about making money with, so I opted out.\n\nNow, with Cloudflare, I'm hosting 2 static sites ([test2doc.com](https://test2doc.com/) and [dethstrobe.com](https://dethstrobe.com/)) and these were trivial to set up and make integrations with. Which, makes sense, because Cloudflare is a CDN, static resources is kind of their bag.\n\nRedwoodSDK has been interesting, I've worked through their tutorial, which gives a nice CRUD app to build out and use some of Cloudflare's cool tech like durable objects to persist data. And it's very easy to use, but I have ran in to a few small bugs while working locally that forced me to nuke the DB and rebuild and rerun migrations and seeds. It's quick to get back to working state, but I do have some concerns that might be more edge cases since it is so new. But I personally don't mind bleeding a bit while being on the cutting edge.\n\nI guess it depends on how much money you have vs how much tolerance for putting up with integration friction. If you're cheap and don't mind a bit of pain, cloudflare. If you don't mind burning money, but want an easier time vercel.\n\nAlso, just to throw out a few other alternatives. [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is really easy to work with and cheap. I've heard good things about [fly.io](http://fly.io), but I haven't tried them yet. [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) is fantastic and cheap, but you have to set up everything yourself. And of course, there is always the big players like AWS, gCloud, and Azure. But I think big tech is actually a big pain in the ass, honestly not as cheap as the smaller player.",

It's who they are. Typically they are fresh from countries where you DO haggle everything.  They are not bad customers, but they want to haggle. So after that first time I went into my computer and raised their rates 10% for parts and labor.  Then I would let them \"haggle\" me down to my normal rates.

They would have to travel 2 hours north to LA just to get a something a couple dollars cheaper. \n\nWe still get asswipes trying to get a discount. Multiple interactions: \n\n\n\n-*\"If I buy two, will you give me the second for half price?\"*  (Dude...) the guy I sold a 100 units to just now, didn't get a single dollar off. (What makes you think your measly two piece order is going to sway me?) \n\n\n\n-*\"If I buy a dozen, how much will you give it to me for?\"* Same price as labeled (in bold 250 point font on the product itself, need me to read it to you fuck face!?!)  *\"Ok, if I buy ten of these, how much for me?\"* (Again,) if you take one or a hundred, the price is the same. *\"What about if I take 30 pieces of this one, how much for me?\"* (OMFG!!  I start blinking slower and narrow my eyes a bit) If you order a truck container's worth of product, pay it in full up front, and wait 2-3 months, and agree to storage fees if you don't pick up immediately, I can give you a decent discount. \n\n\n\n-*\"But I always get a lower price than this\"* (No one does) Only the boss can give you a discount, he's on vacation, and returns next month, you can come back then. *\"No that's ok, I need it now\"* (If you clean up my inventory at a discount, I too need to replenish now, but my NOW is going to take 2-3 months to get my order from China. So selling at a discount is not to our benefit) \n\n\n\nWhen I start getting tired of them, I actually send them to my competitor without directly saying gtfo. They come back and pay my asking price without any more haggling.\n\nEdit: Just yesterday. I had a guy who was from our same hometown in Syria. Never met him before here. He thinks because we're both Syrian, he's going to convince me with his bullshit. He wanted to invest his money, and take zero risk. That he wanted to take 10 units of our product, he wants it at a discount, AND (here's the kicker) wants it on consignment, so that if he doesn't re-sell the product successfully, he can return it and get his money back even though we have 5 signs All Sales Final and No Returns No Exchange signs spread out across our showroom. This one in particular was kinda fun to knock him off his high horse watching him deflate when I wouldn't budge on any of his negotiation attempts.",

For three years I kept walk in hours because I thought thats what customers wanted and I was terrified of losing business.\n\nThe reality was way different tho. Id have people walk in right when Im in the middle of a hem on a wedding dress, or Id block out time to finish rush orders and then spend 45 minutes with someone who just wanted to ask if I could fix their jacket zipper (which I dont even do). My actual turnaround times were getting worse because I couldnt focus.\n\nI spent like two months researching what other alterations places were doing, talked to my regular customers, even checked polymarket to see what the recession odds were since I was worried people would stop spending on alterations if the economy tanked. But mostly I just tracked my own numbers for a month and realized that 60% of walk ins either didnt book anything or wanted services I dont offer.\n\nMade the switch to appointment only in September. Put up signs, updated my google business, sent emails to my regular clients. First week I was stressed as hell thinking my phone would stop ringing.\n\nOpposite happened. My schedule is actually FULLER now because people book in advance and I can plan my day properly. Im finishing work faster, taking on more jobs, and honestly my stress levels dropped like crazy. Plus the clients who book appointments tend to be more serious and respectful of my time.\n\nOnly downside is I do get the occasional person who shows up anyway and gets annoyed when I cant help them right then. But honestly thats on them for not reading the giant sign on my door lol\n\nIf youre on the fence about this just do it.

Most orgs consider the cost of redundant infrastructure and assume there will be rare outages and that is just the cost of doing business. \n\nBut even when I managed colo in geographically separate data centers no one wanted to pay for true redundancy because it means having the gear hot at independent locations - that's not a cloud problem. \n\nMoreover, that gear is worthless if you aren't routinely testing it and running it as production gear occasionally. \n\nDoctora still have pagers not because they can't get alerts to cell phones, but because it's an i dependent band to be contacted on.

I would usually charge $60 for a project like this but gave her a discount and told her it would be $50. I prefaced it by saying that cost conversations with friends/coworkers can be awkward, but that custom cupcakes are time consuming and then shared the price. She said ‚Äú$50 for 12 cupcakes?!‚Äù My face turned bright red and I was like ‚Äúum yeah‚Ä¶ if you want I can do toppers rather than a custom design and lower the price.‚Äù And then she was like ‚Äúno, I want to showcase your design so it‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll pay the full amount‚Äù as if she is doing me a favor‚Ä¶ \n\nI‚Äôm guessing this is a common experience for small business owners.

Be confident in your pricing. ‚ÄúI usually charge $60, but for you I‚Äôll do it for $50. Sounds fair?‚Äù And let them respond. Your response of adjusting the product to meet their price point was perfect. It gives them options in their price point so they feel like they‚Äôre in the drivers seat.",

      "selftext": "We operate a horseback riding business. Obviously, this requires physical ability and makes people prone to injury as they are getting on/off horses. Over the past few years, we have had families bring elderly relatives - people in their 80s and 90s, some with very frail bones or broken hips. This is extremely dangerous as they cannot easily get on/off the horse. Some of them are so immobile they cannot even walk from their cars to our staging area let alone get on a horse.\n\nToday we had an elderly fall off the horse and smash her head open.\n\nI want to be able to legally refuse service to people in such a condition. Here is the problem, federal law (Age Discrimination Act of 1975) does not permit us to discriminate based on age or disability. So we are in a gray area here.\n\nI do not want elderly people who are physically immobile to use our service and if they show up I want to be able to legally deny them, but I do not want to violate federal discrimination laws (such as Age Discrimination Act of 1975) and get sued. Are there any out clauses in the law that we can use for denying service based on it being say \"a risk to that person's safety\" or something? Of course I don't know if we are subject to federal age discrimination laws as we are a private company and do not receive federal funding.\n\nDoes anyone know a way around this. I'm thinking if we make a 'safety and risk' policy for ALL customers instead of just elderly that would work. Any info would be appreciated.\n\n  \nWe do have liability waivers customers sign but I still do not want people getting injured.",

The course had spaces that blocked bodies of all ages who couldn't complete the course and we had an addendum you had to sign that if you get \"stuck' we would be rescuing you with our privately owned rescue services for $3000 an hour. \n\nWe reduced our course completion failure from 20% to 1% and increased our revenue because despite stopping a good amount of people from buying tickets, the ones who didn't make it through the obstacle course or decided not to go up with their group, they still bought pizza and played coin operated games instead of shutting down the course and blubbering for 45 minutes as our team dragged them back down the mountain. \n\nIf I were you, I'd buy a big draft horse statue and require all participants to climb over it to qualify for the riding experience. Add in that you can make exceptions to this rule if needed and then you can quietly let kids or anyone you need to skip the requirement but not great aunt Agnes. \n\nHere is the most important part though, set up a nice waiting area so Agnes has something to do somewhere. Mount a TV in the tack room, add a few chairs and play Seabiscuit on a loop. Psychologically no one wants Agnes on the horse they just don't want her sitting in a hot car while they have fun. If you give her a chair and a vending machine somewhere they will ditch her there and feel zero pressure to put her on a horse. It doesn't have to be fancy it just has to look like whoever doesn't go riding will have somewhere to be that is shaded and comfortable. \n\nWe started with just a few seats and a shelf of books and eventually built it up to a pay-fridge, microwave and some pinball machines which paid for themselves immediately.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm posting here to warn all entrepreneurs, freelancers, and small businesses using Wise Business.\n\nMy account was closed today, October 17, after more than 3 weeks of absurd exchanges with their so-called ‚Äúcompliance‚Äù team.\n\nI currently have ‚Ç¨50,000 frozen, with no access, no refund date, and no concrete explanation.\n\n How it all started\n\nAt the end of September, I received a standard email:\n\n‚ÄúWe need to verify the source of your company‚Äôs funds.‚Äù\n\nNothing unusual at first.\n\nI provided every possible document:\n\nCompany registration documents\n\nClient contract + invoices\n\nBank statements\n\nSWIFT message\n\nHandwritten loan agreement and proof of family loan for starting capital\n\nA full explanation of the company structure and income source\n\nEverything was clear, traceable, and consistent.\n\nThen the nightmare began\n\nFor 3 weeks, I received emails from six different agents (each time a new name, each time ignoring the conversation history).\n\nEach one asked for the same documents again, just worded differently:\n\n‚ÄúPlease send external bank statements.‚Äù (already done)\n\n‚ÄúExplain the origin of the capital.‚Äù (already explained 3 times)\n\n‚ÄúProvide your tax declaration.‚Äù (impossible, new company)\n\n‚ÄúSend the payslips of your relatives who helped fund you.‚Äù (??)\n\nEvery time, I took the time to explain, reformat files, add more proof, and provide detailed explanations.\n\nI gave them everything, black and white.\n\nAnd still ‚Äî nothing moved forward.\n\nüö® October 17: sudden account closure\n\nThis morning, I received the following message:\n\n‚ÄúYour account has been closed. You can appeal and wait 30 days.‚Äù\n\nNo reason given.\n\nNo summary of their decision.\n\nNo timeline to recover my funds.\n\nResult:\n\n\\- ‚Ç¨50,000 frozen\n\n\\- Business operations halted\n\n\\- Dozens of detailed emails ignored, no clear response\n\n\\- My opinion after this experience\n\nWise is no longer a reliable solution for professionals.\n\nThey act like a bank ‚Äî but without transparency, accountability, or logic.\n\nTheir compliance team feels robotic, demanding contradictory and absurd documents, often impossible for small businesses to provide.\n\nAnd the worst part: they can shut down your account without warning, even if your file is clean.\n\nHonestly, it‚Äôs shameful.\n\nI regret ever trusting them.\n\nIf your business relies on Wise ‚Äî withdraw your funds while you still can.\n\n‚ùìQuestions for the community\n\nHas anyone else here had their Wise account closed with money stuck inside?\n\nHow long did it take before you got your funds back?",

          "body": "To value a business you look at the past several year's average free cash flow (how much money truly available to spend, so not profit) and then divide that by the relative risk of the business (20% for a super super low risk business, 40%+ for a high risk business). That's basically it, the hard part is determining appropriate free cash flow and risk. You can subtract the expected continued growth rate from risk if you'd expect it to keep growing. \n\nYou say 1.1 in profit, are there any costs not included in that? Does that include your salary (fair market to replace you?). Let's say it's actually $900k in free cash flow this year, but an average of $800k over the last 3 years. So let's say your business grows ~10% every year and can reasonably expect that to continue. \n\nIt's a website, that has inherent risk as it's very low barrier to entry for competitors. How vital are you to the success so far? Losing you would be risky. If I had to guess, id think an investor would determine maybe a 35% risk rating. \n\nTherefore the value in this example is: $800k/(0.35-0.1) = $3.2M. You can play with those numbers as you want, but you'll have to convince an investor why they are different. Hopefully this semi helps you understand how to value your/any business.",

Now that we have grown significantly and have 2 locations, it is way harder to understand where exactly the profit is being sucked out from. I have Google spreadsheets that I use to categorize expenses, but it is much harder for me to get a read on deposits, specifically for places like TikTok and Amazon that can take weeks or even a month to pay out. \n\nDoes anyone have a suggested software to use so I can get a full read on what‚Äôs coming in and out?

You can set up bank rules to help automate recurring expense transactions which will save you time on any backdated work too. From here you‚Äôll also be able to report on your P&amp;L and cash flow and drill down into the detail behind any numbers.\n\nA2X - this is the app we recommend to pull your Amazon payouts analysis through into Xero in a useful and meaningful way. It will help you to analyse the payouts between revenue and the various fees. You can also go further in your analysis and look by country or product category. If you have TikTok synced to Shopify, you‚Äôd also be able to use A2X to analyse those sales too. Otherwise, there are other apps available you can look at for a direct Xero-TikTok sync.\n\nBriefcase - this is an AI first bookkeeping app that will enable you to capture and process all of your purchase invoices and the detail from them through in to Xero.\n\nHow confident are in you in the accuracy of your current spreadsheet analysis, is it delivering proper accrual based accounting reports for you? It‚Äôs often e-commerce businesses can think they‚Äôre loosing money but will actually just be cash negative - particularly if you‚Äôve got too much money tied up in stock.",

      "selftext": "inb4; sorry for polishing with AI - my English is not the best tbh that was the only way to share the story.\n\nI'm 27 now.  \nWhen I was 26, I started a small restaurant business with a friend. We built it from scratch concept, branding, design, suppliers, operations I was handling everything day to day.\n\nThe place was actually a¬†huge success traffic-wise, but the financial calculations my business partner made were way off ‚Äî our prices were too low, and we were too busy to notice. I trusted his numbers because he already owned another food place, and I assumed he knew what he was doing.\n\nThen a new investor came in. He seemed smart, calm, and experienced ‚Äî about twenty years older than me. After he sent the first part of the money he promised, we finally sat down together to go through the numbers. That‚Äôs when we both realized how bad things really were.\n\nMy first partner told me,¬†*‚ÄúIf we ever leave this business, we leave it together.‚Äù*  \nThat didn‚Äôt happen. He stayed.\n\nThe new investor set¬†completely unrealistic conditions¬†- he wanted me to pay him back¬†**around $25,000 within a year**, which was impossible. On top of that, he tried to trick me into working under him, basically making me his employee in the same business I had built. Staying in that deal would‚Äôve forced me to abandon my first company ‚Äî the one I‚Äôd been building for years ‚Äî just to pay off someone else‚Äôs mistake.\n\nHe kept the brand, both locations, and gave me zero chance to get my money back ‚Äî not even for the equipment and stuff I had personally bought to make the place work. I got completely burned out, financially and mentally destroyed.\n\nI lost around¬†**$20,000‚Äì$22,500**¬†personally.  \nI went through months of therapy and sessions with a psychiatrist because I simply couldn‚Äôt cope with it. I‚Äôm currently on raising doses of Brintellix and trying to get my shit back together ‚Äî which is not easy. Oh man, it‚Äôs not.\n\nAlmost all of my debts are paid off now, but this thing burned the hell out of me.  \nI still have another business that I‚Äôve been running for six years, but it‚Äôs only bringing around¬†**$5,500/month**, which in my country isn‚Äôt much.\n\nI used to have some safe investments ‚Äî ETFs, bonds, even gold but I really wanted to finally make a proper living doing something bigger. Instead, I got lied to, manipulated, and scammed.\n\nEvery day feels like a fight with myself. I know logically I‚Äôm out of the worst part, but emotionally, it feels like I‚Äôve lost everything.\n\nEdit. I wanted to go legal, but after some thinly veiled threats in person, I didn‚Äôt feel safe to pursue it then.\n\nHas anyone here gone through something similar?  \nHow did you rebuild your self-trust and your wallet?  \nDid you manage to truly recover from something like this?",

I'd say for you... never have a partner again ever.\n\nThe bad thing is... you didn't just screw yourself with 1 partner... when it was getting bad, you jammed it back in a second time. When it comes to partners there is usually no lube and it will sting for awhile but you will recover. Business is a big boy's game. You will be fine. By Spring (In America) you will have new thoughts and moving forward. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;",

So focus on what you have: Knowledge! Still, hopefully your health as well. And get started again. It‚Äôs actually a great place to be with a fresh start knowing that you have the entire future ahead of you and now you‚Äôre stronger. This didn‚Äôt take you out.

You are so young, and you seem to have drive and desire to ustle and make things happen. Take the lessons learned and move on as a smarter, better businessperson. Do not dwell on the mistakes and failures, dwell on the lessons the teach you. There are countless examples of successful people who failed time and time again. It's simply part of the process sometimes. \n\nAnd so you know, I too lost a business this year, several actually, that I was part of creating. It's a story of betrayal and deceit and I feel so embarrassed and stupid because i feel like I let it happen. But the truth is they were the bad actors, and they plotted with others to make this happen and i have to remeber it's not my fault. just as your situation isn't your fault. You are part of it, but there is always plenty of \"blame\" to spread around!! It cost me in the hundreds of thousands and my retirement savings leaving me to start over in my late 50's. So please know that you are so young and have time to make anything you want to happen a reality. It's all just beginning for you. After some time for the shock to wear off and consulting criminal attornies, it;s come down for me that there's little I can do. Even if I were to \"win\", the time and cost to get there is daunting when I am now left with no resources. If I lose, I have no way to pay. If I win everything 100% then it's good, but very unlikely to happen. Its most likely a middle ground would be reached and then they really could just file bankruptcy and I would still have nothing. So all there is for me is to move on, becuase bitterness gets me nothing. I know the lesson I learned. I'm not sure there is time to rebuild what I once had, but I can try to build something from this tragedy. \n\nI know for you like me it's the feeling about losing something I created that has been stolen from me that hurts more than the money in some way. You have to let that become a driver that pushes you forward. Let it remind you why you make the decisions you make as you enter new ventures. Protect yourself first. I didn't do that. I always trust people too much. I paid the price because people just are not as loyal as I am. It's a lesson that has come back to haunt me twice in my life. Some day I will learn???

He wasn‚Äôt lazy or unskilled. At the beginning he was one of the most reliable people on the team. But over time something shifted. Tasks took longer, communication became distant, and it started to feel like he was working just to fill hours instead of driving things forward.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt dramatic or toxic, just that slow fade where motivation disappears. We tried to talk things through, but nothing really changed. In the end, keeping him on didn‚Äôt feel fair to him or to us.\n\nWhat surprised me most was how heavy it felt afterward. I actually liked the guy, and I kept wondering if I could have done more to help him reconnect. The next day, I spoke with another developer who has been working with us for a while, consistent, reliable, never any drama. I took a moment to thank her for her work, and she seemed genuinely touched.\n\nIt made me realize how often we forget to appreciate the people who quietly do things right until something goes wrong somewhere else.\n\nHave you been through something similar in your business? How did you handle it on your side?",

They don't, and won't, and it's crazy to expect otherwise. No one will ever give a shit about your business as much as the owners of the business, and you can't ever expect them to.\n\nSounds like you let a good relationship end because you couldn't set proper terms.\n\nedit: also generally speaking, sometimes employees are overambitious early on, think of it as the \"honeymoon stage\", they might feel like they have something to prove, or be all starry-eyed, and reality is that it can just fade over time, especially if their expectations are not in line with reality, if they had high hopes for things, and eventually realize that reality is not as glamorous or exciting as they imagined. We all like to gas ourselves up like we're great employers, but sometimes employees also feel undercompensated (and sometimes are actually undercompensated relative to the market) and that's something else that can disillusion them. So it's completely normal to see an employee who was once a star, eventually fade into \"just average\" over time. It sucks but it's normal.",

Mainly focused on web design then started expanding into other services as my clients started requesting (facebook ads, google, funnels, etc.) so I just turned into a full stack agency.\n\nFirst year was hell and really tough but I pushed through and started getting some clients on a recurring basis. Most of them still with me right now.\n\nPricing is different per client some pay 2k/mo while others pay 1.2k or 1.6k depending on the scope.\n\nUp until 5 months ago I was mostly doing everything myself and just recently got some people to help me out.\n\nI have a media buyer who I pay 1.2k/mo for 3 ad accounts he manages for me and a design agency I started paying 1.5k/mo to take over all the creative production and design for me.\n\nMinus other expenses to run the business it brings my profit to around 5k/mo and I feel thays pretty good considering I‚Äôve never seen that money before and I used to make less than 1,600 every month before this business.\n\nSorry about all the details but now to my actual question. I no longer feel the same drive that I used to have when I started my business. \n\nI remember putting in 12+ hours every single day and not being able to sleep because I had so many ideas I wanted to execute. Every day I would wake up excited to get to work. \n\nNow I have to force myself to work. Dealing with clients, messaging, revisions, out of scope requests, etc. is just irritating now. Every time I hear my phone ring with a whatsapp I feel some type of anger and frustration because It‚Äôs going to be some client asking for more things.\n\nAnd I get it sometimes it sucks and you do need to eat shit for a while but I no longer enjoy what I do.\n\nI started the business because I genuinely wanted to help these businesses but now I can‚Äôt find that passion or energy to work again. \n\nSo I‚Äôm wondering if I should eat shit a little longer and see if I can fix things. Maybe focus on systems and what I can do to actually go back to how I felt.\n\nOr if I should listen to this constant dialogue to just close everything down and start something else.\n\nAnd if I‚Äôm just whining too much and being a bitch just tell me straight up. I‚Äôm the type of person that prefers things straight up hahah so won‚Äôt hurt, it‚Äôs encouraged.\n\nIm curious what are any of your thoughts or ideas on what I could do? It would really help.

Try to take a break soon, but not a total disconnect - unplug from the day to day \"tyranny of the urgent\" and spend some time mixed between relaxing and thinking about the things that got you excited in the first place. Catch up on YouTube videos etc whatever content in your niche that you watched when you were hungry early on. Reflect on how you've learned and grown, and rediscover what caught your interest in the first place. Come back with a refreshed perspective. \n\n2) no more WhatsApp. Force your clients to use a professional communication method like email, where things can be categorized, tagged, and prioritized instead of being on call without a salary \n\n3) think about whether your current tier of clients are the kind you want to work with long term. In my experience, the lower end of the market is where most of the needy, micromanaging clients are. If you've got the chops on the team to service upmarket clients, consider raising rates to price out some of the low end. You can take fewer clients for more money and less stress.",

Sharing so maybe someone else avoids this stuff.\n\nFirst mistake was thinking I could handle all the marketing myself. Spent 6 months posting on instagram and running terrible facebook ads. Burned through 15k with almost nothing to show for it. Finally hired someone who knew what they were doing and sales tripled in two months. I should have done that from day one but I was being cheap and thought I could learn it myself.\n\nSecond mistake was going with the cheapest manufacturer. Saved like 30 cents per unit but quality was garbage. Return rate was almost 15 percent and the negative reviews killed us. Took 8 months to recover our reputation after switching to a better supplier. That 30 cents ended up costing me probably 50k in lost sales and returns.\n\nThird one I just learned about this year. Got a legal letter about our website not being accessible to disabled people. Had no idea this was even a thing. The lawyer wanted 20k to settle and we had to scramble to actually fix the site. Apparently this happens to a lot of small ecommerce companies and nobody talks about it until it happens to them.\n\nEach of these felt like they came out of nowhere but looking back there were warning signs I just ignored. The manufacturer thing especially, I knew the quality wasn't great but kept making excuses.\n\nDoes anyone else have surprise expenses from stuff you didn't know you needed to worry about?",

Or how much you are a squad leader after playing CoD?\n\nTake for example [software.inc](http://software.inc) \\- pretty realistic in aspects and perspective, but cuts down the micro- and macro- management you'll need to do during all steps.\n\nAccounting is heavy in most business. It's actually the biggest pain point of any business. In the game it's literally few clicks and \"work on loan application\" &lt;- that loan application is a effing pita which might turn into several years if your books are crap.\n\nYou will have issues with inventory which any game won't show, for example it is easier to hold to old electronics I have instead of selling them off or throwing them out because they expired and if company throws them out then it is extra payment, if you sell it - it will take much more time to post it up and negotiate than you'll make back. Selling to liquidator is easier but you need bulk amount to make it viable financially. So you are stuck with old hardware for plenty of time. In the game you just upgrade it for the price of the new system which is not true in reality.\n\nI'm not even talking about HR or other things like working longer means better results - this is all false.\n\nThe very vital inventory is messed up by default in all games, you don't need to figure out location for everything based on size, material, usage rate etc.\n\nThen don't forget financials are always messed up in games - you have regulations, requirements etc.\n\nI like business games because they are very relaxing for me and easy, because everything is intuitive and straightforward.\n\nIRL you will be fumbled by how many layers there are to very simple things you'd never even think of.\n\nThat is why it is important to start trying business early in your lifetime - first and foremost is ability to zone-out into another charismatic person and talk to people, you'll get tired but you'll be selling to people. Thankfully mine is online only but if it happens offline I'm trying to be the most cheerful person out there (i have resting bitch-face by default though).",

Some customers pay promptly and then some may be 45-60 days and then you have those who make us wait a little longer\n\n  \ngetting paid is important and not knowing exactly what you do it is hard to say if it is standard practice to always paid within 7 days or not(and if that is what they agreed to then they should)\n\n  \nbut maybe someone didn't pay them promptly(not that that is your problem but see how it works?...)\n\n  \ni wouldn't 'fire' the customer over this but in my business...i don't even sweat 3 weeks(not that you shouldn't be upset). Right now the money they owe is the thing most on your mind...and of course the company that owes you likely has more on their plate and maybe you aren't a priority\n\n  \nbut being paid in 30 days is fairly common in business and if that is howt hey want to pay going forward then you have to ask yourself it is worth it. Is it worth having to wait 4-5 weeks for your money? None of us can answer that question\n\n  \na lot of businesses incentivize prompt payment by offering a discount...like you have net 30 terms but give 2% discounts to those who pay within 10 days(as an example)\n\n  \nbut while i get your frustration and I'm sure you could use that money, this is part of being in business and most of us have to deal with cash flow issues from time to time. If you are making 80% of your income with these people, it is up to you.

At the same time, start quietly exploring backup clients, losing 80% of income would hurt, but having options gives you leverage and reduces stress.
