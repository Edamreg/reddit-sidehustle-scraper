      "selftext": "For years I tried everything... Im talking so many different things.. dropshipping, website design, URL website arbitrage,  affiliate programs, freelancing, print-on-demand....you name it. Every time I thought I‚Äôd found ‚Äúthe one,‚Äù I would lose steam out after a few weeks. Sometimes it was because it wasnt for me, other times it was because life got in the way.\n\nNow I‚Äôm 40, and about a year ago (my wife told me about it 4 years ago ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)  I stumbled into something that finally¬†*worked*: UGC, which stands for user-generated content.\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt heard of it, it‚Äôs when regular people (not influencers.. Im just a random normal dude) create videos that brands use for their paid ads or organic social media. No following required, no crazy tech setup, just the ability to film, talk naturally, and understand/follow requests from a brand.\n\nFor me, this clicked because it rewards experience, not youth. The industry is full of younger creators, but many brands actually want creators who look like their real customers. Parents, homeowners, professionals, real people with life experience.\n\nIt took me 5 years of failed side hustles to find something that let me use my personality, storytelling, and creativity and actually get paid for it. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúeasy,‚Äù but it‚Äôs accessible, and it‚Äôs been life changing.\n\nIf you‚Äôre 35+ and still trying to find something that sticks, UGC is worth looking into.. it changed my life and as I was sitting here eating lunch I figured I would share because maybe it could change someone else's too.",

      "selftext": "A few days, I shared a post titled\\*‚ÄúIt took me 5 years to finally make money online and now I‚Äôm finally full time and thriving.‚Äù\\*\n\nSince then, I‚Äôve had hundreds of people reach out asking¬†how to get started in UGC, so I figured I‚Äôd make a road map post breaking it all down.\n\nLet‚Äôs be clear:¬†it‚Äôs not easy.  \nBut it¬†*is*¬†accessible and that‚Äôs the beauty of it.  \nIt‚Äôs just a matter of putting the pieces together and staying consistent.\n\nThat said,¬†UGC isn‚Äôt for everyone.  \nIf you hate being on camera, don‚Äôt like sending emails, negotiating, or doing admin work then this probably isn‚Äôt for you.\n\nAlso, anyone who says¬†*you have to buy a course*¬†to learn ANYTHING is a liar.  \nYou can 100% learn UGC or anything else in this world on your own using posts like this, YouTube, and trial and error.\n\nThat said,¬†courses and mentorships can shorten your learning curve, you‚Äôll learn faster, make fewer mistakes, and have people to lean on when you hit roadblocks.  \nIt‚Äôs optional, but it¬†does¬†speed things up.\n\n# Quick FAQ\n\n* **What is UGC?**¬†‚ÄúUser Generated Content.‚Äù It‚Äôs content (usually short-form video) made by regular people for brands to use in paid ads or organic social posts.\n   * **Do I need followers?**¬†No. Brands care about the quality and relatability of your videos, not your audience size. If they do care about your audience size then its influencer marketing not UGC\n   * **Do I need to show my face?**¬†Not always. Voiceovers, product demos, and unboxing videos are all fair game but in my opinion if you never plan on showing your face I probably wouldn't recommend UGC\n* **What equipment do I need?**¬†Your phone and a tripod. A lav mic and LED light (each around $20) are great bonuses.\n* **Do I need experience?**¬†No. You‚Äôll learn as you go. Brands care more about energy, clarity, and authenticity.\n* **What age can do it?**¬†All ages and the industry really needs more people**35+**¬†right now.\n* **Do I need to be good-looking?**¬†Nope. The more¬†normal and relatable¬†you are, the better.\n* **Will my friends/family see my videos?**¬†Probably one day. So only create content for products you‚Äôd be comfortable being seen promoting.\n\n# Step-by-Step: How to Get Started\n\n# 1. Understand What UGC Is\n\nSearch¬†**#UGCexample**¬†on X (Twitter) to see real examples.  \nUGC videos are typically ads for Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube where a creator promotes a product in a real, authentic way.\n\n# 2. Build a Simple Portfolio\n\nUse¬†**Canva**¬†(free version).  \nYou don‚Äôt need Canva Pro.  \nCreate a clean, single-page site with your example videos and an¬†*About Me*¬†section.  \nBuy a $20 URL inside Canva so it looks professional.\n\n# 3. Create 4 Example Videos\n\nUse products you already own.  \nFocus on¬†**good lighting**¬†and¬†**clear sound.**  \nPick four different niches to show variety e.g.:\n\n* 1 beauty or skincare\n* 1 pet-related\n* 1 fitness or wellness\n* 1 app or SaaS product\n\nMake each video a¬†*different style:*\n\n* Talking head with b-roll\n* Voiceover + only b-roll\n* Green screen\n* Testimonial/review\n\n# 4. Film an ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù Video\n\nThis goes on your portfolio alongside your written intro and you can also use it on profiles inside UGC specific platform.  \nUse natural light, keep it conversational, and overlay b-roll that represents you.\n\nDon‚Äôt just say ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Roseanne and I create authentic content.‚Äù  \nInstead, make it personal and specific: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Roseanne, a 38-year-old stay-at-home mom from Utah. I love gardening, fitness, and art. After years in the corporate world, I‚Äôm tech-savvy and love testing new apps and tools. My lean on my past experience in XYZ to work with brands, understand their vision and the scope of their needs, and then deliver content that is valuable and meaningful.\n\nBullet points are easier to read and focus on what makes¬†*you*¬†unique: glasses, grey hair, pets, travel, hobbies, etc.\n\n# 5. Start Applying for Gigs\n\nOnce your portfolio and 4 examples are ready, start applying daily.  \nCheck:\n\n* subreddit : ugccreators has a lot of  job listings \n* X (hashtags: #UGCCreatorsNeeded, #UGCOpportunities)\n* UGC platforms:¬†**Billo, JoinBrands, Vidsy, Cohley, Vidovo, Insense, Popfly, Backstage, Upwork**\n\nTreat it like a¬†**numbers game.**  \nIf you apply every day for an hour, you‚Äôll start landing gigs.  \nIf you apply to 2x more, you‚Äôll land 2x more. ( if you apply 1 hour a day and land 1 gig a week, then apply 2 hours a day and youll land 2 gigs a week)  \nOver time, you can add social proof to your portfolio, your examples get better, and reviews snowball into consistent paid work.\n\nI hope this helps and feel free to ask me anything below.  \nI try to respond to every message, even if it takes a bit.",

At your age, the main thing is to start learning how money works and building habits that pay off later. You can try simple things first like reselling items online (thrift flips, sneakers, electronics, etc.), doing gig work like food delivery or dog walking, or offering services such as yard work, cleaning, or tutoring younger students. If you want something more flexible, you can do online tasks  like freelancing basic stuff on Fiverr or Upwork (data entry, writing short descriptions, etc.) or even managing social media pages for small local businesses. The key isn‚Äôt to find the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù skill right away but to start doing something that teaches you responsibility, communication, and consistency. Over time, you‚Äôll naturally pick up skills that you can use to make real money later. Everyone starts somewhere right so  just focus on getting started, not on being great yet.",

Do they all drive really expensive cars? Do they have fancy gardens and lawns? Do they all like to play tennis? etc.\n\nNow go home and look up the things you see those rich people doing. And see what jobs there are that help maintain those rich people things. Some of those jobs have a low barrier to entry. Like waxing fiberglass, it takes a $50 tool, some buffing compound, and strong arms that don't get tired easily. But people with money will pay to have their boat waxed every year because then it's shiny.  Or maybe they want to have their cars professionally detailed in their own driveway? Or maybe they want their leather golf club bag given some leather care and cleaning? Or maybe they'd like to have someone come to their house and use a sonic cleaner for their jewelry? Or have all their stupid-expensive knives sharpened up to 3000 grit? Or wash their walkway, driveway, patio, &amp; brick with a pressure washer?  Or have the numbers for their house repainted?\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nFind what people who have money don't want to do themselves, and offer to do that thing. If you don't have a skill, offer to do a thing that doesn't require a lot of skill, but does require a lot of time and maybe gets dirty. Things rich people don't like dealing with.\n\nStart your own business. As you get better at it, you can raise your price. As you get even better at it, the fact that you take less time means you can do more jobs without lowering your price making you more money. Maybe you can even hire a helper or two.\n\nThis is how my ex's brother went from student to independently wealthy in about 5 years. He just took most of the money he made (in his case lawn care) and spent it on expanding his little business. In the end he had multiple trucks, a whole bunch of lawnmowers, about 15 employees, and he sold the business to his best employee and used it to buy a McMansion for cash.",

You could also print out paper fliers and post them around neighborhood shops (with permission). Make sure a trusted adult knows the addresses you‚Äôre visiting to work. \n\nYou could also try offering babysitting, simple tutoring, or pet sitting services in the same way, but these services may be harder to sell with 0 experience. People will want to know why they should trust you with their kids (a you CPR certified? trustworthy? good with kids? etc) or knowledgable about pets, or that you are tutoring a subject you are good at (did you get straight As in AP Language Arts?) etc. Maybe you have a skill you had not considered before tho? \n\nThe other old fashioned way to get a job. I‚Äôd suggest restaurants if you can swing it, they usually pay unskilled youth the best, because you‚Äôll generally get a share of tip money in addition to minimum wage. Sometimes you can take cash home the same day you work. Any job will do, though! See if you can help out in a field you are interested in possible working in someday. \n\nThe new-fashioned way is online. Sell crafts on Ebay or Etsy, make videos for Tiktok &amp; YT. Write an ebook. There are lots of posts about this, look them up.",

      "selftext": "Okay, after nine actual side hustles, I'm pretty sure my biggest accomplishment is proving I can come up with way more terrible ideas than good ones. Seriously.\n\nI‚Äôve tried everything‚Ä¶. Etsy shops, blogs, print-on-demand, random AI projects, Pinterest loops, even indexing experiments that made my laptop sound like it was about to take off. Most of them died quietly. A few survived. And the stuff that stuck honestly had less to do with talent and more to do with timing.\n\nFirst lesson learned: quit the guessing game. My 'cool' ideas always crashed and burned. But when I simply started paying attention to the data, like trending keywords, those sudden search spikes, and what people were actually buying, things finally picked up. It's unsexy, sure, but it gets the job done.\n\nNext up, I realized loops are king. Forget doing one-off projects; it‚Äôs all about creating these little engines. Like Pinterest traffic sending folks to a blog, or old Medium articles funneling people to Etsy, or even just old listings getting evergreen sales thanks to reviews. The best ones were the ones that just kept going without me having to obsess over them.\n\nLesson three, ditch the 'originality' obsession. I seriously thought I needed to conjure up something nobody had ever seen. Nope. Turns out, just taking a winning concept, giving it your own spin, and getting it out there quickly is a far more profitable game.\n\nThe rest? It‚Äôs mostly noise. Fancy tools, new ‚Äúgrowth hacks,‚Äù even ads, they helped sometimes, but not for long. What actually worked was keeping things small, repeating what clicked, and not getting bored when it got repetitive.\n\nOn paper, none of this sounds particularly impressive. But it's effective, and it just works, silently. And after diving into nine different hustles, I can tell you, 'quietly working' is now infinitely more appealing than the fleeting promise of 'maybe going viral.\n\nAnyone else find that the simple, boring stuff ends up working best?",

I'll sometimes pick up other things for resale too. \n\nIt'll take a little while to learn but you put in the hours and you will get extra money. \n\nYou need a good way to source and you need a good way to sell. \n\nSourcing:\n\nGo to garage sales, thrift stores etc. Search Facebook Marketplace. Set your filters for the last 24 hours, newest first with a 40 or 60 mi radius. Refresh constantly. I built a tool to help with this but I'll put it at the very end though so it doesn't distract from the overall message. You don't necessarily need it. \n\nSelling:\n\nSell locally on Facebook marketplace. This works great for larger items that you don't want to ship but you can sell anything. Create an eBay account. It really is a fantastic way to sell things. You get a lot of eyes. You can sell things there that would take forever to sell locally. \n\n\nLearning:\n\nPut the time in. Watch other YouTube channels that resell. Ready set resell is a good one, I personally think a lot of the YouTubers doing \"$10 game collection\" challenges are interesting. \n\nSome things to focus on: \nLearn how to look at eBay sold listings to know the value of items. Learn how to compare the number of items listed versus the number of items sold to know sell through rate. Make sure you're not scammed. It takes a while to learn the common scams. Learn about inventory management. Learn about shipping. \n\nOnce you have some experience sourcing on Facebook Marketplace you'll figure out that when you search for a particular keyword you'll get stale listings. You have to constantly search to find the new stuff because it's gone quickly. If you search YouTube for \"Better Marketplace Pro\" I have a demo video of the Chrome extension I wrote to help with sourcing on Facebook Marketplace.",

Here are 7 you can start from anywhere with minimal upfront cost:\n\n- Product Tester: Test new startup products, share feedback, and build repeat clients.\n\n- Canva Designer: Create digital designs, posters, and zines that focus on emotion, not just logos.\n\n- Research Writer: Produce niche content on topics like minimalism, storytelling, urban gardening, or even pasta recipes.\n\n- Ghostwriter: Write letters, fan fiction, or memoirs for people who don't have the time.\n\n- Accountability Buddy: Check in with folks, listen, and help them stay consistent.\n\n- Voice-over Artist: Turn ebooks or scripts into audio. Do voice over for ads, podcasts, etc.\n\n- Private Community Builder: Set up a Discord server or a group with a vibe and people can pay to be part of.\n\nAll of these take time and honesty, but they can grow into real side income.",

My brother taught me a bit of python, I felt smart, I thought rent would sort itself out. It didn‚Äôt, it didn‚Äôt at all. I spun up WordPress, let chatgpt and Gemini grind around 500 posts, added meta tags and whatnot, watched the analytics like a hawk, refreshed again, refreshed again also. Ad revenue after half a year was $28.35, which might buy me a lunch.\n\nI tried AI faceless videos too. Stock voices, avatars, tool recs. One clip hit 48 views, most did 30 or less, and I was down \\~280 for subs. A comment said it felt like an ad made by an AI for another AI, which is kinda fair and also also painful.\n\nI even pushed AI stock photos. Hundreds uploaded, ten downloads, $6.3 usd. The only thing that actually gave me money back was price drop monkey, clawed about $148.5 in gift cards from pirce drops. Not income, but defintely real cash back, unlike teh promise of passive anything.\n\nIf someone here cracked it without ads or an audience, I‚Äôm listening.",

Times are tough, and nothing is ever free. No one is just giving away money, it will always take a combination of work and luck. Anyone saying anything else is just running their own grift trying to sell you courses or a how-to book or something.",

That's where the magic happens, this is like nicotine, you will always upload at the same time, giving the followers a routine, in the end it can only \"snowball\". \n\nto summarize :  \n\\- Study your audience before\n\n\\- Find the best niche for your audience\n\n\\- Built first WITHOUT EXPECTING ANY RETURNS\n\n\\- Your punctuality will make your community grow\n\n\\- Make longer videos once you have regular viewers who already like your content\n\nYou will eventually have videos who wont pop off but that's part of the game, your on your own, you try things, you don't need ads, you just need to work your audience.\n\nIn two weeks I gained 1Million views across 28videos + 4K followers and 83K likes, ALL WITHOUT ADS !",

          "body": "Agreed. My favorite is the predictable upsells. Buy my ebook for 7 dollars, then here's 5 more upsells, inevitably being a 100-300 full course, and then coaching for 5000 or more. \n\nIt is called digital marketing for a reason. That's what they are making money off of, even if they are or are not doing the thing they are selling. \n\nBut its also a double edged sword. Ecom is a common topic in this space. Nobody can deny that people buy things online. And yes, it is possible to start doing it. But a 7 dollar ebook, 300 dollar course, etc is not going to flip a switch and turn on the money machine. It is a business, and far from \"passive\". And the real dirty secret is that any business will require a good chunk of capital to start. \n\nHere's a few pointers ive found helps:\n\n1. If youre seeing an ad for a course on socials, that space is already flooded and will be tough to compete in unless you have a really good plan on how to differentiate. \n2. If you dont have at least a few thousand dollars base to get everything setup and marketing up and running, prob not gonna happen, and it will be another wasted attempt.\n3. Any course you are seeing an ad for that is multiple hundreds of dollars, that information can usually be found for free, or much cheaper on sites like Udemy. Any time im tempted to purchase a course like that, I go and check udemy, and can usually find something similar or better for 50 dollars or less. \n4. Your time is precious, and the most valuable resource you have. Don't under value it. Most of these things listed as \"passive\" income simply aren't. They will require alot of your time, and they will require money to get up and running. And as with any business, its never guaranteed. Using ecom as the example, you could spend dozens or hundreds of hours, and thousands of dollars to launch a store/product/brand etc, all to see it not take off. Then that time and money is gone. \n\nFinally, the only real \"passive\" income is investing. Park your money in assets, and watch it grow. I have spent thousands on courses, alot of which has to do with the fact that I like learning, and dont mind spending 50 bucks to see what dream someone is selling. But looking back, if I would have just parked all that money over the years into something as lame as boring old index funds, id have some serious returns by now.",

Do you have any hobby interests that translate, maybe think outside the box?\n\nThese are all skills I developed at seperate points in my life, but really dedicated the initial time to learn, leaving me huge variety now, flexibility, and fun!  $$ amounts are Canadian\n\n- I teach guitar/piano ($80/hour, currently 30 hours a week from home, because I am really enjoying it, but sometimes I slim it to 15-20 hours if my other interests are higher. $60,000-$100,000/yr\n\n- I teach people how to fly model planes and racing drones($50/hour ish), and teach groups of kids how to build and launch rockets. Very casual, i do this in the dry months, probably just a couple times a week. Most parents are lazy, and won‚Äôt help their kids/youth with these specific hobbies, or think they are going to be expensive (they are not ).  So plenty of room for private instruction. \n\n- Book Keeping for small businesses. Not much skill required. It is not mathy and accounting. It is book keeping.  Don‚Äôt need any license or schooling. Just take some free courses online and find a mentor. Flat rate per month.  Probably $60k/year for 10 hours a week of whenever-I-want work at the coffee shop. \n\n- I enjoy working with wood. I have a full garage of wood working tools and machines, all paid for exclusively by making wooden towel ladders, and wood wall hexagons to sell to moms/wives on Facebook.   Towel ladders cost about $10 to make, and about 40 minutes to make 4 or 5 of them. I sell for $40-60 depending on details\n\n- I love flipping and trying music gear on marketplace. I rarely buy anything and then sell it for less.  I recycle the money into more gear. Guitars, PA Systems, FX pedals, etc.\n\n- I make video courses and sell on Udemy.  I have a course on how to solve the basic Rubik‚Äôs cube for a complete beginner.  It took me 4 hours to completely create and upload the course including design and film and edit.    It has made $500 total so far in about 6 months. But that‚Äôs a good hourly rate for the work.  I have other similar courses that do better, but that‚Äôs a good example of just thinking outside the box. \n\nOverall, private instruction is just a great living if you are confident in your skill. There are millions of people who only learn well with face to face human contact, and not online videos.    Teach/Instruct anything. \n\nI do have a degree in music, but it‚Äôs in a box in the basement since I got it and no one has ever asked to see it.  I‚Äôve made more money from hobby endeavours, than when I taught in school/college level. \n\nIt‚Äôs the literal ‚Äòfollow your dreams‚Äô approach. \n\nGood luck, message me anytime.",

And while I was grateful to have a good-paying job, the work environment was terrible. I had a borderline abusive boss, high-stress, high pressure, and I felt like I had no option but to stick with it until retirement (at least age 60). I couldn't afford to quit. I had a family to look after (married, 3 kids) and we were a single income family. \n\nThankfully, that wasn't the end of my story. \n\nAt age 42, I hit my breaking point, and decided that I was going to do whatever it takes to create another path. Not just go to a different company, but build a business that aligned with the lifestyle my wife and I dreamed of. For us, that was self-employment - a fully remote business that would give us full control over our time and allow us to work from anywhere. \n\nWith no entrepreneurial background and very few skills in online business, etc. I taught myself how to build a basic website, and I started a personal finance blog. I must have watched a couple hundred hours of YouTUbe tutorials to figure it out. That led to a freelancing side hustle, which became a full-time business and replaced my $120k/year bank manager job. \n\nI walked away from the 9-5 in 2022. \n\nToday, I own 2 profitable businesses, both from my laptop. My wife is at home with me and helps me with parts of both businesses. \n\nTwo of our kids are out of the house now, our youngest (19) is still at home. But we have so much time for our kids, our schedules are such that we can help them with various things when needed. For example, we dog-sat for our son and his wife this week while they were out of town. I just worked from their place. Next month, we're flying to Vancouver to see our daughter off as she leaves for Hawaii for six months. \n\nThen, we'll be heading south later in the winter to escape the cold in Canada. \n\nIf you had asked me if any of this was possible in my early 40s, I would have said you are crazy. But I just started on that path, took control over my future, and it completely changed the trajectory of my life. \n\nIf you have more specific questions, let me know. I'd be happy to share any wisdom I have.",

It paid decently though, especially nuclear shit.\nI also lived abroad and travelled a lot, which made me a different thinking person compared to the average people in my place, quite out of the box and definitely not a good rat for the race.\n\nI eventually started doing ecomm, later opened an ecomm company with my wife that did pretty well for several years but things turned bad and we went out of business, with all the problems you can imagine, debts, wrecked psychological and mental health.\nHad to start a job from way below zero at 38, with 2 kids, a low paying one because, you know, it's all about degrees.\nI just turned 40 a few months ago, and comparing my life, my situation with other people my age or even younger is really depressing, since I lost almost everything and still have debts.\nAnd I am on the way to find THE path, my situation may sound desperate to me at nighttime, when I can't sleep, but this life gave me a strong resilience capacity and the power to keep hope.\n\nI know it will be damn hard, will have to start again from scratch, but trust me, this is not as rough as you may think, if you find some pleasure in it or have an attainable financial goal, the path will be enjoyable.

Because of that, I won‚Äôt describe or dig too deep into what I do exactly, but I would advise you to start investing in ETFs or any stocks that you trust on a long term basis. Hope you do well",

When you're younger it's easier to take \"leaps of faith\" but the older you get naturally the more risk averse you kind of get? Especially if you have dependents.

          "body": "It's super simple.\n\nYou have to have something of value to trade for the money. Money is a placeholder for, and a way to measure, the relative value of something.\n\nYour goal for employment is to find the highest and best use of your time. For example...you might be qualified for the following jobs:\n\n$10/hour Fast Food Cashier\n\n$15/hour CostCo employee\n\n$25/hour Bank of America Teller\n\n$50/hour Plumber/Electrician\n\nIn each of those scenarios, you're giving up an hour of your time, but the value that you get is very different across those roles.\n\nIf you're only qualified for the first 2 jobs, then your goal is to figure out what training/education you need to upgrade your options.\n\nA bigger problem right now is that for quite a while now there4 have been more people graduating college than are needed for jobs that require a college degree. Since there are so many more people with college degrees out there than there are jobs that need college degrees, it means that people without college degrees are competing against people with college degrees for jobs that don't require college degrees. And since those people with college degrees largely have student loans and HAVE to work or else they will default on those loans, employers can get away with hiring college grads for cheap in jobs where someone doesn't really need a degree...and that relegates people who just have HS degrees and no other training to basic service jobs. And if you don't have a HS diploma/GED, fahgeddaboudit.\n\nSo if you find yourself struggling to make money, you need to do a real inventory of your skills, spend some time researching what various jobs pay (including any benefits, which have real value by the way) and see where there's overlap\n\nIncome generally doesn't just happen...you are far more likely to get the income you want if you make a plan for how to get there and then take steps down that path. It may take a while, but it'll probably happen because most other people don't make that plan.\n\nGood luck to you!\n\nedit:\n\nFor me, I grew up poor, but did very well in school. Prior to meeting my wife, I almost always have 2-4 roommates and was able to live cheaply and/or save because splitting bills 3+ ways generally is a good strategy for keeping living expenses low.\n\nI eventually got a master's degree from a well-regarded school, and started a business. I struggled to make money in that business for a decade. After 10 years, I decided to change directions and switch industries. During that time, I'd met and gotten to know a lot of people. One of them had several businesses and recognized that I was talented and referred me to a company that he knew was hiring. I started at a salary that was less than I was worth ($72k), and earned meaningful raises. I distinguished myself (provided a lot more value than he was paying for) while there and learned a new industry. I worked there for 10 years until I was making about $275k per year. At that point, I was still underpaid and for that and other reasons I quit. I now work for myself making comparable money in the same industry, and have a flexible schedule that allows me to spend more time with my family.",

I've been doing this for around 2 years now and if anyone has any questions I can fill in what I know. There are sites that will give you a small bonus just for checking in once a day. These small bonuses usually are under a dollar or are exactly a dollar, which isn't alot. But there are 70+ of these sites available and I use all 70+ of them everyday to get my check in. That makes me around $1050 a month which is $35 a day, then multiply that by an average of 30 days in a month. Since I'm a nerd with all of this I made a spreadsheet that has all of their information on it if you want to check it out.

          "body": "What I respect in this post is the effort and breadth of attempts.\n\nIn a similar fashion, I‚Äôll give my results.\n\nI had a poker website that generated at its peak $1200/month, largely from referral bonuses from people who would sign up for an account at a poker site through my referral link.\n\nI had a bunch of websites that I bought for business ideas I‚Äôve had, and have sold a couple of those for  couple thousand each (after someone reached out to me and I negotiated the price).\n\nI rented some authorized user slots on a credit card I had and made $6300 over 14 months.\n\nRelated to that, I have a ton of cash back rewards cards that I use. I consider passive savings to be the same as passive income ( or better since it‚Äôs not subject to income taxes). I earn about $3000 per year in cash back on credit card spend by using the ‚Äúright‚Äù card for most of my purchases.\n\nI started a lending business that required some up front work in underwriting clients, and about 30 minutes of ongoing work each week (so technically not totally passive) that made about $30k the first year, and was up to $100k by the 4th year. It‚Äôs year 7 now and the income is back down to around $65k a year.\n\nI used to post articles on eHow that would generate $30-$40 per month collectively.\n\nI‚Äôve subscribed to a site that lists class action lawsuit settlements, and when I see one I qualify for I join the settlement. Classaction.org\n\nI‚Äôve checked my name on the abandoned property websites maintained by the states I‚Äôve lived in and found some lost monies I was owed.\n\nI‚Äôve done medical research studies (in college) that paid a few thousand. Not totally passive, but not exactly work either.\n\nOnce upon a time there was a service called Earny‚Ä¶you‚Äôd sign up and give access to your email account and it would track online purchases made at retailers that offered a price match if the price you paid for something dropped within X days of your purchase. Sometimes that price protection was offered by a store, but it was also a feature of some of the premium credit cards. After signing up, I‚Äôd literally just get checks on the mail to deposit. I don‚Äôt believe that service still exists.\n\nI knew someone who worked at a coin collector who would pay a premium for certain collectible sets that would go on sale at a mint. As an example a set might cost $3200 from the mint (available in limited quantities), his company would offer $100-$200 above that, and I‚Äôd buy it in my credit card (getting $30 worth of cashback in addition to the cost plus premium paid back to me by his company). A bunch of us would do that‚Ä¶apparently the coin collector was looking for pieces that were ‚Äúperfect‚Äù quality in those sets that would fetch a far higher premium and he was still able to unload the new sets we ordered for a profit no matter what. That was like 20 years ago.\n\nI‚Äôm sure there have been other things over the years. I haven‚Äôt done any video content creation, digital agency work, or guides/eBooks. Never tried dropshipping either.",

I‚Äôve been testing similar things and found that small digital products can be surprisingly reliable once set up. I packaged a few templates using [Nas.io](http://Nas.io), which is an AI business platform that helps you find customers online and automate most of the work.  \n  \nIt‚Äôs not massive, but it‚Äôs a consistent side hustle from home that earns a bit of passive income every month without any daily effort. Sometimes slow and steady really does win.",

Can withdraw any time you like during the last 2 weeks of any month (so like right now it‚Äôs up- prob just so they don‚Äôt have a million txs going all over) takes like a week to get into your wallet (again prob for less txs) \n\nThey recently made it KYC tho. So less enticing than it used to be \n\nYou can gamble on it and earn from ads etc. but it‚Äôs 6 satoshis an hour for each person you‚Äôve referred, up to 100 maximum (so after 20 people, it‚Äôs not any more beneficial- but you‚Äôre putting people on so I feel like I‚Äôm just being nice when I do it lol) \n\nIdk if I can post links in here though? I have all my friends and family on it, and 2400 satoshis a day is a lot‚Ä¶ takes some time to get to that, and a lot of people give up (each person you refer will have to do the button each day to add that +5, or it‚Äôs only +1, which you don‚Äôt have to do anything for)\n\nIn return though, could you tell me about some of these other apps? lol",

      "selftext": "Okay so... I know everyone's sick of \"I built a niche site\" posts but hear me out 'cause I almost gave up like 47 times lol. Started a niche blog in pet supplies (specialized gear for a particular pet type). Figured it'd be easy - write reviews, slap affiliate links, profit, right? Yeah... no.\n\nMonths 1-4: The delulu phase  \nWriting 2-3 articles per week. Checking Google Analytics every 5 minutes.  \nTraffic? Maybe 10 visitors/day, half were probably me refreshing üíÄ  \nRevenue? $23 over 4 months. I made more finding a $20 bill on the street lmao.  \nMonths 5-8: The reality check\n\nStarted actually learning SEO instead of hoping Google would magically find me. Turns out you can't just write and expect to rank. Who knew? (Everyone except me apparently)\n\nMonths 9-11: The pivot\n\nStopped trying to be an SEO expert and outsourced the heavy lifting 'cause spending 15+ hours/week on outreach to get ghosted by 97/100 people wasn't it.\n\nCurrent stats (Month 14): Traffic: \\~400 visitors/day. Revenue: $800-900/month. Time investment: 5-6 hours/week. Total articles: 67.\n\nWhat moved the needle:\n\n1. Long-tail keywords (not \"best dog food\" but \"best grain-free food for senior dogs with allergies\")\n2. Actual link building from relevant sites\n3. Product roundups convert way better\n4. Patience (nothing happened for almost a year)\n\nThe weird part? Articles from 8 months ago are making money now. You do the work today, maybe it pays off in 6-9 months. Or doesn't lol.\n\nMy advice: Don't expect fast results. Add 6 months to whatever timeline you're thinking. Learn basics, delegate the rest. Long-tail keywords are your friend. Track everything.\n\nAnyone else grinding on niche sites? I feel like everyone either gives up in month 3 or becomes a millionaire and I'm just out here in the middle lmao",

The key is to focus on one or two income streams, master them, and automate as much as possible before adding anything else.\n\nI started in print on demand 4 years ago and have been succesful in this. I consistently make 10-20 sales per week with POD. I started digital marketing in April of this year, and after a lot of tweaks, I have been seeing sales in this area also.

          "body": "This is actually the right mindset to have. Passive income isn‚Äôt about getting rich overnight, it‚Äôs about building something once and letting it keep working for you over time. One of the most approachable places to start is digital products. You can create planners, templates, or ebooks using beginner-friendly tools and list them on platforms like Gumroad or Etsy. Once they‚Äôre uploaded, they can generate income without requiring constant active work.\n\nPrint-on-demand is another great option if you want something scalable without having to handle inventory. You design products like T-shirts, hoodies, or mugs, and the platform takes care of the printing and shipping. It‚Äôs simple to start and can run in the background once your store is up.\n\nAffiliate marketing is a strong choice if you‚Äôre interested in recommending products. You share links, and when someone makes a purchase through your link, you earn a commission. When paired with content like a blog, newsletter, or social media, this can turn into a reliable income stream.\n\nStarting a YouTube channel is one of the most powerful ways to build something long-term. You don‚Äôt have to be on camera if you‚Äôre not comfortable with it, and there are tools that make voiceovers and editing simple. Once your channel gains traction, it can bring in income through ads, affiliate links, sponsorships, and even your own products.\n\nYou could also explore freelancing or offering digital services as a way to build initial capital while working on more passive streams. And for a long-term foundation, investing in things like index funds or dividend-paying stocks can be a smart move to grow your income steadily.\n\nThe key is to pick one lane to start, build momentum, and layer in other streams over time. That‚Äôs how people create real freedom without needing to hustle endlessly.\n\nI cover all the strategies to build an online income business in my newsletter. Visit my newsletter, link in my bio.",

There are so many options out there, from freelancing and social media management to digital marketing, e-commerce, and content creation, and I want to take the time to figure out which one fits me best. I like the idea of being able to work from anywhere and build something of my own while gaining experience that could open up new opportunities down the road.

Traffic and trust come from posting valuable content regularly, whatever valuable means to your customer, financial or emotional. Storytelling helps you explain the benefits to the customer, meaning what benefit they might receive, based on past stories and testimonials. Typically what they receive is a personal transformation, a new self. Sales is a matter of testing, using authoritative framing and tone, and relating to the customer, to find out why they as an individual need this. Trust is important in sales, but that's already built up with content in the traffic funnel. Once they trust you and they're interested in the product, it's then a matter of getting them to convince themselves they need it, without being desperate or pushy.",

      "selftext": "Hi r/passive_income,\n\nI've been a long-time lurker and wanted to finally contribute by sharing my journey of building a niche blog from $0 to \\~$500/mo in passive income over the last 12 months. My goal is to be 100% transparent about the work, the costs, and the mistakes.\n\n**The Niche:** I chose niche \"vintage camera repair\"\\] because I had a personal interest in it, but I also saw low-competition keywords.\n\n**The Strategy (The \"Passive\" Part):** The income is \"passive\" now, but it took a year of very active, upfront work.\n\n1. **Content:** Wrote 50 high-quality, SEO-optimized articles (avg. 1,500 words).\n2. **Monetization:** Started with display ads (Ezoic/Mediavine) once I hit traffic thresholds.\n3. **Affiliate Links:** Added affiliate links for \\[Products related to the niche, e.g., \"camera parts, specific tools\"\\].\n\n**The Numbers (Approx.):**\n\n* **Month 1-6:** $0 - $20/mo (The \"Google Sandbox\" is real)\n* **Month 7-9:** $100/mo (Traffic started picking up)\n* **Month 10-12:** $300 - $500/mo (Hit ad threshold, articles ranking)\n\n**Total Upfront Cost:**\n\n* Domain: $10\n* Hosting: $120 (for the year)\n* SEO Tool (optional): $99/mo (I used it for 3 months)\n* **Total:** \\~$430\n\n**My Biggest Mistake:** Wasting the first 3 months writing about topics *I* thought were interesting instead of what people were *actually* searching for. Keyword research is everything.\n\n**What's Next:** I now spend about 2-3 hours a month just updating plugins and maybe adding one new article. It's not \"set it and forget it,\" but it's highly leveraged.\n\nI hope this breakdown is helpful for anyone starting out.\n\n**What's the biggest \"mistake\" you made early in your passive income journey that you wish you could go back and fix?**",

My passive income project had its \"best day ever\" with a $400 sale, which turned out to be a fraud attack.\n\nI almost got hit with hundreds in chargeback fees ($15 per transaction!) on top of the lost sale.\n\nThe scary part? This happened because Stripe's most important fraud-prevention settings are OFF by default.\n\nHere's the 3-minute fix to protect yourself:\n\n* Go to your Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Radar ‚Üí Rules.\n* Find and ENABLE the rules to BLOCK payments if:\n   1. CVC verification fails\n   2. Postal code verification fails\n* For ultimate protection, enable 3D Secure (3DS) in your payment settings. This shifts fraud liability from you to the bank, so you're covered.\n\nI caught it in time, but it was a massive wake-up call. Don't learn this lesson the expensive way.\n\nI wrote a full post-mortem on what happened, the exact fraud pattern to look for, and a step-by-step guide with screenshots on my blog.\n\nFull Story &amp; Guide:¬†[https://choy.in/blog/stripe-is-dangerous](https://choy.in/blog/stripe-is-dangerous)\n\nHope this helps someone avoid a disaster!",

That's *active* emotional and financial work.\n* **Real Estate?** You have to find the deal, secure financing, fix toilets (or manage the property manager who does).\n* **Niche Site?** You have to build it, write content, do SEO, and maintain it.\n* **SaaS/App?** You have to code it, market it, and handle customer support.\n\nWhat we're all chasing is **Leveraged Income**: The ability to de-link our time from our earnings. You do the work *once*, and it continues to pay you 10, 100, or 1000 times over. A blog post you write today can earn ad revenue for 5 years.\n\nCalling it \"passive\" implies no work. Calling it \"leveraged\" respects the (often massive) upfront effort.\n\nChanging my mindset from \"passive\" to \"leveraged\" helped me focus on building *systems and assets*, not just looking for a magic money button.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way?

Anyone can help and share when do they pay OneForma? As at the moment, it shows $0 for this month.\n\n2. When the money is in OneForma, do they automatically transfer it to Payoneer or do I need to request it from OneForma's platform?\n\nThank you.",

I've tried affiliate marketing, CPA marketing, dropshipping, e-com, SMMA, lead generation / client acquisition agencies... you name it. Some of them failed, some of them did alright, some of them did quite well.\n\nFast forward to today: I've been doing KDP for over a year now, 14 months to be precise and in that time I went from living in my car to having a full blown business with 4 full time employees.\n\nFor anyone unfamiliar Amazon KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing) is Amazon's self publishing platform where you can sell paperbacks, hard cover books, ebooks, and even audio books (through ACX). It doesn't require any upfront investment.  \nIs there a learning curve? Yes.  \nIs it worth it? ABSOLUTELY.\n\nAnd in my opinion this is one of the best and easiest online business models right now, especially for beginners, because:\n\n* You don't need to be a writer\n* You don't need a big budget\n* You can work from anywhere\n* You get access to Amazon's traffic (instead of paying for ads)\n* The books that you made continue to sell almost passively\n\nKDP isn't a \"get rich quick\" scheme, but if you're willing to learn, experiment and stay consistent, it can genuinely change your life, just like it did mine. A year ago I had nothing, today I own a real business that is still growing.\n\nI hope you guys give it a try and have success with it! YOU CAN DO IT!",

I basically travelled to one place and then ended up back where I started after a couple of months. My issue was that whenever you travel somewhere you are at a metaphorically blank page. If you like that good for you. For me I'm open to meet new people but it's an effort in a city where you never set foot before.\n\nOnce around 3-5 years ago I met a founder called Jan. He had what I would call the solution to this problem which never really left me but I never decided to act on it until today.\n\nHe was living in shared flat somewhere in Berlin with 3-4 other builders in a apartment which had a big living room, workstations setup and was just living the builders life but not in isolation but rather with other like-minded people.\n\nNow I had that every now and then but usually I work from home, sometimes in a co working space but none of these environments are very socially Inducive. As entrepreneur/builder or whatever you wanna call yourself you already commit to a life where you spent most of your time working alone on your idea/agency/projects.\n\nI want to replicate what I experienced a couple of years ago. I created a \"manifesto\" where I describe that experience and my ask is simple: I'm looking for 1-2 entrepreneurs who are open to join this experiment. If you see yourself in this document then hit me up with the contact details seen in the link.\n\nP.S Seems like I can't drop a link here. DM me and I can send you the document.",

But one of the employees, Ram Shriram, ended up intro‚Äôing Bezos to Larry Page and Sergey Brin. They show him a prototype, and he wrote a $250k check on the spot into their $1M seed round.\n\nFast forward to Google‚Äôs IPO in 2004, that $250k was worth $280M. If he had held on to it, that would have been $20B today (I heard that on the Acquired podcast).\n\nPretty much the reality of investing in startups.

A rule of thumb is to target 7.5% growth: 4% to live on; 3.5% as a healthy hedge against inflation.

I started flipping early too and have chased lots of online hustles, some that grew fast and some that crashed when a platform banned me. I relate to the learning curve you describe, and your approach of testing, tracking, and leaning into what sells is exactly how you scale. Your curiosity and late night research are real strengths.\n\nThree practical moves I would use next: create a simple profit tracker that records buy price, fees, shipping, and net margin so you know which SKUs to scale. Pick two niches to specialize in and standardize your listings and photos so you reduce time per sale and improve conversion. Build supplier relationships and start sourcing in bulk through liquidation or wholesale when a product proves itself to increase margins. Automate and document by making one listing template, one shipping SOP, and a restock routine so you stop reinventing the wheel. Finally, protect yourself by diversifying sales channels and saving a portion of profits to test expansion. I coach entrepreneurs and my own history of bouncing between hustles taught me that systems and focus beat random chasing, so your steady $3k a month is a great foundation. If you want, I can help sketch a one page tracker or a tight listing template to speed up scaling. Keep testing, stay curious, and small consistent systems will keep this growing.\n\nAustin Erkl - Entrepreneur Coach",

So many of our clients here can attest to that.\n\nBut late night anxiety over your overdraft, is just giving you an insomnia habit you didnt ask for. Worrying is like a rocking horse - it gets you nowhere. So have a good nights sleep and leave work until the morning hours. The best businesses work smarter not harder. Time,money and mind freedom - thats the balance that makes a business not just survive but thrive.  \nGet that right - and confidence spreads through everything you do - your team, your clients, even your own headspace. Business is hard, but it doesnt have to be soul crushing - and it definitely can be fun when you do it right.",

It felt like a loss at the time but that imbalance of power never leads to good business. With hindsight, I'd probably try to introduce premiums for specific bad behaviour (e.g. last minute request fee) and stick to them religiously. Then if the customer leaves, they leave. If they stay they'll be incentivised to behave better, and who knows, maybe they will (if not you can keep increasing those premiums). I think the scenario where they accept the blanket price increase but continue behaving badly doesn't do enough to fix the issue - they'll still make your life hell.",

          "body": "I used to run a marketing agency for 4 years, had the same experience with my 2nd ever client I signed. They were simultaneously the best and worst thing to ever happen to me. They became a huge case study that enabled me to sign probably 10+ more brands as a result of the video case study and testimonial. They had something like a 12x roi with our services (search engine optimization). \n\nThey were hell to work with. I only kept them on because the numbers just kept going up, but no matter how good results were, they acted terribly. I told them we were raising prices by $1k, they wanted like 3 meetings to see if it aligned with their goals (remember the 12x roi lol). Finally they agreed, then made my life astronomically worse. Finally they made a cross comment to one of my employees, i fired them on the spot. \n\nWas seeing red for like 30 minutes (uncommon for me), then later that night I went on a first date and met my girlfriend (now wife). One of the wildest days of my life, I wish I'd have fired them months earlier. I went on to have a few more clients that were bad (they were the worst by far), and I had to fire several of them for poor behavior, and i always remember sleeping like a baby the next night. it's like my body knew how much stress had been eliminated that day",

If you are billing them a set fee per month the scope should detail what that fee includes. It should include the amount of time allocated for that fee and a standard for communication. EG: standing conversation at X time for 1hour, when support is expected, how it is to be delivered etc. You should lay everything out so that when they go outside the scope it is clear and you can then address the scope issue. It has been very rare that we have come across a client that finds this unreasonable. No one gives full access. It is not wise to make emotional decisions or to go at a client with blame. Just be professional; the vast majority of humans will react in a professional manner. Good communication and quick feedback is the key. Best of luck to you.",

Could your expenses really survive a 50% cut in revenue? I had this problem. The customer was extremely difficult to deal with. Eventually, I couldn‚Äôt keep up with their demands and they fired me. At the worst time possible. Which basically tanked my business so you are good to get ahead of it early. Looking back I should have tried to put my business consultant hat on and worked with them on how to streamline our processes. I should have improved our communication and try to anticipate their needs. In my case it wasn‚Äôt just 5K, it was over $350,000 a year. But hindsight is 2020 and I think I was arrogant thinking that I could just make them conform to my business. \n\nSounds like you already sent the new invoice but if it was me, I would schedule a meeting with them and say hey all of this extra work is costing me an extra $2500 a month. I want to meet with you to structure a new way so that I can get your invoice back down to 5K a month. I really want to work with you to make this a successful business relationship.",

Work with clients who align with our way of working or they dont work with us at all. \n\nHaving the confidence to lay those boundaries as a business owner free's us up to seek out clients that are worth our time.

Some clients will always drag their feet leading to a scramble at the end of the month and penalties for late filing. We put in a surcharge system for clients who did not meet our internal deadlines leading to better processes and stress come January. Its worked and we have decided to implement elsewhere - weeding out the clients who didnt fall into line with our way of working. It hasnt impacted revenue and we have in fact picked up more clients who are happy to know our structure and boundaries.\n\nPut a plan into place so that you dont just have a good chunk of revenue coming from  one client - line up some time to market and pick up a few extra, less stressful clients that can equate to the revenue stream you get from this one client\n\notherwise - Go for it",

      "selftext": "# \"Comfort is the worst addiction\" - Marcus Aurelius\n\nI think some of you might relate to this, some of you might learn from my mistakes.\n\nSince I was 15-16 years old I did every business model you can think of: forex, stock trading, affiliate marketing, SEO blogs, dropshipping, customer acquisition/lead generation agency, CPA marketing, SMMA, POD, Amazon FBA, Amazon Merch, Amazon KDP... you name it. I wasn't afraid of work, I wasn't afraid of risk, I was disciplined.\n\nBut in 2020 everything collapsed around me.\n\n* My Amazon KDP account got banned (how I was earning money at that time)\n* I broke up with my girlfriend\n* One of my closest friends and my accountability partner passed away\n\nI still had around $150k saved up, so financially I was comfortable, that's where my life really fell apart.\n\nI though I'll have a few months off to reset, but that turned into five years of comfort, depression, procrastination and avoidance. Having no pressure and no accountability I sliped into all the easiest escaped of all, video games, distractions, mindless media, short dopamine hits, ZERO DISCIPLINE. I told myself \"I would start again tomorrow\", \"...next week\", ...next month\"...\n\nComfort was my drug. The worst part is that it didn't feel harmful at the time, but it was killing my ambition.\n\nThen life hit me again. In early 2024, a series of unexpected expenses wiped me down to \\~$15k and shortly after, I got hit with a fine from an old dropshippping project where my business partner screwed me over. I went from comfortable... to broke... to in debt.\n\nBut that pain made me wake up. It brought back the hunger that comfort had stolen from me.\n\nI returned to Amazon KDP with purpose and I managed to build a decent business and because of it I am going to pay off my debt by the end of this year.\n\nI'm sharing this because some of you are in the exact danger zone that I lived in. Enough comfort to survive, not enough pain to change, slowly dying inside while calling it \"rest\", \"balance\" or \"taking time\".  \nComfort isn't rest, it is a cage with pillows.\n\nSo if you're building your business now, procrastinating your next project or thinking about quitting.¬†**LEAN INTO THE DISCOMFORT**. That is where all the progress lives.\n\nI wasted 5 years of my life learning this the hard way. I just hope that even one person who reads this, avoids the same trap that got me.",

I feel like a lot of people give it a lot of different names But the one I've liked the most is. **thinking on a long time horizon** or \"***What will the actions I've done today get me, multiplied by two years? Where will i be? What will i have?\"*** It helps you realize that all you really are is a series of inputs and actions. I'm not saying you can't enjoy video games, Or even enjoy a TV show and so on. But it's the level of severity that matters, Playing an hour of a video game after a long stay of work can feel fantastic. We're playing 6 to 8 hours for eight days in a row? Where will that get you in two years? But if you look at your life as merely actions that will eventually amount to something, it can make things clear On what you'll need to do to increase the percentage chance you'll succeed or have the life you want. and when you think about it like that, **the game of life becomes clear**. In order to play the game you need to ***flip the coin as many times as possible***, Knowing full well you'll fail. The second thing you'll need is an ***understanding of how to flip the coin In a better way***, The aggregation of skills. The last thing you'll need ***is a long enough time horizon*** Where all your effort compounds and you can win a majority of the time.   \n\\~Alas, it's easier said than done.

I wrote all the code myself and know it really well.   I'm totally maxxed out but I'm doing it without debt or investors and the biggest organization in the niche is interested.  I had a part time contract employee this year to test the waters and he was absolutely brilliant but also has seasonal affective disorder and ODD and was hard to manage and he can't work between November and April his brain and motivation just collapse as the light goes so it's back to me...   Main issue at the mo' is I'm in California and want to hop back over to border to Oregon before scaling due to just a bit easier regulatory environment but would have to sell my house to do that to create a new domicile so just being in the discomfort of small town isolation while I build more base...

      "selftext": "We‚Äôve been working with this guy for months. Solid communication, clean delivery, zero drama. The kind of agency you barely even manage because stuff just gets done.\n\nThen last week on a random call he drops something wild. He says he wants to be straight with us. Turns out the original case study he sent in his pitch wasn‚Äôt real. The results, screenshots, even the dashboard video were made using a mock tool that copies real platform dashboards.\n\nHe said no one gave him a shot without proof so he faked it to get in the door. Then actually learned the skills for real after landing us. And honestly, he‚Äôs been better than most of the so-called verified experts we‚Äôve paid before.\n\nHe showed us the site and honestly we couldn‚Äôt even tell the difference between the fake dashboard and a real one. Which is a bit scary if you think about it.\n\nIt‚Äôs weird realizing the thing that made us hire him was fake, but the outcome actually justified it. Would you trust someone after a confession like that?",

I‚Äôd also request to know immediately what else is faked because you cannot afford the ramifications from any other fake work unless you know about it and can start containing or mitigating the impact. Depending on what you find, there could be a risk of customer loss or worse litigation.\n\nOnce that is out of the way, you should decide if you want to let them work towards rebuilding trust. IMO it must NOT be a simple just trust them but rather they‚Äôd need to agree to not represent artificial data as real and work under additional scrutiny into their output which you can slowly reduce as trust is rebuilt. This is not just for the benefit of knowing if they are trustworthy but also to really drive home the point on how sacred trust is.",

          "body": "Yeah we actually get better results with email and LinkedIn than we do with calling, I assume because it‚Äôs easier to ignore an email or LinkedIn message than tell a good cold caller to fuck off. 300 isn‚Äôt a ton of emails, and getting one or two good replies off that seems reasonable. The thing is that when you use list building tools and a good deliverability setup you can easily send thousands of emails per month and convert anywhere from 0.5%-5% to warm leads depending on how targeted and exciting your offer is. Say 10% of the warm leads buy, you back into needing to send 1,000 emails and talk to 10 people to close a deal. Call that $500 in tech costs and a day of work to net a deal. If you‚Äôre shooting for the standard grifter/new B2B service rate of $1,500 all in first contract value this puts you in the money as long as you have decent COGS. I would avoid email for B2C services and anything with less than $1K LTV in terms of gross profit - so once you‚Äôve netted out your expenses to fulfill the service your price needs to be $1,000 more than that. Assuming your customers will eventually buy again if they have success, or some sort of recurring relationship, worst case you‚Äôre shooting to conservatively break even on the initial contract once you factor in COGS and CAC and a fair market value for your time spent selling and seeking to profit off of retentions referrals and upsells.\n\nShoot for 95% deliverability, 30-40% open rates, and 25% of your replies being positive. Any metric substantially below these is killing you. Too much bounce -&gt; spam. Nobody opens your email -&gt; spam. People aren‚Äôt happy they got it -&gt; also spam. Keep in mind there‚Äôs an artificial 10% open rate baseline generated by programmatic clicks such as the inbox scanning links for malicious activity - so a 10% open rate means nobody is opening your email and a 20% open rate means 10% of people are. This is why youre shooting for 30-40 and 20% isn‚Äôt as good as it looks. If your bounce rate is over 5% scrub with neverbounce and keep valid emails and catch all emails, discard invalids and unknowns. End your emails with a question geared to start a conversation instead of asking for a meeting if response rates/happy responses are feeling too low.",

If you're not landing in the inbox none of it matters anyway. Most people wreck their domain reputation by blasting too many emails too fast.\n\nThe 10k from cold outreach claims are usually survivorship bias.

Most people spray and pray, but cold email only works when you're hyper-specific about who you're reaching and why they'd care. Are you segmenting by role, industry, company size? Is your copy speaking to their actual pain points, or is it generic?\n\nAlso, check your deliverability, if you're hitting spam, game over. Separate domain, proper authentication, gradual warm-up. And honestly, 300 emails isn't enough to validate anything. Real campaigns need volume plus precision.

The thing is, she plans to sell the spot in a couple years, and plans to sell it someone else who will take over it as a nail salon business, but for some reason in her mind it's ingrained to sell it simply at the cost of the location (not accounting for the cost of the business she built up, etc).

So 144k annual debt service, 100k for manager. You net 56k profit. That's how you know biz has value.\n\nReal estate is real estate and should be valued separately from business. Highest and best use might not be a nail salon...but keeps your rent costs fixed for the most part and likely makes that 300k profit grow over years.\n\nShort version: hire a small biz broker that's sold nail salons.

The more nail techs the more valuable the business. Also I want to know how many pedicures chairs the salon has, and the condition of the pedicure chairs. A pedicure chair can cost up to 10k to install plus the cost of the chair itself 1.5 to 4k. If the if the salon's chairs and furniture are too old that would decrease the value. \n\nYou haven't really given much valuable information to determine a prize. It could be as low as 100k or as high as 500k. You won't get 3x profits like some others suggest. My current place makes me 250k and I bought for 80k, I hope to sell it for 100k in a couple of years.",

If she has a longer-term lease locked in, this has value, especially for someone who wants to continue substantially the same business if there's a built-up clientele.  One assumes many of the techs and other employees would be willing to stay on with any reasonable new owner, so this really is a turnkey business your mom is handing over. \n\nIf the lease is short-term and there aren't clean renewal options at a fixed or structured price, she has a decision to make:  does she want to walk away without being able to sell it for too much, or would she want to get the landlord to agree to a lease extension, or option, that would enable her to bundle the sale per above.\n\nIf she owns the building, she should keep the building and become a landlord to the new owner, at the very least. Landlords in this situation have a lot of leverage, so even if she sells the business itself below market, then she could make up for it in time through reasonable rent increases.  \n\nIf owns but is planning to sell the building, my advice to you is, buy it and offer the new salon owner a long-term lease on terms that work for you both!   Even if you have to pay you mom back over time or something.  Then you can be the landlord per above.",

Equipment assets depreciate and during an ownership transfer clients tend to leave the business due to tech loyalty, not brand loyalty. Most salons tried to make as much cash as possible and not everyone has a good track record of proper bookkeeping making it hard to go through bank loans for the sale. Hence why it's more of a cash price and whatever is deemed decent in terms of assets and client list. You have to look at the comps in the area, if it costs less to lease and start a new business and profit all the same, why would other people buy the existing business for nearly a mil??",

Everything is performative, and many sell their soul for it.\n\nThe YouTube, TikTok, and social media game is oversaturated; that's like saying everyone is successful in the music or entertainment industry.\n\nBefore the Influencer was a thing, everyone was a singer, rapper, producer, and everyone had a record label. But when you look at Billboard, there were only the Top 100 or even 200. So, out of all these people, only 200 artists actually \"charted\"; the rest were struggling.\n\nThat's the same with social media; you have a few that fooled people into paying them thousands to give them a course on how to get rich. Why would they do that if they are already rich? If they have a successful company, they would focus on that, invest their money, and just do what they enjoy.\n\nMost of these \"public figures\" are conmen or women. They sell you a dream, and you go home with that dream, and you're going to continue working your job you hate.\n\nMany of these million-follower influencers live with 4 roommates and owe people money. That's the game.\n\nMaking money is hard if you do it the right way, not by scamming, stealing, or committing fraud.\n\nThe Liver King sold everyone on eating raw organ meat to think they could be shredded like him, but then came to find out he has been taking massive steroids forever.

The best entrepreneurs I have also met aren‚Äôt the loud ones shouting about their product; they‚Äôre the quiet observers who really see the problems people face and build thoughtful solutions for them.\n\nIf you are just starting out try focusing on solving a real problem you or someone around you faces often. The more frequent the problem the better. As Alex Hormozi says look for pain that happens every day or every week not once a year. That way your business lives in people‚Äôs day to day life not their once a year wish list.\n\nJeff Bezos used to say build around things that never change. People will always want convenience trust good service and something that saves them time or makes them feel good. When you build for what stays true you don‚Äôt need to chase trends. Build around those timeless needs instead of chasing trends.\n\nAnd because you‚Äôre introverted we already have the patience to think deeply and build quietly. That‚Äôs a strength. We don‚Äôt need to shout just solve something meaningful and let your work speak. We just need to help a few people really well.\n\nStart small. Observe deeply. Build patiently.

Stop using it as a reason not to start.\n\nYou don't need marketing expertise before starting, you learn by doing. Start by selling something to people you already know, get feedback, iterate. That's how everyone learns marketing, not by studying theory first.\n\nFor actually starting as a beginner: identify something you're good at or interested in, find 10 people who might need that thing, reach out and offer it to them, see if anyone bites. That validates whether there's demand before you invest time building infrastructure.\n\nOur clients who overthink \"how to start\" before doing anything usually never start. They research endlessly, plan perfectly, then get paralyzed by fear. Just pick something small and try selling it to one person. That teaches you more than any advice.\n\nCollege students have built-in advantages for starting businesses. You have a network of peers, low living expenses, and time to experiment. Use those instead of focusing on limitations like being introverted.\n\nCommon beginner businesses for college students: freelance services (writing, design, tutoring), dropshipping or selling products online, campus-focused services. Pick something with low startup costs so failure doesn't hurt financially.\n\nStop looking for permission or the perfect plan. Just start selling something, even if it's imperfect. You'll learn what works through real experience way faster than reading about how to start.\n\nBeing introverted might actually help because you'll focus on systems and processes instead of relying purely on personality to sell. Plenty of successful online businesses run by introverts who never meet customers face-to-face.\n\nPick something, offer it to 10 people, see what happens. That's your starting point, not endless research on how to begin.",

The whole promise is minimal effort (‚Äúget started in a day‚Äù) and boom, you have a $50,000 a month business. \n\nI‚Äôm not saying that there is no potential for success using any of these mediums - but rather there is soooo much work, research, and understanding of the customer that goes into forming a successful, and more importantly, lasting business.\n\nThere‚Äôs a reason why there are more 9-5 workers than business owners. A tale as old as time: ‚ÄúIf it were easy, everyone would do it‚Äù. \n\nTherefore, if you are trying to rush things because you are feeling left out of the ‚ÄúAI gold rush‚Äù or whatever the new ‚Äúbig opportunity‚Äù is, just remember business is a marathon, not a sprint as it portrayed so much on the internet today by people simply trying to sell you on a course. \n\nNobody in their right mind putting up those big numbers is going to have the time or energy to start a course and make 3 hour long YouTube videos about it. Remember that. \n\nCorrect me if I‚Äôm wrong on any of this but over the past 5ish years of trial, error, and observation, that has been my understanding.\n",

Comment 'Shorts' and blah blah blah\"\n\nI called them out on it because my shorts consistently get millions of views and I know the math. That was NOT a real screencap. Of course they hid my comment. \n\nAnyway, I pretty much focus on providing as much evidence as I can for my course like 'here's my results, heres my channel, go look for yourself, if you want to learn how i make my shorts, take my course'\n\nNot in those words but you know what I mean. Everything sucks so bad these days you cant trust anyone.. and now, companies are making Ai UGC ads!?\n\nLike fake people talking about how they use their product. Not actors, not influencers, and definitely not real customers. Just Ai. I hope some day the hammer drops and every business that made Ai UGC ads unethically (meaning not disclosed ai) gets publicly shamed.\n\nSorry. I did not expect this rant to come out.\n\nAll that said, some of the people ive learned the most from are called 'gurus'\n\nLike Hormozi. I have his books. Man I have learned so much from those damn things. Russell Brunson too.\n\nSome people start to get tired of the content these advice givers put out because they say 'its all the same shit!' And they're right. When people like that start to sound repetitive, it means youre done learning what they have to say.\n\nAs someone whos been called a Youtube Guru, Ive been accused of saying the same thing over and over and it was true. Either because new youtubers would ask me the same questions on livestreams, or because theres only so much advice to give. The talking points dont change very often.\n\nAnyway, this comment got away from me. When I get tired of someone's advice, I stop watching. It doesnt mean they dont have anything valuable to offer though.",

I have about 250 Instagram followers, don't have a TikTok account, and my Facebook Group has about 50 members. \n\nHowever, I make about $15k-$17k a month (full-time, started as a side hustle, walked away from the 9-5 in 2022), and I'm trending towards $20k months in the near future. \n\nHere's what I've learned. People put WAY too much stock in attention (follows and likes). What's FAR more important is building trust with people. I was listening to a podcast recently, and Seth Godin said something that I love. \n\nI'm probably paraphrasing here, but he said \"Marketing is telling a true story to people who want to hear it, and creating a story that people want to spread. \"Likes\" doesn't mean anyone likes you, \"friends\" doesn't mean they're your friend, and \"followers\" doesn't mean they're following you. What you have to do is figure out how to matter.\" - Seth Godin. \n\nWhat works for me is building strong, 1:1 relationships with as many people as I can. And helping people, with no expectation of anything in return. Find people's specific pain points, and help them solve a problem. \n\nI'm going to give you a very recent example....   \n  \nI commented on someone's Reddit post the other day... it was just my heartfelt attempt to help someone who was struggling. \n\nA guy read my comment and thought, \"I have to talk to him! He's speaking directly to what I'm going through.\" But then, as he told me later, he accidentally closed the Reddit window and couldn't find the post or the comment. He said she started to panic. But then he remembered that he had opened a separate window from my Reddit bio and was able to reach me.   \n  \nHe reached out and booked a call with me. We talked for over an hour, and he's now a coaching client. I didn't do any marketing, and there was no promotion on my part. I didn't even try to pitch him on my coaching services. But after spending an hour on the phone with me (for free), he was like \"I need to work with you\". \n\nAnyways, my point is... find ways to help people solve a real problem they are struggling with, one person at a time. \n\nFocus on trust, not attention!",

How did you find them? Where were you when you found them and what led you to commit to buy?\n\nChoose a target market with a problem you can figure out how to solve. Then figure out where those people in your target group are - online, offline, driving around looking at billboards, reading the New Yorker, members of a local social/athletic club, watching the nightly news, joggers at a specific park? If your target people only buy from TikTokkers, scratch that business (or target) off the list and keep looking until you find a target market you can address in ways that you are particularly good at (or can fake it until you hire).\n\nI did well when I started an IT services business because I knew what I was doing, had a solid pedigree from my previous employer and contacts which I'd been building for years. I attended networking events (think of rotary, or your local chamber of commerce), which lead to a lot of top of funnel opportunity because there I could find my target market - small and mid sized business owners. As I proved myself, my clients started referring me to their business friends. And SEO work + various direct marketing campaigns brought the people at those companies to me who knew they had a problem to solve before they met me. \n\nEntrepreneurs solve the puzzles, but they don't necessarily have to do all the work directly.",

This year, thanks to AI especially, our engineering team was able to move atleast 2x faster, and we were able to do a lot of stuff that we used outsource to contractors on Upwork/Fiverr in house. I just pulled up our Mercury report and here are all the new tools we have been paying for this year\n\n1. Cursor and Windsurf: Everyone in our team gets either Cursor or Windsurf paid for. I am personally a huge fan of Windsurf cascade agent. Its been able to make huge changes to our app on it own from simple prompts. We mostly just have to test the changes, review the code and just push it to deployment lately. Our team is moving definitely 2x faster with the same headcount. We use the Sonnet model almost unanimously inside our old!\n2. Google Nano Banana &amp; Veo 3: We used to hire contractors to make product images, photoshoots, videos for social media/ads etc. Google Nano Banana has mostly replaced all of that. It is great how it can take a product and change colors etc, and turn it into full blown photoshoots with models etc in seconds. And then you can just use it as a first frame in Veo 3 to make a full video/reel from it. Crazy!\n3. Frizerly: Its a great AI agent that learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website helping us improve our Google ranking. Saves me and my team 10+ hours every week!¬†We used to hire contractors on Fiverr/Upwork earlier for this!\n4. Intercom Fin: We had an issue where whatever we do and document on our website, people kept asking some obvious questions on chat taking up valuable support bandwidth. Now Fin can auto resolve these questions instantly. Other questions get auto routed to real people so that people are not mad as well!¬†!¬†\n5. Lovable &amp; Bolt: Our marketing team now quickly spins up landing pages, lead gens using Lovable/Bolt instead of having to wait for engineering or external contractors. It's not great complex apps for SAAS etc but it's great for marketing landing pages, and simple stuff!¬†\n6. ChatGPT: Obvious, but everyone in our team gets ChatGPT to brainstorm, summarize reports etc\n7. N8N: To automate lots of workflows inside our org.\n\nCurious what others are using tho!",

Now everything flows through n8n, from Smartlead data to Slack summaries. Each AM saves around 6 hours a week.\n2. **Supabase + Clay:** Our Apollo data lives inside Supabase, and Clay is our main research engine. It enriches and segments leads automatically instead of relying on VAs. Lead quality and positive replies both went up noticeably.\n3. **Claude + Claude Projects:** We use Claude for thinking, writing, and debugging ideas. Its Projects feature is perfect for keeping consistent tone across client reports and campaign analyses. It replaced hours of doc writing and alignment calls.\n4. **Lovable / Codex / Cursor / Bolt:** Still experimenting with these to build our internal reporting and client dashboards. The goal is a fully ‚Äúvibecoded‚Äù platform that looks great but runs straight on live campaign data from our DB.\n5. **Slack + custom bots:** Every campaign‚Äôs health, domain status, and weekly CDRs now post directly to Slack. No dashboards to check, no files to pull. Keeps the team synced in real time.\n\nThis year has been more about wiring everything together using the small pieces that have been out in the market and gained enough stability to not break our systems. \n\nOverall, all of this implmented results in the systems running smoothly and the team focussing only on thinking and strategy.",

          "body": "I have felt this exact thing.  \n\nFor four years, I commuted to my 9-5 as a bank manager, then jumped into my freelance side hustle in the evenings and on the weekends. Not to mention a busy home life...married, three teenage kids. But I kept at it, and in September 2022, when my side hustle income exceeeded my banking income (around $120k/year), I called my boss and told him I was done. Two weeks later, I walked out of my office for the last time. One of the best feelings of my life.   \n  \nBut, the climb was not easy. Here are some things that worked for me to balance the 9-5 with my business and family commitments.   \n  \n1. I paced myself. So, I would work an hour or so most evenings, and then do 2-3 hours on a Saturday morning or Sunday afternoon. There were times when I had to go harder than that, but I learned how much you can get done by just doing something (almost) every day. \n\n2. I maximized my commute and my lunch hours at work. I would listen to my business podcasts and audiobooks during my hour-long commute each day. I had my laptop with me, and I often worked on my side hustle on my lunch hours. That way, I had less work in the evenings, giving me more family time. \n\n3. I was patient. In hindsight, I could have pushed harder and left my job after maybe 2 or 3 years. But it took me 4, because I wasn't willing to sacrifice my marriage, my family, etc. I knew that I was making progress and that it was only a matter of time. And that was all the motivation I needed. I saw the light at the end of the tunnel. \n\n4. I read Atomic Habits early on and implemented 5 or 6 key habits that boosted my productivity. I know it almost sounds cliche to mention AH, but this book was transformational for me. Some of the concepts I used were setting my environment, reducing friction on good habits, and increasing friction on bad ones, habit stacking. I also started time-blocking my calendar. \n\n5. I never missed date nights with my wife. If you're married, you really can't succeed with entrepreneurship without a supportive spouse. And I made sure that my wife knew that she was always my number 1 priority. We stuck to our weekly (sometimes bi-weekly) date nights. This helped us stay on track, make sure we're getting a break from the house, and communicating with each other. \n\n6. I almost never missed my kids activities. I always made this a priority, and it helped me stay balanced and understand what's truly important in life. \n\nHere's the beauty of all of this. Because I pushed hard for those 4 years, my life is SO much better today. I have a fully remote freelancing/coaching business that I run from my laptop. My wife is at home with me full-time, helps me with my business. I love the work I do, I have full control over my time, no boss making unrealistic demands, no pointless meetings. My wife and I travel several times a year. \n\nIt's 100% worth the effort, but you have to do it right!",

So convince them to go away by being expensive. The ones who value your work will pay for your value.\n\nThe other thing I made sure to do is there are customers who haggle everything.  It's who they are. Typically they are fresh from countries where you DO haggle everything.  They are not bad customers, but they want to haggle. So after that first time I went into my computer and raised their rates 10% for parts and labor.  Then I would let them \"haggle\" me down to my normal rates.  I got what I wanted, they got what they wanted.",

They would have to travel 2 hours north to LA just to get a something a couple dollars cheaper. \n\nWe still get asswipes trying to get a discount. Multiple interactions: \n\n\n\n-*\"If I buy two, will you give me the second for half price?\"*  (Dude...) the guy I sold a 100 units to just now, didn't get a single dollar off. (What makes you think your measly two piece order is going to sway me?) \n\n\n\n-*\"If I buy a dozen, how much will you give it to me for?\"* Same price as labeled (in bold 250 point font on the product itself, need me to read it to you fuck face!?!)  *\"Ok, if I buy ten of these, how much for me?\"* (Again,) if you take one or a hundred, the price is the same. *\"What about if I take 30 pieces of this one, how much for me?\"* (OMFG!!  I start blinking slower and narrow my eyes a bit) If you order a truck container's worth of product, pay it in full up front, and wait 2-3 months, and agree to storage fees if you don't pick up immediately, I can give you a decent discount. \n\n\n\n-*\"But I always get a lower price than this\"* (No one does) Only the boss can give you a discount, he's on vacation, and returns next month, you can come back then. *\"No that's ok, I need it now\"* (If you clean up my inventory at a discount, I too need to replenish now, but my NOW is going to take 2-3 months to get my order from China. So selling at a discount is not to our benefit) \n\n\n\nWhen I start getting tired of them, I actually send them to my competitor without directly saying gtfo. They come back and pay my asking price without any more haggling.\n\nEdit: Just yesterday. I had a guy who was from our same hometown in Syria. Never met him before here. He thinks because we're both Syrian, he's going to convince me with his bullshit. He wanted to invest his money, and take zero risk. That he wanted to take 10 units of our product, he wants it at a discount, AND (here's the kicker) wants it on consignment, so that if he doesn't re-sell the product successfully, he can return it and get his money back even though we have 5 signs All Sales Final and No Returns No Exchange signs spread out across our showroom. This one in particular was kinda fun to knock him off his high horse watching him deflate when I wouldn't budge on any of his negotiation attempts.",

For three years I kept walk in hours because I thought thats what customers wanted and I was terrified of losing business.\n\nThe reality was way different tho. Id have people walk in right when Im in the middle of a hem on a wedding dress, or Id block out time to finish rush orders and then spend 45 minutes with someone who just wanted to ask if I could fix their jacket zipper (which I dont even do). My actual turnaround times were getting worse because I couldnt focus.\n\nI spent like two months researching what other alterations places were doing, talked to my regular customers, even checked polymarket to see what the recession odds were since I was worried people would stop spending on alterations if the economy tanked. But mostly I just tracked my own numbers for a month and realized that 60% of walk ins either didnt book anything or wanted services I dont offer.\n\nMade the switch to appointment only in September. Put up signs, updated my google business, sent emails to my regular clients. First week I was stressed as hell thinking my phone would stop ringing.\n\nOpposite happened. My schedule is actually FULLER now because people book in advance and I can plan my day properly. Im finishing work faster, taking on more jobs, and honestly my stress levels dropped like crazy. Plus the clients who book appointments tend to be more serious and respectful of my time.\n\nOnly downside is I do get the occasional person who shows up anyway and gets annoyed when I cant help them right then. But honestly thats on them for not reading the giant sign on my door lol\n\nIf youre on the fence about this just do it.

I‚Äôll keep you updated on how it goes.  \n  \nI‚Äôm considering trying to buy Instagram followers just to give my profile a small boost, but my main concern is safety. I‚Äôve read that if you buy from the wrong site especially those that use bots, your account could get flagged or the followers will just disappear in a few days.\n\nHas anyone here found a legit site that provides real looking followers that actually stay? I‚Äôd really appreciate hearing which service you used and whether it felt worth it in the long run.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to figure out:\n\n* What‚Äôs the best place to buy real Instagram followers that don‚Äôt drop overnight?\n* Can buying Instagram followers actually help with reach or engagement?\n* Which sites sell safe, high-quality Instagram followers that look authentic?\n\nAny recommendations are appreciated!",

I have never seen someone buy followers and later be glad they did it. \n\nIf you want to buy something, put $5/day on your posts for 7 days, and tell Meta to use your profile visits and followers as a model. Reach is super cheap and more exposure to non-followers will increase their likelihood to choose to follow you. And THAT is what you want.",

      "selftext": "We operate a horseback riding business. Obviously, this requires physical ability and makes people prone to injury as they are getting on/off horses. Over the past few years, we have had families bring elderly relatives - people in their 80s and 90s, some with very frail bones or broken hips. This is extremely dangerous as they cannot easily get on/off the horse. Some of them are so immobile they cannot even walk from their cars to our staging area let alone get on a horse.\n\nToday we had an elderly fall off the horse and smash her head open.\n\nI want to be able to legally refuse service to people in such a condition. Here is the problem, federal law (Age Discrimination Act of 1975) does not permit us to discriminate based on age or disability. So we are in a gray area here.\n\nI do not want elderly people who are physically immobile to use our service and if they show up I want to be able to legally deny them, but I do not want to violate federal discrimination laws (such as Age Discrimination Act of 1975) and get sued. Are there any out clauses in the law that we can use for denying service based on it being say \"a risk to that person's safety\" or something? Of course I don't know if we are subject to federal age discrimination laws as we are a private company and do not receive federal funding.\n\nDoes anyone know a way around this. I'm thinking if we make a 'safety and risk' policy for ALL customers instead of just elderly that would work. Any info would be appreciated.\n\n  \nWe do have liability waivers customers sign but I still do not want people getting injured.",

Add in that you can make exceptions to this rule if needed and then you can quietly let kids or anyone you need to skip the requirement but not great aunt Agnes. \n\nHere is the most important part though, set up a nice waiting area so Agnes has something to do somewhere. Mount a TV in the tack room, add a few chairs and play Seabiscuit on a loop. Psychologically no one wants Agnes on the horse they just don't want her sitting in a hot car while they have fun. If you give her a chair and a vending machine somewhere they will ditch her there and feel zero pressure to put her on a horse. It doesn't have to be fancy it just has to look like whoever doesn't go riding will have somewhere to be that is shaded and comfortable. \n\nWe started with just a few seats and a shelf of books and eventually built it up to a pay-fridge, microwave and some pinball machines which paid for themselves immediately.",

Is Squarespace better for long-term growth or does Wordpress still have the most flexibility?

      "selftext": "I have recently started my own small business. I thought it would make me financially independent, as I cannot work in a normal job like everyone else because of my Bipolar Disorder. But the moment I started my business, I began facing many issues.\n\nThe first issue was trusting vendors I met online. I foolishly got scammed by fake vendors who sent me realistic invoices, but the products never arrived. This drained my savings and made my family lose trust in me. So instead of taking a big loan and a big risk, I decided to start a small business with a small loan‚Äîwithout realizing that there would be many gatekeepers, hidden costs, and the challenge of operating without working capital.\n\nI finally found an honest vendor who provided me with my goods, but our definitions of ‚Äúgood quality‚Äù were very different due to social status. I wanted to sell to middle and upper-middle-class people, but he thought the same quality applies for all. In India, there is also so much paperwork, and I got scammed by those who handle documentation. I was overcharged by those who made my labels.\n\nI am the first person in generations of my family and caste to ever start a business, so we had no inside knowledge. My own friends who come from business castes acted as gatekeepers‚Äîbecause that‚Äôs what they are taught. I tried to find distributors for my product, but most of them first take the product and then pay only if it‚Äôs sold. This meant I would have to blindly trust them, because even with proper documentation, no legal authorities would care or intervene if they cheated. They know that, and they take advantage of it.\n\nNow, I have a lot of products and no way to sell them. Social media marketing attracted a few friends and supporters to buy, but then the Postal Department refused to send my product because it‚Äôs food. I had to rely on private couriers, which cut all my margins. Nobody reveals where to buy cheap packaging, how to deliver packages at low cost, or how to find honest distributors.\n\nIn India, I think society is designed to keep new entrants out of business and to preserve business opportunities only for certain communities, while keeping the rest of society enslaved to corporates‚Äîso they continue buying from these same communities when it comes to small-scale businesses.",

What you described, gatekeeping, opaque systems, unreliable partners, can make entrepreneurship feel way lonelier than people expect.\n\nOne of my professors likes to say that running a small business is ‚Äúan endurance game of controlled chaos,‚Äù and that really stuck with me. You‚Äôve already shown a lot of resilience by adapting. Those scars are actually the foundation most real entrepreneurs build on, it‚Äôs just that people rarely talk about them publicly.\n\nIf you‚Äôre still up for it, one thing that might help is connecting with local small business networks or accelerators, not the flashy startup ones, but those that focus on local trade or regional entrepreneurs. Even informal WhatsApp or Facebook groups can be gold for getting tips on packaging, logistics, or honest vendors. A few classmates doing ventures in emerging markets leaned heavily on those kinds of micro-communities; they‚Äôre messy but real.\n\nYou‚Äôre right that the system isn‚Äôt designed to make it easy, but the persistence you‚Äôve already shown puts you ahead of most people who stop at the first setback. I hope you don‚Äôt lose that spark even if you pause for a while. This experience will 100% shape how you think about business (and people) going forward.",

I'm currently applying for jobs, because I just need a \"break\" of trying to hustle and solve every problem myself. At least with a job, you get paid, no matter what. Maybe you should try to find a job that's just \"simple\", like work in retail or a quiet restaurant, or something... at least for a little while, to build back up your funds. Then still work part-time at least, so you don't have to take out more loans and stuff. Most importantly, I hope you're getting proper treatment for your BPD. All the best! üôèüèΩ",

How many do you have to sell to make a decent profit? How much will advertising cost? What about shipping costs? Tax costs? He puts it all into a spreadsheet and does a month to month run through. Will there be delays due to holidays? Flaky middle sellers? Rising in shipping costs? Drop in market demand? Competitors pricing you out? What can you tolerate? How low can you go? How much time and effort and money will all this cost? Can you do it alone? If you have to hire someone how does that complicate your business and life in terms of time, effort, money, profit, trust, taxes, and laws? All this is investigated and lightedly tested before even considering dropping the 9-5 job. \n\n2. The Deep-End Jumper: This guy thinks he'll figure out how to run a business after leaving his job, starting the business with little consideration of the risks and realities of the business and figures he'll learn on the way through mistakes (usually costly ones). \n\nThat said number 2 is typical type. Those who make it as number 2s usually don't quit no matter what it cost them - and it probably cost them a lot.",

It's been a good run, but after all these years I'm trying to figure out if now is the right time and what kind of valuation I should realistically expect.\n\nThe site is monetized through advertising, primarily Google AdSense (around 55%), though I've diversified over the years with other ad networks and direct sponsors. All traffic is organic (SEO-driven), and I run a very lean operation.\n\nLast 12 months the business did about $1.3M in revenue with roughly $1.16M in profit (around 90% margins).\n\nHere's where I'm struggling: I've heard wildly different numbers on multiples. Some say sites like this trade at 3x SDE/EBITDA (especially from competitors), while others mention 5-6x or even higher for strategic buyers who see specific synergies.\n\nFor those of you who've recently sold similar businesses, what kind of multiple did you actually get? And what should I be realistically targeting here?\n\nAny guidance would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

          "body": "To value a business you look at the past several year's average free cash flow (how much money truly available to spend, so not profit) and then divide that by the relative risk of the business (20% for a super super low risk business, 40%+ for a high risk business). That's basically it, the hard part is determining appropriate free cash flow and risk. You can subtract the expected continued growth rate from risk if you'd expect it to keep growing. \n\nYou say 1.1 in profit, are there any costs not included in that? Does that include your salary (fair market to replace you?). Let's say it's actually $900k in free cash flow this year, but an average of $800k over the last 3 years. So let's say your business grows ~10% every year and can reasonably expect that to continue. \n\nIt's a website, that has inherent risk as it's very low barrier to entry for competitors. How vital are you to the success so far? Losing you would be risky. If I had to guess, id think an investor would determine maybe a 35% risk rating. \n\nTherefore the value in this example is: $800k/(0.35-0.1) = $3.2M. You can play with those numbers as you want, but you'll have to convince an investor why they are different. Hopefully this semi helps you understand how to value your/any business.",

Mainly focused on web design then started expanding into other services as my clients started requesting (facebook ads, google, funnels, etc.) so I just turned into a full stack agency.\n\nFirst year was hell and really tough but I pushed through and started getting some clients on a recurring basis. Most of them still with me right now.\n\nPricing is different per client some pay 2k/mo while others pay 1.2k or 1.6k depending on the scope.\n\nUp until 5 months ago I was mostly doing everything myself and just recently got some people to help me out.\n\nI have a media buyer who I pay 1.2k/mo for 3 ad accounts he manages for me and a design agency I started paying 1.5k/mo to take over all the creative production and design for me.\n\nMinus other expenses to run the business it brings my profit to around 5k/mo and I feel thays pretty good considering I‚Äôve never seen that money before and I used to make less than 1,600 every month before this business.\n\nSorry about all the details but now to my actual question. I no longer feel the same drive that I used to have when I started my business. \n\nI remember putting in 12+ hours every single day and not being able to sleep because I had so many ideas I wanted to execute. Every day I would wake up excited to get to work. \n\nNow I have to force myself to work. Dealing with clients, messaging, revisions, out of scope requests, etc. is just irritating now. Every time I hear my phone ring with a whatsapp I feel some type of anger and frustration because It‚Äôs going to be some client asking for more things.\n\nAnd I get it sometimes it sucks and you do need to eat shit for a while but I no longer enjoy what I do.\n\nI started the business because I genuinely wanted to help these businesses but now I can‚Äôt find that passion or energy to work again. \n\nSo I‚Äôm wondering if I should eat shit a little longer and see if I can fix things. Maybe focus on systems and what I can do to actually go back to how I felt.\n\nOr if I should listen to this constant dialogue to just close everything down and start something else.\n\nAnd if I‚Äôm just whining too much and being a bitch just tell me straight up. I‚Äôm the type of person that prefers things straight up hahah so won‚Äôt hurt, it‚Äôs encouraged.\n\nIm curious what are any of your thoughts or ideas on what I could do? It would really help. Thank you for reading.\n",

Try to take a break soon, but not a total disconnect - unplug from the day to day \"tyranny of the urgent\" and spend some time mixed between relaxing and thinking about the things that got you excited in the first place. Catch up on YouTube videos etc whatever content in your niche that you watched when you were hungry early on. Reflect on how you've learned and grown, and rediscover what caught your interest in the first place. Come back with a refreshed perspective. \n\n2) no more WhatsApp. Force your clients to use a professional communication method like email, where things can be categorized, tagged, and prioritized instead of being on call without a salary \n\n3) think about whether your current tier of clients are the kind you want to work with long term. In my experience, the lower end of the market is where most of the needy, micromanaging clients are. If you've got the chops on the team to service upmarket clients, consider raising rates to price out some of the low end. You can take fewer clients for more money and less stress.",

What people don't tell you when you start an agency is that you aren't your own boss - you have 10 bosses on many different projects that you aren't all that interested in. Making payroll each month was tough. I had all sorts of health problems that stemmed from working constantly and being under so much stress. When we'd get a good contract for like $100k, the client ended up owning us and wanting most of our time and attention. It was difficult to sub out work to reliable contractors, but doing everything in house didn't scale.\n\nI don't want to discourage you, but it sounds like you are already picking up on what the road ahead looks like. I wouldn't say it's easier to start any other type of business, and it is especially hard to launch and grow a SaaS product. However, jobs tend to be pretty easy in my opinion, but the market is rough right now. I'd say to explore multiple options.",

He wasn‚Äôt lazy or unskilled. At the beginning he was one of the most reliable people on the team. But over time something shifted. Tasks took longer, communication became distant, and it started to feel like he was working just to fill hours instead of driving things forward.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt dramatic or toxic, just that slow fade where motivation disappears. We tried to talk things through, but nothing really changed. In the end, keeping him on didn‚Äôt feel fair to him or to us.\n\nWhat surprised me most was how heavy it felt afterward. I actually liked the guy, and I kept wondering if I could have done more to help him reconnect. The next day, I spoke with another developer who has been working with us for a while, consistent, reliable, never any drama. I took a moment to thank her for her work, and she seemed genuinely touched.\n\nIt made me realize how often we forget to appreciate the people who quietly do things right until something goes wrong somewhere else.\n\nHave you been through something similar in your business?

No one will ever give a shit about your business as much as the owners of the business, and you can't ever expect them to.\n\nSounds like you let a good relationship end because you couldn't set proper terms.\n\nedit: also generally speaking, sometimes employees are overambitious early on, think of it as the \"honeymoon stage\", they might feel like they have something to prove, or be all starry-eyed, and reality is that it can just fade over time, especially if their expectations are not in line with reality, if they had high hopes for things, and eventually realize that reality is not as glamorous or exciting as they imagined. We all like to gas ourselves up like we're great employers, but sometimes employees also feel undercompensated (and sometimes are actually undercompensated relative to the market) and that's something else that can disillusion them. So it's completely normal to see an employee who was once a star, eventually fade into \"just average\" over time. It sucks but it's normal.",

Or how much you are a squad leader after playing CoD?\n\nTake for example [software.inc](http://software.inc) \\- pretty realistic in aspects and perspective, but cuts down the micro- and macro- management you'll need to do during all steps.\n\nAccounting is heavy in most business. It's actually the biggest pain point of any business. In the game it's literally few clicks and \"work on loan application\" &lt;- that loan application is a effing pita which might turn into several years if your books are crap.\n\nYou will have issues with inventory which any game won't show, for example it is easier to hold to old electronics I have instead of selling them off or throwing them out because they expired and if company throws them out then it is extra payment, if you sell it - it will take much more time to post it up and negotiate than you'll make back. Selling to liquidator is easier but you need bulk amount to make it viable financially. So you are stuck with old hardware for plenty of time. In the game you just upgrade it for the price of the new system which is not true in reality.\n\nI'm not even talking about HR or other things like working longer means better results - this is all false.\n\nThe very vital inventory is messed up by default in all games, you don't need to figure out location for everything based on size, material, usage rate etc.\n\nThen don't forget financials are always messed up in games - you have regulations, requirements etc.\n\nI like business games because they are very relaxing for me and easy, because everything is intuitive and straightforward.\n\nIRL you will be fumbled by how many layers there are to very simple things you'd never even think of.\n\nThat is why it is important to start trying business early in your lifetime - first and foremost is ability to zone-out into another charismatic person and talk to people, you'll get tired but you'll be selling to people. Thankfully mine is online only but if it happens offline I'm trying to be the most cheerful person out there (i have resting bitch-face by default though).",

If you had the agreement in writing (always a good idea) then there's a potential legal liability for them.\n\nHowever if they don't have the money they can't pay you, but it shows little sensitivity on their part to say it's not a priority. If I were them I'd be trying to keep you on side so you don't cause problems on top of what they already have.\n\nOnly you can decide whether to drop them. There's no point working for them if they go bust and can't pay, and so it comes down to how confident you are that you will at least get paid eventually and what the gap means for you in terms of your own cash flow. Whether you can find alternative work will also play into it.\n\nGood luck.",

I recently helped another business owner identify this with their two client model paying them 90% of revenue and helped them switch away from that model. It takes work but it‚Äôs doable in most scenarios. \n\nMy suggestion, work amicably while building your business away from the one major client model. Identify your best services and build a real client base in the meantime. Then you can drop thay client or any client in the future without financial ruin and be in charge of your business. \n\nHope this helps!",

What I have learned after being in business for close  to 35 years is that there is a segment of the population that operates from a position of how they can get one over on the business....they go into the transaction with that in mind....they are looking for a discount, a freebie, an argument to justify refusing to pay, etc. They set this up to hold you essentially hostage. You should always be in the position of control and authority. \n\nCan I ask what type of work (or product, item) you do? When customers start that type of behavior I refuse to give them their item/work until it is paid in full. I also require all of them to pay a 50% deposit upfront. I have had to contact the police to remove irate customers, I have thrown customers out of the shop that are out of line, and I have played hard ball when necessary (suggesting involving the court). Their inability to conduct themselves properly, read documents thoroughly, ask questions and so on is not our problem but, in theory, becomes our problem. If it starts difficult, it will end difficult. I want to earn money but I will refuse to chase down or deal with the difficult customers as it never ends well. A mentor always told me \"not all money is good money.\" Even if you perform to standard and deliver, it still ends with them bad mouthing your business. \n\nYou need to learn to stand your ground. Be a professional but be firm. Are you rushing to correct this order and doing it for free? Did they bully you into that....I want it fixed and I want it tomorrow? Did you charge them for the rush job and the additional requests?",
