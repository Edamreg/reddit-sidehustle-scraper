      "selftext": "I am about 25k in debt and it feels really heavy right now. If I could just make a bit more than 20 dollars a day for a few years, I could slowly dig myself out. The problem is I do not have the time or energy for a second full time job.\n\nI am not great at big business ideas. The only thing I can imagine is something small online, like selling a few simple products or a tiny ecommerce page. A friend told me I should not overthink it and just put up a very simple site first, using one of those one sentence website tools like genstore to get the basic store in place, then slowly fix the text and layout later. It sounds nice in theory, but I am not sure if I am just running away from learning real skills.\n\nIf you only had one or two hours a day and a goal like “just make 20 extra dollars,” would you spend that time learning more skills, or would you push out a tiny store as fast as possible and see what happens I would really like to hear from people who used a very small side project to pay off debt or at least make it less scary.",

You basically post yourself as being available for odd jobs. Could be anything from cleaning, organizing, yard work, etc.  Any odd job around the house you can think of you can find someone on Task Rabbit to do. You set your price and you work with the client to set specific day and time so you can work around your schedule to some degree.",

I try to join better paid survey panels and treat the rest as pocket money, the key is to do them regularly. Sometimes I also use sites like Clickworker to take small tasks, usually around five to six dollars each.\n\nAnother part is Fiverr. I take orders there for website and app testing and give user feedback. This does need some basic skills and you also have to spend time building your profile and reviews, so the beginning is slow.\n\nI also do some niche reselling. I look for small rare items that some people still want, like merch from certain communities or old devices that are no longer made. I buy them cheap, clean them up and resell them. This part depends a lot on information gaps.\n\nThe newest part is using AI to make commercial videos for clients. I write a full script at home first, then use the commercial video templates in MovieFlow to create an AI version of the video. After that I bring it into an editor to fix the pacing, visuals and subtitles, then send the final video to the client for their website or social media. The pay for this is usually higher than normal small tasks.\n\nAll of these can be done from home and do not need a huge upfront cost. I am curious what legal at home side hustles are the most stable or most worth recommending for you. Is there anything you feel a normal person could start without a big risk or huge budget",

          "body": "This requires some self-reflection on your part. It sounds like you have never worked an office job -- could you tolerate sitting at a desk all day? If office work seems ok, there are options that don't require a degree (though that may vary based on individual company requirements). Things like insurance claims adjuster and office/administrative assistant often don't require a degree. Plus there are ones that most people prefer to avoid, like call center, telemarketing, and some sales roles.\n\nWhat about challenging working conditions (hot, cold, outdoors, on roofs, in attics, heaving lifting)? I'd guess you've had some of that in restaurants, but think about how having that all the time would be. That could make some options in trades less attractive. On the other hand, there are lots of trades that don't necessarily have that kind of drawback (or with less frequency that may not put you off from those jobs entirely). There are the well known trades like carpenter, electrician, plumber, HVAC, auto mechanic, etc... that can pay well. But if you think that might be for you, you should also do a deep dive into the less talked about trades like pipefitter, welder, solar installer, wind turbine technician, diesel mechanic, aircraft mechanic, elevator repair or installer. You might find something of interest that you never really thought about, or knew existed. There are also a whole range of equipment operator jobs that require varying degrees of training (crane, backhoe, forklift, excavator, bulldozer, paving equipment) that you can look into as well.\n\nWhat about bodily fluids and/or working with people who might be sick? If that doesn't bother you, there are some entry points in healthcare that don't require extensive training. Certified Nursing assistant (CNA) is, I believe, about a six week training program. Things like radiology tech, MRI tech, dental hygienist, opthalmic assistant, and similar roles generally require an associate's degree and perhaps some specialized training (possibly on the job training) on top of that. There are lots of other related jobs, too, with varying amounts of training required such as home health aide, massage therapist, Hearing Aid Specialist, pharmacy technician, etc.... Plus most of those work locations need medical office assistants for paperwork, billing, appointment setting, and all the other administrative work. There are certifications for that which may range from a few months to a two-year degree or equivalent.\n\nIf you like animals veterinary assistant programs, I believe, can be completed in a few months. Or veterinary technician (which is typically an associate's degree) could be an option longer term.\n\nYou might also consider non-restaurant hospitality jobs, like various hotel/resort roles. You may need a degree to advance in some of these, especially getting into management roles. Flight attendant might also be worth looking into, unless you want to get away from restaurants because you don't want to deal with customers and/or be on your feet all day.\n\nThen there are jobs most people don't think about, like crime scene cleanup, remediation/restoration technician (either crime scene related, or post fire/flood/accident), pest control, and probably many others that are not on most people's radar (mine included).\n\ntl;dr: Try to think of jobs with elements that may appeal to you (for example maybe creativity, even pace, working with your hands, working with people) and eliminate ones that feature (prominently -- if you can tolerate in small doses, don't necessarily exclude jobs that only have the thing in small doses) things you would hate (e.g. working in unpleasant environments, sitting all day, working with people*).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*I don't know OP, so I don't know if working with people would be a big plus or major downside, hence it being a possibility on both lists.",

Those pay you while they train you for the job (lots in construction type work and once you finish the $ is amazing + you’re in a union) \n\n2. Teaching Fellowships. There’s an alternative way to become a teacher that you don’t need a degree to do. These fellowships pay you while you work + they train you + you get your teaching certification. \n\n\n3. Data Analytics/Cyber Security/ Software Engineer Programs - Lots of these training programs are either free, pay while you train, or set you up for a job once you graduate. \n\n4. If you’re down to relocate - Border Patrol. They pay for relocation something like 10/20K, good pay, pension, benefits. Most places in need are in random places but will give you a fresh start. \n\n5 National Parks - Always have a bunch of different positions available and offer training if you’re more of a nature buff.\n\n6. If you want international travel - ESL teaching overseas. You’re paid to live in another country and teach English to natives. They pay for housing + give you a salary. You can get certified for this online + see a list of countries hiring US citizens + what they offer. \n\n7. Adding in to check for Civil Service Exams + positions open. Depending on your income you can get waivers for the exam fees and take these for free. \n\n\nHope this helps and any ? ask away. Good Luck! 🤞🏼",

I make no money on social media because most of these platform don't allow monetization in my country or if they allow it's so hard for small creators to make anything.\n\nHowever, I taught myself some skills on YouTube and got certified as a virtual assistant. I have been selling these skills online. Sometimes, it can be hard to get clients, but give it time.

That's going to be hard if you don't have a support system outside of your home, but you have to expect that there will be attempts to sabotage anything you're doing to improve yourself and remove the amount of control they have over your life right now. Do what you can to find some real friends in your area to connect with. Start slowly leaving the house more often. Have a friend teach you how to drive until you can get your license, without telling your family. I'm assuming they wouldn't let you borrow their car to use on your driving test. Idk if there are driving schools in your area that can help with that or if a friend will let you use theirs. Where I live you have to provide a car to drive for the road test when getting your license.\n\nPeople don't understand that if you don't have money, can't drive legally, and don't have a support system, it's not as easy as just leaving. Leave and go where? Any skills you start learning, keep it to yourself as much as possible. Any money you start saving up, keep it a secret. If your family is using you as their free caregiver and servant, you have to expect that upsetting the status quo is going to upset them and that they'll do their best to stop it. When I was 19, I had to move out of state before I could get control over my life and money finally. It got to the point where my parents started using the money I made at my job and set aside for my tuition and savings towards moving out for fun gifts for themselves. There's a huge difference between being ungrateful and being in a highly controlling and abusive home where your parents aren't allowing you to lead an independent life or learn the skills you need in order to do that.

I’ll spray the oven, let it set, and then come back to wipe it clean and leave everything tidy.\n\nFlat rate: (whatever you want to charge)\nUsually takes 30–45 minutes\nLocal + flexible scheduling\n\nIf your oven needs some love before the holiday rush, reach out and I’ll get you on the schedule!",

I tried doing this with headlight restoration, but the issue is that all the cars with foggy headlights are street Parked and I'd have no idea how to contact the owner to get it restored. And most cars parked in the driveway had the cleanest headlights I've ever seen. And truthfully, my results have always been a bit of a mixed bag.\n\nSo I'm looking for another side hustle I can do where customer acquisition is very easy. I don't mind if a service is cheap like $10-30 per service if there are plentiful customers. I wanna know that if I go door to door almost everyone is a potential customer. I wanna be able to start tomorrow and have made back the investment by the end of the day almost guaranteed.\n\nLastly, I only have $50-$100 to invest in this. So anything I can start in that range would be perfect.",

      "selftext": "This is a continuation of one of my posts from about 5 months ago which began like this: \n\n\"So I began looking for ways to earn extra income during my long breaks at work. Here's the journey so far:\n\n1. Online Surveys – I made a few dollars, but quickly realized it wasn’t worth the time or effort.\n2. Bank Churning – I learned how to take advantage of sign-up bonuses and made a few thousand dollars. However, it wasn’t sustainable since offers can take over a year to become available again.\n3. Social Casinos – I discovered sweepstakes-based casino sites and started logging into 20+ of them daily, mostly playing blackjack. This earned me around $500/month.\n4. AMOE (Mail-In Entries) – I learned that I could send physical envelopes to social casinos to receive free Sweeps Coins. I created a system to streamline the writing process. I made around $10,000 in the first year and have made about $14,000 so far this year.\n5. Researched Amazon Dropshipping, retail arbitrage, FBA/FBM. Looked into creating my own products to sell. Created an Amazon merchant account. Bought shipping supplies. In the end, things didn't pan out.\n6. AI Content Creation – I learned how to generate AI models using Stable Diffusion, including NSFW images and videos through platforms like Civitai. I launched an Instagram page featuring sexy AI models and paid $25 to gain \\~700 followers (mostly fake or inactive). I also started a Fanvue page for NSFW content. I got 1 subscriber at $9.99/month, but they canceled within the first month. Since then, my follower count has dropped to around 530, and I currently have no subscribers.\n7. Niche Instagram Account – About a week ago, I created a new Instagram page focused on a specific niche I saw performing well. The first few days were slow with zero views, but then one video went semi-viral, which boosted the rest of my content. In the past 8 days, I’ve grown from 0 to over 1,200 followers, gaining 100+ per day. My current view range is 6k (yesterday's post) – 129k (semi-viral video from about 5 days ago).\n\nNext Steps\n\n8. Fanvue (Round 2) – I plan to launch a second Fanvue page with NSFW content once this new Instagram account hits 10,000 followers (hopefully within a month). I'm also researching Instagram monetization options based on view count.\n\n9. TikTok Expansion – I’ll be repurposing my content for TikTok and exploring monetization through the Creator Fund or other methods.\n\n10. YouTube Strategy – I plan to expand to YouTube. While YouTube Shorts don’t pay much even with high views, I’m considering ways to transition into longer-form content that can generate ad revenue and improve profitability.\n\nI feel extremely lucky to have succeeded with my 2nd Instagram account so quickly while others have struggled, including me. The point is to not give up, research, learn new tools, figure out what works, what doesn't, and try again.\n\nThanks for reading.\"\n\nSo that was 5+ months ago. Where am I now?\n\n1. My biggest and best money-maker (made \\~$30k?), social casinos, are being banned in many states, including mine, so now the process of using pen plotters to automate the writing process is useless. (Now, don't ask me how I'm doing this unless you're willing to pay me or buy 1 or more of my pen plotters which are collecting dust. I paid about $400/plotter, I have 4. I'll sell for $200)\n\n2. I had 2 instagram accounts, one focused on sexy asians in skimpy bikinis while the other was more western-girls focused. The niche Instagram account I mentioned earlier is focused on muscly girls in skimpy bikinis. The asian girl account wasn't performing well so I decided to close that account and combine asians and all other girls into my main niche account. The viral video I mentioned before is now at 2.1 million views. I have about 19k followers on my Instagram account, about 3k on my Tiktok account, and 4 followers on my new Facebook account. All this in about 5 months.\n\nMAKING MONEY ON SOCIAL MEDIA \n\nI think at about 5k followers on Instagram, the subscriber feature becomes available which allows followers to subscribe for exclusive content. I charge 4.99 and have 30 subscribers. Only 8 of them are paying and the rest are on a free 7 day trial so the numbers fluctuate.\n\nHowever, my plan was to redirect traffic with links to adult sites and charge a subscription. I ran into trouble with Fanvue after they decided my AI girls looked too young and banned me and threated legal action if I made a new account...great. Then I created an account on Fansly and gained some subscribers there but got banned again because apparently all models, whether real or AI, need real identification. I didn't give up and looked for others. Patreon? No realistic porn allowed. I settled on Dfans where I now reside. \n\nI wasn't sure how to advertise my Dfans on Instagram besides posting the link in my bio. Oh, I realized you're not allowed to directly link an adult site from instagram so I used a site called beacons(dot)ai which is safe for Instagram and allows me to link other sites. I use it for Tiktok as well. On Instagram, I mention my beacons link often in my videos, either through the description or on texts overlayed on videos. I've been aggressively promoting my Beacons (Dfans) link for about a month now. I sit at 17 subscribers on Dfans @ 9.99/subscriber. Dfans takes 20%. I'm disappointed that I only have 17 subs with nearly 19k followers on Instagram and 3k on Tiktok. ChatGPT said that 1% of followers subscribing is reasonable. So I should have at least 190 subs = $1,900/month before Dfans takes 20%. Tiktok is horrible for my type of content because 90% of my bikini girl videos either gets removed or restricted for content violations. I appeal and get most of my videos restored but I racked up a couple of strikes and am in danger of being banned on the platform. \n\nI also posted my content on Youtube Shorts and within a month or two, my channel got banned for whatever reason.\n\nI'm now posting on Facebook and within a month I have like 4 followers. Be patient.\n\nI uploaded some NSFW content on my other account and a Redditor messaged me asking for custom content. I made like $600 in a month from him. \n\nAnother redditor asked me to create ads for them after I uploaded a short film. \n\nLEVERAGING AI SKILLS\n\nNow that I'm pretty skilled with AI image/video generation. I decided to create a Youtube channel focused on study/relaxing music with cinematic AI videos. I repurposed my dormant Youtube channel from like 15+ years ago which had 2.8k subscribers. I barely have any views but I'm hoping to upload a 1-2 hour video every 1-2 weeks so hopefully the algorithm will notice me.\n\nEtsy. I decided to open an Etsy store with my AI art. I picked a niche and went for it. I knew I wanted to create different kinds of artwork so I chose a generic name for my shop. I used artwork from a book that was popular when I was young and colorized it for Halloween. So far, I made about $150 in about 1.5 months. ChatGPT helped with SEO when naming products, tagging, and description. Copywritten work? Yes, but others on Etsy were selling it so I said, what the hell, I'll take it down if they tell me.\n\nI have a subscription to Suno for music, ComfyUI for NSFW image/video gen, OpenArt for my AI image/video generations, Midjourney for inspiration and image gen, and ChatGPT for prompting and ideas.\n\nWhat now?\n\nKeep improving and being persistent. Persistence and consistency is key. I could have given up many times along the way but I'm stubborn and want to succeed. I used to play a lot of video games and now I treat this as a real life game that has real world benefits. I invest money into the tools that are going to help me succeed and work hard for the payout.\n\nWhy are you giving away your secrets?\n\nI don't know if it's a secret but this path is a difficult one. I'm documenting this here because I want to know how far I've come in another 5+ months. Another reason is because I know that 99.9% of the people that read this don't have it in them to hustle and grind. I realized this when I was writing my social casino postcards. I told people around me to do it because it's free money but 0% did it because it required work.\n\nTo the .1%, keep grinding.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Both through blog and social media affiliate marketing. Here's the ones I'm bullish on for 2026 and why. Also, I am not affiliated with any of them because I'm now out of the game (still make a few thousand a month) running a 7 figure social agency, but still find this stuff super interesting:\n-Booking.com: Seriously. Reason being: big % payout AND it's applicable to anyone. Easy approval too. You can see how this could work -- next time your friend is booking a vacation, just send them your link. Hand-to-hand combat like this can yield pretty decent payouts. \n-Otterly AI: Any of the LLM visibility tools are great as affiliate partners today. Every company wants to see how they appear in ChatGPT for generative engine optimization. The tools are new, conversion rates are relatively high, and ATV is really, really high (~$10k+ per year). Ranking for the search terms in Google is still possible because it's an emerging space. \n-Vista Social: I'm very bullish on channel/affiliate program alignment. This is what I mean: if you have a big presence on social (say Instagram), it's easy to promote tools that operate for that channel. That makes tools like Vista Social powerful affiliates. Highest conversion window in that space + 20% recurring commission. \n-Canva: Same deal. Very good channel/affiliate alignment. If you're on any visual channel with clout -- Insta, TikTok, Pinterest, etc. You can sell Canva -- it's universal to those users. \n-Sofi: So many use cases, 4-figure bounties on some products. No rule against retargeting ads, which can work quite well. \n-ChartPrime: Easy sell with many use cases. 30% commission and an AOV over $400. \n\nWhat others?",

      "selftext": " I really think the real opportunity is not “new AI models” but clear systems. Most people do not want a single magic prompt. They want a working AI workflow, step by step instructions and ready to use prompt packs that save time and help them make money. Most users are not experts. They get stuck because they do not know what to type or they waste hours tweaking prompts and still do not get stable results. If you can build something that works and explain it in plain language, that is already a product.\n\nI have been testing this with small digital products. One example is an image prompt guide for Etsy sellers, where I break down how to describe style, batch create images and write listings, then sell it as a short guide plus prompt pack. Another is a workflow for commercial videos. I teach how to write the product script, then show how to plug it into MovieFlow with a commercial template to get a full AI video draft, and finally do light edits in a normal editor. In both cases the value is the workflow itself, not just a list of prompts.\n\nThere is no ready template for this. You build from zero, run many tests, and then clean everything up into something other people can follow. That part takes time, but once it is done the product turns into a long term asset that can keep selling in the background. As someone selling digital products I am still surprised how many people want this kind of thing and have no idea where to start. Demand for good workflows is much bigger than the number of people willing to sit down and really build them.",

      "selftext": "When AI image generators came out, I noticed something dumb but kinda obvious:  \na lot of restaurants have really bad photos in food delivery apps.  \nWeird angles, ugly lighting, random backgrounds… just stuff that makes the food look worse than it probably is.\n\nAnd I figured—if a photo looks bad, people probably scroll past.  \nRestaurants survive based on how many orders they get. If better pics could help them catch even *some* of those lost customers, maybe they'd pay for that.\n\nBefore you call it a “shitty idea,” remember this: restaurant owners who’ve run their business for years don’t buy anything that would mislead their customers. They bought because the quality matched what they actually serve.\n\nMy goal wasn’t to make cheap-looking AI pics. I recreated the dish exactly how it’s served, just styled and lit properly, like it would be in a pro studio shoot.\n\nSo I made a list of places with awful-looking menus.  \nThen I used ChatGPT’s image tool to generate nicer versions—pro-style, appetizing, clean backgrounds. No camera. No food. Just AI prompts.\n\nI emailed each business with two free sample images based on their menu.  \nSuper simple message. No pitch. Just:  \n“Hey, I tried reimagining your dishes like this.”\n\nSome ignored it.  \nSome replied.  \nAnd a few asked for a full set of menu pics.\n\nI wasn’t charging much - around €150 per client, but after a while I was making around €1K/month, just working with businesses in my area.\n\nZero experience. No portfolio. Just an idea, free tools, and a bit of time.\n\nIf you’re broke or starting from scratch, this might be worth trying. It’s super easy to do and doesn’t take much time at all.",

Same 30-second result, but it's their real dish looking professional.\n\nWhy enhancement beats generation for this business:\n\n1. Way easier to sell - Restaurant owners trust it more (no fake food concerns)\n2. No customer backlash - Customers get exactly what they see, just styled better\n3. Fully automated - No spending hours on ChatGPT prompts per restaurant\n\nFor anyone wanting to replicate OP's success: The opportunity is 100% real. Use MenuPhotoAI to handle the tech, you handle sales and client relationships. Same hustle, better product, none of the ethical drama.

          "body": "I've been making a couple hundred each month just by looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than the cost. It's called bonus arbitrage. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

But honestly, POD has been one of the easiest and most consistent income sources for me. If you create just a handful of strong, trend-aligned designs, those alone can bring in thousands over time. I have two simple sticker designs that sell for me every single week, and just last month one of them brought in over $50 on its own on Zazzle.

Most people think dropshipping means Shopify, ads, and spending money, but eBay already has built-in traffic. With tools like AutoDS the process is mostly automated. It’s beginner friendly and doesn’t require big upfront costs.\n\nAnother underrated one is doing **s**hort marketing videos for small businesses. Every business needs content for Instagram and TikTok, but most don’t know how to make it or don’t have time. You can create these videos using stock footage, simple templates, and AI voice tools. The hardest part used to be the voiceover, but that is solved easily now with modern tools. A few local clients paying for monthly content bundles can become steady income.\n\nBoth of these are quiet, low competition, and way more profitable than the apps and trends people usually recommend.\n\nI write about all these methods in my blog post.

Started making my own google sheets for tenant tracking, maintenance schedules, all that boring stuff. Made them way more automated with formulas and conditional formatting.\n\nMy coworker saw them and asked if she could buy one off me. I was like sure, 15 bucks whatever. Then she told her friend who manages a small apartment complex, and that person bought too.\n\nThat got me thinking so I cleaned them up, made them more universal, and listed them on etsy back in june. Didn't expect much honestly since its such a specific thing. But property managers and small landlords kept finding them. I guess there's not a ton of options out there that aren't either too basic or overly complicated.\n\nNow I'm averaging like $400 a month from it. Some months are $300, had one month hit almost $600. I spend maybe an hour a week answering questions or doing small updates when someone requests a feature. The money just hits my account and its pretty nice.\n\nI've got some money saved up now and I genuinely don't know how to scale this thing. Like do I hire someone to make more templates? Start advertising? Expand to other platforms? I'm kinda stuck because this whole thing happened by accident and I dont really have a business background. I'm not even good at marketing. I just wrote decent descriptions, used the right keywords, and let etsy do its thing. Thinking about making templates for other industries now but haven't decided which one yet.",

      "selftext": "Lost my retail job in April. They cut hours then just let me go. Unemployment was $280/week which barely covered anything. Rent is $1100.\n\nTried applying to other retail jobs but everything was part time or minimum wage. Decided to figure out how to make money online instead.\n\nStarted an Instagram page about budget meal prep in May. Thought it would be easy. Posted random recipes and tips. Got maybe 30 likes per post. Grew to 800 followers in 2 months and made $0.\n\nTried to monetize too early. Put affiliate links everywhere. Nobody clicked. Page looked desperate.\n\nStopped posting for 3 weeks in July because I thought it was pointless. Then randomly posted a video about making meals for under $3. It got 35k views. Went from 800 followers to 4200 in a week.\n\nStarted posting more consistently after that. Had a few more videos hit 10k to 20k views over the next couple months. Growth slowed down but kept going.\n\nBrands started reaching out in August. First deal was $150 for 3 posts about meal planning containers. Thought it was a scam but they paid.\n\nMade $340 in September from brand deals and Amazon affiliate links. Made $680 in October. Made $900 in November.\n\nAlso started doing social media management for local businesses in September. Found my first client by DMing a coffee shop that had 400 followers and hadn't posted in 2 months. Offered to run their Instagram for $200/month.\n\nGot a second client in October, a nail salon for $250/month. Then a third one in November, a small gym for $200/month. That's $650/month from freelance work.\n\nTotal in November was $1550. First time I've covered rent and groceries without panicking.\n\nInstagram page is at 9k followers now. I try to post daily but realistically it's more like 4-5 times a week. Mostly short videos about cheap meals and grocery shopping tips.\n\nSocial media work takes about 6 hours a week total. Create posts for all 3 clients, schedule them, reply to comments. Pretty easy once you have a system.\n\nStill not stable though. Instagram income varies a lot. Some months brands reach out, some months nothing. Freelance clients could drop me anytime.\n\nBut it's better than retail. At least I control my time.\n\nTime investment is maybe 15-20 hours a week across everything. Costs are around $35/month for scheduling tools and some other stuff.\n\nBiggest thing I learned is you can't force it. That one video that blew up wasn't better than my other content. Just got lucky with timing. Now I post consistently and hope something hits.\n\nHow do you guys find brands to work with besides just waiting around?",

The page flip thing makes people take it more seriously too, and being able to track opens is super helpful for figuring out if the interest is real or just “oh neat” clicks.\n\nThe email capture part is tricky though.

          "body": "I've been making a couple hundred each month just by looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than the cost. It's called bonus arbitrage. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

      "selftext": "Lately I have been reading this sub a lot and watching people around me. A few people I know say they make around 20k a month using AI to create influencer style photos and short videos. It is not just posting random AI art any more. They build a full AI influencer brand around one character and keep a steady flow of posts across platforms.\n\nWhat I see now is that AI is turning into a way to produce content at scale. For images people keep talking about tools like Modelsify, Midjourney and Lumalabs to lock in the look and style. For video some people write a real script first, then use something like MovieFlow to turn that script into a longer story video, and later cut it into vertical shorts for each platform. It feels more like a small content studio than a one off AI experiment.\n\nI am still just watching and learning, nowhere near that income level, but the demand seems real. As a viewer you are following a character and an ongoing story, not just random posts. As a creator, once the character and accounts are set up, the work is more about keeping a pace and posting rhythm, which starts to look a bit like semi passive income. I am not greedy. If I could make an extra 200 dollars a month from something like this I would already be happy.\n\nSo I wanted to ask people here who are actually doing this. When you use AI for content as a side project, how do you build the image pipeline and keep the video look stable over time Are there tool combinations you trust for long term work For example where do you still rely on classic editing and where do you let a long form AI video tool like MovieFlow handle the first version And in real life, how passive does it feel once the system is running",

The editing is what’s going to take the most amount of time.  \n\nAs far as passive vs active, it’s going to be all active until you have a lot of flowers and all those $10-75/month posts bring more views and more income.  So you have close to 100 of $10-75 revenue stream equivalent to $1000-7500/ month.  All speculation though.  ",

Now anyone can shoot a movie on an iPhone and laptop. \n\nThe process of creating good content in the same, the script must be amazing, and the basic steps are the same. But the technology continues to improve, get faster, easier to use and access, cheaper to produce, etc…\n\nIf Ai pans out, we will be saying, “We use to have to go out and hire an actor, get insurance, and pay tons of money to get this shot of Tom C (who’s now dead) jumping out of this boat at high speed - now we just prompt this laptop.”",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche and you can build it up over time.\n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote.

Online sportsbooks spend a ridiculous amount on new-user acquisition, and the promos they give out are often worth more than the tiny hit you take converting them. So you might get a $100 bonus bet and realistically cash out around $70–$90 of that within a few minutes.

It's a form of arbitrage, and it can make you an extra couple hundred each month. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives those offers higher, creating more opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how it works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them.

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/is-the-wealthy-affiliate-black-friday-deal-worth-it-heres-whats-included-november-28-december-1/",

I just feel that if I could make an extra 1–2k a month, life would feel a lot less tight. The problem is when I search online, everything is “passive income guide” and it just makes me more confused.\n\nRecently I have been trying random ideas. Some people say start a faceless video channel. Some say write templates and sell them. Others say open a small online store and sell a few very niche products. Tools are also everywhere now. I can use Canva for visuals, chat tools for copy, and for the website part I could use something like genstore to spin up a basic store and then tweak the details myself. On paper it all sounds possible, but in reality I only have one or two hours a day and I am scared to pick the wrong thing.\n\nSo I wanted to ask people here with real experience. If you were in my position with a bit of starting money and limited time each day, what would you focus on first. Would you launch the simplest small site that can take payments and see if it brings in a little steady cash, or spend a long time building one skill until you can take on clients. Also curious which small projects looked good at first but turned out to be really bad for beginners.",

          "body": "Passive investing for the most part is a scam, first of all everything you listed isn't even passive it's just creating your own business that you have to do manually. The only real consistent passive investment is stocks bonds and real estate (and real estate is very rarely passive unless you're incredibly rich). If you want more money a better use of your time would be: 1. Try find a partner, not only will you be happier but you'll double your salary immediately, two people working is essentially a must in this economy if you're poor. 2. Spend time upskilling, it's very rare that a passive investment will make you 12k a month without requiring lots of money to start it, but you can easily achieve a 12k increase in salary by upskilling (you can actually get much more than 12k increase in salary). So yes, those are my recommendations.",

You need a steady loop of users, updates, and a monetization plan like ads, cosmetic IAPs, or subscriptions, and even then most games don’t break out. Try a tiny prototype first, ship it fast, and see if anyone comes back in a week, then iterate. For a more stable income while you learn, I sometimes watch for remote roles in support or admin, wfhalert emails verified remote jobs and it’s been a low noise way to find legit work between projects.",

But here is the secret: Don't spend it on \"looking rich.\" Take that cash and feed it into boring, reliable dividend assets (the \"Monsters\").\nIt feels slow today. But if you start the \"Owner\" mindset at 19, the compound interest does the heavy lifting for you. You win by being boring, not by being flashy.\nHang in there. 19 is tough, but you're asking the right questions.",

It’s all about finding a part of the market that’s in demand but eBay sellers aren’t honed in on.\n\nOr you can do research to see what sellers are selling the most of and try to compete with them. The secret that no one gets is that convenience is a very big part of this business. There are many people out there who don’t care about finding the best deals out of 20 different websites. They will use Amazon and eBay and that’s it. So find something outside of those two sites  that isn’t being sold much on eBay and list them. I had a thought about using wholesale stores to sell things like pet food in larger quantities than other stores provide. Toilet paper, etc. That’s dropship reselling. When you list an item and it gets bought on eBay, you order it from Costco, or Walmart (or whatever) and ship it to their house. Provide the tracking numbers on eBay and then you get paid after a grace period. Don’t start with big items because eBay will hold the payout on the first few orders you get until they are delivered and eBay ensures you’re not scamming people. Then once you sell about 10-15 items and they are successfully delivered, then eBay will be more forthcoming with the payouts. You get up to 200 listings before eBay will charge you for listing items. \n\nI plan on starting this kind of side-hustle very soon so if I remember I will check back in after a month with progress report.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/is-the-wealthy-affiliate-black-friday-deal-worth-it-heres-whats-included-november-28-december-1/",

      "selftext": "I started building side projects a little over a year ago.\n\nSome of them got a few users, but they never made money. I kept running into the same issue: I was building without knowing if people actually wanted what I was making.\n\nMy latest project is different :)\n\nI launched [my project](https://bigideasdb.com/) 7 months ago, and it made $18,000 in revenue within that time. My most successful product by far.\n\nHere's what I did differently this time:\n\n**1. Building a habit of collecting problems**\n\nI created a habit of constantly writing down problems and pain points, whether it was something I personally experienced or something I saw others struggle with online.\n\nI use a simple notes system on my phone and just add problems whenever something clicks.\n\nWhen it came time to build a new project, I had dozens of validated problems to choose from. Most weren't great, but a few stood out. BigIdeasDB was one of them.\n\n**2. Validating before building anything**\n\nThis was the biggest difference-maker.\n\nInstead of immediately building the product, I spent time figuring out if it was something others would actually pay for.\n\nI shared the idea on Reddit and Twitter, reached out to founders, and asked questions like:\n\n* Do you struggle to find good product ideas?\n* Would you use a database of validated problems scraped from real sources like Reddit, G2, and Upwork?\n* How much would you pay for something like this?\n\nThe responses were overwhelmingly positive. That gave me the confidence to move forward.\n\n**3. Listening to users religiously**\n\nOnce I launched the MVP, I stayed close to my users. I asked them:\n\n* What's missing from the platform?\n* What would help you find better problems to solve?\n* What features would make you upgrade?\n\nThis approach made it so much easier to know what to build next. I didn't waste time guessing, I just built what users asked for.\n\n**4. Obsessing over metrics**\n\nI started tracking everything: website conversion rates, user activation behavior, and upgrade funnels.\n\nI could see exactly:\n\n* How many visitors converted to users\n* How many of those became paying customers\n* What actions made people more likely to convert\n\nFor example, my landing page was only converting at around 4% early on. I focused on improving that, and after testing different headlines and features, I got it to 9%, which directly doubled my revenue.\n\n**5. Focusing on real problems with buying intent**\n\nInstead of just collecting random complaints, I focused on problems where people were already spending money or actively looking for solutions.\n\nG2 reviews showed me what paying customers hated about existing tools. Upwork job listings revealed what companies were struggling to hire help for. Reddit posts highlighted frustrations people were venting about daily.\n\nThese weren't just problems, they were validated market opportunities.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nI had to fail multiple times before I figured out how to build something people actually wanted.\n\nThe biggest change this time was validating the idea early, but combining that with real user feedback, clear metrics, and focusing on problems with proven buying intent made everything easier.\n\nIf you're still trying to get your first win, don't give up. Build small, talk to users, and make sure you're solving something real that people are already paying to fix.",

I started an instagram last summer (2024) talking about how much energy healing and yoga helped me feel calmer and more at ease in motherhood. I got a lot of traction form that and some podcast episode invites etc, started taking it a bit more serious a few months later and launched a small membership site. It was originally just yoga and meditation sessions moms could do quickly in between nap times, diapers etc., but evolved quickly after winning some outside funding  that I applied for thinking there was no shot. About 16 months from starting my silly little insta page I’m now taking my little side business even more seriously, launching a full blown alternative spiritual wellness platform made for moms of babies and young children. Hired my first 2 contractors and we pulled in about 25k this year. I am very limited w how much I work since I’m a stay at home mom otherwise so I’m only putting in like 2 - 3 hours a week on this max, even at this more “serious” stage. People make fun of passive income streams like this by saying “it’s not really passive!!” But 25k a year to only work 3 hours a week with growth every single month has been pretty solid for me and my family. Not to mention summers completely off with contractors running almost everything and growth projections surpassing 6 figures in only like 18m -24m. It’s not hard to do this stuff tbh just find the right niche, listen to whatever people’s problems are, build a strong community culture, and don’t give up. Thanks for this post bc I literally never know in context how I’m doing or if my business is even a side project or how to even talk about it. I appreciate your honesty and you taking the time to communicate what has worked for you!",

Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them.

          "body": "You can try bonus arbitrage, which can probably make you a couple hundred each month. Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

I live in Ontario, Canada, and I’ve been trying to find a legit online/remote job for a while now. One of the biggest barriers I keep running into is that a lot of Canadian remote positions want bilingual English/French speakers — and I only speak English.\n\nMy situation is a bit urgent. I have MS, and my mobility isn’t great, so remote work is really the only realistic option for me right now. I’ve been waiting a long time for ODSP, and I need to find something soon just to stay afloat.\n\nIf anyone here has tips on:\n• Where to apply for English-only remote jobs\n• Companies that hire Canadians for fully remote work\n• Sites or communities that are actually legit (not scams)\n• Roles that don’t require a ton of physical activity or being on the phone all day\n• Any personal experiences with finding remote work in Ontario\n\n…I would be super grateful.\n\nI have customer service, admin, and leadership experience — I just need to find a chance somewhere.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to help. I really appreciate it.",

So, Upwork itself is legit, they are not scamming you in any way, and all of their fees are well documented and laid out in their terms which you agree to when you make an account. But, yeah, at the same time, it's absolutely swarming with both scammers posing to hire and scammers posing to offer work, so both sides.\n\nThe reasoning there is scammers prey on desperation, since your ability to reason and think logically is diminished as you succumb to desperation. And that's on both sides, folks desperately looking for cheap labor since they can't afford professional services and need to get work done, as well as folks desperately looking for work, like yourself. A vast marketplace rife with desperation is always going to be a huge target for scammers. And that's also the logic behind it being pay-to-play, since scammers generally just want to scam you in order to get money without shelling out even so much as a penny in the process. So, being pay-to-play reduces the effectiveness of many scammers, but it doesn't actually eliminate the problem.",

You don’t have to subscribe, but if you plan to apply to more than a few gigs a week, they basically push you toward paying for extra Connects. It’s annoying, especially when you’re brand new and not even guaranteed to land a job yet.\n\nThe platform is real, but the early stage feels like you’re burning money just to try to earn money.\n\nIf you’re still exploring online options, you might want to pair Upwork with something that doesn’t cost anything upfront. I’ve been messing with DropWork + ClubChain recently (their full launch is in January), and they’re running free tasks on Zealy right now no subscription, no bidding, just small quests you do on your own time. They even added a 1,000 USDT mini-game, so at least you can earn something while figuring out Upwork.\n\nSo yeah, Upwork is legit, but it’s expensive at the beginning.

So, I wrote about the pain points, my audience had, gave a partial solution that they could get relief with then linked to the full solution.\n\nIt converted to sales.\n\nThe post didn't even go viral. It got around 20K views or so in the past month. This is from one post only.\n\nThat's it.\n\nI plan on trying it again, maybe targeting a different niche to see if I get different or better results.\n\nI think the key takeaway is that Reddit marketing can be done successfully. I love Reddit for how raw and real conversations here are.\n\nI don't want to water that down with marketing but, companies are already doing it. I think if you can balance helpful, value-packed content with driving business to your brand or offer, it can be a win-win.\n\n**What do you think?**\n\n**Have you tried this?**",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone.  \nI am not much of a Redditor, but I'm struggling now and decided to ask/share here to get tome thoughts and insights, maybe.\n\nA few months ago, I lost my job and just then talking to my friend I learnt the details of her work which is link building. I did some reading and found the concept of SEO very intriguing, as it is basically you trying to figure out the rules by which Google plays and then succeed at the game (at least how I see it so far). The organic aspect of it seems very interesting to me.\n\nI must say I am from a small country where SEO is not very developed, but we have some local SEO agencies and companies that have SEO departments, both of which accept interns regularly. So I decided to give it my time and attention and learn at least the basics and try to get into the field.\n\nThe basics of SEO were pretty easy to understand. My friend introduced me to everything (big thanks to her!) and I even started helping her (unofficially) with her job a bit to get some hands-on experience in email outreach. We managed to build something around 10 links in a month with my help, and I am very proud of that, honestly.\n\nRecently I have also completed a fill SEO course which was very easy to follow and understand. It felt somewhat reassuring, seeing stuff I already knew from what my friend had taught me included in the course. I am now waiting to see the results of my final exam on it.\n\nStarting from the last week, I have also been accepted for an internship. They gave the applicants an initial task, and apparently I did it well enough that I passed. Now, this is an internship for a link building position, and we're starting from the basics, but I can't wait to start doing more practical work.\n\nAll of this being said, I want to share that even though I have been saying that stuff feels easy to understand, it also feels very overwhelming. Every single little thing/term/tactic seems to lead to a bunch more new and complex to remember things. Having no real work experience, it is very hard for me to make sense of what is actually a commonplace thing to do and what is very situational and possibly even outdated.\n\nI try my best to listen to beginner-friendly podcasts and whatnot to get some sense of trust in my own knowledge and understanding of things. Most of the time, having no paid tools to use or having no actual work experience/environment with the theory/practice ratio being something like 90/10 it feels so overwhelming and too much at times to grasp.\n\nI would love to hear how you all started your journeys. Is it okay to feel this way? Am I overthinking it, and once/if I get a proper job in the field it will get easier with more experience? I think there are a lot of us newcomers here, and I would love to hear from you too. Do you have similar stuff going on for you? How do you go about it?",

It was stressing him out and slowing him down. \n\n\n\nSo I decided to build him an chatbot. Nothing fancy  just something that could actually help him. And, it ended up working way better than I expected. It helped answer customer’s questions and provide recommendations for the menu considering the menu is pretty large. \n\n\n\nAfter doing this, here are the biggest things I learned:\n\n\n\n1. Have confidence in your skills.\n\n\n\nI didn’t even know if I could build a good chatbot until I actually tried it. Sometimes you don’t know you can do something until you actually try.\n\n\n\n2. Know the value you create.\n\n\n\nI realized the bot wasn’t just “answering questions.” It was giving my dad time back. Every minute the bot handled a question was a minute he didn’t have to leave the oven or stop prepping orders. Time saved is value.\n\n\n\n3. Think long term, not one-time.\n\n\n\nInstead of thinking, “let me just build this once,” I realized how useful it would be to refine it over time, improving responses, adding new features, updating menu items, logging common questions, etc. \n\n  \n\n\n4. Learn from others\n\n\n\nMaking a chatbot that actually works is hard. I watched tutorials, learned from devs, etc. That saved me from so much time. There’s always someone who already solved the problem you’re facing.\n\n\n\nYou can build a lot of useful things with agents and chatbots, even for small businesses like my dad’s.\n\n",

They operate with almost no visibility in the tech world, yet they’ve become one of Elon Musk’s biggest financial backers.\n\nWhat shocked me first was how small they are.\n\nVy runs with only four core investors and roughly twenty people across California, London and Dubai. Even with a team that small, they **manage around fifteen billion dollars and have delivered about twenty-eight per cent annual returns for ten years.**\n\nThe second surprising thing is how concentrated they are. Instead of spraying money across dozens of startups, they built their entire identity around backing Musk early and sticking with him for the long haul.\n\nSome of their biggest moves include:\n\n* Investing in SpaceX when it was valued at $15B (it’s now close to $400B)\n* Putting $700M into the Twitter acquisition\n* Taking large positions in Neuralink and xAI\n\nThere are estimates that more than half of Vy’s portfolio is now tied to companies Musk runs.\n\nThe final thing that stood out is how they think about building a firm. They aren’t trying to scale into a giant institution. They actually told their LPs recently that they won’t raise outside money anymore. After compounding billions, they want to invest their own capital instead, which is extremely rare in venture.\n\nAnd they’re not only focused on the US. They backed companies like Zomato and Urban Company in India, along with firms like Upgrade, Cerebras and Coalition.\n\nWhen you put it all together, Vy feels less like a traditional VC fund and more like a tight, high-trust investment group built around long-term conviction instead of chasing trends. Small team, deep focus, long holding periods and quiet execution.\n\nPretty unusual in today’s tech investment world.",

          "body": "Totally get this-finding a trustworthy web designer is way harder than it sounds! In the early days, I wrestled with the same “do it myself” vs “hire someone” dilemma. Honestly, if you’re just getting established, a simple site built on platforms like Squarespace or Wix (customized by you) often does the trick and gives you control at the start.\n\nIf you do hire, check for real client portfolios, read through detailed testimonials (not just star ratings), and ask for a quick call before committing. Freelance platforms like Upwork or local Facebook groups often surface solid folks with verifiable work. Recommendation: pick someone who communicates clearly-good designers explain the process and set expectations, not just drop a price.\n\nGetting it right isn’t just about the design, but finding someone who “gets” your brand and your goals. Good luck with your photography hustle-your work will look even more pro with the right site!",

I thought building my own site would be faster and cheaper, but I ended up burning weeks tweaking layouts, second guessing every section, and still feeling like the site didn’t match the level of my work. What finally pushed me to hire someone was realizing that my time was better spent shooting and getting clients, not learning web design from scratch.\n\nWhat actually helped me choose a designer wasn’t reviews but portfolio relevance. A designer who had already built sites for photographers understood things I never thought about gallery loading speed, how to structure project pages, how to highlight style instead of cluttering things with text, how clients navigate. I basically picked someone who had solved problems I didn’t even know existed.\n\nIf you want a simple filter to choose someone, look for three things: Portfolio that matches your industry or aesthetic. Clear pricing and clear scope no vague custom quote traps. Someone who explains their choices instead of just asking what do you want.\n\nAlso, do one paid small project first a landing page or a single portfolio layout before committing to a full site. It tells you everything about communication, quality, and whether they actually get your brand. Hope this helps you!",

It's true that persistence is undervalued.  \n  \nI'm curious: now that you've reached this milestone, which feels more difficult: reaching $1 million or determining what comes next?  \n  \nAdditionally, really, give yourself a treat.

Now that you've found success through digital product selling, have you started doing instagram/shortform/newsletters, or is all of that revenue coming from reddit alone?",

Yes there are a lot of \"lipstick on a pig\" solutions that aren't that effective for tangible results.  We mainly see that with 19 year olds on social media flaunting rented Lambos.  However, you said it yourself OP, as long as it yields a return, who cares if it's AI?  In my experience, we keep our solutions simple and focused on mainly revenue generating activities.  AI isn't going anywhere but I'll agree that the bubble has a MAX of 2 years before it pops for sure.

      "selftext": "About a month ago, I got a ride from a bright and starry-eyed 20s-something who had just moved to my city. He left his family behind, some 1,500 miles away - said he wanted to make it and seek out opportunity.\n\nWe got to chatting, told him a bit of my backstory selling across FAANG, some startups, and now being a founder. Turns out he has a background in sales and is hungry for knowledge + experience. I've been wanting to mentor a seller since I never had one myself (apart from the books I read), and this is the first time someone has actually taken me up on the offer. It's crazy considering how many people say they want to make it but don't take any initiative.\n\nI'm giving him a chance in hopes that grit and sheer determination outperform pedigree (we typically recruit from Ivy League and technical universities). I've always held the hypothesis that many people have the drive to better their lives, but not everyone has the opportunity. Now we get to test it. Anecdotally there seem to be three core elements to success in entry-level B2B; the \"Want\"; the intelligence filter; and the execution filter.\n\nI've hired him on as a BDR on a 6 month contract. By my calculations, if he's even 60% as good as I am at setting appointments, both the company and he will have positive financial outcomes.\n\nI look forward to updating the group as this progresses, and I hope this serves as a gentle reminder to take a chance on the underdog.\n\nHappy U.S. Thanksgiving to those that observe.",

More recently I got into real estate development, focusing on outdoor alternative assets. I was even designing an RV park at one point.\n\nThen shit hit the fan when our family grew by one, and I had to pivot away from that venture. I’d been working with people who were way in over their heads and outside their skill sets; myself included.\n\nOut of that mess, I ended up getting hired as a VP at a company that’s now worth 9-figures, just a little over a year after relaunch. It’s easily on track to be a 10-figure company in the next three years or less. We’re building a game-changing application of solar technology for trailers and other mobile platforms.\n\nThe CEO first saw what I could do almost ten years ago, on my first day consulting for him, when I upgraded the technical capabilities of his flagship model; changing the way he tracked his fleet (still only one in the industry doing this to this day). When things went south with the RV venture, I called him. He told me he had big things coming if I could wait it out.\n\nI did. It was brutal.\n\nBut now I’m here, developing software that’s going to help cement us as the leader in this space before we expand to other verticals. The world is our oyster at this point.\n\nSo yeah, having someone take a chance on you and proving them right is half the challenge. Proving it to yourself is the other half.",

Now he owns less than 15 percent, but the company is valued close to 170 million. So that makes his share worth about 25 million on paper.\n\nBut he is not even close to happy. Investors have all sorts of rights now. He says they went behind his back more than once. He feels like they kind of pushed him out.\n\nFrom what I can tell, investors decide who stays or goes on the management team. They skip all emotion and just say they trust the system, not him. Reading between the lines, it sounds like they want him out, but they are not buying his shares, so he cannot leave.\n\nHe is stuck inside a company he started. It honestly sounds brutal. Almost like he never really learned how venture works until it was too late.\n\nStories like this remind me why I am bootstrapping my own project. No outside pressure, no board calls, no one ready to pull the rug out. I get to actually enjoy what I am building, set my own pace, and keep control. Sometimes I wonder if more founders would choose this way if they heard about the real tradeoffs up front.\n\nP.S. For those who’ve asked me in DMs, my project is called IGScraping.",

I have barely enough for myself. \n\nI also teach my own student. They pay me 2-3x what I pay my own tutors. From the money I earn, I pay my rent, most basic necessities (phone, internet, gym), and everything else goes back into my business, so basically I am not earning anything from my business (I put more in than I get out) - even though I work pretty much all day every day (only had one day off since august)\n\nI also try to treat my tutors the best I can - I often ask them if there is anything they need, such as dealing with a bad student, stress, time management, or new features in our internal system, which I am also developing on my own.\n\nI can objectively say that I treat and compensate my tutors way better than they would be treated if they worked for our competitors. But I still have the feeling that I am exploiting them for my own profit (even though they make more money out of my business than I do)\n\nHas anyone experienced anything similar?

Three things I learned while running my own business that might help you:\n\n-\n1. You have to prioritise profit at some level; you need profit to invest in better software, staff, hardware, marketing, secure communication, data protection and on and on and on. Profit does not automatically equal exploitation. If you don't make money on top of your expenses you will not be able to grow efficiently, and efficient growth gives your employees more and improved resources, supports and non-monetary gains (gym memberships that are a tax write off for the business etc).\n\n\n2. Pay people to do things that they’re good at (this extends to software as well). Don’t waste your time being a bookkeeper with a spreadsheet when there is software or people that can do it quicker, cheaper and with their full focus. This applies to marketing, infrastructure, everything. At the start you have to do everything yourself but don’t make that period last any longer than it has to. \n\n\n3. You need to learn to look after yourself - you're current workload is unsustainable and will lead to health problems, and eventually burnout. I say this based on the fact I worked in a very similar way to you for most of my adult life (and doubly so for the 10 years I ran my business) until at 33 my brain and body decided enough was enough. I went from relatively healthy to now using a walker and being legally disabled. How will your staff be better off if you're not there. *Necessary disclaimer that my story isn’t your story, you are not me so what happened to me is indicative of what could happen to you - however there is plenty of evidence talking about the damage overworking does to our brain and body long term.*\n\n-\nYou're actually helping more than just your staff, you’re forcing your competitors to improve their conditions to retain good talent.

At least for me, it was like you want to earn something yourself, you put in a lot of hard work and sweat, so you feel like you are entitled to the composition. \n\nBut at some point, especially when you're successful and it's enough to lead a wealthy lifestyle it might feel as though for you it comes too easily, whereas your employees still have to work as hard as they did initially. The other thing is that you also had a higher risk in the beginning. So obviously now the reward comes with that risk. It's the flip side of it. And I'm guessing that your reward package is different from your employees because they have social security and other forms of compensation perhaps (holiday allowance, insurance, retirement, etc.) and even if there's less work, they're still being paid. And there's many other differences between employees and employers in terms of risks and reward.  \n  \nNot sure if it changes anything but at least for me realizing this sometimes helps to put things in perspective, even though I still recognize what you're describing.

I've always had a job ever since I was 14 and I made sure in every single one to do stuff that wasn't in my job description to gain experience...many times trying to get experience doing certain specific things so I could put it on my resume for the next job. \n\nThen, when I graduated high school I went to college and got a Bachelor's Degree, worked in b2b sales for a radio station for a year before going back to college to get a Master's Degree, which I graduated with when I was 24 and got an entry level job doing b2b sales with a part time bartending job on the side and started a freelance graphic design job in my spare time. \n\nThe b2b sales job was just a stop gap until I could find a Graphic Design job. Once I got the Graphic Design job, I job hopped every 2 or 3 years...Graphic Designer to Marketing Coordinator to Art Director to Creative Director to VP of Communications, which was a $100k per year gig. All the while, I always had extra income from my freelance business. \n\nAfter almost 4 years of the VP of Comms job, at the age of 36, I quit to try and do the freelance business full time...had 10-15 core clients...rebranded the business as a 'Creative Consultancy' and went very aggressive after new clients and hired a couple of talented young designers that worked for me in my previous role to work part time projects for me on the side while I sold and handled the client service side of the biz. \n\nYear 1&amp;2 I paid myself a $38k salary...luckily my wife had gotten a promotion at work from her $45k a year job to a $65k a year job, so we buckled down and made it work. Year 3 I hired my part timers on full time at $50k a year each and knocked my salary down to $30k a year. That year propelled us forward and I was able to give myself raises in Year 4 to $50k and Year 5 to $65k. The business was making money and I had enough retained earnings to stary another business with a business partner. \n\nI'm approaching Year 7 fully self employed as a 43 year old man with 2 businesses...my Creative Consultancy where I pay myself $120k and my other business where I pay myself $30k...and my wife, a 44 yo woman, is up to $75k a year. We make $225k as a household in the Midwest, own a $350k house with around $130k left on loan with 3 cars (all paid off) and a full time camping spot on a lake. We each still have $20k in student loans but I've got about $60k in high interest savings, $120k in a 401k, and 2 businesses that would sell for probably $500k and $200k respectively. \n\nI'm not rich but I live a very comfortable life that I would have never imagined growing up. I spent half my childhood in a trailer park, the other half in 3 different apartments before my parents bought a house in the rough part of town when I was a junior in high school. Both of them have passed away but they struggled with addiction their whole lives. \n\nMoral of my story is - stay curious, always be open to learning new skills and if the opportunity presents itself to start a business and go out on your own, go for it. My wife and I both spent a lot getting educated (we both have Master's Degrees) but it paid off and we have consistently moved up in our careers. \n\nMy biggest word of advice would be to stay patient. I was so eager to move up in my younger days and I got so frustrated when it didnt happen. I was 30 with a Masters Degree thinking I should be making $150k a year because I was smart and talented and I got passed up for opporunities because rich people's kids were more connected and they did it so effortlessly that it really pissed me off and I had a complex about that until I started my own business. I control my life now...and its great. I'm not rich but, from where I came from and with where I live, paying myself $150k a year aint half bad...and I'm still growing my businesses! By 50 I want to be making $300k - who knows if its possible but I'm doing everything I can to try and make it happen. \n\nHope that helps!",

If you can’t remember it after 10 minutes, don’t buy it. Etc. etc..\n2. People will pay to make their life easy if you are around a target that you want to hit find out how to make their lives easier. That is the way you become a billionaire.\n3. Rich is literally a state of mind. If you are not happy with what you have right now you’re not gonna be happy with more. I found this out the really really hard way. Make sure you’re right inside otherwise the money will just hide the crap even more And at the worst possible time the crap will show itself and the money will go away.\n\nThese three should get you started &amp; are good anchors. Your life will kind of dictate where to go once you find your wedge be very good at what you do so that they recommend you to everyone they know. \n\n\nThe thing with a lot of people who seem rich with the cars and stuff they’re not actually rich they just have access to the things that make them look rich. Most of them are cash poor. If you can build a decent nest egg of cash then you’ll be richer than probably 90% of the people out there .",

Tried various ideas to make money, but without starting with money and support realized it would probably be better to work a career and try again after getting more time and money. I found a job that I thought I'd enjoy and pay decently. You can use government data to search careers, incomes, and expected demand to find something that pays well and hopefully is growing. \n\nNow that I have a good paying job and kind of settled down I've been thinking of trying some additional ideas. I've also always been pretty good at managing and saving money and now have the time and money to start something, but even without that, based on my current savings and career path, I will reach all of my financial goals and am on track as well. Finances are a skill that can be learned, there are personal finance subs with how to do that.\n\nI suggest finding a way to earn income whether that is some formal education or something informal like through receiving mentorship through some work path. Or even start something low cost, even if you don't make much you can learn a ton. Find a way to enjoy the journey. Work on mental health to get stable and set there. Get good at managing your money. Delaying kids but finding a great and supportive partner is helpful. And as someone else said, ask those people you encounter in person how they got to where they got, and what they recommend. You will start hearing similar themes as you talk to more and more people. Best.",

Went to public school, nothing fancy. When I was 12 my parents got a new job opportunity with the same company in a capital city. It was tough the first few years, our family lived in a 2-bed apartment and my brother and I walked to school every day. But my parents started earning better salaries and then we moved into a big house with some other family members. Can honestly say the communal living arrangement helped a lot, everyone chipped in and we were super happy and close together. It also gave us the opportunity to look after my gran, who eventually passed away from cancer.\n\nWhen I was 14 I tried to find a waitering job but couldn't get hired because I was legally too young to work. At 15 I did get hired to waiter on Sundays at a coffee shop at church. I also did some photographer's assistant jobs for my friend. He couldn't pay me a lot to help him, but it opened up learning opportunities. When I finished school I didn't get accepted into university so I took a gap year and worked 4 days a week at my mom's office. On Wednesdays I would attend enrichment classes to prepare a new application for university. I finally got in and applied for financial aid, which was accepted as partly loan partly bursary. So my family didn't have to put me through uni. I worked part-time while studying - while the other students were out partying or traveling, I was grinding to pay for my stuff.\n\nOnce I graduated, I was hired full-time. I didn't have a car or much living expenses and cycled everywhere I needed to be. I started getting some of my own clients and freelancing on the side. Eventually quit my job and took my freelancing further. That was really tough but the amount of learning I did was invaluable. I made a lot of mistakes and sometimes couldn't pay rent. My clients were kind and would sometimes pay for work upfront so I could keep the business going. In the meantime, my study debt mysteriously disappeared - I didn't get any calls, I couldn't log into the portal. It's like they forgot I owed them money at all (I was faithfully paying it every month, so maybe a bursary kicked in that I didn't know about).\n\nI went on to work for a startup and that was a big jump in upskilling. Started studying part-time again and paid for all of it cash. Moved from the big city to a small town where cost of living was much cheaper. Bought a condo and a super nice car, living comfortably, have a Master's degree, no study debt.",

Started washing dishes, then worked at Enterprise Rent-A-Car where I learned sales wasn't about pushing products but understanding what people needed. That led me to real estate, which crashed spectacularly in 2008 - lost everything. But that failure taught me more than any success. Started over in my 30s, explored different business models. Some friends went the franchise route with brands like Anytime Fitness or Sport Clips - lower barrier to entry than starting from scratch but still required capital and commitment.\n\nThe biggest shift for me was realizing that \"connections\" aren't just rich people you know.. they're everyone. The mechanic who fixes your car, the lady at the coffee shop, your coworkers. Every conversation is potential value exchange. Also stopped trying to invent something new and focused on doing something existing but better for a specific group of people.

Here are the ones that stood out inside our company\n\n* AI-driven creative variation connected to real-time audience performance using N8N, Google Veo 3 and Nano Banana is one. All of this feels like marketing finally shifted from static campaigns to a living system that learns and improves on its own and have the space to add the creativity.\n* Second is an automation for my entire company using external tools like Frizerly that automatically spies on competitors to help identity content keyword gaps and publishes blogs on our website to outrank them on Google for searches! It then uses Google search console data to refine the content strategy every month based on results! It can also look at current trends in our industry and come up with blogs based on these as well!\n* Finally, In a 10k+ org we use to wait for days and weeks to get analysis on our marketing performance before we can plan our next move. Now with AI we are able to do this in hours without relying on internal team to pull data for us.\n\nWhat didn't really work out for was AI SDRS! We found that personalized outreach on Linkedin, Email etc performed worse that simple short messages! People seem to smell AI messages from miles away now! Curious what others are upto tho :)",

Blew my mind because of how simple it turned out to be.\n\nWe had production data from a client sitting in CSV exports, weeks of sensor readings and quality logs. The old approach was someone spending hours in Excel looking for patterns, maybe building a PowerBI dashboard that nobody would look at after the first week.\n\nNow we just feed the raw data to an AI, ask it what's wrong, and get back actual insights in minutes. Not charts. Not dashboards. Plain language like \"machine 3 shows increasing variance in cycle times on morning shifts, correlates with temperature readings, likely warmup issue.\"\n\nThe thing that blew my mind wasn't the AI being smart. It was realizing how much time we wasted building visualization tools when what people actually needed was someone to look at the data and tell them what matters. AI does that now. Not perfectly, but good enough to point the engineer in the right direction instead of staring at 50 columns wondering where to start.\n\nThe other one that surprised me was using AI for technical document analysis. Client sends over a spec sheet or compliance doc, 80 pages of dense text. Used to be half a day of reading. Now I get a summary of what actually matters for our scope in 10 minutes.\n\nBoth cases the win wasn't automation replacing work.

Like: \n\n1) Auto- routing support tickets based on sentiment analysis (not just keywords)\n\n2) Dynamic pricing adjustments based on competitor monitoring + inventory levels\n\n3) Lead scoring that automatically triggers different nurture sequences based on behavior patterns.\n\nThe difference: task automation saves you time.

Instead, the ERP ended up exposing the same issues they already had: inconsistent receiving, undocumented stock movements, incomplete BOMs, and irregular counting routines.\n\nOn the other hand, I’ve also seen small teams using modest ERPs achieve excellent accuracy simply because their SOPs were clear, enforced, and part of daily operations.\n\nThe ERP is just a tool. If the underlying process is weak, the system amplifies the chaos. If the process is strong, the ERP becomes a powerful enabler.\n\nSo after many years around these systems, my biggest takeaway is this:  \n**Get the SOPs right first.

I sold them on eBay and Amazon till I had enough to make my own website and brand and moved on to more complex, higher value items that people who like firearms also like.",

      "selftext": "Earlier this year I left construction to work for a small startup. They sold me on equity, growth potential, all that stuff. I took a massive pay cut because I genuinely believed in it.\n\nSpent the last few months learning everything - cold email, LinkedIn outreach automations, n8n automations , lead gen. I was actually pretty good at it too. Booked them 20-30 calls every month.\n\nBut they ran out of money and couldn't keep me on. So that's that.\n\nAlso broke up with my girlfriend during all this. So now I'm single, broke, sitting on all these skills I don't really know what to do with.\n\nMy old construction job would probably take me back. Good money, stable work. But honestly the thought of going back feels like I failed. Like I wasted all this time learning stuff that doesn't matter.\n\nEveryone says \"just freelance\" or \"offer your services\" but like... I have no clients, no real portfolio, no clue where to start.\n\nBeen thinking about doing free work or super cheap work just to get case studies and actually talk to people. But idk if that's the move or if it just makes me look desperate.\n\nThe frustrating part is I can build websites fast now, set up email campaigns that work, automate outreach - all this stuff that should be useful. But none of it matters if I don't have anyone to actually do it for.\n\nHas anyone been through something like this? Like a career change that just feels completely stuck? How did you figure it out?",

I'm flying by the seat of my pants just trying to look as professional as possible and doing good work. \n\nNow all that being said if you absolutely need cash in hand now like gonna get your ass evicted I would humble yourself, go back to the old job and get that stable check while you build yourself back up.

Basically get reviews, get some customers in your pocket and then you have a really really stable platform to jump off of. \n\nThe first way you could make it but it's risky and you basically need to hustle like a mf to make it where the other way will take a bit longer but you'll be more stable.

Their first sale ever was Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies by Douglas Hofstadter, a technical cognitive-science book.\n\nWhy? Because they saw a problem in this very specific market niche. Buyers knew exactly what they wanted, but it was often hard to find these technical books at local bookstores. Amazon delivered them to you. These technical books were their beachhead.\n\nThis allowed them to prove themselves and they quickly expanded to other books, then DVDs then home goods. Now Amazon is the everything store.\n\nIf you are just starting or trying to grow your business think carefully about your market entry strategy. You can't sell to everyone at first. Find that one specific type of customer that has a very specific problem you can solve. That is your beachhead.",

A strong beachhead targets a tightly defined group with a painful, immediate problem, one that doesn't require educating the customer and can be reached efficiently.

We used to have someone on the team doing all of that, and it would eat up hours every week.\n\nWhat’s really surprised me is how much headspace opens up once the repetitive tasks are gone.

          "body": "Honestly, the biggest sanity-saver for me as a marketer hasn’t been just one tool and it’s been learning how to make all the tools talk to each other so they quietly run the stuff I used to lose entire afternoons to. AI didn’t replace the work, it just cleared out the clutter so I could actually think again.\n\nFor example, I’ve been using ChatGPT the way you’re using it for small, purpose-built bots that keep my brain from melting. One watches competitor messaging for shifts, another cleans up client briefs so I’m not decoding chaos at 10pm, and another drafts creative angles so I never start from a blank page.\n\nI’ve also fallen in love with anything that automates the micro-tasks I used to ignore. Motion has been huge for this cause it plans my day for me based on priority and energy levels, so I actually stick to my workload instead of drowning in it. And for client acquisition, Clay has been a game changer. It scrapes, filters, personalizes, and preps outreach in minutes, so prospecting feels less like punishment.\n\nWhat’s funny is that none of these tools are flashy cause they just remove friction. And when you remove enough friction, your business suddenly feels lighter, like you’re not fighting it anymore.\n\nCurious though. Have you tried anything that automates your pipeline yet, not just your workflow?",

The idea of doing what I wanted, when I wanted, with whoever I wanted was incredibly appealing.\n\nI tried everything from trading to dropshipping to mowing lawns, but nothing worked. I was either trading my time for money or losing more money than I earned, always ending up in the negative.\n\nOne day I came across a TikTok video saying the best business to start is the one built around your hobby or interest. Something I realised later, which I think more people should understand, is that when you turn your hobby into a business you never really feel like you are working, and you end up with limitless motivation because of it.\n\nSo I started brainstorming and realised I had a valuable skill. I could go through people’s computers and find cheats or anti-forensic tricks used to hide them. This was known as PC Checking, and it was common in GTA, Minecraft and Fortnite communities.\n\nI was a checker in a few of these communities and eventually found out there were automated scanners that made the process faster and more consistent. They worked well, but they had a major flaw. False positives. Tons of them. They caused arguments, uncertainty and unresolved disputes, and the owners of these tools rarely communicated or seemed to care.\n\nBecause of that, I decided I would create a scanner myself with the lowest false positive rate possible, and I would be an active, communicative owner. That was the moment detectac was born.\n\nFirst I had to build the scanner, which took a few months with the help of my friend wirespider87. When we released it, we got no sales at all, which we expected. So I moved into the marketing stage. I partnered with Discord servers, made videos detecting the biggest bypasses at the time, and uploaded trolling cheaters on YouTube.\n\nMonth one: one sale.  \nMonth two: two sales.  \nThen it doubled every month until we hit £5k in month six.\n\nThat was the breakthrough. An extra £5k on top of my McDonalds job, but eventually the job started getting in the way, so I quit. It was the best decision I ever made. Since then I’ve kept improving detectac and today it is the market leader in PC cheat forensics, protecting over one million players across 12 different games.\n\nJust a crazy story I wanted to share to give someone a bit of motivation. It can happen to anyone if you put in enough work. Try your best, stay consistent, and you never fail if you refuse to quit.",

      "selftext": "I run a small performance design studio and things are usually steady enough. Over the summer I picked up this new client who ended up becoming a pretty big part of my revenue. We were working on the branding stuff for his new business, the early stage bits, figuring out the look and feel and how he wanted the whole thing to show up.\n\nThen bad luck hit. I got slammed with this severe liver inflammation thing. The doctor told me to stay in bed for 2–3 weeks and cut my workload down so I could actually rest. I was upfront with my client about it, and he was super cool. I even managed to send small updates here and there so the project didn’t stall completely..\n\nBut after a point he just stopped replying. No “hey I need a break,” no “I’m rethinking things,” nothing. Two weeks go by. Nothing. I figured he was busy, but after the third week of being left on read, it hit me that the guy I thought was a long-term partner had just ghosted me without a word .\n\nFast forward to last week, I was scrolling through a business subreddit and saw a familiar brand name on my feed. It was him. He was asking for advice on his DIY branding and positioning assets he generated using some online tool. The stuff he posted was nothing like what he first told me he wanted. It honestly felt like he’d gone in the opposite direction overnight.\n\nTurns out some clients don’t tell you what’s bothering them. They’d rather ask the internet than have a simple five minute conversation.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with something like this or am I just catching weird luck lately ?",

Some things to consider:  A relationship where money only flows in one direction in exchange for goods and/or services is never a “partnership.”\n\nYou are a “vendor” to the customer even if you’ve felt a deeper connection and been made to feel integral to their success. Cheaper, flashier, faster comes along and bats their eyes and gives a sly smile and a wink at the customer every day in the form of competition. These days a competitor is the sweet, seductive sounds of AI, and the continuous news stories we hear of “AI to replace ‘x’ number of jobs.\n\nSo your biggest take away should be asking: how do I keep/retain my best clients? What process do I have to always be prospecting for new clients? If I ranked my clients into A,B,C,D list \n“buckets” - how quickly can I fire my D list clients and replace them with A list preferably or B list that I can develop into A list? \n\nAnd lastly, re: retention - any time a single client makes up more than 25% of revenue you are at risk. You inevitably start putting more effort into that account to the demise of your other clients. Come up with a feedback process that allows you to pulse check every account on a regular basis - and even if you get “We love you and will name our first born after you” - always be prospecting for a replacement client. They are always looking for ways to cut costs.",

You may have been too, and I'm sure others here have been.   Sometimes when you have a small business, shit is just completely frantic, chaotic and scary.  Combine with ADHD, a healthy amount of OCD, stress and having no time for real thoughtfulness and you make rash decisions.  Also, shits expensive man.

          "body": "It reminds of something that has always perplexed me. I write business plans. I've written 2,000+ plans since 2006, have been subcontracting for years, and the clients I serve have paid $2-3,000 for their plan. Every once in a while, a client will take the plan I have written, show it to someone who has no experience writing plans, at least not anywhere near as much as I do, they'll get some negative feedback, and then they'll come running to me and tell me to \"fix it.\" There are at least three distinct versions of this story - but I'll just stop here to keep it short. \n\nIt never ceases to amaze me how a client will pay thousands of dollars for an expert consultant like me to do work, then show it to someone with comparatively no experience and come back to me and make me to do what the inexperienced contact said needs to be done. All of a sudden, I'm the dumbest guy in the room?! I never get over it. But along similar lines I learned when I started out as a business planning consultant that people don't want me to tell them what to do, they want me to do what they tell me to do.\n\nLesson learned in the twilight zone: 99% of the time 99% of entrepreneurs want to be the Boss in all their dealings.  \n\nSo, now I tell all my clients, as your consultant I'll tell you everything I know, and you'll always have the last word. And whatever they do on their own will never surprise me again. It might aggravate me, but it won't surprise me. In fairness to business owners, I think it has something to do with the personality type of the entrepreneur.  We are likely to be a bit of a control freak anyway, and one who will play all ends against the middle by our very nature just to make sure we come out on top. \n\nYou might hate to hear me say this, but you can never allow one client to become the be-all and end-all of your business. No matter how much money they give you, the lifeblood of your business can never depend on only one client because if they go south, then you will suffer mightily. Nothing feels better than landing a whale of a client, and nothing hurts worse than when they turn their back on you. In fact, part of the reason, they turned their back on you might be so they wouldn't have to depend on YOU too much.\n\nThere is one particular category of entrepreneurs that almost always does this as a matter of routine practice, and they think it automatically makes them smarter, even though it doesn't. Don't sweat it - it's not you, it's them. On the brightest side: they're neurotic about winning. On the darkest side: they don't know what they're doing, and they don't know how to spend their money. Make it make sense\\~\\~ \n\nP.S. Old joke: an entrepreneur is a person who wants to start their own business and they're not sure how to do it, but they're not going to let a little thing like that stop them. Sometimes you have to laugh to keep from crying\\~\\~ \n\nP.P.S. Your supreme challenge is this: can you respect their universal grope for entrepreneurial wisdom and remain friendly with them? I'm not saying you have to like them, but if you can at least remain calm and friendly if you ever talk to them again, I promise you'll be much stronger for it. And I didn't say it was going to be easy, that's why it's your supreme challenge. Besides, there are plenty of fish in the sea, and plenty of whales ...",

None of whom wanted to be the one who got designated to handle the paperwork for his contract, out of fear of it being lumped on them for the duration.\n\nSo when his original hourly-rate contract reached the point where, traditionally, it would have been converted to a far lower weekly or monthly rate, no-one did it. And he kept getting paid something like $400/hr for every timesheet he put in, including any overtime he decided to rack up.\n\nNearly a year later, someone started asking questions, and he was (finally) kicked off the contract. But the department couldn't recover the better part of a million dollars they'd paid him by then; he'd quietly followed all the rules of the original contract, done all the work his many, many bosses had tossed his way, and the switchover from hourly rates wasn't something which happened automatically on a given date - it had to be signed off by one of the managers employing him.",

What else is going on that you don't yet see?  \n\nAs for this particular issue why is a business using auto-pay for a subcontractor (or anyone at all)?  Should be receive invoice - manager approval - GL coding - cash management / second approval - issue payment type process for everything.  Autopay means that process doesn't happen each month.  I'd fire / reprimand whoever approved or setup the autopay.\n\nAs for a 'proper financial team' - if you don't have one, then the business owner needs to be the whole team until that is figured out, IMHO. But I do realize some owners are more sales or visionary and not operational-minded and that may be impossible.  In that case, with 24 people you have some size to the organization. It may be time to outsource those finance functions but it needs to be more than a bookkeeper.  We are talking bookkeeping, controller, virtual CFO, tax compliance, the whole works.  A team that helps you build and run those operational processes.   They are hard to find but after 20 years in business we finally found someone and it is the best money I spend each month.",

He turned into someone completely different, never helped with anything and I was sick of it. I finally got him to agree on selling the business and parting ways and it was delay after delay. “One more push to get our profits up so we can sell for more”. That never stopped and finally he said I don’t want to sell anymore. I said f it, and asked for his terms for me to exit. I have no regrets. Outside of the partnership being a disaster dealing with employee BS, complete gut punches anytime there was a negative review, things seeming like they are going great and getting hit with a shit pile. I couldn’t do it anymore. I tried doing it differently, I tried sticking it out, I tried new methods of communication, I tried everything. \n\nWhat I am grateful for is I went through severe burnout for the first year and mapped out everything I was spending time on, started journaling and meditating and these two things alone changed my life for the better. I was able to manage the shit storm of the small business, but ultimately saw no end in sight. I know social media makes it seem like you should never quit, keep going, grind it out, it will get better. Sure maybe. But also it might not. What’s your piece of mind worth? I lost money, but guess what? before I stopped I was losing money, my time, and my peace of mind. So I decided I only wanted to lose money moving forward. \n\nWill I start another business? Yes, but it will be under my terms and with more clarity. If you feel like you’re never moving forward it’s ok to stop. Chances are you’ve learned a shit ton, and can takeaway some great things from the experience as I did. \n\nIt’s ok to step away. You didn’t fail, you learned. This is not advice to quit but rather determine whether or not it’s time to move on or change how things are going. \n\nHope you can take your life back one way or another. The only thing I urge you to do is start meditating, journaling, and mapping out your time.",

Typically, this is picking up mail from the client once a week, applying customer payments to invoices, entering their bills and printing checks for them. It also includes adding any credit/debit charges and categorizing them and reconciling the statements every month. Most clients get a full set of reports near the start of the month - this is often more than just a P&amp;L and balance sheet. I also do their payroll and communicate with the accountant and treasurer as needed. \n\nMost of the larger clients are around 15-20 hours per month ($750-$1000) and the smaller ones can be as low as an hour or two.

But we had to let go and I thought it'd be quick, maybe a few weeks of paperwork to get it down but wow was I wrong like nobody warned me about the actual shutdown part like you spend all this energy building something and then when it's time to close it down you're just... exhausted already, uk? And then Delaware needs this form, IRS needs that form, you're chasing down old contracts you forgot existed, a software subscription still charging u monthly, and man let me tell you this but every time I thought we were done, something else popped up. And I had to endure this for 2 months. Two whole months of this, two months of feeling like I couldn't move forward because I was stuck dealing with the past. My partner checked out emotionally pretty early, so most of it fell on me to the point where there were days I just wanted to walk away from the whole thing but kept thinking about what happens if I miss something important, what if Delaware keeps billing me or we get sued years from now because I didn't file something right.\n\nBut yeah, it's over now. Really over. And I'm sitting here feeling this weird mix of sad and relieved and tired and kind of excited? Like I can finally think about what's next without this thing hanging over me.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next tbh, I might start something new eventually, might just work for someone else for a while and not think about any of this.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to share because I see a lot of startup content but nobody really talks about this part it's messy and it sucks and it costs more than you think but you get through it eventually",

My brain was fried, it wasnt even a celebration, more like a reset. For the next one, I'm say go with your vision and your convictions 100%. \n\nI learned the hard way to never do business with family or anyone who can't follow your vision. Not understand it, just stfu and follow it, do what I say. No unsolicited opinions. And thats a big thing when you open a new business, every asshole loves to give advice. \n\nWe closed it in 2017 after 3 years and to this day we sometimes talk about it and the regrets. Everyone had their own vision, their own shit ideas. They all agreed on my original business plan but then shit kept changing on a whim.\n\nMe and my parents were on the same page but when it came to execution of the business, our relatives fucked it up. Shouldn't have gotten involved in the first place.\n\nOur vision was changed and relatives kind of took over. My parents went along with it because they felt like they had no choice.\n\nIt built so much resentment, even from me to my parents because they let it happen. I wasn't in the position to tell my relatives anything, but they were. \n\nIt was such a shitshow. Hard lessons though, fuck if we had done my original plan, it would've been successful. I see it everywhere now, our original idea for that location was executed better by other people because they did it correctly. Multiple different businesses are thriving there now, with the same vision I had before all of em. \n\nAnyway, it sucks but we learned so much from that. Mostly the psychology side of it like you can't be nice and let people walk all over you, even family. Can't be too nice to employees, and definitely should've shelled out some money to hire an experienced manager. They cheaped out on that too. \n\nI'm going to start a business again in the coming months, this time I've been researching and planning much more thoroughly. \n\nThis time it will be a singular vision. My vision. No one gets to fuck with it. No one gets to give me advice on what to do, and get butthurt if I don't follow their bullshit. \n\nIf they don't like it, they're fired. I'm steve jobbing the fuck out of this thing. That is the only way. Good luck on the next one.",

The founders have to do everything until they outsource, hire, or automate. \n\nIn some ways, doing everything teaches you very quickly what you need to get ride or and how much you will pay to get rid of it. \n\nAn office manager (VA, etc) might be the first hire so you can focus on revenue generating tasks. Automation that you can easy into is also a focus in the early days. Even if there is only 1-3 things you can automate, the sooner you get that stuff off your desk, the better off you will be. Do not wait until you are 100% busy as the transition (outsourcing, training, automation) will soak up some time. Better to commit to a transition when you are at 70% to 80% of capacity.\n\nExpect the early efforts to outsource, hire, automate will stumble or not be smooth. It is all part of the learning to be a CEO rather than the production person.\n\nI am working with a company right now who is very busy with the work so it is hard for them to focus on automation. We are getting there. Presently, it is a grind (long days and me providing the automation help). For another client, they have more capacity yet they really need to focus on more sales so they can afford some of the costs to scale up the team plus automate.\n\nA bit chicken and egg is my message. As someone else said, you need spare cash to fund the business growth. Working on the business vs in the business. The working on requires a bit of cash now so you can gain more than it costs in benefits later.\n\nThere is no magic here. There are things you did not know or did not understand. Normal for a young business when the founders have not built a company in the past.\n\nA business that keeps you busy and never grows is a lifestyle company or a hobby. If you want growth, there has to be time and money invested in working on the business.\n\nGood luck. Reach out if you want to chat further. Or, keep posting questions in the group and leverage the experience of those who are already where you want to be.",

Like you said, days go by and you're like \"wait, did I actually do any real work or just shuffle papers and respond to emails?\" I used to joke that I became a professional email answerer who occasionally did the thing I actually started the business to do.\n\n\n\nWhat helped me was timeboxing all that admin stuff into specific blocks. Tuesday mornings became my \"business operations\" time where I'd batch all the receipts, forms, emails that weren't urgent, etc. It felt weird at first because you feel like you should be \"working\" but honestly? That IS the work when you're solo. The key is just not letting it take over your entire day every day. I also started keeping a running list on my phone of all the random business tasks that popped up so I could deal with them during those scheduled times instead of dropping everything every time something came up.\n\n\n\nThe tax stuff though... yeah that never gets easier. I still have a folder labeled \"things my accountant will explain to me like I'm 5\" because some of that stuff just makes no sense.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.",

That feeling of not getting to the “real work” because you are buried in emails, forms, and receipts is way more common than you think.\n\nOne thing that usually helps is drawing a hard line between what only you can do and what absolutely anyone competent could do for you. Stuff like tracking receipts, organizing expenses, and staying on top of tax prep is important, but it does not have to be done by you. That is exactly the kind of work a good bookkeeper can take off your plate. I work with Linda Rost’s Better Bookkeepers, and people in her lane basically specialize in turning that pile of “admin and tax stuff I don’t understand” into a simple, organized system you barely have to think about.\n\nYou are not failing at business; you are just hitting the point where doing everything yourself stops making sense. The earlier you start offloading some of the back-office stuff, the faster you get back to the work that actually grows the business.",

          "body": "Go old school.   \n  \nMake a To Do List in a google doc or Word every morning that you print out on paper every day. First do a brain dump of every single thing you need to do no matter how urgent or how small. Write today's date at the top, then pick the things you must to do today and time box them. This is the only way you'll know what you have time for.   \n  \nI follow the mantra ***\"****Create in the AM, Connect in the PM,*\" but depending on your own energy patters use your energetic hours to do creative things, use your wind down time to do meetings and connect with people. If you have an extra five minutes, use the mantra \"*Do One Thing.*\" It might be one thing not on the list, one thing from tomorrows list, one extra thing, or just one thing. When you're really fried, use the mantra \"*Every little bit counts.\"* This will remind you that even if you simply make one phone call or take out the trash, that you're making progress.   \n  \nWhen you get something done, physically cross it off with a pen. If you need to add something, write it down. Next day edit the list from the day before, rinse and repeat.\n\nI'm sure there is science around this, but there is something magical that happens in this old school process. The brain dump reduces anxiety because you're not holding things in your head hoping they won't fall out. Creating the list each morning is very zen, and crossing things off is very affirming. There is no app in the world that works this well. I encourage all of my clients to do this, whether they're in real estate, tech, or have a brick and mortar.   \n  \nI know it sounds crazy, but it works! Hope this helps!",

I’ve never had a client behave like this and I don’t have a mentor to run this by.\n\n**The Context:**\n\n* I have a client who started construction **before** the building permit was issued. He is currently panicked because he’s risking a Stop Work Order or worse.\n* The City review process has been frustrating. The reviewer used generic \"boilerplate\" comments and didn't mark up/redline the reports, just the plans. This ambiguity caused a 3rd review cycle.\n* The City charged a re-submittal fee. It is **$150**.\n\n**The Conflict:**\n\n* The Client is demanding I pay this $150 fee out of my own pocket.\n* My contract (and industry standard) states that all agency/permit fees are the Owner's responsibility.\n* I am currently fighting the City to waive the fee on his behalf because I agree the review was lazy, but I told the Client I will not pay it personally if the waiver is denied.\n\n**The Behavior:**\n\n* He is texting me \"???\" late at night.\n* He told me \"I’m a businessman, I know how this works,\" and accused me of \"not taking ownership\" because I won't pay the $150.\n* **He has threatened to sue me.**\n\n**My Position:** I feel like he is projecting his anxiety about his illegal construction onto me. He wants me to pay the fee to validate his narrative that the delays are my fault, not the City's or his own. I’m holding the line on the $150 not because of the money, but because paying it feels like an admission of guilt/liability.\n\nHas anyone dealt with a client like this? Am I wrong for refusing to pay a small fee just to make him shut up, given that he’s already threatened legal action?\n\n**TL;DR:** Client building illegally is trying to bully me into paying a $150 City fee and threatening to sue. I'm standing my ground.",

I was actually pretty good at it. Booked them a ton of calls. \n\nBut they ran out of money and couldn't keep me on. So that's that.\n\nAlso broke up with my girlfriend during all this. So now I'm single, broke, sitting on all these skills I don't really know what to do with.\n\nMy old construction job would probably take me back. Good money, stable work. But honestly the thought of going back feels like I failed. Like I wasted all this time learning stuff that doesn't matter.\n\nEveryone says \"just freelance\" or \"offer your services\" but like... I have no clients, no real portfolio, no clue where to start.\n\nBeen thinking about doing free work or super cheap work just to get case studies and actually talk to people. But idk if that's the move or if it just makes me look desperate.\n\nThe frustrating part is I can build websites fast now, set up email campaigns that work, automate outreach - all this stuff that should be useful. But none of it matters if I don't have anyone to actually do it for.\n\nHas anyone been through something like this? Like a career change that just feels completely stuck?

Keep in mind that only 1% of startups ever make it big, and the next 20-30% have a mediocre exit often at a loss where employees don’t make much money at all. You could’ve been \"wasting\" years there and not make any money. That is to say, failure is an almost expected outcome for most startups. \n\nYet, if you understand the likely monetary outcome, joining a startup is an amazing opportunity to learn and grow on many dimensions. You said it yourself: you learned about a bunch of tools, techniques, and became good at it. Don’t discount how that may help in often unpredictable ways in the future. \n\nMy take: Go back to construction, own the experience and learn from it. Reframe the failure in your own mind. And rebuild your financial foundation and do some reflection over a year or so. If you want to give a startup another try you can always apply / look around in the future.",

Of course this is something I’m mostly interested in. I’m looking to get into Cyber security. You can try Data Analyst, IT, and many other types of tech jobs. I’m not the smartest tool in the shed but I’ll tell you what, I can’t keep going on breaking my back for a job that if I get hurt I’m literally gonna lose everything and have no back up plan. Imagine getting a tech job and working from home. Not all tech jobs are like that but many are. Plus the starting salary will be comparable to what you’re likely already making, maybe 40-50k and after you get some experience that can go up to 70k to 100k+ depending on the field you’re getting into. Many variables like how big the company is and how much you keep learning and pushing yourself to the top. And I’m gonna be honest, you’re gonna need to spend probably about 4 hours a day studying and some certification exams cost about $350 or more. But people spend 80k to study this stuff in a college and go into debt. You can do it at home for a few thousand dollars and get multiple certificates in a year or two and start applying for jobs.",

          "body": "The \"no ads\" approach works until you need predictable revenue, then it becomes your biggest bottleneck. Organic growth through word-of-mouth and social content is great for validation, but it caps your growth at the speed people naturally share - which is slow and inconsistent.\n\n\n\nYour question about \"how to get customers fast\" reveals the core tension: fast customer acquisition requires paid distribution. You can't manufacture urgency and demand at scale without putting your offer in front of targeted audiences systematically. Facebook and Google ads let you control exactly who sees your cookies and when.\n\n\n\nStart with $10-15/day on Facebook ads targeting your local area with a simple offer: \"Handmade cookies delivered today in \\[your town\\]. Order by 2pm.\" Use photo carousel ads showing your actual cookies, not stock imagery. The algorithm will find people who click and convert within 3-5 days.\n\n\n\nThe mistake most food businesses make is waiting until they have \"perfect\" branding or enough inventory. Start running small test budgets now to learn what messaging works, then scale when you have capacity. Spending $300-500 in your first month will teach you more about customer acquisition than 6 months of organic posting.",

It recently became my responsibility to reconcile the UPS invoice we get weekly and it has become clear that UPS is essentially scamming us out of hundreds of dollars a week. I wanted to see if others have been having the same experience. \n\nWe are being hit with two surcharges mainly: “dimensional weight adjustments” &amp; “address corrections”. These sometimes amount to more than the original cost of the shipment, are often not valid and easily disputed, and feel very much like UPS attempting to skim money from businesses that are shipping enough to not be able to catch these additional fees. \n\nWhen speaking with our account executive, she mentions that they use an automated (I assume AI) system to image and measure packages. I’ve asked for proof from this system on a few occasions for dimensional adjustments and received nothing, but have had disputes accepted instead. She also has mentioned that the team that handles the surcharges is “third party and overseas”, which makes me think they are receiving a portion of these surcharges, incentivizing them to overcharge and not accept disputes. \n\nAnyway, just want to know if this is a common issue others who use UPS for 30+ shipments a week are experiencing.

It’s about leverage.\n\nWhen people first heard the term “AI automation,” they thought it meant we were going to build agents to replace every human. And to be fair, that idea exploded back in 2022 everyone was hyping up these giant end-to-end agents that were supposed to do every step of your workflow for you. But in the real world, those types of systems didn’t hold up they broke, they bottlenecked, and half the time they created more problems than they solved.\n\nSo businesses learned pretty quickly: full automation is not the goal.\n\nAI automation was never really about automation, it’s about leverage, and here’s what I mean by that:\n\nInstead of building for the sake of building, you need to understand and apply the Golden AI Ratio. It usually looks like this:\nAutomate the first 60% of the process, the boring, repetitive steps.\nUse AI to assist a human on the next 30% the parts requiring judgment or context.\nLeave the final 10% manual, because sometimes a human simply does it better.\n\nThis is what actually makes businesses faster, smarter, and more profitable.\n\nSo the real question isn’t “How do I automate everything?”\nIt’s “Where does AI give me the most leverage, and what ratio of AI-to-human will maximize that?”",

And we've built others where it's more like 40/40/20 because the context changes constantly. The key isn't finding one perfect ratio, it's identifying which processes have consistent enough patterns to automate vs. which ones need human judgment.\n\nThe shift from \"automate everything\" to \"leverage strategically\" is where the real value unlocks. We burned $50k on a chatbot that tried to do too much autonomously before we learned this lesson. Now we design around what we call \"augmentation before automation\", get AI handling the repetitive context-gathering and formatting work, let humans make the judgment calls, and only fully automate the processes that are both high-volume AND low-complexity.\n\nCustomer support is a good test case.

We found the best starting point wasn't a huge, complex workflow, but identifying the most soul-crushing, repetitive tasks. Things like transcribing meeting notes, doing the initial sort of inbound emails, or pulling standard data for a weekly report. The goal was never to eliminate the person doing the job, but to eliminate the most tedious part of their job. It completely shifts their work from \"painstakingly building from scratch\" to \"quickly reviewing and refining,\" which frees up so much time and mental energy for the creative and strategic parts of their role that a human is genuinely better at. The human touch is still 100% the most important part of the process",

Even if your business doesn’t change at of your customers will be using it and your interactions with them will change.\n\nHere’s my take, in the near term everyone will be able to instantly put together a mediocre / moderately acceptable work product of most professionals or specialists.\n\nNeed a will? AI will write one.  Need a report or analysis? AI will create one.  What are your symptoms? AI will diagnose you.  Summarize pdfs, books etc quickly.  Create mediocre graphics instantly, create PowerPoints etc\n\nOn the fast/cheap/good triangle AI now has dominated fast and cheap and the only way to compete is to go all in on good as #1 and fast as #2.",

It's a hit or miss though, and recently has been feeling more like a complete miss with my phone ringing with scam callers and my website getting hits internationally. ",

He worked for the state, and the PTO credit could be counted on like clockwork. \n\nSo the day after his PTO hits, he calls in with some excuse. One of these excuses was that he's walking up some stairs, he slips, his knee hits the edge of the stair right between his kneecap and his leg, and because of this his leg is swollen and he cannot bend it. \n\nThis all sounds credible enough, and of course the friend likes to go in intricate detail to really sell the point. \n\nNow the funny part. When he finally does go back to work. He's committed to this scheme of having a knee injury so he commits to limping around. Not only this, but he figures that if it was a legitimate injury at the beginning of a shift he would limp just a little bit, and as the day progressed he would limp more and more and so that at the end of the day he was really limping. Now I know for a fact this was all I made up story because we were drinking buddies at the time and I heard him concoct the scheme before he even did it. \n\nOkay and so now the cherry on top. After doing this for a few days, because of knee injuries not just going to go way overnight right, he's actually given an accommodation and an official recognition of service because of his working injured.",

      "selftext": "Edit: I ended up cutting him loose with a $1500 bonus. He said he understood and we ended on good terms. He had the opportunity to go back to an employer that can provide health insurance which he needs right now. It still doesn’t feel 100% right because I didn’t fulfill the initial agreement. I learned a lot about setting expectations with employees for next year to avoid this specific issue and other issues we had throughout the season (mostly pertaining to wage and drive time - which mostly comes back to me having bad planning and being bad setting expectations).\n\nI am a small business owner of a seasonal business. I just hired my first employee this year to help me. In the ad I put up on Craigslist, I mentioned there would be about 28-30 working days at a rate of $200 per day with a $1,000 bonus at the end of the year if he stayed with me the entire year.\n\nMy employee is excellent so I bumped him up to $220 per day with a few days of $300 and $360. Now we are getting toward the end of the season and I am realizing I can finish the remaining 7 work days on my own and there isn’t enough work to justify having an employee for those days. I would be losing out on about $1,500 by keeping him around but at the same time I feel obligated to keep him working because although there is no contract, I feel that I committed to the full season with him and I should just eat the cost and chalk it up as a learning experience.\n\nMy decision is between cutting him loose early and still paying him the $1000 bonus or keeping him on and eating the unnecessary cost of $1500.\n\nHas anyone been thru similar experiences?

          "body": "Do you want to keep this guy for next season ? I’m obviously not familiar with your business but as a small business owner of 25 years and 26 employees we’ve found that it’s been best practice to try and keep our staff and keep them tenured rather than rehiring . The opportunity costs in our business are pretty significant when it comes to training and getting staff up to speed. Our average staff tenure is going on 16 years, with some well above 20-25 years and you can’t overestimate the contribution made by experienced and well trained staff to the point we find things for them to do during slow periods just to keep them on even if some of it is low priority plus flexible work schedules and enhanced benefits. We’ve never done any sort of analysis but I suspect it costs us a lot more to train a new staff member anywhere from $10-15k per employee, compared to rewarding our experienced tenured staff a portion of this through quarterly and year end bonus. We just had two employees return after leaving the company in 2019 and 2022 and both were at least a year ahead of new staff members hired roughly the same time. Lots of opportunity costs when it comes to finding and training in our business. We will do almost anything, with reason to hold onto good talent. Not sure how hard this is for your business and industry. Keeping staff loyal has made our company what it is today which I’d say is modestly successful with year over year growth and the opportunity to increase revenue and profitability. I’m also a push over when it comes to these sorts of things but it has worked for us. The few new hires we have made end up being 50/50 in terms of their abilities and commitment but once we find someone we will try and do everything possible to keep them even if it costs us money in the short run. Sorry if we are comparing apples to oranges but I can’t emphasize just how important it has been for us to keep smart, hard working and loyal employees on staff rather than trying to replace them. During the pandemic when our business basically went from $16-17 mill in average revenue to literally $0 for about 2 years , we continued paying everyone a modified but liveable salary and we went millions 2 million into debt even with getting 2 forgivable PPP loan for almost $1 mill total, but we’re able to quickly retire that debt after 2 years whereas we’d still be pay that off if we had to restart with new hires or mostly new hires. I think doing the right thing when it comes to keeping promises has never been more important. Good luck and I hope you figure it out.",

I make a lot more than I did when I worked in finance.  I generally have a lot of free time and don't work 40 hours a week (I probably work about 10 to 15 hours).  On paper it's ideal.  But, even then, it's still stressful.  Mistakes get made.  Clients get demanding.  Employees are in a bad mood.  \n\nI have a key employee that is going to move out of state in about 6 months.  I actually bought his business in 2020.  He was supposed to train me to run it, but that never really happened.  Instead, he continued to work here and, despite my best efforts, sort of continued to run that part of the business somewhat separately.  I've never really gotten the two companies to be one cohesive unit.  It's really frustrating.  I knew this guy was not the best communicator, but it's been a lot worse than I thought it would be.\n\nNow he plans to leave.  I still owe him over $100,000 and I feel like he hasn't held up his end of our contract at all.  The three guys that were his employees (and are now my employees) are not really able to work without his constant guidance.  I know the wheels are going to come off that portion of the business once he is gone.  I have a feeling all three of his guys will quit.  It's not the end of the world since I don't think any of them are that great.  But still, I know it is going to be stressful.  \n\nThe past few days I have been wondering if I should just shut the entire business down next summer.  My husband says I should sell it, and logically I know that is probably what I should do.  I had a good business for 4 years before I bought this second company.  That portion of the company will still be good and runs well.  It's also quite profitable on its own.  But, man, I am just tired right now... A large part of me just wants to walk away.  But I also have no idea what I would do with myself if I didn't have the business to run.  ",

If he is your employee, you can set standards and expectations of what you expect from him. If he hasn’t had time to show you, maybe go in and work more than 10-15 hours a week and then he may have more of a chance to show you that.\n\nSecondly, do you have a working relationship with these 3 employees, or do they pretty much just stick to this guy? I would suggest spending some time with them, work alongside them as you learn the business that you paid so much money for (and continue to owe). They may have ideas on how to grow the business.",
