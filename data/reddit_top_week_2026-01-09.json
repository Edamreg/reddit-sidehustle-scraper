There's no skill you can learn in a month that reliably pays $1k/month. Most of this is compounding over time. You have to go into it accepting it might not work in 1 year, maybe not even 2 - but in 5 years it will.\n\nIt's that saying \"People overestimate what they can do in 1 year and underestimate what they can do in 10\"",

          "body": "My job is market research. Reputable companies should compensate adequately for the time involved but often the survey ends up longer than it should be. Better money is in qualitative research - focus groups (live or online) or individual interviews (usually online). Because we expect you to spend 30-60 minutes or more, compensation can be $100-$200 and it's more fun. \n\nBut - getting those opportunities depends on passing the screener survey, which depending on the client/product category, asks about product use and things like whether you have kids or cats, etc. Ex, if you don't have a cat it's pointless for us to get you in a discussion about your experience with cat food. \n\nThe easiest way to get survey projects (qual or quant) is to:\n\n1. Be in the demographic most companies want to sell to - usually 28-45.\n\n2. Sign up to be on a panel and fill out their forms on demoraphics, product use, lines/dislikes. You'll get more targeted screeners. Lots of research companies have panels and you can be in as many as you like.\n\n3. Participate in one of those apps where you scan your receipts. Often, those are owned by companies like mine who use the data from the receipt uploads to provide real info on sales and demographics to manufacturers and retailers. Data is provided in aggregate and clients aren't allowed to contact panelists. The US now has very strict privacy laws and we have to abide by them or risk a lawsuit that could put us out of business. Our lawyers will only let us work with clients who sign our PII agreements.\n\nThe value of doing this is that if the marketing research company has your verified purchase info the screening isn't as annoying. It's not as much of a fishing expedition to find the right respondents, don't have to send a ton of surveys to people who don't qualify, so you don't waste their time. \n\nBottom line - this is legit but not in any way a regular thing, not even a part-time job. Most companies have rules about how often they will send surveys to the same people because it's not in their interest to burn panelists out or talk to the same 1000 people all the time. \n\n I'm about to retire and if I was a panelist I would not get many survey invites because of my demographic. Also, if you don't consume a lot of stuff, you won't get a lot of survey invites either. The point of market research is to understand how to sell stuff to people who like to buy stuff! \n\nNote - I have never worked in political opinion polling so I don't know how that works or what they pay.",

It was messy, I learned as I went, but it works because there’s a structure.\n\nA few things that might be helpful for you:\n\n* You don’t need a Social Security Number to get started — several legit platforms and processors have workarounds (especially if you have residency or a passport)\n* You already have the tech (Mac + iPhone 16 Pro) — which is all you really need to run the model I use\n* What does matter is being willing to learn marketing and sales psychology (which is what I teach my team)\n\nWe don’t just hand you a link and walk away, it’s mentorship, shared sales, and systems that duplicate. You’re never left to figure it out alone.\n\nIf you’re open to exploring how it works, I’m happy to share what I built and how I’d approach it if I were starting from your exact position.\n\nNo pressure, just clarity",

      "selftext": "Roughly 12 months ago I traveled to Asia (Japan and China) for just over two weeks. I had an incredible time and an epiphany I wasn’t expecting. \n\nThis is the most time I have consecutively taken away from work, fully focused on fun and relaxing. I work in sales, six figure deals, grueling hours, but I find it for the most part fulfilling. \n\nWe flew from Japan to China to see my partners family, flight from Tokyo to Shanghai, and then a 3 hour drive. This left me with a ton of time to reflect on the trip so far and also the trip to come. I felt completely overwhelmed by the idea that I want to be able to do this more. I started thinking about ways to make passive income to pay for a trip like this again, but in reality money wasn’t as much of the issue as time was. \n\nI have a job that doesn’t allow me to work remote nor would it be a good idea for me to negotiate a hybrid or remote position at my current company. My job is reliant on being in front of the consumer. So I pivoted and started thinking about what I could possibly do at the same time as my day job, with minimal risk.\n\nAfter traveling in China and returning home with a huge inspiration to break out of my predictable life and really try something new I began brainstorming. I thought about all of the things that I saw in Asia that I didn’t see in the US.\n\nAfter a lot of time compiling ideas I remembered these charging kiosk that were everywhere in China. Scan a QR, portable charger pops out, plug your device in and carry on. We used these a few times when we needed a boost and it was so easy.\n\nInitially I began looking at sourcing a kiosk like I saw from a Chinese company, but that idea faded after confusing product descriptions and huge shipping costs. \n\nI know this exists to an extent in the US, I have seen versions of this product at malls, stadiums, and a few restaurants. Most of these required an individual sign up, leaving your phone at the kiosk, or no where to return it.\n\nI found a US company that created a product that I felt was closest to what I experienced in China. I scheduled a call with a rep to learn more and I was impressed. The rep answered a lot of questions and encouraged me to “act fast” as this was around the time that the tariffs were being introduced.\n\nI bought 10 kiosks that house 10 portable power banks available for rent. \n\nI live in New York City, a place I believe could hugely benefit from an integrated portable phone charging infrastructure. In my head this was like the “Citi bike” of phone charging. \n\nUpon receiving my 10 kiosks I started my outreach to businesses. Again, I currently work in sales so I assumed this was the easy part. I had a pipeline full of leads, I made an excel tracker to monitor my business and I was off to the races.\n\nI sent probably 500 emails and got one reply which I later found out was an AI assistant lmfao. I continued the email outreach but changed my template and introduced some A B testing. I added cold calls to the equation…\n\nIf you have never called a business in Manhattan and tried to pitch something, let me tell you… character building. Anyways I had no luck. So I also incorporated messaging on social media, which surprisingly got the most traction.\n\nHere is the question:\n\nMy rep told me that If I at any point wanted to return the chargers he would buy them back from me.\n\nSo after almost 12 months of trying to make this work should I call it quits? Or am I not trying hard enough?\n\nI certainly assumed this would be easier and that my sales background would make it almost a cake walk but I have been humbled.\n\nI have more ideas on gaining traction in the new year but at the same time I am so sick of failing. \n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

Since school is starting - throughout the year I'm committed to growing the businesses social media accounts - so I'm gonna be posting on Instagram/TikTok because hopefully by the time the school year ends I want like 50k followers. What type of content should I post though? Also as for the study guides/resources part we haven't sold any paid products although we've provided hundreds of free resources for students. Any advice?",

It was amazing to check on the earnings at the end of each month and realize that I made money doing almost nothing.\n\nOver the years bandwidth sharing apps have become more popular and there have been a lot of different apps launched. I have experimented with several of them and know how hard it is to find the bandwidth sharing apps that \"work\".\n\nSome are fake and will never payout. Others are dangerous and can infect your device. I have learned the hard way how to vet these services and now I launched a website to help people find the best bandwidth sharing apps.\n\n[ShareData.app](http://ShareData.app) is a directory of bandwidth sharing apps classified by reliability. I launched this app out of my dorm room with a few friends who are also passionate about passive income.\n\nEvery month we update the classification based on three criteria:\n\n1. Financial Return\n2. Payout Reliability &amp; App Consistency\n3. Safety, Security, &amp; Risk Mitigation\n\nThe goal is to help find the bandwidth sharing app that pay their users and do not harm your system or use your bandwidth to access any troublesome sites.\n\n**We do not accept any sponsorships nor do we use any advertisements.**\n\nNew bandwidth sharing apps cannot use our platform to advertise themselves and our ranking is based solely on the performance of the bandwidth sharing app.\n\nWe are hoping this community benefits from this directory and welcome any feedback you have about the website!",

      "selftext": "Posting this because one of my comments in another thread in this sub unexpectedly blew up and a bunch of people asked me how I ended up here. I thought it was a great opportunity to do an AMA, so here we are.\n\nMy story started as a management consultant in Canada during COVID. I worked at a lower mid market consulting firm, but the pay was honestly not great for the hours and the grind (carrot and stick) never really clicked for me.\n\nWhen Covid hit, I did what a lot of people did and tried to build something online. I did a bunch of research on Youtube and decided to I should launch a dropshipping business selling an ergonomic product. It failed for the many reasons a lot of you probably experienced. Supplier was unreliable, shipping was a mess cause of COVID, and I was learning Meta ads, Google ads, and ecomm operations all at once. Looking back, it was exactly what you would expect from a beginner trying to learn everything in real time and trying to master global supply chains during a global pandemic. Painful, but it forced me to actually understand paid traffic and conversion, which ended up mattering later.\n\nA few months after that, I came across a Twitter thread about local services booming. Plumbers, electricians, cleaners. People in trades making serious money. I brushed it off. We had just lived through COVID and the idea of strangers in homes still felt uncomfortable. Then a few days later I saw another tweet (gotta thank the Twitter algo for that or else I wouldn’t be where I am today). A girl my age sharing her story about running a remote cleaning business. No cleaning herself, just managing demand and cleaners. It sounded almost too simple, which made me skeptical. I DM’d her, we had a short back and forth, and she pointed me to a resource that made everything click and work for her. It was a course from an ex Wall Street guy who built and scaled his own remote cleaning business. I obviously did not buy anything right away. I had never bought a course in my life and was still in the mindset of having to do more research and “If he did it, I can figure this out myself”. That said, I signed up for their free content and started reading the emails. The free content and emails broke the model down in a way that made it click + paired with my own research I understood this was legit and not some other online business trap. I eventually bought the course. I am not going to promote it here, but I do want to give credit where it is due. The material and the free 1:1 calls that came with the course with the person running it genuinely changed the trajectory for me from that point on.\n\nThings moved fast. It took me about 20 days to set everything up. In hindsight, it could have taken a week. I am naturally skeptical, and skepticism is the enemy of action so I kept double checking things, doing extra research, and trying to disprove the model and what was being taught. Ironically, the more I did that, the more I realized how simple and underserved the cleaning market actually is and how all the steps make perfect sense.\n\nChoosing a market to open up shop in ended up being straightforward. The rule of thumb is pretty simple: avoid massive cities like Miami or LA. Too competitive, too many sophisticated players, lots of illegal labor. Focus on smaller cities and towns with decent population and income (there are A LOT of them). Anything under 1 million people is great, closer to 500k is ideal. The idea is to be a big fish in a small pond. As part of the selection framework you should also be looking for markets where the biggest cleaning company barely has a functional website and maybe 30 Google reviews mot. Once you find a market like that (there are plenty), you then show up with a good brand, modern looking website with online booking, and great client experience.\n\nPersonally, I picked a market and have never expanded outside of it because demand still feels endless. Cities with high rental turnover are especially good. Student towns with colleges are gold. Landlords do not clean themselves. They will pay $400 to 600 for move out cleans without hesitation. Even today, about 20-30% of our monthly revenue comes from moving related cleans. Higher ticket, easier to execute since homes are empty.\n\nFinding cleaners is usually the biggest bottleneck and the only real stress you’ll have throughout your journey. You almost always have more demand than supply, which is a GREAT problem to have, but turning down clients because your cleaners are all too busy strings. In reality, it was a me problem because I was not approaching it well. I was relying only on job boards but once I started posting in local Facebook groups, I unlocked A LOT of new applicants and found several awesome teams that allowed me to scale. A piece of advice I am very glad I did follow though was hiring cleaners before launching any ads. Finding clients was the moment where everything became real. The first two cleaners I hired are still with me today. I have always been extremely selective during the hiring process, which is what I was taught to do, and that felt uncomfortable at first, but is the right thing to do. Once you stop trying to rush this step and find the best channels for your local market, the whole thing becomes much smoother.\n\nWe landed our first client on the first day we launched ads. A biweekly client paying $140 booked online. I remember being nervous dispatching the first cleaner, waiting to see if something would go wrong. Well.. the clean went great! Payment processed after the clean and I personally called the client, thanked them, and asked for a 5-star review, explaining we were early and it really helped. He left one and has been a client ever since. He is grandfathered into that pricing forever. I will do almost anything to never lose him because of how symbolic that first full loop was.\n\nThat first month we closed seven more clients, including a few one time deep cleans. At that point I was fully hooked.\n\nHere are my rough revenue numbers, month by month.\n\nMonth 1: 3.4k  \nMonth 2: 5.2k  \nMonth 3: 7.8k  \nMonth 4: 11.5k  \nMonth 5: 14.9k  \nMonth 6: 18.3k  \nMonth 7: 22.1k  \nMonth 8: 26.7k  \nMonth 9: 31.4k  \nMonth 10: 35.9k  \nMonth 11: 38.2k  \nMonth 12: 42.6k  \nMonth 13: 39.8k  \nMonth 14: 44.1k  \nMonth 15: 48.9k  \nMonth 16: 52.3k  \nMonth 17: 58.7k  \nMonth 18: 57.4k  \nMonth 19: 55.2k  \nMonth 20: 55.0k\n\nRoughly 60% of revenue is recurring. The rest are one time deep cleans or post renovation cleanups (we got into this a few months in). We do 0 commercial right now. I want to add it this year because higher ticket recurring contracts could realistically double the business.\n\nAbout 4 months ago, I hired my first virtual assistant in the Philippines. It took about a month to fully onboard and train her. She now runs the day to day operations (not easy to “let go” but 100% worth it). I spend about an hour a day on the business, sometimes less because I only step in for rare edge cases, escalations, or when she has a question (we just text). That was the moment the business truly felt passive and not just location independent in theory. Having a high % of my business being recurring helps with the transition as things are already rolling.\n\nTwo mistakes I made early on: 1)  I underestimated how much Google reviews matter. I automated review requests and it worked, but once I started personally following up with texts and occasionally calling clients, reviews grew much faster. We were already ranking top 3 locally due to low competition, but reviews massively increased organic bookings. 2) I waited too long to raise prices. Early on I was uncomfortable charging over $50/hr. Once I realized I had more demand than supply, I raised prices to an effective $60-65/hr depending on the job. Almost no negative impact. Demand kept coming in.\n\nHappy to answer anything.\n\n  \nEDIT: Cleaners are all independent subcontractors. I have 0 employees on payroll. They bring their own equipment and supplies (which is factored into their rate which is far above market).",

It sounds like the client side of bookings and payments is fairly automated at this point - is that a service you pay for, or did you design/commission your own website to handle that process? Related, how automated is the subcontractor scheduling side of things, or is job assignment and handling scheduling problems the hands-on VA job? Do you carry any sort of commercial liability insurance for this?    \nThanks for your time. I'd also like a DM to review the course info when you have a moment.",

Margins get thinner because you are paying your cleaners well. \n\nEven if you make 100$ per job. 30$ goes into ads so basically you are making 50-70$ per job\n\nOn top of that some clients will not pay, some will pay half the amount because they were not satisfied.

I wanted to address one question that came up most often:\n\nWhat if the market I'm interested in already has a bunch of players with decent websites and a bunch of reviews?\n\nThe answer is that it doesn't matter. Just avoid shitshow markets like New York or LA. This market is so big that demand feels never-ending. There are countless cities and towns across the US or whatever country you're located in. If you're the number 10 player in the market and you're making $40k or more in revenue a month, well, who cares? You're literally making $40k or more. Ideally, you want to find a market that is underpenetrated, but trust me, most of the companies that have over 100 reviews with a decent website and running operations making over $2M are operated by amateurs or people that are not even picking up the phone half the time. Also, they have A LOT of overhead so far less flexibility and margin to play with than we do. The opportunity is endless, just execute marginally better than them and you will take market share VERY quickly.",

      "selftext": "So I have a small YouTube channel about home organization and decluttering, been doing it since like March last year. Making around $400-500 from adsense depending on the month, plus maybe another $150-200 from affiliate stuff. Not huge but pays for groceries.\n\nLike I did a video about organizing under the sink and it got 80k views, that one probably made me $200. But most videos get like 5-10k views.\n\nProblem is I spend like 10-15 hours a week filming and editing and im kinda burned out. My wife keeps saying I should post the same content on tiktok and instagram. She sends me tiktoks of other organization accounts like \"see they're making money, you should do this.\" Shes probably right but I really dont want to film everything twice. Also my youtube videos are like 12-15 minutes and nobody watches that on tiktok.\n\nBeen trying to repurpose content for the past 2 months and its kinda working but also kinda a mess. My workflow is all over the place. Sometimes I use Descript to pull clips, sometimes I just do it manually in CapCut cause Descript crashes a lot. Sometimes I use those AI avatar things for videos where I dont want my face, tried a couple like APOB and HeyGen but not sure if people think its weird. Sometimes I just use stock footage with my voiceover.\n\nSo far after 2 months:\n\n* TikTok: posted maybe 30 videos, got around 2k followers somehow, made like $45 from affiliate links\n* Instagram: posted 25 reels, got maybe 700-800 followers, made $30\n* YouTube Shorts: posted 20, complete waste of time, best one got 400 views\n\nThe annoying part is I still dont know what actually works. Some of my avatar videos do ok on tiktok, some flop completely. My real face videos are hit or miss too. Algorithm makes no sense.\n\nAlso im spending like 5 hours a week just repurposing stuff which defeats the whole purpose of trying to save time. Like yesterday I spent 3 hours trying to export a video and CapCut kept freezing. Almost gave up.\n\nFunny thing is my wife started posting the same content on her own account just using her phone and shes already at 5k followers in like 6 weeks. Meanwhile im here spending hours with all these tools making $45 a month on tiktok. She keeps laughing at me.\n\nNot sure if I should keep doing this or just focus on YouTube and forget the other platforms. Anyone else deal with this?",

Freelancing or small service businesses online, like basic SEO cleanups, customer support, or simple video edits, still pay if you get a couple steady clients. Marketplaces are noisy and you’ll see a lot of ghost jobs and recruiter spam, so build a tiny portfolio and pitch directly. If you just need something steady while you ramp up, wf​haler​t is a simple service that emails vetted remote jobs like data entry or admin work, less junk to wade through.

I think that has to be the reason you get into it, passion for something. People can grow quick and make money but generally that doesnt last long term because youll burn out from it.

          "body": "Forget about the year. The fundamentals of making money haven't changed in a decade. Most of the noise you see about AI automation and microtasks is garbage designed to keep you poor. Real income is never passive when you start. It is active, painful work. If you want realistic results, you need to ignore the shiny objects.\n\nThe most reliable path is simpler than people admit. You need to sell a product that solves a painful problem. This can be software you promote as an affiliate or a simple digital guide you create. That is it. I wasted years jumping between dropshipping and crypto before realizing that boring businesses pay the best. You don't need a groundbreaking idea. You just need a boring system that works every day.\n\nPick one traffic source and master it. It will feel like you are screaming into the void for the first six months. That is the barrier to entry. Most people quit there. I built my entire income stream by focusing on email collection while everyone else was chasing viral dances. Build an audience, move them to an email list, and sell them something useful.\n\nDo not overcomplicate this. Focus on one thing until it works. The only reason people fail is that they get bored and switch lanes too early.",

      "selftext": "I've been lurking on this sub for a few months now and it genuinely changed how I think about making money on the side. I started out looking for quick ways to make extra cash and ended up building something way more sustainable than I expected. Now I'm sitting at around $1000/month from mainly 2 streams, so I'll share what worked:\n\nThe Main Thing : Canva Creator Program ($600-800/month)  \nI've been uploading FB and IG ad templates to Canva since earlier this year and it's turned into legit royalty income. The cool thing is I don't need to keep uploading to maintain the cashflow, it just compounds over time. All those elements and templates you see in Canva are made by individual creators and we get paid a small percentage based on how much they're used by Pro subscribers. Since I started earlier this year I've been seeing consistent growth month over month.  \nMy process is super simple. I use Meta's Ad Library to see what's working in paid ads right now. You can filter by industry, see what formats are popular, and basically get a masterclass in what converts. Then I take that inspiration and add my own twist to it. Sometimes it's color schemes, sometimes it's layout variations, but the core structure is based on what's already proven to work. I mostly upload ad templates, gradients, and design elements. A lot of it is stuff I make while warming up before actual client work or things I created for projects but didn't sell the IP to.\n\nThe Background Stuff - GPT Apps ($100-200/month)\\[I know it's been said 100 times on the sub alr\\]  \nI saw a post on this sub a few days back about someone using their spare time to do GPT apps and it reminded me that this is something I've been doing too. I replaced my scrolling time with these apps. Like instead of mindlessly going through Instagram or Twitter for 20 minutes, I'll open one of these apps and do surveys or game offers.\n\nI'm pulling around $100-200/month from a mix of survey platforms and game reward apps. Some months are better than others depending on what's available, but it averages out to that range.  \nThe biggest shift for me was understanding the difference between trading time for money and building assets that pay you repeatedly. The Canva stuff is asset building. I make a template once and it earns for years. The reward apps are time trading, but low effort time that I'd waste anyway. If you're just starting out, don't sleep on things that seem small or beneath you. I almost didn't start with reward apps because I thought it was kind of lame. But even $100 is real money and it required basically zero skill to start.  \nAnd if you have any creative skills at all, seriously look into Canva's creator program. The Meta Ad Library trick alone is worth trying, even if you're not uploading to Canva. It's free market research. Anyway, this sub planted a lot of these seeds for me so figured I'd give back.",

Without going into too much detail I focus on a top 20 crypto that  has pretty much stayed in the $12-30 range for the last few years. I have a bot that simply automates sales orders every time the price fluctuates 1.5%. This isn’t enough to replace my day job when you average out the good &amp; bad periods and even if it was I’d probably just divert that income to other investments for the time being but it’s enough that if I suddenly got laid off it would cover my bare minimum under realistic but bad conditions and potentially exceed my day job during short periods of high volatility.\n\nExtremely low effort and surprisingly high ROI but there is a fair amount of fluctuation due to the market plus the risk that it could all go to zero. Also a reasonable but respectable amount of capital is involved (think a year’s worth of salary).\n\n\n\n\nA shocking percent of people in the investing space have very little knowledge of accounting, forecasting, understanding financial ratios, hedging, etc so you could possibly create content to address that gap and get better returns by using “sweat equity” instead of cash to get the ball rolling.\n\nAt the end of the day though you have a few factors you gotta balance: time, capital, risk, and required returns. You can make a ton of money with little risk and little effort if you have a lot of money to start with,  can make a lot of money with little upfront effort if you are willing to lose it all, you can put in a ton of time and build something that will reward you down the road, etc.\n\n\nThere is no such thing as a free lunch so you gotta tweak the inputs to get where you are comfortable but passive income isn’t a myth but you do gotta temper expectations. It’s unrealistic to think that you can replace your day job with zero effort and $1k. But depending on how much effort &amp; capital you are willing to invest you can build a nice revenue stream.",

The features typically lasted from about a week to a month. As soon as the featuring stopped, I dropped back down to a very low number of sales.\n\nMy game was free-to-play (with ads), with a paid option (premium, no ads). Replayability was low (two things I would definitely change if I were to release a narrative game again). In short, the Play Store is extremely competitive — you get pushed out quickly in favor of new games. If I had managed to sustain $600 a week, I would have been the happiest developer.",

On average I’m around $1,000/month, and more importantly the process compounds as account size grows. With conservative deltas and liquid names, \\~1–2% per month is very realistic if you don’t chase premium. Below is proof.\n\nObviously:\n\n* Account size matters\n* Risk management matters\n* This is not free money\n\nBut compared to a lot of “passive income” ideas that rely on hard work, creating saas, freelancing, real estate and tenant, platform risk,  etc etc  I’m surprised this strategy barely shows up here.\n\nFor transparency, I’ve made my results public on my profile so people can judge for themselves.\n\nHappy to discuss risks, downsides, or why people here avoid it.\n\nproof: [https://optionwheeltracker.com/trader/brotrader](https://optionwheeltracker.com/trader/brotrader) (not a referral link - not selling anything here)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ws1uhc5fksbg1.png?width=3024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2fbb5cc267eba9248878be465d4b785a90985e6\n\n",

I have found premiums to be higher on cash secured puts than on covered calls, but at this time I have more covered calls than cash secured puts sitting out there as my puts always seem to get assigned (which is more or less part of my strategy).",

          "body": "I also do CSP but I don't do the wheel thing. Sometimes I roll to a future date if I'm at a loss or close to loss. My success rate is around 80%. I pick the underlying stocks following a refining process that I'm still improving:\n\n1. Pick underlying stocks: I wrote a program to screen stocks based on some of my own formula and no earnings coming out before the expiration date (my formula calculates a value similar to IV so higher value implies higher premiums). Or sometimes I just pick the ones I'm more familiar with and repeatedly traded before;\n2. Further refining: Pick those with 1% - 1.5% biweekly premium. (Don't chase higher premiums and avoid pharmacy stocks. I've been bitten by those.)\n3. Then: Look at fundamentals. Select a few with good fundamentals or I'm confident / familiar with its financials.\n4. Next: Review technical charts and find the patterns that I like.\n5. Finally: ask Chatgpt if any meaningful events will happen before the expiration date (for example debt maturity). (Sometimes a future event will make the premium high)\n\nAt this point I'll have 3 - 5 stocks I'll sell CSP.\n\nI close or roll the position if I the stock falls to near or below the striking, or I have 80%+ profit, or the premium for the rest of the days is too low to hold. I very rarely get assigned.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. Don't chase high premiums.\n2. The game is in a way that you can win 10 times, but one loss could wipe most of the gains if not all, so need to be extra cautious with losing positions, epecially when the market is on a downhill where you have higher chance to loss.\n3. I trade in a margin account where my money is fully invested, and I use the margins to secure puts. The good thing is that you are not actually using the brokers money so it is interest free. So if you can boost your total return by a few percent with CSP that is still a win. The bad thing is that you have to be extra cautious with margins. I usually use a margin within 30% of my account value.",

When you're running a side hustle, you can't afford variable per-second billing that spikes every time a user runs a complex prompt.\nWe spent the weekend migrating to Hypereal AI as a replicate cheaper alternative. \n\nThe main reason we switched was their credit system ($10 for 1k credits). It’s so much easier to calculate your \"profit per user\" when you know exactly what a generation costs, rather than guessing based on milliseconds of GPU time.\nIt’s been a solid replicate cheaper alternative so far no monthly \"vampire\" fees, and the API handles Flux and video models without the cold start lag we were getting before. If you're struggling to make your AI side hustle profitable, I'd highly recommend looking into a credit-based infra provider. It literally saved our margins.",

          "body": "I have a lot of irons in the fire right now, most of which are absolutely not passive. The one that is relatively low effort/bordering on passive: Social media pages (mostly Facebook, but starting to spread out).    \n   \nI started a Facebook page over the summer with the intent to monetize it. It finally happened about 2 weeks ago. The money isn't great yet (~$200/mo), and I definitely made some mistakes that are impacting that, but I'm learning and there's a pretty clear path to scale the money. I think it could be \"good enough\" income for me within the span of a month, and full-time job replacement income within 6 months. I'm able to spend part of an afternoon making and queuing up posts once every two weeks. So not fully passive, but pretty low effort.   \n    \nAnd that's just from content monetization (i.e. just getting paid to post). No affiliate marketing, no selling anything (although I'm working on print on demand stuff), no brand deals. I would like to sell my own merch, but the rest of the stuff I don't want to deal with, and shilling someone else's stuff doesn't really mesh with what I've made.    \n    \nI'm trying to settle on what my true attempt #2 is going to be, but I have a basic framework mostly narrowed down.",

Unsubscribe and hit the three dots and select Don't Recommend Channel. Do not watch them. They're liars. Period.    \n    \nSecond, pick a thing and commit to it for *at least* a year. Anything you pick, you need to tell yourself \"Ok, I'm going to do this for a full year.\" I've certainly fallen into the \"it didn't work in the first couple weeks\" trap, and the problem with that usually is that you don't set a duration.      \n   \nIt's always    \n\"I'm going to to this and see what happens.\"   \nand not   \n\"I'm going to do this for a year and see what happens.\"   \n    \nMaking that mindset shift where you know how long you're in for is a huge help. Being 2 weeks in with no progress feels bad. Being 2 weeks in with no progress when you know you're committed to 52 weeks isn't a big deal because duh, you're just starting. Of course you're not seeing progress yet, and that's ok. You're going to keep going because you've barely scratched the surface.   \n    \nHonestly, if you cannot commit to doing one thing for a full year, don't even waste your time starting.",

I used to mow lawns on Saturday mornings and it was paying my mortgage every month. I set up a [Google business profile](https://business.google.com/en-all/business-profile/) in my town and that is where I received all of my leads. The Google business profile is cool because it’s free and if you work on getting good reviews you’ll probably out rank your competitors. People locally constantly turn to Google when they need a service. Something you could do is graphic design that specializes in logos and use ChatGPT, grok or Gemini to design them for you. You can get leads by making a google business profile for that as well and set up the primary category as “graphic designer”. Make sure you fill out the google business profile fully, so add photos, website, etc. If you’re worried that you don’t know how to build a website then use something like [Carrd](https://carrd.com), which is super easy to use and very cheap. Also, I read in newsletter [side hustle builders](https://open.substack.com/pub/sidehustlebuilders) that if you have a local garage sale/business facebook group for your town you could get leads that way too just by networking.

It’s actually a bunch of modules but they are so quick and short to watch or listen to, I was literally able to get through it while taking care of my two kids full time just by having my ear bud in and the course playing on my phone. I also actually just asked in the course what other people were doing to make the most money in the least amount of time and with the least amount of energy! Because I didn’t have time to test them all out either. The course I got has several coaching calls a week and is just a really great environment to keep you on track.

I don’t touch a single line of code.\n\n\nI’m basically a human \"editor\" for AI. I read through responses it generates and help refine them so they’re more accurate and conversational. \n\nIf you have a good handle on language and a sharp eye for detail, that’s really all the \"technical\" skill you need. They didn’t require any prior AI experience to get started, which was the big selling point for me.\n\n\nA few things I’ve appreciated so far:\n\n\n**Real Flexibility:** I log on when it fits my schedule. No one is hovering over my shoulder.\n\n**Low Barrier to Entry: **You just take a skills assessment in your strongest subject (like writing or general knowledge) to get started.\n\n\n**The Work Itself: **It’s actually kind of interesting to see how the \"brain\" of an AI develops based on the feedback you give it.\n\n\nIt’s been a great way to get into the tech space without having to go back to school for a CS degree.

It was a lecture for a college class, no one was mic-ed except the professor and he asked a lot of questions to the students. I had to determine the different students with only the audio, like if one answered more than 1 question i had to be able to recognize their voice. no video came with the audio. I submitted it several times and it was rejected for failing to properly identify speakers correctly, despite the otherwise accurate transcription of what was said. that was very frustrating.\n\nanother job involved a non-native english speaker with a strong accent.\n\nbasically, the starting jobs seemed to be the jobs the seasoned workers didn't want to touch. if i remember right, the more jobs submitted and the better the accuracy, the higher priority one could get for the easier to transcribe work.\n\nthe time required and the pay for that time wasn't really that good for someone like me, my typing average at the time was about 65wpm at 99% accuracy which i admit, isn't that impressive, basically the bare minimum needed for the jobs.\n\nif you are a fast and accurate typer, have good listening skills and hearing, it might be feasible if you stick with it. especially if you have and know how to use the foot pedal transcription things. you still might get work rejected however, sometimes for reasons that seem unfair or don't make sense. having a low rating at the beginning can prevent more work from becoming available.\n\njust my take on it, like i said, it was awhile ago and maybe they have changed. it is a legit company though. i did get paid. it was not easy and not much.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,  \nI’m a student and I recently started learning basic coding and also basic video editing.\n\nI see many people online getting freelance clients, but I feel confused because:\n\n* I don’t have advanced skills yet\n* I don’t want to do fake stuff\n* I can only do small tasks like:\n   * fixing small bugs\n   * writing simple programs\n   * editing short videos / reels\n\nI also want to get ratings and reviews to build my profile faster, so I was thinking:  \nCan I do small quick tasks or surveys just to gain ratings, even if I don’t mention that as my main skill?\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Is it really possible to get clients with only basic skills?\n2. Should I mention my skill as just “coding” or be more specific?\n3. What is the fastest realistic way for beginners to get their first client?\n4. Is it okay to do short tasks / surveys only for ratings in the beginning?\n5. Which platform worked best for you when you were starting?\n\nI’m ready to work hard, I just need the right direction.  \nAny advice from experienced freelancers will help a lot.",

Google seems impossible to rank in for anything with decent volume.\n\nI keep seeing people mention pinterest for affiliate marketing so I tested it for the last 6 weeks using tailwind for scheduling and it's already sending more traffic than google (about 540 visitors last month). The setup was pretty simple, just creating pins for my product reviews and roundup posts and posting consistently.\n\nBut I'm curious what other traffic channels are actually working for affiliate sites rn? Youtube seems like it takes forever to build. Instagram doesnt seem great for affiliate links. Reddit can work but you have to be really careful not to be promotional.\n\nFor context my niche is home fitness equipment and my monetization is mainly amazon associates with some direct affiliate partnerships. Pinterest traffic is converting okay (around 2.1% CTR to amazon) but I wanna diversify beyond just one platform\n\nWhats your primary traffic source and how long did it take to become meaningful?

          "body": "Some things to keep in mind, since the topic of time has been touched on. (Years) and consider what starting actually means. I intend to touch on the corners that I didn’t see explored much on these posts. \n\nI started out learning about running a business and started my own experimentally before i considered myself an entrepreneur. \n\nI started learning skills long before i considered myself an entrepreneur. I filed for my first llc etc; long before i needed to, and did a lot of derping around as do many of us. \n\nThe things I would say I learned that would have sped up the process was, consistency, in particular if your plan requires building and nurturing an audience. Also take advantage of Ai. Sure you can be successful without it, probably. But why make it harder on yourself? Be mindful of shiny object syndrome. The strength i already had was willingness and vision to pivot.\n\nI did make some money as a consultant as I’ve built out other things. I had a client who was previously a CFO and I learned a lot through that.\n\nLearn from whoever there is to learn from. Make sure they actually have success and know what they are talking about. Be very mindful of any partnerships or collaborations you make. \n\nTo bring another important perspective I haven’t seen much of on this thread, the people in your life have a huge impact on your success. So does self awareness. There’s a higher prevalence of things like narcissist personality disorder and adhd (me lol) in entrepreneurship, so self awareness and solid boundaries and genuine confidence are super important. Yes there are people who don’t have these who are successful, but it definitely makes it easier. You will learn all of these things the hard way if you don’t learn it with intention. \n\nBe mindful of bottle necks, and learn to take calculated risks. Those that are risk averse tend to be less likely to get to this level as well. \n\nYou are in control of your own time and life. You will find how much of the time we tend to spend doing busy work that doesn’t actually move the needle. Failure is feedback. That’s it. \n\nYour self care MATTERS. I have spent countless time living off of redbull and prayer. Learning balance gives you a clear head and the opportunity to make better decisions. \n\nWhatever you struggle with today and master tomorrow is an important opportunity. Especially if you struggled because you couldn’t find the thing you needed and had to create your own solution. Simple is almost always better.",

Then in October I had some personal stuff come up and I literally had to set boundaries. Started blocking out actual work hours, stopped responding to non urgent stuff after 6pm, and told clients upfront that I batch my communications twice a day.\n\nI was honestly scared theyd leave. But the opposite happened? My retention jumped to like 89% over the last 3 months. Clients seem happier, they respect the boundaries, and weirdly they value my input MORE now. I think because Im not constantly available Im forced to be more strategic with my responses instead of just reactive. Im working probably 15 hours less per week and somehow I've actually got some money set aside ($2.3k from Stаke) now which never happened before. Sometimes doing less is actually the move.",

When you’re always on, clients start to treat you like support instead of an expert. Putting structure around your time changes that dynamic and makes your input feel more intentional.\n\nBatching communication also forces better thinking. You’re not just reacting to every message, you’re responding with context and strategy, which is what clients are actually paying for. The retention jump kind of proves most clients don’t want 24/7 access, they want clarity and confidence.\n\nA lot of agency owners only learn this after burning out.

Here's one:\n\nDo not quit your job! At least not right up front. You made up your mind to quit and start a company. Fantastic. My advice is not to quit your job to pursue your company full time until the last possible moment. While you are still working (and getting paid!) spend six months or so in the evenings planning. Get a team together, do your research, build a business plan, go another level deeper and get all of the detail of product development and the company administration planned out.\n\nBuild as much of your company as possible while someone else is footing the bill for your survival. I can't tell you how many times I've had this discussion and when I say this the founder hangs their head a little. My response - you quit your job already, didn't you? Founding a successful company is hard enough without putting the (unnecessary) added pressure of having to worry about survival money on the first day. Even if you've saved, why not use a continuing salary from your current job to get going.\n\nMore in future posts. Hope this helps some.",

      "selftext": "hi everyone, \n\ni've been building serviceorca with my team, a zero-commission marketplace for service providers. We launched in September 2025.\n\n  \nmy original go-to-market strategy was:\n\n1. launch in UAE then expand to US and then other countries.\n\n2. burn cash on ads to get plumbers/electricians etc to sign up.\n\n3. burn cash on SEO to rank for keywords.\n\n  \nthen the weirdest thing happened. In October and November we started seeing registrations from random places, like small towns in Europe, Asia, USA, UAE, Australia, etc. i assumed it was a spam bot, but the profiles were real service providers. \n\ni dug into referral traffic. it wasn't google search. it was AI.\n\n  \npeople and other agents were asked tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, perplexity, Claude, ... you name it: \"where can i list my service business for free?\" or \"alternative to Angi/Thumbtack with no fees\"  \nBecause my site was new, lightweight, and the value prop was clear (\"Free\"), the AI models picked it up and started recommending it as the primary answer. \n\n  \n**The result**\n\n* 5 years ago i would have needed a massive budget to get 1000+ worldwide verified listings.\n* Today, AI did the heavy lifting for free.\n\nI decided to pivot. i scrapped the \"US Only\" restriction. if AI wants to send me a carpenter from Berlin or a graphic designer from Tokyo, i'm taking them.\n\n  \n**The challenge now:** The \"Supply\" side (service providers) is scaling automatically thanks to AI. Now i have to solve the \"Demand\" side (customers) to make sure these pros actually get work. \n\nThings are growing slowly, but surely, and i see the progress over there. \n\nI'm curious if anyone else has stumbled into this sort of \"accidental\" traction recently? To be clear, i don't consider this \"success\" in the traditional sense yet - we aren't huge, and we still have a mountain to climb regarding revenue and daily active users. But as a first step, having AI drive our initial user base for $0 feels like a fundamental shift from the old playbooks. If you've had similar small wins or weird AI- driven growth stories in these early stages, i'd love to her them. ",

Just New York alone is a crazy big market to build significant local traction for a single services category to be remotely interesting to the buyer side. Your AI just created a huge problem where you have to get A) millions and millions of listings to be interesting enough in just one city and B) get world wide consumer traction.\n\nIn my opinion AI already totally messed up your directory and you might have to start over again. These  marketplaces work if you have at least one category, in one single city figured out well.\n\nIts a bit the same as when you let your META ads just focused on lead volume, often you only get volume of the shittiest possible leads. Thats why algo's need guidance, same with AI.\n\nBut yeah, fun experiment.",

None of your friends have become doctors, and hardly even nurses after two years.\n\nWhat do you mean you've always been an entrepreneur at heart? you just started your adult life.\n\nI don't want to give life advice, it's all about you and how you want to live your life.  If you really have entrepreneurial spirit this is most likely what you should explore. If you want to be a doctor as well, be an entrepreneurial doctor. Become a dentist and aim for a chain of dental clinics. Become a surgeon and instead of curing people fill up their boobs, or much easier, just spend your days injecting some tiny amounts of liquid into their lips and muscles for massive profits. You can be passionate about heart surgery yet invent a non existing procedure or device and make millions upon millions, and you can do that probably do similar in almost any medical specialty.\n\nNurses? overworked and probably underpaid. Doctors? mostly very busy, stressed, have no life, and probably therefore even if well paid are underpaid, since they have no life and are literally giving their life away to the job.\n\nYou quite simply need to decide what you want to be and how your want to live, and what kind of lifestyle you want in the future.\n\nSo what if your first business is failing or failed, or your second or third. If and when you make it, you could retire while watching your peers give their lives away for \"good pay\" and status, but literally having no life. However, you could also keep on failing forever, or at least not making it the way you want to and they took over in any way that you consider as a success, be it home ownership, an expensive car, a trophy wife, or whatever else people compare themselves with, with their peers.  None of that is a guarantee of any degree of happiness. In fact I guess most people are unhappy, frustrated or jealous in some shape or form.  Life and your choices are filled with risks, and you need to be able to live with your choices.\n\nYou are right to start thinking about this early, however, you need to always be vigilant and decide what is best for you, and what your path is, and be flexible at allowing yourself to make a change at any moment.\n\nTry to look far into the future, and think where you REALLY want to go.",

Most contractors can receive it within 1-2 days.\n\nPayoneer works well too and some freelancers prefer it cause they can keep money in USD and withdraw locally when rates are good.\n\nReal talk though - just ask your contractors what they prefer. Some countries have better options than others. Like in Philippines, GCash or local banks might be easier. In India, direct bank transfer through Wise works great.\n\nSet a specific pay date (like 1st and 15th of month) and stick to it so you're not constantly managing who got paid. Automate reminders so you don't forget.\n\nThe 10% fees you're seeing are prob from using the wrong method. Switch to Wise or Payoneer and it drops to 1-3% depending on country.",

That works, but it hits a ceiling fast. What’s worked better for us is helping the right people realize they even have a problem before they’re in buying mode. Content and real examples have done more than ads there.\n\nOne thing I didn’t expect: founder-led stuff works really well. People don’t trust brands that much, but they do trust people. Sharing honest takes, lessons learned, even mistakes in places like Reddit or smaller communities builds trust surprisingly fast.\n\nWe also stopped trying to make broad content. Generic blog posts didn’t move anything. Very narrow, very specific content for one clear ICP did.\n\nCold outbound still works too, but it’s way better when it’s not actually cold. If someone has seen your content or recognizes your name, replies go up a lot.\n\nOverall, what’s worked best is just showing up where our ICP already hangs out, talking about the problem, sharing what we’re seeing, and helping.

Same cycle of idea → plan → build → see the result. Tangible output you can actually touch, which is satisfying in a way that software sometimes isn't.\n\nTeaching or mentoring. If you've been building things, passing that knowledge on can be weirdly fulfilling. You're still \"building\" something - just with people instead of products.\n\nOpen source contributions. If you're technical, you can build things on weekends that aren't tied to revenue pressure.

Same goes for dating, if you care about that: being with a person who shares your passion for whatever is the most amazing feeling. You can talk about them for hours about the specific thing you have a shared interest in. \n\nHowever, if it’s really causing you distress, that you feel like all you can think about is entrepreneurship, then to me it sounds like you’re in a bit of a burnout actually. \nMaybe you are overwhelmed and don’t actually have the mental capacity to care about anything at all. \nMaybe you could have a break where you get away from your routine for a while and try something new, like going to a pottery class, skiing, hiking - whatever it is that can take your mind off things and maybe reinvigorate you.\n\nFinding a new hobby, although this shouodn’t be the goal, will also help you achieve more in your entrepreneurial endavours because you’re able to switch your mind off and actually think more creatively again therefore be better at problem solving.\n\nPs: don’t listen to people calling you boring, you are not, rest assured!!",

At 23 I was hitting numbers that looked great from the outside. But internally I was constantly stressed, exhausted, and close to burning out. Not because the business was failing, but because I had built it in a way that worked against who I actually am.\n\nI was showing up in sales calls, client conversations, and daily work in ways that didn’t feel authentic. It felt like I had to perform a version of myself every day. Over time that creates a huge mental tax, even if things look “successful” on paper.\n\nThe hardest realization for me was understanding that you can build something profitable that still drains you if it’s misaligned. I spent years thinking the heaviness was just part of the grind. Only later did I see that the business itself was designed wrong for me.\n\nWhat I’d do differently much earlier is design the business around how I actually want to work, communicate, and think. Money matters, obviously. But being able to wake up and say “this feels like me” matters more long-term. That shift alone removed more stress than any revenue milestone ever did.",

Every decision touches cash, people, reputation, and tomorrow’s workload. There’s no clean “off” switch.\n\nCash flow stress is different than I expected too. Even when things are going well, it never fully relaxes. You stop thinking in months and start thinking in weeks.\n\nThe part no one really warns you about is **loneliness**. You can’t fully vent to employees, clients, or even friends without filtering. Most of the pressure gets processed quietly.\n\nWhat I’d do differently: build decision filters earlier, talk to other founders sooner, and stop pretending grit alone replaces systems. It doesn’t.\n\nThat’s the real work behind the highlight reels.",

      "selftext": "My journey started out of necessity, not ambition. I was working at a truck repair shop when management kept making these insane decisions - one after another. Me and my coworkers eventually had enough and quit. At the time, I didn't realize I was about to become an entrepreneur.  \n  \nThe next few weeks were a blur. I was hustling just to keep the lights on - reselling stuff on eBay, fixing phone screens, building basic websites for friends. Whatever paid the bills. One night while I was down the reddit rabbit hole, I ended up on r/Entrepreneur and saw this post about someone crushing it with their cleaning company. I remember thinking 'why not? I could do that.' I’m writing this post hoping it inspires someone reading this as it did to me back then.   \n  \nStarting off was rough. I had no idea how to find cleaners, price jobs or even structure the business. The first website? Just a cookie-cutter theme that every other cleaning company was using. But it worked well enough to get us started. As we grew, I realized the website needed to be better - this wasn't just some placeholder anymore, it was an actual asset bringing in money. So I invested in a proper logo and custom site. We kept on growing but felt limited by leads we were getting as most of them were paid. The cost to acquire clients was high and we wanted to convert as many as we can - which presented its own challenges.  \n  \nThis prompted us to look at how to rank our website which took me on another trail I wasn’t ready to go down on. The first overseas team we worked with ranked us but for landing pages built on their website and for keywords no one was searching for! At that time I didn’t understand long tail keywords or much related to the art of sending signals to google. I soon moved on and tried my luck locally. We hired a local firm on a premium retainer basis and under a year-long contract to deliver us that sweet local organic traffic we hoped would result in bookings. A year later? Barely anything to show for it. Started investigating and found out the blog content I paid for was recycled from their other cleaning clients. The back-link strategy? Just a web of links between all their customers. I was beyond pissed when I figured it out.\n\n  \nAt that point, I'd been burned enough that I just started learning it myself. Optimized our Google Business Profile, rebuilt the website properly, created actual useful content and a bunch of other stuff - the agencies should've been doing way back. We started to see the organic leads increase month by month and stopped relying on paid leads eventually. It took years and cost me way more than it should have, but it was worth every headache to finally have this figured out. \n\n  \nPerhaps it's too soon to be writing this out here because it's only just the beginning but I wanted to connect with other entrepreneurs who've been on similar journeys. The road gets lonely sometimes, and hearing other people's stories - the wins, the failures, the pivot moments - that's what keeps me going.  \n  \nI’d love to read your stories about how you became or plan to become an entrepreneur. Cheers!",

      "selftext": "I’m going to share a story with you about how the company I work for actually started, before it was a proper SaaS.\n\nNot the founder, not the dev. I work close to product and growth at a SaaS that turns Google Maps into usable lead lists. Seeing the \"behind the scenes\" here has been a serious reality check.\n\nBefore there was an automated platform, the founders were coming off a failed project. They were burned out from building features that looked great on paper but didn't sell. So for this new idea, they made a simple rule: Don’t code. Just sell.\n\nFor the first few months, the product was just a manual service. They found people who needed local business data, and when someone asked for a list, they ran scripts manually on a laptop. They cleaned the Excel files by hand, line by line, and sent them via email with a simple PayPal invoice.\n\nIt sounds counter-intuitive for a tech company, but this manual grind is exactly what saved the business. If the data was wrong, the customer complained instantly. They didn't need to analyze user behavior to know what was broken, they felt it in the inbox. It also proved that people weren't paying for a slick tool, they were paying for the result. If a customer is willing to wait 24 hours for a manual email, you know you have a real business. Plus, those early sales literally funded the first months of actual development.\n\nThe automated dashboard was only built once the manual work became physically impossible to handle.\n\nThe lesson from inside the machine is clear: The SaaS was built to scale a solution that already worked, not to try and find a problem with a shiny UI. If what you’re doing right now feels ugly, slow, and unscalable, you’re probably exactly where you need to be.",

          "body": "This is such a real post and honestly refreshing to read.\n\nThe \"don't code, just sell\" rule is harsh but it makes you face the only question that matters: will someone actually pay for this? Not would they maybe use it if it were free, but will they literally give you money.\n\nWhat gets me is how the manual process wasn't just validation, it was education. Every angry email about bad data, every question about what fields they needed, every \"can you also include...\" request. That's signal you just can't get from analytics or surveys. You're learning what the product needs to be because you're doing the work yourself, feeling every problem firsthand.\n\nThe timing thing is huge too: \"The automated dashboard was only built once the manual work became physically impossible to handle.\" Most founders do the opposite. They build the whole thing before knowing if anyone wants it. By the time you're drowning in manual work, you know exactly which parts to automate first because you're living the pain.\n\nThere's also something powerful about being willing to do unscalable things. It shows early customers you're serious, that this isn't just a side project that might disappear. Someone who will manually clean a spreadsheet at 11pm to get you your data actually cares about solving your problem.\n\nOne thing though: this works great for services where the value is immediate and tangible, like data or clear results. It's trickier for products where the value is in the tool itself or needs network effects. But even then, the core idea holds. Find the simplest way to deliver the value and see if anyone actually cares.",

I can imagine that initial manual grind felt quite demoralising at times, but it turned out to be the exact path your founders needed.\n\nYou're right that sometimes the \"ugly, slow, and unscalable\" stage is actually the most valuable. When you're so close to the problem, it's easy to feel like the solution has to be sleek and automated from the start. But those early manual workflows are often where you surface the true pain points and prove there's a market.\n\nIf this feels like the current phase for your product, I'd encourage you to lean into it. What specific aspects of the manual work are the most illuminating? Where do customers seem most engaged or frustrated? Observing those raw interactions can give you invaluable insights that may get lost once things are fully automated.\n\nJust remember to pace yourself. Avoid the temptation to over-optimise before the core foundation is solid. As long as you're learning and getting paid, the \"ugliness\" is a feature, not a bug. What's one small step you could take next to make that manual process just a little bit smoother?",

      "selftext": "I started my business in April 2025, so officially less than 12 months. Started negative and used my credit card to fund the business.\n\nLittle back story about myself. I’m a carpenter by trade. Always been entrepreneurial and had an interest in business/making money. Didn’t come from money. Had a few small businesses over the years, some failed, others just weren’t viable. \n\n2025 started rough for myself. I experienced severe anxiety for the first time. Spent 2024 hustling and trading. Managed to build up an account to multiple 6 figs but got greedy and lost majority of it at the end of the year. Even lost my finances 10k that she trusted me with. I had to come clean and admit what I had done.. it was one of the hardest conversations of my life. \n\nThat leads me into the business, obviously having lost a significant amount of money, still had a job. I had to figure out ways to earn more to somehow get myself out of the hole I dug.\n\nSo I started doing a few cash jobs on the side, outside of work hours.\n\nInstalling basic shower screens, found work from apps where people posted jobs they needed done and I could quote/compete with others. \n\nAfter a few months of doing a few jobs a week. I could see there was profit to be made and the jobs had a quick turn over. 1 job in 45mins in some cases with profit of 50-60% \n\nSo I built a website with the help of AI, very basic, stock images and a few of images from\n\nI had done. Then I setup a Google ads campaign. Very basic, just let Google guide me. (I did have some previous experience with Google ads). \n\nWithin 10mins of the campaign being live. I had a form enquiry, I actually couldn’t believe it. Here I was laying in bed. I showed my fiancé and she brushed it off but I got excited, thinking if I can get a lead from $25 campaign.. imagine how many I can get if I increase my budget.\n\nWell the next day I increased to $50 a day.. and sure enough the leads increased. Here I was at work, phone ringing and emails coming through. Booking in as many jobs as I could. I could earn my weeks wage in a day - so I had to make a decision and speak to my fiance. Knowing I had a secure income, 150k a year and just lost a heap of money a few months prior. I didn’t expect her to support me, but she did.\n\nSo I took the leap. It was hard work, I was doing everything and sure enough had no idea how to run a business. Constantly learning, I had no idea what was involved and the amount of work behind the scenes. \n\nFast forward to now. I now have 2 employees. We are on track to do $1M revenue in the first year of business with 20% net profit. I still don’t have a factory, working out of the garage for as long as possible. \n\nThe goal is to expand to other states but first build the business and systems, test and ensure it’s a well oiled machine.

      "selftext": "At the start of 2025 I got into an online business model. For months I was just learning, watching videos, studying etc. I’ve always been better at talking than doing, but I really did understand the model inside and out.\n\nBy September I finally took the leap and it actually worked. Within two weeks I was earning, and in November I made over $20,000. For the first time I felt like \"oh damn im actually gonna make it\"\n\nBut then I messed up... I lost more than half of it because of a platform policy violation. Honestly, I could've avoided it but it is what it is.\n\nAround the same time, a guy I’d been talking to since February basically disappeared from my life. We had over 100k messages between us and talked every single day about this business. He started building a tool, I helped him, and we became partners. I genuinely thought we were building something together. Then he found loopholes in our contract and cut me out to work with someone else.\n\nSo within a few weeks, I lost a lot of money and someone I thought had my back.\n\nI’m 18 and still live with my parents. I pay my share of the bills and I have enough saved to get through 2026 without a job, so I’m not in danger or anything. But mentally, I’ve been stuck. I wake up around 1pm, watch YouTube, play games, tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve fixed a few small habits, but I just can’t get myself to actually work again.\n\nAt night it’s worse. I stay up until 3am because when I try to go to bed I either feel lonely or my brain won’t shut up. I do have a girlfriend, and honestly, all I want long term is to be able to provide for her one day. That’s what drives me deep down. But right now, I just feel like I lost my momentum and don’t know how to get it back.\n\nI’m not looking for hustle clichés or “just grind harder” advice. I’m just wondering how people get themselves moving again after losing money, trust, and confidence all at once.\n\n**TL;DR:** Built an online business at 18, made good money, lost most of it due to a mistake, then got cut out by a partner I trusted. Now I’m stuck, barely working, sleeping badly, and trying to figure out how to start again.",

Put all that to good use and start lifting weights, do it for 90 days and see how you feel. \n\nIt won't really change anything, but I promise you will feel better. Cardio is good too, I just lift, it helps so much just a lift heavy, makes you feel really good afterwards. Do it everyday, because every day you will get a boost from it. Try to do it first thing in the morning, but just do it every single day even if it's not like a huge thing. I spend about 30 to 45 minutes in the gym everyday, it ain't life-changing, it's enough to boost me through the day. \n\nBetter than any drugs I ever tried.",

I'm assuming that it's been a good amount of time since your lifestyle has gotten worse. So to fix it, you have to fix the environment first. You don't have to change everything at once or keep a separate time for \"work\". My real advice is to change the place where you live. If possible, just move to another room with a different kind of setup which is minimal. With a new environment, your brain would allow you to let go of current habits and allow you to build new good ones. If you can't change your room, just change the place of furniture. Just make a change. That could also mean minimalising your room by removing unnecessary things. Regardless, best wishes!",

Some things are just scars you learn to live with. You can’t make anything ‘right’ in your heart and head now. Don’t focus too hard on making ‘peace’ with it or you learn to take advantage and move forward while stepping over others now that you feel you broke the cherry on it. So no, you don’t want to just feel better right now because then you’re becoming like those people.\n\nYou’re talking about being appreciative and showing gratitude. Giving back when you’ve taken. Those are beautiful. But since those things take time, you also have to logically understand that your feelings will therefore have to wait. You’re not going to do anything for him today or tomorrow. It might be years.\n\nBut if you keep that feeling as additional motivation and use it to guide future actions - you’ll find yourself more deeply valuing future relationships in the moment. You’ll make more decisions that reflect these values. This painful lesson will help you develop a stronger character going forward. \n\nWe aren’t meant to just be happy and peaceful all the time. To not have trouble and pain means to not be living. So live more intentionally now that you’ve had these lessons. Don’t try and rush healing and growing just because it’s uncomfortable.",

Maybe instead of living in regret start appreciating where you have come to and look back on how your work, ingenuity and dedication got you where you are today.  Financial and mental support is a privilege to appreciate and maybe consider how your self pity would be an insult to all that support. There are many ways to repay that privilege. Most likely I’ve disappointed someone as we are all human and none of us perfect. Success comes with dedication. Thats your legacy (if you see it that way). If you need to pay him back then do it.

Both in actual money (glad I had some saved up for situations like this) and **in team morale.**\n\nStudies have shown that a toxic \"all star\" that damages team morale never makes up for that in sales....a team is a team for a reason...they can do more than one person ever can. All star salespeople are the worst and if they are truly so good they can teach everyone else to be on their level or they likely need fired or moved to a new position.\n\n  \nI bet part of the reason your sales are up now is because your employees are happier and putting in more work and presenting themselves better (smiling more etc) and working as an actual team....",

For example, I've never worked in a restaurant where we didn't get free pop &amp; a shift meal. That was never tracked and I'm sure a shift meal went out some someone's friends now &amp; again, but the owner kept a hawk's eye for abuse of the privilege.\n\nWe don't really do annual reviews like a lot of larger places do, but we do have regular cost of living increases for staff. When I sit them down to discuss that, at the very end I ask if they have any comments/concerns/complaints/frustrations/pain points/whatever with their job or the business, in general. I make it clear that there's no discipline on this and that their answer has no bearing on the raise we just discussed. I want real candid thoughts.\n\nThe point is, I can't trust people to come forward with some of that themselves, for fear they'll rock the boat too much. This gives them a chance to express their thoughts in the grey areas, where it's more opinion or custom than actual rule breaking or illegality. \n\nBecause I want to find out things like what you just described before it becomes a problem.",

It ALL started from me calling them randomly when my office air went out at 1PM on a hot July day. I called after seeing their reviews and the dispatch said they wouldn't be able to get out to me for another 24 hours. Anyway I go to leave around 6pm I hear some banging on the wall and two of their guys are out there. I said \"I thought you weren't coming until tomorrow!\" Their answer \"Well we were on our way home and was passing your office anyway we figured we might as well take a look\" I was locked in from that day. They were my HVAC guys from here on.\n\nMany years down the road I buy a house and the AC went down and they came out and said I needed a 3 ton (3100 sq ft) furnace and AC unit (I knew it was time). I asked them on three different discussions \"Are you SURE I don't need a 5 ton?\" I was told no over and over. Well, the day came and two service techs showed up went to work and I asked them \"You guys sure I don't need a 5 ton?\" at this point they're installing the furnace. Suddenly they come down and call me over. \"Well.....you need a 5 ton\" I laughed and said \"See!\" they said \"Well we gotta go get the 5 ton units and take the furnace back out so we will be here longer.\" I asked what kinda pizza they liked.\n\nSo they go to leave and I say \"So whats it going to cost me now?\" he looked at me and said \"Nothing! This is on us\". I will never use another HVAC company and use them for my commercial property. They always come out quick and are honest. So yes once you do right by a solid customer they will  call you every time. To date I have probably paid out $13k to them over the years and there is NO ONE else I will call going forward.\n\nI will NEVER leave them and I will tell you something else watching them has enforced my standards at my own business. We can always do better and learn. I know how they made me feel so I want to do that for my clients as well. You're doing it the right way, don't ever stop doing it the right way because  there's not many of us out there doing it the right way.",

We've been in business for 18 years and I have processed a good many state-mandated wage garnishments for child support so I am well acquainted with the process.\n\n  \nThis week I was served papers by a process server for a Continuing Writ of Garnishment against one of my employees.  This is not child support related but rather a debt owed to a bank for about $3,500.00.  The papers were served by a law firm and have been filed with our local court.  These read very differently from the regular child-support garnishments I am used to.  This garnishment letter states that my failure to execute all documents and as well as begin garnishing wages in a timely manner could result in the full debt obligation being charged to us (our company).  \n\nI am directed to fill out the paperwork enclosed, expedite return to the law firm and file a copy with our local clerk of court within 20 days of receipt.\n\nAnd the fee I can charge for all the work - $17.  State of Florida allows a $5 admin fee for the first payroll garnishment and $2 each payroll after.  I have to pay for the expedited return shipping of docs to the law firm.  I have to pay for the filing fee with the clerk of court.  And $17 does not begin to cover the amount of administrative time that will be applied to this endeavor.\n\nIt absolutely BOGGLES my mind that I am expected to bear the costs for this person's inability to pay their bills or handle their personal finances.  Not only that but if I fail to respond/take action quickly, I could be responsible for HIS debt!!!  \n\nI am upset and outraged.  I have enough expenses and worries being a small business owner.  Now I have to also handle/solve the debt issues of those I hire??  Insane.",

They demand a settlement payment because we're infringing on their name/trademark/whatever, citing several laws, and that we change our business's name immediately or they will sue us in federal court of blah, blah, blah . . .\n\nWell, one partner was fretting about how we were going to come up with the cash to pay them off and change everything about the business. We send the letter to our legal counsel and ask what we have to do, what our obligations are, etc. The lawyer sends back his draft of a response letter with the legalese version of telling them to politely fuck off. Our lawyer advises us that we don't do business in the same states so they have no standing. We never heard from them again, but we do occasionally get calls from that area from people that found us online.

I worked there through the housing market collapse of 2008. I saw first hand how predatory banks would get. Charging people $35 overdraft fees per transaction regardless of the amount of the transaction. There was a cap of five overdraft fees a day before the collapse. They raised it to ten overdraft fees max per day during the crisis. So I had to justify these fees to customers by saying ‘well we paid for the item’ or ‘you didn’t manage your account and so it cost us money to receive and reverse this charge so here’s a fee for each’. All while many people just had less than a hundred dollars of charges that brought them negative - then getting $350 of fees per day, plus fees for the account staying negative. \nAll it takes is a mortgage payment, a hospital bill that was paid, to get so negative, then a mountain of fees for the ‘burden’ of having this negative account on the books and you’re done. Maybe you don’t pay it as a protest or whatever. But then they’ve got the money and resources on their side to pursue - as they’re doing now. It’s not child support. They got got by a for profit institution. \n\nNo matter how this person got here.

Many small business owners find this crazy the first time it happens, especially since the language of those commandments sounds intentionally threatening.\n\nThat said (and without diminishing the unfairness of the situation), in Florida these types of garnishments are not optional, and the employer only faces risk if you don't respond or comply with their requests. In practice, if you fill out the form correctly, submit it on time, and follow the process, you don't end up being responsible for the debt. The system is designed to force you to cooperate, not to transfer the obligation to you… even if the wording is awful.\n\nI completely agree that the administrative fee is absurd and doesn't reflect the actual time or costs (especially postage and filing). Unfortunately, the state views it as a \"civic duty\" of the employer, not as a service you provide voluntarily.\n\n\nIf you don't already, it's usually worthwhile to have a standard internal procedure (checklist + templates) for these situations. This reduces the administrative burden and stress when they arise. It shouldn't be necessary, but it helps protect you.\n\n\nIn short: your frustration is valid; the system is clumsy with small businesses.

She had a stall at her school’s end-of-term event and asked me to help her with sales. My son came along to help and, for the first time, saw a small amount of money turn into a pile of cash as we sold out in two hours. He was fascinated by how money is made.\n\nWhat happened next:\nA week later, he asked me for a drone. I told him I wouldn't buy it for him. After he realized I wasn’t going to budge, he asked if he could start a business to earn the money himself, inspired by the day at the cupcake stall.\nHe convinced my sister to teach him how to make chocolates. He invested ₹300 of his own pocket money into molds and chocolate compound. He and his cousin made 100 chocolates and, before we even woke up the next morning, they had sold them all for ₹5 each, making ₹500. They have since bought more supplies and sold even more.\n\nThe advice I need:\nWhile I am very happy and proud of what he has achieved, I’m honestly not sure how to handle this.\n-Should I fully support this and let him continue?\n-Should I be setting specific rules for him?\n-How do I manage a child of this age starting a \"business\" venture?\n-Any other advice you might have for me?\nI’m looking for perspectives on the best way to guide him through this.",

Keep it clearly framed as a learning project, not a responsibility or expectation. Let him run it when he wants, pause when he’s bored, and stop entirely if it stops being fun.\n\nSetting simple rules helps. Things like fixed hours, adult supervision for money and food safety, and a clear split between saving, spending, and reinvesting. This keeps it educational instead of chaotic.\n\nUse it as a teaching tool. Talk through basic ideas like costs, profit, and why he doesn’t get to keep every rupee as “free money.” You can even introduce a rule where part of the profit goes toward the drone, part goes into savings, and part is for fun or sharing.\n\nMost importantly, protect his childhood. Don’t scale it, don’t optimize it, don’t turn him into a mini entrepreneur. The real win here isn’t the drone, it’s that he learned he can create something, take initiative, and follow through.

Nothing bad will come of it, but he can pick himself up and jump on the next fascination if all goes downhill (hoping for his explosive success, but life does happen). If he comes to you with a problem offer to help, make sure he knows he has you as a parachute, and by all means give insights and support, but truly encourage him to make his own decisions and make or break things. It'll be a hard at times, and he'll inevitably want to do things differently than you would, but the mindset he's building now will carry him so so far. I honestly believe that being comfortable with the idea of \"I might fail and that's okay\" is the biggest lesson that's learned too late by most, and he's in such a privileged spot to learn it early. I promise you this won't be his last attempt at this either, just keep fostering that idea that it's possible to enjoy the bads just as much as the goods\n\nHonestly, I'd see this more of a character and bond building exercise for both of you than anything.

Okay on to my story. \n\nMy oldest son and his next oldest brother (we have 8 kiddos) are 10 and 8 years of age. I am in the trades and have been for a while but over time moved up to more of a managerial position and learned the business side and loved it. My passion for this spawned a small side business that is essentially a handyman style ordeal and I have 2 guys that work as needed for me and I keep them fairly busy, they are paid by job not hourly and older gentleman. One day we had a customer ask if we could fix up her dog house, it was trashed and falling apart so we rebuilt it. My oldest son and I knocked it out pretty quick for building portion then he and my younger son painted it and all the small details. Naturally I paid them for their work and my God did it light a fire.\n\nTyler(oldest) Mav(younger) came to me about a week later and asked to borrow some paper and pencils to draw up some stuff. Low and behold this little entrepreneur has come up with a full blown business building dog houses and play houses and made a whole layout of plans for about 6 different setups ( they were highly crude and made no sense on layout but hey it was a start!) They showed it to me with biggest smile and said they wanted to do a business building these for folks and called it 'Sweet T and Lil Mav's Construction'  it was a cool little run, didnt last long unfortunately they petered out quick, but it was ridiculously fun while it lasted. My oldest still occasionally does little stuff like that but the younger one is much more introverted and lost interest fast. \n\nAnyways ultimately I say let that man cook and conquer the market !",

If you use the drone to make even a penny an any way shape or form in the US you have to take another expensive and complicated test. In the US its called a part 107.

Titles, pay, and external validation disappear overnight, and there’s nothing immediate to replace them. When you’re early in building something, there’s no scoreboard yet, so it’s easy to feel like you’re floating without proof that the decision was right.\n\nWhat you said about the awkward middle really matters. That stretch where the old life is gone but the new one hasn’t solidified yet is mentally exhausting. You’re taking on risk, uncertainty, and constant decision-making without the dopamine hits that a stable career provides. It’s not surprising that nights get long and doubts get loud.\n\nPeople who come out stronger on the other side usually find ways to separate self-worth from short-term outcomes. Instead of asking “does this look successful yet,” they anchor to progress, skills gained, and control over direction. It’s a quieter kind of confidence, but a more durable one.\n\nYou’re not weak for feeling this. You’re in the part most people never see because they turn back before it passes.

          "body": "&gt;Is there a reason why he would be doing this?\n\nPlenty. Doing this means he can decide when (or if) to pay you, so he doesn't have to factor it in much on his expense schedule. Basically, you're low-priority to him (and yes, you are being disrespected).\n\nIn addition, there is the [time value of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money) - the longer a payment can be delayed, the less it's worth in real-world value. Getting paid in January is worth more to you than having the same amount paid in September, and likewise delaying a payment means the customer is paying you less in value even if they're paying the same amount in raw numbers.\n\nTo mitigate this, you may want to look at including items in your contracts, such as late payment penalties that increase over time (and, at some point, become extreme enough to trigger payment), base rate increases (or loss of access to discounts) for customers who regularly pay late, or simply declining credit (including n30/n90 etc) for customers who have a history of late payments.\n\nIn addition, move everyone over to the new contract at the end of the current one - this guy should not be able to 'grandfather' themselves in just because they're a long-term customer; what they actually are is a long-term *deadbeat*.",

It's becoming pretty obvious to me that he would probably be working at 0.5-0.7x of the speed any other employee would be working at. This is my third employee I've hired (second employee I currently have). How do I navigate letting him go?

          "body": "I’m not familiar with Cali laws but should be similar issues like NY which have strong employee protections.\n\n1. Setup an employee manual. Have your employment attorney set that up for you, it is state and city specific. Don’t go cheap here, it will be pricey to set it up for first time. It will cost you a lot more if you don’t set it up correctly. \n\n2. Setup probationary period. I recommend it just under when unemployment insurance kicks in. For NY, it’s 6 months. We have ours set at 5 months and 29 days. That means, you can terminate whenever you want without dinging your UI premium.\n\n3. Setup employee duties and KPI’s. It must be clearly  stated and listed in your employee manual. Failure to meet KPI = retraining, sanction, then eventual termination.\n\n4. Evaluation - new hire are evaluated weekly for first 8 weeks. They need to know whether they’re meeting KPI’s or not. The written evaluation with KPI metrics is what legally protects you. Employee may claim any false statements, but a weekly evaluation with poor KPI and signed by both you and the employee, that is your proof that you terminated due to poor KPI, not due to whatever issue they claim. Depending on nature of the job, after 8 weeks, we do bi weekly then monthly. We switch to quarterly for all employees after probation.\n\nMost small business owners don’t do evaluations, and find quarterly to be a pain. You want to do this so you can also give bonus and rewards based on KPI’s. We give staff bonuses for monthly KPI’s and quarterly KPI. It also shows to the employee that you are the captain of the ship, employees want a leader. Most owners are not leaders therefore there's nobody manning the helm. That invites employees to start getting away with anything, such as theft, time clock theft, PTO abuse, etc. Quarterly eval and business meetings help reinforce your business vision and goals, which boost morale and focus employee energy to a productive goal.\n\nOnce you list KPI’s are not being met, give a verbal warning. Document it in their file, date, time, what you said and their response. Email yourself for time stamp proof. Employees get two verbals then written reprimands.\n\nAs the old saying is true, fire fast, hire slow. I’d talk with your employment attorney quick, prep to terminate that employee soon.\n\nFuture hiring, create a more stringent hiring system to ensure they can do the KPI’s. That employee should never have made pass the screening phase, definitely shouldn’t have made pass the interview test which should include testing the KPI’s, and if they somehow made it through and not meeting KPI, terminate within 2 weeks or sooner.",

Also in my business, we make the best products in the market and it still applies. You could make the best product possible and 1% of people will complain. You need to accept this fact.

We spent too long trying to make the perfect product, listings, images etc. You learn more by just doing. We also know that as much as 30% of everything we list will fail. So we will remove it from Amazon FBA after time (this applies to any business). \n\n4-The right people are more important than anything else. Do you have the right mix? Do you complement each other?

I’ve been a barista for about 8 years now. I spent about 5 1/2 years In a local coffee shop and almost 3 years at a huge corporation ahem.. Starbucks which sucks and isn’t real coffee but I needed the benefits. So I have plenty of barista experience. I have been a supervisor/manager at both places. The small business i handled all of the inventory, did a lot of the marketing, a lot of the drink creating and spent a lot of my time and effort there. So I know how internally a coffee shop works and runs too but having my own business seems intimidating. I live in a very populated city, where coffee is a huge demand I’ve found a location I’d love to rent that fits the moody/ witchy vibe I’m going for (garage door, loft, rustic, dark exterior vibe) it’s apart of shopping/event center which I think would be perfect for foot traffic and exposure. There’s no coffee competition, just a hair salon, tattoo shop, bakery, pizza shop, brewery and some boutiques. I’ve done a lot of the research and have calculated the price of all of the things I’d need to do and have, my question I guess is what’s next? How do you make it happen? Is it worth it? ",

Keep all your costs low, and start with skeleton staff... and add more staff in when you need them,\n... it's ok to be busy and have people wait for a good product as long as they can see you are being efficient... if they are standing around waiting while staff are wandering around chatting or being a prima Madonna with the coffee machine they'll be gone. Don't buy the 'best' equipment, or have the best fit out but make sure it is functional, efficient and looks good. Make the coffee prices competitive but make sure you charge for every extra, and have lots of visually appealing grab and go style treats and food well displayed near the point of sale. And also try and budget for custom printed takeaway cups. Hopefully you are a good barista that is clean and efficient, has a good eye for extraction and making timing and grind adjustments and can effortlessly make silky smooth milks.... Because remember you must lead from the front and set a high standard for your staff. Good luck.",

The world is more complex now and a term such as passive income doesn't really explain things or cover the entire breadth of all possible types of passive income.\n\nA better word is simply 'work'. Business takes work and it's always a gamble. The gamble on some types of businesses take longer to pay off or see a return. But lets say content creation as an example - this can take years to pay off but when you reach a certain point, you can call it passive income (to an extent).\n\nThis ties very heavily into the platforms someone chooses. If you are a streamer then your income is almost 100% tied to performing streams. If you do youtube then your income relies on you staying relevant so that your content is promoted. If you stop, your income wont stop immediately but its still tied to putting out content.\n\nI'm not saying this is a better business model than any other, but it does have unique advantages. You can quit youtube for a whole month (or longer) if you build up enough content to release on a schedule. People do this all the time. During this holiday or time off, the income is passive.

Just over two months ago, I launched a side project that’s quickly showing potential, and I’d love some advice on how to grow it.\n\n**The concept:**\n\n• I host regular board game nights at public venues.\n\n• Entry fee is $5 cash per person for the entire evening.\n\n• People can come alone or with friends, I place them on a table, they play games (not the niche tabletop ones, more social party games), and meet new folks.\n\n**Current setup:**\n\n• I’ve built a group on a popular social app (300+ members have joined organically, though only a fraction attend these events).\n\n• So far, attendance per event has ranged from as little as 2 ppl, to as high as 23 people (although these are the extremes, I have an average attendance of 7 ppl, and am consistently trending higher in recent events). I also happen to have a pretty good return rate, and there are now 6-8 regulars.\n\n• Upfront costs: \\~$547.22 for several board games, a few bits and bobs (pens, name badges, etc) and the app membership.\n\n• Income: \\~$645.00 in total (210 the first month, and 435 the second); I’m now officially in profit.\n\n• Venue is free (local bars or food courts), so no additional costs on my part there.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n• I want to grow attendance (30 attendees per session would be solid) and attract specific crowds (young people, 20-30, as well as more women to balance it out) and better leverage social media platforms.\n\n**Questions for you (and please share any useful advice):**\n\n• How would you scale something like this without raising prices? The $5 fee matches local board game café pricing and I want to keep it the same.\n\n• As the group grows, I'm aware that hosting duties will become more and more complicated, but I'm still unsure how to proceed - should I pay someone to help me host?\n\n• I’m struggling to reconcile my financial objectives with my willingness to make sure everyone is having a good time; basically, I’m very picky with who I invite. Most of my promo so far has been done through subreddits for the town I live in and Facebook groups – I always do a background check on people first, and have a quick chat with them to gauge the kind of person they are. I do this to avoid having problematic profiles (creeps, scammers, intolerant people, you name it) but this comes at an extra effort, and also highly limits the clients I get (I must lose 50% of potential customers with this system). I know it’s a stupid question even before I ask it, but have some of you found a good way to filter out the bad weeds in a more efficient way, or do you just take the risk to have these sorts of clients anyways?\n\n• I've had some suggestions to use a subscription system, but sounds quite complicated to set up logistically, and I like the idea of people having the flexibility of paying per session. Are there any real upsides to this system?\n\n• Creative ideas to reach more people? I'm struggling to find people in their twenties - it seems most user pools I'm targeting have 30 year olds...where are all the twenty year olds?? Same goes for finding women – very few of them seem to respond to my posts…I’m trying Instagram and TikTok which I hope might attract these crowds, but growth is painfully slow.\n\n• Anything else I should keep in mind moving forward? This is my first entrepreneurial project so I’d really appreciate any insights :)",

Either way they will appreciate the extra customers walking in the door. Just a thought. When I bartended at a brewery we had a group that would come in every Wednesday and play big board games together, I always thought it was really fun",

          "body": "I hate to be a downer but I'm not sure this makes sense as a business. It may make more sense simply as a fun thing that you enjoy, where the entry fees defray some of your costs. As a business, you've made $100 in profits over two months while ignoring the cost of your own time, which includes hosting the game sessions themselves as well as all the time you spend promoting them and recruiting and screening attendees. If you're doing this on a larger scale then you'll also probably want liability insurance. And a larger scale also probably means it's not always you who's personally running the game nights and doing the screenings, so you'll need to pay somebody. Even if it's just you, you should include your own notional \"salary\" in your figures in order to be realistic and not fool yourself - your time is not free. Try to estimate how much you're ultimately earning per hour of effort, after considering all your costs.\n\nTo make this work, I think you need to find ways to get more income per session. $5/person seems really low. Maybe buy games at wholesale and sell physical copies during sessions at retail prices: people like instant gratification. Sell game-related T-shirts and merch. Charge a small fee to indie game companies for including/promoting their games at your sessions. Create a newsletter or social media account for the group with affiliate links to where people can purchase the games that they played, so you earn a commission. Strike a deal with a bar or restaurant to get some percentage of the tab or a flat fee if your session brings in a minimum number of extra people on a normally slow day. Offer a membership option for something like $15/month as an alternative to paying as you go - many people are lazy and will sign up but then come rarely/never.",

          "body": "Good for you. I'm not sure how long you will be able to continue charging. I attend a weekly game meetup. It's free and there are anywhere from 25 to 40 ppl in attendance. It has been going for 13 years. I would be worried at some point a few of your attendees will swap contact info and say, \"hey, let's just start meeting at X and skip the entrance fee\". I recommend introducing at least one new game a month. Keep a real close eye on BGG's lists to stay current on your game selection. This might keep people coming back. All the game stores in my area have free weekly game nights, and game libraries ranging from 10s to 100s. So you need to determine what sets your paid event apart and better than the alternatives.\n\n20s is the wrong demographic IMO. I've been to boardgame conventions and boardgame meetups. The age demographic is more like 35 to 65. I'm guessing about 75% male to female. Also, college kids are pretty savvy using social media to coordinate and would also quickly recognize they don't need to pay someone to play a game. \n\nIf you are a really good story teller or theater geek, I recommend you look into Blood on the Clocktower and start hosting BotC events. If you get really good, people would definitely pay to attend and most would be regulars. But it doesn't scale well. 10 people at $10 each for 3 hours is not really worth it unless you love it.",

But it could be done on rotation basis, adding more venues as you find them. \n\nNext is turning the event into more of an event. Making it more enticing, enough for people to get out of the house, maybe bring some of their friends and plan for it instead of taking it for granted.\n\nIf every games day/night is the same old, people are going to think they can always go to another event.

Now you can do a rotation so each event is different and people who miss out can eventually 'try' it. \n\nYou can combine the above with additional themes, dressing up/cosplay, specific games, awards and prizes, etc to make each event even more enticing. \n\nUltimately you want to target people who have money to spend.

They've been going for a few years now, and it's usually packed on the weekends.\n\nThey're called \"Luck Factory Games\" in Concord, NC: [https://luckfactorygames.com](https://luckfactorygames.com)",

Be open when people need to buy things...i.e. - after 5 or 6 pm.  Most people work 8 or 9 to 5 or 6 so they might need to stop by AFTER or BEFORE work to buy supplies.  Also SUNDAY.  I can't tell you how many times contractors need to buy some lumber before heading to their job, but the local lumber store doesn't open until 8 or they're closed at 5:30 or they aren't open Sunday or they close early on Saturday.  Hence, they go to Home Fart-hole, which them becomes the default because they can't rely on the local store to be open.  Also, management needs to be THERE all the time.  No management = terrible customer service, stealing, embezzling, etc.  And competent management is vital, too.  If you don't know how to manage, get out of the way.  Pump up the fact you're a LOCAL business, FAMILY run and owned!!  So many people would love to avoid Home Crapo.  Or Lowes (quality).   Etc.  If you can offer something that your competition can't, or won't, do it!  I know people that go to Les Schwab (ewwwwwww!) for their free popcorn!!!  Seriously.  If there's a special service or product line or something that sets you apart, try it!  Maybe a store kitty!  or doggo!  Or you'll load their lumber for them!

Right now interest rates are at an all time high. So people who finance home construction/renovation are just not doing it right now. This is prolly 90% of your audience. People who pay cash for home construction/renovation are likely not messing with small local lumber yards.\n\nAlso, the economy in general is super crappy right now. I build websites for small businesses. I'm finding that in general all of my clients across multiple industry segments have 20-50% lower web traffic this year when compared to last year. This directly translates into fewer phone calls and as a result lower income. All of my contractor/construction clients have canceled their websites this year. So I think this is your audience.\n\nWithout knowing exactly where you are, I would suspect a substantial portion of your historic clientele either own a small business or are directly employed by one.\n\nHere's my advice, your family has likely spent decades building relationships with your community. Just because they're not spending money right now doesn't mean they wont when the interest rates come back down. Which let's be honest will happen when Powell is replaced in May. This year's gonna be rough for you, but if you can find a way to cut costs and hold on, eventually there will be a recovery, and if you have decades of history with your community you'll be at the forefront of the local recovery.

Renting out specialized equipment can have a high ROI.\n* **Propane Refills &amp; Screen Repair:** These are \"errand\" services.

          "body": "Sounds like the initiative would be a strategic sale, or a sale to some youngblood with hopes and dreams. The separate kitchen doesn't come with the business, but can a contract be put in place? What relevance is the full-time baker if they (presumably) work in the separate kitchen?\n\nIt sounds like the sellers are banking on an attractive location, established reputation, and \"could make\" $X level. You don't pay them for the incremental increase you have to pursue, so that last factor is irrelevant. My thoughts are the key, at least in the short term, is ensuring continuity of product availability and quality, particularly if you don't already have ovens or a third-party baker. Take a long, hard look at that part of the equation. Would your COGS be commensurate as what they were doing when they were, effectively, baking in-house?\n\nBeyond that, I would have to assume the location is a large part of the intangible value given retail bakers don't typically have much else that's readily long-lived and transferrable. And I'd get a sense of the sellers' intentions once they offload this location. If they're so good that they can forget this location and just start another near or at their bakery, and simply market themselves as \"We moved to...\" and undercut your prospective operations, then all you'd really be receiving is their stand at a historic location.",

      "selftext": "I own a business selling material for and building residential structures.\n\nAll orders require a deposit to place an order. If someone wants to cancel, I give their deposit back about 99% of the time, but our contract states deposits are refundable solely at our discretion and there are no guarantees a deposit will be refunded. Generally the only reason I don't give refunds if the customer is rude or if it's been a very long time. In this case, it's been about six months.\n\nThe order was for about $10k, and we collected about $1,100.\n\nOur orders are typically filled in 2-4 weeks, but this customer was taking a long time to get his installation site prepared for the garage, then he called in to say the order needed to be placed on hold without an explanation. A few months later we follow up to see if he wants to leave it on hold or cancel the order, but we can't get reach him. A couple more months go by and the customer is reaching out wanting to cancel.\n\nI told him we can absolutely get the order cancelled, but we're only going to refund his deposit if his permit was denied due to issues outside of his control (the contract he signed is an older contract and states everything is non refundable unless the permit is denied and he is unable to remedy the situation). I told him if it's anything other than the permit being denied, then we can cancel it and give him in store credit for what he's already paid.\n\nI'm going to have to call this guy on Monday and tell him we're not giving him his money back, and whilst I don't necessarily feel bad about it due to how long it's been, the inability to reach him, failure to provide an explanation, etc, I do still feel some anxiety with actually having to tell him. It's my business, I own it, so at the end of the day it's my call. If I was just an employee and enforcing someone else's policy, then it'd be different.\n\nHow did you guys start getting used to being okay with being strict with your policy without feeling bad about things?\n\nEDIT: I just want to clarify, when I say \"rude\" people won't get a refund, I really mean excessively rude. I can handle cranky people who are short with me, but I draw the line at personal attacks/intentional disrespect.",

          "body": "I don’t think it’s just you, this is a very common experience with business brokers, especially on the smaller deals. A lot of them aren’t really acting like salespeople, they’re acting like gatekeepers whose main job is to not screw up the listing they already have.\n\nThe reason everything feels so locked down is usually seller paranoia mixed with weak qualification systems. Sellers are terrified their employees, landlords, or competitors will find out they’re selling, so brokers overcorrect by hiding even basic info. Instead of filtering serious buyers properly, they default to NDAs, questionnaires, and forced calls because that’s the only process they know.\n\nThe irony is that many brokers are also undertrained and overloaded. They blast generic auto replies because they’re juggling too many listings and most inquiries are tire kickers. When you ask for numbers before a call, some take it as a threat to their control of the process rather than a reasonable request. The “threatening to drop you” behavior usually means they’re insecure about either the deal quality or their own value.\n\nBusiness brokerage is very different from real estate because there’s no standardized disclosure culture. In real estate, rent and square footage don’t reveal who the seller is. In a small deli, revenue numbers can basically identify the business if you’re local, so brokers treat them like state secrets even when it hurts deal flow.\n\nIf you want less friction, you usually have better luck going one layer off the big listing sites. Accountants, commercial lenders, local attorneys, and even restaurant suppliers often know who’s quietly looking to sell and will make warm intros without the theatrics. Another option is dealing directly with owners through local networking or old-school outreach, which avoids brokers entirely, though you lose some protection.\n\nThere are good brokers out there, but they tend to work on larger, cleaner deals and don’t advertise heavily. On the lower end of the market, a lot of what you’re experiencing is just an industry that hasn’t evolved and doesn’t feel pressure to improve because sellers, not buyers, are their real clients.",

          "body": "In my experience, most modern hosting platforms should have stable uptime. I don't currently work with the kinds of sites that need backups so I can't contribute there. Infrastructure people (the sort that would discuss hosting) love scalability problems because that's what big tech pays big money for. That is why they talk about those things, but yeah that topic is usually not going to be super relevant to a small business. Short answer is that most modern hosting platforms that people speak positively about will do.  \n  \nOne thing to consider is that the point of higher end websites is to buy ads and send traffic to the site, then capture as many leads as possible. Performance and scalability can matter in those situations (probably performance more-so). A good designer wants to maximize the effectiveness of how the site sells visitors on your business so you get the most bang for you buck when advertising. \n\nThat being said, many small business owners don't see a website as a lead generation tool, even though I think they should (biased website maker talking). Many of them are just tired of saying \"no\" when people ask if they have a website.\n\nHopefully this was helpful somewhat, I don't have a lot to say about hosting because truly... most modern platforms handle all the hard stuff for you at reasonable monthly price, it's kind of plug and play.",

I've been hosting my websites with Nixihost for the past 2 years without any issues. The support is great, always eager to help when I reach out, they include lots of features such as SSL, security and backups in their packages and I pay about 60$ per year for 1 website hosting. Totally recommend checking them out!",
