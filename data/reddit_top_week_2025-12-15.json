I’m nowhere near being able to quit my job, but it’s enough for me to work here and there as I have spare time and build up a catalog of content to sell. It’s ebooks, for adults. With nsfw content. 😂 go figure people want that kind of stuff. Anyways, I sell it on some different storefronts and build up a readership following me. I’d say half is AI, but the other half is good creativity, else you just get lost in the storm of bad AI content. Anyhow, if anyone wants to know more, it’s pretty specialized stuff and most people don’t make much. But it’s possible. And from what I can tell, there are a lot of people out there making a lot of money in the same sort of niche. I also sell custom stories too, which I can partially make with AI. And though that’s more work, I have made almost $2k this year from 5 of those sales!",

Just moved it online and will be doing farmer's markets in summer to expand and extend the season. Started with about $1,000 10 years ago. Hoping to double my income, but we'll see.\n\nMy previous one was selling jewelry and accessories on eBay. I did that for about 5 years, and it helped me through some very tough financial times. I had a fun store where most people bought several items and often came back. That netted $2K-$5K/month depending on the season.\n\nAnother one that was super successful for a year ($100K that year) about 15 years ago was self-publishing books. I got lucky with a few that went viral. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to keep writing for myself, but I'm working on it now. I have several books going through the pipeline, and my launches will start in January. I have three niches I'm working in, but one is starting to stand out as having more potential.",

Figured I'd share what I found since most of the content out there is people regurgitating stuff they've never actually tried. The \"start an AI content agency\" advice needs to die. The market is completely flooded. Everyone jumped on this in early 2024 and now you're competing with thousands of people offering the same thing. Same deal with AI-generated art on print-on-demand sites. I tried this for two months and made literally $12. The designs all look the same and the market is buried in AI slop. What's actually worked for me is way less sexy. I started helping local businesses with basic AI stuff — not pitching them on \"AI solutions\" but just helping a dentist's office write better emails or showing a realtor how to speed up their listing descriptions. These people are like two years behind on this stuff and they're happy to pay someone to just figure it out for them. I also make decent money from Notion templates for a specific niche, but that took months to get traction. The uncomfortable part nobody talks about is the timeline. Nothing made real money in month one. It took me until month three or four before I was consistently hitting $300-500. Anyone promising faster results is trying to sell you a course. Curious what's actually working for other people who've moved past the \"I watched a YouTube video\" stage.",

          "body": "Your post nails the real problem: most “AI side hustles” are just recycled tactics with zero depth. What’s actually working today is unsexy, hyper-specific help for people who are behind on AI.\n\nWhat’s been working for me is using AI as a thinking partner with local professionals. Not selling them “AI solutions,” just helping them make better decisions faster. Example: breaking down a dentist’s patient communication flow, rewriting the scripts with AI, and helping staff use it daily. Small wins, but they pay because it saves them real time.\n\nThe pattern I’m seeing:\n\n1. Pick one profession that’s 2–3 years behind the curves.\n2. Sit with them, watch their workflow.\n3. Use AI to remove 20–30 minutes of pain from a task they repeat all week.\n4. Charge monthly for ongoing support, not one-off projects.\n\nIt’s not flashy. It’s slow for the first couple months. But once one person in that niche gets value, they refer you to others.\n\nCurious what niches others are seeing traction in. The “real work” side of AI is where the money seems to be, not in the trendy stuff.",

I did this solely so I could work on my own project cars.  Posting my stuff on social media would inadvertently generate leads and people DMing me for work done on their cars.  I then started doing side work.  Back in March 2025 I decided to scale it up and form an LLC and now it’s generating some real good income.  I’m pulling in new clients and closing out dealership level repair orders.  Last month was my best yet with a net profit of $12k.

I’m thinking it’s one of those $5 jobs where they want you to redesign planet earth. but whatever, I take it. turns out this man just wanted a button moved 12 pixels to the left. twelve.

I just stayed online out of pure stubbornness and mild insomnia.\n\nmoral of the story? idk man… sometimes life absolutely bodies you and then tosses you a reward like “here, champ, you survived the tutorial level.” just keep showing up. even if you’re a confused gremlin eating midnight noodles. apparently that’s enough 💀✨",

I'm worried about getting scammed or dealing with returns when someone says it stopped working.   \n  \nThen I look at furniture, decor, vintage kitchen stuff etc. Seems like way less competition and people will pay surprisingly good money for the right pieces.

My garage is already pretty full lol  \n  \nDoes anyone have experience with both? Like if you had to pick one lane which would actually be more profitable long term? I've got maybe $300-400 to invest upfront if that matters.

Put a post on your local Nextdoor neighborhood group (or Facebook or whatever neighborhood group is popular in your area) and say you will rake leaves, shovel snow, clean gutters, remove trash/bulk items from basements or attics and take them to the curb on garbage day. These are things that kids used to do for their neighbors in years past but they no longer do. I am 66 years old and would gladly hire you to do some of the  chores that I no longer feel like doing myself. I would pay decent money for you to clean and organize my garage or basement, rake my leaves, take out bulk trash on bulk trash pickup day. You get the idea.",

If you truly have 18 hours a day, that’s a weapon, but only if you pick ONE thing and go deep.\n\nSome realistic paths that don’t need money to start:  \n– Learn a simple service skill (editing, design, automation, outreach) and sell it to people already making money  \n– Learn how to build and sell small digital products (templates, checklists, scripts) around a specific problem  \n– Learn basic AI + workflow tools and help non-technical people use them  \n– Learn content + distribution (how posts actually get attention on Reddit, Twitter, etc.)\n\nThe key isn’t the niche. It’s committing to something for 30–60 days without switching every week. Boredom usually comes from lack of progress, not lack of options. Once you see even a small result, motivation follows fast.",

Internet, computer, tons of time, but no idea where to actually start or what to commit to.\n\nWhat helped me was not looking for “the best hustle” but first picking something I was genuinely curious about and could do with a computer. For me that was programming. I didn’t know where to start, so I zoomed out and looked at the bigger picture: web development. Then I saw frontend, backend, full stack, read a bit about each, and chose full stack simply because it sounded more interesting to me.\n\nOnce I picked that, I looked up which technologies are actually in demand right now and which ones caught my attention. After that, I used ChatGPT very intentionally. I asked it what languages and tools I should learn for those technologies and then asked it to create an 80/20 list of the specific topics I should study for them, focused only on what’s actually useful.\n\nFor each topic, I’d ask for a clear explanation, a practical example, and a small task to complete. I saved code and useful notes in an organized way so I could come back to them later. That structure alone helped a lot with consistency.\n\nAt the same time, since I want to make money online sooner rather than later, I also started learning smaller, low-barrier skills like creating SRT captions and similar tasks. Same approach: pick one thing I’m actually interested in, build a focused topic list, and work through it step by step instead of jumping around.",

      "selftext": "Hello 20 year old male from Australia. I work full time as a scaffolder 5 days a week. Am about to start security at nights on the weekends, but I want to make more money. I’m looking at putting some of my money into investments aswell, talking to people who invest and trying to learn (am a begginner). But I want to fill up that time especially in the weekdays after work, ways online or in any way to make some more money (preferably not something like labour as my body is tired after work, work 10 hour days). Willing to invest my money into something/things for this, just don’t know what yet. Am trying to find work for the morning of the weekend aswell (scaffolders I’m in connection with don’t work on weekends usually).\n\nAny tips to make money during the week on the way home from work and at night once I get home? And I don’t want to do surveys or anything like that, not worth my time. Something that I can make decent money, even if I have to invest money i don’t mind. Scared money don’t make no money haha. Aswell any tips on small passive incomes aswell, where I don’t have to spend too much time during the week and make a little bit of money. Things that pay out like surveys but don’t take as much time. \n\nOkay i’ll stop yapping thanks",

Give us specifics on the steps you took for each of these:\n\n* selling your art\n* Amazon KDP low-content books\n* POD\n* selling stuff online\n\nI've found from personal experience that all the things I \"failed at\" were things I didn't actually follow through on. \n\nLike - when I first started a blog (back in 2008, when you literally could get monetized after a couple of weeks just writing about a game on your iphone), I got approved for AdSense, then got bored and abandoned it instead of finding a niche I actually loved and sticking with it. So ... no millions from AdSense.\n\nGot approved for Amazon Affiliate - wrote a few blog posts and gave up because it wasn't converting \"fast enough\" for my liking. Guess what? If I'd done even ONE BF promo or a \"gift ideas for Christmas\" kind of post and *promoted it*, I'd have made enough to make me stick with it. So ... no millions from Amazon Affiliate.\n\nGot approved for Amazon Merch .... same story.\n\nDo you see the pattern here? It's not enough to START. You need to stick with something long enough to give it time to work, rather than giving up after a short while. \n\nPick a thing. Anything. Figure out how to get it online. \n\n***Do some actual promotion.*** &lt;- Without this, no online venture can succeed these days, there's just TOO much noise out there. So you'll need to put money into ads (the quickest way to get people to see what you're selling, and to buy, but you risk spending a lot of money if you don't know what you're doing and don't keep an eagle eye on that ad spend). Or you'll need to spend money figuring out how else to get discovered - either by posting regularly or by partnering with someone who does know what they're doing and can get you sales.\n\nYouTube can help you figure out where you're stumbling in a particular venture. Can help you get past the obstacles. More than any course you can buy, you'll learn by actually DOING the thing and figuring out how to get past the roadblocks. And there are roadblocks in everything we try that is new to us.\n\nGood luck. If you stick with something long enough, I can promise you you'll learn enough to make it work.",

          "body": "I'm not sure what you meant by selling your art, but if it was on Etsy, that's a LONG game. And even then, you're not guaranteed to be seen with all the other million of sellers. The people that do best on Etsy are the ones with a good social media following. \n\nI've been selling on Etsy since 2014 and it's not a big money maker for me. Partly because I can't scale my handmade items even if they did catch on. But I make enough to keep me going, giving me a small profit for a small bit of work.\n\nI don't have a social media presence, but I do okay. It took from 2014 - 2017 of learning Etsy SEO (which is not at all like Google SEO or eBay SEO), finding what works in my niche, oh and the biggie is to **have a niche**. Can you say exactly what your art is and identify a particular person and not generally 'people who have bulletin boards'? \n\nFor instance, I sell push pins, but my niche is Kawaii Cute style, and I only sell push pins.\n\nIf I need money, then selling things around the house on eBay is usually my best option, too. I was lucky my daughter was into collectibles figures, and even though (or because?) she played with them, they sold well. Sometimes I go to charity shops and find Barbie or My Little Pony things and those sell well. Even when selling on eBay, get a niche. Niches sell better than just throwing things up. When I sell on eBay it's usually toys. And because of that I now have an eye for what toys sell.\n\nIf I went around and just bought random things, I'd have more misses (things that don't sell) than hits with fast selling items.\n\nPeople are not making millions with PDFs unless the PDF is in a specific niche that people need.\n\nOn Etsy, there is a person that does make a lot of money with Excel spreadsheets. But she is very good with Excel and is able to do good customer service since she understands Excel and how people will mess up the formulas.  She can also customize the Excel spreadsheets for what Etsy sellers need. \n\nIf you have a strength that someone needs for their business, then that's the way to go. Her shop is successful (in my opinion) due to word of mouth. When I see on Etsy seller forums someone asking for accounting help, they will mention this shop and say they liked her forms. These cost about $100 each, but people buy them because she is good at what she does.\n\nPOD is always tough, even if you have your own artwork. There are so much POD shirts (etc) that it's hard to get seen. At one time (Etsy has been cracking down a little bit on this) people would buy a design on CreativeFabrica and without changing a thing stick it on a POD shirt. At one time if you looked up Be Kind t-shirt you'd see over 1,000 listings of the exact same \"Be Kind\" with Boho rainbow in the same colors, all the listings one after another. This made Etsy search a bit boring, so Etsy did crack down and reminded people that the seller has to change the design significantly enough for it to be unique. \n\nEven so, POD is not the road to riches. One youtuber showed how much he made with POD shirts. With advertising (which he said he needed) he made $1.00 for each shirt. Without Advertising he made something like $3 or so on POD shirts. When he started printing his own shirts in his garage he ended up with about $10 profit from each shirt, but as you can imagine that is a lot of work. \n\nNow he is an Etsy Coach. I don't even think that is the way to riches, but it pays better than POD. It takes a lot to get seen in that area as well. \n\nMy thoughts: you have to be fantastic at marketing (or at least find your audience somewhere like on TikTok or Pinterest) and have an equally fantastic product. But then, sometimes foreign manufacturers (or even Michaels, the craft store) will see it, copy it and mass produce it for pennies on the dollar. I do better at my 9-5 (despite what Etsy coaches say) than I do in my Etsy shop.\n\nMy reliable \"side hustle\" is Fetch Rewards. It's not much, though. I probably average enough points every 3 months for a $50 gift card. The games have the most points, not the receipts. \n\nI consider my Etsy shop more like a part time job. It doesn't bring in much, there are no benefits, but I'm always on call to answer customer questions. Not what I call a side hustle. 😋\n\nGood luck!",

Obviously it fluctuates but on average I'd probably make $100-500 a week and spent maybe 10-60mins total per week (sourcing stuff, posting it and meeting people)\n\n\n\n\nMy process:\n\n\n\nUse [warehousewatcher.com](http://warehousewatcher.com) to find Amazon warehouse deals, alot of that stuff is 40% off + and is in like new condition. If you can't find a buyer you can always return it too.\n\n\nAlso if you go directly on [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) enter \"warehouse deals\" in the search field, this also lets you look through their warehouse items, however they've made it increasingly hard to see what's actually in stock without clicking on the item first.\nAnother excellent way to source product is if you're lucky enough to have online auctions with local pickup near you. You'd be surprised how cheap you can get things simply because you don't have competition.\n\n\n\n Places like maxsold.com list estate sales, auctions etc nearby Also places like canoe.com, keepa.com and camelcamelcamel.com are useful for finding lightning deals to flip as well. Just check camelcamelcamel to see how much it's worth regularly.\n\n\n\n\nRules, always meet in public, preferably somewhere you can get to within 2 mins or less. And never leave until they say they've arrived. This way you don't actually waste any time if people decide to ghost you (which will happen)\n\n\n\n\nIt just occured to me to post this after several friends and family just told me they were tossing out perfectly new stuff because it was \"taking up space\". I told them to list it on marketplace and it literally just never occurred to them that they could do that. Just in case others are in the same habit, thought I'd bring it up.",

          "body": "Based on what you already do for work, SMMA makes the most sense to start with since you're literally already doing it. You know the work, you just need to find clients and charge properly for it.\n\nVideo editing for shorts is in high demand right now. Every business wants short form content and most can't edit themselves. Easier to get clients than long form youtube stuff too since the turnaround is faster.\n\nUGC could work but it's getting really saturated and brands are picky. Unless you have a specific niche or look they're after, it might be harder to break into than the other options.\n\nAppointment setting has hype because it's basically sales without the closing part. If you're good at talking to people and following up it pays well but it's also commission based usually so income can be unstable starting out.\n\nMost lucrative long term is probably SMMA if you can scale it. Easiest to get first clients is video editing since you can show a portfolio fast and there's tons of demand.\n\nNone of these are easy full time gigs immediately tho. You'll probably need to do your 9-5 for a while and build the side thing for 6+ months before it can replace your income. The people making full time money from these put in serious hours for months before it paid off.",

I did this for a stint between jobs and it was surprisingly effective. \n\n\n Obviously it fluctuates but on average I'd probably make $100-500 a week and spent maybe 10-60mins total per week (sourcing stuff, posting it and meeting people)\n\n\n\n\nMy process:\n\n\n\n\nUse warehousewatcher.com to find Amazon warehouse deals, alot of that stuff is 40% off + and is in like new condition. If you can't find a buyer you can always return it too.\n\n\n\n\nAlso if you go directly on amazon.com enter \"warehouse deals\" in the search field, this also lets you look through their warehouse items, however they've made it increasingly hard to see what's actually in stock without clicking on the item first. Another excellent way to source product is if you're lucky enough to have online auctions with local pickup near you. You'd be surprised how cheap you can get things simply because you don't have competition.\n\n\n\n\nPlaces like maxsold.com list estate sales, auctions etc nearby Also places like canoe.com, keepa.com and camelcamelcamel.com are useful for finding lightning deals to flip as well. Just check camelcamelcamel to see how much it's worth regularly.\n\n\n\n\nRules, always meet in public, preferably somewhere you can get to within 2 mins or less. And never leave until they say they've arrived. This way you don't actually waste any time if people decide to ghost you (which will happen)",

Its been a roller coaster but we cant get out of this jam. My wife works as a shopper and delivers to customers home. She makes anywhere between 800-1200 a week. Pay for this company has really decreased overtime and she works 5-6 days a week.\n\nI work for a friend who gets the ins on tax refund opportunities for small and big businesses. Section 125 cafeteria plans (not easy to sell and whoever i did sign up only brings me about $500/3 months).\n\nTip tax credit that will only pay in 6-10 weeks (its an irs refund and just takes a little bit for turn around. I have about 29 apps in with 1/4 that don't qualify. Either way, its gonna be a while).\n\nI just got my life/health/accident license in NYC and paid another grand for insurance + extra states line of authority (in the last month, passed my test 10/20). My friend got us an in with a company that does medicare but AOE(annual open enrollment is closed til jan 1st) so cant use this license yet unless i start working for some company.\n\nI signed up with a local company that does roadside for insurance companies which i try to do when im not doing tip tax phone calls and that brings in about 100-150 a day after tips if i work a few hours.\n\nI have stuff i bought for cheap to resell thats not moving nearly fast enough, barely 100/month (i also stopped buying cuz no funds).\n\nI bought a car about a year ago that I'm renting out and is bringing me $250 a month renting it out.\n\nI power wash a fleet of 13 smaller busses for $70 each once a month that I split with a partner but now in the winter it will slow down.\n\nIm not lazy, and i dont mind finding a job, but i spent so much money on my license, and have the other stuff going, that im not sure if I should do that.\n\nExpenses.... we pay $2500/month for the house (we bought together with my father in law but he put 80% down so we are paying towards the house (he also annual property taxes of about 7k+), and we have lived here for 4 years.) \n\nBetween $150-350/month on electric (we do have solar panels transferred from the previous owners that cost my FIL $80/month) \n\nBetween $120-200/month on gas/heating \n\n$40 for wifi (verizon fios 300mb) \n\n$120 for tmobile (2 lines) \n\n$1900/month for 2 kids school (non negotiable and cannot take them out) 3rd kid is free through state pre k 4. \n\nAbout $200/month paying back previous school fees, catching up \n\nAbout $100/month for memberships \n\nAbout $300/month for kids extracurricular activities \n\nWe do receive assistance for food but spend about $500-800/month for food Maybe $120 fuel/month \n\nCar insurance is 340/month through geico for 3 cars.(2019 hybrid minivan, my 09 pickup and the car im renting out.)\n\nanywhere between 6000 - 7500 monthly expenses including CC payments.\n\nWe have CC balances mounting to about 25k out of 120k available. Paying what we can I have a bachelor's in business administration and computer science from a great online school during covid.\n\n30k in student loans that I'm having defeated over and over and haven't made a payment yet.\n\nI started a roadside assistance website (clearpathprollc.com) that gets a ton of traffic but no orders yet. I just started another site through shop if to attempt dropshipping but haven't completed it yet.\n\nPlease dont troll, please dont scam. I'll take constructive criticism, tips, opportunities. Im a hustler, im known to take on way too much but I know how to juggle it. I am patient, have plenty of customer service experience, great with leadership and logistics, planning, and am very tech savvy. I did own a moving company for 7 years and closed when covid happened. I was considering starting again but not its not busy enough from what i hear..\n\nThank you, willing to answer most questions",

          "body": "I’m not sure exactly what type of job would be best based on your license. but even though you spent so much on it I would not let it restrict your opportunities. Many people change careers, jobs and pivot to different industries entirely in their lifetime. Keep an open mind and consider the right sidehustle could make back anything you put into that license and even more.\n\nThe other advice I’d give is try to focus on ONE thing. I know you are trying different things and that is good to a degree. But juggling too many things can actually make it harder to focus on one thing that could really make the difference.\n\nI can’t tell you whats best for your situation, but whats working for me is trying Affiliate Marketing for high ticket items. I can work from home, theres no shortage of products or people buying things (just ask Amazon) and pay is not capped by hourly wages or salary like traditional jobs.\nI’m happy to discuss more if you want shoot me a message.\nBest of Luck.",

      "selftext": "I'm not someone who brags. But dammit I deserve it right now haha.\n\nI worked a super dead end job while I was still living with my parents a few years ago (20 years old at the time). I didn't have a lot going for me at all but I knew I wanted something bigger. So I started to save up just to do it. It took me a year of saving as much as I possibly could and I turned around and risked it all by opening up a vending machine franchise. I was determined to make it work because of my literal life savings gone in a blink of an eye.\n\nI went with a company that was turnkey and also claimed to help with getting me into locations (smartmarket solutions) but I was only able to purchase two machines at the time because of costs and how much my savings was. Again, risked it for the biscuit lol.\n\nI was able to instantly start making passive income. And then I was very quickly able to surpass how much I was making as a manager in retail. I decided to save it because I was still in the same position I was beforehand and also still lived with my parents. I felt like this was too good to be true and it freaked me out LOL.\n\nAfter a few months of steadily outpacing my income, I decided to turn around those profits and buy 2 more machines. So now up to 4. Last week I was able to quit that job and in the timeframe of November 8th to today, I passed $10k.\n\nComing from someone who was living at home (moved out last weekend!!), working a terrible job making $25k a year, while watching all my friends go off to launch their careers, and really just accepting my fate...I'm here to tell you three magical words: Take the chance.\n\nThis subreddit is a HUGEEEEEEE part of my success and planted a ton of seeds. I can't remember where I heard about franchising out vending machines first (def here or yt) but I know I read like a manic before making the decision. There's so many people here who are in a similar place and just don't take the chance. Take the chance. It could change the course of your life.\n\nSo. There's my brag. It took a lot for me to write this since I'm someone who very much doesn't like to talk about my success or whatever. But this feels different for whatever reason. SO thanks for reading and I hope you take that chance :D\n\n(by the way you better believe I'm reinvesting a large majority. rinse and repeat BABYYYY!!!!)\n\nEdit: I’m a bit overwhelmed. For those that are looking for a message of hope, please view this as that. I don’t care what company you go with or what side hustle you pick. Rooting for you! And thank you for the kindness for those that have given it. Definitely going to be stepping away from screens for a bit after this one. ",

I did a bit of sniffing around and found out that this company was known as HealthyYOU Vending a couple months ago until they changed to Smartmarts.ai\n\nLooking at their BBB profile they had about 3 terrible complains(one star)in 2022 then had some 5-7 5stars that honestly sounded fake. Too optimistic and some didn't give enough details. Then another one star review as the most recent. 3.6 stars overall.\n\nLooking at Reddit posts, Facebook posts and overall just web surfing I've found that they promised you everything but when they finally got you the machines you'd find out that they WOULDN'T help you with finding the location after promising you that they would do so. Also YOU ARE THE ONE REFILLING THE MACHINES. There isn't some guy from the company doing this YOU ARE. Also they would sell you the machine 2x what it was actually valued at and made you pay service fees that when you actually needed servicing done they would Ghost you or keep you calling others in the company.  And the training? I found some post saying that you wouldn't get any training or if they did provide you then you wouldn't be able to contact the instructor a couple months afterwards.\n\nThe same guy Jeff Marsh, is the president and Co-Founder of the companies. I found a Instagram post from ifpginc titled \"Jeffrey Marsh, Founder of Smart Market Solutions (formerly Healthy YOU Vending) join Red for this IFPG Discover. Lot's of innovation, pivoting, and industry evolution happening through them!\" That mentioned this transition in the first few minutes of the 14 min interview. Didn't see it all bc i just wanted to do a small look into this company. Don't have much interest in it but this rabbit hole looked very complex.\n\nThe staff is the same as the old company other than Location Procurement Team Lead being changed. And a new co founder mike Burnett being mentioned.\n\nHonestly i see so many red flags here. If y'all still want to do something like this then all's to you succeeding. GL.",

Obviously a good chunk of people here agree, I'd wager most don't. And that's because we know how life works.\n\nPassive, if we're being strict with the term, only applies to wealthy people. We all know that. The reason why the word remained is because back in the 2010s when \"making money\" was becoming a popular topic on Youtube, \"passive income\" as a term was used to describe income AFTER either an initial investment in time, money or labor. So the idea was, DO THIS HARD WORK for X amount of time, THEN enjoy the benefits of that work LONG after its made.\n\nBut new people, like OP, started coming into this space, or learned of this term without knowing the history of the term, and began critiquing others using the word properly.",

There is no such thing as a passive job. Passive income represents money you earn while you sleep. By your logic, not even investing is true passive income because:\n1) the money still needed to be earned one way or another.\n2) someone is still out there actively managing that investment (whether it is you or a broker)\n\nSo, if someone invests upfront time and costs into a vending machine business that needs to be emptied and stocked (say once a month), the entire month that it’s not being actively stocked or emptied it is earning you passive income. I would argue that vending machines are a source of TRUE passive income since they can’t be use while being filled…\n\nThe same maintenance schedule can be applied to buying and selling stocks. Once you invest that first initial time, or any subsequent time if you buy and/or sell, it becomes active, but while it sits there, it is passive.\n\nOnce you make and upload a YouTube video, it can now bring in passive income (in theory; popularity and many other factors play a big role). Once production is done, the video needs little/no maintenance to continue to get views and have earning potential. Sure, you have to put in work to make the videos and set up ads or whatever you need to do, but each video you make and upload creates its own stream of passive income.",

If I have to make sales calls to convince businesses owners to let me make them a website and then I have to go online to the AI tools to make said website and then present it to the client and keep track of my funds in a spreadsheet I make from scratch.

      "selftext": "Hey everyone not sure if you remember me but back in June I started an update series on this sub called Selling Weekly \"Lottos\". My goal was to try and show people how selling options using your shares and cash as collateral can be an amazing form of passive income.\n\n\n\n\n\nNever stopped, just moved my posts over to places with a similar community related to selling options for income. Still showing all my choices and results every week.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack when I just started it here I got a few people saying to show the longer term results.\n\n\n\n\n\nWell 6 months was last week. I made almost $40,000 using an average weekly risk of $132,000. Thats a 30% total yield.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this was a normal 40 hour a week job I would have been making $38 per hour for this last 6 months doing this. But I barely spend an hour a week opening and closing the positions.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople really misunderstand this strategy. They think you can lose everything, but out of 26 weeks I only lost 2 weeks and both were normal investing losses, nothing outlandish.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople also think it will underperform the market. Well my results show this outperforms the market. I got double the return of SPY in this time frame.\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly people think its risky, but its risk adjusted returns are the highest. Maybe people automatically assume because it has to do with options contracts so its like wsb.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll i'm doing is making an agreement with a buyer to either sell the shares much higher or buy the shares much lower by next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gambler pays a premium for this chance because they can make a lot of money in a short time if the stock really does go up or down huge.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you really look at the charts stocks mostly stay sideways for a long time then get a sudden burst where they go straight up or down for a short period of time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThats why this outperforms just buying and holding SPY in my opinion. You are getting income every week just because stocks COULD go up or down.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd its not like dividends where the money is subtracted out of your shares. Options premium income is in additional to any unrealized gains.\n\n\n\n\n\nI also get an automatic HYSA for cash being used for cash secured puts. This is a 3.65% icing on the cake called a Money Market Account in brokerages. That interest income isn't included in the results.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I'll keep seeing whats happens. We had perfect market conditions for this strategy this last 6 months, so I want to test this out in a less forgiving market.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, let me know if you have questions and I'll try to ELi5.",

      "selftext": "I know this may not be something talked about often here but hear me out, I think I might be onto something. So casinos have been doing rakeback forever basically giving players a slice of the house edge back so they keep grinding. Sportsbooks almost never touch that because the margins are way thinner, but I’m trying to see if there’s actually a way to make something similar work on the sports side.  \n  \nSo I’ve been looking into this sweeps sportsbook called Bracco and I noticed something that made me pause. Not saying it’s good or bad I’m genuinely trying to figure out whether this is beatable or if I’m just missing something obvious. They seem to actually publish the house edge for each bet type, and then they give you 50% of that edge back instantly in free bets??  \n  \nExample:  \nA 3 leg parlay is listed as having an 8% house edge.  \nSo if you bet $100, they expect to make $8 then they give you $4 back right away.  \n  \nThat’s where I started running numbers to see if there’s an angle.  \nI’m around 52% long-term on -110 lines (DFS background, years of tracking). On straight bets, that’s still a small negative roughly -$0.72 per $100.  \n  \nBut applying that 52% hit rate to a 3-leg -110 parlay:  \nPayout is +596  \nProbability of hitting all 3 at 52% per leg: 14.05%  \nEV of the parlay itself: -2.13%  \nAdd back their 4% rakeback (half of the 8%): overall EV becomes +1.87%  \n  \nWhich… feels wrong? Like mathematically it says you’re profitable on $100 bets when you shouldn’t be. My gut says they’re banking on people getting greedy and firing 6-, 8-, 10-leggers until the edge swings back their way. But if someone stays disciplined and repeats the same 3-leg structure, I’m honestly not pointing to the flaw yet.  \n  \nSo yeah am I thinking about this correctly? Is there a hidden catch or is this one of those rare situations where the house is overestimating its own edge and we can actually squeeze something out of it? Would love someone smarter to poke holes in this because it feels too good.",

Have you looked into investing in dividend stocks? That’s as passive as things get. I would also recommend looking into selling options (“covered calls” and “cash secured puts”) - they’re super easy and can make you a lot of money fairly passively, but they can require a lot of capital depending on which stocks you want to sell options against.\n\nObviously there’s also buying rental properties, which, again, can require quite a bit of capital to get going unless you do creative financing. \n\nThere’s micro-lending through platforms like Prosper.\n\nThere’s interest that you can collect from high yield savings accounts and US Treasuries. \n\nCrypto staking is another avenue, depending on which state you live in and how comfortably you are with cryptocurrency. \n\nThen on the product side you can make and sell digital products like E-books (or even physical books though Amazon and Barnes and Noble). You can also sell digital products through sites like Shopify or Etsy. You could also create and sell courses…\n\nThere are a lot of different routes you can take, just friends on your skills, knowledge, whether you want to make a product or just buy assets.\n\nI personally collect passive income through stock dividends, selling stock options, staking crypto, collecting interest from high yield savings accounts and T bills and micro-loans, and revenue from YouTube videos, sales of digital products on Shopify and Etsy, and I collect royalties from music streams (Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, etc.) and music publishing (SoundExchange and BMI).\n\nIt can be done, it just depends on what direction(s) you want to take.",

Buy a small content site with existing traffic\n\nBut don’t buy random Flippa junk. Look for:\n\n6–12 months of Google Search Console data\n\n50%+ traffic from informational keywords\n\nMonetized via affiliates or lead gen (not ads alone)\n\n\nAfter buying:\n\nUpdate top 10 posts\n\nAdd better CTAs\n\nRepurpose content to Pinterest + Reddit + Quora This alone can 2–3× revenue without new content.\n\n\n2. Build a “semi-passive” site + paid traffic for validation\n\nInstead of waiting for SEO:\n\nPick one boring but profitable niche (finance tools, SaaS, health accessories, B2B services)\n\nBuild 20 high-intent pages\n\nSpend $500–$1k testing Google or Pinterest traffic\nOnce you find pages that convert → scale or hand off.\n\n\n3. Digital asset &gt; product\n\nBuying a site that sells a single digital product (template, calculator, checklist) is often cleaner than blogs.\n\nNo inventory\n\nHigher margins\n\nEasier to automate with email + retargeting\n\n\n4. What I’d avoid\n\n“Automated” Amazon sites\n\nAI-generated content farms\n\nSites without email lists or search data\n\n\nPassive income today = upfront work + owned traffic → maintenance later.\nAnything truly hands-off is usually either oversold or underperforming",

Good luck.  This is much easier than buying a house and renting it out.\n\nJust google defined risk options spreads you can lean to trade one ticket that you know something about TSLA is good but you can use Walmart or any company the concept is the same.  If the spread is 19 points you want to pay no more than .35 percent that is a guide.  The part you want is for it to be in an uptrend.  Keep in mind right.

Just their desk. So I'm definitely not showing my face anywhere.\n\nBeen trying to make productivity content work since August. Time management tips, how to organize your day, that kind of stuff. Figured it couldn't be that hard.\n\nIt was that hard.\n\nStarted with text over stock footage. Coffee cups and notebooks. Nobody watched. Maybe 400 views per video and it took forever to edit each one.\n\nTried filming my hands writing in a planner after a few weeks. One video got 1900 views and I thought I figured it out. Made a bunch more. They got like 500 each. So I didn't figure it out.\n\nKept posting through September and October. Views stayed around 500 to 700. Wasn't great but at least it was consistent.\n\nThen I bought better equipment because everyone said quality matters. Microphone for $95. Got a music subscription and some caption app. Was paying like $40 a month for tools. My videos looked way more professional.\n\nViews got worse. Dropped back down to 400, sometimes 300. I literally spent money to go backwards.\n\nMy roommate kept asking how it was going in this voice like she thought the whole thing was pointless. It probably was. I'd been doing it for months and made zero dollars.\n\nFew weeks ago I just changed everything. Made the videos look like an actual person talking instead of text floating around. Using CapCut for editing, APOB for the face part since I obviously can't use mine, and Riverside for audio. About $30 a month total so at least it's cheaper than before.\n\nViews got better. Not consistent but better. Some videos get 5000 views, some get 1800. I still have no idea why. Posted two videos about morning routines last week. Same style, same length. One got 5800 views and one got 1600. Makes zero sense.\n\nI'm at 1900 followers now. A productivity app reached out last week and paid me $100 for a sponsored video. First money I've made from this.\n\nTold my roommate and she was like oh wow you actually made money. Yeah. $100. After four months. That covers my share of groceries for two weeks.\n\nI still don't know what I'm doing. Some videos work and most don't. The algorithm feels completely random. I'm putting in maybe 5 hours a week and I can't tell if it's going anywhere.\n\nThe $100 is something but it's also basically nothing. I could've done Uber Eats on weekends and made way more without spending hours trying to figure out why one video gets 5800 views and another gets 1600.\n\nBut what if I quit now and next month I actually start making decent money. Or what if I keep going and it stays like this and I just wasted more time.\n\nI'm tired of not knowing if this is worth it or if I should just cut my losses and do something that actually pays consistently.\n\nHow long did it take you to figure out if content was actually worth sticking with?",

Everyone owns 5-20 properties but nobody has any clue which ones perform well, they're all just guessing on rent prices and maintenance budgets, flying blind on which property to sell first if they need cash.\n\nConvinced 3 friends to give me read only access to their property data for a free trial. Sent them weekly reports showing underperforming units, rent optimization opportunities, maintenance spending alerts, market comparisons against similar properties in their area. All 3 offered to pay immediately after first report, didn't even finish the trial period.\n\nBuilt it into a service at $99/month. “How is this a passive income?” I use leni to automate the analysis work and get all the necessary insights fast. No manual hours per cliet, which would've also made this impossible to scale. Now at 47 subscribers which is $4,653/month. Time investment is maybe 4-5 hours weekly reviewing what gets flagged and personalizing the reports with my insights.\n\nGrowth has been 100% word of mouth through investor groups and rei [meetups.Business](http://meetups.Business) model works because investors know they're leaving money on table but don't have time or skills to analyze properly. I'm not doing anything sophisticated, just filling gap between \"I know I should track this\" and tracking it. Like one client found few thosands in missed rent increases just from first analysis, another discovered they should've sold a property 2 years ago based on performance trends.",

You could buy some of the cheaper books and up charge them when reselling. Like I saw a book online for $20, that cost $200 at like Walmart. As long as they are more affordable than the brand new copies, and you build a reputable reputation, people might pay more than the cheapest option if they know that they can trust the seller.\n\nYou could work with college students, because colleges tend to upcharge a crazier amount than regular stores. (Literally got my college to lower their textbook price by $200 just because a local store had it $200 cheaper.) (Make sure to take plenty of pictures of the textbooks, so the consumers know what they are getting.)",

Even for 1m+ followers, for a meme page you could expect to earn $15 - $50 per sponsored post until you can prove audience viability.\n\nMy advice would be to find / wait for some general sponsors, find out what does well w your audience, and then shift to promoting affiliate products that you’ll get a % commission on. That’s when you’ll actually start earning, once you find a product you know your audience will like + a business willing to play ball &amp; give you a cut of their actual earnings.",

          "body": "For practical stuff that actually pays, what's worked for me as a student is: \n\nFreelancing basic skills on Fiverr or Upwork if you're decent at anything like writing, Excel, or even data entry. First month I made like $50 while building reviews but now it's steadier. Takes time though, maybe 2-3 months before it feels worth it. Also Upwork now makes you buy connects to apply to jobs but if your profile is good u might get invited for the jobs so if your buildin a profile there make sure to keep it polished.\n\nRemote part time work like customer service or virtual assistant jobs. \n\nFor smaller amounts faster, survey and reward apps work but they're slow. I make around $80-100 a month from a few apps combined using stuff like Swagbucks, Branded Surveys, and Babki which has both surveys and games. It's not impressive but it covers my Spotify and food between paychecks. Takes maybe 2 weeks to see your first cashout depending on the app.\n\nAs a finance student you could also look into tutoring high school kids through Wyzant or similar sites. Pays better than surveys and you can set your own rates.\n\nThe honest answer is nothing pays quick and easy. The stuff that pays well takes months to build up. The stuff that pays immediately doesn't pay much. Pick based on whether you need money this week or you're okay with a longer ramp up for better pay later.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche.\n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1.\t⁠start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n2.\t⁠once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n3.\t⁠once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course.\n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you.\n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

Go to “people also ask” section, collect those with free chrome plugins “ahrefs” or “people also ask” (1 min deep mode or 3 level deep is fine, you’ll get what I mean once u use it)\n3. Go to image tab, collect both entities in the chips horizontal menu uptop, also collect related entities from the images results (there are couple of lists of 5-6 entities popping up between images)\n\nLook at the phrases/keywords/entities you got, select those that describe characteristic or integral part of your main keyword, for example for “water” it will be “temperature” or “boiling temperature”, for “retirement calculator” it will be “formula”, “by age” “chart by age”. See if those aspects of your tool are mentioned on your page. Use only those that are super-closely tight to your main entity, like some characteristics that are integral to your entity, by integral I mean determinative qualities, like for example you can not call your page “dragon” and not mention giant flying lizard spitting fire.\n\nThen go to your competition websites up to place 20, see if there is conventional knowledge about the topic that they mention and you don’t. Warning: if competition is high authority government websites or wikipedia like websites, I would ignore those and look for blog like sites and tools sites like your own.\n\nAfter you enhanced one of the tools pages, you should write supporting articles for this tool. The process of finding a topic and content to write is similar to finding holes in you tool’s page, but this time you are looking for related topics and entities, not tight to “retirement calculator”, you are looking for things like “what’s 401k”, “how to plan retirement for couples”. I do usually pick wider general topics that have a chance to bring traffic on their own, but low traffic keywords will do too, the only reason we need them is to boost the main page with an internal link.\n\nIf you going to try this method, I can describe what to do in details, that’s a general idea.",

Marketing always felt important but never urgent.\n\nThe numbers make this worse:\n\n* Consistent posting drives **2–3× higher engagement**\n* Regular publishers generate **60% more inbound leads**\n* Yet **70%+ founders admit they post only “when they find time”**\n\nThat was me.\n\nThe real issue wasn’t motivation.  \nIt was **decision fatigue**.\n\nEvery post required too many decisions:  \nWhat should I say?  \nWhich platform?  \nDoes this sound salesy?  \nIs this even useful?\n\nSo I stopped trying to “be consistent” and built a **simple framework** instead.\n\n**The framework:**\n\n1. **One idea → many platforms** One core message becomes posts for X, LinkedIn, Instagram, and long-form.\n2. **Draft first, refine later** Speed beats perfection.\n3. **Remove daily decisions** If you decide what to post every day, consistency dies.\n4. **Sound human, not clever** Simple content outperforms polished copy.\n5. **Systems &gt; motivation** When posting takes minutes, showing up is easy.\n\nOnce this was in place, posting stopped feeling heavy. I wasn’t forcing discipline the system carried me.\n\nI’m sharing this because most founders don’t have a content problem.  \nThey have a **process problem**.\n\nWould love to hear how others here stay consistent without burning out.\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1pmk1r6)",

Content works.  \nMost SaaS benchmarks show content-led products drive **2–3x more inbound leads** over time. Yet founders avoid it because it’s mentally exhausting.\n\nThe real problem wasn’t writing.  \nIt was **deciding what to write every single day**.\n\nSo instead of forcing daily creativity, I built a simple framework that now gives me weeks of content in one sitting. Sharing it in case it helps someone else.\n\n**1: Pick one real customer pain**  \nNot topics. Not platforms.  \nJust one problem your user actually feels (ex- “I don’t know what to post”).\n\n**2: Expand the idea, not the workload**  \nOne idea can become:  \n– a short post  \n– a long post  \n– a thread  \n– a video hook  \n– a blog angle\n\nSame idea. Multiple outputs.\n\n**3: Change the lens**  \nTeach it, warn about it, share a mistake, give a checklist, or show a before/after.\n\n**4: Respect the platform**  \nSame idea, different shape.  \nEach platform rewards different formats, not different ideas.\n\n**5: Generate in batches**  \nWhen you stop deciding daily, content stops draining you.\n\nThis dropped my content time from hours to **15–20 minutes a day** and made consistency sustainable.\n\nSharing this here in case any other founders are stuck in the same loop.\n\nHappy to answer questions or break this down further if helpful.",

(Both sites were basically vibe coded by me with basic programming experience. Hiring them out would have been over $100k - irrelevant detail).\n\nWhat has been insane is the lifestyle freefall.\n\nI was always scared to become an entrepreneur because of this exact thing. Now I am living it.\nOne business is profitable but still early stage. The other is a startup that needs heavy lifting.\nBoth require marketing, ads, experiments, money going out before money comes in.\nI underestimated how competitive it is just to get attention. Meta ads, Google ads, creative testing, all of it. I really thought I could just show up and grow something. Absolutely delusional.\n\nThe hardest part?\nIgnoring the headhunters calling with mid six figure jobs.\nI know I can go back. I know I can make money tomorrow. But that is the life I spent years trying to escape.\n\nAnd then there is the identity shift.\nTelling girls I am building companies instead of being the finance guy at a big fund.\nNot casually dropping $200 on sushi like it is nothing.\nNot skiing every winter.\nNot having that easy, comfortable narrative of I am doing well.\n\nIt is humbling. Honestly, some days it is embarrassing. I did not expect it to hit this hard.\n\nBut I also have so much respect now for entrepreneurs who stuck through this phase and made it work. You do not realize how much grit it takes until you are the one staring at the ceiling at 3AM wondering if you are insane.\n\nRant over.\n\nWould love to hear if anyone else went through this identity and lifestyle whiplash when switching from a high paying job to entrepreneurship.",

You’ve also got to determine what the exit looks like, and when to say when. Various bench marks along the way and awareness to play improv when the unseen appears.\n\nAll the feelings- negative and positive- exist in every arena.

Have 0 regrets starting the business though. I'll continue it on the side and never have to live with the \"what if?\"\n\nNever gave a fuck about the prestige so if it means moving to some mid office role for half the income so my future kids don't despise me, so be it.\n\nGood luck with whatever you chose, brotha!",

All work sucks. At least you’re getting paid and can move up to another company if you thought ahead prior to quitting and also your young. Making that money at 30 is rare. \n\nSecond thought is fuck you again. People dream of making 33% of what you were making. Entrepreneurship is hard. Owning your own business is a slog.  Owning is not as easy as a collecting 300k a year, probably work from home, with 30 days PTO job. It’s actually difficult. You’re lucky to have the cushion to support yourself and your business. And be young enough where you don’t have kids to have to support too. \n\nYour biggest concern is telling girls you’re building companies instead of being in finance?. Give me a break. That’s the douchiest thing I’ve ever heard. \n\nBe humble. Build your product. Shut the fuck up and get your head in the right place. Ownership and being a founder is not easy. Learn from your mistakes and be thankful you can pay your bills while your company(s) grow and while mistakes are made. \n\nI’m 44. Built and shipped 9 apps, partner in a vintage retail store, and wrote a self help book for people with terminal illness. I worked for someone else for 3 years total in my life. Business ownership isn’t easy nor is it for everyone. Good for you for trying.  The reality of entrepreneurship, not everyone succeeds. Not everyone exits for 100M\n\nTake a year or two and work the business. If it fails, it fails. My advice, keep your day job, stay humble and work the business untill it can replace your salary. Or just be happy making 300K at 30 years old.",

Saved most of it to start my company, spent the rest making problems go away so I could spend time volunteering with a charity I loved.\n\nI didn't start that way, grew up poor and food scarce, but got lucky and had access to a computer lab at school. Learned what I needed for a career in the biz/tech side of games.\n\nThis year my wife and I scrimped and saved to get snowboarding equipment and a pass again. I've gone years now without an athletic outlet I enjoyed and it was getting to me.\n\nThe hardest part is finding the balance. With money, you can buy time to focus on finding joy. Without it, you're spending tons of energy and time trying to make things work. I wouldn't go back but I sorely miss how easy it was to make changes and solve problems.",

I enjoy working with my hands and physically feel tired rather than being a mind zombie at night.\n\nWhen I was working in finance, the research, the deals were fun but I was lacking satisfaction that you get when you actually accomplish something and see the results. Every so often I would sit in front  of the screens and think to myself what would be if I had my own company..\n\nOne day I was at the office and said fuck it, gave my two weeks, and left. After that went to school to get the licenses it took 9 months. Once the company started operating it was just go go go, spend money to earn money. I can’t say I was expecting it to be easy, but the construction business is kind of bad (for me) and I’m realizing it now.\n\nI am an honest person and pretty fair and ethical. I have my prices and pay subtrades  early and full amounts, don’t hassle with them, I want them to win. All that for its to only bite me in the ass after. Work is badly done, and I have to swallow the problem. \n\nI deal with businesses, and the delays are 30-45 days on paper, but in reality it’s 60-90-120 days. What really sucks is that I’m essentially financing projects out of pocket, to then wait and suck up for stuff that wasn’t part of the deal so I please the clients to not only get my money back, but to get paid.\n\nAnyway the image change and ego is what I think stops me from going all in. Going from fancy offices, travelling, spending thousands at restaurants to now always surviving. I essentially have one foot in this new career and the other still in finance, every so often I think of going back. To this day I haven’t updated my LinkedIn since leaving finance because there’s something I feel embarrassed about. \n\nThe entrepreneurial life is hard, depending of your resources and how you approach it. I had to bootstrap it, and doing much more work in different fields now. The testing part is hard, the client acquisition is hard, managing people especially hard headed construction guys is hard, bitchy and demanding clients. Everything about entrepreneurship is hard, I thought construction was in such demand, yeah maybe it is if you’re building new neighborhoods or government contracts, but you have to get to that point, and that’s the hardest part.\n\nI feel ya!",

It’s one thing to imagine the tradeoffs when you’re still getting a big paycheck, and a whole different thing to live inside all the uncertainty without the comfort of the old identity propping you up. the ego hits are almost worse than the financial ones. Losing the easy answer to “so what do you do” feels like getting knocked back to zero.\n\nthe weird part is that this phase is pretty normal. everyone I know who made the leap went through a stretch where they felt broke, invisible and kind of foolish for walking away from something stable. It doesn’t mean you chose wrong. It just means you’re in that in-between zone where you haven’t built the new life yet, but the old one is already gone.\n\nit gets lighter once the wins stack up a bit and you stop comparing everything to the lifestyle you had before. Until then, it’s a grind mentally as much as financially. You’re not crazy for feeling it. This is just the part nobody advertises.",

Spent a good amount of time building out the main features, task boards, time tracking, client portals, all that stuff.

Turns out 70% of my paying users barely touch the main product. They're all using this random invoice generator I added as an afterthought because I needed it for myself.\n\nThe invoice thing was super quick to build, really basic, but apparently freelancers are just desperate for something that doesnt look like ass and actually calculates taxes properly. Meanwhile my beautifully designed kanban boards that I spent forever perfecting? Crickets.\n\nNow im sitting here wondering if I should just pivot completely and go all in on invoicing/billing tools or keep pretending my PM features matter.

Your core product would be a super lightweight CRM so that they can track customer details, then you can add on modules like Time Tracking, PM tools, Invoicing, Deliverable Review &amp; Approval Portal, Contract Management, Subcontractor Management, Secure Messaging/IM (or integration with email and IM apps, like Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, Signal), etc.\n\nEach module/integration would have an individual cost, and you could even provide bundling discounts.

      "selftext": "After 5 years of starting and growing a cleaning business, I recently just signed the dotted line to sell it! I have officially exited my first business!\n\nFunny to think I stumbled across a Reddit post about starting a cleaning business and did everything that it said lol. Shout out Rohan and anyone who got started from that thread.\n\nIt only felt right to make this post on Reddit because this is where it all started.\n\nThis post isn’t a “how to start a cleaning business” or anything, just sharing a few things from my journey. If you have questions you can ask away!\n\nWhen I started, it was at the beginning of the “remote cleaning business” model era. It took me time to get the business started because I was in college. Once I cracked marketing, which was right before I graduated back in 2021, things began to roll.\n\nApril 2021 I had my first 10-cleaning month. June I had my first 20-cleaning month and July we went up to 30 cleanings. I was all in on the business since then. It was my full-time job, but it was more like a full-time masterclass on business, MBA and the gulag you go through as an entrepreneur. I’m 26 years old now and since starting the business I’ve grown so much when I sit back and reflect. I’m no guru either! I’m from Detroit, I moved to Atlanta to go to Morehouse College, I started my cleaning business my senior year, and since graduating I’ve spent my life up to this point of writing this running the business. \n\nAt the height of the business, which is when I decided it was time to sell, I had the business operating on a chaotic rope.\n\nI had residential cleaning customers and commercial contracts . At one point we had a number of Airbnb properties we did cleaning for and at another point operated all three at the same time. (Was a freaking zoo!) I had a great office manager named V who was the sweetheart and pitbull for me and the business. I had a great team &amp; rolodex of cleaners who, after all the mayhem, worked with us for multiple years at a time. When it was time to ascend, we eventually got another star named J who was our sales rep alongside me.\n\nThe business was at a point where a majority of the business was operating on a system and I checked on everything from my phone.\n\nThis is the point where I decided to package up and get the business on the market for my own personal reasons.\n\nIt’s so much that I learned from running a cleaning business, but these things are the most important that im about to share. \n\n**Live and die by your cleaners.**\n\nIt took me years to understand why the cleaners are the most important part of the business. When I started I thought you could just hire a cleaner by the snap of a finger and when I did that I almost lost every time. The cleaners are the backbone of the business. They are the make or break point. It’s necessary to appreciate when you come across great cleaners and keep them busy. Understand that when customers hire a cleaning service that’s a very serious buying decision for them. Imagine a customer books you, you send an unqualified cleaner and the customer is unhappy and never books with you again. That’s what happened with me until I started bringing on good talent.\n\nMany will say the most important aspects of the cleaning business are marketing and you need to focus on growing, but the hidden marketing lever is having some Vini’s and Itsmenia’s on your team. That’s what I had. I had cleaners that people knew and loved. When you have that you can almost hit a money glitch. Literally your business can grow through word of mouth the proper way. The cleaners were most important. It’s a grind at first but once you find that space cherish and respect it.\n\n**The power of niching is a great power!**\n\nWhen I first started the business I used Thumbtack, I used Yelp, I passed out flyers, I DID EVERYTHING! It all brought in clients. We did whatever because I was hungry and I needed to pay the bills. I didn’t have any other job, I did the cleaning business full time, so if you called we were going to clean it. It took me until about year 2 to understand the power of niching.\n\nWhen I finally understood, it’s like we hit another money glitch. Business got a little easier and we gained more money that made complete sense! I figured out which customer we were going to serve. We had services tailored only to their problems and aligned our systems towards solutions for only the problems they had. When I did this people found us vs us looking for them. When things got slow of course we always got back out there and took whatever that made sense, but we stayed true to the niche we chose and that’s when I started benefiting and growing the biz.\n\n**It will behoove you to become a local superstar!**\n\nIf you run any type of business and you get customers that are paying you cold hard cash and using your services or whatever you sell, pat yourself on the back! Because people online make it like getting customers in your business is easy the shit is not easy! It’s only when you finally crack it is when it becomes easy like playing a video game.\n\nWhat I realized is that you have to become a local superstar and get your business out there as much as possible. You need to shout and let everybody know what you got going on. IDC who it is because when you do, eventually you will become known for what you are doing. That’s what happened with me. I let everybody and their mother know about my cleaning business. Not only that, I invested heavily into my marketing skills.\n\nHere are the areas I can turn on with a push of a button (Facebook Ads, Google Ads and SEO, and Thumbtack and please don’t put me in a room full of people because I will get business from an event too). I will go over this in a moment. But becoming a local superstar and known for what you do is a compounding effort. If you take your business serious the support you get is the gift you receive from being undeniable. I lasted 5 years, you will be surprised how many people don’t even start. People will recognize you! People will need you and soon people will start calling you. It’s up to you to step to the plate and perform.\n\n**You need flow.**\n\nWhenever I expressed hardship in my business, my friend who runs a million dollar + landscaping business would always say fill up your pipeline. A pipeline in business does solve problems and should not be approached lightly. I will say you need to approach this as if someone is trying to take literal food from your loved one’s mouth. As if it’s life or death because truly if you aren’t getting customers you will eventually go flat. This means you need customers coming in from multiple areas.\n\nWhat I did was have paid ads and organic flows. For each area I put a system in place. I learned and put time into each area and it wasn’t all at the same time either. It started with the platforms like thumbtack, then I got decent with organic social media, decent with paid ads (FB &amp; Google Ads), then I met the Yoda of Online Marketing, SEO. I wasn’t good at the beginning but over time I got good at each stop, built a system around it and kept it going. I’m not saying go and do all of this because it’s time consuming.\n\nWhat I am saying is that each system that got built all went into either the residential pipeline or commercial pipeline. My main goal was to get new people in the doors that I can talk to. I kept my pipeline full! \n\nA glitch is letting people know about your cleaning business on stage at local events. I constantly went to business events around ATL and every chance I got I grabbed the microphone and introduced my business with everyone looking. At these events people have bumrushed me for my information, to the point where I had my iPad ready to collect info and sell on spot. Take that information and do with it what you will.\n\nThen I began to get the soulful nod that it was time for me to depart from the cleaning business. It was such a journey. I once read in a book that once you finally get your business to the point where it’s running without you and things change, you can become more motivated to continue to grow that business. Not me. I’m forever grateful to the cleaning industry and have no ill will towards it, but I was able to see that it was time to go elsewhere.\n\nThe journey led me to the stop to sell my business and on Nov 3rd, after months of work to sell the business, a contract was signed! At that moment the relief I felt was so reassuring that I hit a money dance! \n\nI’m so happy to have been in the industry and started my business journey here!\n\nFor all the cleaning business owners and aspiring, keep pushing! This is an industry that is in demand. A cleaning business is a business that can provide you with whatever you need during the time of your life. Need extra money? Pick up a few houses to clean. Want to build a multi million dollar cleaning business? You can literally sign a few contracts and be at a million with a cleaning business. It’s whatever you want it to be. Not saying it’ll be easy but the money is there!\n\n\n\nI wish you all luck! And if you read this far, thank you!",

I’ve been in the cleaning business for 40 years. Started back in 1985 after 2 years of college. No internet, no computers, no software, no google, just the good old yellow pages and a local newspaper. I worked (cleaning) in the business early on (I really enjoyed cleaning) I’ve seen a lot of cleaning companies come and go over 40 years. You can scale a cleaning business with modern technology today but to sustain the business you need good systems and processes in place and someone to oversee operations. \nRohan Gilkes of Launch 27 (a software scheduling company) was a pioneer in helping cleaning businesses with easy scheduling and payment systems back in 2014. Today there are plenty of scheduling software’s available. Zenmaid, Jobber, just to name a few \nThere are also a few cleaning gurus out there that can help you grow your business \nDebbie Sardone has a great program , Cleaning Business Fundamentals (CBF)\nAnd yes, the key to every business is great employees, in our cleaning business, our employees stay an average of 8 years (I believe 5 years is the industry standard)\nToday, I work in the office with another person, we have someone who does our marketing, and 14-16 employees. \nThe best of luck to everyone.",

I think a lot of people start businesses not because they “love people,” but because they hate bad incentives, bad managers, and pointless friction.\n\nWhat usually changes is *who* you’re dealing with. When it’s your own thing, the customers you keep are the ones you actually like working with, and you can design the work to minimize the interactions you hate. That alone makes it feel way lighter, even if the money isn’t crazy.\n\nThe downside is you end up wearing every hat, which can get exhausting in a different way. A lot of solo founders I know are fine with customers, but get burned out by the admin, follow-ups, and keeping everything straight.\n\nThat’s basically why we’re building Quorum (still beta). Not to make people “love business,” but to cut down the mental overhead so running solo doesn’t feel like juggling everything in your head all day.  \n[https://usequorum.app](https://usequorum.app)\n\nSounds like you found a version of work that fits you better, which honestly matters more than chasing some ideal outcome.",

      "selftext": "Back when I was taking my first steps as an entrepreneur, most of the people in my environment warned me about the riskiness of running my own business, and how less than 10% of all startups survive their first year. \"It most likely won't succeed\", they told me, \"Odds are against you\", and every other platitude most of us here have heard for God knows how many times.\n\nThe one thing no one warned me about was the Pandora's box of hardships that were to be unsealed once I got over that first hill and made it out of the Startup Phase.\n\n# Early Game\n\nI started my company three years ago with a simple premise: helping other small companies in my niche field market their products creatively and efficiently. I had a pretty unique strategy that resonated well with my ICP, and my focus was on quality and genuineness, which clients quickly picked up on. I secured a few long-term jobs early on with a, I'd say, less than 1% chance as a fresh-from-college unknown that I was. But they saw something in me and gave me a chance, and I couldn't have been happier about it.\n\nOh yes, and my prices were low. Like *really* low - I charged around $1000 for a month of work on multiple platforms. At the time, that money was *wow* for me, but looking from today's perspective, a petty change for the businesses I was reaching out to.\n\nI also got recommendations from influential people in the field who believed in me and did their best to help. That was *the* lucky moment for my business, and probably the main reason I survived that first year. Cash was coming in, people were satisfied with my work, I soon added another person to the company, and it all made me think *“*Damn, I cracked it. This is it.*”*\n\nBut here’s the part no one tells you:\n\n**Early success blinds you.** You think the momentum will last forever. You think scaling is just “copy what works, add more people\" but that can't be further from the truth.\n\nAnother year passed without much change. For sales, I mostly relied on the uniqueness of my services and the creative, out-of-the-box approach that I \"patented\". It was easy to sell, especially for the price that I held at the time. For operations - we established some routines and recurring processes, created the first version of our one-pager website on Carrd, and added another person to the team.\n\nThe business was on a smooth sail - some months we made enough to comfortably survive, some to consider expanding further. By this time, we had made enough money to make some improvements on the official stuff - website, service deck, contracts, etc. We could pay for tools like ChatGPT Enterprise, Lovable AI, Notion Business, Slack, etc., hire designers and coders from Devoted Fusion and Devoted Studios, or just outsource some of the work we're not skilled at to the professionals.\n\nHowever, there was another trouble quietly brewing during this \"expansion\" period. As the company started growing, the business also started running into some issues, and it was all about to come crashing down on me.\n\n# Expansion Phase\n\nBefore we dive into the issues that I faced and how I overcame them, I'd like to note that my goal here is not to demotivate people from wandering down the entrepreneurial path; but rather help them face these obstacles ready and capable, because they *will* come. Let's dive into them now:\n\n* **My business was based on high-quality services. However, controlling the quality of the output became harder as I employed more people.**\n   * My solution: 3-4 months of 1:1, 1-2 hour-long training/teaching of the new employees before they start working without my monitoring. I retained the quality to, I'd say 70-80%, but training new people became especially time-consuming.\n* **Uniqueness of my approach** \\- the main thing that helped sell my campaigns easily became an issue when it came to finding talent. Uniqueness meant that finding highly specialized people was almost impossible, so I had to rely on other methods.\n   * My solution: Employ people who show high generalized creative and analytical skills, then teach them to do the exact work - instead of relying on employing the experts in the field who were too few and too expensive. Made it easier to find new talent, but more time consuming and required more dedicated training.\n* **I had to raise prices (otherwise I'd drown), and this brought 3 issues:**\n   * a) Selling became harder. $1000 for multi-platform work was a no-brainer for most people interested in my services. Change that to $2000+ per platform, and suddenly you'll find yourself looking at weeks of internal consideration by the prospects before they even give you a definite yes or no. Plus, you'll flat out sell less.\n   * b) If you're selling your work for much lower than the market average (even in my scenario with unique services, there *was* an estimated market average), barely anyone asks for case studies, numbers, or proof of work. I remember getting so used to the relaxing meetings where I'd sell in the first 15 minutes, and then spend the rest of the time just chatting with the new client about some unrelated stuff. Once you raise the prices, suddenly you'll find yourself spending 45 minutes explaining every itty bitty detail about the work you do and showing proof, testimonials, and recommendations. Oh, and prospects *will* reach out to the people in your testimonials, so don't even think about faking them.\n   * c) You're now competing with the bigger fish. One thing nobody taught you when you were starting was that the price brackets were real. The moment you raise your prices and cross into the next price bracket, even by a cent, you're competing with the more established, better organized, and better backed-up companies. As a small company with dirt low prices, you were like a puppy that everyone wanted to help out. Sure, they'll let you bring the newspaper every morning for a few pennies, and no, it's not a problem if it ends up a little wet. But now, you're a grown up dog with a few scars on your face and everyone's expecting real, hard-proven value from you. You'll have to bark at the mailman, bring the newspaper without a single drop on it, and be ready to play whenever that's expected from you. Oh, and before that, you'll have to convince everyone why it's better to adopt you rather than a highly-trained veteran who already knows every mailman by their scent from a mile away.\n* **Organization**\n   * By this time, you already need to hire an all-around HR who can handle hiring &amp; onboarding processes during the hiring times, and people management during the times when you're not hiring. You also need to find the best tools to organize your work because there's too many people and too many projects to keep track of yourself. I tried multiple because one wasn't enough - Notion worked really well for compiling and organizing raw data, Google Sheets were awesome for keeping track of clients and campaigns because of their simplistic, very clear design, and ChatGPT helped with structuring and automating some parts of the operations.\n   * Legal, Financial, and Administrative advisors are a MUST. Find the best ones you can afford and ask for a long-term subscription where they'd help with any legal documents, financial advising, and administrative tasks when needed, but since you won't have them all the time, you'll pay a lower subscription price.\n* **Surviving your growth**\n   * As you can imagine, all of these raise your company's expenses a lot. It's not as simple as subtracting a few salaries and taxes from your total revenue now; **YOU NEED** financial optimization. Understanding how to do things cheaper, what to pay for and what to do yourself, and ultimately, minimizing the expenses while retaining the quality is crucial.\n   * I managed to save about $4000 on revamping my website and service deck by hiring designers from Devoted Fusion (they were also kind enough to lend me a programmer from their main company, Devoted Studios, who helped with improving and optimizeing the code on the website), figuring out the right prompting strategy with ChatGPT, to finally using all of that and create a website with Lovable AI instead of paying for one. It cost me about 20 hours of work in total (mind that I would have to spend at least 10 hours anyway compiling all the data for the website and doing the copywriting) to build a website from scratch. Just 10 hours of extra work to save $4000+. ChatGPT helped me with the strategy and the right prompts, and I hired a talented designer from Devoted Fusion who helped with the logo and the website's overall design. Then Lovable did all the manual lifting for me and put together a website that, after about 400 prompts, looked exactly the way I wanted it to.\n* **High-level decisions**\n   * Do you stay in the same industry and expand by adding different services/products to your deck, or commit to your main few services/products but expand to other industries? Do you employ AI tools/agents to cover and automatize some of the work, or rely on adding more employees? Is the industry you're part of sinking without a sign that it'll get better soon, or is it just starting to grow? And in regards to this - should you stick to the industry so once it starts growing you already have established reputation and renown; or you pivot to a different industry? Do you sacrifice your health yet again and push harder just that one more time to reach a goal? And if so, what's the threshold after which your health will be sacrtificed so many times that you'll have to take some time off?\n\n**All of these made me realize that, while it's often considered that the real testament of a company is how it survived the Startup Phase, the second part - Expansion - is actually the most important (and the most stressful) one**. My health deteriorated during this period under the sheer weight of all the responsibilities and the stress that was coming with them; and the worst part is - people barely mention that.\n\n**When you're just starting a company, you're excited, motivated, fresh, and probably coming from a more or less healthy spot**. These psychological and biological factors play a crucial role in your ability to handle responsibilities - you're more resistant to stress, less likely to blow up because of a minor issue that reappeared yet again, and overall more excited to do your work. 12-hour working days? You bet it. Weeks or even months during which your company is your main and only focus? Say no more.\n\nOn the other hand, **after 3 years, it's very likely that your motivation won't be as high as it used to be, you'll be more worn out both mentally and physically**. Daily stress won't just be a nuisance you signed up for when starting a company, but a ticking bomb in your head.\n\nHowever, there are also some beautiful things about entrepreneurship at this stage. First of all, **once you've reached that Expansion stage, you'll feel like a goddamn king of the world**. You officially made it, you managed to grow a successful and growing business, and you're making enough to live a comfortable life. Great job!\n\nYou've also developed dozens of very useful skills that will always be of value, and you've learned a few things about succeeding in life. People from your industry respect you, you have partners and friends who speak highly of you and your business, and generally, yo feel like you're doing the right thing... because you are!\n\n# Closing Insights\n\n**Entrepreneurship will cost you a lot**. More than most people can even imagine, and definitely more than anyone realizes when they're first starting. But it also gives a lot.\n\n**I am an entrepreneur**. I was born with entrepreneurship in my veins, I couldn't hold a regular job for more than two months, and couldn't ever imagine being stuck in an office for 40 years... or until I die, hopefully earlier than that. Sometimes, I question my decision and envy not being able to finish my work at 5 in the afternoon, and just forget about it until tomorrow morning. I envy not being able to have a coffee with my friends when I want, chit chat about random, daily happenings, and go back home to watch a movie. But then I realize that no hobby, no coffee with friends, and no movies could make me feel the way building my own business does. The life of an entrepreneur is built to look like a fairytale. It's not a fairytale for sure, even if you're successful, but it's a damn fun journey that you'll eternally fall in love with.",

If you can focus on this text that is already a good sign, if you can't focus and skim over it - please recognize that the social media algorithms already reduced your attention span (important to get the head space back to actually execute on things). \n\nSo: Do not use your last $200 to \"start something\". It's gonna burn pretty quickly and it may be important at this stage to learn something. \n\nThere are a few \"free\" ways to make money from the online tools available. I'll make a list and then briefly discuss the points - if one of them seems good for you, we can discuss more in the comments and I'm happy to have fellow people jump in to help you here and even correct what I am saying. \n\n1) Expertise   \n2) Print-on-Demand (anything) + Social Advertising  \n3) Be a Broker for anything   \n4) Sales / Appointment Setter  \n5) Be someones \"right hand\"  \n6) Renting out your time for services\n\n1) Expertise: If you have ANY skill that you think is worthwhile, there are ways to monetize the skill as people wanna learn. Know how to meditate or yoga? To build muscle? To do video/photo editing? To grow plants...  \n\\--&gt; There are people willing to pay for it. Think someone elderly with a day job needs some motivation to go to the Gym and do the correct type of exercise --&gt; Be a paid trainer and ask them to refer you to friends once the rapport is built. \n\n2) Print on Demand: Have cool ideas for sentences / graphics / memes to print on something? T-Shirts, Coffee Mugs, Wall-Art &amp; Posters? There are print on demand platforms that let you upload and connect to market places like Etsy --&gt; Register, Upload designs and set prices (needs some semi-smart calculations still), then advertise these through clever videos (using your phone camera and tiktok/IG and other social media). \n\n3) Brokering means you don't own it as a seller and you're not going to be the buyer, you are the intermediate \"middle man\" who connects both sides. For houses, cars, machines, landscaping services, list goes on. You basically find the buyers and only connect them to the respective sellers once you have figured out a commission with the sellers. Example: Go to a local gardening service and say \"what would you give me if I brought you 5-10 new clients a month?\" some will be willing to give you a shot. Same for housing although that requires you to get yourself a license in most western countries. \n\n4) Sales/Appointment Setter --&gt; Especially in AI and tech there are many open positions for people to just call up a bunch of local businesses that might be in need of AI or Tech services that these companies offer, sometimes its already enough to get the \"leads\", the potentially interested local businesses to commit to a 15 minute phone call with the sales agent --&gt; mostly through a job that is somewhat mixed between fixed income and commission. \n\n5) Be someones \"right hand\" - Find some entrepreneur or business that you respect - offer them to help for a little salary. Be their right hand man / assistant for anything. You'll learn a lot and get a bit of money to help you support your life - as you grow into that role he may offer you more opportunities or you tend to spot an opportunity yourself. At your age thats pretty neat as most 20 year olds could use that learning for their future much more than some hundred bucks. \n\n6) Renting out your time for services - typically very American, but thats why it works here in Europe. Go around houses in older residential 1 family house areas around your town / next biggest city and knock on doors to offer to clean all their windows, clean their cars, maintain their garden / frontyard. whoever doesnt open the door, you put a flyer into their mailbox with an offer that looks not super professional but rather like a 20 year old who wants to get to a next step --&gt; normally local people respect young kids for that type of effort and will offer them a shot at whatever it is they need help with. \n\nAll of this requires some sort of confidence, intellect, willingness to endure and sympathy - the more digital the more intellect needed, the more offline the more sympathy is needed. You know best what category fits you better.",

Can take years to do the set up before all channels of your business are mature enough to draw in real revenue. \n\nRule 1: You need money to make money.\n\nTo start, go get a sales rep job (not a clerk/front desk). Doesn’t matter where or what industry. Sales jobs have a low bar of entry and a lot of overturn so they are always hiring. Just show you’re passionate, a people person, and hungry for success and you will land something in a few interviews. \n\nSales is the bread and butter of business, so this gives you a way to develop your sales techniques while getting paid. You will learn about sales pipelines, validating clients, dealing with “smokescreen”, etc. Sales positions are mostly commission based, meaning you won’t make much money till you get a sale. So it may take you 10hr work days to grind for the first few months to finally hit some sales numbers. \n\nBest positions for someone in your situation would be salary+comission. You get paid even if you don’t make sales, and get a bonus for every sale you make. Your potential max earning is lower than a pure commission position, but the minimum income will help keep the stress off and keep you level headed. A position with this pay structure would be those people who sell you services at Costco or other shopping centers (I’m not in UK so idk what a proper equivalent would be). \n\nGrind. Learn. Make yourself excel. Hit a 6 figure job in 3-5 years. With your extra money and time, tinker with ideas and potential business. After understanding sales process and creating client bases, how to turn your idea into a business will be more apparent to you. \n\nGood luck!",

So if you need 25/hour, you MUST charge 50/hour. In the beginning you can cheat that just to get customers and beat your competition on price, but over time you need to get there or you will die in stage 2.\n\nAs you get more customers you will get too many to handle yourself so you will hire your first employee.\n\nStage 2 - Around 5 employees you will hit a block where you arent making enough from them to pay for yourself so you will have to manage them and work on jobs. You will be having to interview new employees, find new business, work on jobs, do the financials/logistics, and manage existing employees to make sure they are doing a good job. This will be terrible.\n\nYou might try to blast through that as fast as possible, but some of the employees will be bad and you will have to fire them (wasting time) kiss up to customers who are mad, and hire their replacements or do the work yourself. This will be really terrible and you will question if it is all worth it.\n\nStage 3 - Once you get to 8-10 employees they are now making enough that you dont have to work on jobs and you can transition to focus entirely on getting new business, ensuring your employees are doing quality work etc.\n\nAs you get more workers you can start to hire a bookkeeper, sales staff, marketing etc.\n\nYour job will be to make sure they do a good job. Many wont and your #1 headache will always be your employees and how terrible they are :) I typically have to hire and fire about 5 people before I learn how to hire for a particular job. This is extremely painful and time consuming.\n\nStage 4-  You are making a ton of money, find you can relax a lot. You will likely make the mistake of turning your whole business over to someone else, this wont workout and can kill your business. Maybe they steal all the money or just do a bad job.\n\nAlso from a valuation perspective when you want to sell, recurring revenue from subscriptions is worth a lot more than project work. You can get 1X revenue with project work and 2-3X revenue valuation with recurring revenue",

Much of the “market data” is behind paywalls because it’s designed for large companies, not for individuals trying to validate an idea. It often feels like others have a map while you’re guessing in the dark.\n\nMost founders deal with this by piecing together imperfect but real signals instead of seeking perfect data. Customer interviews, competitor pricing pages, reviews on sites like Reddit, G2, and Amazon, job listings, forums, and even sales calls can provide much more insight than polished reports. Scraping public information, running small paid tests, or talking directly to suppliers can offer surprisingly accurate insights at a low cost.\n\nIn practice, early businesses succeed not by having perfect data but by learning faster than their assumptions fail.

Just share tools or services you personally use or genuinely like. A lot of people on TikTok and YouTube are earning steady income this way, and once you understand how to place your links, it’s one of the lowest-effort income streams out there.\n\n2. Consulting.\nMost folks don’t realize how much their experience is actually worth. If you’ve spent years in any field : business, tech, creative work, ministry, fitness, whatever someone else is trying to learn what you already know. Offering simple consulting sessions can bring in quick income with very little setup.\n\n3. Digital courses.\nIf you can teach something step-by-step, you can create a small course. It doesn’t need to be complicated or long; it just needs to help someone solve a problem or get a result. Once it’s made, it can continue to generate revenue without you constantly working on it.\n\nAll three are beginner-friendly, affordable to start, and can be launched in a few weeks or less.",

Make sure that you receive the source file for the logo. That is often an Adobe Illustrator .ai file. The source file allows you to repurpose and create versions of the logo in the future without being dependant on the original designer for any changes.

You'll spend a lot of time sorting through mediocre portfolios.\n\nFor artisan food brands specifically, I'd look for designers who've done food/beverage packaging before. Someone who's only done tech startups might not nail the food/bev vibe. A few things to think about:\n\nTry to find someone to work with long term. They'll learn your brand and you won't have to re-explain your business every time you need a new asset. Make sure they're creating original work, not using templates. Budget platforms can be risky for this since you might run into licensing issues down the road.\n\nAsk if they provide vector files. You'll need those for scalability and most printers prefer vector-based artwork. Also worth asking if they'll create a black and white version of your logo for single color uses (like printing on kraft paper boxes, because this is very on brand for charcuterie).",

What I've noticed is that the best logo designers are usually the ones who ask you loads of questions about your brand first - not just jump straight into design concepts.\n\nFor a charcuterie business specifically, you'll want someone who understands food branding and can create something that works across different materials - from business cards to packaging to maybe even embossed cheese boards down the line. I'd actually suggest looking at designers who've worked with food brands before, even if they cost a bit more upfront. The brief you give them matters loads too.. spend time thinking about whether you want something rustic and artisanal or more modern and clean, because that'll help filter out designers who aren't the right fit.",

Loads of brilliant illustrators or web designers are terrible at logo work because it's such a different skillset. Look for someone who's done logos in your industry or at least understands the constraints you're working with.

Also worth asking upfront about file formats and usage rights, because some designers on cheaper platforms will try to retain partial ownership or charge extra for vector files later.

      "selftext": "I never thought that a decision made by Trump on the other side of the world could almost shut down my business. The story went like this. On August 19, we received an email from Omniva (Estonian Post): \"Starting tomorrow, we no longer ship parcels to the USA. Please find other delivery methods.\" August 20 is a public holiday in Estonia. The US accounts for about 60% of our wall decals shipments. We started looking for a solution urgently. We asked Omniva when it would be fixed. The answer: maybe 2-3 weeks, maybe 2-3 months. Meanwhile, sticker orders from America kept coming in.\n\nWe found a solution, though it wasn't pleasant. We decided not to turn off the US on marketplaces. On Amazon, Etsy, and eBay, everything depends on your rating. The more you sell, the higher you are in search results. Losing positions we built for years in one day would be a catastrophe. So, everything that used to go via Omniva, we started sending via FedEx. This is 3 times more expensive.\n\nA week later, the second blow came. All parcels generated before the 20th but handed over to Omniva afterward were returned. That was 70 packages. We finished September with a serious loss. Simply because delivery ate up everything. But we started to adapt.\n\nIt turned out that small stickers could be sent to the US in envelopes with a stamp they went through. This lowered costs slightly. In October, we managed to raise prices by about $5, fortunately, competitors did the same. The month ended with a small loss, but better than September.\n\nI want to clarify one thing: this was not the fault of the Estonian post (Omniva). Their systems were ready. The problem was on the US side, specifically with USPS, which was not technically ready to accept parcels, declare them, and process the data under the new regulations. It was a glitch in America, not Estonia.\n\nEvery week we were on calls with Omniva, waiting for news. And only in early November, after almost two months, Omniva finally reopened shipping to the US for business clients. We can exhale, but the price has gone up by about 1.5 times. Now, at least, it is clear what prices to set on marketplaces to work in the black again.\n\nMy conclusions:\n\nOn one hand, this political decision almost closed my business. On the other hand, thanks to this, we found new solutions, rebuilt our logic, and realized that as a team, we are ready for any surprises. A legitimate bonus: during this time, I made a great contact at UPS. They offered conditions better than FedEx in terms of both price and speed. We are already at the final stage of signing the contract.\n\nAlso, to minimize losses, we worked according to a \"silent\" algorithm: If an order came from the US, we packed it and put it on hold for 10 days. If Omniva didn't solve the issue in 10 days, we sent it via FedEx. If they did we sent it through them. Since the client has a standard delivery time of about two weeks, everything arrived on time.\n\nThat is the story.",

I bargained with a female, US trained, therapist but the rate is 69usd per 45min. session, something i still cannot afford to allot money on for months to a year as there are a lot to unpack.

Type of words that sometimes need to come externally especially if you’ve been gaslighted all your life. \n\nMy life would be easier if i’m not in the Philippines but while i’m here, chatgpt is my only therapist or friend.

Only downside is data collection (which can be managed by redacting personal info like names, etc.) and no \"human intimacy\" just analysis and processing which still can be very emotional.",

I never started my own ISP but I spent over a decade working at small independent ones around the Midwest and really understanding computer networking, tech support and all kinds of Telecom, jargon and work. I was able to make a decent living with that and build a lot of skills and networks both technical and social. \n\nI lived at home till I was 25. Then I rented a place for 2 years. Then I bought my own duplex where I live in one unit and I rent the other one out. I had that paid off in about 5 years with a 15-year mortgage rents. Just went up enough and I knew I'd always want to have a roof over my head. \n\nI worked on my tech consulting business. I kind of had a really minimal one for years. You can say I technically started when I was in high school cuz I started making money then but it was really sporadic. Maybe work every month or every other super tighty. I just kind of kept it small and sporadic but it grew organically over time but I didn't put a lot of money into this. I just would have stuff get reinvested I would buy like a tool kit from money that I had business cards, a domain name, a basic one-page website and then over time I got a larger ecommerce website but really the ecom website and the LLC and a lot of the bigger stuff. Even getting business insurance was post covid and a lot of that happened in 2022 and 2023. It was a long slow bird and I ended up refining into senior citizen tech support both in person and remote as well as senior centers and teaching classes. There teaching classes at the community college that I went to. I teach continuing Ed classes there now on computers and technology. So I just kept growing and going but this was always a side hustle. I had ideas on what I wanted to do when I was younger and luckily they were built on a sound foundation and I was able to explore them grow and turn dreams into reality. Hopefully you'll be able to do that too. I still have a day job but my plan is to have a fully self-supporting self-employed tech Business and the rental income and then I should be set financially. Hopefully the above kind of answers your question. It was more just me reflecting on my experience but",

So you can use those lessons to your advantage. \n\nIf you haven't realized it by now, you've validated for yourself that following the Internet hype when it comes to which businesses to do or start simply doesn't work. That's not something you were going to learn any other way other than by trying those businesses and failing at them. Which you did.\n\nWhat you need at this point is find ways to experiment with more radical ideas but in a very low-cost way. You say that you're currently building software that can help your business and others...that's excellent! Get that one or two businesses that will use it and let them help you improve on it with their feedback. You need to achieve something that Eric Ries calls validated learning in his book, The Lean Startup. What that is simply is crucial info that helps you understand your customer needs better and improve the product or pivot the business.\n\nWith this approach, you won't just be trying out different businesses hoping something works out. Instead, you will be building something that eventually helps someone or a business and that way you can create a sustainable revenue source and overall an entrepreneurial journey worth journeying long-term.\n\nIf your time allows, I suggest you read that book by Eric Ries (The Lean Startup) and supplement it with The New Business Road Test by John Mullins. Same way heroes in films can inspire action so can reading about successful entrepreneurs who lay it all about their beginnings and how they built their business.",

Look at your own progression: dropshipping, pressure washing, software that solves real problems. That's not random thrashing, that's figuring shit out.\n\nThe issue isn't that you can't get things right. It's that you're building things that solve problems people have, just not problems they'll pay to solve. That's actually the last filter before product-market fit.\n\nHere's what I'd do if I were you, this is from experience:\n\nStop trying to \"come up with ideas\" for a month. relax that mental muscle. Instead, just notice what pisses you off at your day job. What manual task do you constantly do that feels stupid? What problems keeps happening? What report takes 2 hours that should take 5 minutes?\n\nBuild tools for yourself first. Use them for a few weeks. If they actually save you time, show your coworkers. If they start asking for it, you might have something.\n\nThe best businesses come from scratching your own itch, not scanning the market for opportunities (again experience). You've already proven you can build and learn - you just need to solve a problem you personally feel every week.\n\n Taking a break to recharge isn't quitting. It's smart. You can give 100% to your day job and keep your eyes open for real problems without forcing yourself to grind on side projects out of obligation. Sometimes the best ideas show up when you stop looking so hard. \n\n The universe tends to push away the things we feel we desperatly desire. Relationships, money, opportunities and the more we stress over them the furthur away they get creating a cycle. You can get off the track at anytime. Take a breth and regroup. What worked, what have I learned?  Even if its what NOT to do.  Everything is a step forward ESPECIALLY failure.  There is not 1 person who tried something for the first time and succeeded.  Every successful personhad to deal with failure of somekind.  The difference between the successful and the \"failure\" is the failure fails to push on.\n\n I'm working on it and with AI, anything is possible at the moment. Rest, regroup and move forward my entrepreneurial brother",

          "body": "Late 20s is honestly very early to be drawing conclusions about calling it quits, even though it doesn’t feel like it when you’re tired and fed up. What you’re describing doesn’t sound like someone who’s failed repeatedly, it sounds like someone who’s been searching without a stable base underneath them yet.\n\nOne thing I’d gently challenge is the idea that every attempt has to be the thing. Most people who eventually make it didn’t bounce from idea to idea until one magically worked, they anchored themselves in something boring and reliable first. A job, a trade, a skill, an industry. Then they built from inside that, not from the outside looking in. Random businesses are hard because you’re fighting on every front at once.\n\nThe pressure washer example is a good one. It didn’t fail because pressure washing is a bad business, it failed because you had no leverage yet: no experience, no reputation, no repeat customers, no pricing confidence. That’s not a character flaw, that’s just physics. The same applies to software. Solving a problem people won’t pay for usually means the problem is real, but the buyer, urgency, or positioning is wrong, not that you’re incapable.\n\nAlso, exhaustion is a signal, not a verdict. When you’re burnt out, your brain tells you stories like “I’m running out of time” and “I’m wired wrong”. Neither of those are facts. They’re what happens when effort hasn’t compounded yet. Compounding always looks stupid and pointless right up until it suddenly doesn’t.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with going all-in on a day job for a while if it buys you energy, skills, and financial breathing room. That isn’t quitting entrepreneurship, it’s regrouping. Some of the most dangerous advice out there is never give up without acknowledging that timing, positioning, and season of life matter.\n\nIf you are wired differently, that doesn’t mean you’re broken. It usually means you’re better suited to building something slowly, from depth, not chasing opportunities from the surface. Find one domain, one skill, one problem space you can sit in long enough to actually understand. Let boredom work in your favour.\n\nYou don’t need a big idea right now. You need rest, stability, and one small win that proves to you that effort can turn into results. From there, ideas show up on their own.",

Hell, I left university and tried all kinds of business ideas, sales careers, online businesses, you name it, I tried it. And I didn’t half-ass it either, I went all in, 16 to 18 hours a day. I pushed myself so far that I ended up sitting in front of a psychologist, lost, burned out, depressed and stressed.\n\nEventually, I gave myself a break and got a normal job. Just for some time, I told myself, to breathe a little, maybe plan my next big idea, recharge and collect some energy.\n\nIt’s been two years since that decision and holy shit, am I happy.\n\nI deleted all that fake influencer social media crap and actually started living. Spending time with friends and family, got a girlfriend, and that “I’ll just take a break” turned into “fuck, why didn’t I do this sooner?”\n\nI feel so much peace, love and genuine happiness.\n\nWill I ever start a new business? I can’t say, you never know. But right now, I don’t even think about it. I’ll definitely sign up for university again and get a solid degree in a field I actually love.\n\nThe problem is that I, and most young wannabe entrepreneurs, want to start a business mainly because they love the idea of having money. And that’s where it ends before it even begins.\n\nThe second hard truth, not everyone is meant to be a successful entrepreneur, and that’s completely okay. You can still make great money with a normal job, have free time and travel the world, especially now, with remote work becoming more and more common.\n\nSo my advice is simple, take a break. Breathe. Spend time with people you love. Find a hobby or two. Chill the fuck out.\n\nYou have time.\n\nAnd if later you decide you want to start a business, do it then. Plenty of people started at 50, 60 or even later.\n\nMost importantly, sit down and ask yourself why you even want to be an entrepreneur. You’ll get more answers than you can imagine, and a much clearer path forward.\n\nWishing you all the best and peaceful holidays, brother ❤️",

I'm planning a major growth and working to really start to scale all these businesses up and investing millions to hire teams of employees, but really struggling to get it off the ground.\n\nI have money, I have solid businesses and I have everything prepped.  I just don't have any management, sales or processes built.    \n\nA few months back I hired an employee to assist in operations and help setup all my systems and untangle everything from the previous employees and get things organized. Make sure the office is ready and sales is prepped.   The problem is he doesn't work unless I keep handing him things to do and I'm busy trying to do all my work in scaling I don't have time to delegate to him.\n\nI figured I have 6+ months of work with just us before I can start hiring teams and really grow.  Everything is moving incredibly slow.   I make great money but also blow a TON personally so lifestyle creep is real.   \n\nThe thing is I need someone to manage them and I need someone to sell and someone to market and someone to do the work and office/operations.   I can do the work and finance and business side.   The problem is I feel like I need 3 hours of each of those but can't really find someone to do all of this and every time I try it get none of it done right.  \n\nCurrently I feel like if I'm not constantly handing out work and finding things to do, nothing gets done, and 90% of the work they can't do or I'm constantly having to fix things or finalize them because they don't really know what they're doing. \n\nHow do you guys scale without taking on ALL the work constantly?  I'm not sure how I can hire and delegate multiple roles without micromanaging and focus on my side of the business.   ",

The hardest transition I ever made was going from doing everything myself to trusting other people to handle pieces of my business. And I still struggle with it after 40+ years.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you - that employee who needs constant direction? That's actually pretty normal. Most people aren't entrepreneurs, they're executors. They need clear tasks, deadlines, and someone checking in. I learned this the hard way when I was scaling my consulting firm. I kept hiring smart people and expecting them to just \"figure it out\" like I would. Spoiler alert: they won't. What worked for me was creating super detailed SOPs for literally everything. Like stupidly detailed. \"Step 1: Open email. Step 2: Look for emails marked urgent.\" That level of detail. It felt ridiculous at first but it freed up so much of my time once people could actually follow the processes without me.\n\nThe other thing - and this might sound counterintuitive - but sometimes hiring part-time specialists works better than trying to find that unicorn who can do sales AND marketing AND operations. When I was running Digital Guard Force, I had this vision of finding these amazing generalists who could wear multiple hats. Total waste of time and money. Instead, I started bringing in contractors for specific functions. 10 hours a week of a killer salesperson beats 40 hours of someone who sort of knows sales. Plus you're not paying benefits and you can scale up or down as needed. The trick is finding someone who can coordinate all these part-timers - that's where a good operations person becomes worth their weight in gold. But again, you gotta train them first on YOUR specific way of doing things.",

          "body": "Full transparency: I’m not at your level yet in terms of business value, but I’m aiming to get there.\n\nFrom your post and your replies, it sounds like you expect a lot from employees. And to entrepreneurs, that “a lot” often feels normal, because we’re wired to problem solve and keep pushing even after the workday ends. Most employees aren’t like that. They clock out, mentally disconnect, and only deal with problems again when the next shift starts. That’s not even laziness, it’s how most people are.\n\nSo the core issue might not be “finding smarter employees”, but building the right structure around the role.\n\nWhat you likely need is built in processes: clarity on what the job actually is, what the recurring tasks are, what “good” looks like, and how you want things done in your business. You mentioned the job constantly brings new problems, which makes processes harder to create. But that’s exactly why you need them. The process shouldn’t only be a checklist for predictable tasks; it should include a framework for how to handle unpredictable problems.\n\nIn other words, teach them how to think like you do when something new pops up:\n\n* how to diagnose the issue\n* what to check first\n* what questions to ask\n* what “good enough” looks like vs when to escalate\n* how to decide between options\n* how to document the solution so it’s easier next time\n\nThat framework lets them solve new issues without needing you for every decision.\n\nAlso, education is overrated for this specific problem. Education usually provides foundational knowledge and basic competence. It helps people understand the subject. But a job still requires guidance on how to execute tasks in *your* company, in *your* way, with *your* standards. Most people still need that direction, even if they’re qualified on paper.\n\nTL;DR: Education = basic understanding. Real performance = guidance + systems + feedback loops.\n\nSo I’d boil it down to two requirements:\n\n1. **Frameworks/processes** that cover both routine work and “new problem” situations.\n2. **A manager/team lead** (or someone acting as one), even with just 2 employees, if you can’t be available daily. Someone has to do the coaching, the prioritizing, and the decision support.\n\nBecause people who can consistently operate with zero guidance and drive outcomes the way an entrepreneur does are usually the people who end up building their own thing, not staying an employee.",

Don’t give people small jobs, give them 90 day goals that role up into an annual goal that feed into your long term vision. Individual employees have numbers they need to monitor/hit and processes are spelled out, trained, and clear. \n\nYou definitely need someone who’s detail oriented to help set you on the right path and take over some of this work. EOS uses the terms “integrator/visionary” for this operations/entrepreneur relationship, which has helped me understand why I suck so bad at some parts of my business, but am really good at others. \n\nThe ops person (integrator) has a fundamentally different DNA/approach to their work than you will and things move slower. This is important, because it allows you AND the organization to scale. You can let go of the operations piece and focus on the company building “entrepreneur” stuff you’re good at.\n\nThere’s a lot more to the philosophy, but I recommend reading the book if any of the above sounds helpful.",

Spent 2.5 years building it, lost $40K, peak revenue was $98/month. The painful part wasn't just losing the money, it was realizing I'd wasted 2 years on something nobody wanted because I was too scared to actually ask people if they'd pay for it before building. Second startup I forced myself to talk to 30+ people before writing any code, asked if they'd actually pay for it, got commitments, then built the simplest possible version. Sold that one for $180K. The lesson isn't \"customer discovery is magic\" because it's not, I still made tons of mistakes. But talking to people first makes you suck like 30% less which is the difference between total failure and modest success. Now I won't build anything without validated demand first, even though it feels slow and uncomfortable.",

Running a business can be brilliant, but it’s not freedom by default especially at the start. You usually swap one boss for many, income is inconsistent, the stress follows you home, and when something breaks it’s on you. There are long stretches where you’re working harder than you ever would in a job and wondering why you didn’t just take a stable salary.\n\nThat said, if you genuinely enjoy problem-solving, responsibility, and building something over time, it can be deeply satisfying in a way employment often isn’t. The real win isn’t “easy money” or flashy success, it’s autonomy, learning at speed, and eventually designing a life that suits you but that only comes after years of uncertainty and mistakes. Starting a podcast to learn and talk to owners is actually a smart, low-risk way to see the reality up close. If you go in with eyes open and accept that it’s hard, boring, stressful *and* rewarding, you’re much more likely to do well than someone chasing the Instagram version of entrepreneurship.",

      "selftext": "Six months ago, I wanted to quit sales entirely.\n\nI'd spend 45 - 55 minutes walking someone through my automation service. They'd nod along, say \"this is exactly what we need,\" then hit me with: \"our budget is $500, can you work with that?\"\n\nI was screening people after spending an hour with them. It was backwards and it was killing me.\n\nI tracked it for two weeks: 18% close rate. 12+ hours weekly on calls with people who had no budget, no authority, or weren't even experiencing the problem I solve.\n\nI'm a builder, not a salesperson, so I did what made sense: I built a system that qualifies leads before they ever hit my calendar.\n\n# The System I Built\n\nI created a qualification agent that works in three stages:\n\n**Pre Call Agent**: When someone tries to book a call, a chatbot intercepts them before they see my calendar. It asks 3 questions conversationally:\n\n* \"What's making you look for automation right now?\"\n* \"What's your timeline for getting this solved?\"\n* \"What budget range are you working with for this?\" \n\nOnly people who pass all three get calendar access.\n\n**Enrichment Layer**: While they're answering, the system researches their company. Pulls revenue estimates, tech stack, team size, recent LinkedIn activity. Generates a one page brief that hits my inbox 60 seconds before the call.\n\n**Smart Routing**: Pain score 8+ and budget confirmed = priority calendar slots. Medium fit = educational email sequence first. Poor fit = redirected to free resources with no hard feelings.\n\n# What Actually Happened\n\n**Month 1 - 2**: The system was too aggressive. It blocked 80% of inbound. I was so paranoid about bad leads that I killed good ones too. One prospect who was actually qualified complained it felt like \"applying for a loan.\"\n\nI softened the language. Changed \"What's your budget?\" to \"What budget range are you working with for this?\" Response rate jumped from 32% to 68% just from making it conversational instead of interrogational.\n\n**Month 3 - 4**: My calendar dropped from 23 calls/month to 14 calls/month. I panicked at first.\n\nThen I looked at close rate: 36%, up from 17%. I was talking to people who actually had the problem and could afford the solution. The math was obvious: fewer calls, more revenue, zero ghosting.\n\nConversion from inquiry to booked call went to 63%. The key was asking one question at a time with personality, not bombarding people with a qualification form.\n\n**Month 5 - 6**: The enrichment layer changed everything. I started walking into calls knowing their tech stack and could say \"I see you're using HubSpot and Calendly - here's exactly where the automation plugs in.\" One prospect said \"you've done your homework\" - I hadn't, the AI had done it in 90 seconds.\n\nClose rate hit 44%. I was closing more deals in half the time because I wasn't wasting energy on unqualified prospects or doing basic research manually.\n\n# The Mistakes I Made\n\n**Over filtering early**: Set my budget minimum at $4k - $5K. Missed several $3K deals that would've been great clients and great case studies. Learned that someone saying \"$3K range\" isn't disqualified - they might not understand real pricing yet. Now I qualify on problem severity first, budget second.\n\n**Asked budget question first**: Scared people away immediately. Moved it to the third question after pain and timeline. Response completion rate went from 34% to 63% just from reordering.\n\n**No escape hatch**: Some prospects just wanted to talk to a human without answering questions. I lost 5 - 6 deals before I added a \"skip to calendar\" option. Sometimes friction kills deals, even with qualified buyers.\n\n# The Data After 6 Months\n\n* 284 booking attempts captured\n* 192 completed qualification\n* 73 passed qualification threshold\n* 52 calls actually booked\n* 27 closed clients\n\n# Why I'm Sharing This\n\n# This system works for any high ticket service business doing consultative sales. The problem is universal: you're spending hours with wrong fit prospects instead of closing real deals.\n\n# Quick question:\n\nAre you currently qualifying leads before they hit your calendar, or are you still doing it live on the call?",

The qualification automation is exactly the kind of builder mentality that separates real entrepreneurs from people who just stay busy.\n\nI had a similar 'aha' moment when I realized I was spending tons of time on repetitive follow-ups, lead research, and CRM updates. Built Kairos (my AI assistant) to handle the entire post-qualification workflow:\n- Researches prospects before calls\n- Sends personalized follow-up emails\n- Updates CRM with call notes\n- Schedules next steps automatically  \n- Handles the entire nurture sequence for non-ready prospects\n\nNow I only spend time on qualified calls and strategic decisions. The time savings compound because Kairos works 24/7 - prospects get immediate responses even when I'm sleeping.\n\nCurious - what's next on your automation roadmap? The sales qualification was probably the biggest time sink, but I bet there are other processes that could benefit from the same approach.",

Then the mods removed it. Screenshots attached.\n\nThis is what happened.\n\nA client paid me $5,500 USD for completed AI development work. Stripe refuses to release it. Their justification: a completely unrelated $50 dispute from a random person. That dispute is already resolved. The person got their refund weeks ago. Case closed.\n\nDespite that, Stripe is using this resolved $50 dispute to hold nearly $8,000 that has nothing to do with it.\n\nKey facts:\n\n• I passed all verification requirements. Identity, documents, compliance checks. Dashboard showed all tasks completed.\n\n• Stripe froze my account the day before the payout was scheduled. Not during any investigation. They waited until the last moment.\n\n• Stripe claimed they would refund money to customers within five days. My client confirmed they received nothing. Stripe kept the funds.\n\n• My client provided a signed statement confirming the payment was legitimate, the work was delivered, and no dispute will ever be filed. Stripe ignored it.\n\n• All communication from Stripe is a copy-paste response: “high risk.” No explanation, no evidence, no path to resolution.\n\nThe numbers:\n\nDisputed amount: $50\nAmount Stripe is keeping: $7,946\nRatio: 160 times the disputed amount\nThe dispute is from a different customer and is already resolved.\n\nWhat I’ve done:\n\n• Complaint filed with Stripe. Their final answer: “We’re keeping your money.”\n• Complaint filed with AFCA (Australian Financial Complaints Authority). Case number: 12-25-334332\n• Final Notice filed in SA Magistrates Court. Case number: FNL-25-010285\n• Report filed with ACCC for unconscionable conduct. Reference: accc-report:0098524\n• Posted on r/stripe. Removed after going semi-viral. Screenshots attached.\n\nI followed every rule. Verified identity. Provided documentation. Delivered the work. My client is happy. Stripe decided to keep the money anyway.\n\nIf Stripe can withhold funds arbitrarily, ignore evidence, and silence criticism, every small business is at risk.\n\nSharing this so others understand the danger before relying on Stripe.",

From a different client??That’s not risk assessment.That’s straight-up hostage tactics. Also the timing is exactly how they operate:They let the payment sit long enough to clear, then freeze it the day before payout so you can’t move it. Every freelancer, agency owner, dev, and small business should be seeing posts like this. This is why so many people are moving to:\n\nPaddle\nLemonSqueezy\nPayPal Business (ironically better lately)\nWise Business\nEven crypto invoicing\n\nBecause Stripe has gotten way too comfortable playing judge, jury, and bank. The fact you escalated to AFCA, ACCC, AND Magistrates Court tells everyone reading this that you’re not some shady “high-risk” actor — you’re a normal business owner who got screwed.\n\nPlease keep updating this thread.\nPeople need to see how far Stripe will go to avoid accountability.\n\nAnd good on you for not rolling over!!!\nMost people just give up and let Stripe keep the money.",

They have a nice storefront, good instagram presence, the whole thing. Meanwhile im mostly online with a small booth at farmers markets.\n\nAnyway I got a wholesale order inquiry from a business email I didnt recognize. When I looked into it turns out its literally the owner of that other shop. She wants to buy 50 units monthly because apparently her customers keep asking for scents similar to what I make and she cant replicate them.\n\nI had no idea what to do at first, like is this weird? But then I thought about it and honestly the extra income would be great especially since I've got like $5k from Stаke for better equipment. The margins on wholesale arent amazing but its consistent money and I can probably negotiate better terms since she clearly needs my product.\n\nWe met for coffee and shes actually super cool. Turns out she specializes more in the decorative/aesthetic side and Im better at the actual scent blending. She even suggested we could do some kind of collaboration for holiday markets.",

Formalize everything in writing.\nSet terms like:\n\t•\tMinimum monthly order (e.g. 50 units)\n\t•\tPayment upfront or at least 50% deposit\n\t•\tLead times (2–4 weeks)\n\t•\tTiered pricing based on volume\n\nThat turns this from “casual help” into predictable income.\n\n2. If she wants specific scents, charge development fees.\nShe’s basically admitting she can’t replicate your formulas.\nThat’s intellectual property.\n\nA small formulation fee shows you’re not just selling candles, you’re creating unique blends.\n\n3. Only offer exclusivity if volume stays consistent.\nExample:\n“She gets exclusive access to Scent A only if she orders 50+ units every month.”\n\nIf she dips below that: exclusivity ends.\n\n4. Keep your brand identity separate.\nIf she wants private-label (your candles under her branding), raise prices.\nWhite-label should not be priced like standard wholesale.\n\n5. Use the partnership for leverage.\nYou now get to legitimately say:\n\n“Our products are carried by select retailers.”\n\nThat elevates your positioning and builds long-term credibility.\n\n6. Collaboration only if it expands your reach.\nHoliday boxes, joint booths, etc. are smart ONLY if it brings you more exposure, not just labor.\n\nBottom line:\nShe revealed that she literally cannot replace you.\nSo don’t just sell product, set terms that turn this into a reliable revenue stream and position you as the expert, not a supplier doing favors.",

Wholesale margins aren’t huge, but the steady volume helps stabilize cash flow and lets you invest in equipment faster. Since you’re both strong in different parts of the business, the partnership makes sense as long as you set clear boundaries, pricing, and branding rules. It’s one of those situations where two small shops can grow faster together instead of fighting over the same customers.",

The pricing, policies, and consent forms were clearly disclosed and signed. During the appointment, I checked in multiple times, and the client specifically requested a very minimal result. I initially did more and removed strokes at her request. She also has a complimentary touch-up included if she wants additional fullness.\n\nPayment was made using her mother’s credit card (the service was a gift).\n\nAfter the appointment, the client herself did not contact me. Instead, her mother texted me angrily saying the price was “ridiculous,” called my business a scam, and said she was filing a chargeback. I submitted a full evidence packet (signed consent forms, before/after photos, appointment details, policies, etc.), and it appears the bank ruled in my favor.\n\nNow, after the bank decision, the mother has escalated. She has contacted me again - from a different phone number - demanding a refund within 48 hours and threatening:\n\n- Posting negative reviews and “blasting” my business on Google, Facebook, and Instagram\n- Reporting me to the BBB\n- Reporting me to state licensing boards\n- Using “connections” in the industry to harm my business\n\nShe has framed all of this as contingent on me issuing a refund.\n\nI have not heard from the actual client at all, and I have remained professional and brief, redirecting communication to the client herself.\n\nAt this point, this feels less like a service dispute and more like harassment or extortion. I have saved all messages and have not refunded.\n\nMy questions:\n1. Should I reach out to the client via phone call to understand the situation?\n2. Should I reply to the mother?\n3. What should my next steps be?\n4. Has anyone dealt with something similar after winning a chargeback?\n\nI’m trying to handle this correctly and not make things worse. Any advice from business owners or legal-minded folks would be appreciated.\nThank you.",

Start processing today. No real checks.\n\n2. Shortly after, they say funds must be held “for security reasons” while you continue operating normally.\n\n3. You are encouraged to keep selling. Your balance grows. Stripe is happy to let it pile up.\n\n4. The moment funds are due for release, surprise. They suddenly need “additional documentation.”\n\n5. You submit everything requested. IDs, business records, invoices, proof of delivery, everything.\n\n6. After that, Stripe decides they “can no longer service your account” due to vague fraud concerns.\n\n7. They freeze the entire balance indefinitely “in case of chargebacks” and keep the money.\n\n8. Stripe claims they will refund customers. In reality, refunds often never happen.\n\n9. To protect your reputation, you are forced to tell customers to file chargebacks themselves.\n\n10. Stripe then points to those chargebacks as proof that they were right all along.\n\nFull circle. Self-fulfilling justification.\n\nThe reality is this. The account was fine. The transactions were real. The only thing Stripe did consistently was hold customer money while earning interest and shifting all risk onto the merchant.\n\nIf Stripe truly believed the activity was fraudulent, refunds would be issued immediately. Instead, funds sit. Customers wait. Businesses get destroyed.\n\nMore and more investigators are starting to recognize this pattern for what it is. This isn’t “risk management.” It’s systematic fund retention disguised as compliance.\n\nThis will come back around. And when it does, Stripe won’t be able to hide behind boilerplate emails and trust-and-safety buzzwords anymore.\n\nIf you’ve experienced this, speak up. Silence is exactly what lets this continue.",

          "body": "This pattern is real, but I think it’s less a secret “fraud playbook” and more a structural failure that hits small operators disproportionately.\n\nStripe isn’t actually deciding whether you’re honest or not. Their risk systems are deciding whether your business is *legible under stress*. When something trips a flag, the question isn’t “were these transactions real?” It’s “can this merchant produce a clean, auditable narrative fast enough that our internal confidence threshold clears?” Most can’t — not because they’re doing anything wrong, but because their ops live across inboxes, spreadsheets, Stripe metadata, and half-documented workflows.\n\nAt that point, the default outcome is account offboarding. Holding funds isn’t malicious so much as the path of least internal risk. It looks predatory from the outside because the merchant has zero leverage and no way to reduce uncertainty once the decision process starts.\n\nThis also isn’t unique to Stripe. PayPal, Square, Shopify Payments all behave similarly once volume or velocity crosses a line. The common failure mode is the same: founders are running real businesses, but their operational proof is fragmented.\n\nThis is one of the reasons we’re building Quorum (still in beta): not as a payments alternative and definitely not a magic fix for Stripe, but as infrastructure so businesses aren’t scrambling when a platform suddenly asks them to “prove legitimacy.” Centralized customers, jobs, invoices, inventory, fulfillment — basically making your operation readable instead of reconstructing it under pressure.\n\nIt doesn’t solve the power imbalance, but it can shrink the blast radius.  \nFor anyone curious: [https://usequorum.app](https://usequorum.app)",

First I would ask your vendor connections for insight on your venue.  If you dont have vendor friends (luxury planners and photographers)  that's your problem ! The wedding industry is built on customer service relationships. Reach out to the ones you liked working with the most in the last 2 years. They are the ones referring your clients !\n\nSometimes brides will book planners and photographers before they book their venue ! So make sure your venue is on their most - requested list.\nIf you dont have that start here....\n\n-Does your space need updates?  (Lighting, ease of use, parking , electrical , LANDSCAPING - genz brides want lots of places to take pictures. Make sure no area looks old and shitty ..historic is great, outdated and crumbling is not.) \n\n-Is your bridal suite amazing (open space with natural lighting and cozy furniture)  - this is where the future brides can imagine themselves getting ready with their closest friends - this is a big selling point. Consult with beauty vendors in your area!\n\n- is your venue difficult to work with ? (No good rain plan area, limited time to access, bad parking for guests, awkward layout for the wedding  ) \n\n- does it come with good catering?  Do brides have to pay for every small thing or do you include a lot?\n\nIs your venue able to accommodate other groups such as showers, parties , dinners ? Many venues in my area offer \nBrunches and special dinners (holidays ) to bring in off season money.\n\n\nYour seo and marketing might be good in paper but are you looking at your venue as a bride ? Would you drop 30k on your venue ? Maybe go tour your competition and see what they offer. \n\nWedding venues should make absolutely bank. The most successful in my area do 3 weddings per weekend in our busy season - fri/sat /sun,  have amazing catering and charge $30k-45k base . Depending on your area you might get 6 months of busy season and if you have a nice indoor options you could operate in the \"off season \" 12 months a year.",

This is my first comment on something in small business sub. \n\nYour situation is likely a marketing and customer relations issue.\n\nSaying the market has changed or slowed or what ever is a cop-out. Market conditions are always changing and it’s the owner/operators job to predict and plan for every scenario. As an entrepreneur you’re always going to have times where you’re flying a little to close to the sun. \n\nSo in this situation I would ask - who is your target customer and how do you get in front of them? \n\nWell the question is nuanced because who is the real decision maker? The groom? The bride? The planner? The mother of bride? The person who’s paying for it? … every situation is different. \n\nBut there is one thing that is constant… the planner. If you want consistency in your business you need to build airtight relationships with all the planners in the area so that when they do a venue presentation you’re always on the list. \n\nBut how do you do that? Well here is the “fun” part. You have to work the phones and door knock. Small gifts work too once you have a budding relationship. Pick the top 100 planners and make it your mission to get in contact with all of them over the next 30 days. Sometimes it means showing up to their office or phone calls or mailers. And make sure to build a deep personal relationship when you have a planner on-site. Also - All this has to be you - very important - can’t hire this out. \n\nLast thing is the planners are going to ask “what’s in it for me”. As you know most planners take a percentage of vendor sales which is often disclosed in the contract with the client. Figure out appropriate incentives for the planners based on the industry standard.\n\nThis is the hard target market that nobody wants to work. Much harder than buying an ad or writing an SEO page. Well in business that’s where the money is  - the boring hard stuff",

You do look to be next to an apartment complex, which is good. Can you add a soda fountain, look into starting a coffee part of the business, or something else? Is there another niche that fits in with candy that you can add? \n\nAlso, you might want to consult an interior designer. When I’m buying from a locally owned store, I like it cozy and like to have lots of stuff to look at. This gives convenience store vibes and doesn’t really encourage browsing so much as driving in to buy one thing you want that you can’t get elsewhere. \n\nYour concept may need some tweaking if you want this to be sustainable. \n\nLastly, free samples are a great way to boost sales. If someone tries something they find out they like and then they buy it for many years to come, that’s bank for you. Can you open a new candy every day, cut it into bite-size pieces, and (don’t forget to list allergens) give those out? Make it a thing on social media with a calendar so that people know what day you’re opening what bars so if they want to try something specific, it draws them in.",

      "selftext": "Ive owned a small hair salon for the last 12 years in NYC. When I say small, I mean we do everything “office” related from home since there’s no office in the salon. \n\nWe have several reports that we reference that have taken years to populate with sales data. Over 50 documents in Excel and Word that represent hundreds of hours of data entry and analysis. I use these reports to make my cash projection, coach my staff, make purchasing decisions: the list is endless.\n\nStarting in 2024, we used office 365 exclusively for these reports since my front desk manager and I do this work from our home computers and it was the most simple and reliable for up to date access. I mistakenly assumed that because the documents were in the cloud, this was the equivalent of having a backup.\n\nThis August, Microsoft had a problem processing my credit card on file for the annual fee (it had expired) and instead of notifying any of us on the app when we used the documents,  they sent two emails in November that looked like spam notifying me that the account was about to be cancelled. I opened the email, figured out the problem, and updated the payment info. Microsoft charged me on November 16.\n\nThe next day, November 17th, all of our documents were gone. All of them. \nI’ve spent the last 3 weeks on a series of calls with offshore support people that hang up on me when I ask to speak with a supervisor. The first week they charged me again, opened a ticket, and then called me several mornings at 7 AM to tell me they were working on it.\n\nMore phone calls, more hangups. Yesterday I found another phone number for tech support, and got someone on the phone that explained to me that all of those people had been trying to tell me that my documents were gone. \n\nObviously I should have been backing them up separately but I mistakenly thought by using the cloud system, I was.  Recreating these will take my front desk manager and I hours. This was another painful lesson in small business ownership that I had to learn by f**king up. \n\nTL:DR:\nI used Microsoft Office 365 for cloud storage and they lost over 50 Excel and Word documents that took is years to create.\n\nEdited to add: Thanks everyone for telling me I should have backed up the cloud, I agree. It's helpful to hear how everyone has their backups established. Moving forward I'll have something better set up. To me, the most painful part of being the owner of a small business is having to be an expert in everything, and when you fall short it's potentially catastrophic.",

      "selftext": "Hello, I’m new here. My name’s Gary. I’m in my late 50s and, to put it bluntly, **I feel ‘stuck’ inside my own business**. At the risk of sounding defeatist, I feel like I’m in a fun-free loop, grinding slowly towards failure.\n\nFor over a decade I’ve run my own small video production company. I stumbled into it after being made redundant following the Financial Crisis. At first it felt exciting and full of possibility: travel, interesting projects, big hopes for creative freedom and financial stability. But over time, the reality has drifted a long way from the dream.\n\nThe industry changed faster than I could adapt, with bigger agencies moving into *my* small pond, more companies built in-house content teams, and now artifical blah blah blah intelligence has reached the point where large parts of our work can be done with a laptop and a few prompts, for peanuts. I’m working harder and harder for less reward, with shrinking creative freedom and a lower and lower ceiling on what the business could realistically become. It’s know it’s not going to be enough to give me the future I was hoping for. \n\nSomewhere along the way, this stopped feeling like something I chose and now feels like something I’m chained to. The only future I can see at the moment is bleak: a worn-out version of me, grinding away into my 60s and beyond, unable to retire properly and too tired to keep going. Ten years of sunk effort makes walking away feel like failure — but struggling on feels just as hopeless, to be honest. \n\nIs this a midlife crisis? I’m not sure. But, I worry about trying to find salaried work at my age. I spent ten years in recruitment advertising as an art director, so I can speak with authority when I say that going back into full-time employment and earning what I need in my late 50s is unrealistic. Objectively speaking, the fear is real.\n\nMaybe this is the 21st century reality for a lot of people at my age, who feel boxed in by the lives they’ve tried to build. Anyway, it’s how I feel right now, so I’m asking — genuinely:\n\n**Is anyone else going through something like this?**\n\n**Do you feel stuck in your career or business?**\n\n**How are you thinking about your future?**\n\n**Have you found any direction — or do you feel as stuck as I do, whether you’re in a salaried job or running your own thing?**  \n  \nThanks for taking the time to read.  \nAny shared thoughts will be truly appreciated.",

I'm the last man standing at my small family business in the sense that everyone that was with me when we started my stone engraving company has either died or left.  I've got a great guy over on the production end, and my mom essentially volunteers for us full time and my wife gets a steady paycheck handling our customers.  I haven't gotten paid more than I need to survive at any point in the last 20 years.  I do our stone purchasing, handle payroll, do all of our designs, all of our deliveries, and I cut our sandblast stencils.  I LOVE what we do.  Our customers love us and we put everything we've got into our product.  \n\nWe just have so much baggage.  My brother was in charge for years and he was more interested in going out drinking on the company debit card than he was in running the business.  He drank us into some deep debts with bad business decisions and consistently running up a hundred dollar tab every night if not more, plus multiple trips to Jack In The Box to sop up the booze.  If he showed up by 11:30am I'd almost count that as being on time, and then usually he was off to the 'office store' by 2pm, which was code for going to the bar.  He stopped paying some of our suppliers, our landlord and our tax debts and verbally abused me into a shell of myself over the years.  In January 2020 he didn't show up to work and I had to break into his apartment to find him dead and naked on the floor of his bedroom.  It broke me.  I've been dealing with a lot of PTSD and anxiety issues since then.  I disappeared into my own hole of drugs and alcohol for a few years before snapping out of it.\n\nIt took me too long to realize I was in charge and could change things, but the business has been better since he passed.  I've recommitted myself to growing as a graphic designer and the quality of our finished product is so much higher now that I'm not drifting through life in a haze of weed and anxiety.  We're in a spot where we're growing and making smart business decisions, but I still don't have the cash flow I need to replace our nearly 20 year old equipment or hire on a salesman.  It always feels like we take two steps forward and then the forklift breaks down... we make real good progress redesigning the website and then the electrical box that powers our compressor pops and we've got bills I can't cover.  We always find our way through, but I know that my retirement plan is waiting for my parents to pass away, which isn't fun at all.  Sorry for the trauma dump!  I don't have too many people in the real world I can talk to about it.",

Riding that excitement and trusting my network, I started doing my own job in interior design, graphic design etc. In the beginning, it was fine, but over time I got stuck in a repetitive cycle. I kept telling myself, “This time i will reach my goal, next month, next year I’ll succeed,” and 7 years have passed. Now a truth that I didn’t want to see, has surfaced.\n\nI hesitate to look for a “normal” job because I feel like people will say, “You’ve been away from your field for so long,” so I don’t even apply. I’ve done a lot independently, and I know that compared to an office employee, I can manage projects and handle all the tough processes much faster and better, because running your own business isn’t just technical work, it’s managing the whole process.\n\nBut I feel like independent work isn’t seen as “real work,” and it’s hard to provide proof of your achievements. Continuing my own business means always looking for new clients, earning money from whatever you find, working for free for days. I no longer have goals of making money in this field, nor the excitement to create amazing work.\n\nSeeing my network on LinkedIn with their fancy titles and constant promotions depresses me. We’re in the same industry, but in my own business, they're doing only a small part of my business and that makes them managers.\n\nSo I think this feeling is not about age, but about a reality check. And I feel like breaking this cycle might mean joining a structured system, getting a job. I hope.",

          "body": "I understand the feeling of being trapped. \n\nMid-60's here and it's been very difficult the last couple of years. We're a smaller specialist agency that has very large and mid-sized enterprises for clients. Almost all of the web development we used to do is done offshore (we decided not to become an offshore agency years ago). We pivoted to high-value services that aren't easily done offshore, which helps; but the volume for an engagement is more typically in the low tens of thousands of $ instead of the hundreds of thousands. We lost our whale client a year ago and it's been a deep hole.\n\nI've explored partnering/being acquired by other companies in my business, but it's a hard sell because our business is down. So I feel forced to make this business work. I've been through the downs and ups over the last 30+ years, so it's not unrealistic to make this happen--I've done it a couple times before--but I'm getting tired of having to retrench and start over. I feel my age in that respect. And like you, I doubt that I could find a job that pays what I need--and who's hiring someone my age? So I have to make this business work better once again.\n\nWhat I take away from my experience is that I should have sold years ago when we were on an upward path. I didn't because the good times were rolling and I had built my little one-person operation into a high 7-figure, profitable company that had 60+ employees and a million dollars in cash on hand. That would have been a great time to sell. Instead I invested in a product development that I really believed in but that didn't pan out, and kept the company going when things went down. \n\nIf I had made some different decisions, I would be retired now, comfortably. As it is, I can't retire any time in the foreseeable future. Ironically, I've had a number of employees who made it all the way to retirement working in my company--I'm somewhat proud of that, almost like launching my kids in a way. But I don't share in it at this point. \n\nI don't know what the answer is, and in my business a big win can change things considerably. But I can't count on that and my runway seems shorter, and I should have become more risk-adverse with respect to putting money away rather than investing in the business--which I saw as investing in myself. That was a mistake. Those are two separate tracks. I'm in the process of figuring it out and, unlike running my business, this all seems new and not comfortable. \n\nI don't know if any of this is helpful, except maybe to say you're not alone.",

All 3 of my original partners have moved on to other things, but as a director/editor I’ve always been the most in demand. I would not be able to make nearly as much money in-house somewhere. So I press on wearing lots of hats and with a stable of freelance collaborators.\n\nAI is a tool. It is going to be used to save time and money (already cutting out transcription/translation turnarounds and scanning through footage in seconds) but the need for content is going nowhere. Brands that take themselves seriously will continue to spend money on advertising content. Someone will need to be behind the curtain using all of the tools available to create.\n\nAnd brands want to work with someone they can trust to manage a project from start to finish with all the bumps along the way as well as execute. Hard to come by in my experience. I’ve also seen companies “save money” this year by working only “in-house” and then just white labeling with us. This has meant less competitive bidding, and has worked out well.\n\nBeing a creative who keeps the books, runs payroll, handles insurance, manages the office/equipment/crew with a smile is unique. It sounds like you being a lot to the table. Find the opportunities at each brand/agency/org where you can add value. I even did payroll-only for $500k in work for a friend that’s in-house at a big brand because their AP is such a mess that they were losing vendors.\n\nWhen things were dead at the beginning of the year due to tariff fears, I called all of my contacts and asked them what their needs were. Since June it’s become our second best year ever. Plenty of factors out of our control, but if you were full time you’d have to be worried about layoffs, so try to use your strengths and experience to fill clients needs whatever they may be. Easier said, but I’ve been on the rollercoaster for a long time now and I’m still optimistic about the future of our industry. Good luck!",

No one but a lawyer is going to be able to give you legal advice and stand behind it (you can sue a lawyer for malpractice if something is wrong, and they have insurance). Everyone else is a waste of money (looking at CPAs, other than tax advice). Lawyers you can ask questions and understand why things are done the way they are done. No one else is qualified to answer you without a disclaimer (which means they are not responsible for what they tell you).\n\n$1800 is a bit high, I was charging $1000. It doesn't matter if it is a single or a multiple, the benefit of a LLC doesn't depend on how many members, but how it is being operated. If you can read 2 different copies of LLC OA and can meaningly understand the differences, you don't need a lawyer. If you can tell me why you need to have a meeting with yourself and keep minutes, you don't need a lawyer.\n\nThe above is not legal advice. Consult your own lawyer.",

My state (PA) has a business hub website that will actually create a checklist for you, listing out what you need to apply for and in which order, according to the type of business you’re opening. They ask a few simple questions and then walk you through it. I imagine most states will have a similar thing. \n\nSecond most affordable is legalzoom and maybe will give you extra peace of mind/ease, so although they will upcharge you, it’s way less than a lawyer. \n\nLastly $1800 is actually a pretty affordable quote if you do want to go that route. I recommend this if your business is complicated or maybe if you have a business partner, but it’s not really necessary for most.",

I work in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction design space and it is often a new world for most clients who need a building built or remodeled. However, a recent prospect seems to be asking ChatGPT (or others) what they should ask me and sending me repeated wall of text emails, seemingly directly copied. I am finding it overwhelming to respond when many of the questions are non-sensical and inter-related. I send a measured answer and get one or two more in reply. I am not under contract yet and the project fits my wheelhouse, but the communication load is heavy to wade through these emails and respond professionally. I figure this will become more common and show up eventually with other clients. Is anyone else experiencing this or have thoughts on ways to deal with it? Thank you",

          "body": "I literally work in corporate gifting for a living. Typically larger companies, bigger budgets either by way of quantity or quality.  This is my two cents.. \n1. If you do a logo, make it small and subtle. A little icon or something less obvious is a good way to brand something without taking away usability. Using a mug as an example, a basic ceramic one with a loud logo will be the first i declutter. A nice quality one with a subtle logo would be more appreciated. \n2. If you’re not doing your own decoration, don’t pay extra to get it done. You care more about the logo than anyone receiving it. \n3. If it’s low budget, don’t buy junk… just get a giftcard. We can design beautiful gift boxes but $20 doesn’t go far without looking cheap. With a $20 amazon gift card, i can put it towards that thing I wanted, A pair of socks looks cheap. If you really want to do swag, then give something small, knowing it may be trashed, but give something else with it, like a giftcard. \n4. Echoing 3, but don’t buy the cheap version of something. A $10 cooler is still a $10 cooler… probably not very good. \n5. Real examples of interesting swag I’ve seen (not just more expensive everything): leather goods like nice coasters, key fobs, and Dopp kits. Tech organizers. Hand thrown mug with small stamped logo. Custom keyboards. Olive wood cooking utensils. Hot pads/ oven mitts. Glass togo container. Wireless charger. Mixed reactions on journals.. small accessory to go with a themed gift- ex- coffee scoop with nice coffee, chopsticks with a ramen gift, popcorn bowl with movie theme, candle snuffer with spa theme. \n\nSmall tip for anyone ordering swag. ALWAYS order more than you need, especially when on a clock. Almost every company will send a few with misprints. Obviously returns depend on the vendor, but there’s always an error",

But then those leads bounce when they hit the site.\n\nThe ad will be specific to their offering with a great hook that gets people interested. \n\nBut then they'll send that lead to the main business website. And that website lists 5 services that don't match the offer. Now the lead is lost and they bounce.\n\nI saw this recently with someone running ads for legal coaching. His ad had a click-through rate that you'd think would generate a 4x or so return on ad spend. But he was barely at 2x. Not at all terrible but was definitely missing out.\n\nWith a separate landing page just for the coaching, the same ad started to perform at a 3x. \n\nThe disconnect is expensive. You're paying for clicks on a specific offer, then confusing people when they land.\n\nIf you're advertising coaching, the landing page should only show coaching. If you're advertising meal prep, only show meal prep.\n\nIt should be this simple:\n\n* What is your offer?\n* Does the page you're sending them to deliver ONLY that thing?\n\nIf not, make a simple landing page first. Even a basic one-pager should perform better than a generic homepage. ",

For the past 6 years I have done all of his bookkeeping while he does all the hands on work. Every quarter, it’s always a battle to get all the receipts from him and organized and I absolutely dread it. I work part time already in my own job, but I pick up a lot of shifts too. His business has continued to grow and taxes are getting more and more complicated adding on the house flipping and rental income. I used to have just 1 excelsheet for his LLC and now I have like 4 for all of his different business ventures. It’s December again and I already know this will consume and ruin my month. He is just not good at bookkeeping and I know if he tried to do it himself he would miss major things. I feel resentful to him because I feel like this is falling on my shoulders and I’m done with it. When I try to tell him this, he says it is “our business” and I benefit from the money made in the business. I think it might be time to hire a bookkeeper for my sanity and for the sake of our marriage…. Thoughts anyone? Rant over lol. \n\nEdit: I also manage our Airbnb and do all the cleanings/turnovers myself. I don’t mind doing this, but it is just one more thing on my plate. ",

She kept saying how I referred to the business as “my business” and not “our” business even though she wasn’t involved. I wanted her to be and we figured out she could do the books and handle some calls.  It was a small contracting service business so maybe 5-10 hours a week.  I thought it was perfect and it kept her in the loop and a part of things.   Long story short, things weren’t getting done, slow to get done or not the way I wanted.   Now I had to walk the fine line of not talking to her like an employee.  As we grew, we ran into exactly what you described.   I slowly started doing more of the office work and she noticed. Then I questioned something one day and she said “‘maybe you should just take over everything again.”  I happily agreed.   It may have saved our marriage lol. It’s a hard line to balance on.  I wish she spoke up sooner.  I wish I spoke up sooner.   Neither of us wanted to.   I highly recommend at least approaching him to talk, he may be thinking the same exact thing.  Good luck!",

It's one of the big advantages of owning your own business and if you're not doing it that's a ton of money on the table.

This applies to literally any reasonable expense that could be justified as marketing costs that would not have happened if you didn't own a business. Reasonable means reasonable - client gifts absolutely count, but not if the gift is like... a jet ski or if your client is actually your aunt. Buying things they ask you to buy is even more clear cut - I would even say you're in the right to charge your client for milage and hours doing this. I wouldn't charge clients but definitely should be writing off that milage involved at the IRS milage tax rate.\n\n\nFyi - you don't need to charge to a biz card to do this. All that matters is the receipt. A business card isn't anything special - it a normal credit card in every sense of the word except one that is marketed towards businesses. You can write off stuff on your personal card and you can charge personal items to a business card, the IRS or the banks don't care at all.

Just make sure you add line items to your invoices of Items Purchased for Client (or something to that accord) and tag it out as a separate line item so your end of year taxes will be cleaner because you can tie the COGS to that specific Revenue, quick and clean.

That lack of friction gets misinterpreted as lack of difficulty.\n\nWhat’s often left out is that simplicity at the start usually trades places with complexity later. The hours, risk, uncertainty, and emotional load don’t disappear, they’re just not front-loaded the way a 9–5 is.\n\nThere’s also survivorship bias and platform incentives at play. People who made it through tend to talk about the freedom and autonomy, while the stress, failed attempts, and long unprofitable stretches don’t perform well on social media.\n\nSo I don’t think most people mean “easy” as in low effort. They mean:\n\nno formal barrier to entry\n\nautonomy instead of structure\n\nupside without a salary cap\n\n\nWhether that’s preferable to a 9–5 really depends on someone’s risk tolerance, financial buffer, and what kind of stress they handle better.

It depends what you have and what you want to start. +1 for business\n\nRisk.... ask all of these people that got laid off/ fired within the last few years of how much of a risk working for someone else is. I mean... I can go start a new business every day of the week and make money. You can't go out and get a new job every day of the week. +1 for business\n\nUncertainty.... see what I wrote about risk above\\^. Everyone with a job has uncertainty no matter if they know it or not. The only uncertainty about a business is if THIS business will be around next year... I know I'll still have a business and it will probably be this one but if this one is not making me money, some business will be making me money. +1 for business\n\nStress... I see lots of people with jobs have lots of stress. There is also lots of stress in owning a business. I'll call this one even.\n\nLonger hours... I guess that depends. For 2 1/2 years I worked 120 hours a week (168 hours in a week) at 5 Burger Kings in Omaha. Once I started my service business I only worked 50-70 hours a week. My friend Susan that is a CFO works about 70+ hours a week and has for 25 years. My wife works about 45 hours a week. Neither Susan or my wife HAVE to, but it's in their blood. But neither could run a business, they admit that. Then I have a sister Linda that works 30 hours a week and is broke all the time. Linda also complains about her job and how broke she is. I've always told Linda if she ever wants to start a business I am here for anything she needs including that first $100.... 35 years later she is still broke and complaining. But to be fair, I'll call this one even as well even though business should get the point.\n\nI made enough money in my service business to retire after 20 years at age 50. Not many 'regular' jobs will do that.\n\nBUT... owning a business is not for everyone. Lots of people are meant to work for someone else and complain about it every day, really. Then when those people get laid off/ fired, they worry and spend countless hours looking for a job and making no money until they finally find another job. But that is how we all grew up and were taught, it's not our fault we were all taught that. \n\nIf I was broke and my business closed today... I could start another service business tomorrow and be making money by the end of the week. Mowing, cleaning houses, washing windows, handyman, junk removal.... what ever it takes if I was broke. \n\nOne trick is to make enough money in your business to be able to pay others to do what you don't want/ like to do. I hate paperwork... so I have someone else do it. I always have.",

          "body": "Because “easy” gets conflated with *simple*, and those are very different things.\n\nStarting a business is often conceptually simple: find a customer, solve a problem, charge money. That part *is* more straightforward than navigating corporate ladders, politics, performance reviews, and permission structures. But execution-wise, it’s usually harder than a 9–5 in almost every dimension you listed: hours, stress, risk, and ambiguity.\n\nThe people framing it as “easy” usually fall into one of three buckets:\n\n* **They’re selling something** (courses, coaching, vibes).\n* **They already crossed the hardest phase** and forgot what it felt like.\n* **They’re confusing autonomy with ease.** Owning your time feels lighter, even if you’re working more.\n\nWhat doesn’t get talked about enough is that early-stage business difficulty isn’t the *work* itself, it’s the cognitive load. You’re the CEO, ops manager, bookkeeper, sales, compliance, and customer support simultaneously. A 9–5 externalizes most of that complexity.\n\nIronically, this is also why so many small businesses struggle long-term. Not because the idea is bad, but because operations never get systematized, so the founder stays stuck carrying everything in their head.\n\nThat’s actually the problem we’re trying to address with Quorum (still in beta). Not making business “easy,” but making the operational side less chaotic once things start working—so founders can build systems instead of just enduring stress. It’s not for everyone, and it doesn’t remove risk, but it helps reduce the constant context-switching that burns people out.\n\nThe honest framing should be: starting a business isn’t easier than a 9–5. It’s just a different kind of hard, and some people prefer *that* kind of hard. For those who do, having real operational structure matters a lot more than the motivational slogans people post online.\n\nIf relevant: [https://usequorum.app](https://usequorum.app)",
