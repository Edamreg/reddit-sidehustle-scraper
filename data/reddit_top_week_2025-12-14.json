      "selftext": "bro idk what kinda clients I’m attracting lately but this one dude seriously broke my brain 😭 like he comes in all normal “hey need a simple landing page” and I’m like bet, that’s chill, quick gig, nothing crazy.  \nthen man drops a google doc on me that legit looks like someone wrote it during an earthquake. random CAPS everywhere, half sentences missing, one line literally said “add something emotional here idk but make them feel stuff.” like bro I’m not a therapist I just build pages 😭\n\nand dude COULD NOT stop calling. every 15-20 mins “quick call?” “2 min sync?” “just checking in?” like sir pls let me do the work you are panicking about. I swear I spent more time dodging his calls than actually designing anything.\n\nthen he starts sending voice notes?? whispering. like legit whispering. “make the button… more urgent…” bruh I felt like I was being recruited into some cult. I had my headphones on and nearly threw them off my head like WHY ARE YOU TALKING LIKE THIS 💀\n\nanyway somehow I finish it. clean up his chaos-doc, build the thing, make it look kinda decent. send it. man replies in 6 seconds flat:  \n“hmm not vibing, can you make it more green”  \nand THAT’S IT. no what part. no why. no screenshot. just “green.” like sir what exactly in your life needs to be green? the button? the whole page? the chakra alignment??\n\nI just sat there staring at the screen like ok yea freelancing actually might not be for me today.\n\nhonestly the only takeaway I got from this mess is: if the client’s first message feels slightly unhinged, that’s not a red flag, that’s literally a trailer. the full movie gets way worse. and next time I’m charging a “confusion tax” upfront bc I’m not doing spiritual-color-therapy landing pages for free again 😭",

Anyhow, if anyone wants to know more, it’s pretty specialized stuff and most people don’t make much. But it’s possible. And from what I can tell, there are a lot of people out there making a lot of money in the same sort of niche. I also sell custom stories too, which I can partially make with AI. And though that’s more work, I have made almost $2k this year from 5 of those sales!",

The market is completely flooded. Everyone jumped on this in early 2024 and now you're competing with thousands of people offering the same thing. Same deal with AI-generated art on print-on-demand sites. I tried this for two months and made literally $12. The designs all look the same and the market is buried in AI slop. What's actually worked for me is way less sexy. I started helping local businesses with basic AI stuff — not pitching them on \"AI solutions\" but just helping a dentist's office write better emails or showing a realtor how to speed up their listing descriptions. These people are like two years behind on this stuff and they're happy to pay someone to just figure it out for them. I also make decent money from Notion templates for a specific niche, but that took months to get traction. The uncomfortable part nobody talks about is the timeline. Nothing made real money in month one. It took me until month three or four before I was consistently hitting $300-500. Anyone promising faster results is trying to sell you a course.

What’s actually working today is unsexy, hyper-specific help for people who are behind on AI.\n\nWhat’s been working for me is using AI as a thinking partner with local professionals. Not selling them “AI solutions,” just helping them make better decisions faster. Example: breaking down a dentist’s patient communication flow, rewriting the scripts with AI, and helping staff use it daily. Small wins, but they pay because it saves them real time.\n\nThe pattern I’m seeing:\n\n1. Pick one profession that’s 2–3 years behind the curves.\n2. Sit with them, watch their workflow.\n3. Use AI to remove 20–30 minutes of pain from a task they repeat all week.\n4. Charge monthly for ongoing support, not one-off projects.\n\nIt’s not flashy. It’s slow for the first couple months. But once one person in that niche gets value, they refer you to others.\n\nCurious what niches others are seeing traction in.

Small items, easy to list on marketplaces like ebay and ship em out. But I also see SO many people doing this and prices seem super competitive. I'm worried about getting scammed or dealing with returns when someone says it stopped working.   \n  \nThen I look at furniture, decor, vintage kitchen stuff etc. Seems like way less competition and people will pay surprisingly good money for the right pieces. Just saw someone in my area sell a mid century dresser for like $300. Downside is obviously you can't ship a couch and storage becomes an issue fast. My garage is already pretty full lol  \n  \nDoes anyone have experience with both? Like if you had to pick one lane which would actually be more profitable long term? I've got maybe $300-400 to invest upfront if that matters. Also doing this part time so I can't be spending 8 hours a day sourcing or whatever  \n  \nWould really appreciate any advice from people who've been doing this for a while!!",

For context, I’ve done product reviews for everyone from newspapers to magazines, to all over the internets. Amazon is the only company that sends tax forms for promotional products. There are ways around this that involve incorporating the amount you would have been paid and deducting the items, or including a note that details the lack of payment, or explaining the lack of payment qualifies them as gifts.",

But I want to fill up that time especially in the weekdays after work, ways online or in any way to make some more money (preferably not something like labour as my body is tired after work, work 10 hour days). Willing to invest my money into something/things for this, just don’t know what yet. Am trying to find work for the morning of the weekend aswell (scaffolders I’m in connection with don’t work on weekends usually).\n\nAny tips to make money during the week on the way home from work and at night once I get home? And I don’t want to do surveys or anything like that, not worth my time. Something that I can make decent money, even if I have to invest money i don’t mind. Scared money don’t make no money haha. Aswell any tips on small passive incomes aswell, where I don’t have to spend too much time during the week and make a little bit of money. Things that pay out like surveys but don’t take as much time. \n\nOkay i’ll stop yapping thanks",

Internet, computer, tons of time, but no idea where to actually start or what to commit to.\n\nWhat helped me was not looking for “the best hustle” but first picking something I was genuinely curious about and could do with a computer. For me that was programming. I didn’t know where to start, so I zoomed out and looked at the bigger picture: web development. Then I saw frontend, backend, full stack, read a bit about each, and chose full stack simply because it sounded more interesting to me.\n\nOnce I picked that, I looked up which technologies are actually in demand right now and which ones caught my attention. After that, I used ChatGPT very intentionally. I asked it what languages and tools I should learn for those technologies and then asked it to create an 80/20 list of the specific topics I should study for them, focused only on what’s actually useful.\n\nFor each topic, I’d ask for a clear explanation, a practical example, and a small task to complete. I saved code and useful notes in an organized way so I could come back to them later. That structure alone helped a lot with consistency.\n\nAt the same time, since I want to make money online sooner rather than later, I also started learning smaller, low-barrier skills like creating SRT captions and similar tasks. Same approach: pick one thing I’m actually interested in, build a focused topic list, and work through it step by step instead of jumping around.",

So ... no millions from AdSense.\n\nGot approved for Amazon Affiliate - wrote a few blog posts and gave up because it wasn't converting \"fast enough\" for my liking. Guess what? If I'd done even ONE BF promo or a \"gift ideas for Christmas\" kind of post and *promoted it*, I'd have made enough to make me stick with it. So ... no millions from Amazon Affiliate.\n\nGot approved for Amazon Merch .... same story.\n\nDo you see the pattern here? It's not enough to START. You need to stick with something long enough to give it time to work, rather than giving up after a short while. \n\nPick a thing. Anything. Figure out how to get it online. \n\n***Do some actual promotion.*** &lt;- Without this, no online venture can succeed these days, there's just TOO much noise out there. So you'll need to put money into ads (the quickest way to get people to see what you're selling, and to buy, but you risk spending a lot of money if you don't know what you're doing and don't keep an eagle eye on that ad spend). Or you'll need to spend money figuring out how else to get discovered - either by posting regularly or by partnering with someone who does know what they're doing and can get you sales.\n\nYouTube can help you figure out where you're stumbling in a particular venture. Can help you get past the obstacles. More than any course you can buy, you'll learn by actually DOING the thing and figuring out how to get past the roadblocks. And there are roadblocks in everything we try that is new to us.\n\nGood luck. If you stick with something long enough, I can promise you you'll learn enough to make it work.",

          "body": "I'm not sure what you meant by selling your art, but if it was on Etsy, that's a LONG game. And even then, you're not guaranteed to be seen with all the other million of sellers. The people that do best on Etsy are the ones with a good social media following. \n\nI've been selling on Etsy since 2014 and it's not a big money maker for me. Partly because I can't scale my handmade items even if they did catch on. But I make enough to keep me going, giving me a small profit for a small bit of work.\n\nI don't have a social media presence, but I do okay. It took from 2014 - 2017 of learning Etsy SEO (which is not at all like Google SEO or eBay SEO), finding what works in my niche, oh and the biggie is to **have a niche**. Can you say exactly what your art is and identify a particular person and not generally 'people who have bulletin boards'? \n\nFor instance, I sell push pins, but my niche is Kawaii Cute style, and I only sell push pins.\n\nIf I need money, then selling things around the house on eBay is usually my best option, too. I was lucky my daughter was into collectibles figures, and even though (or because?) she played with them, they sold well. Sometimes I go to charity shops and find Barbie or My Little Pony things and those sell well. Even when selling on eBay, get a niche. Niches sell better than just throwing things up. When I sell on eBay it's usually toys. And because of that I now have an eye for what toys sell.\n\nIf I went around and just bought random things, I'd have more misses (things that don't sell) than hits with fast selling items.\n\nPeople are not making millions with PDFs unless the PDF is in a specific niche that people need.\n\nOn Etsy, there is a person that does make a lot of money with Excel spreadsheets. But she is very good with Excel and is able to do good customer service since she understands Excel and how people will mess up the formulas.  She can also customize the Excel spreadsheets for what Etsy sellers need. \n\nIf you have a strength that someone needs for their business, then that's the way to go. Her shop is successful (in my opinion) due to word of mouth. When I see on Etsy seller forums someone asking for accounting help, they will mention this shop and say they liked her forms. These cost about $100 each, but people buy them because she is good at what she does.\n\nPOD is always tough, even if you have your own artwork. There are so much POD shirts (etc) that it's hard to get seen. At one time (Etsy has been cracking down a little bit on this) people would buy a design on CreativeFabrica and without changing a thing stick it on a POD shirt. At one time if you looked up Be Kind t-shirt you'd see over 1,000 listings of the exact same \"Be Kind\" with Boho rainbow in the same colors, all the listings one after another. This made Etsy search a bit boring, so Etsy did crack down and reminded people that the seller has to change the design significantly enough for it to be unique. \n\nEven so, POD is not the road to riches. One youtuber showed how much he made with POD shirts. With advertising (which he said he needed) he made $1.00 for each shirt. Without Advertising he made something like $3 or so on POD shirts. When he started printing his own shirts in his garage he ended up with about $10 profit from each shirt, but as you can imagine that is a lot of work. \n\nNow he is an Etsy Coach. I don't even think that is the way to riches, but it pays better than POD. It takes a lot to get seen in that area as well. \n\nMy thoughts: you have to be fantastic at marketing (or at least find your audience somewhere like on TikTok or Pinterest) and have an equally fantastic product. But then, sometimes foreign manufacturers (or even Michaels, the craft store) will see it, copy it and mass produce it for pennies on the dollar. I do better at my 9-5 (despite what Etsy coaches say) than I do in my Etsy shop.\n\nMy reliable \"side hustle\" is Fetch Rewards. It's not much, though. I probably average enough points every 3 months for a $50 gift card. The games have the most points, not the receipts. \n\nI consider my Etsy shop more like a part time job. It doesn't bring in much, there are no benefits, but I'm always on call to answer customer questions. Not what I call a side hustle. 😋\n\nGood luck!",

Obviously it fluctuates but on average I'd probably make $100-500 a week and spent maybe 10-60mins total per week (sourcing stuff, posting it and meeting people)\n\n\n\n\nMy process:\n\n\n\nUse [warehousewatcher.com](http://warehousewatcher.com) to find Amazon warehouse deals, alot of that stuff is 40% off + and is in like new condition. If you can't find a buyer you can always return it too.\n\n\nAlso if you go directly on [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) enter \"warehouse deals\" in the search field, this also lets you look through their warehouse items, however they've made it increasingly hard to see what's actually in stock without clicking on the item first.\nAnother excellent way to source product is if you're lucky enough to have online auctions with local pickup near you. You'd be surprised how cheap you can get things simply because you don't have competition.\n\n\n\n Places like maxsold.com list estate sales, auctions etc nearby Also places like canoe.com, keepa.com and camelcamelcamel.com are useful for finding lightning deals to flip as well. Just check camelcamelcamel to see how much it's worth regularly.\n\n\n\n\nRules, always meet in public, preferably somewhere you can get to within 2 mins or less. And never leave until they say they've arrived. This way you don't actually waste any time if people decide to ghost you (which will happen)\n\n\n\n\nIt just occured to me to post this after several friends and family just told me they were tossing out perfectly new stuff because it was \"taking up space\". I told them to list it on marketplace and it literally just never occurred to them that they could do that. Just in case others are in the same habit, thought I'd bring it up.",

Given your situation with English skills and computer access, remote data entry on sites like Clickworker or Appen might work since they don't always need degrees. \n\nAlso try a mix of survey apps and micro task sites to get some cash flowing quickly. Things like Swagbucks for surveys or Babki which has both surveys and mobile games if you need a break from the repetitive stuff. You can usually cash out within a few days once you hit the minimum.\n\nthere are a lot of AI hustles as well, please look into them to see which ones you are applicable for, stuff like AI voiceovers is getting a lot of traction and elevenlabs is good place to start.\n\nFocus on getting approved for 2-3 platforms this week instead of trying everything at once.",

I’m better at doing shorts/reels as opposed to long form yt videos but I want to build up this skill.\n\nUGC: I can make good looking content and I’m happy in front of camera\n\nAppointment setting: I’ve seen a lot of hype about this, but don’t know much about it. \n\nSo, I guess what I’m asking is, which is the most lucrative? Which is the easiest to get clients? Is it feesable to make any of these into my full time gig / make a full time living from these “side” hustles? \n\n",

          "body": "Based on what you already do for work, SMMA makes the most sense to start with since you're literally already doing it. You know the work, you just need to find clients and charge properly for it.\n\nVideo editing for shorts is in high demand right now. Every business wants short form content and most can't edit themselves. Easier to get clients than long form youtube stuff too since the turnaround is faster.\n\nUGC could work but it's getting really saturated and brands are picky. Unless you have a specific niche or look they're after, it might be harder to break into than the other options.\n\nAppointment setting has hype because it's basically sales without the closing part. If you're good at talking to people and following up it pays well but it's also commission based usually so income can be unstable starting out.\n\nMost lucrative long term is probably SMMA if you can scale it. Easiest to get first clients is video editing since you can show a portfolio fast and there's tons of demand.\n\nNone of these are easy full time gigs immediately tho. You'll probably need to do your 9-5 for a while and build the side thing for 6+ months before it can replace your income. The people making full time money from these put in serious hours for months before it paid off.",

I don't know the strategy, I've never done it, but a good friend of mine does it, she's 38, and she pulls in about $2,500 / month on average. She says she can easily double that, but it would require significant amounts more time and creative investment.

Many people change careers, jobs and pivot to different industries entirely in their lifetime. Keep an open mind and consider the right sidehustle could make back anything you put into that license and even more.\n\nThe other advice I’d give is try to focus on ONE thing. I know you are trying different things and that is good to a degree. But juggling too many things can actually make it harder to focus on one thing that could really make the difference.\n\nI can’t tell you whats best for your situation, but whats working for me is trying Affiliate Marketing for high ticket items. I can work from home, theres no shortage of products or people buying things (just ask Amazon) and pay is not capped by hourly wages or salary like traditional jobs.\nI’m happy to discuss more if you want shoot me a message.\nBest of Luck.",

      "selftext": "I'm not someone who brags. But dammit I deserve it right now haha.\n\nI worked a super dead end job while I was still living with my parents a few years ago (20 years old at the time). I didn't have a lot going for me at all but I knew I wanted something bigger. So I started to save up just to do it. It took me a year of saving as much as I possibly could and I turned around and risked it all by opening up a vending machine franchise. I was determined to make it work because of my literal life savings gone in a blink of an eye.\n\nI went with a company that was turnkey and also claimed to help with getting me into locations (smartmarket solutions) but I was only able to purchase two machines at the time because of costs and how much my savings was. Again, risked it for the biscuit lol.\n\nI was able to instantly start making passive income. And then I was very quickly able to surpass how much I was making as a manager in retail. I decided to save it because I was still in the same position I was beforehand and also still lived with my parents. I felt like this was too good to be true and it freaked me out LOL.\n\nAfter a few months of steadily outpacing my income, I decided to turn around those profits and buy 2 more machines. So now up to 4. Last week I was able to quit that job and in the timeframe of November 8th to today, I passed $10k.\n\nComing from someone who was living at home (moved out last weekend!!), working a terrible job making $25k a year, while watching all my friends go off to launch their careers, and really just accepting my fate...I'm here to tell you three magical words: Take the chance.\n\nThis subreddit is a HUGEEEEEEE part of my success and planted a ton of seeds. I can't remember where I heard about franchising out vending machines first (def here or yt) but I know I read like a manic before making the decision. There's so many people here who are in a similar place and just don't take the chance. Take the chance. It could change the course of your life.\n\nSo. There's my brag. It took a lot for me to write this since I'm someone who very much doesn't like to talk about my success or whatever. But this feels different for whatever reason. SO thanks for reading and I hope you take that chance :D\n\n(by the way you better believe I'm reinvesting a large majority. rinse and repeat BABYYYY!!!!)\n\nEdit: I’m a bit overwhelmed. For those that are looking for a message of hope, please view this as that. I don’t care what company you go with or what side hustle you pick. Rooting for you! And thank you for the kindness for those that have given it. Definitely going to be stepping away from screens for a bit after this one. ",

I did a bit of sniffing around and found out that this company was known as HealthyYOU Vending a couple months ago until they changed to Smartmarts.ai\n\nLooking at their BBB profile they had about 3 terrible complains(one star)in 2022 then had some 5-7 5stars that honestly sounded fake. Too optimistic and some didn't give enough details. Then another one star review as the most recent. 3.6 stars overall.\n\nLooking at Reddit posts, Facebook posts and overall just web surfing I've found that they promised you everything but when they finally got you the machines you'd find out that they WOULDN'T help you with finding the location after promising you that they would do so. Also YOU ARE THE ONE REFILLING THE MACHINES. There isn't some guy from the company doing this YOU ARE. Also they would sell you the machine 2x what it was actually valued at and made you pay service fees that when you actually needed servicing done they would Ghost you or keep you calling others in the company.  And the training? I found some post saying that you wouldn't get any training or if they did provide you then you wouldn't be able to contact the instructor a couple months afterwards.\n\nThe same guy Jeff Marsh, is the president and Co-Founder of the companies. I found a Instagram post from ifpginc titled \"Jeffrey Marsh, Founder of Smart Market Solutions (formerly Healthy YOU Vending) join Red for this IFPG Discover. Lot's of innovation, pivoting, and industry evolution happening through them!\" That mentioned this transition in the first few minutes of the 14 min interview. Didn't see it all bc i just wanted to do a small look into this company. Don't have much interest in it but this rabbit hole looked very complex.\n\nThe staff is the same as the old company other than Location Procurement Team Lead being changed. And a new co founder mike Burnett being mentioned.\n\nHonestly i see so many red flags here. If y'all still want to do something like this then all's to you succeeding. GL.",

We all know that.

So the idea was, DO THIS HARD WORK for X amount of time, THEN enjoy the benefits of that work LONG after its made.\n\nBut new people, like OP, started coming into this space, or learned of this term without knowing the history of the term, and began critiquing others using the word properly.",

My biggest investment is labor as one product can take me between 5-20 hours. Another hour to generate the listing and prepare the download links and then I’m done. I have products from 2018 that I haven’t ever touched and they still generate income every day. \n\nNow I have on going expenses - software subscriptions, website subscriptions, and have to manage all that but 99% of my time is dedicated to new products. \n\nI went back and looked to pull some data. For the last 4 months of 2021, I had a medical emergency an was burning out so I took a break. I had 217 items listed for sale and my sales totaled close to $14k, my expenses totaled $400, and I averaged 2 hours weekly. I did have a week where I put in 17 hours but that was for an IT issue and had to touch over a 100 products.",

          "body": "I think you’ve confused the phrase passive income with something more along the lines of passive employment. No, of course there’s no way to earn money without putting in work. There is no such thing as a passive job. Passive income represents money you earn while you sleep. By your logic, not even investing is true passive income because:\n1) the money still needed to be earned one way or another.\n2) someone is still out there actively managing that investment (whether it is you or a broker)\n\nSo, if someone invests upfront time and costs into a vending machine business that needs to be emptied and stocked (say once a month), the entire month that it’s not being actively stocked or emptied it is earning you passive income. I would argue that vending machines are a source of TRUE passive income since they can’t be use while being filled…\n\nThe same maintenance schedule can be applied to buying and selling stocks. Once you invest that first initial time, or any subsequent time if you buy and/or sell, it becomes active, but while it sits there, it is passive.\n\nOnce you make and upload a YouTube video, it can now bring in passive income (in theory; popularity and many other factors play a big role). Once production is done, the video needs little/no maintenance to continue to get views and have earning potential. Sure, you have to put in work to make the videos and set up ads or whatever you need to do, but each video you make and upload creates its own stream of passive income.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone not sure if you remember me but back in June I started an update series on this sub called Selling Weekly \"Lottos\". My goal was to try and show people how selling options using your shares and cash as collateral can be an amazing form of passive income.\n\n\n\n\n\nNever stopped, just moved my posts over to places with a similar community related to selling options for income. Still showing all my choices and results every week.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack when I just started it here I got a few people saying to show the longer term results.\n\n\n\n\n\nWell 6 months was last week. I made almost $40,000 using an average weekly risk of $132,000. Thats a 30% total yield.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this was a normal 40 hour a week job I would have been making $38 per hour for this last 6 months doing this. But I barely spend an hour a week opening and closing the positions.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople really misunderstand this strategy. They think you can lose everything, but out of 26 weeks I only lost 2 weeks and both were normal investing losses, nothing outlandish.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople also think it will underperform the market. Well my results show this outperforms the market. I got double the return of SPY in this time frame.\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly people think its risky, but its risk adjusted returns are the highest. Maybe people automatically assume because it has to do with options contracts so its like wsb.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll i'm doing is making an agreement with a buyer to either sell the shares much higher or buy the shares much lower by next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gambler pays a premium for this chance because they can make a lot of money in a short time if the stock really does go up or down huge.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you really look at the charts stocks mostly stay sideways for a long time then get a sudden burst where they go straight up or down for a short period of time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThats why this outperforms just buying and holding SPY in my opinion. You are getting income every week just because stocks COULD go up or down.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd its not like dividends where the money is subtracted out of your shares. Options premium income is in additional to any unrealized gains.\n\n\n\n\n\nI also get an automatic HYSA for cash being used for cash secured puts. This is a 3.65% icing on the cake called a Money Market Account in brokerages. That interest income isn't included in the results.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I'll keep seeing whats happens. We had perfect market conditions for this strategy this last 6 months, so I want to test this out in a less forgiving market.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, let me know if you have questions and I'll try to ELi5.",

A deep scrape of 765 newsletter issues found 210 unique advertisers over 4 years. The most frequent categories overall were food and dining, media and news, non-profits, retail, and home services.\n\n*But the top ad slot told a different story:* real estate, medical and healthcare, and financial services dominated. These advertisers were local businesses with high lifetime value, like luxury realtors and plastic surgeons, and big corporations with real local footprints.\n\nThe kicker: just five advertisers bought more than half of all top placements in the newsletter’s history.\n\n**The bigger opportunity is simple:** Local ad markets are fragmented and underserved. If you build an audience with engaged local buyers, a handful of “linchpin” advertisers can carry most of your revenue.\n\n⏮️ *Start backwards.* Define your ideal advertisers, then program your content for the exact people those advertisers want to reach. Daily utility beats fluff: openings, closures, events, zoning news, school updates, traffic, weather, and quick profiles of small businesses.\n\n**The Ramen First Step:** Pick one metro under 500k people. Define three linchpin categories you’ll serve. For example - luxury real estate, elective medical, and wealth management. Publish fifteen straight weekday issues to show traction, utilize social media to get subscribers, then open up to advertisers once you cross 10k subscribers.\n\n***👉🏼 Check out*** [***TheRamenHustle.com***](http://theramenhustle.com/) ***for daily scrappy business ideas sent to your inbox.***\n\n",

      "selftext": "I know this may not be something talked about often here but hear me out, I think I might be onto something. So casinos have been doing rakeback forever basically giving players a slice of the house edge back so they keep grinding. Sportsbooks almost never touch that because the margins are way thinner, but I’m trying to see if there’s actually a way to make something similar work on the sports side.  \n  \nSo I’ve been looking into this sweeps sportsbook called Bracco and I noticed something that made me pause. Not saying it’s good or bad I’m genuinely trying to figure out whether this is beatable or if I’m just missing something obvious. They seem to actually publish the house edge for each bet type, and then they give you 50% of that edge back instantly in free bets??  \n  \nExample:  \nA 3 leg parlay is listed as having an 8% house edge.  \nSo if you bet $100, they expect to make $8 then they give you $4 back right away.  \n  \nThat’s where I started running numbers to see if there’s an angle.  \nI’m around 52% long-term on -110 lines (DFS background, years of tracking). On straight bets, that’s still a small negative roughly -$0.72 per $100.  \n  \nBut applying that 52% hit rate to a 3-leg -110 parlay:  \nPayout is +596  \nProbability of hitting all 3 at 52% per leg: 14.05%  \nEV of the parlay itself: -2.13%  \nAdd back their 4% rakeback (half of the 8%): overall EV becomes +1.87%  \n  \nWhich… feels wrong? Like mathematically it says you’re profitable on $100 bets when you shouldn’t be. My gut says they’re banking on people getting greedy and firing 6-, 8-, 10-leggers until the edge swings back their way. But if someone stays disciplined and repeats the same 3-leg structure, I’m honestly not pointing to the flaw yet.  \n  \nSo yeah am I thinking about this correctly? Is there a hidden catch or is this one of those rare situations where the house is overestimating its own edge and we can actually squeeze something out of it? Would love someone smarter to poke holes in this because it feels too good.",

Have you looked into investing in dividend stocks? That’s as passive as things get. I would also recommend looking into selling options (“covered calls” and “cash secured puts”) - they’re super easy and can make you a lot of money fairly passively, but they can require a lot of capital depending on which stocks you want to sell options against.\n\nObviously there’s also buying rental properties, which, again, can require quite a bit of capital to get going unless you do creative financing. \n\nThere’s micro-lending through platforms like Prosper.\n\nThere’s interest that you can collect from high yield savings accounts and US Treasuries. \n\nCrypto staking is another avenue, depending on which state you live in and how comfortably you are with cryptocurrency. \n\nThen on the product side you can make and sell digital products like E-books (or even physical books though Amazon and Barnes and Noble). You can also sell digital products through sites like Shopify or Etsy. You could also create and sell courses…\n\nThere are a lot of different routes you can take, just friends on your skills, knowledge, whether you want to make a product or just buy assets.\n\nI personally collect passive income through stock dividends, selling stock options, staking crypto, collecting interest from high yield savings accounts and T bills and micro-loans, and revenue from YouTube videos, sales of digital products on Shopify and Etsy, and I collect royalties from music streams (Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, etc.) and music publishing (SoundExchange and BMI).\n\nIt can be done, it just depends on what direction(s) you want to take.",

Buy a small content site with existing traffic\n\nBut don’t buy random Flippa junk. Look for:\n\n6–12 months of Google Search Console data\n\n50%+ traffic from informational keywords\n\nMonetized via affiliates or lead gen (not ads alone)\n\n\nAfter buying:\n\nUpdate top 10 posts\n\nAdd better CTAs\n\nRepurpose content to Pinterest + Reddit + Quora This alone can 2–3× revenue without new content.\n\n\n2. Build a “semi-passive” site + paid traffic for validation\n\nInstead of waiting for SEO:\n\nPick one boring but profitable niche (finance tools, SaaS, health accessories, B2B services)\n\nBuild 20 high-intent pages\n\nSpend $500–$1k testing Google or Pinterest traffic\nOnce you find pages that convert → scale or hand off.\n\n\n3. Digital asset &gt; product\n\nBuying a site that sells a single digital product (template, calculator, checklist) is often cleaner than blogs.\n\nNo inventory\n\nHigher margins\n\nEasier to automate with email + retargeting\n\n\n4. What I’d avoid\n\n“Automated” Amazon sites\n\nAI-generated content farms\n\nSites without email lists or search data\n\n\nPassive income today = upfront work + owned traffic → maintenance later.\nAnything truly hands-off is usually either oversold or underperforming",

If the spread is 19 points you want to pay no more than .35 percent that is a guide.  The part you want is for it to be in an uptrend.  Keep in mind right.

      "selftext": "I work in corporate HR which is ironic because I'm the one enforcing our social media policy. Last year I had to write someone up for posting a photo of their desk on Instagram. Just their desk. So I'm definitely not showing my face anywhere.\n\nBeen trying to make productivity content work since August. Time management tips, how to organize your day, that kind of stuff. Figured it couldn't be that hard.\n\nIt was that hard.\n\nStarted with text over stock footage. Coffee cups and notebooks. Nobody watched. Maybe 400 views per video and it took forever to edit each one.\n\nTried filming my hands writing in a planner after a few weeks. One video got 1900 views and I thought I figured it out. Made a bunch more. They got like 500 each. So I didn't figure it out.\n\nKept posting through September and October. Views stayed around 500 to 700. Wasn't great but at least it was consistent.\n\nThen I bought better equipment because everyone said quality matters. Microphone for $95. Got a music subscription and some caption app. Was paying like $40 a month for tools. My videos looked way more professional.\n\nViews got worse. Dropped back down to 400, sometimes 300. I literally spent money to go backwards.\n\nMy roommate kept asking how it was going in this voice like she thought the whole thing was pointless. It probably was. I'd been doing it for months and made zero dollars.\n\nFew weeks ago I just changed everything. Made the videos look like an actual person talking instead of text floating around. Using CapCut for editing, APOB for the face part since I obviously can't use mine, and Riverside for audio. About $30 a month total so at least it's cheaper than before.\n\nViews got better. Not consistent but better. Some videos get 5000 views, some get 1800. I still have no idea why. Posted two videos about morning routines last week. Same style, same length. One got 5800 views and one got 1600. Makes zero sense.\n\nI'm at 1900 followers now. A productivity app reached out last week and paid me $100 for a sponsored video. First money I've made from this.\n\nTold my roommate and she was like oh wow you actually made money. Yeah. $100. After four months. That covers my share of groceries for two weeks.\n\nI still don't know what I'm doing. Some videos work and most don't. The algorithm feels completely random. I'm putting in maybe 5 hours a week and I can't tell if it's going anywhere.\n\nThe $100 is something but it's also basically nothing. I could've done Uber Eats on weekends and made way more without spending hours trying to figure out why one video gets 5800 views and another gets 1600.\n\nBut what if I quit now and next month I actually start making decent money. Or what if I keep going and it stays like this and I just wasted more time.\n\nI'm tired of not knowing if this is worth it or if I should just cut my losses and do something that actually pays consistently.\n\nHow long did it take you to figure out if content was actually worth sticking with?",

Everyone owns 5-20 properties but nobody has any clue which ones perform well, they're all just guessing on rent prices and maintenance budgets, flying blind on which property to sell first if they need cash.\n\nConvinced 3 friends to give me read only access to their property data for a free trial. Sent them weekly reports showing underperforming units, rent optimization opportunities, maintenance spending alerts, market comparisons against similar properties in their area. All 3 offered to pay immediately after first report, didn't even finish the trial period.\n\nBuilt it into a service at $99/month. “How is this a passive income?” I use leni to automate the analysis work and get all the necessary insights fast. No manual hours per cliet, which would've also made this impossible to scale. Now at 47 subscribers which is $4,653/month. Time investment is maybe 4-5 hours weekly reviewing what gets flagged and personalizing the reports with my insights.\n\nGrowth has been 100% word of mouth through investor groups and rei [meetups.Business](http://meetups.Business) model works because investors know they're leaving money on table but don't have time or skills to analyze properly. I'm not doing anything sophisticated, just filling gap between \"I know I should track this\" and tracking it. Like one client found few thosands in missed rent increases just from first analysis, another discovered they should've sold a property 2 years ago based on performance trends.",

Video game ads, Knick-knacky dropshipping items/toys, or anything that appeals to a wide audience will be your best bet.\n\nAs for actually making money, you’re kinda stuck waiting for someone to reach out to you unless you want to start cold messaging existing online businesses asking for sponsorship. Even for 1m+ followers, for a meme page you could expect to earn $15 - $50 per sponsored post until you can prove audience viability.\n\nMy advice would be to find / wait for some general sponsors, find out what does well w your audience, and then shift to promoting affiliate products that you’ll get a % commission on. That’s when you’ll actually start earning, once you find a product you know your audience will like + a business willing to play ball &amp; give you a cut of their actual earnings.",

First month I made like $50 while building reviews but now it's steadier. Takes time though, maybe 2-3 months before it feels worth it. Also Upwork now makes you buy connects to apply to jobs but if your profile is good u might get invited for the jobs so if your buildin a profile there make sure to keep it polished.\n\nRemote part time work like customer service or virtual assistant jobs. \n\nFor smaller amounts faster, survey and reward apps work but they're slow. I make around $80-100 a month from a few apps combined using stuff like Swagbucks, Branded Surveys, and Babki which has both surveys and games. It's not impressive but it covers my Spotify and food between paychecks. Takes maybe 2 weeks to see your first cashout depending on the app.\n\nAs a finance student you could also look into tutoring high school kids through Wyzant or similar sites. Pays better than surveys and you can set your own rates.\n\nThe honest answer is nothing pays quick and easy. The stuff that pays well takes months to build up. The stuff that pays immediately doesn't pay much. Pick based on whether you need money this week or you're okay with a longer ramp up for better pay later.",

      "selftext": "When you’re at day zero or close to it, long-term vision can actually be a trap. Big dreams are motivating, but they’re also vague and vagueness is where procrastination hides. What helps much more at the start is designing a concrete next 30 days. \n\nLooking at early‑stage journeys inside [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org/), you almost never see successful founders say, “We spent three months perfecting the brand and talking about our 5‑year mission.” What you see instead is simple, almost boring focus: talk to X people with Y problem, test Z version of the promise, try these 1–2 channels seriously, then decide what happens next. \n\nA good 30‑day plan for “just start” mode might look like:\n\n* Weeks 1–2: 20–30 real conversations with people you think you serve\n* Week 3: One rough landing page + one clear offer on it\n* Week 4: A small launch into 2–3 relevant communities + follow‑ups with everyone you talked to\n\nNo fancy stack required. No perfect branding. Just structured learning. \n\nThe advantage of using something like FounderToolkit early is that you’re not inventing this structure alone. You can see how others spent their first 30 days, what they got wrong, and what they’d repeat. That takes a lot of pressure off “getting it right” and replaces it with “let’s run a good experiment.” \n\nIf you’re at the beginning, your job isn’t to design the whole journey. It’s to design a high‑quality next month.",

Go to “people also ask” section, collect those with free chrome plugins “ahrefs” or “people also ask” (1 min deep mode or 3 level deep is fine, you’ll get what I mean once u use it)\n3. Go to image tab, collect both entities in the chips horizontal menu uptop, also collect related entities from the images results (there are couple of lists of 5-6 entities popping up between images)\n\nLook at the phrases/keywords/entities you got, select those that describe characteristic or integral part of your main keyword, for example for “water” it will be “temperature” or “boiling temperature”, for “retirement calculator” it will be “formula”, “by age” “chart by age”. See if those aspects of your tool are mentioned on your page. Use only those that are super-closely tight to your main entity, like some characteristics that are integral to your entity, by integral I mean determinative qualities, like for example you can not call your page “dragon” and not mention giant flying lizard spitting fire.\n\nThen go to your competition websites up to place 20, see if there is conventional knowledge about the topic that they mention and you don’t. Warning: if competition is high authority government websites or wikipedia like websites, I would ignore those and look for blog like sites and tools sites like your own.\n\nAfter you enhanced one of the tools pages, you should write supporting articles for this tool. The process of finding a topic and content to write is similar to finding holes in you tool’s page, but this time you are looking for related topics and entities, not tight to “retirement calculator”, you are looking for things like “what’s 401k”, “how to plan retirement for couples”. I do usually pick wider general topics that have a chance to bring traffic on their own, but low traffic keywords will do too, the only reason we need them is to boost the main page with an internal link.\n\nIf you going to try this method, I can describe what to do in details, that’s a general idea.",

Content works.  \nMost SaaS benchmarks show content-led products drive **2–3x more inbound leads** over time. Yet founders avoid it because it’s mentally exhausting.\n\nThe real problem wasn’t writing.  \nIt was **deciding what to write every single day**.\n\nSo instead of forcing daily creativity, I built a simple framework that now gives me weeks of content in one sitting. Sharing it in case it helps someone else.\n\n**1: Pick one real customer pain**  \nNot topics. Not platforms.  \nJust one problem your user actually feels (ex- “I don’t know what to post”).\n\n**2: Expand the idea, not the workload**  \nOne idea can become:  \n– a short post  \n– a long post  \n– a thread  \n– a video hook  \n– a blog angle\n\nSame idea. Multiple outputs.\n\n**3: Change the lens**  \nTeach it, warn about it, share a mistake, give a checklist, or show a before/after.\n\n**4: Respect the platform**  \nSame idea, different shape.  \nEach platform rewards different formats, not different ideas.\n\n**5: Generate in batches**  \nWhen you stop deciding daily, content stops draining you.\n\nThis dropped my content time from hours to **15–20 minutes a day** and made consistency sustainable.\n\nSharing this here in case any other founders are stuck in the same loop.\n\nHappy to answer questions or break this down further if helpful.",

Walking out the door the day I quit was one of the happiest days of my life, but the follow up has been tough.  Moved from central London, which I didn’t like much anyway, to a beautiful low cost city on the continent to start the business.  \n\nLong story short the business didn’t work out, but I did learn a ton and I’m better for the experience.  Bought and renovated a couple apartments which was also fulfilling.  I now moved back to a finance job in probably the most expensive city in the world making half what I used to make.  I think my net worth is probably 1/3 to 1/2 what would be had I kept my old job.  But the new job is actually super interesting, I can make a lot of impact and if we get the right exit I’ll make back what I lost and then some. \n\nNow, do I have regrets?  Yea.  I didn’t like London and I was sick of the job but the fact is it was easy to coast along and collect the paycheck.  It’s amazing how much these high profile IB jobs lets you just ride along on the franchise once you get to a certain level.  Life would have been easy (minus the brutal commute) if I was able to suck up the politics and work drama.  But I was sick of it and sick of London.  \n\nAnyway, hang in there and focus on the business.  It will take 3-4 years before you see meaningful progress.",

Various bench marks along the way and awareness to play improv when the unseen appears.\n\nAll the feelings- negative and positive- exist in every arena. The ones specific to an entrepreneur are more potent since you, partners and your loved ones are the ones bearing it. \n\nIf I could help in anyway, I’d put yourself ahead 5 years from now. If you believe in what you’re doing- take out the money- how much do you really believe? If what you were doing paid nothing, would you still do it? If you would, that’s a sign you’re in the correct path. \n\nThe lifestyle change is only rough if you want it to be- I lived next to poverty for 4-5 years before I hit a break through. The break through only came thanks to consistent, calculated time and busting my ass regardless of external opposition. Support from loved ones, too. \n\nAnyway, you’ll figure it out. You got this, just as you always have.",

Making that money at 30 is rare. \n\nSecond thought is fuck you again. People dream of making 33% of what you were making. Entrepreneurship is hard. Owning your own business is a slog.  Owning is not as easy as a collecting 300k a year, probably work from home, with 30 days PTO job. It’s actually difficult. You’re lucky to have the cushion to support yourself and your business.

That’s the douchiest thing I’ve ever heard. \n\nBe humble. Build your product. Shut the fuck up and get your head in the right place. Ownership and being a founder is not easy.

Not everyone exits for 100M\n\nTake a year or two and work the business. If it fails, it fails. My advice, keep your day job, stay humble and work the business untill it can replace your salary.

For the startup, I did 20-30 per month.\n\nIt's definitely a mental grind and needs a lot of resillience, and a sprinkle of delusional confidence. But that for me is what makes things happen and creates results. \n\nMy advice for you is switch to a singular goal, and make that the only goal, which for me was talking to as many business owners as possible. Then you'll be surprised how effective your time management is. \n\nBest of luck!",

I enjoy working with my hands and physically feel tired rather than being a mind zombie at night.\n\nWhen I was working in finance, the research, the deals were fun but I was lacking satisfaction that you get when you actually accomplish something and see the results. Every so often I would sit in front  of the screens and think to myself what would be if I had my own company..\n\nOne day I was at the office and said fuck it, gave my two weeks, and left. After that went to school to get the licenses it took 9 months. Once the company started operating it was just go go go, spend money to earn money. I can’t say I was expecting it to be easy, but the construction business is kind of bad (for me) and I’m realizing it now.\n\nI am an honest person and pretty fair and ethical. I have my prices and pay subtrades  early and full amounts, don’t hassle with them, I want them to win. All that for its to only bite me in the ass after. Work is badly done, and I have to swallow the problem. \n\nI deal with businesses, and the delays are 30-45 days on paper, but in reality it’s 60-90-120 days. What really sucks is that I’m essentially financing projects out of pocket, to then wait and suck up for stuff that wasn’t part of the deal so I please the clients to not only get my money back, but to get paid.\n\nAnyway the image change and ego is what I think stops me from going all in. Going from fancy offices, travelling, spending thousands at restaurants to now always surviving. I essentially have one foot in this new career and the other still in finance, every so often I think of going back. To this day I haven’t updated my LinkedIn since leaving finance because there’s something I feel embarrassed about. \n\nThe entrepreneurial life is hard, depending of your resources and how you approach it. I had to bootstrap it, and doing much more work in different fields now. The testing part is hard, the client acquisition is hard, managing people especially hard headed construction guys is hard, bitchy and demanding clients. Everything about entrepreneurship is hard, I thought construction was in such demand, yeah maybe it is if you’re building new neighborhoods or government contracts, but you have to get to that point, and that’s the hardest part.\n\nI feel ya!",

Losing the easy answer to “so what do you do” feels like getting knocked back to zero.\n\nthe weird part is that this phase is pretty normal. everyone I know who made the leap went through a stretch where they felt broke, invisible and kind of foolish for walking away from something stable. It doesn’t mean you chose wrong. It just means you’re in that in-between zone where you haven’t built the new life yet, but the old one is already gone.\n\nit gets lighter once the wins stack up a bit and you stop comparing everything to the lifestyle you had before.

          "body": "This is funny and probably more accurate than most are comfortable with.  But it's basically how AI is being...mmm...\"marketed\" top down.\n\nWe have Copilot at work.  It was tried briefly to determine what value it had in various functions.  Basically the result was it was a wash.  With or without, the outcomes were basically the same.  You could use it and get something of value, but there were generally trade-offs elsewhere that just ate up any value earned.\n\nWe've also used ChatGPT and a couple others.  We even used AI during out website refresh.  But realistically all that was really doing for us was bypassing costs of looking for and paying for some stock background photos by generating whatever looked good enough to use.  \n\nWe used ChatGPT for some data conversion work, basically having it do some busy work that would just take a little longer to do in Excel.  The specific task was going to be slightly labor intensive and didn't have a formula based pathway.  Basically, we have a lot of part descriptions, and we wanted to abbreviate words and descriptions across several thousand parts and descriptions.  It's not an easy task for Excel or humans to walk through, but AI could quickly suggest keyword abbreviations, and we could review that set, tweak, and use.  Frankly, over the two years we've toyed with AI in various ways, this has been the only task we've ever had it do that was a legitimate win for AI.  It was the only place I felt AI had legitimate value over anything else.  And that's only because it was \"smart\" enough to take plain text prompts and perform actions, something we don't really have outside of AI.  And these actions were specific enough where they were both simple enough but also difficult enough to do by hand.  Still, it also failed 4 times in a row before actually working properly.  It's first output was it just repeating one word that didn't even exist in the text given several thousand times.  That was its first deliverable, lol.  The next two weren't great either.  The fourth finally output basically what we wanted and could at least use as a baseline.  We still did everything else ourselves.  The value of AI started at that specific task and ended there too.\n\nOur biggest take away has been how exceptionally little AI is actually useful for.  It has such a narrow bandwidth when it's used natively outside of a robust software package.  AI alone is a really niche product.  It \"seems\" broad use on the surface and people try, oh do people try, but its core efficient competency is laser beam focused on very key tasks that are very labor intensive for humans.  For everything else, we just find there's other software and processes that are faster and easier.\n\nI feel AI has power.  But I feel that power is mostly on the backend of really good, robust, and well developed enterprise software.  You still want powerful tools tailored well for the core processes in business and operations but AI isn't built for that.  It can however support that work flow in the background.  I feel this is where AI has missed the market.  People simply want AI alone to just kind of replace and do everything.  It's not for that.  It's best used as an engine under the hood of a machine that's actually correctly built for the processes.  Big, robust software, AI underneath doing some key lifting that it's well suited for.  Do that, and you can get a better program.  It's just that everyone kind of went in reverse, threw away the idea of making enterprise software, fired a pile of people, and now are betting heavy on and relying heavily on AI to just...work...magically...somehow.  You sold the horse and threw the cart off the cliff yourself.  It's all backwards, and I don't know how long it will take before that's realized.\n\nA secondary thing is a major problem that AI will have to overcome in the following years: sentiment.  There's already AI distaste, and the heavy shoving of AI into everything and upon everyone worsens this.  We're running into an issue where AI anything is both disliked and not trusted, and it's mainly due to the above cart before the horse approach.  AI is really good...when implemented correctly.  AI is a great support system, but it's a system that needs a big, robust software package over it to really do great and wield that power efficiently.  And because it was done backwards, used improperly, and so force, we will get a pretty large split of populous that likes or hates AI, and now you have to somehow regain buy in into something that a big swath of the population despises and doesn't trust.  First impressions are important.  As this matures, I do wonder how strong the divide stays and how challenging it will be to attempt to develop and then sell a much better, mature, and competent product where AI implementation is actually really good.  Will it be too late?",

And connect people.\n\nAnd then create a team to help them do whatever they've started a year or two later, because it WILL be too much for one person, but all of it will be valuable, and with a heavy focus on pragmatic solutions, connections and change management on all their products.\n\nAnd this is where I am now.

Spent a good amount of time building out the main features, task boards, time tracking, client portals, all that stuff. Had like 7k saved up from Stаke which I burned through pretty quick on development and some basic ads.\n\nRecently im looking at my stripe dashboard trying to figure out why revenue jumped. Turns out 70% of my paying users barely touch the main product. They're all using this random invoice generator I added as an afterthought because I needed it for myself.\n\nThe invoice thing was super quick to build, really basic, but apparently freelancers are just desperate for something that doesnt look like ass and actually calculates taxes properly. Meanwhile my beautifully designed kanban boards that I spent forever perfecting? Crickets.\n\nNow im sitting here wondering if I should just pivot completely and go all in on invoicing/billing tools or keep pretending my PM features matter. Part of me feels like an idiot for not seeing this sooner but another part is like... at least somethings working?",

      "selftext": "After 5 years of starting and growing a cleaning business, I recently just signed the dotted line to sell it! I have officially exited my first business!\n\nFunny to think I stumbled across a Reddit post about starting a cleaning business and did everything that it said lol. Shout out Rohan and anyone who got started from that thread.\n\nIt only felt right to make this post on Reddit because this is where it all started.\n\nThis post isn’t a “how to start a cleaning business” or anything, just sharing a few things from my journey. If you have questions you can ask away!\n\nWhen I started, it was at the beginning of the “remote cleaning business” model era. It took me time to get the business started because I was in college. Once I cracked marketing, which was right before I graduated back in 2021, things began to roll.\n\nApril 2021 I had my first 10-cleaning month. June I had my first 20-cleaning month and July we went up to 30 cleanings. I was all in on the business since then. It was my full-time job, but it was more like a full-time masterclass on business, MBA and the gulag you go through as an entrepreneur. I’m 26 years old now and since starting the business I’ve grown so much when I sit back and reflect. I’m no guru either! I’m from Detroit, I moved to Atlanta to go to Morehouse College, I started my cleaning business my senior year, and since graduating I’ve spent my life up to this point of writing this running the business. \n\nAt the height of the business, which is when I decided it was time to sell, I had the business operating on a chaotic rope.\n\nI had residential cleaning customers and commercial contracts . At one point we had a number of Airbnb properties we did cleaning for and at another point operated all three at the same time. (Was a freaking zoo!) I had a great office manager named V who was the sweetheart and pitbull for me and the business. I had a great team &amp; rolodex of cleaners who, after all the mayhem, worked with us for multiple years at a time. When it was time to ascend, we eventually got another star named J who was our sales rep alongside me.\n\nThe business was at a point where a majority of the business was operating on a system and I checked on everything from my phone.\n\nThis is the point where I decided to package up and get the business on the market for my own personal reasons.\n\nIt’s so much that I learned from running a cleaning business, but these things are the most important that im about to share. \n\n**Live and die by your cleaners.**\n\nIt took me years to understand why the cleaners are the most important part of the business. When I started I thought you could just hire a cleaner by the snap of a finger and when I did that I almost lost every time. The cleaners are the backbone of the business. They are the make or break point. It’s necessary to appreciate when you come across great cleaners and keep them busy. Understand that when customers hire a cleaning service that’s a very serious buying decision for them. Imagine a customer books you, you send an unqualified cleaner and the customer is unhappy and never books with you again. That’s what happened with me until I started bringing on good talent.\n\nMany will say the most important aspects of the cleaning business are marketing and you need to focus on growing, but the hidden marketing lever is having some Vini’s and Itsmenia’s on your team. That’s what I had. I had cleaners that people knew and loved. When you have that you can almost hit a money glitch. Literally your business can grow through word of mouth the proper way. The cleaners were most important. It’s a grind at first but once you find that space cherish and respect it.\n\n**The power of niching is a great power!**\n\nWhen I first started the business I used Thumbtack, I used Yelp, I passed out flyers, I DID EVERYTHING! It all brought in clients. We did whatever because I was hungry and I needed to pay the bills. I didn’t have any other job, I did the cleaning business full time, so if you called we were going to clean it. It took me until about year 2 to understand the power of niching.\n\nWhen I finally understood, it’s like we hit another money glitch. Business got a little easier and we gained more money that made complete sense! I figured out which customer we were going to serve. We had services tailored only to their problems and aligned our systems towards solutions for only the problems they had. When I did this people found us vs us looking for them. When things got slow of course we always got back out there and took whatever that made sense, but we stayed true to the niche we chose and that’s when I started benefiting and growing the biz.\n\n**It will behoove you to become a local superstar!**\n\nIf you run any type of business and you get customers that are paying you cold hard cash and using your services or whatever you sell, pat yourself on the back! Because people online make it like getting customers in your business is easy the shit is not easy! It’s only when you finally crack it is when it becomes easy like playing a video game.\n\nWhat I realized is that you have to become a local superstar and get your business out there as much as possible. You need to shout and let everybody know what you got going on. IDC who it is because when you do, eventually you will become known for what you are doing. That’s what happened with me. I let everybody and their mother know about my cleaning business. Not only that, I invested heavily into my marketing skills.\n\nHere are the areas I can turn on with a push of a button (Facebook Ads, Google Ads and SEO, and Thumbtack and please don’t put me in a room full of people because I will get business from an event too). I will go over this in a moment. But becoming a local superstar and known for what you do is a compounding effort. If you take your business serious the support you get is the gift you receive from being undeniable. I lasted 5 years, you will be surprised how many people don’t even start. People will recognize you! People will need you and soon people will start calling you. It’s up to you to step to the plate and perform.\n\n**You need flow.**\n\nWhenever I expressed hardship in my business, my friend who runs a million dollar + landscaping business would always say fill up your pipeline. A pipeline in business does solve problems and should not be approached lightly. I will say you need to approach this as if someone is trying to take literal food from your loved one’s mouth. As if it’s life or death because truly if you aren’t getting customers you will eventually go flat. This means you need customers coming in from multiple areas.\n\nWhat I did was have paid ads and organic flows. For each area I put a system in place. I learned and put time into each area and it wasn’t all at the same time either. It started with the platforms like thumbtack, then I got decent with organic social media, decent with paid ads (FB &amp; Google Ads), then I met the Yoda of Online Marketing, SEO. I wasn’t good at the beginning but over time I got good at each stop, built a system around it and kept it going. I’m not saying go and do all of this because it’s time consuming.\n\nWhat I am saying is that each system that got built all went into either the residential pipeline or commercial pipeline. My main goal was to get new people in the doors that I can talk to. I kept my pipeline full! \n\nA glitch is letting people know about your cleaning business on stage at local events. I constantly went to business events around ATL and every chance I got I grabbed the microphone and introduced my business with everyone looking. At these events people have bumrushed me for my information, to the point where I had my iPad ready to collect info and sell on spot. Take that information and do with it what you will.\n\nThen I began to get the soulful nod that it was time for me to depart from the cleaning business. It was such a journey. I once read in a book that once you finally get your business to the point where it’s running without you and things change, you can become more motivated to continue to grow that business. Not me. I’m forever grateful to the cleaning industry and have no ill will towards it, but I was able to see that it was time to go elsewhere.\n\nThe journey led me to the stop to sell my business and on Nov 3rd, after months of work to sell the business, a contract was signed! At that moment the relief I felt was so reassuring that I hit a money dance! \n\nI’m so happy to have been in the industry and started my business journey here!\n\nFor all the cleaning business owners and aspiring, keep pushing! This is an industry that is in demand. A cleaning business is a business that can provide you with whatever you need during the time of your life. Need extra money? Pick up a few houses to clean. Want to build a multi million dollar cleaning business? You can literally sign a few contracts and be at a million with a cleaning business. It’s whatever you want it to be. Not saying it’ll be easy but the money is there!\n\n\n\nI wish you all luck! And if you read this far, thank you!",

I’ve been in the cleaning business for 40 years. Started back in 1985 after 2 years of college. No internet, no computers, no software, no google, just the good old yellow pages and a local newspaper. I worked (cleaning) in the business early on (I really enjoyed cleaning) I’ve seen a lot of cleaning companies come and go over 40 years. You can scale a cleaning business with modern technology today but to sustain the business you need good systems and processes in place and someone to oversee operations. \nRohan Gilkes of Launch 27 (a software scheduling company) was a pioneer in helping cleaning businesses with easy scheduling and payment systems back in 2014. Today there are plenty of scheduling software’s available. Zenmaid, Jobber, just to name a few \nThere are also a few cleaning gurus out there that can help you grow your business \nDebbie Sardone has a great program , Cleaning Business Fundamentals (CBF)\nAnd yes, the key to every business is great employees, in our cleaning business, our employees stay an average of 8 years (I believe 5 years is the industry standard)\nToday, I work in the office with another person, we have someone who does our marketing, and 14-16 employees. \nThe best of luck to everyone.",

      "selftext": "Back when I was taking my first steps as an entrepreneur, most of the people in my environment warned me about the riskiness of running my own business, and how less than 10% of all startups survive their first year. \"It most likely won't succeed\", they told me, \"Odds are against you\", and every other platitude most of us here have heard for God knows how many times.\n\nThe one thing no one warned me about was the Pandora's box of hardships that were to be unsealed once I got over that first hill and made it out of the Startup Phase.\n\n# Early Game\n\nI started my company three years ago with a simple premise: helping other small companies in my niche field market their products creatively and efficiently. I had a pretty unique strategy that resonated well with my ICP, and my focus was on quality and genuineness, which clients quickly picked up on. I secured a few long-term jobs early on with a, I'd say, less than 1% chance as a fresh-from-college unknown that I was. But they saw something in me and gave me a chance, and I couldn't have been happier about it.\n\nOh yes, and my prices were low. Like *really* low - I charged around $1000 for a month of work on multiple platforms. At the time, that money was *wow* for me, but looking from today's perspective, a petty change for the businesses I was reaching out to.\n\nI also got recommendations from influential people in the field who believed in me and did their best to help. That was *the* lucky moment for my business, and probably the main reason I survived that first year. Cash was coming in, people were satisfied with my work, I soon added another person to the company, and it all made me think *“*Damn, I cracked it. This is it.*”*\n\nBut here’s the part no one tells you:\n\n**Early success blinds you.** You think the momentum will last forever. You think scaling is just “copy what works, add more people\" but that can't be further from the truth.\n\nAnother year passed without much change. For sales, I mostly relied on the uniqueness of my services and the creative, out-of-the-box approach that I \"patented\". It was easy to sell, especially for the price that I held at the time. For operations - we established some routines and recurring processes, created the first version of our one-pager website on Carrd, and added another person to the team.\n\nThe business was on a smooth sail - some months we made enough to comfortably survive, some to consider expanding further. By this time, we had made enough money to make some improvements on the official stuff - website, service deck, contracts, etc. We could pay for tools like ChatGPT Enterprise, Lovable AI, Notion Business, Slack, etc., hire designers and coders from Devoted Fusion and Devoted Studios, or just outsource some of the work we're not skilled at to the professionals.\n\nHowever, there was another trouble quietly brewing during this \"expansion\" period. As the company started growing, the business also started running into some issues, and it was all about to come crashing down on me.\n\n# Expansion Phase\n\nBefore we dive into the issues that I faced and how I overcame them, I'd like to note that my goal here is not to demotivate people from wandering down the entrepreneurial path; but rather help them face these obstacles ready and capable, because they *will* come. Let's dive into them now:\n\n* **My business was based on high-quality services. However, controlling the quality of the output became harder as I employed more people.**\n   * My solution: 3-4 months of 1:1, 1-2 hour-long training/teaching of the new employees before they start working without my monitoring. I retained the quality to, I'd say 70-80%, but training new people became especially time-consuming.\n* **Uniqueness of my approach** \\- the main thing that helped sell my campaigns easily became an issue when it came to finding talent. Uniqueness meant that finding highly specialized people was almost impossible, so I had to rely on other methods.\n   * My solution: Employ people who show high generalized creative and analytical skills, then teach them to do the exact work - instead of relying on employing the experts in the field who were too few and too expensive. Made it easier to find new talent, but more time consuming and required more dedicated training.\n* **I had to raise prices (otherwise I'd drown), and this brought 3 issues:**\n   * a) Selling became harder. $1000 for multi-platform work was a no-brainer for most people interested in my services. Change that to $2000+ per platform, and suddenly you'll find yourself looking at weeks of internal consideration by the prospects before they even give you a definite yes or no. Plus, you'll flat out sell less.\n   * b) If you're selling your work for much lower than the market average (even in my scenario with unique services, there *was* an estimated market average), barely anyone asks for case studies, numbers, or proof of work. I remember getting so used to the relaxing meetings where I'd sell in the first 15 minutes, and then spend the rest of the time just chatting with the new client about some unrelated stuff. Once you raise the prices, suddenly you'll find yourself spending 45 minutes explaining every itty bitty detail about the work you do and showing proof, testimonials, and recommendations. Oh, and prospects *will* reach out to the people in your testimonials, so don't even think about faking them.\n   * c) You're now competing with the bigger fish. One thing nobody taught you when you were starting was that the price brackets were real. The moment you raise your prices and cross into the next price bracket, even by a cent, you're competing with the more established, better organized, and better backed-up companies. As a small company with dirt low prices, you were like a puppy that everyone wanted to help out. Sure, they'll let you bring the newspaper every morning for a few pennies, and no, it's not a problem if it ends up a little wet. But now, you're a grown up dog with a few scars on your face and everyone's expecting real, hard-proven value from you. You'll have to bark at the mailman, bring the newspaper without a single drop on it, and be ready to play whenever that's expected from you. Oh, and before that, you'll have to convince everyone why it's better to adopt you rather than a highly-trained veteran who already knows every mailman by their scent from a mile away.\n* **Organization**\n   * By this time, you already need to hire an all-around HR who can handle hiring &amp; onboarding processes during the hiring times, and people management during the times when you're not hiring. You also need to find the best tools to organize your work because there's too many people and too many projects to keep track of yourself. I tried multiple because one wasn't enough - Notion worked really well for compiling and organizing raw data, Google Sheets were awesome for keeping track of clients and campaigns because of their simplistic, very clear design, and ChatGPT helped with structuring and automating some parts of the operations.\n   * Legal, Financial, and Administrative advisors are a MUST. Find the best ones you can afford and ask for a long-term subscription where they'd help with any legal documents, financial advising, and administrative tasks when needed, but since you won't have them all the time, you'll pay a lower subscription price.\n* **Surviving your growth**\n   * As you can imagine, all of these raise your company's expenses a lot. It's not as simple as subtracting a few salaries and taxes from your total revenue now; **YOU NEED** financial optimization. Understanding how to do things cheaper, what to pay for and what to do yourself, and ultimately, minimizing the expenses while retaining the quality is crucial.\n   * I managed to save about $4000 on revamping my website and service deck by hiring designers from Devoted Fusion (they were also kind enough to lend me a programmer from their main company, Devoted Studios, who helped with improving and optimizeing the code on the website), figuring out the right prompting strategy with ChatGPT, to finally using all of that and create a website with Lovable AI instead of paying for one. It cost me about 20 hours of work in total (mind that I would have to spend at least 10 hours anyway compiling all the data for the website and doing the copywriting) to build a website from scratch. Just 10 hours of extra work to save $4000+. ChatGPT helped me with the strategy and the right prompts, and I hired a talented designer from Devoted Fusion who helped with the logo and the website's overall design. Then Lovable did all the manual lifting for me and put together a website that, after about 400 prompts, looked exactly the way I wanted it to.\n* **High-level decisions**\n   * Do you stay in the same industry and expand by adding different services/products to your deck, or commit to your main few services/products but expand to other industries? Do you employ AI tools/agents to cover and automatize some of the work, or rely on adding more employees? Is the industry you're part of sinking without a sign that it'll get better soon, or is it just starting to grow? And in regards to this - should you stick to the industry so once it starts growing you already have established reputation and renown; or you pivot to a different industry? Do you sacrifice your health yet again and push harder just that one more time to reach a goal? And if so, what's the threshold after which your health will be sacrtificed so many times that you'll have to take some time off?\n\n**All of these made me realize that, while it's often considered that the real testament of a company is how it survived the Startup Phase, the second part - Expansion - is actually the most important (and the most stressful) one**. My health deteriorated during this period under the sheer weight of all the responsibilities and the stress that was coming with them; and the worst part is - people barely mention that.\n\n**When you're just starting a company, you're excited, motivated, fresh, and probably coming from a more or less healthy spot**. These psychological and biological factors play a crucial role in your ability to handle responsibilities - you're more resistant to stress, less likely to blow up because of a minor issue that reappeared yet again, and overall more excited to do your work. 12-hour working days? You bet it. Weeks or even months during which your company is your main and only focus? Say no more.\n\nOn the other hand, **after 3 years, it's very likely that your motivation won't be as high as it used to be, you'll be more worn out both mentally and physically**. Daily stress won't just be a nuisance you signed up for when starting a company, but a ticking bomb in your head.\n\nHowever, there are also some beautiful things about entrepreneurship at this stage. First of all, **once you've reached that Expansion stage, you'll feel like a goddamn king of the world**. You officially made it, you managed to grow a successful and growing business, and you're making enough to live a comfortable life. Great job!\n\nYou've also developed dozens of very useful skills that will always be of value, and you've learned a few things about succeeding in life. People from your industry respect you, you have partners and friends who speak highly of you and your business, and generally, yo feel like you're doing the right thing... because you are!\n\n# Closing Insights\n\n**Entrepreneurship will cost you a lot**. More than most people can even imagine, and definitely more than anyone realizes when they're first starting. But it also gives a lot.\n\n**I am an entrepreneur**. I was born with entrepreneurship in my veins, I couldn't hold a regular job for more than two months, and couldn't ever imagine being stuck in an office for 40 years... or until I die, hopefully earlier than that. Sometimes, I question my decision and envy not being able to finish my work at 5 in the afternoon, and just forget about it until tomorrow morning. I envy not being able to have a coffee with my friends when I want, chit chat about random, daily happenings, and go back home to watch a movie. But then I realize that no hobby, no coffee with friends, and no movies could make me feel the way building my own business does. The life of an entrepreneur is built to look like a fairytale. It's not a fairytale for sure, even if you're successful, but it's a damn fun journey that you'll eternally fall in love with.",

It can basically make production changes to our web app from simple prompts, test changes, and improve automatically based on memory!\n2. Youform: A far cheaper alternative to Typeform! Basically their free version gives you unlimited forms with their branding! You just have to pay to remove or customize branding basically! Saves $100s of dollars for us!\n3. Frizerly: Their AI agent that learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website to help you improve your Google ranking is pretty impressive! It can auto identify content gaps from competitors, improve based on results etc! Much better tool than Semrush etc imo!\n4. Perplexity: I think most people use ChatGPT and that is great. But for real time news and updates, Perplexity is great! You can basically setup a daily automation where it will pull relevant updates for you and auto send you a summary!\n5. Sierra: Sierra is really good at auto resolving repetitive customer support tickets! It can learn from both past answers, your internal docs, faqs etc! We have gotten it to be able to resolve about 50% of all tickets instantly while rest are routed to real humans\n6. Gamma: After every client meeting. I get an AI Zoom Summary, it is then automated through Gamma. Gamma generates the final PPT for myself and client on what we discuss in summary and the next steps. Clients love that.\n\nExcited to learn from others!",

Typedream:** Perfect for building up landing pages in minutes.   \n2. **Raycast:** command bar that saves microseconds (which add up fast).  \n**3. Surfer:** This one I like the most as their AI agents read about your competitors and about your business in details and based on the research it automatically publish SEO blog on your website that helps you get ranking faster organically... Personally my fav!!  \n**4. Zapier + Tally:**  Helps in doing the tiny automations and massive sanity. \n\nThe game isn’t adding more tools. It’s more about finding the ones that give your brain more free space.\n\nCurious what others use, I’m always hunting for the **“small but magic”** ones.",

If you can focus on this text that is already a good sign, if you can't focus and skim over it - please recognize that the social media algorithms already reduced your attention span (important to get the head space back to actually execute on things). \n\nSo: Do not use your last $200 to \"start something\". It's gonna burn pretty quickly and it may be important at this stage to learn something. \n\nThere are a few \"free\" ways to make money from the online tools available. I'll make a list and then briefly discuss the points - if one of them seems good for you, we can discuss more in the comments and I'm happy to have fellow people jump in to help you here and even correct what I am saying. \n\n1) Expertise   \n2) Print-on-Demand (anything) + Social Advertising  \n3) Be a Broker for anything   \n4) Sales / Appointment Setter  \n5) Be someones \"right hand\"  \n6) Renting out your time for services\n\n1) Expertise: If you have ANY skill that you think is worthwhile, there are ways to monetize the skill as people wanna learn. Know how to meditate or yoga? To build muscle? To do video/photo editing? To grow plants...  \n\\--&gt; There are people willing to pay for it. Think someone elderly with a day job needs some motivation to go to the Gym and do the correct type of exercise --&gt; Be a paid trainer and ask them to refer you to friends once the rapport is built. \n\n2) Print on Demand: Have cool ideas for sentences / graphics / memes to print on something? T-Shirts, Coffee Mugs, Wall-Art &amp; Posters? There are print on demand platforms that let you upload and connect to market places like Etsy --&gt; Register, Upload designs and set prices (needs some semi-smart calculations still), then advertise these through clever videos (using your phone camera and tiktok/IG and other social media). \n\n3) Brokering means you don't own it as a seller and you're not going to be the buyer, you are the intermediate \"middle man\" who connects both sides. For houses, cars, machines, landscaping services, list goes on. You basically find the buyers and only connect them to the respective sellers once you have figured out a commission with the sellers. Example: Go to a local gardening service and say \"what would you give me if I brought you 5-10 new clients a month?\" some will be willing to give you a shot. Same for housing although that requires you to get yourself a license in most western countries. \n\n4) Sales/Appointment Setter --&gt; Especially in AI and tech there are many open positions for people to just call up a bunch of local businesses that might be in need of AI or Tech services that these companies offer, sometimes its already enough to get the \"leads\", the potentially interested local businesses to commit to a 15 minute phone call with the sales agent --&gt; mostly through a job that is somewhat mixed between fixed income and commission. \n\n5) Be someones \"right hand\" - Find some entrepreneur or business that you respect - offer them to help for a little salary. Be their right hand man / assistant for anything. You'll learn a lot and get a bit of money to help you support your life - as you grow into that role he may offer you more opportunities or you tend to spot an opportunity yourself. At your age thats pretty neat as most 20 year olds could use that learning for their future much more than some hundred bucks. \n\n6) Renting out your time for services - typically very American, but thats why it works here in Europe. Go around houses in older residential 1 family house areas around your town / next biggest city and knock on doors to offer to clean all their windows, clean their cars, maintain their garden / frontyard. whoever doesnt open the door, you put a flyer into their mailbox with an offer that looks not super professional but rather like a 20 year old who wants to get to a next step --&gt; normally local people respect young kids for that type of effort and will offer them a shot at whatever it is they need help with. \n\nAll of this requires some sort of confidence, intellect, willingness to endure and sympathy - the more digital the more intellect needed, the more offline the more sympathy is needed. You know best what category fits you better.",

Can take years to do the set up before all channels of your business are mature enough to draw in real revenue. \n\nRule 1: You need money to make money.\n\nTo start, go get a sales rep job (not a clerk/front desk). Doesn’t matter where or what industry. Sales jobs have a low bar of entry and a lot of overturn so they are always hiring. Just show you’re passionate, a people person, and hungry for success and you will land something in a few interviews. \n\nSales is the bread and butter of business, so this gives you a way to develop your sales techniques while getting paid. You will learn about sales pipelines, validating clients, dealing with “smokescreen”, etc. Sales positions are mostly commission based, meaning you won’t make much money till you get a sale. So it may take you 10hr work days to grind for the first few months to finally hit some sales numbers. \n\nBest positions for someone in your situation would be salary+comission. You get paid even if you don’t make sales, and get a bonus for every sale you make. Your potential max earning is lower than a pure commission position, but the minimum income will help keep the stress off and keep you level headed. A position with this pay structure would be those people who sell you services at Costco or other shopping centers (I’m not in UK so idk what a proper equivalent would be). \n\nGrind. Learn. Make yourself excel. Hit a 6 figure job in 3-5 years. With your extra money and time, tinker with ideas and potential business. After understanding sales process and creating client bases, how to turn your idea into a business will be more apparent to you. \n\nGood luck!",

So if you need 25/hour, you MUST charge 50/hour. In the beginning you can cheat that just to get customers and beat your competition on price, but over time you need to get there or you will die in stage 2.\n\nAs you get more customers you will get too many to handle yourself so you will hire your first employee.\n\nStage 2 - Around 5 employees you will hit a block where you arent making enough from them to pay for yourself so you will have to manage them and work on jobs. You will be having to interview new employees, find new business, work on jobs, do the financials/logistics, and manage existing employees to make sure they are doing a good job. This will be terrible.\n\nYou might try to blast through that as fast as possible, but some of the employees will be bad and you will have to fire them (wasting time) kiss up to customers who are mad, and hire their replacements or do the work yourself. This will be really terrible and you will question if it is all worth it.\n\nStage 3 - Once you get to 8-10 employees they are now making enough that you dont have to work on jobs and you can transition to focus entirely on getting new business, ensuring your employees are doing quality work etc.\n\nAs you get more workers you can start to hire a bookkeeper, sales staff, marketing etc.\n\nYour job will be to make sure they do a good job. Many wont and your #1 headache will always be your employees and how terrible they are :) I typically have to hire and fire about 5 people before I learn how to hire for a particular job. This is extremely painful and time consuming.\n\nStage 4-  You are making a ton of money, find you can relax a lot. You will likely make the mistake of turning your whole business over to someone else, this wont workout and can kill your business. Maybe they steal all the money or just do a bad job.\n\nAlso from a valuation perspective when you want to sell, recurring revenue from subscriptions is worth a lot more than project work. You can get 1X revenue with project work and 2-3X revenue valuation with recurring revenue",

      "selftext": "I’ve been meaning to post this for a while. I started lurking on forums and subreddits about reselling around 2017. Back then, I was the guy asking everyone what the best niches were and how to find them.\n\nI’ll never forget one response I got. The person said, “First, why would I tell you my niche? Then I’d have a competitor. Second, your niche should find you organically, and it should be something you actually enjoy.”\n\nI felt a little disinterested after hearing that. I went on with the normal job grind, learning IT, getting certifications, and eventually an AS degree. The jobs were okay, but I always felt like I was wasting my time. Shout out to anyone who loves IT, I met plenty of people who were happy with it.\n\nIn 2019, I tried reselling thrifted clothes and computer parts. I lost my ass on eBay fees, shipping, and supplies. I didn’t know what I was doing and eventually gave up. I never quit my day job, thinking reselling just wasn’t for me.\n\nThen in 2022, I got into a specific collectable niche. It’s a hobby that so many people love, and there are endless avenues you can take. I bought my first piece and fell in love with it. I dove into the lore and became obsessed in a healthy way. About a year later it clicked.\n\nI relaunched my platforms, built a website, and started tracking profit and loss. Slowly the numbers started climbing. Now I sell this niche full time and I genuinely enjoy what I do. I love when people ask me what I do and when friends and family come to me with questions.\n\nIt’s a tangible item that people enjoy, and some pieces can even be passed down or traded depending on rarity.\n\nLooking back, that Reddit user from years ago was right. Your niche should find you. You don’t have to chase the perfect thing. I found something I liked, never planned to sell it, and because I naturally gravitated toward it, it made sense.\n\nYou can do it too.\n\n(I am open to answer questions broadly and provide some motivation and direction) ",

Customer interviews, competitor pricing pages, reviews on sites like Reddit, G2, and Amazon, job listings, forums, and even sales calls can provide much more insight than polished reports. Scraping public information, running small paid tests, or talking directly to suppliers can offer surprisingly accurate insights at a low cost.\n\nIn practice, early businesses succeed not by having perfect data but by learning faster than their assumptions fail.

If you are actually serious about anything you're doing, which it seems like you are, you will avoid using AI for anything proprietary like the plague. If you use AI ***you will not be able to trademark your own logo***. You may not even be protected under common IP or copyright laws, though I'm unsure (but pretty sure). Do what some of the other comments are saying and go through 99designs or Upwork. Fiverr might be good too, however you might have to comb through for longer. Make sure that whoever you go through is going through all the proper avenues to ensure you own the design once it's created. Expect to spend at least a few hundred dollars for each of the things you listed. Full-on branding kits by professionals are often a couple thousand bucks.\n\nBest of luck",

Make sure that you receive the source file for the logo. That is often an Adobe Illustrator .ai file. The source file allows you to repurpose and create versions of the logo in the future without being dependant on the original designer for any changes. Some designers make have a practice of retaining the source file, but I don't agree with that. On Fiverr some designers don't include the source file with their basic level plan. Look out for that.",

Budget platforms can be risky for this since you might run into licensing issues down the road.\n\nAsk if they provide vector files.

I'd actually suggest looking at designers who've worked with food brands before, even if they cost a bit more upfront.

Loads of brilliant illustrators or web designers are terrible at logo work because it's such a different skillset.

Also worth asking upfront about file formats and usage rights, because some designers on cheaper platforms will try to retain partial ownership or charge extra for vector files later.

After a budget review last week where I had been given \\_zero\\_ guidance as to what I could spend, then receiving mundane questions 'have you tried using AI on that?' - I had a realization that I am better than these people who are getting &gt;$1M in total comp each per year. Call that arrogant, and I'm sure I'm lacking in other skills, but its been a consistent issue for me. \n\nQuestion is, what do I do about it? I'm wondering what other people did in my place? I can't seem to nail a good idea for a company, but I feel like that is the only way I can really feel empowered. I know that ultimately the customer/board will be my boss, but that's surely better than clueless executives? ",

          "body": "This feeling is common, but there is a trap hidden in it.\n\nBeing frustrated by bad leadership does not automatically mean you are ready to be a founder. A lot of founders look clueless because their job is not execution in a single lane. It is fundraising, people management, politics, tradeoffs, timing, and eating blame. From the outside it often looks like stupidity when it is actually context you do not see.\n\nThat said, if you genuinely cannot tolerate working under poor vision, the answer is not wait for a perfect idea. Almost nobody starts with one.\n\nWhat people in your position usually do successfully is this\nThey stop looking for a big company idea and start selling a narrow outcome they already know how to deliver. Consulting, contracting, freelancing, productized services. One problem, one customer type, one promise. That gives you autonomy without pretending you have figured everything out.\n\nYou also learn very fast whether your confidence is justified. Customers do not care how dumb your old bosses were. They only care if you can solve their problem and keep showing up.\n\nIf you cannot make money independently in a small way, founding a company will magnify the same frustration you already feel.\n\nStart small. Get paid directly by someone who chooses you. Let reality validate whether you should be in the founder seat or whether you just need more control over how you work.",

It needs to be something you can actually execute on and test quickly.\n\nOne thing that helped me was keeping a running list of every friction point I hit in my day job. Not big visionary stuff, just annoying repetitive tasks that ate time. After a few months you start seeing patterns - and those patterns are usually shared by thousands of other people in similar roles.\n\nThe executives you're frustrated with? Their job isn't execution, it's capital allocation and politics. Different skillset entirely. Doesn't make them smarter, but their incompetence at operational details doesn't automatically mean you'd be good at their job either. The reverse is also true though - you might be great at building something they'd never be able to.",

      "selftext": "I'm building a relationship app that helps couples understand how their bio rhythms affect each other to improve timing and reduce misunderstandings. It's science-backed (hormone tracking, sleep patterns, stress levels, cycle predictions/notifications), but I'm struggling with how much science to show users.\n\n**Dilemma:**\n\nI'm targeting a general relationship improvement niche, but displaying too much biology-related content (hormone names, technical terms, clinical calendar) doesn't seem like the right approach.\n\n**I see two paths:**\n\n1. Make it user-friendly -&gt; Hide the biology, use relationship-focused language, target the broader relationship market (my preference)\n2. Lean into the science -&gt; Keep biology terms, target biohackers/science-leaning users (smaller but more engaged niche)\n\nI want to go with option 1, but I need advice on how to balance credibility with accessibility.\n\n**What successful science-backed apps do (based on my research):**\n\nApps that hide the science:\n\n* MyFitnessPal - Shows calories/macros, zero research citations\n* Headspace - Minimal science, focuses on experience\n* Strava - Performance metrics, no research shown\n* Duolingo - Uses spaced repetition without explaining it and makes it fun\n\nApps that show some science:\n\n* Sleep Cycle - Basic sleep science in educational content\n* Ada (symptom checker) - References medical sources when explaining\n\n**The problem:**\n\n* Marketing says: \"Unlock your best relationship\", \"Fewer dumb arguments\", \"Understand each other's rhythms\"\n* Product feels like: Medical/period tracking app with some partner features\n* Users want: Relationship help, not biology lessons (**my assumption**)\n\n**Important context:**\n\nThe app tracks multiple metrics (sleep, stress, cycle, etc.) for both partners, and they can share this data with each other. The goal is to help couples understand the full picture of what affects each other's wellbeing, not to reduce anyone to a single biological factor or use it to explain away legitimate issues. It's about seeing the complete context of how both partners' rhythms interact.\n\n**My questions:**\n\n1. Should I hide the biology/calendar behind relationship-focused language?\n2. Do successful consumer health apps show science, or just use it behind the scenes?\n3. Is showing hormone names/technical terms a retention killer for non-medical apps?\n4. Has anyone faced this? What's worked for you?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nP.S. I apologize for the long post but I had to make it as clear as possible.",

With a human you tend to have to be honest.\n\nPeople often don’t need comfort, they just need a place to reflect. It’s odd to vent in a place where no response at all would be provided. LLMs provide instant responses, and since LLMs are great at mirroring yourself back at you, they’re great tools for reflecting.\n\nI’ve whined about accidentally breaking a pencil I liked once to an AI, made it sound all emotional and stuff, just cause it’s interesting and it’s a good place to vent about little things. I completely intensified the conversation for more intense responses. Can you image if I did that with a human?",

I tried counseling for 2 months but youtube is frankly more helpful than that woman. I’ve had female friends who had similar in varying degrees the same trauma and issues i’m complaining about in the culture and religion so it’s inevitable that as a woman who evolved beyond the passed down culture and trauma, you’d disconnect if they haven’t individualized. And it’s very rare to find people in the Philippines who have learned to separate themselves and their identity from that of family, religion and culture. I bargained with a female, US trained, therapist but the rate is 69usd per 45min. session, something i still cannot afford to allot money on for months to a year as there are a lot to unpack. So the easiest when i get triggered is chatgpt. 9/10 times i iust need to read her validating statements in order for me to cry and recalibrate my nervous system by journaling, breathe work and reframing the thoughts. So many tools available but sometimes in a way you just wanna hear that soft, it’s ok, i get it, that’s understandable, you’re just being human, with feelings and boundaries that are constantly being disrespected time and time again even after communicating them. Type of words that sometimes need to come externally especially if you’ve been gaslighted all your life. \n\nMy life would be easier if i’m not in the Philippines but while i’m here, chatgpt is my only therapist or friend.

In my experience, the challenge is making sure the advice is actually useful and tailored to the individual. I’ve been experimenting with tools that help people communicate and collaborate better, and we’ve found that the AI works best when it has some understanding of the person or uses established psychometrics. Curious to see how your experiments go, especially around managing interpersonal situations. I think it be interesting to compare notes sometime.",

I've optimized and was basically retired with just a couple employees each running a couple businesses with everything else running itself.  I learned one employee stopped working entirely so fired him and started working again part-time.  I'm planning a major growth and working to really start to scale all these businesses up and investing millions to hire teams of employees, but really struggling to get it off the ground.\n\nI have money, I have solid businesses and I have everything prepped.  I just don't have any management, sales or processes built.    \n\nA few months back I hired an employee to assist in operations and help setup all my systems and untangle everything from the previous employees and get things organized. Make sure the office is ready and sales is prepped.   The problem is he doesn't work unless I keep handing him things to do and I'm busy trying to do all my work in scaling I don't have time to delegate to him.\n\nI figured I have 6+ months of work with just us before I can start hiring teams and really grow.  Everything is moving incredibly slow.   I make great money but also blow a TON personally so lifestyle creep is real.   \n\nThe thing is I need someone to manage them and I need someone to sell and someone to market and someone to do the work and office/operations.   I can do the work and finance and business side.   The problem is I feel like I need 3 hours of each of those but can't really find someone to do all of this and every time I try it get none of it done right.  \n\nCurrently I feel like if I'm not constantly handing out work and finding things to do, nothing gets done, and 90% of the work they can't do or I'm constantly having to fix things or finalize them because they don't really know what they're doing. \n\nHow do you guys scale without taking on ALL the work constantly?  I'm not sure how I can hire and delegate multiple roles without micromanaging and focus on my side of the business.   ",

The hardest transition I ever made was going from doing everything myself to trusting other people to handle pieces of my business. And I still struggle with it after 40+ years.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you - that employee who needs constant direction? That's actually pretty normal. Most people aren't entrepreneurs, they're executors. They need clear tasks, deadlines, and someone checking in. I learned this the hard way when I was scaling my consulting firm. I kept hiring smart people and expecting them to just \"figure it out\" like I would. Spoiler alert: they won't. What worked for me was creating super detailed SOPs for literally everything. Like stupidly detailed. \"Step 1: Open email. Step 2: Look for emails marked urgent.\" That level of detail. It felt ridiculous at first but it freed up so much of my time once people could actually follow the processes without me.\n\nThe other thing - and this might sound counterintuitive - but sometimes hiring part-time specialists works better than trying to find that unicorn who can do sales AND marketing AND operations. When I was running Digital Guard Force, I had this vision of finding these amazing generalists who could wear multiple hats. Total waste of time and money. Instead, I started bringing in contractors for specific functions. 10 hours a week of a killer salesperson beats 40 hours of someone who sort of knows sales. Plus you're not paying benefits and you can scale up or down as needed. The trick is finding someone who can coordinate all these part-timers - that's where a good operations person becomes worth their weight in gold. But again, you gotta train them first on YOUR specific way of doing things.",

          "body": "Full transparency: I’m not at your level yet in terms of business value, but I’m aiming to get there.\n\nFrom your post and your replies, it sounds like you expect a lot from employees. And to entrepreneurs, that “a lot” often feels normal, because we’re wired to problem solve and keep pushing even after the workday ends. Most employees aren’t like that. They clock out, mentally disconnect, and only deal with problems again when the next shift starts. That’s not even laziness, it’s how most people are.\n\nSo the core issue might not be “finding smarter employees”, but building the right structure around the role.\n\nWhat you likely need is built in processes: clarity on what the job actually is, what the recurring tasks are, what “good” looks like, and how you want things done in your business. You mentioned the job constantly brings new problems, which makes processes harder to create. But that’s exactly why you need them. The process shouldn’t only be a checklist for predictable tasks; it should include a framework for how to handle unpredictable problems.\n\nIn other words, teach them how to think like you do when something new pops up:\n\n* how to diagnose the issue\n* what to check first\n* what questions to ask\n* what “good enough” looks like vs when to escalate\n* how to decide between options\n* how to document the solution so it’s easier next time\n\nThat framework lets them solve new issues without needing you for every decision.\n\nAlso, education is overrated for this specific problem. Education usually provides foundational knowledge and basic competence. It helps people understand the subject. But a job still requires guidance on how to execute tasks in *your* company, in *your* way, with *your* standards. Most people still need that direction, even if they’re qualified on paper.\n\nTL;DR: Education = basic understanding. Real performance = guidance + systems + feedback loops.\n\nSo I’d boil it down to two requirements:\n\n1. **Frameworks/processes** that cover both routine work and “new problem” situations.\n2. **A manager/team lead** (or someone acting as one), even with just 2 employees, if you can’t be available daily. Someone has to do the coaching, the prioritizing, and the decision support.\n\nBecause people who can consistently operate with zero guidance and drive outcomes the way an entrepreneur does are usually the people who end up building their own thing, not staying an employee.",

I was in almost this exact spot last year - profitable business, ready to grow, but every hire felt like I was just adding another dependent instead of getting leverage. What finally clicked for me was realizing I wasn't hiring for the right thing first. You don't need another task-doer right now - you need someone who can BUILD the systems that task-doers will follow. But finding that person who can actually operate without a playbook? Nearly impossible.   \n  \nI ended up using Billie for like, three months as a weird stopgap. Just started dumping all the \"setup\" tasks there - \"build a sales outreach process doc\" or \"research and compare CRM options for our needs\" or even \"draft standard operating procedures for client onboarding.\" It wasn't perfect but it got the foundational stuff out of my head and into some usable format, which meant when I DID finally hire a ops manager, they had something to work from and improve instead of starting from zero. It's still a mindset shift though. You gotta accept that things won't be done exactly how you'd do them at first. The goal is 80% right and off your plate, not 100% perfect and still in your lap.

It's that you don't have documented processes for any of those things yet. When you say your employee \"doesn't work unless you keep handing him things to do\" - that's actually normal. He has no playbook, no clear outcomes to hit, no way to know if he's succeeding.\n\n\n\nI had to learn this the hard way: you can't delegate what you haven't systematized first. Before I hired anyone else, I spent about 2 months just documenting every single thing I did. Not perfectly, just good enough. Every client interaction, every process, every decision point. Then I hired ONE person to execute ONE of those documented systems, not three people to figure out three undefined roles.\n\n\n\nStart with operations since that's foundational to everything else. Get that person to document and optimize what already works before you add complexity. Once that's running smooth, then layer in the next role. Trying to build sales, marketing, and operations simultaneously while also scaling is why everything feels slow and broken.\n\n\n\nThe money you're spending on that employee right now?

It did cost me 2 years of depression, wrong co-founds too long, wrong features too long, bad clients too long and bad feelings for too long. If i just would have been sitting down and asking myself that question i could have taken a shortcut many times.",

          "body": "I think you’re already ahead of a lot of people just by questioning it. The online “hustle” culture massively oversells the upside and barely mentions the trade-offs. Running a business can be brilliant, but it’s not freedom by default especially at the start. You usually swap one boss for many, income is inconsistent, the stress follows you home, and when something breaks it’s on you. There are long stretches where you’re working harder than you ever would in a job and wondering why you didn’t just take a stable salary.\n\nThat said, if you genuinely enjoy problem-solving, responsibility, and building something over time, it can be deeply satisfying in a way employment often isn’t. The real win isn’t “easy money” or flashy success, it’s autonomy, learning at speed, and eventually designing a life that suits you but that only comes after years of uncertainty and mistakes. Starting a podcast to learn and talk to owners is actually a smart, low-risk way to see the reality up close. If you go in with eyes open and accept that it’s hard, boring, stressful *and* rewarding, you’re much more likely to do well than someone chasing the Instagram version of entrepreneurship.",

In my experience as a total newbie starting a small business, there were a lot of unexpected parts behind the scenes that didn't get talked about much.\n\nBut, one thing that surprised me early on was just how important having a solid registered agent is. It's not really something I thought about, and to be honest, that I even knew was a requirement when first forming my LLC, but my registered agent has been a life saver. In my case, reminding me about my upcoming annual report that I forgot about needing to do. Missing things like that can snowball fast into big late fees, and even having the business lose its good standing with the state. Having someone reliable to handle things quietly in the background has been a huge stress reliever for me.",

      "selftext": "Six months ago, I wanted to quit sales entirely.\n\nI'd spend 45 - 55 minutes walking someone through my automation service. They'd nod along, say \"this is exactly what we need,\" then hit me with: \"our budget is $500, can you work with that?\"\n\nI was screening people after spending an hour with them. It was backwards and it was killing me.\n\nI tracked it for two weeks: 18% close rate. 12+ hours weekly on calls with people who had no budget, no authority, or weren't even experiencing the problem I solve.\n\nI'm a builder, not a salesperson, so I did what made sense: I built a system that qualifies leads before they ever hit my calendar.\n\n# The System I Built\n\nI created a qualification agent that works in three stages:\n\n**Pre Call Agent**: When someone tries to book a call, a chatbot intercepts them before they see my calendar. It asks 3 questions conversationally:\n\n* \"What's making you look for automation right now?\"\n* \"What's your timeline for getting this solved?\"\n* \"What budget range are you working with for this?\" \n\nOnly people who pass all three get calendar access.\n\n**Enrichment Layer**: While they're answering, the system researches their company. Pulls revenue estimates, tech stack, team size, recent LinkedIn activity. Generates a one page brief that hits my inbox 60 seconds before the call.\n\n**Smart Routing**: Pain score 8+ and budget confirmed = priority calendar slots. Medium fit = educational email sequence first. Poor fit = redirected to free resources with no hard feelings.\n\n# What Actually Happened\n\n**Month 1 - 2**: The system was too aggressive. It blocked 80% of inbound. I was so paranoid about bad leads that I killed good ones too. One prospect who was actually qualified complained it felt like \"applying for a loan.\"\n\nI softened the language. Changed \"What's your budget?\" to \"What budget range are you working with for this?\" Response rate jumped from 32% to 68% just from making it conversational instead of interrogational.\n\n**Month 3 - 4**: My calendar dropped from 23 calls/month to 14 calls/month. I panicked at first.\n\nThen I looked at close rate: 36%, up from 17%. I was talking to people who actually had the problem and could afford the solution. The math was obvious: fewer calls, more revenue, zero ghosting.\n\nConversion from inquiry to booked call went to 63%. The key was asking one question at a time with personality, not bombarding people with a qualification form.\n\n**Month 5 - 6**: The enrichment layer changed everything. I started walking into calls knowing their tech stack and could say \"I see you're using HubSpot and Calendly - here's exactly where the automation plugs in.\" One prospect said \"you've done your homework\" - I hadn't, the AI had done it in 90 seconds.\n\nClose rate hit 44%. I was closing more deals in half the time because I wasn't wasting energy on unqualified prospects or doing basic research manually.\n\n# The Mistakes I Made\n\n**Over filtering early**: Set my budget minimum at $4k - $5K. Missed several $3K deals that would've been great clients and great case studies. Learned that someone saying \"$3K range\" isn't disqualified - they might not understand real pricing yet. Now I qualify on problem severity first, budget second.\n\n**Asked budget question first**: Scared people away immediately. Moved it to the third question after pain and timeline. Response completion rate went from 34% to 63% just from reordering.\n\n**No escape hatch**: Some prospects just wanted to talk to a human without answering questions. I lost 5 - 6 deals before I added a \"skip to calendar\" option. Sometimes friction kills deals, even with qualified buyers.\n\n# The Data After 6 Months\n\n* 284 booking attempts captured\n* 192 completed qualification\n* 73 passed qualification threshold\n* 52 calls actually booked\n* 27 closed clients\n\n# Why I'm Sharing This\n\n# This system works for any high ticket service business doing consultative sales. The problem is universal: you're spending hours with wrong fit prospects instead of closing real deals.\n\n# Quick question:\n\nAre you currently qualifying leads before they hit your calendar, or are you still doing it live on the call?",

The time savings compound because Kairos works 24/7 - prospects get immediate responses even when I'm sleeping.\n\nCurious - what's next on your automation roadmap?

From a different client??That’s not risk assessment.That’s straight-up hostage tactics. Also the timing is exactly how they operate:They let the payment sit long enough to clear, then freeze it the day before payout so you can’t move it. Every freelancer, agency owner, dev, and small business should be seeing posts like this. This is why so many people are moving to:\n\nPaddle\nLemonSqueezy\nPayPal Business (ironically better lately)\nWise Business\nEven crypto invoicing\n\nBecause Stripe has gotten way too comfortable playing judge, jury, and bank. The fact you escalated to AFCA, ACCC, AND Magistrates Court tells everyone reading this that you’re not some shady “high-risk” actor — you’re a normal business owner who got screwed.\n\nPlease keep updating this thread.\nPeople need to see how far Stripe will go to avoid accountability.\n\nAnd good on you for not rolling over!!!\nMost people just give up and let Stripe keep the money.",

They have a nice storefront, good instagram presence, the whole thing. Meanwhile im mostly online with a small booth at farmers markets.\n\nAnyway I got a wholesale order inquiry from a business email I didnt recognize. When I looked into it turns out its literally the owner of that other shop. She wants to buy 50 units monthly because apparently her customers keep asking for scents similar to what I make and she cant replicate them.\n\nI had no idea what to do at first, like is this weird? But then I thought about it and honestly the extra income would be great especially since I've got like $5k from Stаke for better equipment. The margins on wholesale arent amazing but its consistent money and I can probably negotiate better terms since she clearly needs my product.\n\nWe met for coffee and shes actually super cool. Turns out she specializes more in the decorative/aesthetic side and Im better at the actual scent blending. She even suggested we could do some kind of collaboration for holiday markets.",

          "body": "Honestly, this is a great opportunity as long as you structure it strategically and protect yourself. A few smart moves:\n\n1. Formalize everything in writing.\nSet terms like:\n\t•\tMinimum monthly order (e.g. 50 units)\n\t•\tPayment upfront or at least 50% deposit\n\t•\tLead times (2–4 weeks)\n\t•\tTiered pricing based on volume\n\nThat turns this from “casual help” into predictable income.\n\n2. If she wants specific scents, charge development fees.\nShe’s basically admitting she can’t replicate your formulas.\nThat’s intellectual property.\n\nA small formulation fee shows you’re not just selling candles, you’re creating unique blends.\n\n3. Only offer exclusivity if volume stays consistent.\nExample:\n“She gets exclusive access to Scent A only if she orders 50+ units every month.”\n\nIf she dips below that: exclusivity ends.\n\n4. Keep your brand identity separate.\nIf she wants private-label (your candles under her branding), raise prices.\nWhite-label should not be priced like standard wholesale.\n\n5. Use the partnership for leverage.\nYou now get to legitimately say:\n\n“Our products are carried by select retailers.”\n\nThat elevates your positioning and builds long-term credibility.\n\n6. Collaboration only if it expands your reach.\nHoliday boxes, joint booths, etc. are smart ONLY if it brings you more exposure, not just labor.\n\nBottom line:\nShe revealed that she literally cannot replace you.\nSo don’t just sell product, set terms that turn this into a reliable revenue stream and position you as the expert, not a supplier doing favors.",

After couple of meetings we almost agreed until we realized they were after the chemical composition of the soaps &amp; it was their way of taking over our business which is pretty small coz when everything is handmade the capacity is limited . My spouse is a chemical engineer and soaps are hobby besides income generation at modest scale .\n\nSo , it’s great to collaborate but watch your brand and the composition as your very own .",

You do look to be next to an apartment complex, which is good. Can you add a soda fountain, look into starting a coffee part of the business, or something else? Is there another niche that fits in with candy that you can add? \n\nAlso, you might want to consult an interior designer. When I’m buying from a locally owned store, I like it cozy and like to have lots of stuff to look at. This gives convenience store vibes and doesn’t really encourage browsing so much as driving in to buy one thing you want that you can’t get elsewhere. \n\nYour concept may need some tweaking if you want this to be sustainable. \n\nLastly, free samples are a great way to boost sales. If someone tries something they find out they like and then they buy it for many years to come, that’s bank for you. Can you open a new candy every day, cut it into bite-size pieces, and (don’t forget to list allergens) give those out? Make it a thing on social media with a calendar so that people know what day you’re opening what bars so if they want to try something specific, it draws them in.",

      "selftext": "bro idk what’s happening with clients these days but I swear every time I think “okay this project looks normal,” it turns into some next-level circus. so this guy hits me up for a *simple landing page*, literally his first message. I’m like cool man, that’s my comfort zone. easy money, quick turnaround, nothing too deep.\n\nthen he drops a google doc on me. and I’m not kidding, it looked like someone took a whatsapp rant, a horoscope prediction, a product description, shook it all together, and dumped it in one file. some lines were all caps like he was yelling at future customers. some lines were like “pls insert something that builds emotional buy-in.” bro what emotional buy-in?? from where?? like I gotta generate emotions from thin air now??\n\nand then he kept messaging every 20 minutes — “quick call?” “jump for 2 mins?” “just align energy?” (yes he actually said that once). like dude let ME work, pls. I’ve never seen someone interrupt the work they desperately want done.\n\nthe best part though… the voice notes. whispering. literally whispering like some netflix thriller villain. “make the button more… urgent.” in slow motion. I had my headphones on and jumped out of my chair because WHY ARE YOU TALKING LIKE THAT. I started wondering if this is some kind of psychological tactic or if he just genuinely talks like a broken podcast microphone.\n\nanyway I still finished the page… cleaned his chaotic copy as much as possible, fixed the flow, made it look like an actual landing page that a real human might click. I send it proudly thinking ok he’ll at least appreciate the rescue mission I did on his content.\n\nhe replies:  \n“hmm not feeling the vibe, can you make it more… green?”  \nthat’s it. no explanation. no screenshot. no “this section” or “this element.” just… green. the whole universe?? the entire landing page?? the vibe?? the soul?? I genuinely sat there staring at my screen like alright cool, this is the moment freelancing breaks me.\n\nand honestly the takeaway from this whole chaos — and I’m saying this after many similar incidents — is that weird energy in the first message is NOT a red flag… it’s a preview. and if the preview is confusing, the actual project will be 10x more confusing. but also, these clients accidentally teach you boundaries. like next time I’m setting expectations, charging extra for vague instructions, and asking for proper content BEFORE touching anything.\n\nalso maybe… just maybe… no more clients who whisper in voice notes. I deserve peace in my ears lol.",

      "selftext": "Ive owned a small hair salon for the last 12 years in NYC. When I say small, I mean we do everything “office” related from home since there’s no office in the salon. \n\nWe have several reports that we reference that have taken years to populate with sales data. Over 50 documents in Excel and Word that represent hundreds of hours of data entry and analysis. I use these reports to make my cash projection, coach my staff, make purchasing decisions: the list is endless.\n\nStarting in 2024, we used office 365 exclusively for these reports since my front desk manager and I do this work from our home computers and it was the most simple and reliable for up to date access. I mistakenly assumed that because the documents were in the cloud, this was the equivalent of having a backup.\n\nThis August, Microsoft had a problem processing my credit card on file for the annual fee (it had expired) and instead of notifying any of us on the app when we used the documents,  they sent two emails in November that looked like spam notifying me that the account was about to be cancelled. I opened the email, figured out the problem, and updated the payment info. Microsoft charged me on November 16.\n\nThe next day, November 17th, all of our documents were gone. All of them. \nI’ve spent the last 3 weeks on a series of calls with offshore support people that hang up on me when I ask to speak with a supervisor. The first week they charged me again, opened a ticket, and then called me several mornings at 7 AM to tell me they were working on it.\n\nMore phone calls, more hangups. Yesterday I found another phone number for tech support, and got someone on the phone that explained to me that all of those people had been trying to tell me that my documents were gone. \n\nObviously I should have been backing them up separately but I mistakenly thought by using the cloud system, I was.  Recreating these will take my front desk manager and I hours. This was another painful lesson in small business ownership that I had to learn by f**king up. \n\nTL:DR:\nI used Microsoft Office 365 for cloud storage and they lost over 50 Excel and Word documents that took is years to create.\n\nEdited to add: Thanks everyone for telling me I should have backed up the cloud, I agree. It's helpful to hear how everyone has their backups established. Moving forward I'll have something better set up. To me, the most painful part of being the owner of a small business is having to be an expert in everything, and when you fall short it's potentially catastrophic.",

      "selftext": "I was browsing listings for commercial properties (don’t ask why, I was just curious), and I stumbled on a mini golf course for sale about 45 minutes from where I live. It’s not huge, 18 holes, kind of old-school, with those fiberglass animals and faded turf, but it’s fully functional and comes with all the equipment. The asking price isn’t even that outrageous. Less than I expected, honestly. It’s been around since the early 2000s, and the current owner is retiring. They’ve got a snack shack, a small arcade room, and a birthday party area with plastic tables and a bouncy castle setup. It’s like a time capsule from 2007.\r\nNow I can’t stop thinking about it. I don’t even play mini golf like that, but the idea of owning a weird little roadside attraction is kind of appealing. I even went down a rabbit hole looking at mini golf props on Alibaba, they’ve got everything from pirate ships to glow-in-the-dark tunnels. I know it’s probably a terrible idea. Maintenance, insurance, seasonal traffic, all that. But part of me wants to fix it up, throw in a food truck, maybe host events. Worst case, I end up with the most chaotic backyard in the state.\r",

The restaurant is a bistro with very nice e decorations and cool jazz music in the background that was low enough for guests to hear themselves while speaking.\n\nOur second visit was a much different experience. No owner, no recommendations, and semi-attentive waitresses (all college age) that gave cursory service; but the worst of all was rap music being played very loud to a level where it was hard to hear anything at all. \n\nMy opinion is that the waitresses/cook/ staff changed the music and arrangements to what they liked, notwithstanding what the customers would like. \n\nAs a small business, it should be paramount to present a pleasant atmosphere that draws in customers.

At the risk of sounding defeatist, I feel like I’m in a fun-free loop, grinding slowly towards failure.\n\nFor over a decade I’ve run my own small video production company. I stumbled into it after being made redundant following the Financial Crisis. At first it felt exciting and full of possibility: travel, interesting projects, big hopes for creative freedom and financial stability. But over time, the reality has drifted a long way from the dream.\n\nThe industry changed faster than I could adapt, with bigger agencies moving into *my* small pond, more companies built in-house content teams, and now artifical blah blah blah intelligence has reached the point where large parts of our work can be done with a laptop and a few prompts, for peanuts. I’m working harder and harder for less reward, with shrinking creative freedom and a lower and lower ceiling on what the business could realistically become. It’s know it’s not going to be enough to give me the future I was hoping for. \n\nSomewhere along the way, this stopped feeling like something I chose and now feels like something I’m chained to. The only future I can see at the moment is bleak: a worn-out version of me, grinding away into my 60s and beyond, unable to retire properly and too tired to keep going. Ten years of sunk effort makes walking away feel like failure — but struggling on feels just as hopeless, to be honest. \n\nIs this a midlife crisis? I’m not sure. But, I worry about trying to find salaried work at my age. I spent ten years in recruitment advertising as an art director, so I can speak with authority when I say that going back into full-time employment and earning what I need in my late 50s is unrealistic. Objectively speaking, the fear is real.\n\nMaybe this is the 21st century reality for a lot of people at my age, who feel boxed in by the lives they’ve tried to build. Anyway, it’s how I feel right now, so I’m asking — genuinely:\n\n**Is anyone else going through something like this?**\n\n**Do you feel stuck in your career or business?**\n\n**How are you thinking about your future?**\n\n**Have you found any direction — or do you feel as stuck as I do, whether you’re in a salaried job or running your own thing?**  \n  \nThanks for taking the time to read.  \nAny shared thoughts will be truly appreciated.",

He drank us into some deep debts with bad business decisions and consistently running up a hundred dollar tab every night if not more, plus multiple trips to Jack In The Box to sop up the booze.  If he showed up by 11:30am I'd almost count that as being on time, and then usually he was off to the 'office store' by 2pm, which was code for going to the bar.  He stopped paying some of our suppliers, our landlord and our tax debts and verbally abused me into a shell of myself over the years.  In January 2020 he didn't show up to work and I had to break into his apartment to find him dead and naked on the floor of his bedroom.  It broke me.  I've been dealing with a lot of PTSD and anxiety issues since then.  I disappeared into my own hole of drugs and alcohol for a few years before snapping out of it.\n\nIt took me too long to realize I was in charge and could change things, but the business has been better since he passed.  I've recommitted myself to growing as a graphic designer and the quality of our finished product is so much higher now that I'm not drifting through life in a haze of weed and anxiety.  We're in a spot where we're growing and making smart business decisions, but I still don't have the cash flow I need to replace our nearly 20 year old equipment or hire on a salesman.  It always feels like we take two steps forward and then the forklift breaks down... we make real good progress redesigning the website and then the electrical box that powers our compressor pops and we've got bills I can't cover.  We always find our way through, but I know that my retirement plan is waiting for my parents to pass away, which isn't fun at all.  Sorry for the trauma dump!  I don't have too many people in the real world I can talk to about it.",

Riding that excitement and trusting my network, I started doing my own job in interior design, graphic design etc. In the beginning, it was fine, but over time I got stuck in a repetitive cycle. I kept telling myself, “This time i will reach my goal, next month, next year I’ll succeed,” and 7 years have passed. Now a truth that I didn’t want to see, has surfaced.\n\nI hesitate to look for a “normal” job because I feel like people will say, “You’ve been away from your field for so long,” so I don’t even apply. I’ve done a lot independently, and I know that compared to an office employee, I can manage projects and handle all the tough processes much faster and better, because running your own business isn’t just technical work, it’s managing the whole process.\n\nBut I feel like independent work isn’t seen as “real work,” and it’s hard to provide proof of your achievements. Continuing my own business means always looking for new clients, earning money from whatever you find, working for free for days. I no longer have goals of making money in this field, nor the excitement to create amazing work.\n\nSeeing my network on LinkedIn with their fancy titles and constant promotions depresses me. We’re in the same industry, but in my own business, they're doing only a small part of my business and that makes them managers.\n\nSo I think this feeling is not about age, but about a reality check. And I feel like breaking this cycle might mean joining a structured system, getting a job. I hope.",

          "body": "I understand the feeling of being trapped. \n\nMid-60's here and it's been very difficult the last couple of years. We're a smaller specialist agency that has very large and mid-sized enterprises for clients. Almost all of the web development we used to do is done offshore (we decided not to become an offshore agency years ago). We pivoted to high-value services that aren't easily done offshore, which helps; but the volume for an engagement is more typically in the low tens of thousands of $ instead of the hundreds of thousands. We lost our whale client a year ago and it's been a deep hole.\n\nI've explored partnering/being acquired by other companies in my business, but it's a hard sell because our business is down. So I feel forced to make this business work. I've been through the downs and ups over the last 30+ years, so it's not unrealistic to make this happen--I've done it a couple times before--but I'm getting tired of having to retrench and start over. I feel my age in that respect. And like you, I doubt that I could find a job that pays what I need--and who's hiring someone my age? So I have to make this business work better once again.\n\nWhat I take away from my experience is that I should have sold years ago when we were on an upward path. I didn't because the good times were rolling and I had built my little one-person operation into a high 7-figure, profitable company that had 60+ employees and a million dollars in cash on hand. That would have been a great time to sell. Instead I invested in a product development that I really believed in but that didn't pan out, and kept the company going when things went down. \n\nIf I had made some different decisions, I would be retired now, comfortably. As it is, I can't retire any time in the foreseeable future. Ironically, I've had a number of employees who made it all the way to retirement working in my company--I'm somewhat proud of that, almost like launching my kids in a way. But I don't share in it at this point. \n\nI don't know what the answer is, and in my business a big win can change things considerably. But I can't count on that and my runway seems shorter, and I should have become more risk-adverse with respect to putting money away rather than investing in the business--which I saw as investing in myself. That was a mistake. Those are two separate tracks. I'm in the process of figuring it out and, unlike running my business, this all seems new and not comfortable. \n\nI don't know if any of this is helpful, except maybe to say you're not alone.",

All 3 of my original partners have moved on to other things, but as a director/editor I’ve always been the most in demand. I would not be able to make nearly as much money in-house somewhere. So I press on wearing lots of hats and with a stable of freelance collaborators.\n\nAI is a tool. It is going to be used to save time and money (already cutting out transcription/translation turnarounds and scanning through footage in seconds) but the need for content is going nowhere. Brands that take themselves seriously will continue to spend money on advertising content. Someone will need to be behind the curtain using all of the tools available to create.\n\nAnd brands want to work with someone they can trust to manage a project from start to finish with all the bumps along the way as well as execute. Hard to come by in my experience. I’ve also seen companies “save money” this year by working only “in-house” and then just white labeling with us. This has meant less competitive bidding, and has worked out well.\n\nBeing a creative who keeps the books, runs payroll, handles insurance, manages the office/equipment/crew with a smile is unique. It sounds like you being a lot to the table. Find the opportunities at each brand/agency/org where you can add value. I even did payroll-only for $500k in work for a friend that’s in-house at a big brand because their AP is such a mess that they were losing vendors.\n\nWhen things were dead at the beginning of the year due to tariff fears, I called all of my contacts and asked them what their needs were. Since June it’s become our second best year ever. Plenty of factors out of our control, but if you were full time you’d have to be worried about layoffs, so try to use your strengths and experience to fill clients needs whatever they may be. Easier said, but I’ve been on the rollercoaster for a long time now and I’m still optimistic about the future of our industry. Good luck!",

My opinion, you either do it yourself and pay no one nothing (just pay the filing fees yourself) or pay a good lawyer. No one but a lawyer is going to be able to give you legal advice and stand behind it (you can sue a lawyer for malpractice if something is wrong, and they have insurance). Everyone else is a waste of money (looking at CPAs, other than tax advice). Lawyers you can ask questions and understand why things are done the way they are done. No one else is qualified to answer you without a disclaimer (which means they are not responsible for what they tell you).\n\n$1800 is a bit high, I was charging $1000. It doesn't matter if it is a single or a multiple, the benefit of a LLC doesn't depend on how many members, but how it is being operated. If you can read 2 different copies of LLC OA and can meaningly understand the differences, you don't need a lawyer. If you can tell me why you need to have a meeting with yourself and keep minutes, you don't need a lawyer.\n\nThe above is not legal advice. Consult your own lawyer.",

My state (PA) has a business hub website that will actually create a checklist for you, listing out what you need to apply for and in which order, according to the type of business you’re opening. They ask a few simple questions and then walk you through it. I imagine most states will have a similar thing. \n\nSecond most affordable is legalzoom and maybe will give you extra peace of mind/ease, so although they will upcharge you, it’s way less than a lawyer. \n\nLastly $1800 is actually a pretty affordable quote if you do want to go that route. I recommend this if your business is complicated or maybe if you have a business partner, but it’s not really necessary for most.",

I work in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction design space and it is often a new world for most clients who need a building built or remodeled. However, a recent prospect seems to be asking ChatGPT (or others) what they should ask me and sending me repeated wall of text emails, seemingly directly copied. I am finding it overwhelming to respond when many of the questions are non-sensical and inter-related. I send a measured answer and get one or two more in reply. I am not under contract yet and the project fits my wheelhouse, but the communication load is heavy to wade through these emails and respond professionally. I figure this will become more common and show up eventually with other clients. Is anyone else experiencing this or have thoughts on ways to deal with it? Thank you",

I understand my job here is to give value from my unique perspective in tech support, cybersecurity, and system administration. Getting a new client is cool but it's not the reason I respond. As a business owner, I get my own share of spam. But as a business owner, I also know I don't know everything and it is refreshing to have help when I need it. \n\nI will defend those of us who do most of our business online. We do get overly optimistic. My business is my baby. Probably spent more sleepless nights with it than my actual child. When I see a post like \"I have no clue what tech I need for my business,\" my ADHD brain goes wild. I'm a nerd. System architecture excites me. I have ADHD. My excitement is going to show through when I answer your question. I'm not worried about a sale that may or may not happen. I'm worried if my advice is going to solve your problem. \n\nReddit is just another venue for outreach like TikTok, LinkedIn, Facebook, X, Instagram, and Threads. If you're only going to take advice from local businesses you can walk to, you don't really need to be online as your network is physically there around you.

          "body": "I literally work in corporate gifting for a living. Typically larger companies, bigger budgets either by way of quantity or quality.  This is my two cents.. \n1. If you do a logo, make it small and subtle. A little icon or something less obvious is a good way to brand something without taking away usability. Using a mug as an example, a basic ceramic one with a loud logo will be the first i declutter. A nice quality one with a subtle logo would be more appreciated. \n2. If you’re not doing your own decoration, don’t pay extra to get it done. You care more about the logo than anyone receiving it. \n3. If it’s low budget, don’t buy junk… just get a giftcard. We can design beautiful gift boxes but $20 doesn’t go far without looking cheap. With a $20 amazon gift card, i can put it towards that thing I wanted, A pair of socks looks cheap. If you really want to do swag, then give something small, knowing it may be trashed, but give something else with it, like a giftcard. \n4. Echoing 3, but don’t buy the cheap version of something. A $10 cooler is still a $10 cooler… probably not very good. \n5. Real examples of interesting swag I’ve seen (not just more expensive everything): leather goods like nice coasters, key fobs, and Dopp kits. Tech organizers. Hand thrown mug with small stamped logo. Custom keyboards. Olive wood cooking utensils. Hot pads/ oven mitts. Glass togo container. Wireless charger. Mixed reactions on journals.. small accessory to go with a themed gift- ex- coffee scoop with nice coffee, chopsticks with a ramen gift, popcorn bowl with movie theme, candle snuffer with spa theme. \n\nSmall tip for anyone ordering swag. ALWAYS order more than you need, especially when on a clock. Almost every company will send a few with misprints. Obviously returns depend on the vendor, but there’s always an error",

So it’s something they’re happy to wear runnings errands or at work or going out if it’s the only hoodie in their car and they’re cold. They don’t want to feel like a billboard for your business. \n\nMy bfs company gave out A LOT of swag so many different things as well as a fuck ton of gifts at his Xmas parties. I truly miss that job for him. I got a Dyson air wrap at his last party 😭\n\nI’d say sweaters is usually a safe bet. \nBut honestly, the cost you’d get those for, most employees would honestly rather have the $10 gift card to Starbucks or McDonalds or target. \n\nNo logo plates or coffee cups they’re going to cost you money and end up in the garbage that holiday weekend. \n\n\n\nThe most thoughtful thing you can do for people is usually kind of personal and unless your business is small enough to actually know things about them  then it will never be personal enough, and a small gift card or hoodie is probably the nicest thing you can do.",

While these methods can work, they often require a lot of manual effort. That’s where [WebIeadr](https://webleadr.pages.dev) comes in. A platform where web designers, developers, SEO specialists, and similar professionals can easily find and contact web design leads such as businesses without websites, in just a couple of clicks, along with many other features (check the website to explore all of them)!\n\nWebIeadr offers a one-time, credit-based system: **$12 for 100 business leads**. No subscriptions or recurring fees: pay only when needed. Credits stay in your account and can be used anytime, with options to buy more as needed. For example, if 40 out of 100 leads lack websites and 15 use third-party services (e.g., Facebook), and you secure just a mere 3 clients with basic sales skills, you could earn around $2,000. Your cost? Just $12\n\nThe bottom line is that WebIeadr offers an extremely quick and efficient solution to find web design leads in just a few clicks and **call them in just one click of a button**. From there, all you need to do is apply your sales skills to convince them that having a website is a worthwhile investment for their business.\n\nKnow a web designer, developer, or SEO specialist who could benefit from this? Please share this post with them. They’ll thank you later!",

I wanted to share something that might actually help people who are dealing with workplace leave issues, because I’ve spent 20+ years in the disability/ADA world and the amount of confusion, bad information, and unnecessary stress people face is wild. Most people only learn about FMLA, ADA, or short-term disability when they’re already overwhelmed, pregnancy complications, chronic illness, mental health issues, caring for a family member, etc. And then on top of that, employers and providers often give incomplete or incorrect guidance. I have seen the worst of the worst \n        . Doctors refusing to fill out paperwork\n\t•\tEmployers denying accommodations they should approve\n\t•\tPeople getting fired while on leave because they weren’t told their rights\n\t•\tPostpartum depression claims being mishandled\n\t•\tSTD claims delayed because the forms were filled out wrong\n\t•\tZero support for people navigating multiple overlapping systems\n\nI realized that most folks don’t need a lawyer they just need clear, accurate information and guidance\n\nSo I’m available for consultations and will walk with you side by side If you’re currently dealing with workplace leave issues and feeling stuck, confused, or stressed, you might find it helpful.\nPlease check me out at upendoinc.com",

I ended up with MANY orders at various stages with some started, some pending, and some I hadn’t even had a chance to look at yet.\n\nI had a sudden family situation came up, and with my full-time job and another side hustle, I just didn’t have the capacity anymore, so I decided to close for the season and only finish the orders I had already started. I made sure to notify everyone whose orders I hadn’t begun yet as soon as I had to make this decision.\n\nThere’s one situation that’s been weighing on  \n\nMy first customer - truly so sweet when we met - even shared my page to help me get started. With her permission, I had used a photo of her son in my listings (as this custom item included personal photos to create) to showcase my work. She put in a second, larger order but because of what was going on, I couldn’t get started on it and I had to notify her. I made sure in my message to sincerely apologize and again thanked her for her support.\n\nShe was REALLY upset. She asked me to remove all photos of her son (which I immediately did - but I did end up missing one which she then followed up asking me why it’s not taken down) she also unfollowed me, and didn’t once acknowledge what I could have been going through. She went straight to how she was disappointed and asked me take all the photos down and thanks for my honesty.\n\nI completely understand why she felt let down as she probably loved her first order and was excited to gift the next ones. It’s just that I hadn’t started her second order, she hadn’t paid yet, and I was stretched way beyond my capacity.\n\nHer reaction just hit harder than I expected, especially when I’m already overwhelmed. I never wanted to let anyone down, and I wish I could have explained more, but it’s a personal family matter. Now I’m feeling anxious about whether I should even try this again in the future.\n\nI’m not angry at her, I understand why she was disappointed. I’m just wondering if others think I handled this fairly, or if there’s something I could’ve done differently? I’m thinking this is probably just a customer is always right thing and I’m wrong but anyways would love to hear your thoughts.",

Few things customers hate more than cancelled orders. Maybe limit the number of orders you take at any time. It needs to be sustainable for you and you need to build in enough buffer to deal with unexpected / personal things coming up, as they always do.\n\nAlso don’t take orders without payment. Take payment at the time of the order and be sure to fulfill the order.",

From what OP wrote this client (she really is a client, one of the first orders and probably responsible for a lot of subsequent business) that she was disappointed that the order she placed is being cancelled. OP said she’s “REALLY” upset, but all she did was ask to take down the free marketing photos, said thank you for being honest, but that she was disappointed. That doesn’t sound like a crazy Karen. That sounds like someone who loved the product, told people about it so much that now she can’t have future orders she’s probably planning on for Christmas. This client probably told friends, and now she looks bad to her friends who may have placed orders as well. \n\nThis lady, one of the first clients, wasn’t in the wrong. OP messed up accepting too many orders, it happens. When a business makes a mistake the successful ones fix it. In this case the best option would have been stopping all order taking and getting done what was accepted. Next best option is what OP did, clear communication that the problem couldn’t be fixed. But OP needs to understand that the problem is not being fixed for any of those orders placed. I don’t see how whether they’ve paid or not yet makes any difference as the order was accepted. \n\nI do understand that this is a side hustle, but I think the client reacted reasonably to this very disappointing situation for her.",

People like to take their \"Screw the man\" mentality that they developed working for big soulless companies and treat everyone around them like that. I've been dealing with it since I started my own business and the best thing you can do for yourself is don't let the resentment ruin your relationships and do what you need to to protect yourself and your business. Put measures in place to prevent/reduce people stealing and doing other things to harm you, and focus on you and your's first and foremost. Very few people will take you needs and interests as seriously as you should and that includes family.\n\nNot trying to be overly jaded, but even family will happily turn you over to pad their own pockets and/or feelings.",

Get to focus on what you control and not care about the things you don’t.. I need to look for a product for a customer last week and seeing how other small businesses who sell online will basically give products away was pretty pretty depressing and these aren’t big businesses. These are small businesses that just don’t care about maintaining a margin and they just wanna make x amount of money per transaction.\n\nIt is what it is. I can’t lose sleep over  cause I can’t control what they sell their products.\n\nWhat kind of business do you have?",
