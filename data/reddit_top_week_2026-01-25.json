      "selftext": "Hey so I'm just another redditor like any of you, I could use the extra income so I've been hoping for side hustles but I can't really tell what to do.. I've been looking around and seen quite a few ideas and I'm mostly looking for something I can do online besides some nearby work like door dash etc.   \nSo I'm pretty shy overall as a person but I saw there's lots of different options I simply don't know exactly what to do or how? I saw that there was something like shopify and been trying that sort of but it's really confusing even with designs etc and even then I wouldn't be sure how to make use of it although its kind of set up haha. There's selling digital designs and again that's confusing.. I'm pretty shy and not too creative or artistic. I know there's feet finder and as a guy I don't really know if there's a market?   \nI just more so wanted some general help with a direction or advice or.. well, whatever you guys got!  \nthanks for sticking to the end and I'd appreciate any genuine ideas or advice, have a good one :)",

      "selftext": "Hi y'all,\n\nI currently run a few different side hustles that have consistent leads, that pays well only with high volume. I'd of course like to get into more skilled work, where I'll be able to make more in short bouts.\n\nUnfortunately, I realistically can’t take a job/apprenticeship right now to learn a trade, and I don’t have the capital to buy specialized equipment and hope it pays off. I’m a student with a car and can invest under $1,000.\n\nSo what I'm wondering is do any of you have any ideas, or similar stories? I know sometimes it's just worth it to bite off more than you can chew and learn as you go along.\n\nI'm thinking things like drywall repair, TV mounting, painting. All of which I have no experience with whatsoever. There is also things like house cleaning on the list, which I of course have some experience with, but maybe not enough to charge much for it.\n\nAnd as a P.S, I am okay with some ideas that might be well over $1,000. I do want to start things long into the future too, but would prefer some more accessible ideas so I can at least get closer to that capital.",

      "selftext": "First of all, I’m not in the US so pardon my grammar. Basically, I have a less than a year old youtube channel that's letting me enjoy a leisure life and travel around the world. Let me share how I did it for those who are in need of passive income too (like I was before). I will try to give abundant options of the tools as much as I can\n\nFor clarification, this isn't the usual guided meditation channel. The voiceover style is like one but the video is more like national geographic style, I talk about animals and connect it to the human experience in a meditative soothing style (You’ll learn why)\n\nGenerate your script using AI: Gemini/Chatgpt/Claude -  I am using these 3\n\nIt should be 1500-2000+ words so that it reaches more than 8 mins when narrated so you can place more ads\n\nAlso tell the ai that you want scene by scene direction of the script in a national geographic style \n\nCreate the voiceover. \n\nWhat I did was hire someone in Fiverr for $10 per voiceover. I have a long-term vo artist i found there whom I can tip often now because of my channel’s growth\n\nGo to fiverr and search “meditation voiceover” or something and find the cheapest with good reviews. TIP: YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE  EXPENSIVE ARTIST, the difference is negligible imo.\n\nYou can also try Elevenlabs but I found the first one cheaper because ai cannot do humanly breathing yet and it costs so much tokens just to get the tempo and feel I want + stress haha\n\nVideo direction is a must for monetization. Most meditation channels aren't monetized because they just use static images and no storytelling. I use Flow 4k or even the basic version to generate the animal clips. Any ai video generator is fine. I’ve also tried Haylo Labs before\n\nThen Capcut or cracked Adobe premiere for the editing (anything is fine) I don't recommend hiring someone since all you just need to do is drag the generated clips then add the voiceover. But if you really dont want the hassle you can also just hire $5 editing service in Fiverr\n\nVery important: Just make sure the video is 8 mins long or more\n\nDont stress on branding or anything, my channel didn't even have a banner until this year\n\nMy main audience is from the US on the older age side so rpm is above decent\n\n$1,000-$3,000 a month is already huge in my country so I’m happy about my progress. \n\nFeel free to drop your questions below",

I just hire someone from Fiverr (she offers $5 for 500 words if I remember correctly) which is way cheaper than ai.\n\nEdit: forgive me if i didnt drop her name earlier haha. Her name is Myrah O\n\nMore Edit:)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\n How do you stand out among other AI channels?\n\n- By not going full AI. Yes, I used AI for the scripts and videos but only because people don't focus on those when meditating. What matters more is the voice of my channnel. So I made sure that my voiceovers are really made by a HUMAN so that my audience can connect to my channel genuinely. \n\nBreakdown of cost?\n- Only $10 usually. Sometimes additional $5 for the video editing\n\n\nCan you help me start?\n- Yes I can, you can DM me but only if you're truly commited. I've been replying to a lot of DMS of people whom I can sense are not fully willing. I don't have an infinite time unfortunately. But what I have when starting out is patience and I'm fully willing to invest time and money\n\n\nSome scripts and videos we did for reference:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JpVvOvTK1JOLeTiiPi0vM6_1CDCadwBw?usp=sharing\n\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uXFwyKUBektxgq7YtVGNdinAs6TvL8Y1?usp=sharing\n\nJust ask me if you have any questions in DM. I'll try to reply to them as long as I can",

Even with a very generous CPM of $1 or so, that's around $2400 total earned.  Also total subscribers are 120k, which is like 1 subscriber for each 2 views, very unrealistic. \n\nOP also just posted a random screenshot of money spent instead of an actual earnings screenshot from YouTube. \n\nIn my opinion, this is a very well masked attempt to get his or his friends Fiverr VO profile to make more money, hoping that people from this thread will hire him/her. \n\nDo your due diligence people and don't believe anything you read online.\n\n(If the OP wants to refute my points, happy to hear from him)",

      "selftext": "Four months ago I saw those accounts reading AITA stories getting millions of views. I was like fuck it I'll try.\n\nFirst 10 videos were complete trash. Just my voice over text on screen. Maybe 300 views each. I was ready to delete the whole account.\n\nThen I noticed something. The accounts that were actually blowing up all had a person on screen. Not a real person, like some AI thing. I figured maybe that's what I was missing.\n\nStarted using ElevenLabs for voice cause I sound terrible on recordings. For the avatar I use APOB, edit everything in CapCut. Took forever to figure out but got something that works.\n\nFirst video with an actual face on screen got 4,800 views. I almost shit myself. Next one got 8,000. Then one randomly blew up to 35k and I thought I figured it out.\n\nI didn't figure it out.\n\nIt's been a couple months since then and I still have no idea what makes a video work. Some get 5k views. Some get 60k. One hit 240k and I tried to recreate it like 10 times. Nothing. The algorithm makes no sense.\n\nRight now I'm at:\n\n\\- 2-3 videos a day (used to do 4 but I was losing my mind)\n\n\\- 25k to 40k views per video on average but it's all over the place\n\n\\- 30-40 minutes per video, finding stories takes the longest\n\n\\- Making around $700/month total between TikTok and brand deals\n\nThe process is pretty simple. Find a story on Reddit, usually AITA cause those perform the best. Relationship advice is hit or miss. Edit it down cause people's attention span is like 5 seconds. Generate the voice, make the avatar talk, edit in CapCut, add subtitles cause nobody watches with sound apparently, post around 7pm.\n\nCosts:\n\nAPOB: $14/month\n\nElevenLabs: $22/month\n\nCapCut Pro: $10/month\n\nTotal: $46/month\n\nNot bad but it adds up.\n\nMost of my income comes from brand deals honestly. TikTok payments are inconsistent as hell. Some months it's $200, some months $400. Brand deals are more reliable, usually $300-400/month.\n\nHere's where I'm stuck.\n\nOne, I'm running out of good stories. I've gone through every top post on AITA from the last year. Now I'm scraping through random subreddits and most of it's garbage. Where do you even find good stories at this point? I tried confession and tifu but they don't hit the same.\n\nTwo, my views have been dropping for like 3 weeks straight. I don't know if TikTok changed something or people are just tired of this content. Some days I post 3 videos and they all die under 10k. It's frustrating as hell.\n\nThree, last week someone commented \"isn't this just stealing people's stories\" and now I can't stop thinking about it. I put credit in the description but I honestly don't know if that's enough. I've seen some accounts get taken down. Is this even legal? Like technically it's public content but I'm making money off it so I don't know.\n\nFour, the avatar looks weird sometimes. Especially the hands. I've had people call it out in comments. I don't know if I should try to fix it or just ignore it cause most people don't seem to care.\n\nOne video I did about this wedding drama where the bride uninvited her sister got 240k views. People were in the comments arguing for DAYS about who was wrong. That's when I realized controversy is everything. But I can't predict what's gonna be controversial.\n\nMy girlfriend thinks this whole thing is dumb but she can't argue with the extra $700 lmao.\n\nI want to keep doing this cause the money helps but I feel like I'm one algorithm change away from this whole thing disappearing.\n\nHas anyone else done something like this? How do you deal with views randomly dropping?\n\nAlso where do you find content when you've burned through the obvious stuff?\n\nAnd does anyone actually know the legal situation with using Reddit posts? I keep seeing different answers.\n\nI'm probably overthinking all of this but yeah. That's where I'm at.",

To your point that you give credit; there is no way for the writer of a reddit post to actually gain anything but upvotes (from the 1 out of 20 people who will actually look into that user) by simply tagging their username.  I'd have found it more insulting than anything tbh when my content was stolen if the creator actually admitted 'Yeah this random reddit user put in the work, but I am looking to make cash from it.'  \n\nWhy don't you try specific TV show subs, or r/fantheories and such?  \n\n&gt;TL;DR:    \n*Ppl love learning deep lore, or coherent theories on shows that they like.  I myself have watched many game of thrones videos which go into the finer points (which is why I should have realized I could have made money off of my content to begin with).  This may be an avenue which you could try, though it may be saturated already with all the low hanging fruit already harvested.*  \n\nI wrote a long post about a Dexter theory on there a few years back, spent hours reviewing episodes for relevant quotes and everything.  It got a lot of attention with almost a thousand upvotes, and sat at a 99% upvote ratio.  I only did it to kill time and do something I like to do; write long posts for ppl to engage with.  \n\nIt came to my attention after that someone had taken some of those clips from the show, and basically narrated the video verbatim from my post.  My post was clearly the inspiration for the video, and they used huge chunks of my writing in their narration.  This video was at like over a million views by the time I saw it.  I felt robbed and used.  \n\nGranted, if I were smarter, I guess I should have just made the video myself to begin with.  I wasn't thinking about money though, just providing interesting content on reddit.  To this day I am resentful that some asshole basically took my content and made money off of it; what kinda pisses me off more though is how low effort that was.  (Yes, editing a video takes skill and time, but once the actual creative thinking part is done for you it's not hard to turn it into \"revenue\".  \n\nI spent a lot of effort to make that post, expecting nothing in return except maybe some agreement/discussion of my theory.  This guy, just copy pasted my shit, cut some clips up and turned my efforts into his money in probably less time than I used editing the grammar through drafts of my post.  It feels shitty to be on that end.  Though again, it's my fault for not having the foresight to know it'd be stolen, and not trying and monetize my efforts to begin with I suppose.  \n\nAfter I watched the video, I started getting a ton of recommendations for similar videos which present theories on TV lore, most of which had millions of views.  So if you are going to do this, I suppose that's an angle to try to pursue as well; though it's already saturated.  To avoid repeating other videos; maybe start digging into the lore of newer TV shows rather than ones that have been speculated on for a decade already.  \n\n&gt;*You seem to be mindful of the \"stealing\" aspect of all this, so I am simply giving you a point of view from someone who has been stolen from in this way.  At the end of the day, again I should have known it would happen regardless and either have done the video myself or not even bothered to post the thread.  I can't really be mad that someone saw a chance I did not to make money from something I put out for free, but yet I am resentful.*",

I got into drones about 2 years ago just for fun, mostly filming my weekend hikes and local spots around Portland. Posted some clips on instagram and this small real estate agency hit me up asking if they could use one of my neighborhood shots for a listing. I said sure and charged them like $50 thinking that was fair\n\nfast forward and now i have 6 local businesses (3 realtors, a wedding venue, and 2 small hotels) that have me on retainer for $150-300/month each. Theyre basically paying for access to my footage library that i keep updating. I spend maybe 4-5 hours a month flying around getting new stuff and the rest is just them downloading whatever they need from the shared drive I set up\n\nthe best part is i was gonna do this hobby anyway. I had some money saved up from Stakе for a better drone and just reinvested the first payments into upgrading my equipment instead. now its covering itself plus giving me around $1200-1400 extra monthly without much effort",

Game changer was looking at what people searched for on Etsy and Pinterest.\n\nWhat worked:\n\nBundles sell way better than single products. A $27 bundle moves faster than a $7 template even though they take the same time to make.\n\nEtsy SEO isn’t optional. Boring but necessary if you want to be found.\n\nQuality over quantity. 10 good products beat 50 mediocre ones.\n\nWhat didn’t work:\n\nPinterest ads (wasted $200), daily Instagram posting (low conversions), lowering prices (attracts problem customers).\n\nNovember breakdown: $1,840 Etsy, $780 Gumroad, $420 Creative Market.\n\nStill takes about 10 hours a week for customer service and new uploads. Not truly passive but beats a 9-5.\n\n​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

But I’m trying to look at it from a user’s perspective. Do people actually go to Gumroad and search for things, or is it mostly your job as the creator to bring in the traffic?\n\nI’m not saying this to be lazy I’m just genuinely curious.

The kids were great. The parents were...not.\n\n2. Asked everybody I knew if they had any potential jobs or work they needed done. I ended up with a weird mishmash of housecleaning, lawnmowing, babysitting, in-home computer repair and setup, bookkeeping, ghostwriting, and package shipping jobs. The package shipping ended up being pretty great--it was for a lab that sent out test kits. Ghostwriting also brought in some decent money.\n\n3. Started an eBay store selling jewelry and accessories. That brought in $2,000-4,000/month after a few months. I started it with about $500.\n\n4. Wrote and self-published books. That brought in over $100K one year, but it wasn't consistent. I'm trying to replicate that again now that I no longer have a corporate job and have more time.\n\n5. Got hired by a content mill. I wrote 10,000 words a week for them in SEO-optimized articles. It was a grind but paid my adult daughter's medical bills.\n\n6. Started a plant nursery on my property 10 years back as a side hustle. It currently brings in $25K in April-May. I'm expanding to farmer's markets and online sales this year.\n\nPretty much what I did each time is take stock of my skills, no matter how trivial, and see if people would pay for them. I also factored in what I love/hate and that ultimately led me to writing and selling plants. But along the way, I did a lot of less enjoyable stuff. I actually enjoyed housecleaning and other physical work, but I kind of hated dealing with people in their homes. Now I deal with people on my property, but hanging with plant people outside is very enjoyable to me.",

          "body": "Sorry for your loss. I will tell you what I did when I was dirt poor. One day, probably by fate, I came upon a dumpster. It was not an ordinary dumpster, it was an Ul-ta dumpster. Back in 2013, dumpster diving had not caught fire on Youtube yet, so many corporate stores did not take precautions. I walked up to a dumpster that had several thousand dollar's worth of discontinued hair sprays. I sold most of them quickly for up to 50 dollars a pop. Seems like I scored near 50 of them. They sold rapidly, because the product had recently been discontinued. And this is also a lesson, if you can source discontinued cosmetic items that people still want, they have high demand and you can make bank. An example of this today is Nautica Competition cologne. Many of us have a bottle or two sitting in an attic from the 90's. They discontinued them and they sale good even today if still fresh. But anyways, dumpster diving is a great way to begin selling on eBay. Just make sure everything is clean and nothing is broken. Always be careful and look for hazardous waste, needles, etc. It is a gray area, so try not to get caught or you could be trespassed. But say if you were a security guard or maintenance worker at a mall overnights, with no one around, you could probably score lots of things to resell while making a normal job paycheck as well, and it would not be trespassing then. I remember I also found tons of Vic Secret NWT lingerie items that had been returned. The store was supposed to cut them up and toss them, but never did. I made thousands on that dumpster as well. And while I am on memory lane, there was a Sports store that tossed 100's of shelf pull baseball hats and trinkets that I sold, and also a Williams Sonoma store that tossed new steel frying pans, cooking machines, and I even scored something like 20 new in can recently expired gourmet coffee beans from them, and also a new with tags Japanese Santoku knife I sold for over 100 dollars. Those were the good ole days for me, which began my passion for treasure hunting.",

But if you build the right type of business and asset then it can be mostly passive over the long haul. \n\nExample:\n\nI spent months putting together my Tiny Newsletter System to share my unique way of writing email newsletters. That took a lot of hours, mental energy, writing, revising, creating graphics, the landing page, etc.\n\nBut now, I just focus on managing the Facebook ads to promote it. And slowly fine tune the audience target, ad copy and Gumroad landing page to increase conversions. \n\nIt’s not 100% passive, but now that I have the initial asset built it’s much less involved time wise. \n\nI suggest you build a Minimal Viability Product (MVP), build a landing page, and run Facebook ads to it to test market demand. If you get interest, then keep going and fine tune. If not, pivot to s new idea.",

There are definitely some glaring issues, but I'll continue bug fixing as I go along.\n\nOne interesting thing I noticed is that the bot actually takes less trades &amp; i think its due to the lack of that human element. The bot doesn't get those \"gut feelings\" it sticks strictly to its data &amp; parameters. This isn't a bad thing, but there were a few instances the bot ignored while adhering to parameters, that I would have jumped at.\n\nI'm not sure I can code \"emotion\" on the bot &amp; I think doing so may ruin its edge. This is all ramble anyway as I don't have nearly enough data to make a conclusion. Maybe I'll do another update in 3 months to determine idk.\n\nOn my last post there were some of you who asked how I built it, mine is custom coded, but I did say I'll try to find a no code alternative for you guys.\n\nI did find one &amp; took the liberty to try to build out as much of the workflow as I could. Before I dive into it let me just say that if you really want to make custom workflows, learn to code. It was actually harder ( for me ) to build this cause these no code editors have quite a few constraints you don't get coding.\n\n[Regardless here is the workflow](https://www.gumloop.com/pipeline?workbook_id=fn8cXAevPdxcJLPoMyuTfy). I forgot to add a trigger, but in my defense the entire thing was pissing me off so i could focus. ( don't bully me please )\n\nDO NOT under any circumstance use the stupid Ai chat builder thing, i think gummie is the name. It will break the entire workflow. You are better off experimenting &amp; trying different things yourself. Also I'm sharing this workflow as I'm sure one of y'all can improve it &amp; make it infinitely better than I can.  \n  \nHopefully I've covered everything, if not, if I make an update to the update then I'll cover anything I may have left out. As usual feel free to ask any questions. ",

Surveys are flexible and you can start immediately. I use a bunch of different ones and make around $300/month, not enough to live on but it's something while you figure out a bigger plan.\n\nIf you want actual sustainable income, you kinda need to pick a skill and get good at it. Freelance writing, video editing, web development, graphic design, whatever. Then use Upwork or Fiverr to find clients. But that takes months to build up to livable income. The people making real money online either spent years building it or had capital to invest upfront. Just being real with you so you don't waste time chasing get rich quick stuff.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone thought i would do a little AMA. I’ve been making my living online for well over 25 years and just thought I’d give some time to answer any questions you have about the topics I’m familiar with. \n\nI have multiple passive online incomes from websites like travel blogs to social media sites, to AI Youtube channels. \n\nMy social media site basically runs on auto pilot there’s plenty of members who have been on the site long enough for me to give them privileges to ban people who try to abuse the site with spam or whatever. The site makes revenue off premium memberships. You can pay $10 a month to access more features. \n\nMy travel sites and other informational websites did take years to build but it pays off at the end, even small tourist towns travel guides sites get 50k-100k views a month and they tend to get high RPM around $6. But that’s only $300-$600 a month so you can’t live off just one site. I target what’s called “evergreen” content basically meaning content that’s always going to be useful. Unlike content that needs to be updated everyday. \n\nI have a software website that i developed automation software for repetitive tasks for an example scraping tools etc. The software is subscription based on average $10 a month to $99 a month. This is basically passive besides updating or improving the software from time to time. No advertising just ranking on google for keywords. \n\nI have a YouTube channel that I use AI to make videos, currently gets about 10 million views a week with 85k subscribers it’s not exactly passive income though because I believe soon as I stop posting the views will drop…. I literally make the videos while on the toilet most the time while most people scroll the videos on the toilet I’m making them so I’ll call that passive LOL. \n\nI have a 3D printing eBay business this is passive but you need a wife who ships the products but long as you have that, get a 3D scanner and a printer and start scanning everything we sell a lot of replacement parts for everything from your cars cup holder to your ovens knobs to toys. You also can make this completely passive with some print on demand sites I’ve heard but never tried. We don’t make enough profit off each sale so I don’t think a middle man service would work for us but it could for your products. \n\nBut anyways free to ask away and maybe I can answer some questions.

      "selftext": "I just wanted to tell you about a small side job that works for me. There are no complicated systems in this simple setup that is based on useful content and affiliate links.\n\nI run a small travel guide in my area. Not much. Mostly useful information: how to get to the airport/where to sleep/trips for the day or things that help you save time, money, and nerves.\n\nI also write articles for other travel blogs and guides. Sometimes I do this as a guest post, sometimes I get paid, and other times I do it just to get links back to my own site.\n\n\n\nHow I make money from it?\n\nMostly through affiliate links, but only to things that people need when they travel.\n\n**The platforms I use are (it's not affiliate links):**\n\nKiwitaxi: transfers to and from the airport and city, their affiliate program here [https://kiwitaxi.com/en/influencer/](https://kiwitaxi.com/en/influencer/) \n\nFor example, someone once ordered a transfer worth almost €1000, and I got more than €100 from it.\n\nAiralo eSIM [https://www.airalo.com/partner-with-us/affiliate-partner](https://www.airalo.com/partner-with-us/affiliate-partner)  \nthis one is especially useful\n\nTravelpayouts is basically a big affiliate hub for travel with a lot of travel brands.\n\nI dont use banners, no pushy calls to action. Only links that make sense in context in guides or on social media. I think that when users are already ready to buy a service, they start looking for promo codes. They don’t necessarily read my small blog - they find a promo code instead, and I still get a commission even without being a big blogger.\n\n\n\nReal numbers.\n\nIncome isn't steady:\n\nMonths with little business: €50-80. Good months: €100-400\n\nWhen do good months usually come around? When an article does well on Google and ranks well for relevant search queries.\n\nOr during the busy time. When someone makes plans for a trip ahead of time and then books it. That's the good part- some bookings don't happen until weeks after the click.\n\nWhat I like is that it works long-term: you write something once, and it can keep bringing in commissions.",

Helpful content attracts attention without spending a dime.\n\n2. **Reddit &amp; Forums** – If you’re just starting, join subreddits in your niche and relevant forums. **Add a link to your social profile first to avoid being banned.** Focus on solving real problems, then naturally mention or link your product once you’ve built trust.\n\n3. **Free Blogging Platforms** – Use Medium, WordPress, or Blogger to write guides that target keywords people search for. Google traffic is free and evergreen.\n\n4. **Discord &amp; Facebook Communities** – Participate in niche communities. Build relationships, answer questions, and subtly share your product when it fits.\n\n5. **Email Lists from Free Tools** – Start a simple newsletter with free tools like MailerLite. Offer tips, updates, or freebies related to your product.\n\n6. **Collaborate With Micro-Influencers** – Micro-creators with small followings often share content for free or in exchange for your product.\n\n7. **YouTube Tutorials &amp; Shorts** – Record short “how-to” videos or tips related to your product. Video content is one of the best free traffic sources in 2026.\n\n8. **SEO Optimization for Free Traffic** – Create guides, tutorials, or FAQs targeting keywords your audience searches for. Even a small blog can rank and bring consistent traffic.\n\n**Key Tip:** Focus on helping people first. Promotion works best when your content actually solves problems. One hour a day can grow into serious passive income over time.",

      "selftext": "When I first started looking into online marketing, I was honestly just trying to escape the 9–5. I didn’t really know who was legit and who wasn’t—I just knew I wanted out.\n\nI invested in a course that focused heavily on mindset and taught the basics of building a website. It even came with its own software as part of the package. On the surface, everything sounded solid: build a site, add products, and send traffic to it.\n\nWhere things started to feel unclear was the traffic part. The guidance was basically: post on social media, promote your links, and choose between organic traffic (slow but free) or paid traffic (faster but costs money). There wasn’t much strategy beyond that.\n\nI struggled because I didn’t fully understand how traffic actually works. Organic felt painfully slow, paid traffic felt risky, and I kept bouncing between different marketers hoping someone would explain it in a way that finally clicked.\n\nWhat I eventually learned is that traffic is the business. Websites, tools, and products don’t matter much if you don’t understand how to consistently get attention from real people. Once I stopped chasing platforms and started learning how each traffic source actually behaves, things made more sense.\n\nSharing this for anyone early in the process: confusion doesn’t mean you’re failing—it usually means you haven’t been taught the full picture yet.\n\nCurious what part of online marketing was hardest for others when they first started—traffic, mindset, or execution?",

But the thing that got me was how many other older people in her neighborhood were in the same boat but had no one to help them.\n\nThese weren't your typical \"hire a junk removal service\" situations. These folks needed someone patient who understood that every item has a story and you cant just toss everything. They also needed help deciding what actually has value vs what doesn't, how to sell stuff on facebook marketplace (most of them have no clue), and someone to physically do the heavy lifting.\n\nStarted offering this super specific service in my area. \"Downsizing assistance for seniors\" basically. I help them sort, list valuable items online, coordinate donations, and handle the actual cleanout. Charged $35/hour which felt fair and I had a little money saved up from Stakе so I could test it without stressing about immediate income.\n\nFirst client came from my moms friend. Then word of mouth exploded because apparently every boomer in a 10 mile radius is dealing with this. Now I'm booked 3 weeks out and averaging around $4k/month working maybe 20 hours a week. The crazy part is how many of their kids are willing to pay me to do this because they either live far away or dont have the patience.\n\nIm wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?",

When I sold my Grandma's house in 2016, I went down there for a week and loaded up a trailer with the valuable items or things I thought I'd use at home. The rest of the house was evacuated by a team of some 5 laborers who bagged/boxed up clothes, linens, books, etc and brought them to their warehouse. It took them maybe half a day to tie up loose ends. From there, the business model was simple. Once a month, this business would hold a public auction that went from like 7am till 9pm. Lots of similar items from different estates would be placed in this enormous warehouse/outdoor space and people would come through and make offers on items (or just buy outright for a fixed price). Throughout the day, at different time checkpoints, the price would be reduced by 25% until the last few hours of the day it would be 75% off. At the end of the day, all unsold goods were landfilled or donated. \n\nIn terms of making money, the contract was set up where I owed the company $1,000 no matter what and 25% of net revenue of sold goods. They ended up getting around $3,000 for the miscellanea of her house so I only owed $250 above what they got from the sale. They also set me up with a contractor/realtor to get the house minimally ready for sale.\n\nI'm not saying you need to scale it that large, but that's how that company was able to provide families with some peace of mind that the entire house wasn't just going in the trash.",

You operate in a unique space of being able to come from outside and handle the downsizing/listing of items. For example, if you, a stranger/expert come and tell them that this item should be listed and is worth ~$20, they might accept your word for it while if their son or daughter comes and says the same thing, they might argue and tell them they're wrong. \n\nI deal with the same thing with my family all the time. I did my degree in computer science and economics. I work in tech. My parents are academics (researchers at a uni). They will argue with me till they're blue in the face about systems I've literally worked on because I'll always be their son and kid in their head, but if one of my colleagues said the same thing as me, they'd accept it as expert testimony.\n\n&gt; Im wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?\n\nI mean, it's a specialist version but you have a lot of parallels. You should think about what exactly makes up the core parts of your profession and how it differs from other similar, overlapping industry professions. From there, you can figure out a)where to hire from, b) how to hire, c) what needs to be taught, and d) how you continue to refine that niche. It can totally scale. (and as others have said, $35 an hour is less than what I pay just for regular cleaning ladies to come dust my place every week lol. You also have to keep in mind if you take outside help, your prices need to scale so you make your cut and can also handle other things like equipment, liability, etc.. At least in LA, I pay $50 an hour pp (e.g. $200 for 2 hours with a crew of 2) and that feels fairly standard/not the lowest budget but certainly not high end. So yeah, $35 for specialist help?

Do it!\n\nMight want to get a contract drawn up by a lawyer.\n\n\n\nMaybe something here is helpful:\n\nI once bought stuff from an auction company that specialized in downsizing homes of people who either passed away or moved into assisted living or something similar.\n\nPeople had access to the website and when the auction went live you could look at each lot (set of goods) and put a bid in, like eBay.\n\nAs an example: they'd put all of the \"Sports Stuff\" (two tennis rackets, a soccer ball, old glove, and a tennis ball) on a table and take a photo for the website. \n\nSometimes there'd be \"Sports Stuff 2\" as a lot name if there are too many similar objects. \n\nOther examples: cleaning supplies, books, collectables, dishes, trophies, whatever they have.\n\n\nThe pickup date was set before the Auction began. Credit card saved for processing and if you bid and won, it was yours.\n\nIf I recall correctly, you had to agree that you could pick up the goods on the specified pickup date during a set of hours. This allowed the company to arrange all pick ups of goods from the house on one single day. They'd only have to worry about what didn't sell.\n\nIf a customer didn't make it to pickup between the set hours on the pickup date, the goods went to second place in the auction for an arranged day, and you were charged anyway.\n\nI think each lot had an easy minimum set, like that Sports Stuff example would start at like $6.\n\nWas pretty awesome.",

If that bothers you (I know the feel), grandfather in the people who your current clients refer to you after the rate change, or grant those referrals a reduced rate special for the first X hours or something.\n\nScaling something like that is tricky. The reason you're so successful, and distinguishing yourself from what's out there, is your emotional intelligence and empathy. That can be recruited, but not really realistically taught on an employee-training timeline. I wouldn't try to make this a big company with many agents or anything like that.\n\nThat said, with careful consideration and selection, you could probably justify expanding to a very small team, and perhaps dividing up labor would be efficient as well, like having someone to list things for sale, someone else to do hauling with a truck, whatever of that nature comes to mind for you based on your operation. Or each person could just take on the full scope of services, and the team just divides up clients. You have lots of cool options for helping people in your area, hooking up one or two or a few other people with a good job, and making your business easier on yourself. But yeah, I think if you try to expand very far beyond a smallish company in your particular city/region, it would probably succeed, but probably also lose a lot of the real core value being provided (that being the compassionate shepherding of people through a difficult life transition).

      "selftext": "Hi everyone. Please excuse any mistakes; English isn't my first language.\n\nI've been learning Python on my own for a few months now (i recently finished CS50P). My dad told me to stop programming simple games and create something useful, so i took his advice.\n\nI contacted a local clothing brand that was having trouble with their catalog photos. They wanted professional-looking photos of models but didn't have the budget for a photoshoot.\n\nWhat i built:\n\nI wrote a Python script that takes the flat images of their products and runs them through an AI workflow (generating variations, scaling to 4K, removing watermarks). It took me about two weeks of trial and error. \\*\\*The result:\\*\\*\n\nThe owner was stunned. He paid me $500 USD instantly. In my country, for a 16-year-old, that's a life-changing amount of money.\n\n\\*\\*The problem (i need advice):\\*\\*\n\nThe owner now wants to pay me a monthly salary to automate other \"boring\" parts of his business. He mentioned things like:\n\n\\- Formatting messy Excel inventory files.\n\n\\- Automating basic SEO tasks.\n\n\\- Logistics data entry.\n\nI said yes, but honestly, I'm scared. i know basic Python, but I've never handled \"mission-critical\" business data before. My questions for experienced entrepreneurs:\n\n1. Is it a bad idea to accept an advance when I'm still learning?\n2. For those automating businesses: What are the safest and lowest-risk automations\n\ni\n\n1. should propose first so\n\ni\n\n1. don't accidentally ruin their business?\n2. How do you deal with \"imposter syndrome\"? I feel like I got lucky with the first question.\n\nThanks for reading.",

Any issues will then be localised to your own machine. You're only flipping bits at the end of the day.\n\nI think you are experiencing imposter syndrome because you suddenly feel that you are responsible for much more than you are. You were paid $500 for a script, job done. Now they will ask you ad-hoc to create other scripts for them. That's it. Their business doesn't rely on you and if it does that's their problem. You are just 1 kid who can script a bit. Remember to ask for help if you need it, from the business and others.\n\nGood luck!",

So just get stuck in\n\n\nIts not about us telling you what to do; we don't know. The best software teams will walk into a new environment and not touch a thing ... they'll observe, have meetings and talk to the stakeholders and find out. This is what you need to do.\n\n\nNormally people will already know what they want and explain solutions to you, you'll just need to work out the priority and how to fix the issue.\n\n\nIf the issue is too big or overwhelming, split it into smaller deliverable milestones and communicate those stages to the boss or stakeholder.\n\n\nTo comment on a few things, is is not a bad thing to accept an advance ... you learning is not a problem, ALL devs are learning including old boys like me. The only issue about the advance is that its too small, so remember to stick to a daily rate yhat is fair and agree wages/invoices before work starts.\n\n\nWhat are the safest and low risk automations? Stay away from payroll and critical systems ... judge and highlight risk. Everything can be risky, but you just need to think about delivering it in a safe way... training staff well, running things in parallel, have periods of user acceptance testing, roll software out to small groups or individuals and the others continue to use existing methods.\n\n\nThe key is to identify the parts of the business that need to be improved, change them in order of priority and roll them out intelligently while keeping people informed of different milestones\n\n\nHope that helps!",

      "selftext": "Started flipping luxury watches about a year and half ago. I started with 25k of my own capital from my day job. Eventually I put in up to about \\~70k of my own funds (owners capital) to grow the business. I started with no funding, no mentor, no one in the business and no courses. Lost 2k on my first 2 watches in 2024. Lost another 8k later that year. I mostly sell Rolexes and luxury brands. Nothing under 1k. Average watch price is around 10k.\n\n2024 - First 6 months:\n\n\\- 561k in sales\n\n\\- 22k gross profit\n\n\\- 13k net profit\n\n2025 - One year:\n\n\\- 1.2m in sales\n\n\\- 87k gross profit\n\n\\- 63k net profit\n\n\\- \\~8k payroll (salary to myself)\n\nIve been wholesaling pretty much everything. Fast flips. I aim for 6-12% margins, depending on how long I’m holding a watch. I’ve lost a few times, can count on one hand probably. I’m trying to get to a point where I’m making a consistent 10k / month net, after all expenses including my salary of 1k / month.\n\nI do some social media / marketing but very little. Trying to really focus on that this year so I can sell to more retail clients for a healthier margin. As well as buy more watches from retail clients.\n\nIt’s been really fun and I love watches and enjoy getting to wear them while I try to sell them. I still have my day job and don’t think I’m going to quit anytime soon.\n\nJust wanted to share this. If I missed anything or any questions just ask below. I’m going to try to post regular updates to track my progress and engage with others as I have never done it before. \n\nThanks!",

Faster, clean decisions with imperfect info often beat waiting for the perfect price. I think that’s a big part of why you’re hitting consistent volume now.\n\n\nCurious, do you ever formalize that into a rule?

That asking for support means you're not a real entrepreneur” is wrong. Entrepreneurs use every available resource they can find, paid or unpaid, to help them achieve their goals. They create solutions, they solve problems, they ask for help. They take the risk, and the responsibility, of failure. \n\nUntil you’ve signed the front of a paycheck, instead of endorsing the back, you’ll not understand the pressure.

          "body": "I'm curious what you'd like to see happen instead.\n\nSo I totally understand that often people say solo, but there's a lot going on behind the scenes, so it can be a bit misleading when people say that.\n\nI think a lot of people do oversell success and undersell support/time/effort it took to get there as a way to make their success seem bigger. In particular ignoring early family investment, or initial connections that lead to first sales. This is not healthy (for future entrepreneurs; for society, I don't know) to create an image of entrepreneurship that is too far from reality. It's like filters on instagram and what it does to beauty standards.\n\nBut if you are trying to say that society should take credit for the achievements of the individual, or parents should take credit.. I think that pushes it too far.\n\nWe absolutely should recognize the people in our lives that supported us on our journey, and that (depending where you live) that a stable structure around you was helpful, but support does not mean doing the work and actually taking the risk.\n\nThere have always been entrepreneurs, in every kind of society, so that can be omitted by default - it's not helpful and not actually a form of modesty.\n\nEven when absolutely NOT solo, very often it's 1 person that was the main force behind success. I had no family investment or support, am not married, and had no connections for my business. I put in my life savings. I did bring on some people to share the work over the years, but none invested their life savings, and all eventually gave up while I kept going. Now I'm doing pretty well. Did they help? Yes. But did they bear the same burden I did? Not even close. I personally wouldn't sell this as a solo founder journey though (although my next startup I will).\n\nBut I have a feeling this is not about entrepreneurs that built real businesses, but more about people selling snake-oil style courses?\n\nI imagine most will agree that it's annoying and likely a general bad for society. But it will always be here. Maybe you can invent some software that can help consumers make better decisions.",

Two people can have the same resources, but only one might put in the sweat, iteration, and discipline needed to move an idea forward.\n\n\nI think the record should show both elements: acknowledge the support that made a thing possible AND the individual choices that drove it over the finish line.\n\n\nCurious, for people here who do talk about having built something “alone,” what do you think that phrase is trying to communicate?

You’re entitled to that self-view, of course, but it doesn’t mean you’ve achieved moral superiority or more inherent value than someone working in a factory. Even when it’s 100% true and nobody has ever helped you - what good does it serve you to say it or identify with it?

I could definitely see some value in that. To me, it seems more rooted in identity which is all a game we play, alone, in our heads. I’ve met pompous entrepreneurs and incredible, inspiring entrepreneurs - I don’t think this did-it-alone-mindset produced the successful ones, but a lot of the community here seems pretty defensive of it and attached to it.

For example, if you have an assistant, a bookkeeper, an accountant, someone baby sitting your kids, any type of help, I don’t consider that self made. Did you know that majority of new business have to close down because of health insurance? Having good health insurance as self employed is necessary. \nIf you have a partner that takes care of the household, that is help. If you can afford to outsource, that is no longer self made. \nIf you can work 100 plus hours on your business, your entrepreneurship journey, how do you have time to do anything else?\nHave you tried working on a business while still trying to maintain a part time or full time job and have to take care of a household all on your own? The problem is, everyone tells you, you just have to work all day and night, just focus on your business. \nBut they never tell you the help they had. We are not made to make every decision on our own. I have a great example of a guy I knew that, even though he had a great support system that put him to the peak of his success, everything started crashing down when he stopped using his support system. \nIf you do not have a good support system, having no support system is better than a bad one. \nI’ve learned that trying to manage everything myself, I can’t do it alone. Now I’m learning how to outsource. I wish a “self made” entrepreneur would point this out in very simple words. \nThere is no such thing as self made. You can come up with an idea on your own, but the execution might not be great on your own. And if you want to grow your business, okay you’re saving money by doing it on your own, but time is money. I rather outsource than spend way too much time on something that I can pay someone to do it better than I can.",

I have some money saved up, so I wasn’t risking rent or groceries, which made me feel like I was being “responsible” about it.\n\nWhat I didn’t expect was how much mental energy it would take. Every decision feels heavier than it should. Pricing, timing, whether I should launch now or wait, whether I’m overthinking or underthinking. I’ll make a choice, feel okay about it for a few hours, then start questioning if it was the wrong move.  \nThere are nights where I’m sitting on the couch playing on myprize, not even working, but my brain is still stuck on the business. Wondering if I should’ve done something differently that day, or if I’m already messing it up without realizing it. It’s not burnout exactly, more like this constant low-level pressure. The funny part is, when I talk to friends, they think it’s exciting. And it is, sometimes. But a lot of it just feels lonely and uncertain in a way I didn’t really anticipate. There’s no one to tell you “yes, this is correct” or “no, that’s a bad idea.”\n\nFor those of you who’ve been doing this longer, does that part ever get quieter or do you just get better at living with the uncertainty and trusting your own decisions?",

You learn from failures and learn even more from successes (success is where you get patterns you know work, and can now remix those patterns to the next thing).\n2. You learn how to make the chaos transform into insight and actual information about the product and businesses you are building. You learn things like pretotyping, lean startup, Osterwalder’s 3 fits, MVP, and a wealth of other ways to reduce your risk and accelerate your learning. And maybe most of all you learn that there’s this thing called the customer. Wonderful source of insight and knowledge on what works, what they are willing to pay for and how. Much of chaos goes away when you go to the customer with decisions you would need to make, and get their input on the choices. Or just use design thinking as a strategy: really listen to the customer, empathize with their situation, and learn heavy from it. Learn to ask questions like: “I have a legally binding purchase order here for my product, it’s 75,000$ would you sign it right now?” And when they don’t sign it, asking “what would it need to have to for you to sign it right now?” And then you listen very carefully what follows.\n\nThere’s even a literal science to this.

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’d really appreciate some perspective from founders or people who’ve been through co-founder conflicts.\n\nI’m a technical co-founder (CTO) of a small Swiss startup (GmbH). I built and maintain essentially the entire product, run infrastructure, fix bugs, and handle most customer support. My two co-founders focus on business and sales.\n\nEquity is split 40% / 40% / 20% (me). Originally it was meant to be equal, but it changed at incorporation due to capital contribution issues. I also don’t have sole signature rights.\n\nOver the last months, they:\n\n\\- Excluded me from business meetings\n\n\\- Started discussing decisions privately\n\n\\- Reduced communication\n\n\\- Admitted later they “distanced themselves”\n\nThen they began blaming me for:\n\n\\- Not being involved enough\n\n\\- Not asking about meetings I was excluded from\n\n\\- “Acting like an employee” because I mainly do technical work\n\n\\- Not doing business/sales/networking (which was never my role)\n\nNow one of them gave me an ultimatum:\n\n1. Become an employee and give up founder equity\n2. Leave completely\n\nThey refused my proposal to align expectations or do a measurable performance plan.\n\nThey also said things like:\n\n\\- “We can’t have someone who does nothing and bunkers equity.”\n\n\\- “This is just derisking for us.”\n\n\\- “It’s too late to fix things because there is now distance.”\n\nWe do have a co-founders’ agreement that says:\n\n\\- Equity reflects long-term contribution\n\n\\- Performance issues should go through a written improvement plan with a cure period\n\n\\- Disputes should go through negotiation -&gt; mediation -&gt; arbitration\n\n\\- Vested equity can’t be forced to transfer (5% vested)\n\n\\- Role or equity changes need unanimous consent\n\nThey skipped all of that and went straight to an ultimatum.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\\- Is this a normal “professionalization” move or a co-founder squeeze-out?\n\n\\- Do I actually have leverage here, or will majority control win anyway?\n\n\\- Should I refuse both options and force mediation / legal process?\n\n\\- Is accepting employee status a bad idea long-term?\n\nThanks for any advice.",

Even a warm phone call, a personal visit, shared routines become the memories that actually last.  \nChasing success for them is beautiful, but don't turn love into a deadline. if they raise someone this driven and this caring, you have already given them proof they disn't fail.\n\nI was in similar boat a while ago, but my oldman gave this advice, and my wife validated the same, now we are in happy space.",

One of the purest motivations is the desire to repay those who have sacrificed for you.  \nHowever, don't wait until you \"make it\" to spend time with them or express your concern. Success isn't only about the major event; it's also about the small things that happen along the route. Give them a call, stop by when you can, and show them that you're trying. That still has significance now.  \nYou already stand out since it's obvious that you don't take things for granted. Continue, but while you're constructing, remember to live in the moment with them.

      "selftext": "I have been working in AI/Data Science and startups since 2003 and for the last couple of years I can see the shift is coming, and it is both exciting and very bothering. Just like in 2008 I see there is this combination of loss of jobs and new startups launched, and this is expectable. In the next couple of years it will only speed up, we will see more solo founders, more people trying to launch a business, and more failure stories. What's different is the scale of making new things: it's so easy now to launch something small, not very data-savvy, and of course it needs AI in it.\n\nOversaturation is coming our way with a crazy speed, many founders price their services cheaper and cheaper, and we all know where it leads. Someone sees it works, repeats, sets the price lower.. It's like a downward spiral we are rapidly moving into.\n\nJust in the last couple of months I heard founders pith one and the same idea in different variations about 10+times, it starts looking like a \"Groundhog Day\" of ideas!\n\n  \nI am very excited about physical products and unsexy startups I'm advising, since at least they have a better chance to stay afloat. Especially devices, robotics, everything linked to meds / personal care, or even food. These have a better chance of a successful exit.\n\nJust Friday thoughts of an elderly person, would be glad to see what are your observations.",

I am more inclined to offer a discount to a long term client, not someone who this is my first interaction with.\n\nThere are times when taking a small hit are worth it, mostly if the prestige of having this client, or being able to use them as a powerful reference, is something you can leverage to get more business.  Offering a discount if you can showcase the work you do with them to other clients as part of your marketing might make it worthwhile.  Obviously, depends on the business.\n\nThat said, if they come in promising to pay more later, that's a pretty big red flag.  I very likely would also walk away.  Even if they could bring you in steady work in the future, they likely will always push to give you minimal margins, so you'll be working a lot for them, but not really profiting.  Again, depends on the type of business if this is worth it or not.",

Engineering probably has changed the most but here are some use cases that has impressed me personally as the CEO:\n\n1. Writing Code: Like Ryan Dahl said, all of our software engineers have kinda become product managers because almost all actual code is written using AI agents like Windsurfs Cascade! I believe Cursor is pretty good as well but we use Windsurf mostly!\n2. A/B Testing at Scale:  Our team setup an automation flow using N8N that automatically uses Google Nano Banana and Gemini to generate ad variations using our Google ads data! This is then tested and auto improved on based on results! This is literally manual work that used to take ours and freelance designers to modify the assets! We still review the ads but 90% of the time is saved! \n3. Call Summary &amp; Action Items: We have setup otter to record all our customer calls! It auto generates transcript, summary and action items. This is then auto sync'ed to our customer database in notion so now no meeting ever gets lost again. \n4. Blogs &amp; Social Media Content: We have used AI tools like frizerly to automate the process of coming up of a content strategy using our Google search data. This is then used to automatically publish a blog on our website every day using our internal data like customer testimonials, case studies etc. The content is then repurposed into social media posts and posted automatically as well! This has helped us show up more often on Google search results and not look dead on social media tbh! It's quite impressive how AI can create full blown images for instagram posts featuring actual products etc!\n5. Auto Resolving Repetitive Support Tickets: We have been able to resolve repetitive customer support tickets using Intercom fin quite well! Other questions are still manually handled by our support team! \n\nAnd that's all I can think of rn! Following to see what others are using it for :)",

Here are a few use cases I think are helpful for almost any business:\n\n1. Faster content creation + repurposing (marketing/social media) AI can help generate ideas or turn one concept into multiple formats: posts for different platforms, story/script ideas, and it can also improve or help create captions, descriptions, headlines, and versions for different tones and audiences. This saves time and makes posting consistently easier, without burnout.\n2. Call summaries + follow-up support for sales. After speaking with a potential client, you can use AI to quickly create a short call summary, highlight key points (what the client needs, their questions, concerns), and draft a follow-up message: an email or a short text with clear next steps.\n3. Customer support + FAQ automation A simple chatbot/support assistant that answers common questions and hands off complex cases to a human. Saves time and improves response speed.\n4. Internal knowledge base search So your team can ask things like “what’s our refund policy?” or “how do we price X?” and get answers directly from your docs. Saves time and makes work smoother for everyone.\n5. Basic operational automations Workflows like: form submitted → create a deal in the CRM → assign an owner → send an onboarding email → set a follow-up task. It removes a lot of unnecessary steps and simplifies the workflow.\n6. Data cleanup + research. AI can help with lead categorization, summarizing competitor pages and reviews, and spotting recurring patterns in customer feedback.\n\nOne key point: the best ROI usually comes from embedding AI into an existing workflow, not trying to replace everything at once. Start with one bottleneck (support, sales, admin) and measure the impact.",

Se l'IA non vede un impatto diretto sul cliente, quel costo va tagliato.\n3. **Customer Impact Mapping istantaneo:** Puoi usare l'IA per analizzare i feedback dei competitor e generare una **Customer Impact Map** che ti dica esattamente dove il mercato sta fallendo, permettendoti di essere rilevante in 7 secondi.\n\nEssere 'AI First' significa usare l'intelligenza artificiale per uscire dal **Labirinto della vaghezza** dieci volte più velocemente degli altri.

We already launched in Europe (starting with Spain) and our current setup is this: \n\n\\-We already have a local payroll provider\n\n\\-We have a local accounting firm\n\nBUT, it is becoming too hard to continue this way and I will list the reasons below: \n\n1. We are concerned that we are overpayng some taxes \n\n2. We’ve noticed many frequent mistakes from both payroll and accounting providers\n\n3. Salary miscalculations and Incorrect payslips every other month\n\n4. Some issues managing employee medical checks\n\n5. And on top of this, VERY slow replies and poor English support (I guess, you get what you pay for- and in Spain apparently, English is not so used). But we learned the lesson the hard way so we are now looking for alternative local providers in Spain.  \n\nPlease let me know if you have any good EOR companies in mind that could help us fix the above. Ideally a provider that provides both the payroll and accounting services in Spain, but any suggestions are welcome!! Thank you! ",

      "selftext": "So I’ve worked at a small waffle and coffee shop for about 3 years. It’s a small operation in downtown of a large city. The owner recently offered to sell me the business for $65,000. His reasoning is that he wants to free up capital to put into another business he’s scaling, and he feels comfortable passing this one on to me since I already run much of the day-to-day. They’re hardly there in person at this point, maybe once a month or every other month to collect the cash. We’re located in a small food hall under an office building, so there’s a constant supply of costumers from there. Not enough to keep our numbers where we want, but it helps make sure we’re never actually dead I think. We’re also located right by the theatre district so whenever there’s ballet shows or operas it guarantees some traffic. The rent is also taken by the food hall as a percentage of our sales so whenever it’s slow we don’t get hurt too badly. Another factor maybe worth considering is that we partnered with Starbucks, so we buy their products and can sell them, something he already paid the license for.\n\nSome numbers:\n\n•\tMonthly sales usually fall between $5k–$7k per week. Highs of 8k+\n\n•\tAverage month is around $30-35k. Busy months can get close to $40k, slowest (usually just January) is around 25\n\n•\tHe claims the business nets about $3k–$4k in profit per month\n\nWhat I’m trying to figure out:\n\n•\tOn the surface, does a $65k asking price sound reasonable given those numbers?\n\n•\tWhat specific documents should I ask to see before even considering this seriously?\n\n•\tWhat questions should I be asking about expenses, lease terms, debt, equipment, etc.?\n\n•\tWhat are common things first-time buyers overlook in situations like this?\n\nI’m not rushing into anything — just trying to educate myself before I say yes or no. I appreciate any insight from people who’ve bought or sold small businesses before.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEdit : I’ve seen it brought up and forgot to mention originally, but equipment is rented from the food hall so we don’t pay for repairs.\n\nThis was a bit of a passion project originally for the owners, but they’ve been too busy with their other jobs and their family to dedicate the time theyd like to it. I have a great relationship with them and consider them friends at this point. All the other owners of the stalls in this food hall are personally here most if not every day, but it’s been a point of pride for me to manage this place without them needing to be here. We have a small team but everyone’s awesome and covers whenever needed\n\nThe 3-4k profit would be after all expenses, including my current wages and inventory. There’s also ways to save money, for example they spend a ton on delivery for ingredients since theyre too busy to go to the store themselves.\n\nAlso this is not a franchise.",

          "body": "Let’s say $3K/month net, so $36K/year profits.  Most coffee shops sell for 2x to 3x seller’s discretionary earnings.  That gives a valuation between $72K and $108K.\n\nSo the price seems OK, but you need to factor in add-backs and takeaways.  So if, for example, one owner does the accounting for free and you are going to have to pay for it, take that away from profits.  If the shop pays for the owner’s kid’s cell phone, add that back into profits.  Also, you have to account for any tax shenanigans, like off-book pocketing of cash sales.\n\nIf the owners are putting in very little effort, and it is netting $36K a year, there is some value being realized.\n\nNormally, I would say an opportunity like this is ideal for a seller-financed deal.  You have leverage, as the person who runs the shop day to day.  You leave, he has a burden, which puts you in a negotiating position.  But it sounds like he needs the capital, so he might not be willing to finance a sale.  Usually something like 50% down and remainder from cash flow over 3-5 years is viable and forces the owners to stand behind their profit numbers - no earn out as promised, no payment.\n\n10% net profit is top-quartile earnings for a coffee shop.  They are very finicky though in terms of business model, so you need to model this shop in a spreadsheet and ask questions like “what happens if sales dip 20%?” and “What happens if the price of coffee beans goes up 50%?”  Inputs for coffee, like beans and dairy are among the most volatile commodities and small swings in price can make a 10% net disappear quickly.\n\nYou’d have to look for existential threats.  Is there a large development coming that will kill your foot traffic for nine months?  Is a major employer leaving the area?  Is office space vacancy climbing in the area?  Is the lease on the space ending any time soon?  Is the rent going up any time soon?  Are you on a bus route that is being rerouted?  Have health inspection reports been poor and the next failure brings a shutdown order?  Is there a new competitor opening up down the block?  Coffee shops don’t die from bad coffee, they die from lease failure, labour failure, and sudden loss of foot traffic.\n\nUltimately, buying a coffee shop is a lifestyle business; you are buying a job.  So if your current wage plus $30K or so a year in additional income makes that job attractive enough, it sounds like a solid buy.\n\nYou will want to ask for financial statements and evaluate all obligations like equipment leases.  It is not uncommon for a business like this to have basically no assets.  It is also not uncommon to owe a bunch to suppliers.  Income statement should show bottom line income and balance sheet should show asset values and any debts.  You are going to want to verify those financial statements against the businesses tax returns.  That will keep you from being duped.\n\nAs additional due diligence, you should have a lawyer review all commercial agreements, like lease, Starbucks, etc to ensure no concerns.  You’ll also want to make sure the deal is structured right given the entities involved.  Are you buying shares, are those shares unencumbered, is there tax liability that might survive the sale and fall on you, etc.\n\nAlso, any letter or offer should specify a working capital calculation method and amount.  Very simply, it is usually something like “Price is $75K and includes $10k or working capital. Working capital is calculated as bank accounts plus inventory plus prepaid expenses plus receivables minus accounts payable, minus accrued expenses minus accrued payroll minus accrued taxes”.  This protects you, the buyer, from any actions the seller might take to weaken your economic position.  Common things they can do: slow paying of bulls to increase accounts payable, deplete inventory, call in all outstanding receivables, clear out the bank accounts, process refunds in unsettled credit card transactions, etc.\n\nCash                = $8,000\nInventory           = $12,000\nPayables            = $6,000\nAccrued Wages/Tax   = $4,000\n\nWorkingCapital = (8,000 + 12,000) − (6,000 + 4,000)\n               = 20,000 − 10,000\n               = $10,000\n\nSo if the owner bleeds the business down to $5K and you have a deal set on a working capital of $10K, you pay $5K less for the business.  This keeps you from having to suddenly come up with another $5k in the first weeks of operation to get the business stable with enough capital to operate day to day.\n\nThe one other thing I would say you should look at with a critical eye is the equipment.  Fridges, espresso machines, etc, can all be very expensive and may be nearing end of life.  You’ll need a capital plan for that and need to make the depreciation of those devices is properly accounted for in the financials.  There would be no worse shock than buying this business making $30K a year and finding out that if the replacement of equipment was properly accounted for, it actually was losing $10K a year and now needs a $50K investment in new equipment that is about to reach end of life.",

If you can legitimately run it for a few years and then afford to hire someone to run it for you because the loan is paid and you have a stream of income that is worth considering. But to take a full-time job as a tiny coffee shop in a cafeteria is not a dream to aspire to, it's survival on a basic level.. So if it's useful to you as a stepping stone then maybe. This could be way more of a trap than an opportunity.\n\nWhat if you invest 3 years of your life and then there is a downturn or something that demands you work longer hours and cannot afford to pay anybody else. Now you are literally trapped. That means that every day working there is a day further away from your dreams. \n\nPure speculation but I believe bad business decisions, and going out of business is a lengthy process that takes away several years of a person's life. It's not like it happens in one decision on one day.  Things generally dwindle along for years with uncertainty before people pull the plug.\n\nIf it were me I would explore options to reset my mental framework. For example I would look for another opportunity to start the business in another location. And run through the numbers and then compare the two. Obviously that's a bit much for you at the stage but that is the very first thing that I would do. Then you have a mental comparison to evaluate it as an opportunity or not. When you have nothing, everything looks like an opportunity. When you have success, everything looks like a possible threat to your success.\n\nThe other thing is friendships do not hold water when it comes to money. People will do absolutely anything for money. To the words lie cheat and steal mean anything to you? Don't trust this person. Verify.\n\nI had a friend who was a young woman a number of years ago. She worked at a jewelry store and started dating the owner. He told her she needed to build up her credit and had her get about $60,000 worth of credit cards with which he bought inventory for the store. He never paid her back and destroyed her credit and completely screwed her over. She was like 22 at the time. So just don't trust anyone.\n\nOne of the first things I would do is investigate this guy's decision but that's going to be hard for you to do without business experience. I could have a 5-minute conversation with him and know exactly what's going on based on his responses as being seemingly true or false. That's hard for you to do. But that is your number one objective is true understanding of his motivation. One way that you can do that as a subordinate is to appeal to him with Emotion by having a saying you want to have a sit-down conversation and you've been thinking a lot about it but you're having a lot of concerns about getting trapped and having your life path misdirected. That will engage his emotions and he may reveal further details to you.\n\nI'll give you an example. When I was younger and buying inexpensive cars for transportation, after a complete inspection and review I would always ask one final question. I would say \"look I plan to get in this car and drive it across the country. If I was going to invest $1,000 what are the top three things you would consider spending it on for repairs?\" They would always always exhale deeply, think for a few moments, and then tell me the exact real actual problems the car had.\n\nSo you might say something like look I need this job to support my mother, or I want to have a family Within 3 years and I needed to support me. And then just see if you sense any emotional waffling from him.",

A friend of mine used to own a sandwich franchise and he grew it to one of the top 5 stores by focusing his energy on promoting catering. Again, you can mention it to your regulars, put up signs, buy digital ads that target your zip/area code, etc.\n* Can you add another shift and operate as a ghost kitchen for evening and late night munchie delivery after the building closes? One of the benefits here is that you can start by trying it only fri/sat nights and if someone calls in sick then it's not the end of the world because the building is closed and you'll just show up as temporarily closed on the food app. Depending on what you have now, you might have to add a special oven that would let you do pizza, chicken wings, etc. You can go by a completely different name in the delivery app to avoid confusing customers.",

          "body": "First off, everyone here is right about the lease. I see you said it's a food hall, they and malls are notorious for jacking up rents based on foot traffic increases so make sure you see the actual lease you are committing to and ask if it is a flat rate or \"percentage\" lease. Given you stated that the equipment is provided I have a gut feeling your rent will be percent or per sale based in whole or part. The equipment rent is weird to me, if not bundled in the lease you need to know the exact costs associated with it. Same goes for the rest of the FF&amp;E, utility share, etc... There are hidden costs all over with a business like this and everything from your cups to your water bill can impact your profitability if the costs go up even slightly. \n\nSecond, owners do sometimes step away from cashflow generating businesses at a modest sum, but this is the exception NOT the rule. Anyone operating an absentee or near-absentee business successfully and profiting from it is unlikely to sell at a low cost and typically seeks a higher multiple due to the low effort required to operate and high cost of them to replace that recurring revenue. Be open but skeptical (you are on the right path asking what to request from them). Ask them casual questions like what they're going to do with all of the free time they have. Answers like retirement or traveling are often acceptable (especially if they are older) but if they don't seem to have any idea there's a good chance you have something lurking they are worried about. A good example right now is single owner liquor stores. As alcohol sales decline and rents increase, many of these are selling at a low price trying to exit the market and pivot to something else rather than lose everything. Think about it from all angles you possibly can. \n\nThird, when a business owner tells you they make $3k to $4k in profit each month you should ask if that includes their cashflow (or owner draws / owner pay). If it doesn't, that means that you'll personally take home this amount or about $48,000 pre-tax if you hire someone to replace you (add in your current income if you can do it all yourself). If it does include their owner draws  /cashflow it means you'll make less than this and need to find ways to support yourself while building the business. You're in Washington with no personal income tax but you will need to collect sales tax and pay the Business &amp; Occupation (B&amp;O) Tax if I'm seeing this correctly. I'd investigate the taxes being paid now and if there are any changes slated for the future as part of the due diligence since the total profit is quite low.",

You need to do some due diligence. For example, some businesses took out adjustable APR loans during the pandemic that are now coming due... you need to see what kind of debt liability, if any, this business has and if it's assumable upon purchase. For example, I have a business local to me that did this, confident on growth projections, that is now completely underwater and desperate to sell. You don't want to be on the hook for a gamble/loss situation. \n\n\n\nAfter you do the financial due diligence, you'll want to consider the lease terms, if they are assumable and, if so, how long is left. What kind of increases are permitted, etc. If you get to this point, I'd strongly recommend hiring a lease attorney to negotiate caps (usually on annual percentage increases and CAM fees) for you. This would depend, of course, on if the lease is attached to the seller personally or his business, among other things. \n\n\nIf the business has some sort of agreement with Starbucks, you also need to determine what type of contract is in place for that, how much it is, and how long it is for. \n\nFirst thing first, though, get your hands on his Financials. \n\n\nETA: a fair asking price for most businesses is 4-5xs EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization). Seeing his P&amp;L and balance sheet will tell you if his asking price is fair. Doesn't mean you can't haggle or negotiate down, though. The low asking price is a bit of a red flag for me personally, but it could genuinely be that he is desperate for cash. \n\n\nAlso check out your local SBDC branch, as they often offer free business advising services.

You probably don't even need the name and location of the businesses if they'll give you the figures \"blind\" and offer to tell you more if you're interested.\n\nThis will educate you *a lot* as to what the market expectations are like for various levels of revenue, rent etc. If after looking at twenty coffee shops for sale yours looks like a bargain (25% or more less than expected price), find a way to make it happen. Vendor finance, silent partner investor, wife's uncle, whatever.\n\nIf it doesn't, maybe you're better off to buy another coffee shop for $40,000 that's being badly run. In hospitality among the best businesses to look for are the ones that are dirty and run-down in appearance (because you can clean up) and that are being run by an asshole (because you can be nice to customers) and are *still* making a small profit because the rent is low and the position is such that customers have little other choice than to go there. And make sure the equipment is reasonably good. Those factors together are a huge green flag. (WARNING: the asshole may be selling because they have heard a competitor is opening up. If there are already multiple competitors, this issue is probably a lot less important.)\n\nAnother option here, if the business is good (let's say worth $100K at market rate) but you personally can't come up with the money, is you offer to help the current owner sell it. You agree to stay on, work on increasing the value of the business enough to cover a broker's commission and lawyers' fees etc (figure maybe $10,000) and then when it's sold anything over $65,000 you keep, and you stay on as an employee of the new owner or go buy your own shop.",

      "selftext": "I run a small custom t-shirt and apparel printing business and just got completely screwed by what I thought was a legit customer. Guy contacted me in November wanting 200 custom hoodies for his company’s winter event. We went back and forth on designs, he approved everything, paid the 50% deposit, which seemed totally normal. He specifically wanted this textured raised ink effect which required puff printing and that added to the cost but he said no problem. I ordered all the blank hoodies, did the setup work, printed everything, shipped it all out in early December. He confirmed delivery and even sent me a photo saying they looked great.   \nThen last week I got notified by my payment processor that he filed a dispute claiming the quality wasn’t as described and he wants a full refund including the deposit. I reached out immediately with all our email correspondence, the approved design files, his confirmation photo, everything. The payment processor said they’re still reviewing but it could go either way.   \nI’m out almost $4000 in materials and labor if this goes through. I’ve been researching wholesale suppliers on alibaba trying to find cheaper blank hoodies for future orders so I can build in more buffers for situations like this but that doesn’t help me now.  \n Do I need a lawyer? Can I even fight this effectively? I have a small business account but not tons of cash reserves to just absorb this loss. Has anyone dealt with chargeback fraud like this before? I’m freaking out here.",

This isn't the same thing as not paying an invoice for a service provided.\n\nIf it were me, if they don't respond to my email request trying to make it right, I'd hire a lawyer and send them a strongly worded, certified letter educating them on the fact they've committed theft, highlighting previous case law, and pointing out it is a felony due to the value of the product. If they ignore the letter/don't respond, press charges. This isn't them not paying an invoice that you take to small claims court. This is fraud, and theft of product. Not services.\n\nGive them the opportunity to make it right, and maybe even offer a 10% discount, since they seem to think the product is not to their standard. Alternatively, they can return all of the product for a refund per your original contract (Hopefully you stated deposits are non-refundable. Do not refund the deposit).\n\nThen turn around and burn the company by turning those hoodies into some sort of art piece and selling them for cheap. Double points if you're in the companies HQ town.

Call your processor and push for “representment” Ask what reason code it is and what evidence they weigh most for that code. Use their exact checklist.\n2. Send a formal demand letter Even without a lawyer, a short written demand (amount owed, deadline, evidence, next steps) can scare scammers. A local small-business attorney can write it cheaply if needed.\n3. If you have his company details, invoice the business and pursue small claims $4k is often within small-claims limits. Your documentation sounds strong.\n4. Protect yourself going forward\n\n* For custom orders: “No refunds after approval/production” in writing\n* Consider 60–100% upfront for large custom runs\n* Signed proof at delivery, photo of finished goods before ship\n* Pay via ACH/wire for big B2B jobs (harder to chargeback)\n* Add a clause: disputes must be raised within X days of delivery\n\nNot legal advice, but with an approval trail + delivery proof + “looks great” message, you have a solid case for winning the dispute.

The hard part is not just “winning the dispute,” it’s that one chargeback can create a cash crunch because you already paid for blanks, labor, shipping, and you cannot resell the product. That’s why for big custom orders you want a simple system that treats chargebacks like a predictable risk: clear written approvals, “custom goods are final” terms, signature delivery, and milestone payments before shipment so you are never carrying the full cost.\n\nThis is also exactly why weekly cash planning matters. If one dispute can put you underwater, it means there is no buffer for shocks. A weekly view of minimum cash you refuse to dip under, big payments coming up, and what is safe to spend this week keeps one bad customer from becoming a business-threatening week. If you share the dispute reason and whether you have signature delivery, I can tell you what evidence usually matters most in the response.",

Up until now, I’ve been paid a $250K salary.\n\nHe’s offering to sell me the company under the following terms:\n\n\t•\tPurchase price: $6.2M\n\n\t•\tThis is based on a company valuation of $3.6M\n\n\t•\tThe difference comes from a 6% interest rate over a 20-year seller-financed note\n\n\t•\tI would own 100% of the company immediately and owe my uncle payments over 20 years\n\n\t•\tThe valuation was done by an outside valuation firm\n\n\t•\tNo bank financing, all seller financed\n\nWhat I’m struggling with is whether the structure is fair.\n\nOn one hand, I get full ownership immediately, the business is established, and seller financing avoids bank risk. On the other hand, 6% over 20 years feels expensive, especially given that I’ve already dedicated 12 years of my career here and gave up outside opportunities to help grow the company.\n\nI can’t tell if this is a normal arms-length deal that just feels uncomfortable because it’s family, or if the terms are tilted in his favor.\n\nI’d really appreciate thoughts from people who have bought businesses, worked in family businesses, or structured seller-financed deals.\n\nAm I overthinking this, or should I be pushing back harder on the terms?",

I’m guessing his loan has no early payoff clause, so he can have the interest income for the next 20 years. If so, you could invest that $500k in something safe that makes that same or more interest.  If not, you’ll pay off the loan in a couple of years. \n\nHe is rewarding your years of loyalty and hard work with this offer. And you’ll have a free consultant if you ever need one.",

And you can write down depreciation on those hard assets, unlike a business’s “reputation and brand value”. If there’s no hard assets, in many fields (but obviously not all) a small business may more normally sell for 2-4x the owners discretionary income (more or less). You can add the hard assets to this valuation and get a guess at a price. There are people who specialize in business valuation based on the specific conditions, financials, industry, market and assets. For a multi-million dollar sale, it’s probably worth hiring a business pro to do this- maybe pick one with your uncle and agree to use that objective valuation to avoid any hurt feelings within the family.",

We both wake up around 4:30–5am,  leave the house around 7am, and the days don’t really stop until late at night. He’s still a technician in the field managing service calls and two techs. I handle everything else: phones, scheduling, billing, payroll, marketing, reviews, follow-ups, permits, subcontractors, networking, thank-you letters, etc.\n\nOn top of that, we have a blended family with rotating custody schedules, a toddler we co-sleep with (unfortunately), pets, and a household that I largely manage. I do the grocery shopping, cooking, laundry, homework, bedtime routines, appointments, and most of the mental load. We do have a house cleaner twice a month and someone who mows the lawn during the summer season, but day-to-day life still feels relentless.\n\nLately, I feel completely invisible.\n\nWhen my husband comes home, he checks out and doom scrolls on his phone while I scramble to get dinner, manage kids, clean up, and try to keep everything afloat. Tonight, during an argument, he asked me what I even do all day because he doesn’t understand why I don’t have time to move money between business accounts. That comment broke something in me.\n\nWe barely touch anymore. We co-sleep with our toddler, and the little intimacy that we do have feels rushed and more about his needs than connection. I don’t get compliments. I don’t feel desired. I’ve asked to be told I’m beautiful, and it just doesn’t happen. I put effort into showing I care, but I don’t feel it reciprocated.\n\nHe says he’s tired. I am too, but I still show up for him.\n\nWe argue more than we connect. I’m scared we’re going to lose our marriage trying to build this business. I feel lonely even when he’s in the house. Tonight he chose to sleep downstairs, even though we had the opportunity to be close, and that made it hurt worse.\n\nMy spark feels gone. I don’t feel seen, valued, or appreciated - as a partner, a woman, or a person. I don’t know if this is burnout, resentment, or the beginning of the end.\n\nIf you’ve built a business with your spouse:  \n• How did you divide labor without resentment?  \n• How did you reconnect emotionally?  \n• How did you stop feeling like roommates or coworkers?  \n• Or how did you know it was time to make a bigger change?\n\nI’m open to hard truths.

I recommend you find a block of time that's at least 4 hours long. Plan it at least a day or two in the future. No work, no children, nothing else. Be direct with your husband: \"this isn't sustainable, and we're at risk of losing both our company and this marriage\". But, at that point, give him space to ponder things while you try to balance your spinning plates until the block of time arrives.\n\nThen, start with \"I love you\", and \"this isn't working for me, but I want to find a way to make it work for both of us\".\n\nMaybe you need a nanny/helper at the house. Maybe you need an employee to assist with the office operations. Maybe you need another senior tech in the field. I don't know. It's not my place. But, clearly, there's not enough time in the day for everything, so it's time to get creative on what can buy you time. Including buying time together. You both figured out how to get this all going, I'm confident you can work there's and figure out how to make it work better.\n\nOh, and couples therapy might help. Maybe you don't need a therapist, but you clearly do need to allocate time each week that's just for you both without distractions.",

She helped build the business to a huge level and to simply be a home mom was a huge change of identity. And that became a hard part in our relationship. I felt I put more into our business while every inch I moved us she would undo by poor financial management and lack of follow through. \nI was pushing forward at all cost….\n  We saw a decline in her health and that was the breakthrough to get her to begin leaving the business.

          "body": "Honestly, we realized that our marriage was more important than the business and one of us exited.\n\nIt’s easy to think that if you are partners in life, why not in business? In reality, it is a very rare couple that works well together. I mean, exceedingly rare. I have seen a lot more couples divorce after embarking on a joint venture than sustain it for years. \n\nHow is the business structured? Do you have a well defined role or are you just “helping out”? Do you get a paycheck? Because handling admin for a service based business is no small task. And if he doesn’t appreciate the work you put in, perhaps he should try hiring someone else to do the job. Then he’ll find out that no employee wants to regularly put in 12 hour days “because they care about the business”. They don’t care. After he runs through 3-5 of them, maybe he’ll have a different perspective on things.\n\nBottom line, takes a toll on your marriage. We tried to figure out a way to make it work for years but it was breaking me to have to manage my spouse. If there was tension at home it came to work, and vice versa. Our marriage still hasn’t really recovered and we were in a similar position, co-sleeping toddler too, when we started working together. Thankfully our child is older now but it was rough going for awhile there. You do lose yourself and that connection because you are just getting through the days. \n\nMy best advice would be to define everything about your role down to the last detail, look at a typical salary for your area for that type of position, and show him those numbers. It’s too easy to take someone for granted when the work they do isn’t quantified. But also, consider that a vast majority of couples do not work together or even work in related fields and there’s a reason for that. That much overlap creates friction and it’s not anyone’s fault, it’s the nature of the beast. Once I let go of the idea that we “should” be able to make it work it became much easier to look at the situation objectively.",

Somehow. Maybe a small ultimatum to make him turn his head and notice you, and all you are doing. Or perhaps “boundary” is better than ultimatum, I don’t know exactly what, perhaps you’ll be able to figure out something appropriate, being closer to the situation.\n\nIf we assume the best, that “everyone is doing their best from their current state of awareness” - then perhaps he just needs a little more awareness :)\n\nEDIT: wanted to add something I think is important here: extrapolating from my own life, based on the schedule you described, it’s not really surprising that you guys barely have time or energy for each other. That’s a nearly impossible situation. Working like that drains everything out of you and there’s just nothing left in the tank for intimacy or connection. \n\nI highly recommend that if this is what you guys need to do, and you’re making enough money, make sure you can get away for a night or two at least once a month, and at least one other date night or two each month. Getting out of that day-to-day situation is the only way you’re going to connect. Recently, my wife and I started trying to do a staycation / Airbnb once every two months let’s say.

I manage the employees. I do the paperwork, taxes, compliance, sales, follow ups, bookkeeping, etc. Additionally we have a passel of kids and I do drop off and pick up everyday. I make their breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Organize activities and play dates, drive to all the things. I cook and clean and do laundry.  \n\nAnd any time any thing goes wrong, he blames me. Everything is my fault. He’s very good at our shared business. It was his concept. But now I run it with his input. And (according to him) do everything wrong. And also clearly don’t care enough to get it right. And he has sooooo much to do with his other job… like take breaks to take walks, workout, nap, read about his work stuff while laying in bed. I’m not saying he doesn’t work, but it’s fucking frustrating when I’m running on 4 hours of sleep and constantly running everywhere and he’s complaining about a mistake I made while on a walk with the dog or laying down. \n\nWe fight nonstop and I hate it. I hate it for the kids. I hate it for me. I feel myself getting smaller. \n\nThe one place this isn’t an issue is in the bedroom. We are killing it there. 🙃 \n\nAnyway… I have no words of advice or help… just I’m there with you, sister. I feel you and it fucking sucks. If money weren’t an issue, an afternoon helper would make a huge impact for me and I’m sure for you too. It isn’t sustainable. \n\nOk I lied I do have one piece of advice… the bedroom thing… get the toddler out of your bed. It will be hard at first but do it. Then start to make sex a priority. That’s what we did. Even if it wasn’t the most perfect moment, if one of us was into it, we did it. And damn if no matter how blah I was about it when we started, I was very into it by the end. Saying yes has not failed us yet in the bedroom. Obviously that hasn’t saved our situation, but it really does make a difference for the roommate feel. \n\nWishing you all the luck! ❤️",

Reconnect emotionally is simple but not easy.  You just need to have fun together.  Find ways to laugh together.  That’s a Herculean task when you have businesses and living.  A lot of people like to recommend couples counseling, but with business owners that just becomes another task and rarely works.\n\n3.  Start touching each other.  Every opportunity to hold hands, grab butts, pick lint, bump into each other, get in each others path.\n\n4.  If you are unsatisfied then it is always time to make a big change, but make sure the juice is worth the squeeze.  If you are miserable now at 40 and you do nothing, do you think at 45 things will be better?  You think you are bitter and resentful now, do the same thing for 5 more years.",

One of the biggest shifts we made was realising that the home is another business. If we tried to run it like a “normal household” on top of running an actual company, we would have burned out completely.\n\nSo we outsource as much as we realistically can:\n\t•\tcleaning\n\t•\tlaundry / ironing\n\t•\tfood shopping\n\t•\tmeal prep where possible\n\t•\tlawn and outside jobs\n\t•\tsome personal admin\n\nNot because we’re lazy but because our time and energy are better spent on high-value tasks: in the business, in the relationship, and with our children.\n\nWe did the same inside the business. We invested early in admin and office support because growth (and sanity) required it. Trying to do everything yourself is a fast track to resentment.\n\nThat said — even with help, we’re still exhausted at times. This isn’t a magic fix.\n\nWe also have young children, and when I’m at home I want to be present with them. Not half-working, half-scrolling, half-thinking about what I forgot to do. I still don’t get the balance right but outsourcing the background noise of life gives us a fighting chance.\n\nWhat’s mattered just as much as practical help is alignment.\n\nWe regularly check in on:\n\t•\tAre we on the same page about where the business is going?\n\t•\tDo we agree on why we’re pushing this hard?\n\t•\tAre we both choosing this  — or is one of us just enduring it?\n\nWe take a full day once a quarter to map everything out — business, home, pressure points, capacity. It’s not romantic, but it stops silent resentment building.\n\nWe also talk openly about the pitfalls. Work will take over if you let it. So we’re very intentional about:\n\t•\tno-work-talk moments\n\t•\tno-phone time\n\t•\tactually being present with each other, even when we’re shattered\n\nWe co-sleep too, and I won’t pretend our relationship is top priority all the time. Sometimes it genuinely isn’t. This life isn’t rainbows and butterflies.\n\nBut we make a conscious effort to keep showing up imperfectly, but intentionally. We want to be successful and we want our relationship to survive this season.\n\nSo the question I’d ask: \n\nAre you aligned on where you’re going, why you’re doing this, and what support you’re allowed to bring in without guilt?\n\nIf the structure doesn’t change, the feeling you’re describing won’t go away — it will just harden. That doesn’t mean your marriage is failing. It means the system around you is overloaded.\n\nYou’re not invisible.\nYou’re not asking for too much.\nYou’re just carrying too much without enough support around you.\n\nAnd you’re definitely not alone x",

Some of them were natural phases of marriage that I think come along with raising children and being in a relationship for a long time. And I truly think we would have had most of those same struggles regardless of our careers. \n\nIn the business we have had gone through periods (like when our kids were young) that I took much more of a backseat and really limited my involvement as I focused more on the household. And then the pendulum has swung and now that our kids our school aged, my husband manages much more of the household (picking up kids from school, packing lunches, making dinner, etc), while I have gotten to step back in and be more of the point person and expert at work. It has been a really nice shift for both of us to have some role reversal and appreciation for what the other one contributes. \n\nSo although we struggle with all of the exact things you mention,  I think so much of this is a relationship problem. Running a business together can magnify these issues, but they would be there even if you had separate jobs. \n\nHaving a partner who can help share in not only the physical tasks, but also in the mental workload is huge. And although I am sure he is navigating his own burnout and struggles, from your side of things, it really sounds like he is dropping the ball, and the current situation is not sustainable. There is some great suggestions in here on the needed conversations. If your husband is willing to listen and work together to help make some adjustments, I think there is a great opportunity to help you both reconnect, prevent burnout, and improve. You deserve a partner in business AND life who appreciates you and joins along side you.",

You say you’re both busy and somewhat successful, but still feel like you’re constantly trying not to fall behind. That’s a classic trap for service business owners who haven’t raised prices enough to create the margin needed to hire help, systematize, and buy back time.\n\nNot trying to sell you anything — even though, yeah, this would be an easy pitch and maybe I’m off, but let me ask this…\n\nWhen’s the last time you and your husband actually sat down and talked strategy? Not just surviving the week, but real conversations like:\nHow can we be more efficient?\nWhat can we simplify or delegate?\nWhat level of growth would let us both work fewer hours and actually have time for each other?\n\nBecause without those talks, it’s really easy to stay stuck in survival mode — busy, tired, and slowly drifting further apart instead of building something that creates freedom.\n\nI learned this the hard way. My wife worked in the medical field and wasn’t involved in my business, but I tried to include her in my plans for growth and what that could mean for our future. She wasn’t interested, and over time she resented how much I worked. Back then I wasn’t making much, but we paid the bills, ate out sometimes, and took small trips.\n\nWe’re divorced now. She’s still in the same career and as dar as i know enjoys what she does. I went through years of struggle as an entrepreneur, but I never stopped having those strategy conversations — even when it was just me.

It’s about showing how critical intentional planning is and the cost not being can have on a marriage. You rarely know exactly how you’ll get where you want to go, but if you’re not talking about it, defining it, and working toward it together, you stay stuck.\n\nAnd staying stuck too long turns into bitterness.

His responsibility in the company kept piling up, but he couldn't quit because the profits were growing too.\n\nIn one sense, your husband's mentality of \"I'd just go find employment rather than learn your side of business\" is correct. The world would still go around even if you dropped everything right now. You won't lose your house over it.\n\nYou first have to figure out which parts of the job you absolutely hate, and which are alright. The parts you hate have to be delegated as much as possible. If you hate putting in the receipts onto the accounting system, in an extreme sense pay a local kid $40 to spend 2 hours manually typing everything in every month. If you think \"that's expensive\", how much will YOU need to be paid for you to happily do the same job for someone else?\n\nNext, there are a few tasks there that won't hurt you even if you let it go completely. You can let go of social media and review responses. The largest sticking point of a client base is usually having a reasonable job done and any aftercare if a problem arises. They don't care if your Email response is 3 hours late. They don't care how you respond to their 5 star review. The business won't die.\n\nYour husband needs to delegate some tasks too, and reduce his workload. Did you know that rejecting some jobs \"because you are overbooked\" doesn't hurt your business? It simply makes you look popular. Alternatively, raising prices until some clients move away.\n\n\nFinally, discussing family time. Never Split The Difference has good negotiation tactics to get your feelings heard. \n\nThe problem with his \"Why can't you do this, what do you do all day?\" Is that he refuses to see labour he considers free/profit-less. If moving money is that easy, why won't he do it himself? It's because there's mental workload involved. It hurts you because you are drowning with tasks that he admits that it's impossible for him to do.\n\nYou both need more free time to open up the emotional capacity. Remember, you are not doing work he won't do, you are doing work he can't, and you are allowed to switch the off button. Discuss with him that the business will be shut down before the marriage ends, and you're going to save the marriage first. You'll both make changes, and if the business can't function with the new direction, then accept that the business was imcompatible with a healthy family work life balance.",

Then a year and a half ago my company did layoffs, so my husband was super energetic about me working FT for the business and how I’m the secret sauce. I was hesitant because I liked MY own paycheck but 3 months later we got married, 2 months after that January 2025 we got a puppy and that made me not want to physically leave the home. He’s a cavapoo and very clingy. My husband is all for this role. We have been way more successful (by the grace of god) by me working for our biz and we make more then my salary was bringing in.\n\n• How did you reconnect emotionally?\nThis is a good question. I am now pregnant with our first child and during the week “life happens” we both work, he’s on the field I WFH and handle all household operations as well as computer. He also though steps in ALOT and loves doing things for me… he’s always insisting on doing the dishes after dinner, never complains when I don’t feel like cooking, he’s super clean and organized as am I but we don’t have set roles. I do mainly cook dinner but since I’ve been tired due to pregnancy, he’s stepped up and made some great meals even after a hard day.\n\n• How did you stop feeling like roommates or coworkers?\nYou need to designate a weekend date night, make chores fun, even food shopping we love going together, get a babysitter and go out for a few hours just you 2. We don’t have much family here but thankfully my mother is nearby so alot of the time we even drop our dog off to her on Fri night and go out have fun and grab him the next morning and we will be doing that with our child as well. I’m sure there will be harder seasons for sure but maybe also try getting your kid out of the bed in the future so it’s just u guys again? \n\n• Or how did you know it was time to make a bigger change? If we’re out walking the dog we will catch up briefly on work cuz he’s on site all day so for me I call him for a 3 min convo or when he goes to store runs he always calls to catch up and see how my days going. Estimates and typing them always happen after work but we try to get them done one day a week. It’s tough but u both need to want to set boundaries and keep your marriage alive.

This by it's nature will mess any man up and cause them to lash out as they feel less of man and things are closing in on them.  He probably sees you, and feels he isn't performing even though you have probably never said anything about it and thinks he is doing fine.\n\nWith the pressure of the businesses pushing so hard on all of you, it is time to hire administrative staff to take off the load.  Trying to do it all and take care of family is too much pressure long term which both of you are seeing and feeling.\n\nI would heavily recommend hiring a manager to help take care of the day to day to include the duties you have been doing this whole time and add in guardrails e.g., requirement to sign for purchases/expenses over x amount.  For your husband it is time for him to step back or the pressure will literally put him in the hospital.  He needs to downgrade to just doing initial training, and administrative duties so he can actually enjoy life as the time lost just working makes this a job and not an actual business.  Fine if it was just him and this was just starting up, but that time has come and gone. Both of you will need to learn to delegate or it will mess both of you up mentally and physically.  If this means hiring new employees make it happen so you can both get your time back.\n\nAt the end of the day family needs to come first, no point just running a business without being able to spend reasonable time with family.  When we overdue putting in too much into the business without properly learning to delegate turns things in the wrong direction as both of you are seeing now.\n\nHave a talk with him and get the delegating done or reduce the service calls to help get both yours time to enjoy life back in order.",

I can only share what we did and what worked - just as some ideas. \n\nOur business is different (manufacturing and e-commerce of those products). I'm the business/e-commerce/customer side, he's the manufacturing side. First, I felt totally burned out (our son was 4-5 at that time). Too much to do, not enough time, nothing was done as well as it needed to be. I decided to do a hard inventory of our business (I went to a hotel for a weekend alone and put up pieces of paper on the wall and wrote all my ideas, etc). Here's what we did:\n\n\\- I focused on two overarching principles: less work but same output (systems and equipment), and \"outsource that sh\\*\\*\"). I started making a list of every single task I handled, as well as the frequency (like \"run payroll, every 2 weeks on Friday\"). I sorted it in two different ways: one was \"time-suck\" - put the most time-consuming items at the top and go down the list. Second one was: what do I absolutely hate doing.\n\n\\-From there I worked systematically through the list. Examples of my time-sucks were: 1) customers calling and rather than asking a directed question, which I could answer in 5 minutes of my time, they would chat and chat and tell me all sorts of issues with their entire project rather than MY part of the project. 2) manually entering all orders into the system and following it through the order workflow.",

This is more of a burnout problem than anything to do with the business itself.\n\n&gt; How did you divide labor without resentment?\n\nThis isn't a high school group project. We're married and part of the entire reason we got married is because we work better together than apart. I'm good at certain aspects of the business while he's good at other aspects. Marriage, and business partnership, is all about harmony. You come together to create something bigger than just the two of you. The moment you start keeping score at all, is the moment you stop being a relationship. Sometimes I really cannot be bothered to do the dishes especially after a long day, and vice versa. You know what we do? We thanklessly and silently fill in each others gaps. He'll cover for dishes if I'm tired and sometimes I'll cover, even though the goal is always a balance that feels \"right\". Both of us care a lot about trying to do our fair share as an innate quality of our character. Sometimes we're both exhausted and the dishes pile up, sometimes I end up doing laundry for a month straight. And you know what? That's ok - what important is that it gets done eventually and we are on each other's team to handle whatever life throws our way. \n\nStop keeping score (and he needs to as well).\n\n&gt; How did you reconnect emotionally?\n\nWe do things for each other all the time. We also go on dates. I don't need to reconnect because I never lost connection. This is a lot easier to if you're not burnt out, which you are because you're working 2-3x more than you should be working. If you can't cut your current working hours in half, you don't have a sustainable business and **that** needs fixed first thing. Hire/outsource, start being smart about your business acumen, stop grinding. If you're grinding and it isn't your first year in business you're doing something wrong and there's further optimizing to be done. Business isn't only about making the numbers grow big forever - you can decide for yourself what success means. It's ok to make less money to have a better work life balance despite what wall street and the money gambling addicted billionaire class wants you to believe.\n\n&gt; How did you stop feeling like roommates or coworkers?\n\nSee above.

I have done some business with them before and would plan on doing it in the future so I prefer to be problem adverse, so I just said ok, you can wire me back my money. He says he will try to convince the seller to release it for that amount. About 3 weeks pass with me calling weekly until just over a week ago he says \"Sorry, I'm going to tell my boss to send you back your money\" (His boss is his dad). It's been a week and some change now and nothing. I tried calling him and his dad every day this week, left voicemails, no response, no callback. This is all very unprofessional and frustrating, at what point do I take them to small claims court or something else to get my money back? Any other suggestions?",

Open ended questions: instead of telling them what you think is wrong ask them \"Well what would happen if none of the stuff I left you got done?\"\n\nThese tend to help you get across a point without you telling them and they usually will realize your point on their own. Or you realize they don't understand the purpose behind the work and you can clarify it. \n\n2. Mirroring: basically you repeat the last couple words they said or in the sentence they said in a question. \n\nExample: \nX: well lashaun never had me do any of that, just deal with customers. \n\nYou: Never had you do that?\n\nX: yeah she said it was all manager stuff anyways. \n\nThis will always get people to expand on something or explain. \n\nYou can also purposely say something a little incorrect back to them and they will instinctively want to correct you and give you more information. \n\nExample:\n\nX: well lashaun never had me do any of that, just deal with customers. \n\nYou: Had you do everything?\n\nX: No no no, she told me that was all manager stuff so she never had me do that stuff. \n\n3. Commit with a no, people feel safe saying no, so instead of trying to get them to say yes to something, rephrase your question to a no. \n\nExample:\n\nWould I be crazy to ask you to just finish the list I give you for work? \n\nAm I being an asshole to tell you to take out the trash? \n\nEtc.\n\n4. \"Seems like\", similar to mirroring but you make an assumption, start it with seems like, looks like, feels like, sounds like, etc and state your assumption of what you think is happening and let them comment on it or correct you. \n\nExample:\n\nYou: It seems like Lashaun never properly trained you. \n\nX: Yeah she never did any training with me .......\n\nOr\n\nYou: Seems like you feel underpaid and treated like shit. \n\nX: I mean I could always use more pay but you have actually been pretty fine as a boss.\n\n5. Put them together, you can use those techniques together to basically pull lots of information from this employee, understand them and their viewpoint completely, and then from this understanding help them shift it by aligning what you want them to do with their thoughts, feelings, goals, etc.\n\nEdit: forgot one, similar to the seems like, but basically you call out what you think they might feel when you say something. \n\nDon't say \"I'm not trying to be an asshole\" instead call it out \"I'm probably gonna be an asshole for saying this\" then say what you want to say. People tend to handle it much better when you call it out ahead of time.",

Whether that is in the form of official employee handbook policies, a written job description, or a list of tasks that need to be completed during their shift. Likely all of the above. Said SOP should be reviewed with each employee and have them sign off on it, which goes in their file. Disciplinary actions, up to and including termination should also be outlined.\n\nThen you can pull them aside and have a conversation. You knew the job. You signed off on it. You didn't do the job.

      "selftext": "Hey Reddit,\n\nThis isn’t a post I ever thought I’d write, but here we are.\n\nA while ago, I lost my job. Not because I was bad at it, not because I didn’t care, and not because I didn’t try. I genuinely gave it my best. I grew, took responsibility, learned fast, and showed up every day trying to do meaningful work.\n\nAnd then it ended. \n\nWhat followed was months of job searching, applications, interviews, silence, rejections, and a slow erosion of confidence. If you’ve been there, you know the feeling: days start blending together, motivation becomes fragile, and at some point you quietly start wondering if maybe you’re just… not that good after all.\nThat part hit me harder than I expected.\nSo instead of staying stuck in that loop, I’ve decided to try something different — and honestly, pretty terrifying.\n\nI’m going to try to build a small company of my own. 💀\n\nI don’t have a safety net. I don’t have funding. I don’t have some romantic “always wanted to be an entrepreneur” backstory. What I do have is a background in digital content, UX, learning design, and product thinking — basically, turning messy ideas into clear, usable things that actually help people. I’ve spent years doing that for organizations. Now I’m going to try doing it for myself.\n\nWith little to no real business experience.\nThis subreddit (and Reddit in general) feels like the right place to do this, because it’s basically the collective brain of the internet — smart, skeptical, supportive when it counts, and very good at calling bullshit. I don’t want to pretend I have it all figured out. I don’t. That’s kind of the point.\n\nMy plan is to share:\nwhat I’m trying to build\nthe decisions I make (good and bad)\nwhat I learn along the way\nthe mistakes, doubts, small wins, and inevitable faceplants\n\nNot as a “guru journey,” but as a real, ongoing process of trying to take responsibility for my own life after it didn’t go the way I planned.\nIf nothing else, I want this to be honest. And if it does work — even a little — I want to be able to say I didn’t give up on myself when it would’ve been easier to do so.\n\nIf you’ve been through layoffs, career detours, or that quiet feeling of “I know I can do good things, why doesn’t life seem to agree?”, you’re not alone. And if you’re curious to follow along, offer advice, criticism, or just lurk… I’d genuinely appreciate having you here.\nI’ll post my first concrete step soon.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nYours truly, \n\nD",

Over many years as a solo handmade business owner, I’ve dealt with a recurring pattern where a small number of customers escalated far beyond normal business interactions.\n\nI’ve experienced insults, verbal abuse, pressure, and threats. When I enforced boundaries or ended business relationships, some customers didn’t disengage — they escalated further. In some cases, they bypassed formal communication channels and used private contact details I never shared, including contacting me outside business hours and sending messages or letters to my private address. That crossed a line from “difficult customers” into something that felt unsafe and deeply distressing.\n\nThe cumulative impact of this has been severe: burnout, anxiety, panic reactions, and a loss of trust and joy in work I once loved. Being the sole person responsible — emotionally, legally, and operationally — meant there was no buffer, no team, no protection layer.\n\nI’m sharing this not to seek validation or business advice, but because talking about it helps me process what happened. Stepping back is not about weakness or giving up — it’s about protecting my mental health after years of repeated boundary violations.\nIf you’ve experienced something similar as a solo founder or creative business owner, you’re not alone.

I had a short small mental break around 6 years ago from a particularly nasty review during the height of busy season. That combined with the customers messages just put me over the edge and I had to take a few days off to lower stress levels. \n\nI say all that to mention this: last year I silenced Etsy seller notifications on my phone. No more cha-ching. No more message notifications. \n\nI now only deal with Etsy when I'm logged in my computer and working (granted that's like 8-14 hours given the day, I'm still a sbo). It's made a huge difference in my mental health and being able to truly have a break from customers. \n\nYou can be grateful for success without being available 24/7 to shoppers.

This was my first time working with a Dubai-based client, and I genuinely went into it excited and optimistic.\n\nWe agreed on a website build for 500$. He paid 250$ upfront, which felt fair. The deal was clear: I’d build the website, and he’d provide his property agency details, content, and images because those were very specific to his business.\nI worked hard and finished the website in about a week. I was honestly proud of how it turned out.\n\nAnd then… everything just stalled.\nI kept following up for the content needed to finalize the site. He’d reply occasionally saying he was travelling abroad. Days turned into weeks. I didn’t want to be pushy, so I stayed polite and patient.\n\nAfter almost 4 weeks, he replied once!!!???\nand then completely disappeared.\nNo replies. No explanation. No “I’m busy.” Nothing.\nThe website is sitting there, almost finished. I’ve spent way more time than I planned, chasing updates instead of working on other projects. The remaining payment never came. And I’m left feeling like I trusted too easily.\n\nWhat hurts isn’t just the money. It’s the feeling of being taken for granted and the time I’ll never get back.\n\nI really want to know.. \nIs this kind of behavior common when dealing with clients?\n\nDo freelancers here take 100% upfront because of this?\n\nHow do you protect yourself from getting stuck like this?\n\nNot trying to attack anyone or stereotype... I just want to learn from this and not repeat the same mistake again.\n\nWould really appreciate advice from anyone who’s been freelancing here or has dealt with similar situations.\nThanks for reading if you've come this far !!

Same goes with web hosting, and many design services from professional businesses.  You pay up front and then they do the work as you are funding the time for an FTE to do the work up front so they can profit and pay the employee.\n\nThis helps prevent issues like this from ever happening again. If you are dealing with clients you don't know you can also have them submit their payment into a holding account, this way if it is over a certain amount they cannot just file a credit card chargeback.  Though it also protects them so if you did not complete the job within the time required they can obtain the prorated refund amount stipulated in the contract they signed.",

Most commercial leases are 3 years, especially for new businesses. Even big franchisees usually sign for 5 years with a renew option. People aren't paying rent on 15-year old leases. And even if their lease was low, their NNN has probably exploded lately. \n\nFew people own a commercial property that they can use AND live in the building. Most of those are professionals with an office on the ground floor and living space upstairs. They're not what you think of when you're talking about a store or gym or convenience store. Maybe a couple of hundred thousand people across all categories of own/work/live in the US. It certainly does nothing to explain businesses justifying high rent.",

While these methods can work, they often require a lot of manual effort. That’s where [WebIeadr](https://webleadr.pages.dev) comes in. A platform where web designers, developers, SEO specialists, and similar professionals can easily find and contact web design leads such as businesses without websites, in just a couple of clicks, along with many other features (check the website to explore all of them)!\n\nWebIeadr offers a one-time, credit-based system: **$12 for 100 business leads**. No subscriptions or recurring fees: pay only when needed. Credits stay in your account and can be used anytime, with options to buy more as needed. For example, if 40 out of 100 leads lack websites and 15 use third-party services (e.g., Facebook), and you secure just a mere 3 clients with basic sales skills, you could earn around $2,000. Your cost? Just $12\n\nThe bottom line is that WebIeadr offers an extremely quick and efficient solution to find web design leads in just a few clicks and **call them in just one click of a button**. From there, all you need to do is apply your sales skills to convince them that having a website is a worthwhile investment for their business.\n\nKnow a web designer, developer, or SEO specialist who could benefit from this? Please share this post with them. They’ll thank you later!",

Whether you're a tradesperson, consultant, freelancer, or growing business, the right number can make you instantly recognisable and easier to reach.\n\n\nWhy it matters:\n- Brand recall: A clean, memorable number sticks in your customer’s mind long after the conversation ends.  \n- Professional image: It signals that you take your business seriously and pay attention to the details.  \n- Customer trust: People are more likely to call a number that feels simple, clear, and intentional.  \n- Marketing impact: Whether on vans, business cards, websites, or ads, a standout number boosts response rates.\n\n\nAt SimpleSimUK.com, we've built a small startup focused on helping UK professionals secure premium, easy‑to‑remember mobile numbers without the usual hassle or inflated prices. It’s a simple idea, but one that genuinely elevates how people perceive your brand.\n\n\nIf you’re building your business, levelling up your personal brand, or just want a number that works as hard as you do, take a look at what we are creating.\n\n\n🌍 https://www.SimpleSimUK.com\n\n📞 +44 7777 787171\n\n\nSmall details build strong brands and your number is one of them.\n\n\n#SimpleSimUK #PersonalBranding #ProfessionalBranding #UKBusiness #SmallBusinessUK #StartupLifeUK #EntrepreneurMindset #BrandIdentity #MemorableNumbers #VIPNumbers #TradesBusiness #ConsultantLife #FreelancerTips #MarketingEssentials #CustomerExperience #StandOutFromTheCrowd",

      "selftext": "Just sharing some tools I find endless value from for new marketers since I see a lot of posts on here about “how do I get started, what should I learn, etc.” \n\nA little about me for context:\n\n* Been marketing 15 years\n* Generalist with undergrad degree in psych (no formal marketing training)\n* Generated over $100M in my career\n* Currently leading a SaaS marketing team, but have worked in CPG too.\n* Have managed teams up to 15 people in size\n\nFeel free to share your tools below!\n\n*OneTab* \\- Honestly this chrome extension changed my life. I’m one of those people who keeps 47 tabs open, then feels stressed about having them open, but also stressed about closing them. OneTab allows me to get a fresh slate every morning without any concern about losing something.\n\n*Klaviyo* \\- Without a doubt, Klaviyo is best marketing email platform for the money. The automation features are unbelievable and the integrations are really solid as well. To me, klaviyo brings big business segmentation and automation to small marketing teams in an easy to use interface with super transparent pricing.\n\n*GA4* \\- K I actually hate GA4, but it is what it is. Learn this thing because you need it, like it or not. It’s the standard.\n\n*Looker* \\- I really love building a visual dashboard for my marketing data. Looker has a learning curve, but if you know GA4 and you’re willing to fuss with the regex and filters, you can build some really powerful and insightful dashboards for marketing channels like email, social, ads, etc. Bonus: you can connect Google search console to pipe in data into an actual digestible format.\n\n*Google ads* \\- This is the first ads channel you should learn inside out. Mainly because it’s the easiest one to find success with (because the technology is much better than any other ads platform, and because search ads capture intent instead of trying to capture interest). Between Google and YouTube, you’ve got access to the majority of the internet with this one platform.\n\n*Asana* \\- Absolutely love asana. The most intuitive and powerful project management system (also FREE). I’ve tried jira, trello, Monday, notion, and clickup and they are all lackluster compared to asana when it comes to marketing project management. The functional advantages of subtasks, customizable tags, different options for views, messages and comments, attachments… this is the one system that actually works.\n\n*Ryze AI* \\- If you're managing multiple ad accounts, this saves hours. Monitors everything, generates reports across all accounts at once, and can auto-apply fixes. I was manually checking each account every morning like an idiot before this.\n\n*Noun project* \\- There are so many underwhelming stock image sites. I really love this site. Most of my marketing graphics are either using icons or photos and noun project has the best selection for the best price, hands down. Also love that you can customize icons.\n\n*Google slides &amp; Google sheets* \\- Don’t roll your eyes because most marketers I’ve worked with aren’t using half of the functionality these free tools offer. Namely, the ability to create a beautiful strategy deck that shows you thought about something and distilled it into a usable format for leadership and your team. But things like pivots, well made chart visuals, data formatting formulas, etc are all underutilized. Also, I’d rather use sidewalk chalk than PowerPoint and excel.\n\n*Apollo io* \\- Cold emails are tough, but I think for the money you can’t beat Apollo. It pulls in the stuff you typically have to pay a ton for like a huge database of contacts, recordable calls with transcripts and snippets, etc for a flat affordable monthly rate. Basically a mashup of zoominfo and gong for a fraction of the price of both. I will say: the data dashboards are absolutely horrible. Like unusable.\n\n*Loom* \\- Can’t tell you how helpful it is for async communication and documentation to just record my screen while I’m taking and send it to someone. Hidden gem: AI transcription is a nice feature. These also work for recording product demos.\n\n*ChatGPT* \\- Yeah we get it, AI is a thing and some of us hate it and some of us love it. Here’s how I use this one: organizing a mess of notes into a coherent doc, drafting blog posts, generating customer avatars that I can ask questions, preparing for job interviews, negative keyword lists, and competitive analysis. There is a really good episode of Paid Search Podcast called “talking to your data” that has cool ideas for parsing Google ads data with chatgpt as well. You just have to understand: 90% of the copy and ideas you get from ChatGPT is unusable trash. But the 10% is well worth it.\n\n*Reddit* \\- lol. I mean, every time I have a question I can’t find an answer to, I come here and ask, and I get answers. Sometimes on the most niche things. Aside from that, it’s a fantastic listening tool. Jump into a forum and just look at what people say about the problem your business solves, your competitors, you, etc.\n\n*TinyPNG* \\- Throughout my career, it’s been a common theme that I get an image from a designer for an email and it’s like 4.5mb. I love the emphasis on quality… but I’m not going to bog my email down with that. Tinypng is free and almost always cranks the image down to a few KB without making it look like shit.\n\n*LinkedIn* \\- I received 3 job offers in one month because I built a solid personal brand before I started looking for my most recent role. Yes, your connections (quantity and quality) do matter. Yes, it matters if you post on there actively. Additionally, it’s (slightly) easier for me to book demos and spread awareness around whatever brand I’m working on. I don’t recommend premium or sales nav. No added value IMO.\n\nThose are the main ones. What about you? Feel free to reach out if you have any doubts and DM me!",
