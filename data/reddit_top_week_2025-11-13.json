      "selftext": "Real talk, podcasting doesn’t get enough credit as a side hustle. Everyone’s chasing dropshipping or freelancing, but a simple niche podcast can actually stack up fast if you’re consistent.\n\nI started mine talking about random stuff I was already into, didn’t expect much, but it picked up once I started uploading to Spotify, YouTube, and a few other platforms. Between listener support, affiliate plugs, and platform monetization, it turned into a decent passive stream.\n\nIf you’ve got something to say (or even just a hobby you rant about with friends), record it. You don’t need crazy gear either (I even started recording using my crappy Blackshark gaming headphone and Spotify Creators hosting.) \n\nAnyway, I'm on my 3rd month of earning over $500 a month. Not enough to pay all the bills, but it does help w groceries and other random expenses\n\nEdit: Make sure to know that spending a bit on good rigs and equipments like reapers shures, is always bound to happen. Most importantly, you'll make the bank on your podcast hosting platform (in my case is Castos)",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone! I wanna share my success story: I run a small coffee shop in a college neighborhood and last Black Friday, instead of doing the usual one-day discount madness, I tried s a week-long “stamp card” promo. Each visit earned a stamp, and after five stamps, you’d get a limited Y2K-style mug and a free drink.\n\nThe idea was just to keep people coming back instead of rushing in for one deal. And it actually worked! The week’s sales were up about 40% compared to the year before, and we handed out around 200 mugs to regulars.\n\nHere’s where it gets funny: I totally underestimated how much people would love that mug. It was this simple lime-green thing with pixel fonts and a tiny. I ordered 250 from a local printer thinking I’d have leftovers for months. They were gone in four days.\n\nThen came the DMs. People started asking if they could buy the mug online students, locals who missed the promo, even a few who moved out of town. So in December, I put up the remaining 50 mugs for $18 each on our website, and they sold out overnight.\n\nThis spring, I did a second run of 300 mugs at $22 each then and soft-launched it on our coffee shop’s Instagram. I didn’t even push it that hard, just a few story posts and a reel showing the design process. That batch cleared in about three weeks, bringing in roughly $5.4k in sales and around $2.3k in profit after costs.\n\nNow it’s basically a mini side hustle. I’m planning to do limited drops every season. I don’t want to become a full merch brand, but it’s wild how one small promo reward turned into something that helps cover rent on slower months and I'm so so happy to have made it work, idk if i'd have been able to keep the coffee shop open without the exta boost\n\nSo yeah, mind blowing how a side hustle can actually work!",

It's really easy to get certified--just follow their instructions. It helps if you already have some sample videos you can post, but you could also grab something from around your house and make a quick video. My experience has been that you have to do gifted collabs or $5 jobs to get your ratings up before anyone will hire you for anything else. And for my $5 jobs, I've had to purchase the products up front ($48 and $40) and then get reimbursed at the end. Those were for makeup products I use and love, so I didn't mind buying them. \n\n**Insense**: There are a lot of gifted collabs on this app too, but you can also apply for any job on the site. I just did a gifted collab TikTok shop video for a face mask, and the company liked my video and has offered me two jobs at $150 per video. $150 isn't a ton, but I think I've made maybe $20 on TikTok Shop in the last month, so I'll take it lol.\n\n**Billo** is another I hear good things about, but haven't used yet. You have to upload an introduction video before it will let you see any of the available jobs and apply, and I haven't done that yet.\n\n**Kale** also looks interesting--you do \"missions\" for the brand, and the pay for those seems decent.\n\nYou might want to get a portfolio put together, because brands always seem to ask for it. I took a UCG for beginners course online that was really helpful, but all that info is probably out there for free too.",

One reader &gt; none.\n8. The only growth hack is showing up daily.\n9. I overthink subject lines more than anything.\n10. People open *stories*, not “tips.”\n11. Personal beats perfect.\n12. 80% of what you write will suck — publish anyway.\n13. Editing is optional when you’re being honest.\n14. Replies &gt; stats.\n15. You can sell nothing and still build something valuable.\n16. Failure stories connect more than success stories.\n17. The best lines come when you’re tired and done pretending.\n18. Posting to 5 platforms a day is overrated.\n19. Writing forces clarity.\n20. “Keep going” is cliché — but it’s the only rule that works.\n21. One sentence can change someone’s day.\n22. Chaos produces good writing if you let it.\n23. Every platform feels dead until something hits.\n24. The dopamine from new subs fades quick.\n25. You’ll want to quit every week.\n26. Every post feels pointless until someone says it helped them.\n27. AI can fix grammar but never voice.\n28. You find your niche by writing, not by planning.\n29. Boring days still deserve words.\n30. I refresh my sub count way too often.\n31. Family keeps me grounded when I spiral about growth.\n32. I owe everything to the habit, not the ideas.\n33. Money doesn’t make writing easier.\n34. Selling without selling feels better.\n35. Focusing on one thing beats chasing ten.\n36. Repetition *is* marketing.\n37. You build trust just by showing up.\n38. People buy consistency, not hype.\n39. I still don’t know what I’m doing — and that’s fine.\n40. Micro-wins compound.\n41. You can have a bad day and still hit publish.\n42. The right reader always finds you.\n43. Writing = therapy in public.\n44. Momentum &gt; speed.\n45. Authentic &gt; viral.\n46. Every word is a rep.\n47. You only learn what works *after* pressing send.\n48. A small audience is a secret weapon.\n49. The only real goal: write again tomorrow.\n50. 50 days in — still just getting started.",

If you ever go to the doctor to get blood drawn or pee in a cup or need a Covid test, I’m the one who does the testing. \n\nBut I had to pay for the degree, and just one job wasn’t going to make that happen quickly. Then I found out just how many people in healthcare work on call or per diem at other hospitals or clinics. \n\nA lot of this is made possible because lots of healthcare schedules are pretty unorthodox too. It’s not unusual to run across people who work 3 12 hour shifts a week, 4 10 hour shifts a week, and my personal favorite, which I’m currently doing, is working 7 10 hour days in a row, then getting every other week off. I get paid for full time but basically only work half the year. And while it’s only an average of 35 hours a week, I get paid a 14% differential, so I’m basically being paid as though I’m working 80 hours. \n\nBecause I have every other week off, and because I live in an area with lots of hospitals, it was easy to find a second job in my same industry at a different hospital, doing basically the exact same thing. I’m “on call” so I’m the person who comes in if someone needs a vacation and they don’t have enough full time staff to cover, or if someone is out sick. They work around my FT job, and I can turn down shifts. \n\nBut for the past 3 years, I’ve worked every other week and picked up 2-3 days during my off weeks at my other job. It averages out to working about 10 days during a 14 day period, which is what most people do working 9-5 M-F. Granted, I work more hours in a day, and I work a lot of nights, weekends, and holidays, but I paid off my student loans in 2 years and maxed out my retirement contributions for the past 2 years. I’m only sorry I didn’t learn about this scheme sooner.",

      "selftext": "Everybody's need for a side hustle is different. \n\nBy need, I mean literally how much you need in order to:\n\n1. Consider the side hustle worthy of building it\n2. Consider the side hustle worthy of maintaining it \n3. Consider the side hustle worthy of growing it\n\nSomeone who sells a $1 product but needs $1,000 a month in net profit, without a way to reliably get customers, will most likely give up before they ever reach their goal. \n\nThat's why you see so many \"\\[insert side hustle\\] is a scam!\" posts. They tend to be those looking for a \"plug and play\" solution when there aren't any outside maybe opening a franchise (and even then market conditions could change your approach). \n\nSo how do you escape that trap? Here's a simple three-step framework: \n\n1. Ask higher-quality questions. By \"higher-quality\", I mean specific, tailored to your situation, and requiring input that's deeper than what a base prompt ChatGPT reply can give you. \"What's the best side hustle...\" is bad. \"What's the best side hustle for college students\" is better. \"What's the best side hustle for college students in a pre-med curriculum I can start for under $100\" is good. \"What are side hustle ideas for college students in a pre-med curriculum I can start for under $100 and only requires 1-3 hours a week to maintain\" is golden. Why? Because the higher-quality the input you give, the higher-quality output you'll receive.  \n2. Once you have 3-5 ideas that seem feasible, get a better understanding of what you need and then pair that need with the side hustle ideas that reasonably can get you there in a realistic time frame. For example, if you need $1,000 a month and sell a product/service for $100, all you need is 10 customers and you've met it. Simple, right? \n3. Do your own research. Reverse engineer someone whose already making the kind of money you want to make. The internet makes this pretty easy to do, especially if that person is selling on a public-facing platform like Upwork, Fiverr, Etsy, or eBay - you can reasonably guesstimate all-time/monthly income based on the available metrics (and in some cases if you pony up for a month of a paid analytics tracker, you can dive even deeper into those details). From that information, you can create your own offer, model if after the winners, and then tweak it to better serve an audience that you would be part of if you'd found it first.  \n\nNow, here's the kicker: what if you do all three of these steps AND THEN ask a question based on what you've already done? You will likely get replies that are so well articulated, it'll feel like you're trying on a tailor-made suit for the first time - the answers will fit you, and only you, and you'll be able to get even more insight (while being able to easily spot those who have no real-world understanding of what you asked for, and then can brush them off). \n\nHope this helps.

I have my masters in I/O Psychology and a background in HR, but I feel like my skills outside of that are…nonexistent. \n\nSince I’m pregnant, I know it’s not super feasible for me to find a job right now and still be able to afford childcare with this current job market. Im still trying but coming up short. My husband can afford most of the bills on his income but it will be tight and I’m hoping to at least help with groceries and expenses for the baby. \n\nHere are a few things about me:\n- I have a creative spirit but not the best at design. I can sometimes make a good template but I have no idea how to create designs otherwise (willing to learn if this is viable)\n- I’ve tried fiverr but I just am not sure what to sell on there and I don’t have a create copy of my work\n- I’m still too inexperienced to be a consultant in such a saturated field. Though, I’d love to be and again, not sure how. I’ve even looked into this one.\n- uber and doordash aren’t options for me…mostly due to safety concerns and anxiety\n- I also have no idea how to make a following for affiliate marketing or to make money from social media. I’m not sure what my content would be and the thought of getting in front of a camera gives me the ick\n- I love to critique and judge things, lol. Not sure if there’s a side hustle for that.\n- I love teaching and giving advice, but I don’t know where to start there since I can’t find a job doing this \n- I’ve considered selling some hr related templates on etsy but the set up fee is holding me back \n- I like to read? Anything here?\n- really not sure I have any special talents tbh \n",

      "selftext": "Been wanting to start something for a while but kept getting stuck in the \"idea phase\" where I'd overthink everything and never actually build anything.\n\nRealized the main blocker was cost and time... like if I'm gonna invest $10k and 6 months into something I better be SURE it'll work right? Which of course means you never start.\n\nThen I found out you can use AI to build apps now? Like functional ones not just prototypes. Decided to test it by building 3 completely different ideas quickly and seeing what got any traction.\n\nIdea 1: simple meal planning app for people with specific dietary restrictions (i have celiac). Built basic version in 4 days, sent to 20 people in a facebook group. Got feedback that the recipe database was too small and people wanted grocery list export.\n\nIdea 2: habit tracker but specifically for building creative habits (writing, drawing, music practice). Took 3 days to build. Shared on reddit. People liked it but said there are already too many habit trackers and this wasn't different enough.\n\nIdea 3: local event discovery app for my city. Built in 5 days. Showed to friends. Immediately learned that people just use instagram and facebook for this already and wouldn't download another app.\n\nWhat I learned: all 3 ideas seemed good in my head. NONE of them were actually wanted in their current form. But I learned that in 2 weeks for under $100 instead of wasting months and thousands of dollars.\n\nNow I'm iterating on idea 1 based on feedback (bigger recipe database, grocery integration). Might not work but at least I'm testing real things vs just thinking about them.\n\nUsed vibecode for the builds cause I'm not technical and it lets you test stuff on your phone easily. There are other tools too.\n\nPoint is you can validate ideas now without massive investment. Just build a rough version, show 20-30 people, get real feedback, pivot or kill it.\n\nAnyone else testing ideas this way or am I late to this approach?",

With one Reddit post, in under 2 weeks, I’ve had 6 customers for a total of 13 hours. People have been extremely generous paying anywhere from $25 to $40 an hour so far! \n\nNot a lot of hours yet, but very helpful when in need and I only needed a rake, bicycle, and cellphone to do it. \n\nDepending where you live, every season has work people will often pay well for. Here in Canada snow shovelling is a big one after the leaf raking is over. Anyone else try similar ideas?\n\nGood luck! 💵💰",

Not talking about paying for courses because I'm broke lol but like things where you can learn and maybe make a little money at the same time. Saw someone mention getting paid to complete surveys but that seems like pennies. Others talk about learning coding through freelance projects but that's way above my skill level right now. I'm specifically interested in learning about personal finance and investing since I literally know nothing about that stuff but I like it. Just seems like most educational content either costs too much money or youtube videos that put me to sleep. Does anything actually exist where you actually learn practical skills for free?

Assisting homeowners with landscaping can pay $25 an hour. Babysitting dogs or walking them is $25 per dog per day. Elderly care (getting the mail, fixing them dinner) can be $30-50 per visit. Sooooo many options.\n\n\nBut don't stop there. You are in School? Then position yourself to apply your skills in more than one industry.\n\n\nMe, for example. I got a Bachelor's of Science. While in college, I tutored local high school kids in math. And I took Pre-med classes. Combining these skills let me bounce around after school in many different positions.\n\n\nToday, my main job in a hospital pays $30/HR and my side job tutoring college students pays $65-85 per hour. When I decide not to have a life, I can clear $10k in a month. Right now, though, Im doing less so I can have more time with my girlfriend. Anyway, think ahead and give yourself options.\n\n\nONE LAST THING. If possible, continue to live with Mom and Dad as long as you can. That allowed me to save for a house, which you can rent for an additional stream of income.",

I’ve been trying to take a 50% deposit upfront, but not everyone is willing to. It’s hard to keep track, especially with some clients taking weeks to pay. Last month I completely forgot to invoice a customer, just totally spaced on it until they texted me asking for their invoice.\n\nAlso getting leads from nextdoor and facebook but half of them ghost after I send estimates. Takes me a day or two to respond usually because I'm at my day job. Had someone ask for a quote on replacing their deck boards last week, sent it that evening, they went with someone else the next morning.\n\nMy system right now is basically google sheets and hoping I remember everything, it's clearly not working anymore as I'm getting busier.\n\nWhat are you guys using to stay organized with this stuff?",

      "selftext": "Hey all, I'm needing some help with brainstorming ideas for extra income, ideally relatively quickly. I currently have a full time 40 hour a week job. It's normally Monday-Friday, 9-5, but some days I may have to work late, take evening calls, or take calls during the day on weekends. Because of that, I need a fairly flexible side hustle. My full time job absolutely comes first, every time. The good news is that I often have free time during my work day where I can't leave the building, but can work on personal projects as long as I have my regular work done. \n\nWhile I can pay all my bills with my current job, there's not much left over for me. I'm barely managing to have enough to get my medications, and I'm currently in physical therapy that I'm not sure how I'm going to pay for. That also means there's not really money for Christmas, or buying myself new clothes when I need them for work, vehicle repairs, helping my spouse with the grocery bill, etc. I also really want to work on paying off my credit card debts from when I was going through an exceptionally hard time.\n\nI tried Biolife and they could only get a good vein in one arm so they put me on deferral. I get one more try to see if they can stick me but after that it's a permanent deferral to my understanding. My right arm has a great vein, my left arm doesn't.\n\nMy car insurance will go up 100$ a month to cover me if I do something like Doordash, Instacart, or UberEats. I'm concerned that I won't be able to make enough to make it worth it after the insurance and gas. But I've also never done any freelance food delivery before, so maybe I'm selling short how much I'll make from that. If you could share your experience from that, it might help reassure me. I'm lucky that I'm in a major metro area, so I don't think I'd be short on work necessarily.\n\nI'm getting a seasonal job that I can work once a week at a place I've worked before. It's a little retail shop and fairly low-stress other than how much I have to be on my feet. Unfortunately, that'll only add another 100$ a week, give or take depending on exactly how much they schedule me. \n\nI'm working on opening an Etsy shop. I'm fairly creative and crafty and originally went to school for graphic design. I'm planning to do some reselling of antiques, keepsakes, limited edition items, and Youtuber merch that my spouse no longer wants. I'm also planning on selling door hangers (think \"do not open\"), pin back buttons, coasters, and kandi bracelets. My spouse will also be working with me to offer tarot readings and spell jars among other witchy things, as they have a lot of experience in those things. \n\nWould doing food delivery be worth it? Are there any other options that I'm not seeing? I know there are technically game/survey apps that pay that I could do at work when I'm not busy, but they pay so little or take so long to get paid that I'm not sure it would be worth my time.",

      "selftext": "hey everyone, ive been lurking this sub and I feel like I should share my passive income story. I have no referral link or anything to shill, just purely wanting to share what worked for me.\n\nI defintiely did not grow up or have an affluent life. It was actually quite the opposite. However, I was fortunate enough to be able to live with my very kind and caring parents for the the first half of my college life. \n\nI worked at a grocery store and made minimum wage. However I managed to save $1,000 and by the advice of my friend, I put all of it into an ETF (which is a way to track an index, or basket of stocks) called “VOO”, which tracks the S&amp;P 500. Basically it’s the top 500 companies in the US is the benchmark for safe but risk appropriate investing. Basically, if it fails, you have bigger issues to worry about than money in your life.\n\nBasically, I saved $75 every week and would just have it automatically deposit and purchase more VOO. I started this around 2015/2016ish.\n\nFastforward 10 years later, and I officially crossed $100,000 in gains (I’ve been looking forward to this day for so long!!). I literally just started with $1,000 in VOO, and autoset $75 to deposit and purchase VOO every week with my very tiny wages, and I managed to cross the $100k mark at a relatively young age.\n\n  \nThis, I feel like, was true passive income as I genuinely forgot about it for months and it had almost no effect on my life. I genuinely completely forgot about it at points in time, and didn’t even know when the market was going down (or higher!). I would periodically just check maybe once a month. \n\nThe point of this post is definitely NOT to brag. in fact, there’s probably way more people doing better than me. But I just wanted to show everyone that there ARE easy ways to make passive income, even with a minimum wage like me!",

I had this tiny hobby account where I posted aesthetic desk setups and productivity stuff I found online. One post blew up out of nowhere, and followers started rolling in. Then someone DMed me asking if I could post their product on my story and offered $20. That was my “wait… people actually pay for this??” moment.\n\n\n\nI got curious and made a few more accounts in different niches, like quotes, lifestyle, cozy home decor, that kind of stuff. Nothing huge, but I started noticing patterns: which content got engagement, what time posts hit best, and what types of followers brands were after.\n\n\n\nEventually, I teamed up with two friends to handle more pages. I thought it'd make things easier, but managing 20+ accounts quickly turned into chaos: constant logins/logouts, getting flagged as bots, and even losing accounts because Instagram thought we were sketchy. On top of that, I started worrying about losing control over these accounts, since we were sharing passwords, any single leak could put all my accounts and earnings at risk. So I needed a way to keep full control over my own accounts without compromising teamwork.\n\n\n\nThat's when I got smarter about the setup. My friends and I used Canva for posts (none of us were Photoshop pros), Later for scheduling, CapCut and InShot for Reels, and AdsPower to keep everything separated. It helped a lot with security, no more device confusion or accidental cross-logins, and the teamwork feature let me assign roles and permissions without having to share logins directly.\n\n\n\nI wouldn’t call it “passive” in the beginning cuz it was a grind. But once things were set up, a lot started running on autopilot. Some of our old pages still bring in cash from story promos, affiliate links, or the occasional account sale to someone who wants a head start.\n\n\n\nHere’s what I’ve learned:\n\n• “Soft” niches (quotes, lifestyle, cute pets, productivity) are way easier to grow and monetize than most people think.\n\n• Consistency &gt; creativity when you’re starting out.\n\n• And seriously, once you scale, security and organization are everything.\n\n\n\nIt’s not a get-rich-quick thing, but it’s been a solid little side income for something that started as me just posting random aesthetic pics in my free time.",

But by being very consistent with publishing while niching down heavily you can still be somewhat successful. At my time it was actionable reports and guides for local service providers wanting to improve parts of their business. Everybody doing KDP should definetly go with their promo offerings and KDP Unlimited, expand to other platforms and utilize deal platforms for more exposure. If it's educational stuff, it always made sense to publish some sort of series that handles different parts and processes towards some goal. That stuff that can be combined into nice bundles that offer real value. Also people love unexpected freebies. Link inside your publications to video content, tools and printables that complement your content whenever you see fit. Give your readers something to implement/work on after consuming your stuff so that they benefit from your advice as fast as possible. Also ask for reviews, without reviews there are no sales, especially on Amazon. To get started give your publications away for free in exchange for reviews. That makes a huge difference. It's absolutely necessary to get some proof from real people. My last point: Spend time on your branding and establish as many touchpoints as possible. When someone wants to be educated by a brand, he should find a decent first page communicating that he's in the right place with you when googling your brand name. Good luck to everybody trying. Make it work.",

          "body": "For me a decent side hustle I've been doing is looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than any initial cost. It's a form of arbitrage, and it can make you an extra couple hundred each month. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives those offers higher, creating more opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how it works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

Since your best sellers are educational workbooks, I would treat this less like single titles and more like a structured learning path. Build clear series progression, bundle volumes, and include lightweight printables and short videos via links inside the books. Add a simple in‑book call to action to capture email and deliver a companion resource; reviews follow more easily when readers feel they got immediate, practical wins.\n\nThe niche is crowded, but consistency plus positioning still compounds. Aim for a distinct pedagogical angle and repeatable format, then price test across KDP Select promos while tracking KU reads versus sales. Repurpose content for adjacent channels like Etsy for printables and Gumroad for digital packs, and refresh cover design and branding so your catalog signals coherence. On the affiliate and digital product side, focus on offers that deepen the same audience outcome, not generic monetization.\n\nOne caution: lists of survey apps and crypto casinos tend to be noisy and low‑trust. Your time is better spent tightening a workbook‑to‑email‑to‑bundle funnel and measuring how many readers progress to your higher‑value sets. That is where defensibility lives.",

However it surprised me because I ended up getting email notifications that I would have commission of $50 for a month, and then it slowly started ramping up to $80-$90ish, and now it’s running in the low to mid hundreds. This really surprised me but I kid you guys not I genuinely (almost) forgot about my novel and it’s now pulling me a few hundred a month completely “passive”. Like, I do zero promotion or any effort for it, but it’s somehow being recommended to people in the marketplace.\n\ncrazy how sometimes these things work out in the strangest ways, but that just shows that earning passive income isn’t always through an obvious path… \n\nhope this inspires anyone else. just thought I’d share lol ",

Some of my best passive income successes in the past have been from dipping my spoon into the broader market, but I’d be hesitant to lean into it right now given the number of states that are enacting ID laws for accessing porn sites, which might as well be a porn ban. Likewise, at this point, there’s very little to stop the Project 2025 vision of making porn illegal within the next year a reality, and I would not be at all surprised if any businesses considered to be abetting the distribution of pornography to be held liable as well.\n \nSo, ignoring any moral objections you may have, strictly in terms of what’s going to be best for your business over the next three years or more, I don’t think leaning into it is the way. Maybe ten years ago but not in this budding dystopia we’re rolling into. If it were me, I’d monitor them to make sure they aren’t promoting or fronting for some truly rancid stuff, but leaning towards cutting quick if their presence is providing little relative benefit or limiting growth. Meanwhile I’d be reviewing and updating terms and user agreements to course correct.",

Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them.

      "selftext": "Hey  , I've been lurking here for a while reading all your stories, and they inspired me to share mine. Like a lot of you, I have a full-time gig as a handyman – tools, nails, long days – and my girlfriend's hustling as a real estate agent. Bills add up quick, so we needed something extra without adding more grind.\n\nShe's a baking wizard: pastries, cakes, breads that make the whole place smell incredible (and pack on the pounds for me). We thought, why not flip that into cash? Signed up for Amazon Affiliates – free, approved fast. She started posting in Facebook cooking groups: simple recipes with everyday ingredients, plus shoutouts to tools she actually uses, like a solid mixer or heat-retaining pan. Affiliate links fit right in, totally natural, no spammy vibes.\n\nNow she's in 37 groups. To keep it efficient (her job's non-stop), she uses Facebook™ Groups Bulk Poster &amp; Scheduler | Auto Post. It's a Chrome extension – install it, connect your Facebook, select your groups, draft posts with pics or links, and schedule them to drop automatically. What it does: Handles bulk posting so no manual copy-paste drudgery, schedules ahead for consistency, avoids spam flags by posting natively, and even has analytics to track what's clicking. Benefits? Saves hours weekly, lets you focus on content over logistics, affordable (free trial, one-time buy I think), and keeps everything compliant with FB rules.\n\nI jumped in too – 21 handyman/DIY groups, sharing real tips on tools like versatile drills or long-lasting paints, with links woven in. We do 3 posts each per week, always prioritizing value so it's helpful, not salesy.\n\nThe payoff: Month 1 hit $1,100 net. Month 2 jumped to $1,950. Month 3's rolling strong. It's not overnight riches, but real extra dough from stuff we love, zero big upfront costs.\n\nWhat worked for us:\n\n* Niche down to what you know – authenticity shines.\n* Hunt for relevant FB groups (search \"your hobby + group\") and join a bunch.\n* Amazon Affiliates is newbie-friendly; start tracking clicks early.\n* A scheduler like this one scales it without extra sweat – just check platform rules.\n\nNot claiming it's fully passive yet (upfront setup took effort), but it's getting there. Anyone else crushing it with affiliates in groups?",

          "body": "Baking and handyman tips are concrete, and posting into relevant groups with useful content explains the early traction. The one place I would tighten is distribution risk and trust. Many groups either block links or quietly throttle anything that looks promotional, so your strategy benefits from a content-first flow: post the recipe or tool walkthrough natively, then invite readers to a short, non-commercial landing page that expands the guide and transparently discloses affiliate relationships. That tends to pass mod scrutiny and builds credibility.\n\nOperationally, treat this like a simple funnel: group post to educational landing page, optional email capture for “one new recipe or tool breakdown per week,” then affiliate links inside longer-form content. Use cohorts to test cadence and formats, for example imagery first vs step-by-step text, and rotate product placements rather than repeating the same mixer or drill. Track by group, not just total clicks, and watch for account health signals if you use schedulers. If a group bans links, keep the value in-post and move the CTA to “searchable title” plus brand page.\n\nKeep the posting helpful and native, move the actual selling to a transparent, well-structured hub, and let analytics guide which groups and content formats compound.",

Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them.

Try gig work and don't go for weird online stuff most of it is a trap and many steal information. \nBut 16 is the perfect age to do the following jobs that will also be useful long-term and can easily help build skills:\n1) Caretaking- so babysitting, nanny work, lawn care or weed removal, pet-sitting \nEasy to start up and word of mouth finds clients faster than paying for websites and so on. Once one neighbor knows and you do a good job they will definitely tell others. You can also make really good money because caretakers in most places don't make less than $20 an hour depending on services \n\n2) Lifeguarding or camp counselor - you are old enough that almost any YMCA will take you and you could get paid and trained in things like CPR and first aid. Most places help pay for the certifications, if not sometimes family members don't mind helping pay for the certifications if it means a good job and someone in the house knowing emergency care\n\n3)Thrifting resale. Tons of people do it and if you study up or have a knack for fashion or a closet to clear out. Ask family and friends if anyone needs help with garage sales or putting up decorations. Find a need and fill it for a price. \n\n4) nothing gets you rich quick without a consequence in this world. You have to invest time and effort. Just keep trying to find what works for you!

          "body": "Hot take: instead of trying to hustle through life, focus your energy on acquiring skills and producing value. At 16, you’re not in a position to “get money for free” as passive income always seems to suggest. The only way that passive income works, if it’s not scamming other people, is if the thing you’re selling is providing a huge longterm benefit. Such a thing usually requires large investments, years of work, etc. If you could have that at 16, everybody would do it and the value would quickly diminish.\n\nAlso, imo if you get a regular brain dead job and just save that money to invest it in financial products, you’ll be way better off than trying any sort of business. Especially at your age, all investors will tell you: the biggest and safest factor is time, they all wish they’d started saving earlier.",

Its better for you to explore your own world first before seeking help from others world view. If you give up that easily and ask for help immediately, youre never going to grow.

Do that for as long as you can. You will be so far ahead of the game then most of us. The sucky part is that this is the slow amd steady approach and trusting on compounding interest.

That's not enough time to try even one way for long enough (as in, to get good enough at it).\n\nWhat you are experiencing is the valuable lesson of failure, one that every entrepreneur will have to face in their life. It comes with the even more valuable lesson of dealing with frustration and anxiety, two key skills in business.\n\nMy pieces of advice are: focus on one thing and go all in; connect with people that know how to do that thing better than you do and learn as much as you can from them; partner up with people whose skills compliment your own.\n\nFor instance, I'm a tax lawyer. I learned my core skill through 10 years of service in big law. After I left, I partnered up with another lawyer that is very good at tax litigation, an auditor and a CPA to be able to deliver the complete service. We have another partner whose focus is strictly corporate sales and a consultant for business intelligence and AI. We're looking for a specialist in digital marketing right now, since our strategy is in need of a digital marketplace wiz.\n\nGoing at business alone, with no/low capital and no skills is the recipe for failure on top of which \"get rich scheme\" internet bozos thrive of.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been working online for over 10 years, and during this time, I’ve noticed a clear pattern among people who never make any real money — it almost always comes down to their mindset.\n\nHere are 7 types of people who almost never make money online (and why):\n\n# ‍1. The Information Collectors\n\nThey love learning, but never apply anything. They watch every YouTube video, download every freebie, and maybe even buy a few courses — but never actually finish or implement them.\n\n**The Problem:** They confuse learning with doing.\n\n**Fix:** Pick *one* business model and take consistent action on it for 90 days — no switching.\n\n# 2. The Shiny Object Chasers\n\nThey jump from one idea to another. One week it’s Amazon KDP, next week it’s affiliate marketing, then dropshipping, then AI prompts…\n\n**The Problem:** They’re always chasing what looks easiest or newest.\n\n**Fix:** Commit to *one* model until you’re profitable. Every business works — if *you* work it.\n\n# 3. The “No-Time” Excusers\n\nThey always say, “I don’t have time.” Yet they spend hours scrolling social media or binge-watching Netflix.\n\n**The Problem:** They underestimate what they can do in 1 focused hour per day.\n\n**Fix:** Schedule non-negotiable work blocks. Even 45 minutes daily compounds massively over a year.\n\n# 4. The Freebie Hunters\n\nThey refuse to invest a dollar. They want to build a business using only free tools and free info.\n\n**The Problem:** When you get something for free, you don’t value it.\n\n**Fix:** Be willing to invest — in tools, learning, and systems that save time or accelerate results.\n\n# 5. The Fearful Perfectionists\n\nThey wait for everything to be perfect before launching. Whether it’s a blog, product, or YouTube channel — they keep editing, tweaking, and never publishing.\n\n**The Problem:** Perfectionism is procrastination in disguise.\n\n**Fix:** Launch messy. Improve as you go. The market teaches faster than theory.\n\n# 6. The Overthinkers\n\nThey analyze everything to death. They spend weeks deciding on a niche or a logo instead of creating something.\n\n**The Problem:** They’re paralyzed by too many “what ifs.”\n\n**Fix:** Make quick decision, and take small actions. You can’t steer a parked car — start moving and refine as you go.\n\n# 7. The Instant Gratification Seekers\n\nThey expect quick money. If they don’t see results in 2 weeks, they quit and call it a scam. \n\n**The Problem:** They treat online business like a lottery, not a long-term skill.\n\n**Fix:** Think in *years*, not weeks. The internet rewards those who stick around long enough to learn what works.\n\nHave you ever caught yourself stuck in one of these traps?",

Or if your digital project develops and it becomes to integrate extensions or modules, but you did not natively think of it to work with modules you find yourself in complications: changing the heart of your system is unthinkable without a significant investment; generally the pseudo solutions found end up harming the user experience (the first and biggest example that comes to mind is dear Windoys which has only added layer upon layer of updates, each of which weighs down the OS and which comes with its share of flaws and finally security patches).\n\nMost of the people involved don't do it because their main concern is making money, when it should be delivering a quality service/product.\nAnd fortunately, not all solution creators are driven by their lack of money.\n\nSo I would say that we have to find a happy medium, the points you put forward are fair but we should not completely reject them.\nSomeone who has not done enough research, who is not a perfectionist, will perhaps have customers interested in the problem he promises to solve but will end up disappointed by the lack of quality.",

          "body": "I have been using the Vibecode app for a bit, so here is a straight answer.\nVibecode is more than a UI mockup tool. It generates actual mobile apps using React Native and Expo under the hood, and you can run them on your phone, not just click through static screens.\nI built a small mobile MVP with it that had email based login, saved user data, simple logic like tracking streaks and progress, and a couple of external API calls with basic tracking. That was enough to share the app with real users and collect feedback. All of that was done inside Vibecode without opening a traditional code editor.\nFrom what I have seen, it does well when your app is fairly straightforward. Things like auth, basic CRUD, simple conditions, and a few APIs are very doable. When you start asking for more unusual or complex workflows, it takes more effort to get what you want, and it helps a lot if you already understand how apps and data flows work.\nSo to answer the original question in practical terms:\nYes, Vibecode can build a real, functional mobile app, not just a visual prototype. It is a solid option if you want to get an MVP on a phone quickly and see how users react. If the app grows and you need heavy custom logic or long term maintainability, you will probably end up refining the generated code or bringing in a more traditional setup later, but that is a next step, not a blocker for getting started.",

Launches fast. The only issue I have is that edge cases and hyper custom logic sometimes needs tweaking after the app generates it, but that's honestly expected... You're not locked into what it outputs though as you can export and edit if needed.\n\nFor an MVP? Really freakin' solid. You'll have something real in days. The question is whether you want to spend time customizing stuff after or if the initial build is 80% of what you need anyway. You can then use vibe coders like Claude or Gemini Pro (hell, even GPT5 is decent) to finish the rest. \n\nBiggest thing I'd say is, try it for your specific use case first. Some app ideas are perfect for AI builders, others need custom development. But you'll know pretty quick once you start building.\n\nHope that helps.",

That was the first time I felt like my time and effort turned into something.\n\nThere were still problems. Lots of visitors, not a lot of purchases. I adjusted prices, rewrote product descriptions, improved images, and tried different platforms. It took a few rounds to get things right. Time was also limited since I had a full-time job. Nights and weekends were all I had, and burnout hit me more than once. The costs added up too. Tools, ads, subscriptions, product handling. Small stuff stacks up.\n\nHere’s what I learned:\n\n1.Focus on a very specific audience. Trying to appeal to everyone never works.\n\n2.Do your most important work when your energy is at its best.\n\n3.Treat spending like testing. If something fails, learn and move on.\n\nThis way isn’t fast. But it works. And it feels way more real than all the “get rich quick” noise out there.\n\nIf you're trying something on the side, I’d love to hear how it's going for you.",

One of our biggest limiting factors is finding good enough cars in our area what I’m offering is for anyone Who can help find me used cars that I end up buying I will send you $100 just straight up that’s it. We buy between six and 10 cars a week so if you’re finding good opportunities, you can make some good money how it will work as I’m making a discord server where all specify what type of cars we buy And you just send them to me if we end up buying it I pay you that easy. As long as you have access to Facebook marketplace or used car marketplace platform you can do it. Lmk if interested.",

I see some people get millions of views and only paid like $50. I've seen others receive a fraction of that and make a lot more money. And by see, I mean those are the claims in the Discord. \n\nOne of them, from what I gather, is based on percentage. If their client pays $1000 to them, they may keep $100 and split the remaining $900 amongst all the people in the campaign. So if you and I are the solo campaigners, and we each have equal views, we would see around $450 each. But if I have 90% of the views, I might get $800 and you get $100. If you add more people to the campaign, everyone's potential profits drop. Does that make sense? \n\nI am a good video editor so I am going to give it a shot.

Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

          "body": "Truthfully, hardly any of them pay you without asking for deposits or some kind of risk trade. Most of what I see out there is either asking for investments up front or all hype. Lately, I've been checking out some new Web3-style earning platforms that focus a lot more on community engagement rather than just money in.\n\nThey usually reward users for performing simple digital tasks, such as joining campaigns, posting, sharing of content, or helping to test new tools. It's more about contributing to the growth of the project, not just \"click to earn.\"\n\nOne of the few that caught my eye is called DropWork. It's built on a structure where users can join various tasks, build their online reputation, and get rewards through their internal system called ClubChain. Everything happens inside the DropWork environment, minting, tasks, rewards, even communication.\n\nThe best thing I like is that you don't need to invest anything. It's not one of those \"deposit to unlock\" or \"pay to start\" things. You just sign up, start completing activities, and build up your level inside the system.\n\nIt's still pretty new, but I've been following its updates, and early testers are already seeing results. It reminds me of early community-driven crypto projects before things got too commercialized.\n\nHas anyone else here tried platforms like that, or any other community-based Web3 projects that pay users for activity, not investments?",

This gives you your 6 hours of work, with the unpaid lunch break.\n\n As for the 15s, I know different states have different rules, depending on the hours worked. In MA, you get one paid 15 if you work 4 hours, a paid 15 and an unpaid 30 at 6 hours and two paid 15s and an unpaid 30 at 8 hours.  \n\nYou'd probably have to check with HR about how those get scheduled.\n\nBest of luck!  😁",

Ads, as you can see, are now live on the site and have been for about 10 days.\n\nSo far, the RPMs are abysmal, only getting around $4 session RPM. I was hoping for $10 but this seems a bit far fetched for now.\n\nThat said, RPMs should increase as Mediavine continues to optimize ad placement and I hopefully continue to increase traffic. \n\nI am in their lowest rev share tier (75%) right now and this can get as high as 90%. \n\nBut in order to hit those tiers, I will have to significantly increase traffic - and I have done a bad job at that this month.\n\nMonthly traffic is still at 31k sessions, so no increase since the last update. \n\nWith the desktop app and especially with ads, this is all about scaling traffic (assuming I retain the same share of tier 1 country visitors). \n\nFor November, the tool site will probably make around $300 with sales of the app and ads. Idea is to reinvest every cent the side project makes into linkbuilding and maybe a few YouTube sponsorships (for the desktop app) down the line. \n\nStarting this, I always knew that it would be a 10 year side project and that the first few years would be somewhat slow.\n\nBut with ads now live, I am more confident than ever that I'll eventually get this to $10k in monthly revenue!",

He tells an anecdote about how all same three companies were allowed to bid.

One gets this contract, the other gets the next contract, everyone is happy and the government is big pile of shit anyways, so they can’t run a lemonade stand efficiently, let alone allocate billions.\n\nAlso, I think Palantir does a lot of stuff that they don’t want him to discuss publicly, like facial recognition software and weapons. \n\nLastly, who’s the CEO of Lockheed Martin?

One major part of most philosophy degrees is logic, and science is actually better than engineering if you want to understand things. I picked up coding, networking, database, and security skills by just working on projects, building things, and training. I worked as a senior software engineer in the Bay Area and DC/Northern Virginia. I've worked with some Palantir customers and  employees.\nI'm not saying the govy game isn't a lot of political word soup and name dropping. It's all about who you know and \"assisting\" in writing requirements so that your company will win contracts. I wonder if Palantir (or any other contractor) could survive without that giant gov teat in their mouths.\nEven so, I have personally built real products that are actually used and actually do what was promised in the public and private sectors -- not hand-wavy vaporware. In my limited experience, there are a lot of non traditional technical people like me who are the bosses of \"real engineers\". As Teddy Roosevelt said, the secret to success is being able to work with people, and in my experience, self-proclaimed \"real engineers\" are not exactly easy to work with. So, a philosophy degree that teaches you how to reason, read dense material, and write/present ideas is valuable. That's probably why philosophy has been the top undergrad degree for lawyers. People who know how to think and present information can pick up a myriad of technical details and be immediately useful across any organization.",

          "body": "When we talk about Tesla's value, we're talking about their market capitalization - \"market cap\" for short. Market cap is the price of an individual share of the company multiplied by the number of shares owned and traded by shareholders - these shares are also call \"outstanding shares\". \n\nSo, market cap = share price x outstanding shares. \n\nAs I type this, Tesla's share price is $428.79 and they have 3.33 *billion* outstanding shares, making their market cap roughly $1.428 *trillion*.\n\nOver the next decade, Musk has been tasked by the board to lead Tesla to hit certain goals. As he reaches each of these goals, he unlocks a portion of his compensation which is a mix of cash and equity (aka shares of Tesla). If  Tesla hits a certain number of goals by year 5, he'll receive the compensation amounts tied to those goals at the 7.5 year mark. If he hits all the other goals in time, he'll receive the rest of his compensation at the ten year mark provided he hasn't left the company.\n\nAmong his goals is increasing the Tesla share price so that the company's market cap exceeds $8 trillion - an almost 6x increase from today. Most of his compensation will be in equity and will increase his ownership in the company to (I believe) 29% - about double what he owns now. So in 2035, his assets may be worth over $2 trillion.",

I'm not saying this is right or wrong, just highlighting that we're already past any notion of this being simply about growing the company's assets.\n\nTesla are also facing significantly more competition than ever before - they've lost a lot of their 'edge' simply to the fact that many other EV manufacturers are now into their own second and third generation models, and most of the innovation that drove early Tesla popularity is starting to look a little dated. Again, this isn't a negative or positive comment on Tesla, just to point out that it's not simply a case of business as usual for them.\n\nMusk will have to really drive the company forward exponentially, and make the move into wider battery-related consumer products, where they still have a competitive advantage, to even get close to this valuation.\n\nSo, if they manage that new valuation, and regardless of anyone's personal opinions on Musk, he will undoubtedly be a major part of that growth, even though it's a truly disgusting amount of money, he'll have earned it.",

Not criticizing you for wanting to learn and know more or being skeptical, but it would make more sense if you understood the underlying business behind the deal rather than the fake news and social media.\n\nIf you are an entrepreneur (assuming since you are on this subreddit) then you should understand or at least try to understand a little bit about business. One of the questions I have regarding pay packages such as this one is I wonder if Elon will be paid his bonus regardless of whether or not he in fact hits his sales targets. It's my understanding that bonuses like this are typically paid despite whether someone hits targets or not out of professional courtesy. Can someone with more experience clarify this?\n\nObviously it depends on the size and complexity of the deal. A $1,000 Christmas bonus gets paid out way more consistently than something like this, but how are professional courtesy deals for bonuses handed out at the extreme levels like the CEO pay package deal of a big firm like Tesla or even smaller (like mid cap or small cap or microcap)",

Failing is one thing, but giving up is shameful. I tried 5 different entrepreneurial ideas before 1 actually landed. I spent 10s of thousands of dollars, found out who my real friends were and sacrificed my \"Fridays with the boys.\" I would be happy to do it all over again because the one idea I had that landed paid me back 10x long term and has given me more time with my family than I could have ever dreamed of. It's similar to the military in a way. If you sign up and they tell you to do 100 push ups, you do 100 push ups regardless of how long it takes. You could sit there and do 1 every 60 seconds. You could do 2 every 20 minutes. You are not leaving until 100 have been completed because that was the goal. If your goal is to be an entrepreneur, then you will be an entrepreneur. There will be no excuses because your mind won't be able to comprehend it. It's ok to be nervous, it's not ok to never start. If you think it's not for you, then it probably isn't. Have you ever heard a professional athlete say in an interview that they didn't think the sport was for them? No, the first thing they say is they are going to win the championship. If they don't win the championship, they say there's always next year. The goal of an entrepreneur isn't to be the guy in a suit, a $2M mansion, and 6 cars in the garage. If that's why you are doing it, then you will never succeed. The goal of an entrepreneur is to solve people's problems.",

You are the one that needs to make that final call, decision etc. Nobody is there to help you.\n\nPeople get jealous - for this reason, keep everything very private. Especially revenue numbers. Most people just don't understand revenue / gp / np. They look at revenue only and have no idea.\n\nFriends and family etc are not really supporting you. They will be very skeptical. They will be expecting you to fail. They often will not act in a way that will help you.\n\nYou only truly fail when you quit. I have seen so many small business owners start and do ok, but don't have what it takes to keep going when it is a pure grind. It gets boring, very uncomfortable and not worth it. Until you get to a point where you are at a comfortable revenue / gp level that makes sense. You have to be in it for the long haul. For most this is 5+ years.\n\n Many people you deal with are not compatible with you or your company. This goes for customers, staff, friends / family and quite often other businesses. It's fine, don't take anything personally and just move on. Only deal with people that are good, isolate yourself from anyone else however hard that is.\n\nWhen and if you are successful, keep it to yourself. It's nobody's business but your own. The less people you tell, the better your life will be. Most people don't understand money and taxes, especially at a higher level. So if you make a million dollars for example, they would think you are rich. In reality you would need to give away so much of that money to take it, that it is not worth it. Especially when considering the missed opportunities you have when the government takes half of it.\n\nYou are always better off being honest and ethical. People and businesses that do not take this very seriously do not last.",

I should walk away, after tax, with low/mid 9-figures.): \n\nAny of the Rich Dad/Poor Dad Series by Robert Kiyosaki: Great for mindset and understanding how money and business works.\n\nMultifamily Millionaire (vol 1 and 2) by Brandon Turner, et. al.  Great for understanding real estate and how it really works. \n\nThe Due Diligence Handbook for Commercial Real Estate by Brian Hennessey: Understanding what to look for in buying CRE. \n\nFamily Wealth by James E. Hughes, jr. How to deal with wealth over generations (yes, I know most of you are not at this point, but it's good to start with the mindset of \"I'm already wealthy and so I'll start acting and behaving in that manner now\"). \n\nThe 10X Rule by Grant Cardone. Mindset and focus (yes, I know Cardone is either loved or hated. I feel neither way towards him. I'd never invest with him in his real estate ventures, but there are lessons in this book).\n\nThe encyclopedia of Real Estate Advice by Terry Painter: Understanding better how real estate and works and why it's important to buy assets and not liabilities.\n\nThe Internet of Money by Andreas M. Antonopoulos. Read the entire series. It's eye opening.\n\nThe Big Print by Lawrence Lepard. Truly understand the shell game that is money. Once you understand it and realize that you are NOT going to change the game, you can focus on profiting from the game (the game you can not change).\n\nThe Almanack of Naval Ravikant by Eric Jorgenson. Great insights!\n\n\n\"Relentless\" and \"Winning\" by Tim Grover. Serious motivation on what it takes to succeed at a high level. I relisten to these at least every year or two.\n\nThe Creative Dealmaker by Carl Allen. How to do 'buy and build' businesses. Why fuck around with a start up (since most fail), why not target an already successful business that you can take to a higher level.\n\nThe 1% Rule by Tommy Baker.

How to hyper focus on the most important things that move your business and your life forward\n\nNegotiation Genuis by Deepak Malhorta and Max Bazerman: Learn how to negotiate\n\nPeak by Robert Pool and Anders Ericsson: How to master the skills that matter for your success\n\nThe Bitcoin Standard by Saifadean Ammous. 3/4 of the book is about understanding money and how the economy really works and the role bitcoin might play in that moving forward.

This is the mindset whether you're starting a business or buying an existing business\n\nThe Big Rich by Bryan Burroughs. True story of the Texas oil boom and what happened to those involved.  Completely worth a read...filled with life and business lessons.\n\nAcquisitional Wealth by Josh Tolley: How to buy an existing business and grow it. \n\nThe Art of Selling your Business by John Warrilow: Start with the end in mind.\n\nRead everything that Pat Lencione writes.\n\nBuy Then Build by Walker Diebel: Why risk a start up...buy an existing business. This book teaches you what to look for and how to do it.\n\nRead Adam Coffey's books, Empire Builder, The Exit Strategy Playbook, The Private Equity Playbook.\n\nThe Trillion Dollar Coach by Eric Schmidt: Just read it...NOW.\n\nAngel Investing by David Rose: You need to understand the game of raising capital no matter what side of the table you're sitting on. This gives you insight into the buy side (angel investor side) of the table. You better understand their mindset\n\nAngel by Jason Calacanis. Understanding Angel Investing. Whether you're an Angel or seeking Angel money, you need to understand the game.\n\nThe Power Law by Sebastian Mallaby: Again, understanding the game of angel, VC and PE. \n\nHigh Output Management by Andy Grove. High level stuff, but worth a read so you can understand what your COO/Operations person is doing and how to build a great team.\n\nThe Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz: Just read it.\n\nThe Path Between the Seas by David McCullough. Why would I recommend a story about the building of the Panama Canal? Because it's one the best books I've ever read and it's filled with life and business lessons. Plus, no matter how bad you think you've got it...no matter how difficult your problems seem...they are NOTHING compared to what these men (and women) went through to make engineering marvel become a reality.\n\nTitan by Ron Chernow: Biography of Rockefeller. So worth the read.\n\nMellon by David Canadine. One of the greatest men of the gilded age...whether you like him or now.\n\nThe Power Broker by Robert Caro: If you want to understand how politics works...if you want to understand the two pillars that drive everything in the world (Power and Money)...then read this book. It may be the best book I've ever read.\n\nThe LBJ biography series by Robert Caro. The BEST biographical series I've ever read. LBJ was Caro's hero. As Caro learned...never meet your hero. LBJ is (IMHO) the greatest politician in the history of America. And I say that as someone who things he's one of the worst presidents ever. If you truly want to understand politics...read this fucking series NOW. The section on \"Box 13\" is MINDBLOWING.\n\nThe House of Morgan by Ron Chernow. Understand how a great business was built that changed the world.\n\nSo far in 2025, I've read/listened to almost 200 books at least once. In 2024, I listened to and/or read 150 books. This is a partial list of books that I found worthwhile over the last 23 months. \n\nI hope there is a gem or two in this list for the group.",

I was listening to a podcast (dont remember who) years ago and this woman name Dr Carol Robin created a successful course called touchy feely that helps people develop better communication and leadership skills. She wrote a book on it called Connect and said she hopes it sells well but wasnt sure because you can't just read the book and develop those skills. It ended up not selling well based on the number of Amazon reviews and you really need to be in a classroom with a bunch of people to talk to for it to work. \n\n\nI'm not saying books are a waste of time but people really need to apply themselves with what the book teaches which can usually involve a lot more work than people want to do. I actually think there's probably a lot of good YouTube channels that can help people succeed but its hard to filter through them to find the good ones. Some of them are actually successful and some only talk about being successful hoping their YouTube channel will take off so they can sell courses on how they did it or something lol. ",

Or she can continue working 1 or 2 days a week at her job if she wants to. \n\nMaybe I'm not being realistic, but a man can dream and I'm working hard to try and make that dream a reality lol.",

My boos, let's call him \"visionary man\", is all sales and big promises. I'm the one who built the whole stack: Rust/Node APIs, Tauri/React desktop apps, manages all the servers, load balancing, database. I literally build all the engine for all high-stake client projects.\n\nThe amount of work done is huge, the pressure is constant, but the pay is nonexistent. For months, our Whatsapp chat has been a broken record: me begging for my weekly pay, and him giving the excuses: \"I'm at zero\", \"waiting for money to come in,\" or just to busy flying around. To keep me motivated, he only keeps talking up about the future, how we'll \"get rich\" later with his next big project ,and that I just need to be patient.\n\nThe whole thing blew up recently. He's obsessed with this personal project, and when it slowed down because I was actually focusing on my school and personal stuff, he went off on me. He accused me of not being dedicated, compared me to his own insane workload. He then threatened my financial stake: he warned that if he has to invest more of his own money to keep his pet project moving, **the whole percentage picture changes.**\n\nThis is the bottom line: I built the business assets, but he treat my labor like free capital, and now he's threatening my future.\n\nI need some advice of what decision should take, i don't have any experience with this things. What would an experienced entrepreneur do?\n\nI'd be happy to answer any questions and provide more information about the situation, without revealing any personal details about the project or the company.\n\nSorry for my bad english, it's not my native language.\n\n\\[IMPORTANT EDIT\\]\n\nThank you for all the advice you've given me in this post. I think there were many details I didn't mention because I assumed they were obvious (obviously my mistake).\n\n* I'm 16 years old\n* I live in Venezuela\n* I never signed a contract to work for this person\n* I don't have legal permission to work\n* My boss has government connections, so it's unlikely I'd win in a legal battle.",

          "body": "Listen, you’ve done great. At 17, you’ve already built a whole platform, written the code, designed the architecture - something that grown-up companies spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on. That is your intellectual property.\n\nNow let’s get to the point. You’ve made a common mistake of many young guys - you trusted words instead of putting things on paper. Business is not about “trusting someone’s word,” business is about agreements that are legally documented.\n\nWhen there is no contract, no share agreement, no act of completed work - legally, it looks like you just “helped voluntarily.” And now your “partner” is using that against you.\n\n**Here is what I would advise you:**\n\n1. **Stop working for free.** If someone doesn’t respect you as a partner, don’t give them your work for nothing. Free work kills respect.\n2. **Document what you have built.** Save the code, structure, repositories, architecture - everything that proves you are the creator. Make a backup. This is your intellectual property.\n3. **Talk calmly but firmly.** Say: “I appreciate what we built together, but I can’t keep working without payment and clear terms. Either we sign an agreement about shares and compensation, or I step away from the project.” No emotions, just a clear, adult conversation.\n4. **Don’t be afraid to walk away.** You’re young, and you have many opportunities ahead. One toxic ‘visionary’ doesn’t define your future. It’s better to lose an illusionary share in a bad project than to lose time and self-respect.\n5. **Learn the lesson.** Real partnership means both sides contribute something valuable - one brings money, the other brings skills - but it must be formalized. Friendship is friendship, but business is business.\n\n**Most importantly:** don’t be bitter. This isn’t a failure, it’s your first business lesson.  \nWe’ve all gone through something like this. The main thing is not to lose faith in yourself and never let anyone use your talent for free.",

Spend some cathartic time talking with friends about what an asshole he was.\n\nFirst thing first.  Cut your losses.  If you control the product, shut it down, take it away, break the code.  Whatever.  Make sure he doesn't get anything else from you.  End the relationship, take anything you can get easily and be done.\n\nSecond thing.  Make a list of the things you keep from this negative experience.  I've lost money and huge amounts of time to a bad partner.  BUT, the work I did, the knowledge I gained, the lessons I learn and take away are mine no matter what.  No one can take this away from you.  You have skills, abilities and lessons that will forever be yours.\n\nThird thing.  Focus on these good things that came out of this shitty situation.   There are many like listed above.  These are the ways you become wise and experienced.   They set you apart.   Bad outcomes at an early age shape you and give you wisdom your contemporaries don't have.   Spend time understanding and processing these good things.\n\nMy take away from my bad partner was to not have partners.  I will always own my companies 100% or with my wife.  A partner is effectively like chosing a wife.  It is that important.  Problem is, you'll never know your partner well enough.  I understand that it is difficult to build a business alone so I'm happy to have employees, contractors, etc help, but not a partner.  I believe that reciprocal service contracts are the solution if required.  My business helps your business, we exchange services according to a year to year contract (\"evergreen contract continues until a decision to stop\").  This way, when a situation comes up where your contractual partner behaves in an untenable way, the contract is severed, but the business is preserved.\n\nSorry about your situation.  Sorry your partner took advantage of you.  Learn, grow and prosper.",

Him acknowledging your agreement and promising to pay is valid. If you do the tech as a partner you have to address when and how you will get paid or what the profit share is. If you built it as a vendor I suggest you built a backdoor and shut it down until he pays. You can’t unfortunately do both- be a partner and co-carry the risk and get paid like an employee",

Give yourself time to think about what you want to say, and give him time to send whatever he wants to say before you respond (like if he’s bullying you, just let him rage text a bunch and respond later to everything).\n\n4. Prepare yourself to say / write whatever is true and professional. This is a good lesson at your age. It’s never too early to stand up for yourself without anger or aggression. Say it like it is. It’s a mistake to assume that being nice and agreeable is good for the relationship. Be truthful and kind, but also direct and say the thing that’s uncomfortable. “The company has an asset because of me. I believe I am entitled to more ownership if I’m not being paid. That would be fair. Ideally we would have determined ownership by the value each founder is bringing to the table.” Say it in the mirror 100 times 100 different ways.\n\n5. Be flexible but set a standard for yourself. You’re now becoming the person you will someday be.

          "body": "So, there's a **lot** to unpack here, and there's a **lot** of information missing. \n\n\nFirst things first, then: Everything here is going to be wobbly, for a few reasons. You've stated that English isn't your primary language, which *generally* indicates that you are not in the United States. Most people on Reddit (including myself) are US residents, so our thoughts are going to be strongly influenced by customs, laws, and business practices prevalent here in the US. You will need to compare anything here against what standards exist where you live. In other words, take this as general advice, not specific guidance. \n\n\nSecondly, you stated you are still in high school. That adds depth to the legal and business standards \"wobble\", because so many legal rights are contingent on your age. \n\n\nThird and last, there's a significant factor missing from the equation, independent of the first two - how is your business structured. You mentioned a partner, but there's very little (essentially, none) mentioned about how your business is organized - both practical and legal. One guy does the relationship stuff, one guy does the technical stuff.\n\n\nSo, with all of that out of the way, I am going to approach this from the perspective that you are of legal age, and that your country has the same legal and business standards of (most of) the United States. Keep that in mind and adjust accordingly. \n\n\nYou need to begin by assessing your business structure, and ownership of your work product. If you're the sole owner of your work product, in all honesty, you hold the cards here. The way you describe it, your business \"partner\" is a parasite. He's using your tangible, functional product to generate (or attempt to generate) revenue, and either failing to fairly compensate you from that revenue or failing to monetize your product at all. \n\n\nSo, if you have a viable and beneficial product, what is stopping you from simply ending your \"partnership\" with this person? Do you have a contractual obligation to them? If so, who created this obligation? What terms were discussed when this agreement was created? Contracts have to have equitable consideration to be valid - if your agreement has become \"you do all the work, and get nothing in return\", then your contract could be in breach. What remedies did you agree to if the contract was breached? Did the two of you even have the discussion about how things can end? \n\n\nAs a little bit of wisdom for the future: a very good way to know if you want to partner with someone is if they actively discuss what happens if/when *something goes wrong*. What happens if one of you dies? Gets sick? If you are sued? Who owns what if you dissolve your partnership? Business isn't \"let's join forces and get rich\" (which is exactly what I hear you describing) but rather \"let's join forces and solve a constant stream of challenges and hopefully be profitable doing it\".\n\n\nLet me ask you this - do you have a successful family member, friend, teacher that you trust? Is there a person in your life that is generous, intelligent, and older? I think you need a mentor. A person who can ask you questions and make you think. Who can offer you advice based on experience and expertise; who has walked this road before and can help you avoid these potholes. \n\n\nIt's a tough thing for the \"nerds\" of the world - you/we tend to take things at face value, because we value accuracy and truth, and struggle to understand how someone would be willing to succeed by cheating. \n\n\nBut, unfortunately, success by lying is extremely common, and it appears your current partner is one of those people. You should start exploring what your options are to dissolve your partnership, and instead find someone who can genuinely point you towards the way forward. \n\n\nCheck with your local colleges, universities, or other institutions of higher learning. Often, they have or are affiliated with \"startup\" organizations - groups that provide funding, resources, networking, and leadership to new businesses. \n\n\nI wish you the best.",

You didn’t get “screwed,” you just saw how business power actually works.\n\nHere’s the blunt truth: without a contract, you own the *work*, but not the *business*. Without pay, you’re not a “partner,” you’re unpaid labor being managed through promises. He’s not paying because he doesn’t have to - you’ve already delivered the product and have no leverage left that he cares about.\n\nWhat you *do* still have is knowledge leverage. You built the system. You know how it works. That means you can walk away, rebuild it cleaner, and showcase it as your portfolio. Quietly back up your code, protect your access, and stop touching his servers so you can’t get blamed later.\n\nDon’t argue with him. Don’t threaten. Just end it clean:\n\n&gt;\n\nAfter that - block, vanish, rebuild.  \nPost what you built (without any private data) on GitHub or a demo site. That story - *“I built a company’s full tech stack at 16”* \\- will open doors for you way faster than chasing this guy ever could.\n\nThis is your first real-world lesson in ownership: if it’s not written down or paid for, it’s not real. Learn it once, never repeat it. Next time, use a simple contract and get partial payment upfront.\n\nTurn the loss into proof that you’re already operating at a higher level than the guy who exploited you.",

Personally, I would get a lawyer, then quit writing in my resignation letter that you have secured the company IP but until you're paid for the work, you won't change the access.

For example, everyone pushed for high paying jobs such as a doctor vs a musician.  I for one faced what to do when my son announced he is creative vs sports type (at 14 and six foot two).  So there goes my star athletes dreams for my son.  Instead I took him to different creative events, related conferences, to listen to how others succeed in the very competitive illustrationist world.\n\nConsider that hundreds of thousands if not millions  compete in a given organized sport.  Only ten of thousands get to compete at the highest college levels and only five hundred get to join the professional ranks.  An acqaintance was to be drafted professionally but before the draft he had a major injury.  So he never made the professional ranks.  Think of the professional ranks in business to be the Bezos, Zuckerberg, and so of the world.  Does this make my acquaintance any less a sports or business professional.  No, they lead a multi million dollar business with 500 employees that no one knows about.  Another leads a one or two million dollar service company and still travels the world in her free time.\n\nThe right beginning mindset for me is the quote on persistence attributed to Calvin Coolidge - never give up.  You will make mistake (we are human afterall), so learn from it then leave behind and move forward.\n\nSet goals but also create systems to enable you to achieve your goals. Your goals are early strategy development.  Your systems are your operations.  Your performance begins with a mindset.",

          "body": "Workaholism is a common path to success, but it is not the only path. What we tend to call “work-life balance” is usually a moving target, and it looks different at each stage of a company. Early on, intensity often spikes. Later, the founders who keep winning are the ones who build systems that let them work with focus, not just with hours.\n\nSome very successful leaders have been public about strict boundaries, deep work over long work, sabbaticals, or seasonal sprints. Think 4-day or 5-hour workday experiments, no-meeting days, or founders who prioritize long walks, reading, and thinking time. Others design businesses that match their chosen lifestyle, which is a legitimate and difficult kind of ambition. These people are not lazy. They are obsessed with leverage, not with time on task.\n\nWhat you are noticing, that productivity can be a defense against fear, is very common. Fear of failure. Fear of irrelevance. Fear of not being enough. Workaholism can numb those feelings. The problem is that it also numbs creativity, judgment, and relationships. You can build a big company that way, but you pay for it somewhere.\n\nA more useful frame is “sustainable intensity.” You can be extremely ambitious without living at a permanent 11. The trick is to choose where intensity lives.\n\n**A simple playbook:**\n\n1. Decide your non-negotiables. Sleep, family dinners, exercise, spiritual practice, therapy, whatever keeps you sane. Put those in the calendar first and treat them like board meetings.\n2. Work in seasons. Run 6 to 8 week sprints with clear goals, then recover. Sprint, ship, recover, repeat. Always include a cool-down week where you pay down debt and protect thinking time.\n3. Make fear explicit. Write the worst-case scenario, the prevention plan, and the recovery plan. Once fear has a plan, the nervous system calms down and the need to grind for safety drops.\n4. Trade hours for leverage. Hire for outcomes, not roles. Automate reporting. Kill 80 percent of meetings. Replace generic “work more” with one needle-moving action per day.\n5. Protect deep work. Two to four hours a day of distraction-free focus beats ten hours of context switching. Phone in another room, calendar blocks, one shared priority list for the team.\n6. Design for boredom tolerance. If the only way you feel valuable is by staying busy, you will overbuild, overhire, and overcommit. Practice leaving white space, then resist filling it.\n7. Measure the real scoreboard. Energy, clarity, quality of decisions, relationships with your core people. Revenue and growth matter. These leading indicators matter first.\n\nTwo honest conclusions can both be true. One, there are founders who work less than the stereotype and still win because they design for leverage and compounding. Two, most world-class outcomes require aggressive seasons, and pretending otherwise is delusional. The art is choosing intensity on purpose, then letting it end.\n\nIf you are productive because you are scared, you are not broken. You are human. Keep the edge, lose the compulsion. Build a business that can survive your vacation. That is what success looks like when it lasts.",

          "body": "Thanks for bringing up this important question u/Miyamoto_Musashi_x. Having read through the discussion here, I think the real insight several commenters have highlighted is that it's not about the hours themselves but rather the underlying motivation and system architecture.\n\n\n\nThe ilodey comment really stood out with that $2M/year e-commerce example - working 25-30 hours weekly but with extreme intentionality about saying no to non-essentials. That's a fundamentally different approach than grinding 80 hours out of fear.\n\n\n\nI think the most important distinction the community is making here is between two types of busy:\n\n\n\n1. Productive obsession: When you're genuinely passionate about solving a problem. ilooley mentioned coding for 12 hours and feeling energized rather than drained. That's quality work.\n\n\n\n2. Anxious busyness: Running from fear as you mentioned. The constant email checking, weekend work, guilt when stopping. That's burnout waiting to happen.\n\n\n\nLooking at comments from lapserdak1 and mrgoldweb, the theme is clear - successful entrepreneurs who maintain balance built systems and processes that don't require their constant presence. They delegated, automated, and scaled thinking rather than scaled their own hours.\n\n\n\nThe reality is probably that yes, you'll likely work a lot in the early stages. But that phase should be about building the infrastructure so you don't have to forever. Not every business model allows for this (as electricgnome and others pointed out), but it's worth being intentional about which business models you choose.\n\n\n\nThe test several people mentioned - can you take a week off without anxiety - is brilliant. That's your indicator of whether you've actually built a business or just created a demanding job.\n\n\n\nAppreciate you sparking this conversation. These nuances about productive work versus anxious work are crucial for entrepreneurs to understand early.",

      "selftext": "Hey folks - so i'm in my 30s, built and sold a very successful company 5 years ago. Always been self employed, never had a job - had self sustaining revenue and lived well since college. \n\nAfter exiting my last company- i spent a few years pursuing the arts - music, comedy and a social media career. I partied a lot spent money and dealt with some mental issues and that didnt really go anywhere due to issues in my personal life (wife)\n\nNow i have been working on a new business - that is somewhat similar to my old business, with learnings. \nI got into this mostly cause money running out - neccesity. vs my first company, which was very much my entire identity and a life long mission. \n\nIt seems ive lost the spark- have had a bunch of ups and downs with the new company (maybe economy? Or competition). But it feels like because i already got wealthy i have just lost that Killer instinct. \n\nMy rational mind says figure it out.  Build and sell new business and focus, then make a run on the creative endeavors again. \n\nHas anyone else \"peaked\" and gotten the spark back?",

Most people do that first company with a chip on their shoulder, they have something to prove, people doubt them, they doubt themselves. That’s where a lot of the killer instinct comes from in a lot of people. But some people are just in it for the game, the end goal isn’t to win and make money, it’s to watch that line go up, to see how far they can really take it. \n\nMy solution to this problem was to plan it out long term. I don’t wanna build to sell, I want to build to retire. Your problem now was that you went back out of necessity. And it just became another job. A possible solution is don’t sell, don’t leave, keep it for as long as you can. Find a way to distance yourself from the day to day and let it run itself.  Then use the funds to allow yourself to do something that actually makes you happy.",

You already know this but the more you take of it, the more it takes care of you. \n\nI've was self-employed most all my life and I have anxiety and depression which is a pain in my ass. Despite those issues, I managed to survive through good times and bad. I had a health issue requiring surgery and didn't have health insurance which put me in the county hospital, it actually wasn't too bad but it scared me.\n\nI got a regular job with benefits after that and have been employed for 14 years which taught me a whole new industry. I've got some specialty industry expertise now and I'm starting a side business using my inside knowledge. I have renewed excitement and my mental health is quite good so I'm ready for action. During this 14 years, I'd still do some side work or sell equipment on eBay but not a full on business that needed commitment.\n\nAnyway, nobody has a gun to your head to start a business and there's nothing wrong with exploring other options. You might gain an insight into an industry and find new opportunities to get excited about. There are so many ways to live life, don't be a slave to your past, open up your mind and look around. \n\nI'm not necessarily saying chuck what you're doing but I am saying life can change who you are and sometimes you have to adjust to those changes.",

      "selftext": "It's a dumb question. You're not dumb, just maybe uninformed, which I will rectify shortly. But the question is very, very dumb.\n\nFirst off, people who ask \"what business should I start?\" are really asking \"how can I make a lot of money?\"\n\nStraight up, starting a business is a crappy way to make a lot of money. Statistically most people lose money. You're probably going to lose money. So, if you want to make a lot of money, get into management consulting or ibanking, which generally means getting an MBA. Have fun with that.\n\nSecondly, people who ask \"what business should I start?\" generally think that businesses are fungible, which means they're a commodity or easily swapped out with one another. This, btw, is why most businesses fail. Because people think that businesses are just this thing that you start and money comes out the other end.\n\nIf I said a great business is rolling up a bunch of dentist practices, would you know what to do with that? Like, do you have dentistry experience? Do you have PE experience rolling up companies? If the answer is no to both, don't fucking roll up a bunch of dentist practices. It requires skills you don't have.\n\nIf I said, \"ooh! ooh! ooh! AI, baby! AI is gonna change everything,\" are you especially good at AI? If you're not, then one school of thought would say that AI is a growing market, so you should learn AI and sell those services to other people. There's another school of thought that says every fucking person and their grandmother is learning AI right now so they can sell  services to other people and I really wonder what you are going to discover about AI that's going to make you better than my grandma.\n\nLastly, markets aren't interchangeable either.\n\nI spent nearly 30 years starting tech companies. Had a few successes and a bunch of failures. Now, I'm a world-class startup coach. I do that job exceptionally well, I have great word of mouth, make a lot of money. And when I started, I knew A LOT of people in several startup ecosystems. My access to that market helped me get off the ground and eventually scale this business.\n\nIf I decided to start a company selling shit to celebrities, I would fail. I would 100% fail. Why? I don't know any celebrities. I don't have access to that market and I'd probably run out of money and time before I figured out how to get celebrities' attention.\n\nStop asking what business you should start. They aren't lego bricks.\n\nHere's a much better question to ask yourself: what do I love to do?\n\nFind something you love to do. Get good at it. Prove that you're good at it by selling your services to other people, either as an employee or a contractor. Get promoted and get a great title. Or become a consultant, which is just a contractor who charges a shit ton of money.\n\nGet so good at what you love that you know things about your job and market that no one else knows about. Understand secrets about your industry that give you a fundamentally unfair advantage over everyone else. Even my grandmother.\n\nThen go start a business using that knowledge. That's the business you should start.\n\nEDIT: random spelling and grammatical errors. I type for shit.",

          "body": "I disagree. \n\nYou are speaking from the perspective of someone who has been in business for decades, but most of the people who ask these questions have never built their own thing. They might have fantasized about it, but they are either still in school or are shackled by a 9 to 5.\n\n  \nStarting a business is really hard. It is scary, risky, and almost everyone you know with a 9 to 5 will deride you for the decision.\n\nAnd one of the ways to make the journey easier is to build a community around you where you feel supported and advised.\n\nSo, when I see someone ask, \"What should I start?\", I am seeing someone who is scared to take the plunge and is trying to dip their toe. I see someone who is trying to diffuse their risk by asking for advice from more seasoned individuals.\n\nThat said, my main gripes are:\n\n1. I don't mind you asking, but I do mind you failing to execute on it. At the end of the day, you just have to take the leap, especially if you are still starting out. \n\n2. It is okay to ask for advice, but at the end of the day, you have to make up your own mind, and if you fail, you can't blame anyone else but yourself. In other words, don't start a business because others told you to, start it because you believe in it.\n\n3. Building a business is a marathon, not a sprint. There are no shortcuts, no viral hacks, and no expert tactics to help you leapfrog the competition. You need to put in a ton of elbow grease and understand that the best quality you can have is grit.\n\nSo, my perspective is ask for advice but then do something about it.",

Creating speculative assets would not be a core feature of this infrastructure and standard debt-based approaches would also not exist as primitives on this system. Things like home financing is done based on local reputation scores and would require demonstration of value-added projects to the community. \n\nI'd lobby governments and municipalities into making sure that is all above board. Governance gets bootstrapped by the org itself initially but is eventually relinquished to the community members after an incubation period. My org must not retain any benefit (at all) from these communities creating their own financial infrastructure. \n\nI'd fund local and productive initiatives in exchange for minimal equity in said initiatives (commodity production, useful services, skilled labor education, etc..).\n\nMy time would be spent travelling to these communities with my family and team.",

I've seen small businesses get 10-15 hours back per week just by automating their email responses and basic customer support with tools like Zapier + chatGPT integrations. start with one workflow that's currently driving you crazy, automate that completely, then move to the next one - trying to automate everything at once usually leads to overwhelm and half-finished systems.",

Saves a ton of manual data entry and posting.\n\nThe other huge time sink is usually customer comms. I work at eesel AI and we see this all the time with small businesses. Basically setting up an AI to handle all the repetitive questions ('where's my order?', 'what are your hours?', etc) so you're not typing the same answer 10 times a day.

For instance, learning a lot about M&amp;A (merger and acquisition) or how to manage 1,000 employees when you're first week into your business is pointless. Yeah it sounds cool because big players do it, but you don't need to learn those at first.\n\nThis is also why building a good team is important, so that you're not just one person trying to learn so many skills.

I've seen technically perfect products fail because the founder couldn't communicate value or reach customers. Second, develop a relentless problem-solving mindset rather than chasing perfection in every skill area. Third, focus on customer discovery before you build anything - this saves you from building something nobody wants. Fourth, understand basic business fundamentals like cash flow and unit economics. Finally, consistency matters more than perfection at the start. The businesses that survive aren't run by experts in everything, but by people willing to learn what they need to learn when they need to learn it. Your biggest early wins will come from customer conversations and sales, not from having the perfect tech stack.

          "body": "I deal with this regularly in my management role. I meditate daily to keep my mind clear. When I am heading to the meeting I usually know what I am responsible for and what is important. I usually use the title and description of the meeting on teams to prepare and write a short punch list of what I need from it and what I need to execute. Then if the meeting goes past the allotted time I excuse myself saying \"I think I have what I need from this meeting can I be excused? I really have some important objectives to achieve in the next hour.\" I usually do not get pushback from setting boundaries. Meetings usually have a set time allotment and I try not to go past that time period. If it is completely off track I write down important questions for that department before I leave and send a clarification email after leaving. The whole point of meetings is to relay information. If the person who is in charge does not relay information in an efficient manner it is not your fault and your work is just as important as everyone else's. So set meeting boundaries and make sure you get what you need while you are there. Never leave before the time allotment and only engage in longer than anticipated meetings if your superior or his superior is present. Excuse yourself in any meeting you can as soon as the time has run over. If you can delegate tasks to AI or someone competent and close and have them send you detailed notes to review at your convenience. Your time is money 🤑 the less you have the freedom to use it the lower your income. If you are the boss then delegation should be top priority by choosing capable reports to handle 90% of the busy work. 5% of the people handle payroll, accounting, and I'm invoicing. The last 5% is yours to plan at your leisure.",

If you're spending all your time on administrative tasks instead of steering the ship, it's impossible to move forward. \n\nThe real cost to consider here is **opportunity cost**: what is the cost of *you* doing this work instead of focusing on your core business? How much is your time worth, and could it be better spent on sales or strategy instead of playing catch-up on notes? \n\nThe big question to ask is: **how much time are you currently wasting on workarounds?** Your scattered notes are a workaround. When you realize the cost of your time trying to fix these issues (and the risk of forgetting a commitment) is more than the cost of a new tool, it's time to upgrade.\n\nBefore you look at any new tool, it helps to identify the specific problem you're trying to solve. It sounds like you don't need a massive, complex system; you need one that's great at tracking who said what and what was agreed upon.

Six months in and it's the opposite.\n\nIts funny, nearly every post I make on this Subreddit says this, but no one listens. Entrepreneurship isn't taking control, it is giving up more of it, especially when you're first getting started.\n\nYou cease answering to a boss and begin answering to staff, contractors, investors, clients, tax men, bankers, vendors, and more.\n\nHaving a single person to answer to is a luxury people fail to see until they're drowning.\n\n&gt;7 hours of meetings yesterday. Then spent hours trying to remember what was decided in each one. \\[...\\] The worst part? Keeping track of it all. Who said what, when things are due, which client needs what follow-up. I'm constantly scrambling through scattered notes trying to piece together what was actually agreed upon.\n\nProject managers, especially those who are experts in specialized methods like Scrum or Canban, etc, are paid a lot of money to teach teams systems of managing projects. Bosses are project managers. You need to learn how to manage your tasks, commitments, and duties and prioritize, triage, and complete them.\n\nDo you know 4 out of 5 small businesses fail in 5 years? Because their owners think they can fire a boss and do the same thing with less stress. Nope, you now are the boss, and everything you took for granted at the place you once worked is now on you... project management, sales, bookkeeping, hr, and more.\n\nYou can fix this. See below.\n\n&gt;Everything is \"urgent\" and \"quick 15-minute chats\" turn into hour-long requirement sessions.\n\nWelcome to an important thing called: setting boundaries. Plan 30 or 60 minute chats, and keep you and your fellow meeting person on task. If someone says \"I have a 15-minute quick question\", and it isn't, talk to them about ways they can better prepare themselves and you so you do not overrun the schedule. Require follow-ups if you can't finish, but also, teach the people you work with that your time is valuable and brevity and directness is mandatory and respectful.\n\n&gt;I'm drowning in administrative overhead and playing catch-up on commitments I made in meetings I can barely remember.\n\nThis isn't a symptom of too many meetings, this is a symptom of a lack of a lack of organization and lack of knowledge how to get organized. Not to be harsh, but this is a you problem not an entrepreneurship problem. That said, welcome to the biz.\n\nYou can learn what you need to know.\n\nTake notes. Create to-do items from meetings. Use productivity tools to keep track of items. Use Canban or Scrum methods to track items. Task management apps can be formatted toward those techniques. Create summaries you can easily access every start of work day. \n\nIf you can't keep track of choices you and your team make, you're not ready to do this thing you're doing.\n\nPerhaps put a one-week pause on new meetings and focus on learning a system to stay organized.",

Figure out total revenue avg customer brings in lifetime and then figure out a to acquire customers for 1/3rd of that cost.  We spend about $5k per month to acquire $5k in MRR. So those customers are basically profitable from the 2nd week, and avg retention is 2 years.\n\nAnd regarding the channels itself, here are every channel that works for us today:\n\n1. Google Ads: 80% of our customers find us through Google search ads, where we spend around $5k per month. Most of these are on our industry keywords and competitor keywords. \n2. Reddit: We have setup Reddit notifier on certain keywords around the problem we solve to get notified anytime someone comments or makes a post. Somebody from our team usually joins the thread and adds value while subtle plugging the our product- no links, just name!\n3. Blogs &amp; SEO: Since Google search ads already work for us, we invest consistently on SEO via blogs on our website to show up as top result or on AI overview for customer searches on Google! These days these are mostly automated using AI tools like Frizerly and Pulse and stuff!\n4. Conferences: We always asked our friends in the space what conferences they were going to, and we would go hang out around there for free and talk to as many people as we can. \n5. LinkedIn Founder Marketing: This is something that works for us but I hate doing it. But making thought leadership content and posting it under your founder profile helps especially if your target customers are on LinkedIn. For a lot of the startups I personally know, this is the primary channel right now!\n\nAnd that’s about it. Hope this helps anyone out there in the similar space &amp; good luck!",

It's about genuine conversations and sharing what we've learned, even those face-palm moments.\n\nSomething else that's been a game-changer: strategic partnerships.

I’ve tried switching jobs, but everything I’m qualified for ends up being another desk job.

Here, everyone and their cousin runs a handyman service, landscaping business, or garden business—so breaking into those feels like fighting over scraps. I don’t have a trade license, and I can’t afford to reboot a whole career while paying my mortgage.\n\n**But I** ***do*** **have $70,000 saved right now that I can put toward building something of my own.**\n\nMy question is:  \n**What can someone in my position reasonably do with $70k to break free from traditional office work and build a self-sustaining career?**\n\nI’m open to:\n\n* Service-based businesses\n* Mobile businesses\n* Online/remote businesses that *aren’t* corporate desk jobs\n* Buying equipment and starting something myself\n* Anything that gets me out of a cubicle and gives me control over my schedule\n\nI’m not afraid of long hours. I’m not afraid of hard physical work. I just need something that isn’t slowly destroying my mental health.\n\n**If you were in my situation—rural area, almost 40, $70k saved, burned out from office life—what would you do?

I get why you are done with the office stuff, and the fact that you have seventy thousand saved puts you in a very strong position.\n\nThe one piece of advice I would give you is this. Do not stop working under any circumstances. That savings buys you flexibility, not a full exit. What it really gives you is the chance to move into something lower stress and more tolerable while you build your own thing on the side. That can be a simple job, something physical, something that brings a bit of joy or at least does not drain you the way a desk job does. But having some income and staying in the working world matters a lot.\n\nIf you walk away completely, start a business, and it fails, coming back in will be much harder. Your work history stalls, your network gets cold, and your confidence takes a hit. If you keep even a part time job, you keep income, structure, and connections while you experiment.\n\nUse the seventy thousand to remove pressure, not to replace income. Let your business grow slowly and organically on the side. Test ideas, try small bets, learn what actually works for you. When the income from your business is consistently beating what you can earn with your time at a job, and it clearly needs more of your hours to keep growing, that is when you quit. Until then, adjust your job, lower your hours if you can, choose something easier if you need to, but do not stop working.",

Sometimes it is 'just' another jira subscription. Sometimes - and I have seen that in practice - it's 'grey server rooms' and 'secondary networking' (think blue cable = company network, red cable = 'free internet without all the firewalls that stop us from doing our work').\n\nThis phenomenon exists regardless of company size.",

Then out of nowhere, she messages me saying she wants to return it because it “looks better at a lower level.” Her exact words were basically that the eyes looked off when she put it higher up.\n\nI told her nicely that I can’t take it back for that reason. The piece looks exactly like the photos, and I’m not a big company that can just eat losses because someone didn’t like how it looked on a shelf. I’m one person making and shipping these myself.\n\nShe didn’t like that. She got defensive, saying my question “didn’t make sense” and that the “advertising didn’t match her hopes.” Whatever that means.\n\nThen she started opening return cases. Three of them. Each time she gave a new reason. The last one? She claimed the item was “defective.” Totally false. Nothing wrong with it, she just didn’t like how it looked where she put it.\n\nAnd guess what? Amazon **refunded her in full** without even checking if she returned it. She didn’t. She still has the piece and the money.\n\nSo now I’m out the cost, the time, and the product, all because someone abused the return system and Amazon just automatically sided with her. No evidence, no verification, nothing.\n\nI reported everything to Amazon and posted about it on the forums because this is getting ridiculous. I followed every rule. The listing was accurate. The photos were clear. And yet somehow, a customer can just say “defective” and walk away with both the product and a full refund.\n\nI’m honestly just fed up. This kind of thing might be nothing to a big company, but for a small artist, it hurts.",

So step one would be to reach out to insurance to make the claim and get that process going.\n\nI have sales records and have been breaking previous sales records pretty consistently. I can present both the insurance and my business records to my bank and see if I can get a loan to cover the insurance gap.\n\nIn the mean time, as a computer professional, I’d continue to provide a service to my customers and the income would continue to flow. Reach out to my customers and see if additional work could be had. Dig in and see if I can find new customers.\n\nOnce the insurance money arrives, I will reach out to local workers to get my store back in shape (depending on the disaster, maybe a new location or just on-line sales).

If the systems are in your head and not on paper and trained well, the 2nd gen wings it, 3rd gen tries to figure it out what’s left of the fragmented system but can’t and it dies.\n\nLike some of those church or social games where there’s a 5 person team doing Pictionary. First person knows what it is and does their best to relay the info to the next person. 2nd person does their best to repeat the info to the next person but along the way the info gets corrupted and by the time the 4th person tries to relay the info, the 5th person has to guess what it is. Most of the time, not even close.\n\nIf everything is systemized well, you pass down the knowledge of not only how to run the business but also the traits needed to run the system. You need to pass the traits to the kids. We see this all too often because owners are not passing the system and the traits to the kids and it amplifies to where the 3rd gen don’t care and they piss away the money. \n\nIf you know as first gen that your system is crappy, I’d sell the business upon retirement, put it in a trust and let it grow from there, let the gens get dividends.\n\nAsk yourself this question. Can you franchise your business? If yes, you have a highly systemized business. If no, get to work, systemized it. This is why you can go to many McDonalds or Chick Fil A, it’s exactly the same. Every person has a duty station responsible for their own station. You must delegate and systemized every single thing. Don’t assume people to know. Can someone pick up your procedure manual and fully run the business without you? That’s what needs to happen to ensure generational business and wealth.",

For that relationship to be successful the previous generation has to set their ego aside and trust the person in the day to day has it covered, and the person in day to day has to leverage the more experienced person when it makes sense.  A parent/child relationship has so much ego tied to it.\n\nI imagine a lot of second generation took over the business because it was their dad/mom’s passion and they wanted to make them happy. By the 3rd generation it’s like ‘wait, so you don’t even really care about this, you just know all the people and everything about it?’\n\nYou need systems and tools in place to manage your business and empower your people to innovate and improve.

The businesses that tend to be most successful or our family own businesses are the ones where the younger generation is required to work in different parts of the company, and not immediately given senior management role right after college\n\nGeneration X my generation might be more guilty of elevating our kids to higher positions of power too quickly in a company … any younger people tend to have a little bit more sense of entitlement than older generations, which is always been the case\n\nBut I can think of a number of very successful companies that are being run by the third generation right now",

As you get to the 3rd generation, control is heavily divided amongst uninvolved members, and or if everyone gets a job at the firm, nepotism reigns supreme and performance amongst family members (who are often managers etc) becomes less important of a metric.\n\nAnother large factor is relationships, as other businesses in your professional ecosystem transition/change so must your own. So while the same business model may be functional over time (this is less relevant today with quicker disruption as a result of technological advancements), the relationships necessary to run your business change and future generations who may have solid operating know how (aka an mba, of years of mentorship) they don’t always have the entrepreneurial spirit necessary to pivot/adapt to ever evolving conditions.",

      "selftext": "Small business has 15-20 employees. Most are part time, and a few are full time. One part time staff has asked if we plan to provide healthcare benefits (plus vision and dental) at some point. She has a daytime / full time job where she is getting benefits currently and said she would like to come over full time if we can provide benefits. She says that her current employer \"takes care of everything\" and that she does not pay any contribution to the plan. So I said I will look into it. For her plus her spouse and child, the total monthly premium on a mid-level package is about $2,200 per month if I did 100% employer contribution. For context she is support staff making $29 / hr.\n\nFor me it's too much of a stretch to justify at $26K annual benefits package for someone whose base is roughly $60K / yr. I could change the contribution rate to say 50/50, but then I'm not competitive with her current FT employer and I think the premium split at 50% would be prohibitive for her and her family anyway.\n\nSo the question is: how do small businesses do this? I know there are a lot of options out there, but for those of you that have been down this road, what did you learn along the way? What was the best option that you settled on? I'd really like to offer competitive comp packages, but health benefits seem especially difficult.\n\nThanks!",

Pay was slightly less than industry/local rates, but it was made up for in those benefits.\n\nWe were bought out by a corporation in December of last year, and they gave everyone a raise (mine was considerable) but went with a much more expensive plan (myself and my two kids are $600+ biweekly, if I added my spouse, I'd be closer to $2k monthly) with a fairly high deductible and coinsurance.\n\nThe thinking behind doing the initial plan made a lot of sense to me.

The policies you can get are similarly priced to the exchange anyway. That way they know how much this shit costs and they pick the plan so it’s not your fault when it doesn’t cover anything. \n\nThe other problem with a plan is you have to have like 80% of people on it and not everyone wants to be. So if you hire someone who’s 60 it’s $1500 a month, but then the 24 year old wants you to “just pay me more” but if they aren’t on it you drop below 80%. Or let’s say you do pay them more and then in 2 years they drop off their parents insurance and want on, but they don’t want a drop in pay. \n\nI sincerely wish I’d have never messed with it. It’s a never ending headache. My employee health benefits cost $5-$8 an hour (that’s employee only, nobody can afford whole families).

Businesses,  unless they are a large group which can self fund their plan may have a chance if they really care out their PBM/specialty drugs. Not only that - but the value from healthcare today just isn’t there. It’s darn near impossible to get a primary care md, appt, much less specialty care. There are options to consider like direct primary care - and concierge medicine where people actually get to see a doctor on a regular basis.  At least there’s some continuity of care. Put it together with a major medical for catastrophic- and you may actually be able to get back to what it was before the ACA fully rolls back. Leverage a CannaRx for specialty meds.   What most people don’t quite understand is that insurance rates are based on a pooled population. The larger the pool, the lower rate for everybody whether you’re buying from the exchanges or whether you’re buying a private plan from a carrier.  Doesn’t matter. So what’s happening now is you’re getting a smaller pool. The people left in the pool pay more. =ALL insured people will pay more. There is no replacement for “Obamacare”  and it’s pretty clear the “concepts of a plan” is nothing.  So what’s the solution? Either talk to a broker about self- funding- to be safe you should have about $250k to even have that discussion. The other option is a voucher - not sure how fast that’s all getting repealed. You should talk to a small market broker. As a small employer- things are just getting more difficult (tariffs - direct and indirect impact), labor crunch-immigration, and this is one more measure to make it harder to retain good talent. I’m sorry. I had 3 locations and just shuttered 2 because of all of the above. Last year I saw the writing on the wall and re-og’d. We had to get nimble, reorganize and leverage tech instead, which is what we were trying to avoid at all costs. Not good but it was better than losing everything.

Crafting a unique selling proposition (USP) that differentiates your SaaS.  A great book on that is Positioning by Al Ries.  Offer is the most neglected area that I see businesses avoid.  They think the thing they sell, should sell itself.\n\n2. Awareness.  Getting your offer in front of your favorite kinds of customers until you've reached 100% market saturation.  Awareness is the 2nd most neglected area that I see businesses avoid.  They think the thing they sell, should sell itself.\n\n3. Delivery.  Building a product/service/system that around that offer.  Most businesses put almost all effort into this area and think that it is the Offer and since it is the Offer that word-of-mouth is the Awareness.  They think the thing they sell, should sell itself.  That's incorrect.\n\n1. Offer - Identify the problem and favorite customer.  Test the idea, before building if you can.\n\n2. Delivery - Build the thing that solves the problem.\n\n3. Offer - Create a USP.\n\n4. Awareness - Promote, promote, promote.\n\n  \nHope that helps.",

I don't know if the the companies hire someone to bot reports or do the reporting themselves but the approach is the same: a ridiculous number of reports on old posts trying to trigger automatic removals.\n\nThat doesn't work here because we actually look at the posts that get reported. Reporting something that doesn't break our rules but makes you look bad isn't going to cause it to be removed.\n\nIf you as a subscriber have questions about these companies I'd suggest you search the sub to learn about them. If the posts are gone then someone has bullied the original posters into removing them. If you are an OP on one of these I encourage you to hold your ground on anything truthful you have posted. I'll stand with you and defend your right to post.\n\nIf you represent one of these companies you'd be well served by finding and stopping any company doing fake reporting on your behalf.

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nMy wife and I started a small residential cleaning business about six months ago. We’ve done everything we thought we needed to build a real company — and yet, we haven’t had a single paying client so far.\n\nHere’s what we’ve done so far:\n\t•\tFully registered the business legally with insurance and all licenses.\n\t•\tRented a tiny, low-cost office with direct access for equipment and supplies.\n\t•\tSet up a phone line and an online booking system for customers to schedule cleanings.\n\t•\tEven built an AI chatbot to answer questions and help people get quotes automatically.\n\t•\tDesigned the whole brand around eco-friendly, non-toxic cleaning — something we really believe in.\n\t•\tRan ads on Facebook and Google for months, testing headlines, visuals, and audiences. Still zero traction.\n\nAt this point, we’re trying to figure out what’s going wrong — whether it’s our offer, our marketing, or something deeper in how we’re presenting ourselves.\n\nSo I’d really appreciate your honest feedback:\n👉 What would you do differently to get clients for a local service business like this?\n👉 Are there marketing channels that actually work for local service companies?\n👉 When you visit a business website, what makes you trust it enough to book — and what makes you leave?\n\nWe even built a full website and booking system with an AI chatbot — I can share the link if anyone’s open to taking a look and giving feedback.\n\nWe’d really appreciate any advice, insights, or even brutal honesty. At this point, we just want to understand what we’re doing wrong before giving up.\n\nThanks for reading — and for any help you can offer.\n\n– Two tired (but still hopeful) small business owners.\n\nHonestly, I didn’t expect this much support from so many people. We’re truly grateful for the time everyone has spent replying and giving feedback.\n\nMany of the points mentioned are already being worked on , we’ve started making several changes, and we know it’s time to get out there, meet people, and connect face to face. The technical part is done; now comes the most important part , showing up as real people and selling ourselves.\n\nI’ll keep this post updated with how things are going in case anyone’s interested in following along as we make these changes.\n\nBig News   \n\nWe Got Our First Booking! \n\nHey everyone!\nI just wanted to share some great news. We finally got our first real booking after all the changes we made!\n\nIt might be partly because of the upcoming Thanksgiving rush, but I’m sure it’s also thanks to all the amazing advice you shared. Probably a bit of both. Either way, it feels great to finally see progress.\n\nHere’s what we’ve changed since the last post:\n\t•\tThe eco-friendly part is now secondary still important, but the main focus is on quality, trust, and real human connection.\n\t•\tWe removed the onboarding fee (it’s now optional).\n\t•\tWe kept our small $299 office for storage and Google Maps visibility.\n\t•\tWe removed the chatbot so all communication is now person-to-person more real and organic.\n\t•\tWe’re cutting unnecessary costs to stay efficient.\n\t•\tWe started improving direct engagement printing door hangers, flyers, and business cards, and added a QR code so clients can leave Google reviews right after a job.\n\nIt’s still early, but things are finally moving in the right direction.\nThanks again to everyone who commented, shared advice, and encouraged us,\nyour feedback really made a difference.

You are coming into people’s homes and they are trusting you with a lot, reviews are 95% of the battle.

Also post on nextdoor and in local Facebook groups.

I didn’t have a website or chatbot back then, just a clear advert with my cleaning areas, services, and fair starting rates. Within weeks, I got my first few clients, and from there word of mouth took over. That’s really how I built momentum.\n\nSometimes it’s not about how professional or automated your setup looks, it’s about being visible where your target clients actually are. Cleaning is a trust-based business. Most people want to hire someone they’ve either met, seen recommended, or been referred to.\n\nHere’s what helped me and what I’d recommend:\n\n1. Advertise locally.\nPost on Gumtree, Facebook Marketplace, and Nextdoor. Keep your message simple and friendly. List your area, what kinds of cleans you offer (regular, deep, end of tenancy, etc.), and your starting rate. People don’t always want to fill long booking forms — they just want someone who can come soon and do a good job.\n\n\n2. Join cleaning groups.\nFacebook cleaning business groups and cleaner referral groups are gold. Try ones like Professional Cleaners UK, Cleaning Business Owners Network, or your local “Cleaners in [your city]” group. You’ll get tips, referrals, and sometimes subcontract work when other cleaners are overbooked.\n\n\n3. Be bold with offers.\nIf you can afford it, offer an introductory discount , for example:\n\n&gt; “First 5 clients get a 2.5-hour basic clean at cost price.”\nIt gives people a reason to try you and helps you build reviews, photos, and trust.\n\n\n\n4. Build local relationships.\nI made a point of getting friendly with concierge staff in apartment buildings. That alone opened a lot of doors because they often know who’s moving in or out and can recommend cleaners on the spot. Drop them your card or a flyer, and thank them if they send someone your way.\n\n\n5. Collect reviews and photos.\nAfter every clean, politely ask clients if you can take a before-and-after photo and if they’d mind leaving a short Google review. That builds your credibility fast.\n\n\n6. Stay active on your Google Business Profile.\nUpdate photos, respond to reviews, and post occasionally. Even one or two good reviews can make a huge difference when people search “cleaner near me.”\n\n\n\nYou’ve done the hardest part already, setting up the structure. Now it’s about visibility, networking, and trust. Once you get your first few jobs and people see your results, it snowballs.",

          "body": "Bottom line is you did things sort of backwards. Frankly, so did I and so do many of us and it's very correctable.\n\nThe core issue is you expanded business overhead (added costs) before having the revenue to pay for it (paying clients). I imagine you did this thinking an office, website, and social presence were necessary for getting work - that when someone was looking for a cleaning company they would want to see a level of professionalism and, well, success! But that is not how clients measure most service industries.\n\nIf I asked you what the most important factor is in hiring painters to paint your bedroom a different color, you would probably say \"doing the job right and without issue\". Does this relate to their office or their website experience? You likely see the error at this point.\n\nSo brass tacks, this is a list of things you can do to get your business up and running: (1) Get business cards, (2) Go to referral groups (google these) and hand out cards, (3) find your local chamber of commerce and go to their mixers and hand out cards, (4) ask your family or friends if you can do a cleaning for them for free to get some before and after pictures, (5) post said pictures online, (6) ask family and friends to leave google reviews for you, (7) consider terminating your office lease until you have so much business going on that you MUST have an office with dedicated staff, (8) post cleaning memes (yes, really - don't take yourself seriously).\n\nWhat you should expect is to get alot of \"interest\" initially but few inbound phone calls or emails. Focus on meeting people, giving them a reason to try your service, and maintaining that relationship. Over the next 90 days, I would expect that you begin to collect a modest group of repeat customers.",

The ground work you've done will help with the appearance of legitimacy when someone you've contacted looks to see if you're a scammer or not, but it won't likely do much to bring in business on its own.\nThis is one of those times when going old school may be your best approach to getting off the ground. Target what kind of businesses you want to work with and go shake some hands and make your pitch. All it takes is for one to be unhappy with their current crew, and you will have your first client.",

They all claim to have the exact, niche experience I need.  If I ask them any questions regarding something technical, they give the correct answers...\n\nSo, I’ve made a new, 100% non-negotiable rule: A brief video call. No exceptions.\n\nA quick video call will give me a lot of info about the potential hire... \n\n1. It weeds out the fakes. The person sending flawless, scripted messages almost *always* crumbles when I ask them a basic question in real-time.\n\n2. It's a \"vibe check\" for cultural fit. My brand has a very specific audience. I need someone who gets the \"swag\" and lingo. I can tell in 60 seconds of a live conversation if they *genuinely* get it or if they just studied a script.\n\n3. It verifies their professional setup. You would be shocked at how many people I've gotten on a call who are trying to do their job from a phone. So if I am paying an hourly rate, I cant afford an inefficient setup.\n\n4. It verifies their tech. If the video call is choppy and they tell me they're \"on 4G,\" and I ask them if they can connect to an actual wifi or ethernet lan, and they tell me they don't have that... Red Flag...\n\nIt's a huge change from how I hired back in 2005, but it's the only way I can find real, professional talent.\n\nSo, is it just me? Or have you all had to do this too?

      "selftext": "This is based in Ontario, Canada 🇨🇦 \n\nI am not mentioning names because I do not want legal issues, but I need to get this off my chest.\n\nA while ago I started providing cleaning services for a couple who owned an Airbnb. The husband acted like a big entrepreneur and constantly talked up his plans. His wife was an influencer with millions of followers. I barely ever spoke to her and she never communicated with me, but he kept bringing her up as if her follower count meant their business was legitimate.\n\nHis business partner was a realtor and the two of them acted like they were on the verge of building a large real estate empire. They told me they were buying 13 properties in Orlando and said I would get all the cleaning contracts. I run a cleaning agency and handle hiring, interviews, scheduling and operations, but I still let their hype get to me.\n\nLooking back, it is embarrassing how much I believed them.\n\nThey pushed me to lower my prices and told me I would make more long term because of the volume they would bring. Lower rates meant cleaners made less money and did not want to work their job, which caused constant staffing issues. They did not care. They just wanted cheaper labor.\n\nThey nitpicked everything. Small towel marks, tiny smudges, anything they could point to. One time four towels were slightly dirty. Instead of washing them, he ordered more than two hundred dollars worth of towels and cloths without asking and then made me pay him back for the order. He acted like he was helping me by explaining how to claim the HST.\n\nHe often acted friendly and gave me advice as if he was mentoring me, then switched into being demanding and controlling. The most insulting thing he said was, “You should not run a cleaning business if you are not a cleaner.” I run a real agency. I am educated and I manage the business. I do not need to personally scrub toilets to operate a company. His comment showed he did not respect what I built.\n\nSomething important is that during this time I kept asking him about Orlando. I told him I was planning to open a branch there. I told him I was hiring people. He knew I was taking the opportunity seriously and believed what he said. Despite that he kept lying about the 13 houses and the future work. He watched me prepare for something that did not exist.\n\nEventually my only Hamilton cleaner quit and after more than thirty hours of interviewing and reviewing applications I realized the entire situation was a dead end. Their budget did not match their expectations and every cleaner disliked going there. The promises were never real.\n\nI finally sent a formal message ending the relationship and telling them I would no longer be providing cleaning services. They never replied. No thank you. No acknowledgment. Nothing.\n\nThat silence told me everything.\n\nHere is the interesting part. Because of their constant talk about Orlando, I actually opened a branch there. I hired people and started operating. And somehow it worked. I am now running my agency in Orlando and so far it has been more successful than what I had in Hamilton. I never would have considered Orlando if it was not for their story, even though their own plans were fake.\n\nSo in a strange way, something good did come out of this. I just had to learn the hard way that not everyone who talks big is telling the truth.\n\nHere is what I learned:\n\nPeople connected to influencers are not automatically professional or honest.\nPeople who promise future opportunities often want discounts today.\nFriendly behavior does not mean respect.\nAnyone who tries to devalue your work is not a partner and never will be.\nSometimes walking away is the best business decision you can make.\n\n\n\n\nForgot to add:\n\nThe biggest red flag I ignored was the fact that they dropped their long time cleaner for my company. No warning to her, nothing. They just kicked her out to start using me. She was really good to them from what I heard &amp; only had a minor scheduling issue. Also, the main guy I was dealing with lied to me that “guests are refusing to pay the higher cleaning fee” when he never updated the cleaning fee on Airbnb from $120 to $200 (which is what I charged him). I know this because I checked the listing every day for new reviews. So that was also a ploy to get me to lower the cleaning fee… I’m probably forgetting some things.",

I feel like there are so many incredible men out there who just need a little guidance with style and environment.\nA lot of guys spend money on dating or communication coaching, but then when a woman actually comes over, the space feels off. The lighting’s harsh or too bright, there’s no music, maybe it smells a little stale or feels cold (literally and emotionally). It’s not that they don’t care, it’s just that no one’s ever taught them how to make a home feel safe and inviting.\nSo I’m thinking of creating a course or guide that teaches men how to transform their space on a budget for under $250 using simple sensory design: lighting, scent, warmth, music, and personal touches.\nI’m also a licensed massage therapist, so I could include a section on the basics of slow, safe, intentional touch to help men understand the connection between physical environment and emotional comfort.\nDoes this sound like something people would actually pay for or be interested in? Any thoughts on how to structure it as a course, digital guide, or coaching?\n",

This all just sounds like what an interior designer would do but just male focused.\n\n...so yea, it depends on how you plan to market it.\n\nThe way you explain it in the post, I feel, makes it seem unappealing and unnecessary (to clientele/men). You may need to shock men into thinking they can't keep a girl without you. I believe in you! Make it undeniable and irresistable. Good luck.",

I think $250 will be a tall order for budget conscious people though unless you actually spend a lot of time setting their place up. Design in general is a tricky space that's hard to do on a budget. A lot of people with small budgets are not willing or capable of valuing your insights. The people who would value your insights tend to be willing to pay thousands for it, but they'll also expect a high level of execution and be coming at you from a much more challenging problem to solve (going from a place that is decent to one that truly sings).\n\nI do like the idea of in general, a PSA existing to help guys be better?

A man can't be everything. This is usually something that women bring to the table. The female touch.\n\nIt's strange that women don't take up the task. I had women offer to give my house a makeover.\n\nWhether it's possible to convince the man that needs this service to spend money on will be a challenge. Their house is cold for the exact reason that they simply don't see it or they see it but not as a big problem. So they might welcome a solution. But they don't value it appropriately.\n\nI know women that have really nice houses. Cozy, bold, even though they themselves say it's a mess I can see that it's her mind that has shaped it with all the choices she made over the years in what she will and will not have in her house. It reflects her personality. It's an art form.\n\nIn that way it will be a risk for a man to hire a service to do this. Since when it's a women she will bring her personality into his space.  He will end up with a interior that is thoughtful but not necessarily bespoke to him.\n\nWhen we then have his dates visit his house they will recognize the work but they will also instantly know that it's not his interior but simply bought as a prop.\n\nSo making a course is way better then to take everything out of his hands.\n\nI think you should partner with other women who like different styles, have them present moodbooks etc so clients can choose in directions they like.\n\nYou could make it in an app. Maybe start by swiping to pinpoint what directions are best first and then expand. You have to present it in a way men like.\n\nOh and since men will be hard to convince to spend money on it, why not make giftcards so women or anyone can give it as a present. Then you get your pay and it's paid for by the women / acquintances who do see the value of your service.",

We keep getting leads from bigger companies with actual budgets but they all send these vendor questionnaires asking about SOC 2 and GDPR\n\n  \nI asked in a founders group and got completely different advices because half said you HAVE to get SOC 2 before enterprise or you're wasting time and the other half said focus on product first and do compliance when forced to. When did you actually tackle this stuff? Year one? Only after hitting certain revenue? I just need to know if we're behind or if this is normal. Appreciate it!",

We sell into SMBs, Midmarket, and through resellers MSPs/MSSPs/Partners etc... our security awareness platform took us 5+ years to develop into anything with Product Market Fit (PMF).  Then we iterated over the last 6 years into something that we're proud of, something disruptive.\n\nNow that we're selling into Mid-market and planning for Enterprise sales we are securing our SOC2 Type II audit opinion (Q1 2026).  We're in heavy preparation mode now.  While we still don't truly need it, the expansion into midmarket and enterprise will be much easier if we can hand over our SOC2 audit opinion when pursing this business.\n\nThere IS enormous value for us in securing the SOC2. It has many strong prescriptions in it for the Security Controls such as penetration testing, endpoint protection, documented processes around change and incident management and so much more.  We do all these things as part of our vCISO service offering.  We even have helped others secure their SOC2 type II audits, but it was time for us to ensure everything was buttoned up in our own business and get the audit.  It helped focus our existing processes and refine them into truly operational procedures we follow.\n\nThe costs of SOC2 assessments have been coming down as well.  Traditional vendors like Drata, Vanta, SecureFrame, or you can save some time and money with some new AI start-ups (do your homework please).  One AI based startup in the SOC2 space is Delve.  We've gone with them and they are pretty responsive to our questions, and their value proposition was amazing in comparison to the larger more traditional Tooling vendors.\n\nUltimately, you can say no.  Just be prepared to get a lot of TPRM (Third Party Risk Management) questionnaires, and be sure to DO what you SAY YOU DO in your answers (they will check and ask for evidence until your get an Auditor confirmation of things in a SOC2 Type II).",

The revenue you get from enterprise customers can't just be from increased scale. The value you're delivering to enterprise customers is magnitudes greater than the value you're delivering SMBs, so your price better reflect that. Most enterprise companies asking for a SOC2 certification aren't procuring quick enough for it to cause major heartburn, and if you tell them you're in the process of getting it (once you find someone champing at the bit), they'll most likely be patient in waiting it out.",

It's one of those things you don't need to do until you need to do it. The cost and time sink can be brutal early on. What I've found with most startups I've worked with is that most enterprise clients will send you a security questionnaire anyway, and SOC 2 is just one tick box - they still want to know about your encryption, access controls, developer training, all of it. So make sure your fundamental security is watertight first, then consider SOC 2 when you're actually losing deals without it. You'll know when that happens - suddenly every enterprise client will be asking for it.\n\n\\- Luke @ Baremetrics",

He was an M&amp;A broker and claimed breach of contract for $1m in damages on a $20m sale. \n\nHe cleverly requested a jury trial instead of a judge trial since thats the plaintiffs right too choose.\n\nHis whole case was based on a verbal contract even though all he ever did was exchange about 8 emails with the owners and sat in on one meeting. The jury ultimately decided this was enough to establish a verbal contract and voted unanimously after 10 minutes of deliberation to award him $1m -- I shit you not.\n\nVerbal contracts do hold up in court. I would assume you have emails and history to prove the same? I would advise consulting with a different attorney that knows contract law -- ideally on contingency if you feel like you have a strong enough paper trail.\n\nGood luck and dont give up just yet!",

I was in charge of much of the finance. He would talk to his clients, tell them not to worry about this months bill, or tell me not to worry if they didn't pay, we would collect next month. Some of his clients owed over $100k, but most $30-60k. I wrote him emails, outlined my concerns that those clients didn't need us as bad as we needed them, that their balances were too high, that we couldn't swing those kind of outstanding balances. Every month was a struggle to make payroll but he wanted to believe and wanted other people to believe that money wasn't a big deal. \n\nAnyways fast forward, all those people stiffed him. His accounts receivable was nearly $400k when I quit. All the people who I said were going to walk out on their bills did. He is an attorney, and even tried taking one of those clients to court, and so far it has backfired spectacularly. \n\nMoral of the story is you don't work for free. The minute someone stops paying is the minute the work stops. None of those clients are your friends. You do work for them, and they pay you.",

Multi-state taxes, off-cycle adjustments, and benefit integrations can reveal how flexible (or rigid) each system really is. The biggest lesson most teams learn is that setup and early data accuracy matter way more than the brand itself. Once you get past onboarding, success depends on how clearly your internal process is defined and how responsive support is when mistakes happen.",

          "body": "The secret to success in a paper/stationery store today is creating an experience and community that online retailers can’t replicate, while being strategic about your product mix.\n\nHere are the key elements:\nFind your niche identity. Don’t try to compete with Amazon on basic office supplies. Instead, become the destination for something specific: beautiful Japanese stationery, bullet journaling supplies, luxury fountain pens, eco-friendly products, or locally-designed goods. People will travel and pay premium prices for specialty items they can touch and test.\n\nMake it tactile and experiential. Your biggest advantage is that customers can feel paper weights, test pens, see colors in person, and discover products they didn’t know existed. Create testing stations, offer workshops on calligraphy or bookbinding, host journaling meetups. The store should be a place people want to spend time, not just transact.\n\nBuild community. Stationery enthusiasts are passionate and congregate online, but crave real-world connection. Become a hub for local artists, students, planners, and writers. Host events, feature local creators, maintain a social media presence that celebrates your customers’ creativity.\n\nCurate thoughtfully. Stock what big boxes don’t: independent brands, imports, artist collaborations, and products with stories. People shopping small want to feel they’re discovering something special.\nDiversify revenue. Add services like custom printing, monogramming, gift wrapping, or even a small café corner. Consider subscription boxes or strong online/local delivery to supplement foot traffic.\n\nThe stores thriving now are destinations with personality, not just retail spaces. With this in mind, you can add a complimentary business within the space.\n\nA complementary business can drive foot traffic, increase average transaction value, and make your space a destination. Here are some winning combinations:\n\nCoffee/Tea Bar - This is probably the most natural pairing. People browse stationery, then sit with a latte to journal or write cards. It encourages lingering, creates ambiance, and the profit margins on beverages are excellent. You could even theme drinks around products (“The Moleskine Mocha”).\n\nPrint/Copy Services - Custom printing, business cards, invitations, zine printing. You already have paper-loving customers; offer them services too. Wedding invitation consultations can be particularly lucrative.\n\nGift Wrapping Station - Not just supplies but a premium wrapping service. During holidays this could be a significant revenue stream, and it positions your store as a gifting destination.\n\nBookstore/Book Section - Small press books, local authors, beautiful editions, journals and planners. The customer overlap is nearly perfect, and it extends browsing time.\n\nArt Supplies Corner - Watercolors, brush pens, sketchbooks. Many stationery lovers also draw or do hand-lettering.\n\nVinyl/Record Selection - Sounds random, but hear me out: both attract collectors who appreciate physical media and craftsmanship. Creates an interesting vibe and crossover appeal.\n\nWorkshop/Event Space - Rent it out for small meetings, creative workshops, book clubs. Generates income during off-hours and builds community.\n\nThe best choice depends on your interests (you’ll be managing it!), your local market gaps, and your space constraints. What draws you? Or what’s missing in your area?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

I don't even use the website of the art shop I used to go to, because amazon will get things to me tomorrow, and that's what you're up against.\n\nI think you could really embrace the local community with same day local delivery or similar? Click and collect style service at a minimum.\n\nIf there's room, then obvious complementary services are renting out spray booths, taking order for  3D printing, CnC machines etc.\n\nAnd as cliche as it sounds, if you can find room for a coffee and cake area, you'll find a lot of people who love art shops also love to spend hours in there - providing sustenance at a profit is a fairly logical move. You'll probably find that it doesn't need to be the final work in high end coffee, just something to keep them going whilst they doodle on a sofa or table.\n\nI would also say if you can turn it into something else of an evening, like push the shelves back and have some poetry nights, or comedy, or small live music, basically turn yourself into a arts hub, not just a shop for pencils during the day.\n\nI'll be honest though, this definitely has vibes of art / stationery being a passion of yours, and you wanting to make a living from it...which is great, but is rarely a recipe for success. You really need to know if there's actually a market for it before you commit to anything else, and if you've not worked retail before, speak to someone who runs their own small store, because it's a huge time and money drain getting stocked and opened, and then the hours can be a real bitch, to be frank.",

Started my greeting card line out of my house in 2013; had an Etsy shop and did lots of pop-ups and markets, and developing my wholesale line before going for it full-time a couple years later.\n\nI’ve had a brick and mortar since 2016. Even in a tourist town and having my own line where the margins are much better, it’s still an uphill battle. I’ve taught workshops and have a good social media presence. I was married, and while his paycheck certainly provided the stability to take risks, I’ve worked really hard to keep this thing afloat.\n\nThe space I was in from 2017-2024 was a giant storefront on Magazine street where we had our letterpress studio in the back, visible for people to see us making the cards. Cool in theory, but not enough to justify the massive overhead. The front half of the store was way too big for what we sold best (cards, pens, stickers, wrapping paper), so I filled it with gifty crap that diluted my brand. Required a big team and lots of capital to keep the inventory stocked. High gross sales, but barely breaking even.\n\nLast year, I moved my print studio to a big, cheap warehouse space, and moved the shop to a tiny jewel box in a fancier part of the neighborhood. Pivoted to custom wedding invitations.\n\nThe business is finally profitable for the first time in years. I’m really proud of myself. There’s no rich husband, just a scrappy gal with a lot of creativity.\n\nGreeting cards are our bread &amp; butter. It’s something people don’t turn to Amazon for, and love the experience of shopping the wall in person on their way to an event— and yes, we can gift wrap that for you too!\n\nOur pen wall is a big focus and it’s so fun seeing people light up at the rainbow of Gelly rolls they can try out. \n\nWe have built an amazing community of regulars and meet new fans of the brand every day. \n\nI don’t have all the answers, I’ve pivoted so many times I’m still dizzy from the COVID years. Just wanted to share my journey in case it helps yours.",

You may need to build up your brand first. \n\nThere’s a CUTE stationary company (very trendy) in California that partnered with Target. They sold their planners, notebooks, and even trendy gift wrap paper in target.  I never knew about their brand before and then started to look for it specifically when I wanted a new planner.\n\nPS- I realize this is a long shot for a new business, but I haven’t seen their product and anything is possible :)",

I truly hope they succeed  but today the odds are definitely stacked against them. I’ve been in twice (and made purchases) but they were empty both times. I think they are a bit like bookstores.

Do crazy amounts of due diligence. 1) Check all the similar stores within a 50 mile radius and see how they’re doing. 2) If you can talk to the owners, ask them what problems they have encountered. What’s there busy season/slow season. 3) Get a lawn chair, a paperback, and a way to count the people who walk by your proposed location. Do it on the days you think will be busiest, and slowest. 3) Make a real business plan. \n\nRemember your income is the difference between the price you charge and what the item costs you. A $5 pen you sell for $10 grosses you $5. That’s before accounting for rent, light, heat and licenses/taxes. You might be netting $3. Estimate carefully how many people you’d have to serve in a week or a month.\n\nGet lots of advice from people who have done retail. Good luck.",
