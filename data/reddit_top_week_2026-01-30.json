I’ve been doing it for years and it’s steady because businesses, schools, and organizations always need it. You don’t have to be in healthcare, and once you’re certified as an instructor you can teach on your own schedule. It’s not flashy, but it’s legit, flexible, and pays for a skill people genuinely need. I teach instructor classes if anyone is interested.",

For those who don't know, it’s basically an arbitrage model.\n\nThe Math: You have High-Net-Worth clients who want a \"Plan B\" passport (St. Kitts, Portugal, etc.). They pay huge government fees ($100k+).\n\n* The Real Estate/Legal Partners: These guys handle the actual filing and paperwork on the ground.\n* The Agency : I handle the client strategy and intro.\n* The Commission: Standard referral fees on a Caribbean file are $20k to $25k per family. EU deals vary but often hit €10k+.\n\nThe Pros: The margins are absurd roughly 90% because I have zero employees and no office. It's fully remote. I just maintain the B2B contracts with the lawyers and field the leads.\n\nThe Cons (and why I’m getting out): It’s a \"hunter\" business. If you aren't working the leads, nothing closes. It’s not passive recurring revenue (SaaS), it’s transactional \"eat what you kill.\"\n\nThe Lesson: I realized that while the cash flow is great for a solo operator, I want to build equity in a scalable product, not a service.\n\nI’m actually seeking to offloading my client assets and partner contracts to so I can focus on a new venture($50K)\n\nHappy to answer questions about how the CBI/RBI industry commissions work if anyone is looking at this vertical. It’s a bit of a \"black box\" industry so the unit economics usually surprise people.",

I was just stuck and getting a little burnt. I wasn't aligned in my business, my systems were fatiguing to manage. Too many tools and software costs.\n\n**What I'm building for myself and eventually the broader market:**\n\n* Basically a lightweight ERP that connects all my business infrastructure (payments, client management, product delivery, analytics) in one place instead of 12 different tools \n* Product creation system - lets me efficiently build and sell interactive GPT products, ebooks, and courses without rebuilding the wheel each time. Same backend, different knowledge products\n\n**The result:** I'm generating way more value with less direct effort because the system coordinates opportunities instead of me manually connecting dots.\n\n**My question for y'all:**\n\nIf you're building knowledge products or running a solo business, which of these pain points hits hardest?\n\n* Your business tools don't talk to each other (data lives in silos)\n* You can't see your actual business health without pulling 5 reports\n* You're the bottleneck for everything because there's no system\n* You have no leverage - everything requires YOUR time\n* Your clients/audience don't collaborate with each other (untapped network effects)\n\nTrying to figure out if this problem is valuable to build as a product or if other creators would want to use/pay for or explore any of this infrastructure.",

          "body": "Hi. Interesting points. In my opinion, disparate systems should not necessarily be a problem. Each piece of software potentially has its niche, its strong points, and its drawbacks. The most important is that they have integration points, exposed APIs, at least, to allow you to build some automation. If not, time to move on.\n\nFrom a reporting point of view, again, different systems shouldn't hold you back in an ideal world. There are great (paid) BI tools that thrive on just this - bringing different platforms and systems together, to provide a holistic view. And in the absence of budget, it is totally possibly to build this yourself, in python, using some of the vast viz libraries.\n\n  \nOf course my comments are quite generic, vanilla. So DM me with some specifics. \n\n  \nData always live in silos, even in the best of systems and most efficient of companies. Different roles, rights, privileges. Pissing contests to get to the data, politics that prevent efficient management. So the fact that you at least have all access, god mode, is already a win in my book.",

      "selftext": "Alright so I jumped into the vending machine thing back in July after seeing it mentioned here a bunch. Bought two refurbished machines for about $3,200, spent another $400 on initial snacks and drinks and found two spots to put them.\n\nFirst one's in an office building with around 50 people. That one does pretty well, usually brings in $280 to $350 a month. Second one's at an auto repair shop and it's more hit or miss, anywhere from $120 to $180. After buying inventory every month and gas to go restock them, I'm clearing maybe $130-150 profit. Not life changing but it covers my car payment so I'm not complaining.\n\nHere's the thing though - it's not as passive as people make it sound. I'm driving out every two weeks to restock, which takes a couple hours where i need breaks in between to play on myprize. Had to fix a jammed bill thing once that cost me $85. Someone tried to break into the one at the auto shop but didn't get anything, just messed up the lock a bit. The office building location is honestly carrying this whole thing. If I only had the repair shop one I'd probably be breaking even or losing money. I'm learning location really is the whole game here. Thinking about getting a third machine but I'm being picky about where it goes. Not trying to end up with another mediocre spot.\n\nAnyone else doing this? What kind of numbers are you seeing?",

I am not a professional web developer, but did study it a while ago, so have a bit of background.\n\nI was so impressed with the output, that I thought it could be a tool that other people would use. I bought the domain [www.dryoutside.com](http://www.dryoutside.com) and starting sharing the link in a few places on reddit. Within the space of 24 hours, my website had racked up thousands of visits and I started getting people using my \"buy me a coffee\" link on my about page (which I was surprised about, as I thought it was kind of hidden).\n\nFast forward a few weeks and my website has been picked up by multiple websites and newsletters and is enjoying a global audience, with money trickling in via the buy me a coffee page.\n\nNot enough to go full time with it, but I am impressed that I've been able to spot an opportunity to generate some money from an idea within such a small space of time!",

      "selftext": "8 years on Reddit. Many evenings spent reading here. Not a single comment or post, until now.\n\nThis is the short version of the story of how I managed to get completely carried away and basically managed to get manipulated by ChatGPT in the hunt for a side business. TWICE. Spoiler: not super dramatic.\n\n \n\nShort background. I’m 34 years old, male. Living a good life. I live in a townhouse in one of the nicest suburbs of a large city in a Scandinavian country. I have two healthy children. I work full-time as a property manager at a relatively large real estate company. I’ve been at the same company for ten years. I enjoy my job a lot since I’m good at it. I can work about 30 hours a week and handle the job without problems. I can come and go as I please. I pick up my kids from preschool at 16:00 two to three times a week. I’m social, have many friends. Two cars, huge mortgage, etc.\n\n \n\nThe problem may have been that things have become a bit too stable and therefore boring. My job doesn’t come with any bonuses, there are no unexpected joys in professional life. Sure, I sometimes make good deals that together have built a solid career. But there’s never any big unexpected boost and it no longer really contributes to self-realization.\n\n \n\nThat made me, about eight months ago, become obsessed with the idea of a side income. Preferably a passive one. Mostly to prove to myself that I can, but also to have that small extra income stream. I’m not a computer guy, but like everyone else I’ve used AI to clean up texts, structure things, and handle minor legal stuff at work. But in my new pursuit of income, I let my collaboration with CGPT go way too far, and it eventually led me to some incredibly depressing insights.\n\n \n\nThe first project came more from myself. The idea was to write digital guides in PDF format in the children and family segment. In the first and only product, I summarized different methods of sleep training for babies, compressed into a concrete, concise guide, and had a trained pediatrician validate the content and sign it as a quality guarantee. Not a bad idea, really. And during the project I learned how to start a company, build a simple Shopify site, the basics of Google Ads and Meta Ads, the basics of Canva, etc. Long story short: I burned too much money on ads before I was anywhere near breaking even. The insights afterward were reasonable and, in hindsight, likely, as I among other things completely underestimated the need for marketing and the work it entails. Passive income is not passive when you have to keep producing products and maintaining marketing. By the time I launched my little site, I had spent every evening for three months and had basically completely sidelined my regular job. I was almost burned out.\n\nIn short, I was naive enough to believe I would reach break-even with a product priced at $30 and then let it tick along and later calmly scale without further marketing work. The money ran out after 7 sales (satisfied customers), but I was far from break-even on ad costs. But as said, I learned a lot. Among other things, I realized that I have zero interest in building a brand, being visible, building awareness and community. I want to be completely anonymous. That makes it hard to market products, haha. Also incredibly naive to think that in my very limited free time I would learn what people spend their entire professional lives mastering.\n\n \n\nOne problem I discovered too late was that at some point along the way, I started trusting CGPT too much. From pure IT support it became more about discussing business plans and next reasonable step. I became increasingly frustrated because every time we simulated different efforts and scenarios, it turned out that everything was always more demanding, with more steps, and with worse outcomes. Example, CGPT suggests setting up a Meta campaign in a certain way, says it takes a maximum of 40 minutes and you’ll easily get 40 conversions. Result: irritation, two evenings of work, and zero outcome. Every new suggestion and simulation triggered me immensely and I put in more money and time than I should have in hopes of more sales. The result was that I became stressed, easily irritated, almost burned out.\n\n \n\nI paused the project. Felt much better for two months. Until two weeks ago when I fell back in again. A boring day at work and I started getting excited about the idea of finding passive income with a computer again. In short, I let CGPT run the whole thing from start to finish this time. Suddenly I was on completely unfamiliar ground (I know many of you here are incredibly skilled with digital products and social media—I am not). CGPT guided me to buy three Excel templates on Etsy with extended resale licenses, package them as a system— in my case about product pricing—and sell it on Gumroad as a system. I spent a week on this. Here too, CGPT’s projections were continuously lowered over time; time, cost, and difficulty for each step kept being pushed further ahead. The stress from burned money and workload came immediately this time. Difficulty eating and sleeping. Constantly working towards the launch, hoping that now I can launch, then I’ll let it rest for a while and let the revenue start coming in. In this project I had done zero research. I didn’t even know what Gumroad was. So when the launch was done and I began to realize that it requires extensive external traffic for anyone to even consider buying your product, the flop was a fact. Incredibly stupid in hindsight. But I think I believed it would sit on Gumroad, people would go there, search for my product, and it would sell now and then. But there it sits now. 0 views and 0 sales. $400 in total costs for Excel licenses…\n\nThe money was gone. The energy was gone. And I was so incredibly tired of walking around hoping for things and working in my free time only to be disappointed. I have been so incredibly distracted and not present during these periods.\n\nFor some reason I had never been in this forum before, and to comfort myself I went in and read yesterday. My feeling after reading 40+ posts was sadness and the feeling of being a total fucking idiot. Half of what is written here is exactly the same shit that CGPT suggested I should do as free marketing. I even went as far as to create a new Reddit account, copy-paste some fake helpful comments with the expectation that someone would ask follow-up questions and magically ask for my product. I’m really ashamed… But I did realize fairly quickly that it was idiotic.\n\n \n\nIt’s so incredibly depressing and brain-dead, and when you see the pattern of how many people fall into the same generic trap, you just get this dark and bleak feeling about the world.\n\n \n\nI fully understand that those of you who have followed the developments here more closely over the past few years probably think I’m completely lobotomized. And honestly: I’m not a stupid person and I have fairly good self-awareness. That’s why the realization of how I ended up in these failures came as an unpleasant surprise. In total, it amounts to $2,000, and now I’m going to try to forget all. The feeling of failure and loosing myself is way worse than the money. I’m not sure what I even want to get out of this post. I think I’m looking for some kind of closure and using this as therapy for myself. My hunt for a side income remains. There will be a small pause, though. The drive is there, but I need to find my way back to myself. And from now on, all ideas and plans will come from my own gut feeling or relationships in the real world. As a quiet protest, I didn’t even let CGPT translate this text, so you’ll have to make do with my middle-school English.\n\n \n\nIf you have any ideas that don’t consist of digital products or selling your soul online, I’m happy to listen!\n\n ",

Then had this great idea to create digital products for every service I offer. \n(All in Business Operations) so as you can imagine spent time on that, spent money on the Pro version of Chat GPT, Canva etc , money on signage, business cards and then spent hours getting contact emails and lists from Chat GPT for businesses in my area to reach out to, only for all the details to be incorrect. Hours and hours I’ve spent on this, oh and paid for LinkedIn premium too. So I’d say the output for this has been around $1000. So from say the 2000 emails I’ve sent and 300 LinkedIn message do you know how many people have written back? 0 \n\nI too am at the end of the road.

Honestly it is hard to get passive income as most of the time you have to set things up before and finding clients is difficult. I suggest you invest your money instead, I read that before investing it you should have at least 6 months of savings then when your money is safely in your savings bank account.\n\nThen with your monthly income you can invest it into ETF or S&amp;P 500 funds for example. Invest 100 or 200 monthly in an EFT over 5 years. These are short term investments that yield more money than traditional ones. Or you can invest over 15 years in those that are sort of retirement funds to find them they should be notified with the year of your retirement for example fidelity fund 2046 and here you save every month the same amount over the 15 years or more.\n\n\nAnd if you really want to make money you could sell old items, or cakes you make locally and add a few bucks in your pocket, there is even a guy who started making  income by renting his camping items to those who didn't want to buy some but it is still a bit of work.

      "selftext": "I hesitated to post this because I don’t want it to come across as a “look at me” thing. But when I was starting, I read a lot of posts like this quietly in the background, and they helped me stay sane. So here’s my experience.\n\nTwo years ago, I started an online service business from scratch. No audience, no personal brand, no capital, no insider connections. Just my laptop and phone. It’s a pretty unsexy business, mostly operational, mostly behind the scenes.\n\nIt’s an online, service-based business that helps small to medium companies solve operational capacity issues. We sit somewhere between staffing, operations, and process support. We are based in Australia.\n\n**Year 1: Reality check**\n\nThe first 3–4 months were nothing but rejection.\n\nNo clients and fuck all momentum. Just cold outreach every day and checking my inbox way too often. I seriously questioned whether I was just bad at this, or whether the idea itself was flawed.\n\nWhat made it harder was that from the outside, nothing was “wrong”. The offer made sense on paper. People understood it when I explained it. They just weren’t buying.\n\nEventually, one client came through. Then another. Then another. Growth was slow but real. I was primarily using cold outreach and typically landed 1–2 new clients per month.\n\nBy the end of year one, the business was doing roughly \\~$200k annualised revenue.\n\nSounds fine, but the reality was:\n\n* I was doing *everything* myself\n* I couldn’t switch off\n* Any problem in the business was my problem\n* Time off meant revenue anxiety\n\nMargins were decent, but I had essentially built a job that required constant attention.\n\nA typical day looked like:\n\n* Morning: outbound outreach and follow-ups\n* Midday: onboarding or solving client issues\n* Afternoon: fulfilment work\n* Evening: admin, invoicing, documentation, hiring\n\n**What didn’t work in year one**\n\n* I tried to “work harder” instead of working differently\n* I delayed hiring way too long because I wanted to save money\n* I over-customised for early clients instead of standardising\n* I said yes to the wrong clients out of fear\n\nA few things actively hurt progress:\n\n* Underpricing early to win deals\n* Letting one early client consume a disproportionate amount of attention\n* Avoiding hard conversations with poor-fit clients\n* Confusing activity with progress\n\nMost mistakes came from operating in survival mode.\n\n**Year 2: Thinking differently**\n\nYear two was when things actually changed, but not overnight.\n\nThe biggest shift was how I thought about the business. Instead of asking “how do I do this better?”, I started asking “how does this work *without* me?”\n\nI spent a lot of time studying operators who think in terms of:\n\n* Offers\n* Leverage\n* Throughput\n* Systems\n\nThen I applied those ideas to my own boring, service-based niche.\n\nPractical changes:\n\n* Opened multiple acquisition channels instead of relying on one\n* Hired people to fulfil delivery and admin\n* Documented processes I used to keep in my head\n* Focused heavily on retention and client lifetime value\n\nRevenue per client averages around $1.5k–$3k per month, so growth didn’t come from huge deals. It came from consistency, retention, and not breaking under load.\n\nBy the end of year two, the business is sitting around \\~$800k annualised revenue. The team is now 4 people, and for the first time, I’m not the bottleneck in every decision.\n\nBy year two, the daily routine changed significantly:\n\n* Morning: review key metrics, sales pipeline, delivery health\n* Midday: team check-ins and unblocking issues\n* Afternoon: system improvements or hiring\n* End of day: thinking time (offers, pricing, structure, constraints)\n\n**What surprised me most**\n\n* Boring businesses scale better than exciting ones\n* Consistency beats intensity every time\n* Most growth problems are actually people or systems problems\n* Confidence comes *after* evidence, not before\n* The business grows when you stop trying to control everything\n\n**If I were starting again**  \nA few things I’d do differently:\n\n* Hire earlier, even if it feels uncomfortable\n* Say no faster to bad-fit clients\n* Standardise before trying to optimise\n* Focus on one offer and one ICP for longer\n* Expect the first 6 months to feel pointless\n\n**Final thoughts**  \nI’m still quite far from where I want this business to be.\n\n$800k annualised doesn’t feel like an endpoint. If anything, it’s just the first stage where the business starts to feel structurally sound. There are still plenty of inefficiencies, things that rely too much on me, and areas that would break under real scale. I have much bigger plans for the next year, but I’m also very aware that growth doesn’t come in clean, predictable lines.\n\nIf there’s one thing this experience reinforced, it’s that progress is often a sludge. Long stretches where nothing exciting happens, where the work feels repetitive, where you question whether you’re actually moving forward at all. Most of the meaningful improvements happened quietly, without any sense of momentum at the time.\n\nLooking back, the biggest gains came from continuing to show up during the least rewarding phases. Not when things were exciting or validating, but when it felt boring, frustrating, or slightly pointless. That part doesn’t get talked about much, but it’s where most of the separation seems to happen.\n\nIf you’re early and it feels slow, unglamorous, or heavier than you expected, you're honestly probably on track lol",

It took a while for me to work out what my business was going to do but I think I've found my place in the market. I started the business working at the kitchen table, using my wife's laptop when she wasn't using it.\n\nIt's taken a lot of work for me, especially with a family with three kids and the arrival of number 4 art the beginning of last year. \n\nIn my first year, I worked myself into the ground. I worked day and night. I lost count on the number of all nighters and the lack of sleep was killing me, and having no money with a family to feed, so I just worked longer hours. I wasn't a nice person to be around.\n\nIn my second year, I cleaned up my sleep hygiene. I went to bed when I put my kids to sleep but I would wake up at 4 am to start work at my desk at home. I got some more wins on the board. \n\nNow entering my third year, I've told people that I  probably wouldn't start this business again. It's been too stressful and killing me. \n\nWhen starting a business, people don't realise how much work is involved and the risk you're taking. I knew I had an uphill battle to climb and I put every ounce of effort to make it work. I kept telling myself that 99% of people would have quit but the 1% of people who are successful keep pushing and working hard to win. They push themselves outside the comfort zone.\n\nI'm still solo and avoiding hiring people. This is by design. \n\nI hope this inspires other people who are looking at starting their own business or they are grinding away to one day be successful. \n\nRemember to work smart, have a clear picture of your goals and ask yourself if what you are working on right now is moving you closer to your goals!",

The short form promotes the long form, which in-turn promotes the watch-time growth.\n\nWas super simple too, so more than happy to help anyone.\n\nHave done this before with other channels, so now kind of trying to see new niches and give people my notes (can share to anyone, but not sure if Reddit allows) (maybe I'll post on my personal how to do it).",

Etsy digital products work if you focus on one product type like planners, checklists, or templates and improve listings slowly each week. Affiliate marketing works if you pick one niche and keep posting consistently, otherwise you will see nothing for a long time. A faceless YouTube channel can work too, but it is not quick. There are many options, but consistency is the part most people fail at, so pick one lane, set a small weekly routine, and stick to it.",

I was working full time and didn’t have a lot of spare hours either, so burnout was a real concern.\n\nWhat ended up working for me was getting into the financial services space by starting with an agency, rather than trying to invent something from scratch. It wasn’t passive at the beginning, but it was flexible. I could learn evenings/weekends, work with real people, and gradually build systems so the income became more predictable over time.\n\nWhat I liked about this path:\n\t•\tTime flexibility (you decide when you work)\n\t•\tSkills you learn are useful long-term (financial literacy, client conversations)\n\t•\tYou can start small and scale only if/when it makes sense for your family\n\t•\tOver time, parts of it become semi-passive through referrals and team growth\n\nIt’s definitely not for everyone, but for families with limited time who want something realistic and sustainable, it’s been a solid option for me.\n\nCurious to hear what others here have tried that balanced family life without burning out.",

I’ve been making my living online for well over 25 years and just thought I’d give some time to answer any questions you have about the topics I’m familiar with. \n\nI have multiple passive online incomes from websites like travel blogs to social media sites, to AI Youtube channels. \n\nMy social media site basically runs on auto pilot there’s plenty of members who have been on the site long enough for me to give them privileges to ban people who try to abuse the site with spam or whatever. The site makes revenue off premium memberships. You can pay $10 a month to access more features. \n\nMy travel sites and other informational websites did take years to build but it pays off at the end, even small tourist towns travel guides sites get 50k-100k views a month and they tend to get high RPM around $6. But that’s only $300-$600 a month so you can’t live off just one site. I target what’s called “evergreen” content basically meaning content that’s always going to be useful. Unlike content that needs to be updated everyday. \n\nI have a software website that i developed automation software for repetitive tasks for an example scraping tools etc. The software is subscription based on average $10 a month to $99 a month. This is basically passive besides updating or improving the software from time to time. No advertising just ranking on google for keywords. \n\nI have a YouTube channel that I use AI to make videos, currently gets about 10 million views a week with 85k subscribers it’s not exactly passive income though because I believe soon as I stop posting the views will drop…. I literally make the videos while on the toilet most the time while most people scroll the videos on the toilet I’m making them so I’ll call that passive LOL. \n\nI have a 3D printing eBay business this is passive but you need a wife who ships the products but long as you have that, get a 3D scanner and a printer and start scanning everything we sell a lot of replacement parts for everything from your cars cup holder to your ovens knobs to toys. You also can make this completely passive with some print on demand sites I’ve heard but never tried. We don’t make enough profit off each sale so I don’t think a middle man service would work for us but it could for your products. \n\nBut anyways free to ask away and maybe I can answer some questions.

I have a marketing background so I’m always looking for gaps, and I noticed they have a wholesale tier on their site where you get 50% off if you buy 50 pieces. Free shipping as well.\n\nI just grabbed a mixed lot of keychains and compact wallets. Since they’re small, shipping is dirt cheap and easy to manage. All fits in a small shoe box. :) The best part is that they don't even sell on eBay or Mercari—they aren't even on Amazon. They seem to focus on big events and trade shows for wholesale instead.\n\nI just listed the stuff under their retail price and it moved fast. It feels like it’s still early days because nobody really knows about them yet. I’m sure eventually they’ll raise their minimums or jump on the platforms themselves, but for now, they don't seem to care about the online side. I'm just riding it while it lasts.",

I run a financial services agency, and what surprises me the most isn’t necessarily a “small idea” but the scale of opportunity most people overlook. Over the next 20 years, an estimated $84 trillion is expected to move between generations—and most families don’t even realize it’s happening.\n\nDo you know what’s missing? The people trained to guide them. Through recent surveys, we see that nearly 40% of financial professionals are nearing retirement, and there aren’t enough new ones stepping in.\n\nSo, even simple strategies or guidance can create both passive income and a huge impact—because being prepared to guide families through this wealth transition is becoming one of the most overlooked opportunities out there",

Anyone legit will comment publicly.\n\nFor actually earning online, tbh the \"never do 9 to 5\" thing is kinda idealistic when you're just starting. Most online income takes time to build up. Surveys are flexible and you can start immediately. I use a bunch of different ones and make around $300/month, not enough to live on but it's something while you figure out a bigger plan.\n\nIf you want actual sustainable income, you kinda need to pick a skill and get good at it. Freelance writing, video editing, web development, graphic design, whatever. Then use Upwork or Fiverr to find clients. But that takes months to build up to livable income. The people making real money online either spent years building it or had capital to invest upfront. Just being real with you so you don't waste time chasing get rich quick stuff.",

I’ve been doing it for around 2 years now and so far it’s worked fine for me, but it’s not set-and-forget and definitely not for complete beginners. You need some real investing experience and basic crypto knowledge to even evaluate it properly.\n\nIn the end there’s no universal answer it depends on risk tolerance and how much effort you’re willing to put into understanding what you invest in.

          "body": "You’re already in a strong position for 23. With solid savings, HYSAs, and index investing, the biggest wins now come from staying consistent and growing income over time. Be cautious about adding complex or risky investments just to “do more.” Focus on maxing tax-advantaged accounts, keeping things simple, and only branching into things like real estate or side businesses if you have a real interest or edge.\n\nFor your HYSA, I’d advise keeping it focused on liquidity and stability, not squeezing every last basis point. The HYSA should act as a safe parking spot for emergency funds, short-term goals, and money waiting to be invested. I personally use a tool like Bank Truth to compare savings rates to make sure my emergency fund earns something while I invest. Make sure it’s FDIC-insured, easy to access, and has no fees. It’s okay if the rate moves over time. What matters is that the cash stays accessible, earns reasonable interest, and doesn’t tempt him to take on unnecessary risk.",

It's not huge but it's legit and you can do it whenever you have free time. The key is being selective about which surveys you take, some pay like $0.30 for 15 minutes which is garbage, but if you stick to the better paying ones it adds up.\n\nJust manage your expectations though, you're not gonna make thousands from your phone. It's more like beer money that can help with small expenses. But it's better than the clickbait stuff you've probably been seeing on Google.",

          "body": "YouTube has been pretty good for me, not entirely passive but between ad revenue and affiliate income I make around $1200 a month with about 50% of my views each month coming from my old video library. \n\nI’m not a huge fan of survey apps but do use 1Q, Google Rewards, and Meta Viewpoints. 1Q is usually only 1-5 questions and pays between $0.25-$1.50 per survey, the main reason I like it is every survey pays and it pays right away via PayPal (DM me if you want a referral link, referrals pay me $0.25 as well). Google rewards usually has surveys based on your search history and pays $0.15-$0.75 per short survey with a low threshold for payouts ($2.00). Finally Meta Viewpoints rarely has surveys but when they do, they are almost always $5-$10. They are all small but don’t have a bunch of qualifying surveys that don’t pay and have made a few hundred from them. \n\nAs far as true passive income, I try to put some of the money I earn from the other stuff into dividend stock portfolios that pay monthly (Mainly SCHD, JEPQ, DGRO, Main and O). I reinvest the dividends every month for now so I can continue to grow my dividend income in the future.\n\nI occasionally try out other side hustles but nothing super consistent.",

      "selftext": "last year, i was sending 100+ cold emails a day to local businesses with bad websites. reply rate? maybe 2%. most of them never even opened the email. i was spending hours crafting messages, following up, and getting nowhere. it was demoralizing.\n\n\n\nthen i had an idea. what if i could show them a working demo of their own website, personalized just for them? not some generic link they’d ignore. something they’d actually watch. so i built a system that does exactly that.\n\n\n\nfirst, i set up a website template that pulls all its info from a google sheet. business hours, services, prices, everything. if they edit the sheet, the website updates instantly. no developer needed. that part alone got their attention.\n\n\n\nbut the real game-changer was the video. i automated a 60-second clip that shows their google maps listing, the website i built for them (with their business name plastered everywhere), and me editing the google sheet live. the website updates in real time on screen. it’s like magic. suddenly, my reply rate jumped to 15-20%. people actually responded.\n\n\n\nhere’s how it works now:\n\n\\- every morning, a script finds 100-300 local businesses with terrible websites.\n\n\\- ai builds a professional site for each one, connected to a google sheet.\n\n\\- a video renders showing their business name and the demo.\n\n\\- an email sends automatically with the video attached.\n\n\n\ni spend 1-2 hours a day replying to interested businesses and closing deals. the rest runs on autopilot.\n\n\n\nthe setup took about 2-3 weeks. i had to build the website template, set up the google sheet connection, and automate the lead gen, video rendering, and email pipeline. it wasn’t easy, but it was worth it. now i’m making $500-800 per deal, mostly from plumbers, dentists, cleaners, and other small businesses where i can reach the owner directly.\n\n\n\nthis isn’t completely passive. i still have to handle replies, hop on calls for bigger deals, and troubleshoot if something breaks. but it’s way better than sending cold emails all day and getting radio silence.\n\n\n\nif you’re curious, here’s what i used:\n\n\\- a google maps scraper for leads\n\n\\- an ai website builder with api access\n\n\\- google apps script or make/zapier to connect the sheet\n\n\\- a video rendering tool (i use \\[tool\\])\n\n\\- a cold email platform\n\n\n\nmy advice? don’t automate on day one. test it manually first. find 10 businesses with bad websites, build them sites, record the videos, and send the emails yourself. see if anyone bites. if they do, then automate the boring parts.\n\n\n\nsome common questions i get:\n\n\\- \\*how technical is this?\\* moderately. you’ll need to understand apis and basic scripting. not beginner-friendly, but not rocket science either.\n\n\\- \\*how much should i charge?\\* $500-800 one-time works. some people do monthly retainers, but i prefer the one-time fee.\n\n\\- \\*is this saturated?\\* no. there are millions of local businesses with terrible websites. plenty of room.\n\n\\- \\*how long until it’s profitable?\\* about 2-3 weeks to build the system, then another 2-4 weeks to close your first deals. not a get-rich-quick thing.\n\n\n\nhonestly, this is a 6/10 on the passive income scale. it’s not “make money while you sleep,” but it’s “make money with 1-2 hours a day after building the system.” if that sounds good to you, i’m happy to answer questions about how i set it up.",

I work at an edtech startup, and we’ve already received a similar demand internally: creating personalized demo videos from our product to improve conversion rates. Unfortunately, it’s not a current priority for us, but I’m very curious about your approach.\n\nTo me, the most challenging part seems to be generating personalized videos at scale, especially showing each business’s website and live edits.\n\nCould you share more details about how you build this video automation? What technologies or tools are you using for the recording/rendering, and how does the personalization work in practice?",

You should develop your own materials for sale and market them. Essentially, you'll need to build a business around yourself. Most people don't have the time and energy to do that, and will simply try their best using the platforms available. But as of right now, it's no way to make a living.

      "selftext": "When I first started looking into online marketing, I was honestly just trying to escape the 9–5. I didn’t really know who was legit and who wasn’t—I just knew I wanted out.\n\nI invested in a course that focused heavily on mindset and taught the basics of building a website. It even came with its own software as part of the package. On the surface, everything sounded solid: build a site, add products, and send traffic to it.\n\nWhere things started to feel unclear was the traffic part. The guidance was basically: post on social media, promote your links, and choose between organic traffic (slow but free) or paid traffic (faster but costs money). There wasn’t much strategy beyond that.\n\nI struggled because I didn’t fully understand how traffic actually works. Organic felt painfully slow, paid traffic felt risky, and I kept bouncing between different marketers hoping someone would explain it in a way that finally clicked.\n\nWhat I eventually learned is that traffic is the business. Websites, tools, and products don’t matter much if you don’t understand how to consistently get attention from real people. Once I stopped chasing platforms and started learning how each traffic source actually behaves, things made more sense.\n\nSharing this for anyone early in the process: confusion doesn’t mean you’re failing—it usually means you haven’t been taught the full picture yet.\n\nCurious what part of online marketing was hardest for others when they first started—traffic, mindset, or execution?",

It was an \"acct review.\" email basically said \"someone disputed a charge, we need to chk if u're a criminal, talk to you in 2 biz days.\"\n\nMy subscription box does about $90k a month. For two days, my store was in \"maintenance mode.\" New customers? Gone. Existing subscribers trying to update their card? Error message. I couldn't even log in to see who was trying to pay me\n\nI spent $1,200 on ads that drove to a dead page. My \"backup plan\" was Authorize .net... which was useless because the entire shopify storefront was disabled. the platform wasn't my partner; it was my landlord who changed the locks becz a neighbor complained\n\n\"review\" ended. no apology. the chargeback? customer lost their card and reported it stolen. bank's auto-system filed disputes for every recent charge. I won the case with tracking. My \"penalty\" was $1,200 in burned ads, 72 lost signups, and the realization that my biz is built on a foundation that can be paused on a whim\n\nso, for the scaled businesses here: what's ur actual, no-bullshit plan for when ur platform decides u're a risk for a day? not theory. what's in place rn that would keep u taking money if ur storefront vanished tomorrow?",

We built tools to scrape emails, tools to send thousands of messages, and AI agents to write them. We thought we were being smart.\n\nBut the result is that now the internet is just noise.\n\nI'm a solofounder. I don't have a marketing team. The logic says I should use these tools to compete with the big companies. But every time I try to scale my outreach, I just feel like I am polluting. The thing is, if you send 1000 emails and get 0 replies, you are not doing sales. You are just annoying people.\n\nI decided to stop with the extreme automation. It feels stupid to do this manually in 2026, checking forums one by one, reading comments, trying to find that specific person that has a problem today. It's slow. It feels like swimming against the current when everyone else is on a motorboat.\n\nBut when I actually find friction and I talk to the person, they answer. They answer because they realize there is a human on the other side, not a script.\n\nMaybe the \"big fish\" can afford to burn their reputation with spam. But as a small builder, trust is the only currency I have. If I lose that, I have nothing.\n\nJust a thought for those who are struggling to get their first users. Maybe the answer isn't a better tool. Maybe is just doing the work we are trying to avoid. ",

Just like in 2008 I see there is this combination of loss of jobs and new startups launched, and this is expectable. In the next couple of years it will only speed up, we will see more solo founders, more people trying to launch a business, and more failure stories. What's different is the scale of making new things: it's so easy now to launch something small, not very data-savvy, and of course it needs AI in it.\n\nOversaturation is coming our way with a crazy speed, many founders price their services cheaper and cheaper, and we all know where it leads. Someone sees it works, repeats, sets the price lower.. It's like a downward spiral we are rapidly moving into.\n\nJust in the last couple of months I heard founders pith one and the same idea in different variations about 10+times, it starts looking like a \"Groundhog Day\" of ideas!\n\n  \nI am very excited about physical products and unsexy startups I'm advising, since at least they have a better chance to stay afloat. Especially devices, robotics, everything linked to meds / personal care, or even food. These have a better chance of a successful exit.\n\nJust Friday thoughts of an elderly person, would be glad to see what are your observations.",

We noticed it's often easier to get cited here over traditional SEO since that landscape is super competitive and companies with the most money usually wins!

I once spent 3 hours at dinner listening to him giving me a line by line breakdown about how much he hated Quickbooks. \n\nThe reason why you hear about crypto, dropshipping, and AI so much online is because most people who think they're interested in making money, are looking for ways to make money without much work. Everything you listed is easy to create a course to sell to those dreamers. \n\nMeanwhile there are thousands of possible businesses. \n\nIf you are interested in a local service business - ask ChatGPT for a list of local professions.

Look at every vehicle that has a business name on it. \n\nResearch \"boring businesses\" - this was the hip entrepreneur term for 2025. It means businesses like lawn care that can earn alot of money but doesn't get the press the way an AI startup will. \n\nAnother option -listen to My First Million episode 779 - about franchises.

But you need to understand those other things.\nI love marketing/sales, would rather talk to customers and potentials rather than anything else. I don’t like accounting. So I hire a bookkeeper to do that and she loves it. But I have a pretty good understanding of the reports and know when someone is wrong.\n\n4.

Your product most likely will be similar to theirs. \nDon’t be an exact copy. Make your product a little different/better. Be willing to be able to explain what differentiates yours from theirs.

It’s a small group of very human skills that compound over time.\n\nFirst is **learning how to learn**. Markets change, ideas fail, and assumptions break. Entrepreneurs who survive are the ones who can admit “I was wrong,” learn fast, and adjust without ego.\n\nSecond is **basic financial sense**. You don’t need to be an accountant, but you must understand cash flow, margins, and how long your money will last. Most businesses don’t die because of bad ideas but because of cash quietly runs out.\n\nThird is **selling and listening**. Not pitching listening. Real entrepreneurs hear what customers actually say, not what they hope to hear, and then shape the business around that.\n\nFourth is **emotional control**. Some days feel like you’re winning the world, some days like you’ve ruined your life. Being able to stay steady, make decisions without panic, and keep going matters more than motivation.\n\nAnd finally, **patience**. Overnight success is usually ten years of boring work. If you’re okay with slow progress and small wins, you’re already ahead of most people.\n\nYou can learn tools anytime. These skills take time but they’re what really carry you through.",

If your buyers need trust, context, or to “get” how you think, socials tend to work better because they see you over time. If you’re selling something more transactional, outbound can still make sense. It’s less about which channel is better and more about where your audience already is and how much trust is needed before they buy. Plus you can always keep them informed of new products and sales etc, look at clothing stores or other physical product businesses, for instance. Never neglect the power of a \"click here to get 20% off your next purchase with us\" in a newsletter.",

AI detatches the human from the creativity of consumed media in any form.\n\nPersonally I go out of my way to avoid content that is generated by AI because it feels inauthentic. So do a lot of others, and it's not a great look when consumers actively go out of their way to consume your products.\n\nI expect AI to thrive in areas where complex static computing often fails. Recognition, manufacturing, decision making, and tooling. I expect AI to fail on anything media related. Unfortunately an absolute shitload of investment and usage is in media generation.

Not here is a day off, but take a long weekend on me, no Slack, no guilt. That one hit harder than cash.\n\nIf you want something tangible, give them choice plus context. For example, a meaningful budget with a note saying use this on something that makes your life easier outside work. Flights, gym membership, a course, childcare, whatever matters to them.\n\nThe common thread is this: make it personal and make it about trust, not productivity.

          "body": "I do elaborate scavenger hunts and parties with prizes for my team. It's honestly so much fun and is so great for team building. If your team is in person I can't recommend it enough, and if they're not then I would honestly arrange some sort of online scavenger hunt or trivia they can work together on. You can give them small, inexpensive prizes throughout and then like everyone else suggested a bonus at the end. \nThis does depend on your budget though. If you don't have the budget to give a decent chunk of change then give them a great experience to show you care.\n\n\nMy staff honestly works hard and despite how infuriating managing people can be, my income is because of them.\n\n\nHalloween this year I turned our business into a haunted house (I do this every year with a different theme/story). For our party I set up an elaborate scavenger hunt where a witch had put a curse on the business and they had to work together to find parts of an incantation they could use to summon the witch who cursed us and vanquish her. Lights out, only lit by electronic tea lights which they had to form into a circle and stand inside of to summon the witch once they found all the parts of the incantation. I had my dad and a friend dress up in some gnarly/hideous witch costumes and scare them. Used blue tooth speakers and some animatronics along the way. Last year it was my BIL hiding in the furnace room with a mask and a machete. Hearing them scream honestly just warms my heart every year. It's honestly so cathartic and they have SO much fun and talk about it with all of our clients and their friends and family.\n\n\nI skipped Christmas this year because everyone was sick but I was going to have a krampus come in and scare them. Saving it for next year.\n\n\nValentines is on the 7th and I'm doing a high tea for them, dress code is the fancier, the better. I've designed a giant galentine's (we're all women) board game for them which is actually coming along and will be so good! They work through toxic masculinity, toxic femininity, women's health and social issues (just board game spaces, not actually and I've kept it funny and unserious) and at the end of the game, the last square is \"Self Actualization\". To get there they have to roll dice, square off in trivia and activities like flip cup, summon each other for help with scavenger tasks where they can all work together to advance on the board.\n\n\nThe board game pieces are instax photos of them that will be taken when they arrive for the party. Small prizes like chocolates and lip gloss, hair clips etc...throughout the game and the winner gets a teddy bear, heart earings, and a tote bag. \n\n\nI share all this because I AM SO EXCITED for it but also because it will cost around $500 and be a great party. It's a team of 10 right now and a $50 cash bonus would really just be lame, so for them this is much more fun with the budget. It gets everyone talking about the business in a fun and positive way. People who don't work for me keep trying to get invites but we are excluuuusive!\n\nTeam does $40k - $50k monthly. If you're creative you can honestly still put something fun together on a scrappy budget. I'm all up in the dollar store for these things.\n\nEditing to add that I also had a fortune teller come in for the Halloween party and do tarot readings for them! Also doing mini photoshoots at the Galentine's party 🥳",

          "body": "I tell people this all the time: starting with zero money is actually one of the best positions you can be in. When you start with nothing, there’s almost no risk. I’ve been doing it that way since I was 14.\n\nThe first thing anyone should do is sit down and write out all the skills they already have. Real skills. Things you know how to do that someone else would pay for. Most people underestimate this part.\n\nFor example, fixing computers. It sounds outdated, but even in 2026 it’s often cheaper to fix a slow computer or remove viruses than to buy a new one. People will gladly pay $100 to get their computer back running smoothly, and they’re happy when they get it back.\n\nI’ve seen the same thing with simple services. A friend of mine started a mobile oil change business using his mom’s van. He’d drop her off at work, post ads on Craigslist, and spend the day driving around changing oil. That was it. Four, five, sometimes six oil changes a day. It worked because people value convenience.\n\nThe point is, you don’t need capital to start. You use the skills you already have and the tools already around you. When I was 14, I used my parents’ lawnmower, walked door to door cutting grass, and reinvested until I had multiple mowers and help. Eventually, we had over 30 yards, and I sold the entire client list to a larger landscaping company for thousands of dollars.\n\nThere are opportunities everywhere. You just have to stop waiting for money, permission, or the “perfect idea,” and start being creative with what you already have.",

I didn't get an LLC until about 5 years ago and and I didn't have business insurance until about 3:00 so I kind of dragged my feet on doing this. But I've always been making money with the business but it was always kind of a here or there thing really. The last 3 years was when I took it very seriously and it's really starting to scale and I made a lot of connections and I feel it's very professional but I had a lot of time where I could test stuff, work it out and just go slow with everything. So I would just say the hardest part is getting started and making money and then as that goes you can always refine it tweak it. Adjust it later",

Plus most companies already had office space leases/new developments being built for at least a decade out - and that would've been a contractual money pit regardless if they were filled or not. So WFH got destroyed at big companies - but I can think of MANY smaller companies and new start ups that thrive on it, some of which I'm involved in.\n\nThe market does want AI... but it's like google search. It's great to have, but the average current consumer isn't going to pay for it unless it's bundled into the price of their PC. This may change with the younger generation however, who could see it as essential. At the enterprise level, however, it's going to be necessary. It really is just too good a tool to not be in use. Not just in white collar jobs, but manufacturing, farming, warehousing, so much more. Is the market still overvalued for it? Yes. But it is something great, even if the general public is worried about how it will affect jobs, dislikes it replacing humans, or w/e. The hype is definitely not dead.\n\nThat said, it also doesn't need to be bungled into EVERYTHING. My word processor does not need AI and software bloat, or if I want it, I can go out and search for that.

The survey, which analyzed responses from 4,454 CEOs in 95 countries and territories, found among its main findings a concern about artificial intelligence. While about a third of CEOs (30%) reported an increase in revenue from AI in the last 12 months, and a quarter (26%) saw a reduction in costs, more than half (56%) stated that they hadn't seen any benefits in either revenue or costs.\n\n\nIf AI is so good, why aren't companies seeing results? From what I've been seeing and researching, many people who work independently or through agencies simply sell you a robot and leave you to fend for yourself. Then they go around uploading videos to social media claiming to generate over $10,000 a month to sell you a course on how to generate that much. But that's the problem: they sell you a robot and leave you to your own devices.

Following the same analogy, end customers need to see AI equally as gold.\n\nThis is where the circle breaks down.\n\nThe reality is you just don't have a population that sees AI with that kind if value.  More specifically, you don't have a populous that's willing to pay gold pricing for AI. There's going to be this huge gap in perceived value likely in the scale of 1/100 to 1/1000, so insurmountable that profit is impossible. No one here is going to spend thousands a year on AI.\n\nIt also doesn't help that the bulk of the invent is in cloud based systems.  The natural tendency for folks getting into AI is to petty immediately spin up local builds running vastly smaller and increasingly specialized models. Even at small to mid size commercial and institutional levels, the early wants starts local, not cloud. It's bad news when many of your interested customer base leans almost immediately towards local build.  And you can't rely on the masses. They won't pay.  They're already getting a good enough for them AI free on their web browser. You're not going to be able to reliably squeeze money out of the bulk population.\n\nSo, do you have left?\n\nWell...governments, big data firms, and a few other unique costumes that will pay good money but can't possibly cover the trillions of costs.  \n\nThere just isn't money on the other end, period.\n\nSome are making big money now.  Many will walk out is this with massive debts.  Many will go bankrupt or get bought for pennies on the dollar by PE firms. Trillions will go up in smoke, and there's no fix for it because of both perceived value and alternate low cost products that ensure there's no pathway for cash to flow back to pay the costs.\n\nMaybe just maybe there's a 50 year bet on this where massive setup costs are expected, and investors are willing to have no profit for decades. Maybe there's a bet that data will be hugely valuable long term. But to who and with how deep of pockets, not just for now but for upkeep and hardware refresh cycles. If it costs $2 trillion a year on average for this indefinitely, how do you build steady income?  The big problem is many functions are largely single use.  Once the customer has the data they want, it's not like you're getting much new data.  The value of what you can offer year after year degrades. The customer can already parse out the bulk they want and leave with it.  You have no way to keep the value or customer in a way that will pay for upkeep.  This whole build has such a short high value window.\n\nThe real value is in the AI models, not the infrastructure. The long term winners well be those who can develop the best, relatively small scale, specialized models that can readily bake into commercial software and hardware solutions.  It's not the big data centers and big AI farms.  It's the business grade software and process focused models.  This is who wins into perpetuity.",

Much the same is going on with AI. Place it as general magic, and there will be resistance. Let it be presented as a total replacement; again, more resistance. When it becomes invisible infrastructure reducing real friction time, anxiety, errors, dependence on others it ceases to be a topic and just gets used. Marketing silence isn’t always failure; sometimes it’s maturity. \n\nI notice, too, that many AI offerings are selling efficiency and results not something you can hold in your hand when today people will pay more for direction, judgment, and containment than they will for pure speed. Technology accelerates, but it doesn’t decide the direction or provide meaning and thus, many offerings fall short.\n\nPerhaps the question is not whether the market wants AI but in which strata of life it permits her entry without resistance. Do you figure adoption rates of AI will soar once she quits trying to be the lead character and just melds into the system?",

They don't really want the product but rather htan say it they'll just make something up(i do it all the time)\n\n  \na lot of people hate conflict. We can sometimes 'exploit' that but I've learned the customers who aren't interested and just are making up excuses aren't the best clients to have long term\n\n  \nthat doesnt' mean we shouldn't try to salvage deals and sometimes it may be a budget issue but normally if someone is interested in the product/service but the price is too high, they'll try to negotiate or say...can you do any better with the price?\n\n  \nin sales some are better at manipulating someones emotions than others. I'm not even really criticizing that. They work to make someone feel guilt over not buying. Years ago my father went on a sales call with someone who actually took out their family picture and said something like, 'do you want my family to starve? I know the product we are selling will work for you so just sign here so I can buy groceries'. \n\n  \nMy father wasn't all that comfortable in that situation but the salesperson he was with was a top producer.\n\n  \nmy point is a lot depend on if they really are oncerned about price or if they are jsut trying to find a way to say no politely . \n\nI see this more when I'm trying to sell an existing client something new. I have a relationship with them and maybe I'm trying to get them to spend some money. They act interested(maybe because we have built a relatinship over the years) but they'll try to find an excuse on why they aren't able to buy without making it personal. I don't guilt them over it\n\n  \nand when it comes to new prospects, I can typically tell fairly quickly if their expectations are set properly. I don't really work off a script so much but do know what to say in certain situations to try to find a way to close the deal. Maybe I should apply more pressure at times but my experience has been that when I really try too hard to close a deal where the customer isn't sure, they tend to be the ones I might have the most trouble with because if they feel a little pressured to buy, they will be more eager to find problems",

After 4 weeks of no feedback (we have many channels in place) she abruptly canceled the contract on 24 hour notice. I'm like shaking with anger because we have busted our ass and complied with every bit of feedback. Like if our communication history was shown in a court of public opinion i genuinely feel our team would obviously be sided with.

As example, customer can say you did not fulfill one part of a contract, and that's the reason they are canceling without notice....are you really going to sue every time over that?\n\nBetter, and sometimes difficult as hell, is to figure out your customers true expectations, not just what's in the contract.  As (negative) example:  If you go to a restaurant and order a chicken sandwich w/o mayo, and they bring you a burger, then you complain and they quickly and nicely replace with a chicken sandwich with mayo, then you complain again and they quickly and nicely bring the correct order.  Restaurants initial perspective is they did supply what was requested in a responsive to feedback and professional manner....but the customer likely sees that situation as a failure (took too many tries to eventually fix).",

It might be worth reaching out one more time to the office manager, just to get some closure or feedback on what went wrong. Sometimes, clients don’t realize the impact of their decisions, and a conversation might provide you with insights for the future.\n\nAlso, consider diversifying your client base if you haven’t already. Relying heavily on one contract can be risky.

Going to this much trouble over forking over, maybe at most, $55k up front would make me wonder if they don't have that much money to theoretically lose and if I'm ever going to see the balance when the goods are delivered. \n\n\n50 up front/50 on delivery is not unheard of for first-time customers to establish credit, and I'd be wary of this much pushback. Make sure to get credit references from them if you're giving them terms!\n\n\nI would say, if that they're that hesitant about just giving you guys money, maybe offer to send them your materials invoices and they can pay those directly, which would come out of the total cost of the contract. I've done that for some of my smaller vendors who have tight cash flow, it happens more often than you would think in manufacturing.\n\nBut mostly, at the end of the day, this is the owner's issue to solve, and if he fumbles the contract, it's onto the next sale, unfortunately.",

They want their financial institution to prove to your furniture company that they have enough funds in their account to cover the $110,000 to make this purchase. When the bill comes due in full, then the bank releases the money to your business. By not collecting a deposit, your boss has agreed to use company funds to pay for the furniture upfront, instead of using the customer's deposit. Does your boss not have enough capital to accomplish the purchase order?  That has nothing to do with securing the bond though, that should have been done with your customer's bank at the same time the contract was signed. You, or your boss, should have received paperwork from the customer's bank at that time.",

Some customers just want reassurance that you're not a fly-by-nighter going to vanish the second they give you a deposit. I wouldn't give a company that much of a deposit that i had not done a lot of business with, especially a small one that can disappear easy. \n\nIf it IS in the contract, then firstly your boss is an idiot for signing it, and y'all may have to pay something to break said contract. Although often, most clients will just break the contract and move on because it's not worth the time to come after you.

We both wake up around 4:30–5am,  leave the house around 7am, and the days don’t really stop until late at night. He’s still a technician in the field managing service calls and two techs. I handle everything else: phones, scheduling, billing, payroll, marketing, reviews, follow-ups, permits, subcontractors, networking, thank-you letters, etc.\n\nOn top of that, we have a blended family with rotating custody schedules, a toddler we co-sleep with (unfortunately), pets, and a household that I largely manage. I do the grocery shopping, cooking, laundry, homework, bedtime routines, appointments, and most of the mental load. We do have a house cleaner twice a month and someone who mows the lawn during the summer season, but day-to-day life still feels relentless.\n\nLately, I feel completely invisible.\n\nWhen my husband comes home, he checks out and doom scrolls on his phone while I scramble to get dinner, manage kids, clean up, and try to keep everything afloat. Tonight, during an argument, he asked me what I even do all day because he doesn’t understand why I don’t have time to move money between business accounts. That comment broke something in me.\n\nWe barely touch anymore. We co-sleep with our toddler, and the little intimacy that we do have feels rushed and more about his needs than connection. I don’t get compliments. I don’t feel desired. I’ve asked to be told I’m beautiful, and it just doesn’t happen. I put effort into showing I care, but I don’t feel it reciprocated.\n\nHe says he’s tired. I am too, but I still show up for him.\n\nWe argue more than we connect. I’m scared we’re going to lose our marriage trying to build this business. I feel lonely even when he’s in the house. Tonight he chose to sleep downstairs, even though we had the opportunity to be close, and that made it hurt worse.\n\nMy spark feels gone. I don’t feel seen, valued, or appreciated - as a partner, a woman, or a person. I don’t know if this is burnout, resentment, or the beginning of the end.\n\nIf you’ve built a business with your spouse:  \n• How did you divide labor without resentment?  \n• How did you reconnect emotionally?  \n• How did you stop feeling like roommates or coworkers?  \n• Or how did you know it was time to make a bigger change?\n\nI’m open to hard truths.

In reality, it is a very rare couple that works well together. I mean, exceedingly rare. I have seen a lot more couples divorce after embarking on a joint venture than sustain it for years. \n\nHow is the business structured? Do you have a well defined role or are you just “helping out”? Do you get a paycheck? Because handling admin for a service based business is no small task. And if he doesn’t appreciate the work you put in, perhaps he should try hiring someone else to do the job. Then he’ll find out that no employee wants to regularly put in 12 hour days “because they care about the business”. They don’t care. After he runs through 3-5 of them, maybe he’ll have a different perspective on things.\n\nBottom line, takes a toll on your marriage. We tried to figure out a way to make it work for years but it was breaking me to have to manage my spouse. If there was tension at home it came to work, and vice versa. Our marriage still hasn’t really recovered and we were in a similar position, co-sleeping toddler too, when we started working together. Thankfully our child is older now but it was rough going for awhile there. You do lose yourself and that connection because you are just getting through the days. \n\nMy best advice would be to define everything about your role down to the last detail, look at a typical salary for your area for that type of position, and show him those numbers. It’s too easy to take someone for granted when the work they do isn’t quantified. But also, consider that a vast majority of couples do not work together or even work in related fields and there’s a reason for that. That much overlap creates friction and it’s not anyone’s fault, it’s the nature of the beast. Once I let go of the idea that we “should” be able to make it work it became much easier to look at the situation objectively.",

Reconnect emotionally is simple but not easy.  You just need to have fun together.  Find ways to laugh together.  That’s a Herculean task when you have businesses and living.  A lot of people like to recommend couples counseling, but with business owners that just becomes another task and rarely works.\n\n3.  Start touching each other.  Every opportunity to hold hands, grab butts, pick lint, bump into each other, get in each others path.\n\n4.  If you are unsatisfied then it is always time to make a big change, but make sure the juice is worth the squeeze.  If you are miserable now at 40 and you do nothing, do you think at 45 things will be better?  You think you are bitter and resentful now, do the same thing for 5 more years.",

          "body": "I feel you. I’m replying as someone who is inside a business-and-marriage like this, not commenting from the outside. One of the biggest shifts we made was realising that the home is another business. If we tried to run it like a “normal household” on top of running an actual company, we would have burned out completely.\n\nSo we outsource as much as we realistically can:\n\t•\tcleaning\n\t•\tlaundry / ironing\n\t•\tfood shopping\n\t•\tmeal prep where possible\n\t•\tlawn and outside jobs\n\t•\tsome personal admin\n\nNot because we’re lazy but because our time and energy are better spent on high-value tasks: in the business, in the relationship, and with our children.\n\nWe did the same inside the business. We invested early in admin and office support because growth (and sanity) required it. Trying to do everything yourself is a fast track to resentment.\n\nThat said — even with help, we’re still exhausted at times. This isn’t a magic fix.\n\nWe also have young children, and when I’m at home I want to be present with them. Not half-working, half-scrolling, half-thinking about what I forgot to do. I still don’t get the balance right but outsourcing the background noise of life gives us a fighting chance.\n\nWhat’s mattered just as much as practical help is alignment.\n\nWe regularly check in on:\n\t•\tAre we on the same page about where the business is going?\n\t•\tDo we agree on why we’re pushing this hard?\n\t•\tAre we both choosing this  — or is one of us just enduring it?\n\nWe take a full day once a quarter to map everything out — business, home, pressure points, capacity. It’s not romantic, but it stops silent resentment building.\n\nWe also talk openly about the pitfalls. Work will take over if you let it. So we’re very intentional about:\n\t•\tno-work-talk moments\n\t•\tno-phone time\n\t•\tactually being present with each other, even when we’re shattered\n\nWe co-sleep too, and I won’t pretend our relationship is top priority all the time. Sometimes it genuinely isn’t. This life isn’t rainbows and butterflies.\n\nBut we make a conscious effort to keep showing up imperfectly, but intentionally. We want to be successful and we want our relationship to survive this season.\n\nSo the question I’d ask: \n\nAre you aligned on where you’re going, why you’re doing this, and what support you’re allowed to bring in without guilt?\n\nIf the structure doesn’t change, the feeling you’re describing won’t go away — it will just harden. That doesn’t mean your marriage is failing. It means the system around you is overloaded.\n\nYou’re not invisible.\nYou’re not asking for too much.\nYou’re just carrying too much without enough support around you.\n\nAnd you’re definitely not alone x",

Different industry, but we share a similar division of labor as you.  \n\nThroughout the years, we have had many of the same struggles. Some of them were natural phases of marriage that I think come along with raising children and being in a relationship for a long time. And I truly think we would have had most of those same struggles regardless of our careers. \n\nIn the business we have had gone through periods (like when our kids were young) that I took much more of a backseat and really limited my involvement as I focused more on the household. And then the pendulum has swung and now that our kids our school aged, my husband manages much more of the household (picking up kids from school, packing lunches, making dinner, etc), while I have gotten to step back in and be more of the point person and expert at work. It has been a really nice shift for both of us to have some role reversal and appreciation for what the other one contributes. \n\nSo although we struggle with all of the exact things you mention,  I think so much of this is a relationship problem. Running a business together can magnify these issues, but they would be there even if you had separate jobs. \n\nHaving a partner who can help share in not only the physical tasks, but also in the mental workload is huge. And although I am sure he is navigating his own burnout and struggles, from your side of things, it really sounds like he is dropping the ball, and the current situation is not sustainable. There is some great suggestions in here on the needed conversations. If your husband is willing to listen and work together to help make some adjustments, I think there is a great opportunity to help you both reconnect, prevent burnout, and improve. You deserve a partner in business AND life who appreciates you and joins along side you.",

You say you’re both busy and somewhat successful, but still feel like you’re constantly trying not to fall behind. That’s a classic trap for service business owners who haven’t raised prices enough to create the margin needed to hire help, systematize, and buy back time.\n\nNot trying to sell you anything — even though, yeah, this would be an easy pitch and maybe I’m off, but let me ask this…\n\nWhen’s the last time you and your husband actually sat down and talked strategy? Not just surviving the week, but real conversations like:\nHow can we be more efficient?\nWhat can we simplify or delegate?\nWhat level of growth would let us both work fewer hours and actually have time for each other?\n\nBecause without those talks, it’s really easy to stay stuck in survival mode — busy, tired, and slowly drifting further apart instead of building something that creates freedom.\n\nI learned this the hard way. My wife worked in the medical field and wasn’t involved in my business, but I tried to include her in my plans for growth and what that could mean for our future. She wasn’t interested, and over time she resented how much I worked. Back then I wasn’t making much, but we paid the bills, ate out sometimes, and took small trips.\n\nWe’re divorced now. She’s still in the same career and as dar as i know enjoys what she does. I went through years of struggle as an entrepreneur, but I never stopped having those strategy conversations — even when it was just me.

It’s about showing how critical intentional planning is and the cost not being can have on a marriage. You rarely know exactly how you’ll get where you want to go, but if you’re not talking about it, defining it, and working toward it together, you stay stuck.\n\nAnd staying stuck too long turns into bitterness.

His responsibility in the company kept piling up, but he couldn't quit because the profits were growing too.\n\nIn one sense, your husband's mentality of \"I'd just go find employment rather than learn your side of business\" is correct. The world would still go around even if you dropped everything right now. You won't lose your house over it.\n\nYou first have to figure out which parts of the job you absolutely hate, and which are alright. The parts you hate have to be delegated as much as possible. If you hate putting in the receipts onto the accounting system, in an extreme sense pay a local kid $40 to spend 2 hours manually typing everything in every month. If you think \"that's expensive\", how much will YOU need to be paid for you to happily do the same job for someone else?\n\nNext, there are a few tasks there that won't hurt you even if you let it go completely. You can let go of social media and review responses. The largest sticking point of a client base is usually having a reasonable job done and any aftercare if a problem arises. They don't care if your Email response is 3 hours late. They don't care how you respond to their 5 star review. The business won't die.\n\nYour husband needs to delegate some tasks too, and reduce his workload. Did you know that rejecting some jobs \"because you are overbooked\" doesn't hurt your business? It simply makes you look popular. Alternatively, raising prices until some clients move away.\n\n\nFinally, discussing family time. Never Split The Difference has good negotiation tactics to get your feelings heard. \n\nThe problem with his \"Why can't you do this, what do you do all day?\" Is that he refuses to see labour he considers free/profit-less. If moving money is that easy, why won't he do it himself? It's because there's mental workload involved. It hurts you because you are drowning with tasks that he admits that it's impossible for him to do.\n\nYou both need more free time to open up the emotional capacity. Remember, you are not doing work he won't do, you are doing work he can't, and you are allowed to switch the off button. Discuss with him that the business will be shut down before the marriage ends, and you're going to save the marriage first. You'll both make changes, and if the business can't function with the new direction, then accept that the business was imcompatible with a healthy family work life balance.",

Then a year and a half ago my company did layoffs, so my husband was super energetic about me working FT for the business and how I’m the secret sauce. I was hesitant because I liked MY own paycheck but 3 months later we got married, 2 months after that January 2025 we got a puppy and that made me not want to physically leave the home. He’s a cavapoo and very clingy. My husband is all for this role. We have been way more successful (by the grace of god) by me working for our biz and we make more then my salary was bringing in.\n\n• How did you reconnect emotionally?\nThis is a good question. I am now pregnant with our first child and during the week “life happens” we both work, he’s on the field I WFH and handle all household operations as well as computer. He also though steps in ALOT and loves doing things for me… he’s always insisting on doing the dishes after dinner, never complains when I don’t feel like cooking, he’s super clean and organized as am I but we don’t have set roles. I do mainly cook dinner but since I’ve been tired due to pregnancy, he’s stepped up and made some great meals even after a hard day.\n\n• How did you stop feeling like roommates or coworkers?\nYou need to designate a weekend date night, make chores fun, even food shopping we love going together, get a babysitter and go out for a few hours just you 2. We don’t have much family here but thankfully my mother is nearby so alot of the time we even drop our dog off to her on Fri night and go out have fun and grab him the next morning and we will be doing that with our child as well. I’m sure there will be harder seasons for sure but maybe also try getting your kid out of the bed in the future so it’s just u guys again? \n\n• Or how did you know it was time to make a bigger change? If we’re out walking the dog we will catch up briefly on work cuz he’s on site all day so for me I call him for a 3 min convo or when he goes to store runs he always calls to catch up and see how my days going. Estimates and typing them always happen after work but we try to get them done one day a week. It’s tough but u both need to want to set boundaries and keep your marriage alive.

If this means hiring new employees make it happen so you can both get your time back.\n\nAt the end of the day family needs to come first, no point just running a business without being able to spend reasonable time with family.  When we overdue putting in too much into the business without properly learning to delegate turns things in the wrong direction as both of you are seeing now.\n\nHave a talk with him and get the delegating done or reduce the service calls to help get both yours time to enjoy life back in order.",

I can only share what we did and what worked - just as some ideas. \n\nOur business is different (manufacturing and e-commerce of those products). I'm the business/e-commerce/customer side, he's the manufacturing side. First, I felt totally burned out (our son was 4-5 at that time). Too much to do, not enough time, nothing was done as well as it needed to be. I decided to do a hard inventory of our business (I went to a hotel for a weekend alone and put up pieces of paper on the wall and wrote all my ideas, etc). Here's what we did:\n\n\\- I focused on two overarching principles: less work but same output (systems and equipment), and \"outsource that sh\\*\\*\"). I started making a list of every single task I handled, as well as the frequency (like \"run payroll, every 2 weeks on Friday\"). I sorted it in two different ways: one was \"time-suck\" - put the most time-consuming items at the top and go down the list. Second one was: what do I absolutely hate doing.\n\n\\-From there I worked systematically through the list. Examples of my time-sucks were: 1) customers calling and rather than asking a directed question, which I could answer in 5 minutes of my time, they would chat and chat and tell me all sorts of issues with their entire project rather than MY part of the project. 2) manually entering all orders into the system and following it through the order workflow.",

This is more of a burnout problem than anything to do with the business itself.\n\n&gt; How did you divide labor without resentment?\n\nThis isn't a high school group project. We're married and part of the entire reason we got married is because we work better together than apart. I'm good at certain aspects of the business while he's good at other aspects. Marriage, and business partnership, is all about harmony. You come together to create something bigger than just the two of you. The moment you start keeping score at all, is the moment you stop being a relationship. Sometimes I really cannot be bothered to do the dishes especially after a long day, and vice versa. You know what we do? We thanklessly and silently fill in each others gaps. He'll cover for dishes if I'm tired and sometimes I'll cover, even though the goal is always a balance that feels \"right\". Both of us care a lot about trying to do our fair share as an innate quality of our character. Sometimes we're both exhausted and the dishes pile up, sometimes I end up doing laundry for a month straight. And you know what? That's ok - what important is that it gets done eventually and we are on each other's team to handle whatever life throws our way. \n\nStop keeping score (and he needs to as well).\n\n&gt; How did you reconnect emotionally?\n\nWe do things for each other all the time. We also go on dates. I don't need to reconnect because I never lost connection. This is a lot easier to if you're not burnt out, which you are because you're working 2-3x more than you should be working. If you can't cut your current working hours in half, you don't have a sustainable business and **that** needs fixed first thing. Hire/outsource, start being smart about your business acumen, stop grinding. If you're grinding and it isn't your first year in business you're doing something wrong and there's further optimizing to be done. Business isn't only about making the numbers grow big forever - you can decide for yourself what success means. It's ok to make less money to have a better work life balance despite what wall street and the money gambling addicted billionaire class wants you to believe.\n\n&gt; How did you stop feeling like roommates or coworkers?\n\nSee above.

Or chase some “secret winning” Meta ad campaign setup that would take my business to the next level.\n\nUntil my mentor told me business is a mirror of your personal self-improvement. The bottlenecks in your business are usually the things you’re lacking as a person.\n\nWhat I was actually avoiding was obvious. I didn’t like talking to people.\n\nI avoided sales calls. Tried to close deals over text. Then gradually went cold when someone wanted a call. I was literally letting go of opportunities.\n\nI was distracting myself with 1% improvements while avoiding what was probably a 400% business growth at that point.\n\n\nI didn’t magically fix it, but this is how I deal with it now:\n\n1. I only work with big high-ticket clients, so the earnings per talking ratio would be optimal.\n\n2. Brought on a sales rep.\n\n3. Reduced impostor syndrome by becoming more of an expert. So that people can’t corner me by asking something I don’t know.\n\n\nHope this helps a fellow introvert out there :)\n",

      "selftext": "We’re at 16 employees and I’m so over our current payroll setup. I won’t name it, but it’s been a pain for way too long.\n\nEverything feels scattered. Payroll is in one place, employee stuff is somewhere else, and when tax time rolls around I’m digging through different dashboards trying to find the right reports. Last year was a scramble and I’m trying not to repeat that.\n\nAlso, every now and then we pay people outside the US (contractors/vendors), and that turns into another separate process on top of payroll.\n\nI’ve been looking at options and they all say the same things on their websites. We don’t need anything fancy. I just want something that runs payroll without drama and makes end of year less of a mess.\n\nIf you’re doing payroll for a small team, what are you using and would you pick it again? Any gotchas when you switched?",

      "selftext": "We own a specialty repair business. It is a dying trade and so we are busy. We have been in business for nearly 50 years, third generation. We are good and knowledgeable at what we do. I believe we are around 1 of 6 shops in our State that can offer the level of expertise and service that we do. \n\nWe did a repair back around Thanksgiving. Normally, the customer picks up their own items. However, this customer lives around 30 minutes away and is in her 70's so we offered to deliver it free of charge as we had another stop in that direction. Normally a house call to her area is $175.\n\nShe has contacted us twice to come back out to her home. We went both times free of charge and both times found nothing wrong. She was not taking care of the item in the proper manner and we advised her of that. We did not charge her for the stops, again we tried to toggle them on existing stops in that  area.\n\nToday she calls and is irate. She is screaming how she paid $450 and the item was not functioning correctly and she was insulted we suggested she was not fully understanding how to take care of it. She additionally started the conversation with \"don't make me take you to small claims court.\" I point out that she has a year warranty and that we generally never go to the customer's home, we did so prior to be helpful...no one is refusing to honor her warranty or assist. I advised that customers generally bring their item back to the shop if they are having issues and we can re-test, re-examine. She carried on she was not driving 30 minutes to the shop and I explained we have customers driving 3 hours to bring things to us. \n\nThis went on for a good 5 or more minutes of her making insults (ie, \"other shops could do a better job\" or \"you people don't know what you are doing\") before I simply said we are done for today, the options are to bring it to the shop or wait until we are in your area which may be a week or two. I advised her threatening, talking aggressively, or making insults is not going to engage us or encourage us to respond or help any faster. As we went to hang up I heard her say \"you bitch.\" \n\nI immediately called her back and informed her that I heard her comment. I told her she was no longer welcome to call our business. I told her I was not going to put up with her hostile and now verbally abusive behavior over something so trivial. I suggested she find another shop to help her (BTW, there is not one for at least 90 minutes). \n\nHave you had similar encounters and how did you handle them? \n\nAny thoughts on how the warranty is handled if you are no longer willing to see the customer due to their behavior?\n\nAs a small business, my other partner said \"great, now we just have to wait for the negative review.\" But my position is, why do we as a small business have to tolerate piss poor behavior from customers, why is it wrong to put your foot down and say \"no more, we are done\".....",

In most of those situations I refund them their money, it’s not worth the headache. Yeah I lose revenue, but the I look at it as paying for better mental health. I also blacklist them on our appointment scheduler so they can’t bring in any other instruments In the future. One of the other things I do is make sure every customer gets a follow up email encouraging them to leave a Google review. This has resulted in hundreds of 5-star reviews for us. The few bad reviews I’ve gotten I respond to directly, and put in a dispute with Google. Between the huge amount of 5-star reviews and a thorough reply to a bad review Google will usually pull the negative review down.

This customer demanded he pay me in full to the point where he refused to even give me his card until I agreed to.  \n\nSo against my better judgement, that's exactly what I did.  I went to schedule his next visit and he told me \"no hurry\" and that it would be okay if it was later on.  And the day that I wanted to come by had inclemate weather, so I wasn't able to come. \n\nHe called twice the next day - a Sunday, which is a day where I'm closed - and then again Monday morning to yell at me.  He made a big point of how he'd already paid me and how I wasn't calling him back, so I must be cheating him. \n\nI called him back, noted the weather, his own statements and business hours and he calmed down.  I noted that I'd contact him back with some scheduling options as quickly as I could. \n\nAnd I did. But he did not respond. So I did not schedule him and focused on the customers who... called me back and stuff. \n\nThen he came back around, yelling at me for \"forgetting about him\" and pointing out again how he'd already paid me.  I noted that he was unresponsive to my messages about scheduling and he blew that off, stating I could come \"at any time I was free\"\n\nI noted how I'm never \"free\" and my policy is to set a hard schedule. So we did.  But then a winter storm came that day, too, so I had to cancel it.  He said he understood.  I offered him more scheduling slots and he wanted to know why I didn't just come on by.  I had to re-iterate myself. \n\nThis went on for a few weeks. I'd call.  No answer.  I'd offer him scheduled time slots via voicemail and text that would go unanswered. Then he'd suddenly call one day to yell at me for not coming.  After all, he'd already paid me. I then tried to force a slot on him and he said it was no good, then ignored more attempts and so on. \n\nThen came the big cuss storm day.  I reiterated everything HE said and did and didn't do and offered him a refund. He refused it, saying he wanted the work done because there's nobody else out here who can do it.  So I call him back, offer time slots via voicemail and again, no response. \n\nThen comes another morning. This time, 16 voicemails at 6am calling me MFer and all that stuff.  So I drafted a kind response to send via text stating that I'd tried all of these things... documenting all the times I tried... all his refusals to follow policy... and added that his reactions no longer allow me to feel safe in his home and therefore, I'm refunding his money and blocking him.\n\nThat way, I had everything documented if he ever went BBB or legal or whatever.  Nothing ever came of it, though. \n\nDo NOT ever let yourself feel bad for putting your foot down.  Drawing a line.  Especially if we have the markets cornered like this... they need to treat our services as assets, not demands.",

You are leveraging your time for more client building. If you know you can take more clients on, you can teach someone for less to do the work. There is an adjustment period and you need to train them well.\n\nHope this brings some perspective!",

Had I scaled I'd be responsible for multiple people, growing the business to support them and myself, all the headaches of employees, payroll, insurance etc, my job which I enjoy would change to running a company instead of doing the work.  I don't think I would like it.  I already don't like all the paperwork and administrative stuff when it's just me and I only in the last few years started farming that stuff out (worth it, should have done that much sooner!). I probably missed out on some income, probably missed out on building something of enduring value that I could have sold when I'm ready to walk away, but I get to do what I want to do and what I'm good at for the most part.

You're not crazy for seeing the trap.\n\nFew thoughts from someone who's wrestled with this:\n\n**Option 3: Productized services.** Instead of hiring people to do \"whatever clients need,\" you standardize one specific deliverable with a fixed scope and price. Easier to train people, easier to maintain quality, easier to say no to scope creep. Not as sexy as building a product, but way faster to validate.\n\n**The personal brand path is underrated.** If clients hire *you* specifically, that's actually an asset - but only if you capture the upside. Raise rates aggressively. Be pickier about clients. You don't need volume if you're premium.\n\n**The \"asset on the side\" approach works, but it's a 3-5 year game.** Building something while freelancing full-time is brutal. Most people I know who did it successfully either reduced freelancing hours (and income) to make room, or burned out trying to do both at 100%.\n\nHonestly? If I were making 8-14k/month solo with 100% margins, I'd raise rates before I hired anyone. The clients who complain probably aren't your best ones anyway.",

This instantly drives your scarcity and perceived value up - additionally you can take forward orders as well to guarantee future work (makes it easier to hire team and plan workload). If the waitlist fills up, raise your rates immediately.\n\n1. Work out which of your existing clients you have the most impact for, that you love working with, and can afford pay you quickly.\n\n2. Take that list and  find commonalities in what you deliver for these clients. Dig deeper into the key *outcomes* you create for them and the problems you solve or help them avoid.\n2a. Look for commonalities in praise and thanks you receive from these clients as well (\"no one we've ever used before did this for us\" or \"no one ever did it that way before\")\n\n3. Quantify it - Work out what each of those outcomes are worth (ballpark is fine) and what the opportunity cost is of not fixing the problems you solve (eg bad website left unaddressed might have 25% lower conversion rate than industry standard)\n\n4. Create an outcome focused offer (tangible so you can point to an end result or recognisable interal state change) with the defined outputs the dream clients you identified in step 1 want\n\n5. Map all the steps, outputs and services you provide to create these outcomes (rough is fine) and then eliminate all unnecessary ones. There will be things you do and over deliver on that you care about which clients probably don't care about much (or as much). Especially look for timely extras that create diminishing returns on time invested.\n\n6. Cease all advertising for other services, particularly if they're hourly priced. You can do them, but don't advertise them. \n\n7. Focus on promoting these outcomes focused packaged offers, price them as value based and use language to sell the state change and outcomes instead of the inclusions. Don't itemise hours taken in the offer. Focus on value your work creates.\n\n8. Create case studies etc using the client comments from step 2a. And frame them as \"and that's why we do it this way\"\n\n9. See if you can sell the offer that excites you the most, if it works, do that on repeat and now you have a value based business and you're no longer priced as a commodity.\n9a. Repeat with each package if you've got multiple services\n\n10. Decide if you want to get more clients or just work with better ones. Decide if you want to hire a team.\n10a. Increase rates regularly if your wait-list keeps growing.\n\n11. If you chose to hire a team, you've got the processes built out and it's much easier to handover - you've also moved closer to a turnkey business which is sellable\n\nHope that helps :D",

      "selftext": "I’ve been running a handmade business for several years and I love the actual work.\nHowever, a small number of very difficult customers (aggressive messages, ignoring boundaries, constant pressure) has seriously affected my mental health over the yeats.\nI’m at a point where I’m questioning whether continuing is worth the emotional cost, even though the business itself works.\nHas anyone here closed or paused their business mainly because of customer behavior?\nHow did you know it was the right decision — or how did you protect yourself if you stayed?\n\nUpdate:\nI want to add more context because I realize “bad customers” can sound abstract.\nThis hasn’t been about a few rude messages or normal customer service stress. Over many years as a solo handmade business owner, I’ve dealt with a recurring pattern where a small number of customers escalated far beyond normal business interactions.\n\nI’ve experienced insults, verbal abuse, pressure, and threats. When I enforced boundaries or ended business relationships, some customers didn’t disengage — they escalated further. In some cases, they bypassed formal communication channels and used private contact details I never shared, including contacting me outside business hours and sending messages or letters to my private address. That crossed a line from “difficult customers” into something that felt unsafe and deeply distressing.\n\nThe cumulative impact of this has been severe: burnout, anxiety, panic reactions, and a loss of trust and joy in work I once loved. Being the sole person responsible — emotionally, legally, and operationally — meant there was no buffer, no team, no protection layer.\n\nI’m sharing this not to seek validation or business advice, but because talking about it helps me process what happened. Stepping back is not about weakness or giving up — it’s about protecting my mental health after years of repeated boundary violations.\nIf you’ve experienced something similar as a solo founder or creative business owner, you’re not alone. Sometimes the healthiest decision isn’t optimization — it’s distance.",

I had a short small mental break around 6 years ago from a particularly nasty review during the height of busy season. That combined with the customers messages just put me over the edge and I had to take a few days off to lower stress levels. \n\nI say all that to mention this: last year I silenced Etsy seller notifications on my phone. No more cha-ching. No more message notifications. \n\nI now only deal with Etsy when I'm logged in my computer and working (granted that's like 8-14 hours given the day, I'm still a sbo). It's made a huge difference in my mental health and being able to truly have a break from customers. \n\nYou can be grateful for success without being available 24/7 to shoppers.

So good that in 2025 I decided to start my own company and sell servers (always loved hardware) to other businesses that need them for their operations. And it worked out great, given the crazy shortage of capacity amid the growth of the LLM sector.   \n  \nBUT these taxes in Europe are *killing* me. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to start working for nothing just because I have to strictly follow corporate tax compliance, because I'm a decent person and I don't like prisons, haha. \n\nHeard that VAT can be partially refunded or not paid at all, and even looked for some local sales tax advisory services (I'm in Turkey), but so far it all looks too complicated and hopeless. I'm not even thinking about VAT exemption - it's too cool to be true. But hope dies last, so I want to ask you - has anyone dealt with this crap?   \n  \nAll this time, I've been sending servers all over Europe to minimize ping for my clients, and my wallet can no longer withstand these taxes.   \n  \nWould be VERY grateful for your help.",

In fact often times it’s cheaper to pay someone else to do things you shouldn’t be doing or aren’t good at. For example - doing their own books/taxes. Most people don’t even know what COGS means, of the ones that do few can tell the difference between a COGS and an expense.

They don’t understand and they care even less than what they do understand. Our close friends and family may care about us winning, but they don’t actually give a shit about what we do. They may be interested and some may even enjoy having conversations about it, but whether we win or lose they won’t be losing any sleep over us.

I put about $250,000 into the site to improve it.\n\nThis site was the first car wash in my city maybe 35 years ago, since then this site has failed 3-4 times that I know of. When I bought it, this wash was 1 of 3 and now I'm 1 of 9 with the 6 new washes being huge private equity run large brands with hundreds of locations.  Probably $5-8million dollar beautiful locations\n\nThe site never profited. At best it broke even. Now with all the new competition I'm losing about $7700 a month.\n\nPart of me is reluctant to close it down because I still have this hope that it could be successful to some degree.\n\nOther side of me is I'm tired of dealing with employees, customer issues, legal, and accounting work., Always the possibility of liability from a customer or even an employee.   I'm also at a point in my life where I'm able to retire.  My possibilities are 1. Attempt to sell the wash as a complete car wash 2. Sell off the assets and sell building.  3.  Lease the vacant building in land.\n\nAbout $100,000 of the equipment I could use at another location. I was considering listing the complete wash for 750,000 and see where it goes. After that I would probably lease just the building and land for maybe 3000 a month.\n\n  \nThank you for any time and advice you can share",

Alibaba is the go-to for most people I see online, but it feels overwhelming with all the trading companies mixed in with factories. 1688 (through agents) seems cheaper for direct-from-manufacturer but has a language barrier. Global Sources looks more premium/B2B-focused. I also came across Made-in-China, which appears geared toward verified factories with detailed supplier profiles and some emphasis on quality checks—though I know sites can hype themselves up.\n\n\nI'm not married to any one platform; I just want to do this right the first time and not waste money on bad orders. Fellow small business owners who've successfully imported from China:\n\nWhat platforms or sites have actually worked best for you in practice (pros, cons, or why you switched)?\nHave you had good/bad experiences with Made-in-China.com specifically, or is it similar to the others?\nWhat are your biggest red flags when evaluating suppliers (e.g., fake reviews, MOQ issues, communication)?\nPractical tips for newbies: Do you always order samples first? Use sourcing agents? Preferred payment methods (PayPal vs. bank transfer vs. Trade Assurance)? How are you handling current tariffs/customs without getting hit too hard?\nAny must-do steps or resources (books, YouTube channels, forums) that helped you get started without major headaches?\n\nReally value any firsthand stories what went wrong, what you'd do differently, or what surprised you positively. Thanks so much in advance for sharing your wisdom, it's helping a ton as I figure this out!",

I know it's something I should be doing better, but between newsletters, automations, deliverability, and a million different tools, I'm not sure what actually matters at this stage.\n\nI'm curious what's worked for other small business owners in practice. Did you start simple or jump straight into automations like welcome emails and promos? How often do you email your list without feeling like you're annoying people? And when it comes to tools, are there any platforms you genuinely liked using (or ones you wish you'd avoided)\n\nI'd love to hear what you'd do differently if you were starting over, especially any lessons learned the hard way.
