I'm doing all the heavy lifting. She just puts the bottles in the bag. \n\nI came to find out that the recycling centre has bins they can drop on site and they also offer to empty them once a week. Booked the bins, booked the pick ups and now I'm set to collect basically free money. \n\nThe owners didn't seem bothered to know what I was doing and agreed to give me the next year's worth of recycling if I took care of things. \n\nI'm tempted to just call restaurants and hit them up for this scheme. \n\n\nHas anyone done this? It's nuts the owners of the restaurant are so lazy.",

          "body": "With £10k and that kind of monthly savings rate, you've actually got some solid options to explore. Have you looked into service-based franchises at all? Things like cleaning services, pet care, or mobile car detailing can work really well in the UK market.. lower overhead than retail and you can often start small and scale up.\n\nThe property thing - yeah i get why you're hesitant there. But service businesses are different because you're not tied to expensive real estate. One thing I'd suggest is looking at businesses where you can test the concept first before going all in. Like if you're thinking about a cleaning franchise, maybe try running a small independent version for a few months to see if you even like managing crews and dealing with customers. That way your £10k goes toward actually validating the idea instead of just jumping in blind.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been trying to make money online for a while now, and honestly I’ve tested like 10 different things. Most of them either paid basically nothing or took forever to see any results. I kept jumping from idea to idea because everyone online makes it look so easy, but when you actually try it, it’s a whole different story. Being a student doesn’t help either, I barely have time and I’m always broke, so I needed something that actually works without a bunch of start-up costs.\nAfter trying all that stuff, only a few things ended up giving me real payouts. Making short little brand videos on Methods app has been surprisingly decent, I’m not some influencer or anything, but the beginner tasks still pay something. I also started putting simple digital templates on Etsy, and I sell small guides and checklists on Gumroad whenever I have time to make new ones. And when I need quick tiny cash, KashKick fills in the gaps, even if it’s not a lot. These aren’t huge money makers, but when you stack them together, it’s actually helped me get through the last couple months.\nI’m still learning and trying things though, because I kinda need every extra dollar I can get right now. If anyone else is also doing low-effort or beginner-friendly online stuff that pays even a little, I’d love to hear what’s been working for you. I’m really just trying to survive school without going completely broke lol.",

      "selftext": "If you’re looking for a high-leverage side hustle in 2025, I genuinely think building a micro SaaS is the move. You don’t need VC money, a team, or years of coding experience anymore.\n\nHere’s the formula:\n\nFind a problem you’ve personally experienced, something annoying that costs you time or energy, and build a solution around that inside of Lovable. It’ll handle all the SaaS boilerplate for you, so you can focus on the actual product. Use Supabase for your backend and Stripe for payments. That’s your foundation sorted.\n\nNow when it comes to marketing, this is where most people go wrong. The first 30 days should be 100% organic. That looks like:\n\n1. Reddit posts that don’t feel like plugs. Ask questions or share your story in communities related to your niche. Don’t sell, just spark discussion.\n\n2. Reddit replies under competitor mentions. Add real value to existing threads; people will click through naturally.\n\n3. YouTube comment placements. Leave thoughtful comments under videos where your target users hang out.\n\n4. Short-form videos. Post simple slideshows or product demos daily on TikTok, Reels, and Shorts, like “top 5 controversial things I learnt about XYZ” \n\n5. AI UGC videos. Use an avatar or voiceover to share your product demo with a catchy hook like “Can’t believe this tool does X.”\n\n6. Green screen memes. “POV: you realised [pain your product solves]” it’s quick, relatable, viral.\n\n7. Standing avatar + wall of text. Static background, emotional or relatable text overlay; crazy watch time, easy to make.\n\nThese plays can bring your first 100 users without spending a cent on ads. Stack them daily, and you’ll start building real momentum fast.\n\nBtw you can run these marketing strategies inside something like Canva or Aftermark AI ",

Ive never done it, but I have a buddy who lives near Chicago and he will go to chicago on the weekend, do door dash and make about 3 days worth of normal pay in two days AND he doesnt have to worry about gas cause he uses a bike to ride around orders.

I’ve been trying to take a 50% deposit upfront, but not everyone is willing to. It’s hard to keep track, especially with some clients taking weeks to pay. Last month I completely forgot to invoice a customer, just totally spaced on it until they texted me asking for their invoice.\n\nAlso getting leads from nextdoor and facebook but half of them ghost after I send estimates. Takes me a day or two to respond usually because I'm at my day job. Had someone ask for a quote on replacing their deck boards last week, sent it that evening, they went with someone else the next morning.\n\nMy system right now is basically google sheets and hoping I remember everything, it's clearly not working anymore as I'm getting busier.\n\nWhat are you guys using to stay organized with this stuff?",

      "selftext": "Hey all, I'm needing some help with brainstorming ideas for extra income, ideally relatively quickly. I currently have a full time 40 hour a week job. It's normally Monday-Friday, 9-5, but some days I may have to work late, take evening calls, or take calls during the day on weekends. Because of that, I need a fairly flexible side hustle. My full time job absolutely comes first, every time. The good news is that I often have free time during my work day where I can't leave the building, but can work on personal projects as long as I have my regular work done. \n\nWhile I can pay all my bills with my current job, there's not much left over for me. I'm barely managing to have enough to get my medications, and I'm currently in physical therapy that I'm not sure how I'm going to pay for. That also means there's not really money for Christmas, or buying myself new clothes when I need them for work, vehicle repairs, helping my spouse with the grocery bill, etc. I also really want to work on paying off my credit card debts from when I was going through an exceptionally hard time.\n\nI tried Biolife and they could only get a good vein in one arm so they put me on deferral. I get one more try to see if they can stick me but after that it's a permanent deferral to my understanding. My right arm has a great vein, my left arm doesn't.\n\nMy car insurance will go up 100$ a month to cover me if I do something like Doordash, Instacart, or UberEats. I'm concerned that I won't be able to make enough to make it worth it after the insurance and gas. But I've also never done any freelance food delivery before, so maybe I'm selling short how much I'll make from that. If you could share your experience from that, it might help reassure me. I'm lucky that I'm in a major metro area, so I don't think I'd be short on work necessarily.\n\nI'm getting a seasonal job that I can work once a week at a place I've worked before. It's a little retail shop and fairly low-stress other than how much I have to be on my feet. Unfortunately, that'll only add another 100$ a week, give or take depending on exactly how much they schedule me. \n\nI'm working on opening an Etsy shop. I'm fairly creative and crafty and originally went to school for graphic design. I'm planning to do some reselling of antiques, keepsakes, limited edition items, and Youtuber merch that my spouse no longer wants. I'm also planning on selling door hangers (think \"do not open\"), pin back buttons, coasters, and kandi bracelets. My spouse will also be working with me to offer tarot readings and spell jars among other witchy things, as they have a lot of experience in those things. \n\nWould doing food delivery be worth it? Are there any other options that I'm not seeing? I know there are technically game/survey apps that pay that I could do at work when I'm not busy, but they pay so little or take so long to get paid that I'm not sure it would be worth my time.",

      "selftext": "Truth be told, building anything passive was never the grand plan. I just got so incredibly tired of having to start from absolute zero, every single time I tried something new.\n\nIt all began with this super simple habit. Whenever I made something that actually sold, I'd literally just remake it three different ways - new colors, different titles, tiny tweaks. I wasn't trying to be clever or strategic, I just, honestly, didn't want my shop to look completely empty. Then, a few weeks later, it hit me: those duplicate listings were ranking all on their own, quietly pulling in random sales while I was off doing, well, anything else.\n\nThe same phenomenon extended to Pinterest. I'd published a few pins, then promptly disregarded them, only to find them consistently driving traffic. Medium echoed this experience, an article composed long ago continued to accrue views. It became apparent: any content or asset that formed a connection to another element within my ecosystem maintained its efficacy without active management.\n\nRecognizing this, I intentionally cultivated these connections. Currently, my Etsy listings direct to my blog, which in turn links back to the shop, with Pinterest serving as a feeder for both. This isn't sophisticated, but it creates a continuous loop. Consequently, the system remains operational even during periods of disengagement.\n\nThis isn't the result of complex automation. Instead, it operates on a principle akin to 'digital gravity', initial momentum in one area organically attracts and propels related components, sustaining a continuous flow.\n\nMy former belief was that sustaining my hustle required perpetual motivation. The reality proved to be simpler: I merely needed to establish systems robust enough to function independently of my energy levels. Now, I frequently awaken to small sales, monitor traffic, and feel a sense of contentment knowing the underlying mechanics continue to operate discreetly.\n\n",

Real users, real results, and real momentum!\n\nIf you want to try it out, search MyFutureSelf on iOS -- and I won’t gatekeep the community… hit “X” on the paywall and you’ll get an 80% discount. 🙌\n\n\n\nEdit: Surreal having multiple people in the comments saying they’re users.

      "selftext": "A couple of years ago, I kind of stumbled into something I didn’t plan at all. I just wanted a small side project to do outside of work, and nothing serious, just a creative outlet. Instagram was honestly the last place I thought I’d make money.\n\n\n\nIt started super random. I had this tiny hobby account where I posted aesthetic desk setups and productivity stuff I found online. One post blew up out of nowhere, and followers started rolling in. Then someone DMed me asking if I could post their product on my story and offered $20. That was my “wait… people actually pay for this??” moment.\n\n\n\nI got curious and made a few more accounts in different niches, like quotes, lifestyle, cozy home decor, that kind of stuff. Nothing huge, but I started noticing patterns: which content got engagement, what time posts hit best, and what types of followers brands were after.\n\n\n\nEventually, I teamed up with two friends to handle more pages. I thought it'd make things easier, but managing 20+ accounts quickly turned into chaos: constant logins/logouts, getting flagged as bots, and even losing accounts because Instagram thought we were sketchy. On top of that, I started worrying about losing control over these accounts, since we were sharing passwords, any single leak could put all my accounts and earnings at risk. So I needed a way to keep full control over my own accounts without compromising teamwork.\n\n\n\nThat's when I got smarter about the setup. My friends and I used Canva for posts (none of us were Photoshop pros), Later for scheduling, CapCut and InShot for Reels, and AdsPower to keep everything separated. It helped a lot with security, no more device confusion or accidental cross-logins, and the teamwork feature let me assign roles and permissions without having to share logins directly.\n\n\n\nI wouldn’t call it “passive” in the beginning cuz it was a grind. But once things were set up, a lot started running on autopilot. Some of our old pages still bring in cash from story promos, affiliate links, or the occasional account sale to someone who wants a head start.\n\n\n\nHere’s what I’ve learned:\n\n• “Soft” niches (quotes, lifestyle, cute pets, productivity) are way easier to grow and monetize than most people think.\n\n• Consistency &gt; creativity when you’re starting out.\n\n• And seriously, once you scale, security and organization are everything.\n\n\n\nIt’s not a get-rich-quick thing, but it’s been a solid little side income for something that started as me just posting random aesthetic pics in my free time.",

Almost every business today needs video content for marketing, whether it is Instagram reels, TikTok shorts, YouTube videos, or website promos. The demand is huge and growing.\n\nYou don’t need to be a filmmaker. You can learn basic editing in a week. The only part most beginners struggle with is doing voiceovers, but that problem is basically solved now because you can use AI voiceover tools and get clean, natural narration without recording anything yourself.\n\nOnce you know how to put together short promotional videos, product demos, before-and-after videos, or service explainers, you can sell monthly content bundles to small businesses. For example:\n\n10 short videos per month  \n2 long videos per month  \nA full video reel pack  \nSocial media formatted clips\n\nBusinesses love it because they need fresh content constantly, and you can deliver it quickly once you have a workflow. This skill is simple, fast to learn, and can become steady income because businesses often stay with you month after month.\n\nI also explain how to make voiceovers easily in my newsletter, link in my bio if you want more details.",

          "body": "I've been making a couple hundred each month just by looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than the cost. It's called bonus arbitrage. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

Alongside my full-time job, I have always traded in domain names. I have successfully sold many domains, such as hond.nl, fietsenwinkel.nl and many more. For over twenty years, I’ve earned an extra monthly income this way. Sometimes I made €3,000, but usually between €1,000 and €1,500 per month by buying and selling domain names.\n\nHowever, the past year has been very disappointing because there are very few good names left with extensions like .com, .eu and .nl. I was actually thinking about quitting… until I had a conversation with a colleague who emigrated to Dubai. He told me that the .ae extension is becoming increasingly popular among locals and  many international companies due to tourism growth.\n\nEspecially in the real estate sector, .ae domains are used more and more to build trust when selling expensive villas. You can easily buy .com or .nl domains anywhere, which has led to a lot of scammers. A .ae domain, on the other hand, is harder to obtain and requires passport verification before the government approves the registration (you don´t need to have a pasport-ID from the emirates, you just need to have an ID and that´s it.. I live in the Netherlands and that´s also fine.\n\nSo I decided to give it a try. In the first weeks I invested €360, because through hosts like OnlyDomains you pay around €36 per year for a .ae domain. I immediately bought the domains palmjumeirahvillas.ae and palmjumeirahhotels.ae. Within a week I sold them simply by emailing real estate companies with an offer.\n\nIn the first month I earned €9,800, and the month after that €15,600. It continued like that for a while. Recently, I’ve noticed that competition is increasing and profits are slightly lower, so I started flipping: I bought domains I had previously owned again and resold them within a week with a 60% margin. In the end, I’ve now made €100,000 and I’m enjoying my time alongside my job even more.\n\nI hope young, driven entrepreneurs read this and find some motivation. There are so many opportunities as long as you think of a good idea and apply it to a niche that is rapidly growing. Follow the market! We can clearly see that the housing market in Dubai is extremely popular, so we respond to that.\n\nI wish you all a wonderful evening and lots of success.",

It adds zero value to anyone except the person trying to cash in. In most businesses you’re paying for a product or a service that provides some benefit — but with domain flipping there’s no added value, just unnecessary friction and the annoyance of having to brainstorm alternate names.\n\nGlad it works that well for you, though in general don’t have respect for this kind of business.",

Some of my best passive income successes in the past have been from dipping my spoon into the broader market, but I’d be hesitant to lean into it right now given the number of states that are enacting ID laws for accessing porn sites, which might as well be a porn ban. Likewise, at this point, there’s very little to stop the Project 2025 vision of making porn illegal within the next year a reality, and I would not be at all surprised if any businesses considered to be abetting the distribution of pornography to be held liable as well.\n \nSo, ignoring any moral objections you may have, strictly in terms of what’s going to be best for your business over the next three years or more, I don’t think leaning into it is the way. Maybe ten years ago but not in this budding dystopia we’re rolling into. If it were me, I’d monitor them to make sure they aren’t promoting or fronting for some truly rancid stuff, but leaning towards cutting quick if their presence is providing little relative benefit or limiting growth. Meanwhile I’d be reviewing and updating terms and user agreements to course correct.",

Amazon warehouse employees are at least paid but treated horrendously and not allowed to take bathroom breaks. Most restaurants use undocumented labor for their kitchen staff, which is not bad in my opinion, but as a result they often pay less than minimum wage which is morally wrong. Unfortunately, I could go on forever. In fact, I don’t know if I can name an industry that is 100% morally sound. \n\nA lot of modern porn is actually not too bad in terms of ethics. Obviously there are certainly porn sites that are not morally sound at all and some that violate legality. But a lot of popular modern porn sites are not only ethical, but empowering for the content creators! I feel like porn faced heavy scrutiny in the 2010’s after the documentary ‘Hot Girls Wanted’ exposed how awful it was, and as a result it has been reformed for the better.  Only Fans and Fansly for example, allows their creators freedom/control over their content, work conditions, and a very equitable share of the generated profits! The top 10% of creators on those sites likely make 6 figures, have full creative control over what type of content they make, and are protected from workplace harassment. It also can be a safe space, and excellent platform for lgbtqia people to not only express their sexuality, but monetize if. \n\nAgain, I’m sure there are definitely porn sites that are unethical, but I would go out on a limb and say that currently, porn is the most ethical that it has ever been, and is far from the worst industry. I would feel much worse about being involved in the real estate broker/foreclosure, predatory/payday loan, or healthcare industries than porn.",

      "selftext": "Forget building elaborate automated systems. My actual goal was far simpler: I just wanted to stop micro-managing every single one of my side hustles.\n\nMy first foray into automation began with a basic reminder. I simply scheduled a weekly alert for Fridays to relist a handful of Etsy products that were losing visibility. This minimal effort, taking barely two minutes, proved surprisingly effective at preventing a significant drop in traffic.\n\nNext, I integrated auto-scheduling for Pinterest. I simply took my existing designs, configured them to loop every few weeks, and pushed them out. There was no specific optimization. Yet, these automatically recycled posts began generating a consistent flow of clicks.\n\nMy next step involved a more technical approach: I developed a simple script to programmatically reindex older blog pages via Google’s API. While it sounds complex, its primary purpose was to automate a task I disliked performing manually. Once confirmed operational, I promptly ceased thinking about it.\n\nThis pattern became a clear directive, every instance of successful automation stemmed from a reluctance to perform repetitive, unstimulating tasks manually.\n\nSo now, the Etsy listings just auto-renew, the pins repost themselves, the old pages get reindexed... and this little ecosystem just keeps generating a handful of random sales or clicks each week. It's never anything massive, but it totally adds up, enough for coffee, a nice little rent buffer, and honestly, a whole lot of peace of mind.\n\nEveryone out there talks about 'passive income' like it's this glorious, sprawling system you build once and then, boom, you retire to a beach. For me? It's way more like a messy pile of half-automated chores that just quietly chug along in the background while I'm off doing literally anything else.\n\nIt's undoubtedly chaotic, lacking any aesthetic appeal, and occasionally requires troubleshooting. Yet, its consistent contribution to my rent makes it entirely satisfactory.\n\n",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’ve been doing KDP since August of 2024, a little over a year now. I started with nothing. Literally. No money, living out of my car. I want to share my full experience scaling this from $0 to $150K revenue. The lessons I learned, and why I think KDP is nowhere near saturated as many claim.\n\nMy hope is that this post will give you value, motivation, and perspective, especially if you’re just starting out or feel stuck.\n\n# A Little Background\n\nI’ve always been into business, ever since i was a kid flipping Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh cards and other collectibles, plus video game currencies, items, accounts. Over the years I’ve tried everything: forex, stock trading, affiliate marketing, SEO blogs, crypto, dropshipping, customer acquisition/lead generation agency, CPA marketing, SMMA, POD, and of course KDP.\n\nJust to keep in mind, this is not my first time doing KDP. My first attempt was in 2019, but my account got banned in early 2020 for a few (frustrating) reasons:\n\n* I used a term, that a few months later got filled for trademark and Amazon flagged me, even tho the trademark was just pending and was rejected later.\n* Got hit with a “similar cover” strike ( I should have fought it, probably would have won. Not sure why I didn’t.)\n* Published a book called “Snarky Nurse Coloring Book” with the idea that the book was snarky (snarky quotes), not the nurse. Tt got reported by a brand called Snarky Nurse or something similar.\n\nAfter the third strike, Amazon didn’t let me appeal or explain myself, they kept sending the same generic response that the decision is final and nothing could be done.\n\nAfter all this I didn’t do anything, I got comfortable, had plenty in savings, some other life events happened during covid that I lost any motivation to do anything, until life forced me to start again.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nI’m not smart or special. Many people make much more with KDP than I do. But I’ve failed a lot and learned from my mistakes, and treated this like a real business. What I’ll share is what worked for me. Hopefully you’ll learn something useful from it and get some clarity on how you should approach this business.\n\n# Quick Stats:\n\n* Started: August 2024.\n* Books Published 148. (1 book every 3 days or so)\n* Total Revenue: \\~$150,000\n* Ad Spend: \\~$16,000\n* Employee Costs: \\~$24,000\n* Tools &amp; Subscriptions: \\~$2,500\n* TikTok Marketing Videos: \\~2,000\n* Profit (before tax): \\~100,000\n\nLast month, I made \\~$32,000 revenue, with \\~$10,000 expenses.\n\n# Lessons, Tests &amp; Observations:\n\n1. **Quality vs. Quantity.** I’ve seen many YouTubers talk about focusing only on quality and to be honest I don’t fully agree. I started with quantity, not because I believed in mass publishing, but because I wanted data. I uploaded many somewhat decent quality books at first (most didn’t even hit 10 sales) and they helped me to identify which niches and formats had potential. Then I moved to more medium quality books, they took me 2-5 days each, in niches that showed potential and these confirmed the winners. I then outsourced even better versions and that’s where most of my revenue came from (excluding the unicorn). So it’s not quality or quantity, you need both to optimize your business.\n2. **Amazon ads.** I’m a numbers guy, I love data, tracking, testing everything. With amazon ads you obviously get more sales, but you also get an 20-30% bump in the organic sales. Sales boost your BSR, help you rank higher, which gets you more sales, more reviews, and all of this combined, a stronger foundation in the algorithm, making it more difficult for competitors to outrank you. So yes, ads are worth it, even beyond direct ROI. There’s another reason why I find ads even more important than getting sales. To be honest I didn’t even start them with the idea to make money from them directly. As I said, I love data, and amazon unfortunately shows you almost no valuable data at all. Running ads helps you a little bit as you can see the impressions you get, how many clicks you get and how many conversions, enough signal to see what’s working and what isn’t. It’s not ideal, but this is what we have to deal with when it comes to amazon.\n3. **Keywords.** Always use relevant keywords, leave fields if you don’t have anything relevant to add. I tested adding trending but not relevant keywords on a couple of books that had \\~20 sales a month each. Sales dropped to 4 and 6 the first month and 1 and 0 on the second month. Removing those irrelevant keywords didn’t restore the sales. Only running ads brought them back. Unrelated words hurt your relevance score, which can tank your book entirely\n4. **External ads.** I had some experimentation with meta ads, spend $600 and made \\~$450 above baseline over the next few months (sales doubled the month with the ads being run and slowly fell back to baseline). Still not enough data to fully judge, I’ll test this more, I need to spend at least $10,000 to have at least some opinion about this, and that’s what I’m going to do in the upcoming months.\n5. **A+ Content.** Almost always helps unless it’s really, really bad. I’ve tested many different layouts, worst ones had \\~10% increase in CVR, the best ones increased 80-150%, depending on the niche and design. Either way, it helps.\n6. **Cover Design (not just artsy, its psychology).** After niche selection, cover is the most important factor. People do judge a book by it’s cover If your design isn’t at least as good as top competitors in that niche, your book is gonna sink in the vast ocean that is Amazon. If you can afford it and your design skills aren’t great, I would suggest outsourcing covers to skilled designers. Still, do some of them yourself, to have a better understanding as not all of it is art, it’s more about the psychology of the customer, it is the pitch for your product. (Also the content of the book has to be good enough as well, because negative reviews can kill your book just as easily as bad cover, just a little slower).\n7. **Descriptions.** I’m not sure if I am just bad at writing them, but I never seen a big difference in CVR from it. The only thing that seems to matter in my experience is the formatting. The description still has to be informative and relevant to the book itself, but if it’s done in a big block of text it’s not gonna help. If it is formatted nicely, then I’ve seen 10-30% CVR improvements. The other thing that I’ve noticed is that having a relevant and informative description helps the book rank higher. It happened consistently enough to make me almost sure that Amazon’s algorithm rewards it.\n8. **Low Search Volume Niches (Small Margins Scale Big).** Pretty much every YouTube video I watched about KDP said to target niches that have high search volume of 1000+ at the minimum and ignore every one of them that get less. I often target niches other skip, even less than 500 searches per month. I care more about competitor strength and actual sales. If I feel I have a fighting chance against the competitor in that kind of niche, that has 100-200k BSR, then I’ll attack it. I get it, making books that are going to get 100-200 sales a month isn’t sexy, but over the year they make $1,200-$2,400, and ten, twenty, thirty, one hundred of these adds up to real income.\n9. **E-mail Lists.** These are great but I’ve only managed to make them work in two situations. In my unicorn niche, I built a list of 1,000+ via a variety of freebies. When I launched a supporting book with a release day discount, I emailed the list and got 200+ day one sales. I’m not saying that 20% of the email list converted, but even if 3-4% can create enough sales velocity to push the book up the rankings making it get even more sales and climb even higher up. Second, with my “client” brand (consumable books). We built the list by running promotional ads and in book freebies. After every weekly release, the email goes out and almost consistently gets 100 day one sales, some releases even get 200-300.\n10. **Short-Form Video Marketing.** One day I got bored and thought about trying out something new, I released a book in a very competitive niche(which means lot’s of interested people) and created a TikTok account to make videos for that book. After printing the book and recording a few videos, repurposing them, following trends, changing the hooks , etc., one video hit nearly 1m views. This led to over 2,000 sales in the first week after upload. Since then I’ve uploaded 250+ videos, hired other people to make videos for me and I’ve had a few other viral videos (not as bit as the original one tho).\n11. **Pricing.** Compete on the quality of your book rather than price, if your book is better than competitor’s, price it higher and position it as premium. Low price makes you look cheap, not “affordable”. The pricing is different depending on the niche and type of the book itself, so what I would recommend is to launch around the average competitor price, could be a little higher if you are confident in your book (that’s what I do), or price it just a little below the average. Monitor CVR, if it is solid, then increase the price by $1 and observe, if it gets too big of a hit, reverse the change if it doesn’t keep increasing the price. If the book ranks high, gets steady organic sales and reviews, push premium pricing.\n12. **99% of Gamblers Give Up Before They Hit it Big.** Okay, maybe not in gambling (please don’t). But in business? Mostly true. Most people give up right before they’ve learned enough both from theirs, and other people’s failures to make their business work. There’s plenty of money in almost every business. Imagine a gambler spinning the slots, after 30 failed spins, he hits jackpot. Business it’s similar, keep testing, keep learning, fail, tweak it, try again. Do that 30 times and on attempt 31 it suddenly looks like you “got lucky”(You didn’t. You just didn’t quit.) If you knew that you were 30 failures away from your dream, would you keep going?\n13. AI Tools as Assistants, Not Crutches Do not let AI do all the work for you. You won’t really learn what’s working and the quality will be subpar. People notice that the book was written by AI and leave negative reviews. Use it to brainstorm ideas, rough outlines, keyword ideas that you’re gonna validate, even sketch A+ layouts. Always double check the accuracy (AI likes to hallucinate) and IP. AI speeds you up, significantly, but it doesn’t do the job for you.\n14. **KDP plateau.** Plateaus do happen at every stage. I sat at a bit over $6,000 per month for a while, luckily for me it was a decent enough revenue to stay motivated. Some people, especially beginners, plateau at $0 per month, or they reach $500 in the first months, stall for a few months, assume “KDP is dead” and quit. It’s not. It’s just lag and learning. The move isn’t to quit, it’s to keep publishing and keep making small improvements. Eventually you’ll break out. Keep going, keep measuring, keep improving and then the compounding finally shows up.\n15. **Outsourcing and delegating.** All of this is going to depend on your budget and skill level. I hire people to go faster, not to disappear. I keep strategy, ads, research, final approval and hand off stuff like covers, interiors, basic edits, videos. I also do some books fully myself to keep improving and learning. At first you should do everything yourself, to learn as much as possible, to even know what to ask your employees to do, to be able to make SOPs for them. Eventually when you can no longer keep up with the amount of books you want to make, you start hiring. Track cost per title, have an idea on how fast the contractors work, how long it is going to take to make a book. Keep light PM Cadence, do weekly check-ins, have a QC checklist before anything goes live. Plan so that one person’s vacation doesn’t stall launches. Pay on time, give bonuses when earned, give specific feedback, promote your A-players.\n16. **Treat it like a real business and I mean REAL business.** KDP isn’t a lottery ticket, it’s a real publishing business. I budget, track unit economics and make decisions off numbers, not vibes. That means knowing your CTR/CVR, ACOS/TACOS, margin, payback time (how long till the book repays it’s investment), opportunity cost, LTV per title and more. Keep a simple P&amp;L, reinvest into ads, books, testing, learning. Write SOPs for contractors, kill or fix anything that doesn’t earn its shelf space. Manage your cashflow, plan for seasonality, keep runway for tests, don’t starve the winners. Be boringly safe on ToS/IP and make sure to set aside money for taxes. Real business = clear goals, clean and tight processes, consistent iteration.\n17. **You need action much more than you need information.** Most people don’t have a knowledge problem, they have a doing problem. You can binge every KDP video, read every post in KDP forums and still have $0 in royalties because you never uploaded anything. On top of that you’re gonna forget most of the stuff you watched either way if you do not try to implement it almost immediately. When and if you’ll start taking action, you’ll go back and start rewatching those videos again with context. Learn just enough to take action. By taking action you’ll learn the most. Half baked action beats perfect research because market teaches faster than any tutorial. Most importantly be consistent with your action, and consistently improve with it.\n\n# Key Takeaways\n\nKDP is not oversaturated. People said that it was already “too late” back in 2019 when I first started, and they’ll say the same in 2030. The real difference is how you treat KDP. Treat it like a real business. Track data. Build Systems. Reinvest Profits. TEST RELENTLESSLY. Be consistent and improve every week. Stagnation is death, and even to maintain you level, you have to keep evolving because the competition is. Plan your week. Every Sunday, I write down my tasks and deadlines. And I need to do them. No excuses. That habit alone kept me on track for 60-70 hours a week for over a year.\n\n# My Goals for the Future\n\nThis December my plan is to get to $100,000 - the coveted six figure month. I know it’s possible, because December sales can triple or quadruple.  \nBut my goals don’t stop here.\n\n**My next milestone for 2026:**  \n$1,000,000 in total revenue  \n$253k+ in December 2026 alone.  \nThe reason for that specific figure is that back in 2020 I spoke with someone who made $252K in December 2019 with a team consisting of her and her husband. I’m going to have a bigger team than that to try to hit this number, but let’s ignore that fact.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis year has been life-changing. I went from being broke and sleeping in my car to running a six figure publishing business. I don’t think that this was luck. It was consistency, constant improvement, and treating KDP like the serious business it is. If you’re reading this and were thinking about quitting. DON’T. Keep going, test things, learn from your data, stay disciplined. Do not think “What if it’s not going work out? What if I fail?”. Think “What if everything does work out?”.",

I have many questions for you, hope you'll take a bit if your precious time to answer my questions.\n\n1) For this one, it's not really for you but for those commenters that saying you're using AI or you gave vague answers. I need to push it at no 1 because I don't think those people will have energy to read my essay till the end. Well, if they read, so here :\n\nIt's funny and sad how you saw this long ass explanations that you can't fathom what they're talking about, but still want to leave something so that the OP can experience a tenth of your miserable life by commenting that they're using AI or focusing on their vague answer eventhough actually their answer is make sense eventhough not straighforward, if you can read comprehensively.\n\n2) Now back to the topic. Most of your points eg: using ads and outsorcing the books, I'd assume you start to use those when you hit with good enough revenue. May I know how you started getting your first sale? Did you list the books and then wish for the best or you use ads from the start? Is it possible to just list out our product and just wait until some people interested to buy it? Or we still need to do some promotion? How about initial review, did you applly that for your book or you let review grew organically?\n\n3) You have more than 100 books, may I know if all of those from the same niche or different ones? If different, do you separate to different pen names that suitable for those niches or combine it under the same pen name?\n\n4) What software /system / service that you use for creating the low and medium content, and also high content. Eg: for high content youd need software or something to rearrange the format to make as book is it?\n\n5) As for the pricing, how would you decide the price? Based on content, word counts or pages? Eg for price 14.99, is it must be within 100 pages (for low content) and like 30k words (for high content)? What's your standard in pricing?\n\n6) Do you focusing on physical books or also ebook /audiobook? If including ebook and audiobook, do you have plan to create your own website to sell those? I mean, you'd increase the margin or something right?\n\n7) Are all your books use ISBN from Amazon or you bought your own? Would you keep using amazon kdp for it's trafic and book logistic convenience or you might venture out for proper publication?\n\n8) What's your opinion on untapped niches? Do you think it's untapped for a reason aka low or no demand, or it's still undiscovered because it's combination of different niches so it's a hard for people who's copying what niche works to create their own opportunity?\n\nI really appreciate it if you could answer all my curiosities. I'm interested to start amazon KDP with too much ideas but too little time and courage kinda hold me back. But reading your post make me think that it's not impossible for me to just start. Thank you for your time.\n\nP/s : sorry if there's any grammar mistake or whatever some people gonna be picky about, English is not my first language.",

          "body": "You can try bonus arbitrage, which can probably make you a couple hundred each month. Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

For the first month I targeted 20% of my deposit per day. If I profited anything more, then that’s a bonus at the end of the month. As the months went on I targeted a smaller percentage per day. \n\nI initially deposited $10 and at the end of the 12 months my account was standing on $924,66. This was just strictly based off what my targets were. There were a few days where I hit a stop loss but, keeping a simple risk strategy is going to be a key to success. \n\n\nWhere people end up messing up, is that they try to 5x their deposits within a day. Which doesn’t work. \n\nRather slow and steady, than try and rush to make a million overnight. ",

          "body": "I have been using the Vibecode app for a bit, so here is a straight answer.\nVibecode is more than a UI mockup tool. It generates actual mobile apps using React Native and Expo under the hood, and you can run them on your phone, not just click through static screens.\nI built a small mobile MVP with it that had email based login, saved user data, simple logic like tracking streaks and progress, and a couple of external API calls with basic tracking. That was enough to share the app with real users and collect feedback. All of that was done inside Vibecode without opening a traditional code editor.\nFrom what I have seen, it does well when your app is fairly straightforward. Things like auth, basic CRUD, simple conditions, and a few APIs are very doable. When you start asking for more unusual or complex workflows, it takes more effort to get what you want, and it helps a lot if you already understand how apps and data flows work.\nSo to answer the original question in practical terms:\nYes, Vibecode can build a real, functional mobile app, not just a visual prototype. It is a solid option if you want to get an MVP on a phone quickly and see how users react. If the app grows and you need heavy custom logic or long term maintainability, you will probably end up refining the generated code or bringing in a more traditional setup later, but that is a next step, not a blocker for getting started.",

Launches fast. The only issue I have is that edge cases and hyper custom logic sometimes needs tweaking after the app generates it, but that's honestly expected... You're not locked into what it outputs though as you can export and edit if needed.\n\nFor an MVP? Really freakin' solid. You'll have something real in days. The question is whether you want to spend time customizing stuff after or if the initial build is 80% of what you need anyway. You can then use vibe coders like Claude or Gemini Pro (hell, even GPT5 is decent) to finish the rest. \n\nBiggest thing I'd say is, try it for your specific use case first. Some app ideas are perfect for AI builders, others need custom development. But you'll know pretty quick once you start building.\n\nHope that helps.",

Dollar-cost averaging beats market timing - You invest the same amount regularly, regardless of market conditions. When prices are high, you buy fewer shares. When prices are low, you buy more. Over time, this averages out your purchase price and removes emotional decision-making.  \n  \n2. Low-cost index funds beat active management - Over 90% of active fund managers underperform the market over 15+ years (check the SPIVA scorecards yourself). Index funds track the entire market with fees around 0.1-0.3% annually instead of 1-2%+ for active funds. That difference compounds massively.  \n  \n3. Time in market beats timing the market - Historical data shows staying invested through crashes outperforms trying to predict them. The market has always recovered. Always.",

Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

If their client pays $1000 to them, they may keep $100 and split the remaining $900 amongst all the people in the campaign. So if you and I are the solo campaigners, and we each have equal views, we would see around $450 each. But if I have 90% of the views, I might get $800 and you get $100.

I will admit it does take a creative niche + consistent activity + adaptation and some luck. My first account took 3 months to get to 10K, the second account I did a different strategy and hit the number in 8 days. I made 1500 last month, 2300 the month prior, and 2700 the month prior to that. (I just realized I have spent a lot of that now that I am typing again so I need to save my money lmao.) But it is definitely possible to make money still. For time commitment questions I was able to do all of this and I am a full time student in college applying to med school in the summer. So definitely manageable, I quit my part time job and now only do this to make money to get me through school.",

Then I adjust the messaging — add a specific hook, refocus the clip for a certain audience, or mix in a CTA.\n\nIt’s not about cutting trending videos that everyone else uses — it’s about repurposing content you’ve already made in a way that feels platform-native and clear.\n\nThat’s how content creators and marketers actually save time.",

          "body": "Bonus arbitrage is a decent side hustle that can make you an extra couple hundred each month. You look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

Every business today needs video content for Instagram, TikTok, ads, and even Google listings. Restaurants, barbershops, gyms, coffee shops, real estate agents, and online stores all need simple videos to promote their services.\n\nThe good thing is that you do not need to film anything yourself. You can use stock footage, templates, and AI tools to create professional looking videos quickly. The part that used to be the most difficult, the voiceover, is now solved easily with AI voiceover tools, so you can generate clean narration without recording anything.\n\nYour computer becomes your production machine. You can offer monthly video bundles to local businesses, and many will pay because they always need fresh content.\n\nThis is far more profitable and realistic than trying to use your PC for mining.\n\nI also explain more in my blog posts.

      "selftext": "so I want to share just an idea of mine for making money, this is just a theoretical idea, I did NOT test it and not sure if you really can make money with it, theoretically you should be able...\n\nI’m sure all of us get a lot of spam emails... a cousin from Nigeria that left you some big money, you're a winner of some kind of lottery, Bitcoin earning... and many of them... and all of these spam emails either want you to download something (never do not download) OR just want you to send them something, like photo of bank account, credit card... or other things.\n\nso my idea is related to those spam emails that expect from you some response with files/images...\n\nI like to call it \"spam a spammer\"\n\nso like steps to do:\n\n1. Create a totally new email account (gmail I think is the best, and never do NOT use your real email)\n2. Expose your email publicly, so like write your email on any kind of forum, blogs... everywhere... so main idea here is for spammer parsers to find your email and just include it in their spam list. Here you could focus on niche, like expose email just on money maker forums for example\n3. Find some affiliate network that offers Pay Per Download, so if someone will download via your affiliate link - you earn money\n4. Upload to that affiliate network a couple of files, like image/png, pdf... and most important give them a real name like Fullname Password front, Bank account statement... and so on... so like to look like a real one\n5. The most important... for your email create a vacation autoreply to all, and here just create a nice message but not like a vacation reply, but to look more real, like replying to a real email... so like thank you, I’m glad I finally won something bla bla... and like in the end attach all the links to the affiliate downloaded files... so like to mention, here are my password front photo... here is my bank statement... so main idea is for the spammer to really think that you believed him and you sent him back real info\n\n...and then just wait for results... I mean you could just forget about these emails... it will work automatically for you\n\nso again, this is just one of my theoretical ideas that I’m not even sure will work at all...\n\nmaybe here someone will want to try or maybe tried something before and wants to share thoughts on this...",

          "body": "You can try bonus arbitrage, which can probably make you a couple hundred each month. Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

On the 13th of Nov which I’m writing this, we have generated 2.7k (it might be not alot for others, but its a huge milestone for me) in sales. I have gained alot of new clients (sadly no recurring ones tho). Hyped to keep on going. Follow for more updatessss :)   \n  \nedit: if you guys are new here, check my last 2 posts where I talked about my progress since starting the agency.",

Ads, as you can see, are now live on the site and have been for about 10 days.\n\nSo far, the RPMs are abysmal, only getting around $4 session RPM. I was hoping for $10 but this seems a bit far fetched for now.\n\nThat said, RPMs should increase as Mediavine continues to optimize ad placement and I hopefully continue to increase traffic. \n\nI am in their lowest rev share tier (75%) right now and this can get as high as 90%. \n\nBut in order to hit those tiers, I will have to significantly increase traffic - and I have done a bad job at that this month.\n\nMonthly traffic is still at 31k sessions, so no increase since the last update. \n\nWith the desktop app and especially with ads, this is all about scaling traffic (assuming I retain the same share of tier 1 country visitors). \n\nFor November, the tool site will probably make around $300 with sales of the app and ads. Idea is to reinvest every cent the side project makes into linkbuilding and maybe a few YouTube sponsorships (for the desktop app) down the line. \n\nStarting this, I always knew that it would be a 10 year side project and that the first few years would be somewhat slow.\n\nBut with ads now live, I am more confident than ever that I'll eventually get this to $10k in monthly revenue!",

          "body": "$4 session RPM doesn’t seem bad at all, but honestly despite constantly researching the terms used to calculate ad revenue I still find all of it extremely confusing. Would session RPM be roughly converted to page RPM by diving by average pages per session? So if your session RPM is $4, and users view 2 pages on average, your page RPM is $2? If they viewed 4 pages it would be $1, and so on? I run a tool based site as well (mine are image generators more for entertainment, not practical tools like yours, but I think on-site user behavior would still be similar). I’d love to compare numbers if you’re interested to see how our ad metrics compare. I really have no point of reference for if mine are good or bad - every source online cites wildly different averages.",

At first glance, it doesn't make much sense and is full of paradox. But there more you read and re-read it, the more you understand it.\n\nIn the west, we really believe that grit, hard work and individual brilliance determine outcomes. The Tao Te Ching suggests that individual success is underpinned by aligning ourselves with the patterns of the existence, in entrepreneurship it's aligning ourselves with the flow of current and future economic patterns. \n\nWhat you choose to work on and timing, has 1000X more impact than how hard you work or how brilliant you are. An engineer can spend 1000 hours building the next bitcoin and generate literal trillions of value, or can spend the same 1000 hours on a project that is never sees the light of day. Build bitcoin too early and there's no interest, too late and it exists.\n\nIt's not a business book but gives you a completely new lens to look at the world.",

Here are a list of books (in no particular order) that I've found useful that have helped me in my journey in building my businesses (NOTE: I am close to my liquidity event, so a lot of my current research revolves around what to do with the cash from my exit in my family office. I should walk away, after tax, with low/mid 9-figures.): \n\nAny of the Rich Dad/Poor Dad Series by Robert Kiyosaki: Great for mindset and understanding how money and business works.\n\nMultifamily Millionaire (vol 1 and 2) by Brandon Turner, et. al.  Great for understanding real estate and how it really works. \n\nThe Due Diligence Handbook for Commercial Real Estate by Brian Hennessey: Understanding what to look for in buying CRE. \n\nFamily Wealth by James E. Hughes, jr. How to deal with wealth over generations (yes, I know most of you are not at this point, but it's good to start with the mindset of \"I'm already wealthy and so I'll start acting and behaving in that manner now\"). \n\nThe 10X Rule by Grant Cardone. Mindset and focus (yes, I know Cardone is either loved or hated. I feel neither way towards him. I'd never invest with him in his real estate ventures, but there are lessons in this book).\n\nThe encyclopedia of Real Estate Advice by Terry Painter: Understanding better how real estate and works and why it's important to buy assets and not liabilities.\n\nThe Internet of Money by Andreas M. Antonopoulos. Read the entire series. It's eye opening.\n\nThe Big Print by Lawrence Lepard. Truly understand the shell game that is money. Once you understand it and realize that you are NOT going to change the game, you can focus on profiting from the game (the game you can not change).\n\nThe Almanack of Naval Ravikant by Eric Jorgenson. Great insights!\n\n\n\"Relentless\" and \"Winning\" by Tim Grover. Serious motivation on what it takes to succeed at a high level. I relisten to these at least every year or two.\n\nThe Creative Dealmaker by Carl Allen. How to do 'buy and build' businesses. Why fuck around with a start up (since most fail), why not target an already successful business that you can take to a higher level.\n\nThe 1% Rule by Tommy Baker. If everything is a priority, then nothing is a priority. How to hyper focus on the most important things that move your business and your life forward\n\nNegotiation Genuis by Deepak Malhorta and Max Bazerman: Learn how to negotiate\n\nPeak by Robert Pool and Anders Ericsson: How to master the skills that matter for your success\n\nThe Bitcoin Standard by Saifadean Ammous. 3/4 of the book is about understanding money and how the economy really works and the role bitcoin might play in that moving forward. One of the best books I've read this year.\n\nThe Blue Ocean Strategy by W. Chan Kim. Get out of the red ocean and find/create a blue ocean. This is the mindset whether you're starting a business or buying an existing business\n\nThe Big Rich by Bryan Burroughs. True story of the Texas oil boom and what happened to those involved.  Completely worth a read...filled with life and business lessons.\n\nAcquisitional Wealth by Josh Tolley: How to buy an existing business and grow it. \n\nThe Art of Selling your Business by John Warrilow: Start with the end in mind.\n\nRead everything that Pat Lencione writes.\n\nBuy Then Build by Walker Diebel: Why risk a start up...buy an existing business. This book teaches you what to look for and how to do it.\n\nRead Adam Coffey's books, Empire Builder, The Exit Strategy Playbook, The Private Equity Playbook.\n\nThe Trillion Dollar Coach by Eric Schmidt: Just read it...NOW.\n\nAngel Investing by David Rose: You need to understand the game of raising capital no matter what side of the table you're sitting on. This gives you insight into the buy side (angel investor side) of the table. You better understand their mindset\n\nAngel by Jason Calacanis. Understanding Angel Investing. Whether you're an Angel or seeking Angel money, you need to understand the game.\n\nThe Power Law by Sebastian Mallaby: Again, understanding the game of angel, VC and PE. \n\nHigh Output Management by Andy Grove. High level stuff, but worth a read so you can understand what your COO/Operations person is doing and how to build a great team.\n\nThe Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz: Just read it.\n\nThe Path Between the Seas by David McCullough. Why would I recommend a story about the building of the Panama Canal? Because it's one the best books I've ever read and it's filled with life and business lessons. Plus, no matter how bad you think you've got it...no matter how difficult your problems seem...they are NOTHING compared to what these men (and women) went through to make engineering marvel become a reality.\n\nTitan by Ron Chernow: Biography of Rockefeller. So worth the read.\n\nMellon by David Canadine. One of the greatest men of the gilded age...whether you like him or now.\n\nThe Power Broker by Robert Caro: If you want to understand how politics works...if you want to understand the two pillars that drive everything in the world (Power and Money)...then read this book. It may be the best book I've ever read.\n\nThe LBJ biography series by Robert Caro. The BEST biographical series I've ever read. LBJ was Caro's hero. As Caro learned...never meet your hero. LBJ is (IMHO) the greatest politician in the history of America. And I say that as someone who things he's one of the worst presidents ever. If you truly want to understand politics...read this fucking series NOW. The section on \"Box 13\" is MINDBLOWING.\n\nThe House of Morgan by Ron Chernow. Understand how a great business was built that changed the world.\n\nSo far in 2025, I've read/listened to almost 200 books at least once. In 2024, I listened to and/or read 150 books. This is a partial list of books that I found worthwhile over the last 23 months. \n\nI hope there is a gem or two in this list for the group.",

I was listening to a podcast (dont remember who) years ago and this woman name Dr Carol Robin created a successful course called touchy feely that helps people develop better communication and leadership skills. She wrote a book on it called Connect and said she hopes it sells well but wasnt sure because you can't just read the book and develop those skills. It ended up not selling well based on the number of Amazon reviews and you really need to be in a classroom with a bunch of people to talk to for it to work. \n\n\nI'm not saying books are a waste of time but people really need to apply themselves with what the book teaches which can usually involve a lot more work than people want to do. I actually think there's probably a lot of good YouTube channels that can help people succeed but its hard to filter through them to find the good ones. Some of them are actually successful and some only talk about being successful hoping their YouTube channel will take off so they can sell courses on how they did it or something lol. ",

      "selftext": "It's a dumb question. You're not dumb, just maybe uninformed, which I will rectify shortly. But the question is very, very dumb.\n\nFirst off, people who ask \"what business should I start?\" are really asking \"how can I make a lot of money?\"\n\nStraight up, starting a business is a crappy way to make a lot of money. Statistically most people lose money. You're probably going to lose money. So, if you want to make a lot of money, get into management consulting or ibanking, which generally means getting an MBA. Have fun with that.\n\nSecondly, people who ask \"what business should I start?\" generally think that businesses are fungible, which means they're a commodity or easily swapped out with one another. This, btw, is why most businesses fail. Because people think that businesses are just this thing that you start and money comes out the other end.\n\nIf I said a great business is rolling up a bunch of dentist practices, would you know what to do with that? Like, do you have dentistry experience? Do you have PE experience rolling up companies? If the answer is no to both, don't fucking roll up a bunch of dentist practices. It requires skills you don't have.\n\nIf I said, \"ooh! ooh! ooh! AI, baby! AI is gonna change everything,\" are you especially good at AI? If you're not, then one school of thought would say that AI is a growing market, so you should learn AI and sell those services to other people. There's another school of thought that says every fucking person and their grandmother is learning AI right now so they can sell  services to other people and I really wonder what you are going to discover about AI that's going to make you better than my grandma.\n\nLastly, markets aren't interchangeable either.\n\nI spent nearly 30 years starting tech companies. Had a few successes and a bunch of failures. Now, I'm a world-class startup coach. I do that job exceptionally well, I have great word of mouth, make a lot of money. And when I started, I knew A LOT of people in several startup ecosystems. My access to that market helped me get off the ground and eventually scale this business.\n\nIf I decided to start a company selling shit to celebrities, I would fail. I would 100% fail. Why? I don't know any celebrities. I don't have access to that market and I'd probably run out of money and time before I figured out how to get celebrities' attention.\n\nStop asking what business you should start. They aren't lego bricks.\n\nHere's a much better question to ask yourself: what do I love to do?\n\nFind something you love to do. Get good at it. Prove that you're good at it by selling your services to other people, either as an employee or a contractor. Get promoted and get a great title. Or become a consultant, which is just a contractor who charges a shit ton of money.\n\nGet so good at what you love that you know things about your job and market that no one else knows about. Understand secrets about your industry that give you a fundamentally unfair advantage over everyone else. Even my grandmother.\n\nThen go start a business using that knowledge. That's the business you should start.\n\nEDIT: random spelling and grammatical errors. I type for shit.",

          "body": "I disagree. \n\nYou are speaking from the perspective of someone who has been in business for decades, but most of the people who ask these questions have never built their own thing. They might have fantasized about it, but they are either still in school or are shackled by a 9 to 5.\n\n  \nStarting a business is really hard. It is scary, risky, and almost everyone you know with a 9 to 5 will deride you for the decision.\n\nAnd one of the ways to make the journey easier is to build a community around you where you feel supported and advised.\n\nSo, when I see someone ask, \"What should I start?\", I am seeing someone who is scared to take the plunge and is trying to dip their toe. I see someone who is trying to diffuse their risk by asking for advice from more seasoned individuals.\n\nThat said, my main gripes are:\n\n1. I don't mind you asking, but I do mind you failing to execute on it. At the end of the day, you just have to take the leap, especially if you are still starting out. \n\n2. It is okay to ask for advice, but at the end of the day, you have to make up your own mind, and if you fail, you can't blame anyone else but yourself. In other words, don't start a business because others told you to, start it because you believe in it.\n\n3. Building a business is a marathon, not a sprint. There are no shortcuts, no viral hacks, and no expert tactics to help you leapfrog the competition. You need to put in a ton of elbow grease and understand that the best quality you can have is grit.\n\nSo, my perspective is ask for advice but then do something about it.",

          "body": "This is spot-on advice. Businesses aren’t plug-and-play; your personal experience, network, and genuine interest are what turn ideas into something real. The “what should I start?” question skips all the messy, important context of skills, access, and passion which business success actually depends on.\n\nIf you go deep where you already have advantage (skills, connections, hard-earned insights), you’re miles ahead compared to jumping into hyped markets you know nothing about. Money follows value and expertise, not generic idea picking.\n\nSo yeah start with what you love, what you’re uniquely good at, and where you know the inside angles. Build from there, iterate, and don’t worry about chasing the latest trend. Better to be excellent in a niche you know than mediocre in a market you just picked off a list.",

Some people genuinely want direction because they do not yet know what their skills translate into. It is fair to say that industry access and expertise matter, but people also grow into skills and markets through experimentation, not just decades of experience first. Many successful founders did not start with a deep background. They learned by doing. Asking the question is often the first step for people who do not have mentors or exposure. You can push people to build competence without dismissing the question as dumb.",

Don’t get me wrong I’ve been an entrepreneur since I was in high school. Mostly re-selling. Some side hustles made money and some did not. Some just wasn’t worth the time. This side hustle finally paid off. I quit my full time job back in February 2025 and have made $113K in profits (net) so far in 2025. Hopping to hit $150k in profits by the end of the year with the Thanksgiving &amp; Christmas rush.\n\nJust wanted to say, if you’ve tried and failed, like I have multiple times. Don’t give up! \n\nI’m hoping to expand my business to other islands in Hawaii and yes I’m definitely “scared” but you never know unless you give it a try. ",

I planned well, but just felt silly explaining my decisions to people especially at the start when money wasn't coming in. But the best parts have been that I've done so many things I was once afraid of doing, cold emailing people, randomly messaging people to ask for advice from strangers, asking for more help, learning to see the bigger picture, understanding that money is in abundance even if it's not in abundance in my bank account yet, but I've learned better mindsets. I've gotten so many rejections that right now it almost doesn't phase me. I mean it hurts but my mind is all about going all to keep exploring and experimenting and seeing what works and what won't work. Like I'm going beyond my limits. Not having enough money is also scary as hell! I've learned more about human psychology, marketing is more about showing than telling. You'll almost never be sure many times, but just go for it. I've read some incredible books that have also helped me out. One I am reading now is called Sprint by [Jake Knapp](https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb/collections/author-books-by-jake-knapp), another that I read was The E-Myth Revisited, why most small businesses fail and why others don't. Something like that. I began seeing revenue by my 2nd month in operation. It was slow but I learned to document what was working on Notion, parts of the work I disliked and what I could do better.

It opens your mind the the most important aspect of business which is get a customer and get them to pay. Nothing else matters if you have 0 sales. Once you witness the full process of sales it expands how you think about business systems. 2. Start something incredibly simple to get a grasp of all the functions. Sales , marketing, operations, finance, opening an LLC, accounting and tax. You get a taste of how all this stuff works. You can do it on the weekend. Like junk removal or auto detailing. Simple businesses you can start with $1000 or less to get experience. Then jump into a high leverage opportunity once you have clarity from action. Clarity comes from action not thinking or watching youtube videos. In my opinion the perfect simple service business for you to start would be test prep or tutoring. Lets say you were really good at preparing for test prep. Go tape 50 signs around campus saying, \"Test prep $40 off and guaranteed 20% improvement on test scores with 4 session minimum\".

What broke me out of it wasn't finding the \"perfect\" opportunity, it was realizing I was using research as an excuse to avoid starting anything real.\n\n\n\nHere's the thing about those markets being \"oversaturated\" - that's usually code for \"competitive but still profitable if you're actually good at it.\" I spent 2 years convincing myself everything was too crowded while sitting on my couch doing nothing. The people making real money aren't worried about saturation because they're focused on execution, not excuses.\n\n\n\nStart with something you can begin this week, not next month. Pick ONE thing from your list (I'd personally go with running ads since it's skill-based and businesses always need it) and commit to landing your first client within 30 days. Don't worry about scaling to 10k yet, worry about proving you can deliver results for one person. Most people never make it past the first client because they're too busy planning their empire instead of doing the boring work of getting good at something.\n\n\n\nThe corporate ladder isn't going anywhere if you need to fall back on it, but you'll never know what you're capable of if you keep researching instead of executing. Time moves whether you're building something or not.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.",

You’re just early enough to be seeing the highlight reels of people who’ve been grinding for years and mistaking that for everyone’s doing it but me. Trust me, most of those 10k/month people you see online either, already had skills, already had money, or they conveniently don’t show you the 18 months they made nothing.\n\nabout the everything feels saturated thing, you’re not wrong. A lot of these spaces are saturated because people jump in blindly, copy whatever a guru says, and expect money to fall out of the sky. That’s why most fail.\n\nI’ll tell you what I tell anyone I’ve worked with, online income isn’t hard because the business models are bad. It’s hard because people underestimate the skill part. You mentioned ads which is a perfect example. Ads used to be a cheat code. If you run ads before building trust, you’re basically burning money. People don’t buy because they saw your ad. They buy because they trust the person behind the ad.\n\nI’ve seen people throw 500- 2k into ads with zero return because the foundation wasn’t there. Same with ecom, with digital products and with high ticket offers.\n\nEvery single model requires, knowing how to build a brand, knowing how to market without being annoying, learning how to create demand, learning how to communicate value, consistency and actual patience\n\nNobody wants to talk about those parts because they’re not lavish\n\nAnd yes, start while you’re still working. Anyone telling you to quit your job and go all in is setting you up to panicbuild instead of grow. Your job buys you time, reduces pressure, and lets you actually learn instead of chasing quick wins.\n\nIf I were starting at 20 again, I’d pick one model that actually aligns with my strengths, get the right education around it (whether through paid programs or months of deep research), and treat the first 6 months as skill building not income chasing. Real money comes once you stop trying to get rich fast and actually learn how the machine works.\n\nIf you want to talk specifics or narrow down what fits you, I don’t mind helping, been in the space a while and I’ve seen what actually works versus what just looks good on social media",

If you get an idea just take action and test if it works and makes you some money. Yeah you have to give it time to see if it works but the steps for every model for the online space are almost the same. Not to be general and cliche the steps are get an idea, build a website or mvp with a waiting list or form, market your idea either social media organic or running ads to that website, and track absolutely everything. Scrolls, clicks, all the data you can gather collect it because later it will be useful. But yeah that’s the jist of things.

That sounds counterintuitive. But I see this a lot from people who want to start a business.\n\nMy advice is to pick an industry you have interest in. Don't pick something based on potential income. Pick one that you want to learn and will stay motivated to improve in.\n\nThen decide how you can offer value to others in that field. Work with people in the industry. Take on positions where you work for cheap or free to learn the trade.\n\nI know this sounds crazy but a \"boring corporate job\" is an excellent place to learn and gain experience.\n\nWorking hard in my corporate job is what gave me the skills to go independent.

I met him through FB when he messaged me after I posted some Google Business Results from another client of mine, and after some talking back and forth, he agreed he wanted to give it a go. Things were great, rankings were moving, client was very responsive. Essentially, everything I could ask for until eventually he decided to go against my word in favor of a buddy he knows. Whatever right it's his business, but this eventually became a constant theme and would leak over into our work. Before you know it, these \"Suggestions\" his buddy was making would move our rankings from number 2 in the map pack generating 50-60 calls a month down into the top 5 where calls were still good but nowhere near the same, and you could feel there was no bottom/end to this until eventually he fired me when I refused some of the vital changes he wanted.\n\nI didn't take it to heart, aside from the friend stuff he was a good guy so we parted ways but I guess things continued to drop in ranking once I left. Now fast forward to a few months out and I guess he's convinced himself that I'm doing voodoo black hat magic against his business. Like I said interesting scenario but I can asssure you I'm not tampering or doing anything and it actually pisses me off a little that he would assume that, considering my only goal in the first place was to help him out and I even gave that little rat a discount when he first signed. I'm a little heated but what do you think the best way to tell him to F\\*\\*\\* off is without escalating this any further?",

Cease all informal contact.\n* **Demand Absolute Specificity:** Require a comprehensive and formal submission detailing their claims, including:\n   * A detailed, itemized list of all alleged grievances.\n   * A precise monetary value assigned to each alleged damage, supported by a thorough justification of how that value was calculated.\n   * A complete list of any and all potential witnesses, including their full contact information.\n   * Certified copies of any and all documentation they believe substantiates their claim.\n\n**The Strategy:** The endless requests for documentation and strict adherence to arbitrary procedures are designed to exhaust their energy and motivation. This isn't about winning an argument; it's about making the process so arduous that they give up.\n\n**Your Demeanor:** Your calm, composed, and detached tone is your greatest asset. It subconsciously de-escalates the situation. By refusing to engage in an emotional exchange, you control the entire dynamic of the interaction.\n\n**Advanced Tactics:** Invent your own internal \"policies\" for handling such disputes. For example: \"It is the policy of this respondent to require all financial claims to be substantiated by no fewer than two independent, certified appraisals.\"\n\nYou can also quote long, fabricated policy statements in your responses to further bog them down in procedural quicksand.

Second, centralize a simple asset table with fields for owner, status, serial, issue date, and return date, and automate a nightly digest that flags missing or overdue devices. For tooling a lot of teams stitch together a ticketing tool like Jira Service Management or Zendesk with an inventory table in Airtable or a DB, and then use whatever BI layer your team already uses to run weekly audits.

You can always get replacement but you won't grow if you are still trying to get coffee for your employee who's doing nothing.",

For instance, learning a lot about M&amp;A (merger and acquisition) or how to manage 1,000 employees when you're first week into your business is pointless. Yeah it sounds cool because big players do it, but you don't need to learn those at first.\n\nThis is also why building a good team is important, so that you're not just one person trying to learn so many skills.

Technical skills like basic coding, app development, or understanding digital tools help you bring ideas to life. \n\nMarketing skills-including social media, email campaigns, SEO, and content creation-are essential to reach and engage your audience. Business and financial skills help with planning, budgeting, and managing revenue. Social and communication skills allow you to network, negotiate, and collaborate effectively. \n\nFinally, a growth-oriented mindset-resilience, adaptability, and problem-solving-ties everything together and keeps the business moving forward.",

          "body": "Based on the consensus across this thread and real-world experience, here's what actually matters for online businesses and apps: First, sales and marketing are non-negotiable. I've seen technically perfect products fail because the founder couldn't communicate value or reach customers. Second, develop a relentless problem-solving mindset rather than chasing perfection in every skill area. Third, focus on customer discovery before you build anything - this saves you from building something nobody wants. Fourth, understand basic business fundamentals like cash flow and unit economics. Finally, consistency matters more than perfection at the start. The businesses that survive aren't run by experts in everything, but by people willing to learn what they need to learn when they need to learn it. Your biggest early wins will come from customer conversations and sales, not from having the perfect tech stack. Get out there, talk to real people, and start with whatever version of your idea will let you test assumptions quickly.",

          "body": "Here's my take. I used to run a construction business but taught myself how to build software. I developed my own crm, some marketing software, built the website and self hosted everything off a server in my apartment. On the plus side my office overhead was like $20/month for all the software we used because I built it.\n\nI tossed around the idea of starting a software company but I'm hesitent. Here's my take:\n\n1. As a non technical founder, you don't have the depth of knowledge to understand if a specific software stack is actually profitable. Most \"tech bros\" actually jam together a bunch of services and put their logo on it and call it \"their software\" when in reality they are paying 6 other companies for access to THEIR software. Basically you \"own the brand\" but not the actual software.\n2. Profitability is in the stack and not necessarily what the software does. For example, my website + lead gen software cost me $3/month. If you use wix, or another website builder, you'd pay $25-$50/month for the same service I get for $3 because I built it myself. So, if you don't create a \"software moat\" it's likely you'll end up using multiple other vendors to build your \"stack\" and end up bleeding all the upside in monthly API fees. If you build an AI automated CRM (for example) but you plug into AWS and GPT for api calls and hosting, you'll rack up $1000s/month in \"fees\". If you host the CRM yourself and train a small AI model, you're overhead would be near 0.\n3. The market is flooded and I mean FLOODED, with software. Unless you are excelent at sales and marketing, you'll struggle to provide any real value that other, larger companies don't. And, software behavior is very entrenched, people don't switch tools if ever. For example, a CRM, getting a company to switch from Microsoft to my CRM would be a nightmare and then try integrating it with their other workflows...just a huge hassle.\n\nAnyway, I'm not saying you can't do it. But from my perspective unless the software is self contained and built and the \"moat\" is in the stack - ie, cheap to actually scale, it's not an easy business to get into. Alot of the software bros you'll see either developed some niche tool that happens to solve some deep industry specific issue, OR were given a bunch of money and are living on hype and debt.\n\nTLDR \n\n  \nSo, is it worth it? Idk maybe lol. You don't need to be technical to sell something, but being technical helps because you can cut costs.",

Unless you’re doing deep tech, where it’s like making robots or mapping genome, I’d say it would not hurt to roll up your sleeves and build a prototype. \n\nEspecially if it’s software, an app, or whatever. The experience will allow you to learn the ins and outs of the industry much better than market research would; for example I learned the hard way why all attempts at doing what we’re doing failed and it was exhilarating to actually have a breakthrough. \n\nBut yea, especially with AI, whether it’s figma or Claude code, you can most definitely get a prototype up and running in a month at the longest. This will help you scope out what you actually need, use it to talk to potential cofounders, show it to customers, and demo to investors.",

Most early startups fail not because of tech, but because no one is driving vision, customers, operations, and sales. I run my own business too, and honestly the business side is a whole skill set on its own. If you’re good at strategy, execution, and actually making things move, a technical cofounder will see you as an asset, not a gap. Tech can be learned, but the ability to build, sell, organize, and lead is a lot rarer.",

I had clients, stability, and a decent income.\n\nBut I was solving the same problems again and again, manually.  \nAt some point, I realized that if I wanted to scale what I was doing, I'd have to build a tool that could do it better, even if that meant replacing myself.\n\nSo I decided to go all in.  \nI'm not technical, so I hired engineers to help me build it.  \nSince June, I've spent around €35,000 (my own savings) on development. I've got about €25,000 left, and I'm still not sure if it will work. There are no paid users yet, just some early testers.\n\nStill, I'm convinced this is the right path. I've spent years deep in this problem, and I know the pain points better than anyone. If founder-market fit exists, this is it for me.\n\nIn two weeks, I'm launching publicly on LinkedIn and in a few communities. After that, I'll start raising a pre-seed round.\n\nIf it works, amazing.  \nIf it doesn't, I'll be out of savings and back to square one, but at least I'll know I tried.\n\nCurious how others here handled this phase:  \nWould you ever bet your savings on your startup before validation?",

Remember the noise you hear will never be about the failures. For every win you see, there are 10,000 failures. Be positive you want it before you start.\n\n2. If you don’t know what kind of business you want to start with the 50k, I revisit my point above. You need to want it so bad to push through the “I can’t pay my bills next month” times that will inevitably come. In order to do that, you need to either love what you’re pursuing or at least thoroughly enjoy it enough to push through the hard. Cause there will be a lot of it. \n\n3. If you have 50k, 2-3k should be used to actually start the business + sheer hustle. The remaining 47k should be used to get you through making jack shit or being u profitable for X amount of time. Don’t overshoot too early, you likely won’t need half of the shit you’ll invest in before you actually get started. \n\n4. Most importantly, if you’re getting into business because you don’t want to work for someone else - be VERY careful about the business you choose, the way you set it up and how much overhead you take on. Cause what you’ll see happen without even noticing it happening is becoming an employee to your own business. Remember to OWN your business, don’t let it own you. \n\nHope this all helps!

The problem is the process for getting it registered is so quiet complicated. \n\nIts basically under the table and i have no proof of income coming from it.

Im the only one who knows this and i just want to share it with strangers here in reddit.\n\nI cant share it with family or friends cause I feel like its wrong, its going to change my life and attitude for the worse because of pressure of trying to maintain my successful image , but at the same time i want to share my success or to brag maybe? Reddit became kind off my therapy and therapist.\n\nToday is a good day. I enjoyed the ferry ride and the scenery.

I’m hoping for some guidance across a few subreddits because I feel like I'm at a breaking point.\n\nI’m almost 40 and make about $70k a year, but after a lot of self-reflection and working with a professional, I’ve confirmed that my mental health issues are coming directly from the work itself. I’ve tried switching jobs, but everything I’m qualified for ends up being another desk job. And I just can’t do it anymore.\n\nI’d rather work 60+ hours a week *for myself* than keep forcing myself through a 9–5 where I’m chained to a computer. I don’t need to be rich—I just need to be stable and sane.\n\nI live in a rural area (Sayre, PA). Here, everyone and their cousin runs a handyman service, landscaping business, or garden business—so breaking into those feels like fighting over scraps. I don’t have a trade license, and I can’t afford to reboot a whole career while paying my mortgage.\n\n**But I** ***do*** **have $70,000 saved right now that I can put toward building something of my own.**\n\nMy question is:  \n**What can someone in my position reasonably do with $70k to break free from traditional office work and build a self-sustaining career?**\n\nI’m open to:\n\n* Service-based businesses\n* Mobile businesses\n* Online/remote businesses that *aren’t* corporate desk jobs\n* Buying equipment and starting something myself\n* Anything that gets me out of a cubicle and gives me control over my schedule\n\nI’m not afraid of long hours. I’m not afraid of hard physical work. I just need something that isn’t slowly destroying my mental health.\n\n**If you were in my situation—rural area, almost 40, $70k saved, burned out from office life—what would you do? What opportunities am I not seeing?**\n\nAny real-world advice or ideas from people who’ve made a similar transition would mean a lot.\n\nThank you.",

You need to love what you are doing, have the drive to stick at it no matter what, and the ability to do it well.  \n\nDoing what I do, something in the artisan space, it probably one of the easier paths if you are good at the kind of thing.

I get why you are done with the office stuff, and the fact that you have seventy thousand saved puts you in a very strong position.\n\nThe one piece of advice I would give you is this. Do not stop working under any circumstances. That savings buys you flexibility, not a full exit. What it really gives you is the chance to move into something lower stress and more tolerable while you build your own thing on the side. That can be a simple job, something physical, something that brings a bit of joy or at least does not drain you the way a desk job does. But having some income and staying in the working world matters a lot.\n\nIf you walk away completely, start a business, and it fails, coming back in will be much harder. Your work history stalls, your network gets cold, and your confidence takes a hit. If you keep even a part time job, you keep income, structure, and connections while you experiment.\n\nUse the seventy thousand to remove pressure, not to replace income. Let your business grow slowly and organically on the side. Test ideas, try small bets, learn what actually works for you. When the income from your business is consistently beating what you can earn with your time at a job, and it clearly needs more of your hours to keep growing, that is when you quit. Until then, adjust your job, lower your hours if you can, choose something easier if you need to, but do not stop working.",

And when it manages you it leads to depression and even suicide. You do not list your skill sets. So it is hard to say what would be good for you. Seventy thousand is not much. But you could start as a side hustle something until it paid enough to replace your day job. You might explore liquidation auctions, then list your products on, say, EBay. You can make a very good income. So many things one could do. But if I were you I would figure out what is going on internally that cause you not to have the ability to cope. I rather suspect the problem will follow you. We all must do things we do not enjoy. But we have the ability to wrap our brains around it and control it. Running from our problems can get very expensive.",

Its right on the water with a long dock and very beautiful\n\nWord has been getting around and last summer we started noticing people hanging around that weren't customers. One of our employees pointed out a camera. That's when we noticed a photographer and a couple were using our private dock for a photo shoot. I didn't really think anything of it.\n\nIt kept happening but what bothered me was it seemed like the photographers were being underhanded. They never asked for permission and would even pretend to be paying customers. They would pretend to look at things and then head out back. \n\nThen more photographers started coming. We had entire families dressed up for a shoot. Apparently word got out how pretty this place was for family pictures.\n\nI said something to one of the photographers and got an earful about how it's a public business that anyone  can access. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? I dont want to be a hard ass but we aren't a huge operation and it's annoying as fuck to have all these extra people around not buying anything.",

We have botanical gardens near us that are gorgeous and used for photos all the time, but they now require a photographer's permit to shoot on site.

There's nothing wrong about that.\n\nAlso when it comes to savings, you never know how people have mentally allocated their money. Maybe that's \"the kids' inheritance\" in her mind, or \"just in case\" money, or maybe she's already earmarked it for something expensive that she hasn't paid for yet. You have no idea, so don't make assumptions.\n\nFinally, as a rule: don't discount your services unless that's part of your business model. Instead, if someone needs to spend less, figure out what you can offer that is inside their budget. If you're normally $100 and she only has $75, figure out what you can offer (profitably) at $75. It's more fair and avoids these kinds of conflicts.\n\nDo the work because you agreed to and you're a person of your word. If you *truly* feel deceived, just decline future work from this person.",

Some of his clients owed over $100k, but most $30-60k. I wrote him emails, outlined my concerns that those clients didn't need us as bad as we needed them, that their balances were too high, that we couldn't swing those kind of outstanding balances. Every month was a struggle to make payroll but he wanted to believe and wanted other people to believe that money wasn't a big deal. \n\nAnyways fast forward, all those people stiffed him.

He was an M&amp;A broker and claimed breach of contract for $1m in damages on a $20m sale. \n\nHe cleverly requested a jury trial instead of a judge trial since thats the plaintiffs right too choose.\n\nHis whole case was based on a verbal contract even though all he ever did was exchange about 8 emails with the owners and sat in on one meeting. The jury ultimately decided this was enough to establish a verbal contract and voted unanimously after 10 minutes of deliberation to award him $1m -- I shit you not.\n\nVerbal contracts do hold up in court. I would assume you have emails and history to prove the same? I would advise consulting with a different attorney that knows contract law -- ideally on contingency if you feel like you have a strong enough paper trail.\n\nGood luck and dont give up just yet!",

      "selftext": "Small business has 15-20 employees. Most are part time, and a few are full time. One part time staff has asked if we plan to provide healthcare benefits (plus vision and dental) at some point. She has a daytime / full time job where she is getting benefits currently and said she would like to come over full time if we can provide benefits. She says that her current employer \"takes care of everything\" and that she does not pay any contribution to the plan. So I said I will look into it. For her plus her spouse and child, the total monthly premium on a mid-level package is about $2,200 per month if I did 100% employer contribution. For context she is support staff making $29 / hr.\n\nFor me it's too much of a stretch to justify at $26K annual benefits package for someone whose base is roughly $60K / yr. I could change the contribution rate to say 50/50, but then I'm not competitive with her current FT employer and I think the premium split at 50% would be prohibitive for her and her family anyway.\n\nSo the question is: how do small businesses do this? I know there are a lot of options out there, but for those of you that have been down this road, what did you learn along the way? What was the best option that you settled on? I'd really like to offer competitive comp packages, but health benefits seem especially difficult.\n\nThanks!",

We shop out our plan and our broker sends us dozens of options, so I know we're looking at the best rates out there; but I'm seeing annual 10-20% increases with decreasing benefit richness the past 5 years. That isn't sustainable, especially when I'm trying to keep pace with wages as well. I don't mind raising prices to keep up with it, but my business model is priced annually, so it can take some time to catch up.\n\nSome of this is population demographics.

Businesses,  unless they are a large group which can self fund their plan may have a chance if they really care out their PBM/specialty drugs. Not only that - but the value from healthcare today just isn’t there. It’s darn near impossible to get a primary care md, appt, much less specialty care. There are options to consider like direct primary care - and concierge medicine where people actually get to see a doctor on a regular basis.  At least there’s some continuity of care. Put it together with a major medical for catastrophic- and you may actually be able to get back to what it was before the ACA fully rolls back. Leverage a CannaRx for specialty meds.   What most people don’t quite understand is that insurance rates are based on a pooled population. The larger the pool, the lower rate for everybody whether you’re buying from the exchanges or whether you’re buying a private plan from a carrier.  Doesn’t matter. So what’s happening now is you’re getting a smaller pool. The people left in the pool pay more. =ALL insured people will pay more. There is no replacement for “Obamacare”  and it’s pretty clear the “concepts of a plan” is nothing.  So what’s the solution? Either talk to a broker about self- funding- to be safe you should have about $250k to even have that discussion. The other option is a voucher - not sure how fast that’s all getting repealed. You should talk to a small market broker. As a small employer- things are just getting more difficult (tariffs - direct and indirect impact), labor crunch-immigration, and this is one more measure to make it harder to retain good talent. I’m sorry. I had 3 locations and just shuttered 2 because of all of the above. Last year I saw the writing on the wall and re-og’d.

My former business partner hired a woman and she wanted no health insurance premium deducted from her paycheck. He just docked the amount she was going to receive from the amount of her premium. Employers of big companies get a break on costs, but not huge ones, so unless she’s coming from a government job, or a huge multinational, her take home is probably lessened by her employer covering the total cost.\n\nWhat I would do is, tell her that your cost to insure her is $2200/mo, you can have it so she pays 0, but it will be reflected in her hourly pay at take home. Sometimes I don’t think employees look at total compensation, paid vacation, sick and health benefits all cost money, so when we pay those out, it’s part of their total pay package. Some just look at the hourly rate and base it on that, which is unfair if you provide other benefits.",

Dad saved the money and the grandson spent the money like you said.\n\n\nI wouldn’t say that 100% accurate though and all depends on the family \n\nThere’s plenty of third and fourth and fifth generation businesses that are thriving \n\n\nAnd sometimes when a business fails, it’s been around for a long time. It’s not all about who’s only the company it’s hard to keep a business around for 80 or 100 years. … there’s a lot of moving parts meaning just because the grandson is running the business that doesn’t mean that it’s only their decisions that are causing the company to be in the situation. It’s in.\n\nSometimes it was not adapting quickly enough before and now it’s starting to bite them in the butt or bad investments made 20 years ago \n\n\nSo as a rule, I don’t think I agree with the premise, but I understand the idea behind it. The businesses that tend to be most successful or our family own businesses are the ones where the younger generation is required to work in different parts of the company, and not immediately given senior management role right after college\n\nGeneration X my generation might be more guilty of elevating our kids to higher positions of power too quickly in a company … any younger people tend to have a little bit more sense of entitlement than older generations, which is always been the case\n\nBut I can think of a number of very successful companies that are being run by the third generation right now",

      "selftext": "This is based in Ontario, Canada 🇨🇦 \n\nI am not mentioning names because I do not want legal issues, but I need to get this off my chest.\n\nA while ago I started providing cleaning services for a couple who owned an Airbnb. The husband acted like a big entrepreneur and constantly talked up his plans. His wife was an influencer with millions of followers. I barely ever spoke to her and she never communicated with me, but he kept bringing her up as if her follower count meant their business was legitimate.\n\nHis business partner was a realtor and the two of them acted like they were on the verge of building a large real estate empire. They told me they were buying 13 properties in Orlando and said I would get all the cleaning contracts. I run a cleaning agency and handle hiring, interviews, scheduling and operations, but I still let their hype get to me.\n\nLooking back, it is embarrassing how much I believed them.\n\nThey pushed me to lower my prices and told me I would make more long term because of the volume they would bring. Lower rates meant cleaners made less money and did not want to work their job, which caused constant staffing issues. They did not care. They just wanted cheaper labor.\n\nThey nitpicked everything. Small towel marks, tiny smudges, anything they could point to. One time four towels were slightly dirty. Instead of washing them, he ordered more than two hundred dollars worth of towels and cloths without asking and then made me pay him back for the order. He acted like he was helping me by explaining how to claim the HST.\n\nHe often acted friendly and gave me advice as if he was mentoring me, then switched into being demanding and controlling. The most insulting thing he said was, “You should not run a cleaning business if you are not a cleaner.” I run a real agency. I am educated and I manage the business. I do not need to personally scrub toilets to operate a company. His comment showed he did not respect what I built.\n\nSomething important is that during this time I kept asking him about Orlando. I told him I was planning to open a branch there. I told him I was hiring people. He knew I was taking the opportunity seriously and believed what he said. Despite that he kept lying about the 13 houses and the future work. He watched me prepare for something that did not exist.\n\nEventually my only Hamilton cleaner quit and after more than thirty hours of interviewing and reviewing applications I realized the entire situation was a dead end. Their budget did not match their expectations and every cleaner disliked going there. The promises were never real.\n\nI finally sent a formal message ending the relationship and telling them I would no longer be providing cleaning services. They never replied. No thank you. No acknowledgment. Nothing.\n\nThat silence told me everything.\n\nHere is the interesting part. Because of their constant talk about Orlando, I actually opened a branch there. I hired people and started operating. And somehow it worked. I am now running my agency in Orlando and so far it has been more successful than what I had in Hamilton. I never would have considered Orlando if it was not for their story, even though their own plans were fake.\n\nSo in a strange way, something good did come out of this. I just had to learn the hard way that not everyone who talks big is telling the truth.\n\nHere is what I learned:\n\nPeople connected to influencers are not automatically professional or honest.\nPeople who promise future opportunities often want discounts today.\nFriendly behavior does not mean respect.\nAnyone who tries to devalue your work is not a partner and never will be.\nSometimes walking away is the best business decision you can make.\n\n\n\n\nForgot to add:\n\nThe biggest red flag I ignored was the fact that they dropped their long time cleaner for my company. No warning to her, nothing. They just kicked her out to start using me. She was really good to them from what I heard &amp; only had a minor scheduling issue. Also, the main guy I was dealing with lied to me that “guests are refusing to pay the higher cleaning fee” when he never updated the cleaning fee on Airbnb from $120 to $200 (which is what I charged him). I know this because I checked the listing every day for new reviews. So that was also a ploy to get me to lower the cleaning fee… I’m probably forgetting some things.",

          "body": "The #1 problem I see with NetSuite, and it is not really their fault, is lack of clear operational process flow and inability of stakeholders to communicate their desired business outcomes to the NS onboarding team. \n\nCompanies that want to switch to NS should have written processes that cover operations, logistics, accounting, hr, finance, a clear chart of accounts, a clear understanding of how subsidiaries interact, and a good idea of access controls. \n\n#2 problem: I always ask, “Who owns it!” It’s rarely answerable. There must be at least two people to cover accounting and all aspects of operations. But there must be one boss. \n\n\nIn my opinion, accounting is God, but operations needs to understand that any sneeze that impacts the GL must be thought through. Ops people don’t get that. In fairness, accounting people don’t get ops. \n\nHR and CRM stuff can come later but those modules are really like cake decorations and perhaps better handled with outside systems and integrated into NS. \n\nYour CFO isn’t wrong, but there are a hundred things you should do before you engage with NetSuite. \n\nAsk AI to create a list of everything you should do before you make that discovery call. \n\nAmong them should be readable spreadsheets the NS engineers can decipher because you’re gonna want custom searches and reports setup to match the spreadsheet purgatory you created and wish to escape. \n\nNS will not really walk you through it. They assume you get them, they don’t truly need to get you, and you burn up all your support hours finding that out as they constantly switch their own internal support teams and leads around. \n\nHave only one leader to be 100% devoted to NetSuite and NOTHING ELSE. Not the CFO for goodness sake. Someone who has a broad technical background and expansive business mind who understands company systems impact and integration. \n\nIf you’re gonna invest in NS, make it count.\n\nEdit: I don’t know why the point above is bold but it works.",

The brand itself left a bad taste because all they saw was the owner... he immediately said no to rebranding, and they're currently shutting down because they've lost the remaining high-paying clients, struggle to get new ones, and he's fallen ill... \n\nI have so many similar stories. \n\nIf you are running a business, please, detach from it. It's not about you, it's not your value not your worth. If you operate within it, treat it as a job, not as your measure of success nor failure. Remove your pride and work on it as if you're a consultant, make moves as if you're a project manager. YOU ARE NOT YOUR BUSINESS, LET IT GO.",

The one non negotiable skill is adaptability in your decision making - changing direction quickly when the data and market punch you in the face.​\n\nResilience without adaptability just means you keep bravely driving into the same wall, and pure execution without adaptability turns into mindless grinding on a bad plan.​\n\nThe businesses that survive are the ones whose owners notice what reality is telling them and pivot products, pricing, marketing or operations faster than everyone else.​\n\nResearch on small business success keeps coming back to flexible management, willingness to experiment and adjust, and strong general management capacity, which are all functions of adaptable thinking.​\n\nSeen this pattern in the wild more times than I care to count - the stubborn genius with a “perfect” idea loses to the boring owner who keeps iterating.​\n\nHow do you build adaptability as a skill?​\n\nShorten your feedback loops: talk to customers weekly, track a few simple metrics, and decide every month what you will stop doing, not just what you will add.​\n\nGet comfortable testing small bets instead of going all in, so changing course feels like normal operations, not a personal failure.​\n\nFinally, learn just enough basic finance to see in black and white which experiments are actually paying for themselves, then double down or kill them quickly.​\n\nIf you consistently notice what is working, admit what is not, and adjust faster than your competitors, you can be mediocre at almost every other “entrepreneur skill” and still win.",

We sell into SMBs, Midmarket, and through resellers MSPs/MSSPs/Partners etc... our security awareness platform took us 5+ years to develop into anything with Product Market Fit (PMF).  Then we iterated over the last 6 years into something that we're proud of, something disruptive.\n\nNow that we're selling into Mid-market and planning for Enterprise sales we are securing our SOC2 Type II audit opinion (Q1 2026).  We're in heavy preparation mode now.  While we still don't truly need it, the expansion into midmarket and enterprise will be much easier if we can hand over our SOC2 audit opinion when pursing this business.\n\nThere IS enormous value for us in securing the SOC2. It has many strong prescriptions in it for the Security Controls such as penetration testing, endpoint protection, documented processes around change and incident management and so much more.  We do all these things as part of our vCISO service offering.  We even have helped others secure their SOC2 type II audits, but it was time for us to ensure everything was buttoned up in our own business and get the audit.  It helped focus our existing processes and refine them into truly operational procedures we follow.\n\nThe costs of SOC2 assessments have been coming down as well.  Traditional vendors like Drata, Vanta, SecureFrame, or you can save some time and money with some new AI start-ups (do your homework please).  One AI based startup in the SOC2 space is Delve.  We've gone with them and they are pretty responsive to our questions, and their value proposition was amazing in comparison to the larger more traditional Tooling vendors.\n\nUltimately, you can say no.  Just be prepared to get a lot of TPRM (Third Party Risk Management) questionnaires, and be sure to DO what you SAY YOU DO in your answers (they will check and ask for evidence until your get an Auditor confirmation of things in a SOC2 Type II).",

It's one of those things you don't need to do until you need to do it. The cost and time sink can be brutal early on. What I've found with most startups I've worked with is that most enterprise clients will send you a security questionnaire anyway, and SOC 2 is just one tick box - they still want to know about your encryption, access controls, developer training, all of it. So make sure your fundamental security is watertight first, then consider SOC 2 when you're actually losing deals without it. You'll know when that happens - suddenly every enterprise client will be asking for it.\n\n\\- Luke @ Baremetrics",

Alternatively you could pay yourself a bonus on your payroll at the end of the year. A competent CPA/accountant will tell you which you should do and how much.\n\nOne of the benefits to being on payroll is that if your business tanks and you shut down... you've paid into unemployment and can legitimately go on unemployment, or (another likely scenario) you get another job somewhere else, get laid off in a few months, and then you're still eligible for unemployment. And the other is workers' comp - if you get injured on the job, you'll be covered - this is far more valuable than a lot of people think it is.

There is one major player in our area that has bought up a bunch of smaller companies over the years, but they don't have a great reputation with customer service oddly enough. However they are branded well, have multiple officers and warehouses all over the area, you can't even hit a stop light without looking up with one of their vehicles. \n\nI've been tasked to help a company who is taking a slightly different approach to these contracts grow their business but of course that means going after monopoly contracts. These deals are multi-year so when you miss them it could be another 3-5 before you get a chance to bid again. A lot of them also have RFPs, so you can spend a week with a team combing through the details and building a very thought through proposal. \n\nIn the last 4 months, we have been told that we've won 9 contracts that would have been taken from this competitor, however, in every single instance, they had the option in their existing contract to price match and ultimately got to keep it themselves. All the time and effort we put in it just so the big guy can say yeah we'll do that is tiring. \n\nHow can you possibly get past this? \n\nIt's almost all about the money by the way. Corporations, hotel chains, HOA boards are the ones making these decisions. If they can squeak out more money for the deal that's all that matters to them unless someone royally screws up. The little things like we provide better customer service, we're technology focused, increase customer spending etc are all looked at as salesman fluff. \n\nAlso you don't get to meet with the decision makers very easily. Going after a Hilton hotel, the local GM has little say. Going after a neighborhood, there are a dozen people on the HOA board and you may have only spoken to one of them.\n\nWhat can be done here?",

Faster response times, better staff who are treated and paid better so are nicer to the customers etc. Whatever it takes.\n\nThis isn't foolproof though - if the customer has a checklist of requirements, then it's easy for them to overlook the nuances of the quality of those things, especially if they're procuring from head office, where checklists and price are all they're really going to look at....so you really need to go deep on how you are more than just A N Other supplier, so deep in fact that it becomes obvious that the BEST monopoly supplier can do is not even acceptable in your world.\n\nAlternatively, you can play the longer game. Note, I've seen this play out myself, but in the software world rather than services. The principle is the same, however.\n\nYou know when contracts are due up, so instead of waiting for the RFP to be issued, spend 12-18 months running up to it effectively demonstrating how your service is better. Attend relevant conferences and trade shows. Figure out a new process, give it a funky name. Make sure that by the time the RFP is being put together, your approach is already on their lips. Make it so those going shopping are already thinking about what you offer, and then be the ones to actually offer it.\n\nBasically, spend some time in the run up to contract renewals seeding potential clients with you, your approach, and how it's the right choice. The more subliminal / indirect, the better. If you can leave them wanting something and not even knowing who provides it until your proposal ticks every box, then you've done it perfectly.\n\nMake this large company compete with you, rather than the other way around.",

Most businesses work out of the survival paradigm (below 200 on the Map of Consciousness by Dr David R Hawkins), and with the poor reputation that the competition has, but first conclusion is that that company is way low on the scale. The company you represent needs to raise their energies above 200 on said scale. The reason for this is because the message it is broadcasting is \"I need you.\" (everything is energy and those energies are broadcasting messages in the form of frequencies), and those businesses above 200 sends out the message of \"You need me!\". As you are a niche business already, you need to figure out how to raise the bar, improve the energies and messages, and then do amazing!

So we switched to Gusto but it glitched a few times and trying to get a hold of the support team was really painful and slow. Now Rippling keeps coming up in my LinkedIn feed.

One of those is your expectations and metrics for success. Being her first market, not only are you new to buyers, but you're also new to other sellers, and likely also new to *selling* directly to people. There is so much that will passively go into this (\"Do I look nice?\" \"Does my products look nice?\" \"Man I must look like an idiot to all these other vendors\" etc etc). My metric for my first market was \"hand out 5 business cards and have one detailed conversation about the craft\" (I do custom game consoles if you're curious). I didn't sell anything at this market, but I didn't consider it a failure because I accomplished:\n\n* Learning how to set up at a market\n* Learning how to break down after a market\n* Practicing my pitch\n* Hearing different questions/comments people had and considering how I could better address that\n* Meeting some of the other vendors in my local market scene\n* Doing something new to me, which while not necessarily directly impacting my business, does help with leading a personally fulfilling life. It gets pretty boring to just to the same 5 things over and over, at least to me :)\n* Met my two pre-set metrics above! \n* Getting your name out there; if this is a recurring show and you go often enough you *will* get people to start recognizing you\n\nShe may or may not value the exact things I listed here, but I can pretty much guarantee that if she sits down and thinks about it she would be able to come up at least 2 positive things about the market, especially as a first go at it. One of the best things about having a partner is that they can help you see things you may be blind to because you're caught up worrying about one specific thing (like if you're the biggest idiot on the planet for thinking someone would be stupid enough to buy something you made), so you can thank my wife for helping me to see the positives of my first market where I sold nothing despite stressing for a month I didn't have enough inventory to even show up, lol. \n\nHope this helps, and glad to see you're trying to help each other out.\n\nAs a final note, I definitely suggest looking for juried markets. It will help to cut down on AI/MLM stuff, which no one actually likes to see which will hurt attendance for the show. I find if shows accept things like this they are more concerned with their booth fees vs putting on a good show for the vendors/attendees. If it is an option I suggest attending markets at the location and see what the vibe is like!",

Then I'd suggest you define what \"good\" looks like for your sales each week (X leads, Y quotes, Z conversions). Whats your target needed to reach your number?

I want to help you but I’d rather explain the difference between advice and criticism vs. responsibility and ownership \n\nI’d say everyone think that they’re experts and nobody business is going to be a constant uphill, eventually the fall of Alexander the Great was of his own greed and demise, so with that being said you haven’t even become great yet. \n\nAdvice comes from a place of love and kindness. Nobody who can give good advice thinks about themselves, they \nlove hearing stories and love the world in a way that we step out of our comfort zone and help others to find solutions for themselves that we didn’t even think of.\n\nIt is possible to turn this thing around, there is a way out!\n\nIt’s the way you present yourself and your business to its customers. \nSeparate yourself from your business and make sure that your business has everything it needs to succeed. You are the owner. \n\nOwnership and responsibility is apart of the equation. You can’t own up to your faults if you don’t know them.\n\nDon’t take it so harshly because you still made a good deal of money. Whatever you did in the beginning worked! Keep your head up and increase your network, once the network increases, your net worth increases.\n\nIt’s a shame, you do 3.5 million in sales and I don’t even know what your business is. Please contact our group let us know what you do and we can HELP you and give you our coins if we only knew what your business is.\n\nLet’s network together!",

So that’s all on the bad side. The good news is once you can figure out some stuff thru trial and error or even on here, u start to build *some* momentum. Get some courage. Some positive self talk like “ok I’ve been here before. Not in this exact situation but I’ve overcome a ton to even get here. 10 years ago if someone would’ve said this is the issue, I would’ve been happy to handle this challenge. I got thru this before and I can get thru this now.” \n\nTrust me, I get it. I’m going thru a very similar thing right now in my business. I’m in digital marketing and Google has completely screwed up my business model. I’ve been depressed about it for about 2 years now. Shit ton of work with very little profit to show for despite a lot of cash flow and 21 employees. Complete madness. I always thought I can turn it around. It looks like I cannot and I have to pivot. \n\nBottom line is this. Talk it out. If you don’t have anyone to bounce ideas off of that u trust and respect, take a few days and throw it into GPT. This thing is absolutely freaking amazing and will be your most logical partner. People are not getting good results because they haven’t tuned it. Out the box is pretty good but tuned up it’s absolutely freakin amazing!\n\nI wish you well. You’re not a failure. You just need perspective. You need to adapt. Just like me.
