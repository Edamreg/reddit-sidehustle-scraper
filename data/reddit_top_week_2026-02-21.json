Picked up a few one-off gigs on Fiverr for editing and voiceover stuff and that netted maybe $150. Also tutored a neighbor's kid twice a week and got about $100 out of that.\n\nI even tried Mistplay for a week just to see what it was like, no drama there, but it was barely a blip compared to the other stuff. Overall it was messy and tiring but the thing that surprised me was how fast selling things locally moved money. The reliable platforms and real gigs paid steadier than the random micro options. Not saying this is a plan, just sharing what actually happened when I was desperate and had time to hustle. Maybe others had similar mixes? idk.",

It's okay if they take a while to \"pay off.\" Basically, my depression has been really bad lately and since being hospitalized for it a couple weeks ago, I'm trying to prioritize activities that don't put me under a lot of pressure. I read and play video games, but it'd be cool to maybe start building a side hustle that slowly builds so I can feel proud of it someday. I don't have a ton to be proud of right now.\n\nI've thought of trying to do affiliate marketing on Pinterest and/or selling some cute digital assets on Etsy (I'm a big journaler and thought maybe the charts/etc I make for myself might be appealing to someone else?) but I don't even know where I'd start with that.\n\nI did sign up for a few sites and apps that send you free products to review, but I haven't received any offers yet.\n\nETA: I am a freelance writer by day, so that's covered :-) (And no, I don't recommend getting into it right now if you aren't already)",

After about three weeks I had maybe $10–20 worth of gift cards/points across everything and one app hit a payout threshold that took forever to reach. A couple of apps (Mistplay was one I tried) gave small rewards here and there but also felt like a grind, and one locked my account for a day which was annoying. \n\nIt wasn't a scam, more like a low-value time sink for me , fine if you want something mindless while watching Netflix, but not something I'd call a reliable side hustle.

Before the semester started, I quit my job because I was miserable and I knew I would get stable income if I enrolled again (I receive educational benefits). However, I still want money to spoil myself. I had issues getting my unis work-study application available to me before all spots were taken. I’m looking for a direct wage job, but in the meantime, would like a decent side gig. \n\nIve done both irl and online jobs, mostly customer service. Recently, I’ve been making my fun money with random construction gigs (my family has a business, but really only looks for work when money is tight) and online “modeling” and “acting” (I’m doing it anyways, why not record it and sell it 🤷).  \n\nI’m ideally looking for something less labor intensive than construction, less boring than work at home or less stressful constant phone calls. (I understand I might be picky, but I’m open to both ideal and realistic suggestions! Thank you &lt;3)",

Testerup is another one. If you have a good following/engagement on any social media you could do the Amazon influencer which if you get enough videos can bring in a decent amount of money. You can apply as many times as you want, too. With multiple platforms. It’s been brining in a very consistent income for me but it does take some strategy and time to make review videos.  Of course, dog walking and house sitting.. uber or Amazon flex. Lots of ways to bring in money utilizing AI, too.  Hope this is helpful.",

It was quite well received and even my most critical friends said \"no fair play that's pretty well done\". It was doing quite well, getting a couple of thousand views each week off maybe 2 posts per week. \n\nSadly it only lasted 7 months or so, I got my first grown up job which a) took up more of my time so didn't have the time to do the content b) I, stupidly, got a bit embarrassed by it because of the content and worried new colleagues would find it so I just stopped doing it. \n\nRecently, I've been thinking about starting it back up again, I've got a few ideas for content. Obviously this internet malarkey has moved on a bit recently so wanted some pointers about how to do it in such a way that it could be monetised. I'm guessing a just blog on blogspot isn't a golden ticket. \n\nFirst time round I enjoyed doing other stuff, e.g. I made a dumb video to go with one post and I also coded a really basic but addictive game based on the blog content (although it was unfinished so never published beyond a couple of friends) so willing to give other things a try, not just the blog itself. But I want to have a plan rather than just scatter gunning content and doing new things on a whim.  \n\nIf you're wondering it's a poo themed blog but I will stress it is tasteful and humorous, even my mum chuckled at it. \n\nMotivation is I'd like to make some pockey money doing something other than my boring af job.

Asking me questions about my world that got me to understand my own book better. -- Its biggest limits are organization and simplicity. Its not built for books necessarily.

They sell budgeting templates. Google Sheets and Notion stuff. The exact same category that like 10,000 other sellers are in.\n\nThey're doing $115K a month.\n\nI saw a breakdown of their whole operation and the thing that fucked with me is how *boring* the actual product is. It's not some revolutionary tool. It's a spreadsheet. You could download something similar for free in 20 minutes.\n\nThey took a commodity product and pointed it at one specific person. Not \"people who want to budget.\" Women who want financial independence. That's it. That's the whole thing.\n\nEvery piece of content, every ad, every product variation is just a different way of saying the same thing to the same person with a different pain point angle.\n\nTurns out they've been running 64+ ads for five months straight. 24 different product variations. But it's all one avatar, one core message, one niche they just kept going deeper into instead of wider.\n\nThe engagement on the case study alone was wild over 1,500 bookmarks. Which means people aren't just liking it, they're saving it to reference later. That tells you something.\n\nThe thing most people get wrong is that everyone's out here trying to build a better product. A more unique product. Something nobody's made before.\n\nAnd these guys are just selling a spreadsheet to a specific woman and making more per month than most people make in a year.\n\nThe positioning IS the product. The niche IS the moat.\n\nI spent like four months on my first product trying to make it different and interesting and useful for everyone. Sold it to basically nobody. Then I watched stuff like this and realized I wasn't solving a problem for a specific person I was just building a thing and hoping someone would want it.\n\nThe difference between a $200/month digital product and a $115K/month digital product usually isn't the product. It's who you're selling it to and how sharply you've defined that person.\n\nSame framework could work for men's budgeting, Gen Z investing, corporate finance nobody's doing it with that level of specificity.\n\nAnyway. Just something I kept thinking about after seeing this. If you're building something and wondering why it's not moving, it might not be your product. Might be that you're talking to everyone and reaching nobody.",

Like properly formatted ones I made for myself before exams, nothing crazy. Uploaded maybe 18 documents total and then just never thought about it again.\n\nLogged back in and theres $340 sitting there. Not insane money but its literally from doing nothing, the notes were already made, I just converted them to PDF and put them up.\n\nThe wild part is a few of them are still selling consistently. My corporate valuation summary gets like 2 or 3 sales a month still. I keep that money completely separate, its kind of become part of my saved money from Stаke pile that I use to fund other small stuff like this.\n\nIf youre in uni or just finished I genuinely think this is one of the most overlooked things. If you're someone who makes clean detailed notes anyway you might as well put them up somewhere.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been researching side hustles that actually work for my newsletter but every post it’s the same recycled advice. Start a podcast. Sell printables. Drive for DoorDash. Do surveys. I got tired of seeing the same surface-level ideas repeated by people who clearly weren’t doing any of them.\n\nSo I went deep into Reddit threads, Discord servers, and niche communities to find what’s actually working for regular people right now.\n\nHere’s what kept coming up again and again\n\n1. AI-generated influencer accounts\n\nThis one sounds wild but it’s real. People are creating entirely AI-generated personas using tools like Midjourney, Flux, and HeyGen, then running them as influencer accounts on Instagram and TikTok.\n\nThe persona posts content around a niche like fitness, finance, or tech reviews. Brand deals still come in because engagement is what matters, not whether the face is real. Some people are running two or three of these at once.\n\nThe key is picking a tight niche and staying consistent with the character so the audience feels like they’re following a real person.\n\n2. Hyperlocal newsletters\n\nThis is one of the most underrated plays out there. People are starting simple email newsletters covering local news, events, restaurant openings, and community stuff for their city or neighborhood. You write one or two emails a week using a free tool like Beehiiv or Substack.\n\nOnce you hit a few thousand subscribers, local businesses will pay surprisingly well to sponsor a slot. It works because big media ignores small towns and neighborhoods, so there’s almost no competition.\n\nA guy in a mid-sized suburb shared that he’s pulling in over two thousand a month just from a twice-weekly newsletter about his area.\n\n3. Claude chatbot setups for small businesses\n\nSmall business owners keep hearing about AI but have no idea how to actually use it. People are charging anywhere from three hundred to over a thousand dollars to set up Claude-powered chatbots and workflows for local businesses.\n\nThink automated customer support for a dentist’s office, a booking assistant for a salon, or a lead qualifier for a contractor. You use tools like Claude, Zapier, and Make to wire it all together. No coding needed.\n\nOnce you’ve built a few, you can reuse templates and the work gets faster every time. Most clients will come from cold outreach or local Facebook groups.\n\n4. Amazon KDP low-content and AI-assisted books\n\nKindle Direct Publishing is still quietly printing money for people who understand the system. The sweet spot right now is using AI to help research niches, outline content, and draft specialized nonfiction like study guides, prompt collections, niche how-to books, and curated resource lists. You’re not publishing AI slop novels.\n\nThe people doing well are targeting very specific keywords with real demand and thin competition. One person shared they were making around fifteen hundred a month from a catalog of about forty short books, most of which took a day or two each to put together.\n\n5. Twitter ghostwriting\n\nBuilding a personal brand on X is a grind, but plenty of founders, executives, and creators are willing to pay someone else to do it for them. Ghostwriters handle everything from drafting daily posts to writing long threads and managing engagement.\n\nPay ranges from five hundred to several thousand per month per client depending on scope. If you can write in a punchy, opinionated style and understand what performs well on the platform, this is steady recurring income.\n\nMost ghostwriters land their first clients by simply being active on X themselves and DMing people whose accounts look neglected.\n\n6. No-code iOS apps\n\nTools like FlutterFlow, Adalo, and Draftbit have made it possible to build and ship real apps to the App Store without writing a line of code.\n\nPeople are building simple utility apps, habit trackers, niche calculators, and local service directories, then monetizing through subscriptions or one-time purchases. The barrier to entry is lower than ever.\n\nOne person in a community I follow launched a niche workout timer app and was making around eight hundred a month within three months. The trick is solving a very specific problem for a very specific audience rather than trying to compete with big apps.\n\nNone of these require a massive upfront investment or some rare technical skill. They just take consistency and willingness to learn new things.\n\nI have written detailed posts about these on my [newsletter](http://wifimoolah.com). It’s free and I do not sell anything\n\nHas anyone here tried any of these or found other low-key hustles that are actually working right now?",

At least it’s specific.\n\nThe pattern across all of these isn’t “AI magic.”  \nIt’s distribution + niche focus + packaging boring work in a smarter way.\n\nA few thoughts:\n\nAI influencer accounts  \nThis works, but only if you treat it like a real brand. Most people underestimate how hard it is to build consistent content and audience trust. The ones making money aren’t just generating pretty images. They’re running it like a media business.\n\nHyperlocal newsletters  \nThis one is quietly strong. Attention is cheaper locally. And local sponsors convert because it’s high intent. But again, distribution is the game. If you can’t grow the list, it dies.\n\nClaude setups for SMBs  \nThis feels like the most durable one on the list. It’s not sexy, but small businesses don’t want to “learn AI.” They want outcomes. Lead capture. Booking automation. Follow-ups. Whoever owns that layer wins.\n\nKDP  \nStill works, but it’s keyword research and volume. Less “author,” more “operator.” Most people quit before they build enough surface area.\n\nGhostwriting  \nThe moat isn’t writing. It’s understanding positioning and audience psychology. Big difference.\n\nOverall takeaway for me:  \nThe real opportunity isn’t in the tactic. It’s in becoming the person who can package and systemize the tactic.\n\nCurious though - if you had to double down on just one of these for 12 months, which one would you actually bet your own time on?",

People are creating entirely AI-generated personas using tools like Midjourney, Flux, and HeyGen, then running them as influencer accounts on Instagram and TikTok.\n\n&gt;The persona posts content around a niche like fitness, finance, or tech reviews. Brand deals still come in because engagement is what matters, not whether the face is real. Some people are running two or three of these at once.\n\n&gt;The key is picking a tight niche and staying consistent with the character so the audience feels like they’re following a real person.\n\nIm interested in doing this for teaching english, any tips appreciated",

I’ve seen people use **Keyvello** to automate the entire production of these niches. It has these specific 'ASMR Food' and 'Satisfying' templates that handle the pacing and sound triggers automatically.\n\nIt's perfect for people who want to run 3+ accounts at once without spending 4 hours a day in an editor. If you’re already using Midjourney/Flux for the persona, running the final video through an automation tool like that makes the 'consistency' part you mentioned a lot less painful.\n\nCurious, have you seen any specific niches in the hyperlocal newsletters (#2) that are scaling faster than others?

There are mechanisms to basically rent all these things individually or as a group and collect rent/passive income.  \n\n\nAnother term for passive income is rent.  Even when you put money into 4% bank account, you are essentially renting money to the bank (so they can lend it out to bottowers at higher rate)\n\n\nEverything else is essentially a job.  Sometimes you can work to create an asset that can get passive income in the future.  You can build a house with your hands, you can create a copyright song, you can create and patent a toy/device.  You created an asset and now you can rent it out. ",

          "body": "One of the most boring but reliable paths is skill based freelancing that eventually turns into repeat clients. It is not passive at first, but once you build a few steady clients or retainers, it becomes predictable monthly income. The unsexy part is doing outreach and starting conversations. I have helped many freelancers land their first clients using a simple outreach based method, and once they had 3 to 5 steady clients, income became much more stable.\n\nDigital products are another boring but steady model. Simple templates, planners, niche guides, or industry specific resources created once and sold repeatedly on platforms like Gumroad or Etsy. It usually takes a few months of testing and improving, but once one product gains traction, it can quietly generate monthly sales without much maintenance.\n\nNiche websites also fall into this category. Writing helpful articles around specific problems, monetized with affiliate links or ads, is slow at the beginning. For the first several months, it can feel like nothing is happening. But once content ranks and traffic compounds, it can turn into steady revenue. It is not glamorous, and it requires patience.\n\nPrint on demand is similar. Upload designs, test niches, optimize listings. Most designs will not sell much. But a few that connect with a niche audience can produce consistent monthly sales over time. It is repetitive work, not exciting work.\n\nDividends and index funds are probably the most boring of all. They require capital and time, and the returns look small at the beginning. But they are predictable and compound over the long term.\n\nThe pattern across all of these is the same. None of them are fast. Most take 3 to 12 months before they feel meaningful. What makes them work is choosing one, building systems around it, and sticking with it long enough for compounding to kick in.\n\nThe most unsexy income streams are usually the ones built on consistency and simple repeatable processes rather than viral wins.\n\nI’ve been breaking down these strategies step by step in my newsletter, you can find the link in my bio if you are interested.",

It helps them think, move forward, and make better decisions based on real-world data.\n\nI’ve learned many lessons on my journey and I thought I'd share a few tips based on what worked for me.\n\nI hope this will be helpful for those of you who want to get into building apps or side projects yourself.\n\n1. validate your idea before you start building.\n2. just because someone else has done it, doesn’t mean you can’t compete. execution is so important and you have no idea how well they’re doing it.\n3. solve your own problem and let this decide if you’re b2b or b2c. both come with pros and cons. don’t listen to people who try to paint a black/white picture of it.\n4. don’t chase investors. focus on getting users instead and investors will come knocking on your door.\n5. getting your first paying customers is the hardest part by far. do things that don’t scale to get them.\n6. keep your product free at the start. controversial opinion maybe, but it’s how i did it and it got me feedback and testimonials that helped me grow fast and make a lot of money later on.\n7. building a good product comes down to thinking about what your users want.\n8. inspiration is the design key when you’re new. don’t build your own landing page from scratch, copy different sections from the tools you love the most and make it your own this way.\n9. post online daily. x, reddit, linkedin, tiktok, whatever suits you and your target audience.\n10. i’m bootstrapped and therefore highly recommend it. work a 9-5 until you have 1-2 years of runway (living cheap), then go all in.\n11. you earn the right to paid ads by getting organic marketing to work first. ads aren’t $100 in, X customers out. you’ll burn thousands just trying to learn it.\n12. define your most important metrics and track them. they should be the pillars that guide all your decisions.\n13. if you’re not passionate about what you’re building, it’s going to be difficult to keep going through the early stage where you might not see results for months.\n14. the first few minutes of your app is a promise to the user: this app will help you achieve your goal. so put a lot of effort into the beginning to convert more people.\n15. have an mvp mindset with everything you do. get the minimal version out asap then use feedback to improve it.\n16. having a co-founder that matches your ambition is the single greatest advantage for success.\n17. good testimonials will increase the perceived value of your product.\n18. always refund people that want a refund.\n19. marketing is constant experimentation to learn what works. speed up the process by drawing inspiration from what works for similar products.\n20. don’t be cheap when you hire an accountant, you’ll save time and money by spending more.",

Especially validating first, getting first customers in non scalable ways, and focusing on organic before paid ads. A lot of people skip those steps and then wonder why nothing converts.\n\nI also agree with the MVP mindset. Shipping fast and improving from real feedback beats polishing in isolation every time.\n\nCurious, what was the biggest growth lever that moved you from small revenue to $12k months?",

No camera, no showing my face, no editing skills needed. AI tools handle most of the work scripts, voiceovers, images, even full video generation.\n\nHow it works:\n\n\\- Pick a niche (scary stories, motivation, finance tips, history facts all work well)\n\n\\- Use AI to generate videos daily\n\n\\- Post consistently for 2-3 months\n\n\\- YouTube monetizes at 1K subs + 4K watch hours\n\n\\- TikTok has the creativity program\n\nIs it truly passive? Not at the start. The first 2-3 months are a grind of posting daily. But once you're monetized and have a library of 100+ videos, they keep earning views and ad revenue without you touching them. That's when it starts feeling passive.\n\nWhat it's not: a get rich quick scheme. Most people quit after 2 weeks of zero views. The ones who make it just didn't stop.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone wants specifics about niches or the process.",

      "selftext": "I’m a 52 year old woman who lost a really good paying job after the COVID epidemic and although I now have stable employment, financially Im drowning. \n\nDoor-dashing was a good way to supplement my income for a while.  But last week I was in a wreck and my car is totaled.   Cant get a car without a down payment.  Struggling to even buy groceries. \n\nI really need a way to make income that won’t involve me quitting my day job (the benefits are excellent).\n\nI have a small amount of SQL coding skills, advanced Excel, and some other general office skill.   Please know that I am open to anything; customer service, freelance writing… anything legitimate. \n\nAlso, after Wed I won’t have a computer as I’m selling the one I have. So I’m hoping to find something legitimate working from my phone until I can replace the one I’m selling. \n\nI am truly grateful for any information you guys are willing to share.  This is like my last resort.  I’m tired of feeling helpless and need to do something that can get me out of a financial nightmare.\n\nPlease. 🥹",

In 2026, you can manage many data tasks directly from a smartphone using mobile versions of Google Sheets, Excel, or even basic SQL editors.\n\n**Immediate Phone-Based Steps:**\n\n* **Virtual Data Assistant:** Use the Upwork or Freelancer apps to look for 'Data Cleanup' or 'Excel Spreadsheet' tasks. Many small businesses just need someone to organize their CSV exports or write a few complex formulas—tasks you can handle on a mobile browser or app.\n* **Microtasking for Data:** Check out **Clickworker** or **Amazon Mechanical Turk**. They have data labeling and categorization tasks that require the logic you already have from SQL. It’s not a full salary, but it can help with groceries immediately.\n* **Content Automation:** Since you understand data structures, you could set up a 'Data-Driven' faceless channel using a tool like **Keyvello**. It has templates that can turn simple data facts (like financial or health stats) into videos in minutes. It’s 100% phone-friendly and can build that passive foundation you’re looking for.\n\nFocus on the freelance apps first to get that immediate cash flow. Your SQL background puts you way ahead of most people looking for remote work. Hang in there.",

Nearly all of my sales came from friends, neighbors and people I personally told. The store had customers but no matter how much I changed the prices or the pictures strangers weren't purchasing.\n\nThen I started searching like a customer like newborn winter outfits or best baby clothes brands. My brand did not show up. Thats when I realized people simply couldn’t find my store.\n\nWhat I actually did:\n\n* Updated product descriptions using language that customers really use to find\n* Added basic FAQs parents usually worry about (sizing, fabric comfort and washing)\n* Wrote simple guides to help first-time parents choose outfits\n* reorganized the categories to make the website easier to use.\n* I focused on the appropriate descriptions and instructions by using a tool to determine which places and search terms were bringing attention to my products.\n\nThese days the store consistently generates monthly sales and I probably put in two to three hours a week to maintain it. Although its not enough to quit your job it feels at last somewhat passive than before\n\nAnyone here started something new this year or next year? What worked for you? Share your experiences\n\n",

How much \"slop\" tolerance do you have?   \n    \nThe other thing I'd mention to people interested in starting something like this: The \"rollercoaster\" sucks because on social media you're at the mercy of the platform. It's incredibly frustrating to see your account growing well across all metrics, and then suddenly have your earnings rate plummet for seemingly no reason. Or to have your best earnings week to date, followed by a week of your reach being in freefall. I'm currently in one of these \"wtf is happening?!\" phases right now and it sucks.",

Some offers pay surprisingly well but the problem is most of them aren't worth your time.\n\nYou'll see a game offer paying $15 and think cool, then realize it takes 20+ hours to hit the required level. That's less than a dollar an hour. Meanwhile there's a finance signup right below it paying $40 that takes 10 minutes. (what the experience actually is like lol)\n\nThere's no easy way to tell the good offers from the bad ones without doing a bunch of research on each one individually. So I built a site that does it for you.\n\nIt's called [offeredge.io](https://offeredge.io). Every offer gets run through a scoring algorithm (the \"OE Score,\" 0 to 100) that factors in:\n\n* Payout vs estimated time to complete\n* How difficult the requirements actually are\n* Whether a deposit or purchase is required (and how much relative to the payout)\n* Offer category (game, finance, app signup, etc.)\n\nHigher score = better use of your time. You can sort by score, payout, speed, or difficulty and filter by device, category, effort level, country, etc.\n\n[Scoring system - an algorithm assigns a score to each offer based off difficulty, time, and payout](https://preview.redd.it/gjej52p1zakg1.png?width=1015&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4febb4e873bfd4ef366135d7951e222b0757222a)\n\nSome stuff the algorithm catches that's easy to miss:\n\n* Game offers where the required level sounds easy but actually takes forever, killing the effective hourly rate\n* Offers that need a deposit bigger than what you even get paid\n* Offers that pay a lot on paper but take so long that you'd make more at McDonald's\n\nIt's a completely free resource. But as a fair disclosure, I do make money through affiliate commissions when you start an offer through the site. It doesn't cost you anything extra and your payouts are the same either way... but I do want to be upfront about that out of respect for this community.",

Too many steps. Too much setup. I’d use them for two weeks and then quit. So I built something simpler.\n\nYou can log expenses using text, voice, or photos. It auto-categorizes and splits shared spending automatically. Think WhatsApp-style logging combined with envelope budgeting.\n\nI’ve had almost no marketing budget. Growth has mostly come from organic Reddit posts, some social media content, and early users sharing it with friends.\n\nIn the last 30 days:  \n• 5,000+ installs  \n• $320 in revenue\n\nIt’s not quit-your-job money. But it’s real. Real subscriptions. Real users requesting features and leaving reviews.\n\nThe app offers a free trial if you want to see how it works. Search **Moneko: Shared Expenses AI** on iOS or Google Play. Early lifetime access is $19.99 for now.\n\nAnd if you have feedback, I’d genuinely love to hear it!!",

      "selftext": "So recently I started a newsletter and made $200 in 2 weeks (proof in comments). I plan to take this to $2k/month in revenue by the end of this year. Why it’s gonna take 10 months? I can only afford to give 1-2 hours/week to this project. That is pretty much passive for me.\n\nHere’s a step by step roadmap how you can do it too:\n\n# Step 1: Choose a niche\n\nTypically finance niches pay the best CPM’s. But try to go narrow, think like finance for single moms. You can also choose ai as a niche, it’s kinda exploding rn. Some other niche ideas are: dating niche, health, stock market or go local (that is a different game altogether tho)\n\n# Step 2: Build a brand around it\n\nTypically you do not want to tie your newsletter to yourself. I’m saying this so that you build a saleable asset. Build your newsletter like a media company\n\n# Step 3: Choose an ESP\n\nYou can go for substack (free) or beehiiv. I personally use beehiiv because of its options to customise plus using their in-built ads network, you can monetise from day 1. It’s a big advantage.\n\n# Step 4: Find subscribers\n\nNow you need your first 1000 subscribers. There are various ways to get them. If you want to spend some money you can acquire them using meta ads. This is the most reliable way but can cause sone serious dent in your pocket. There’s also a paid boost option on beehiiv that does kinda similar thing but here other newsletters get you subscribers and you pay them.\n\nThe other way is to get subscribers by creating content around your niche. You can post on X, LinkedIn or even Reddit.\n\nPersonally for me, Reddit has been my main source of subscriber acquisition. I make posts about various side hustles like this exact post and in return people subscribe to my newsletter if they see value in my posts. I have gotten approx 150 new subscribers this way in the last week itself.\n\n# Step 5: Send Issues\n\nNow you need to send newsletter issues. This totally depends upon your niche, how you do it. Thanks to advancements in Ai, it has never been easier to write stuff. I use ai to organise, clean and format my issues. But you still need to prompt very well in order to get best results from ai.\n\nP.S- I am writing this whole post myself without using any AI, so if there are any grammatical errors or any other mistakes, now you know 😉😉\n\n# Step 6: Monetisation\n\nThe most important step of all. Now there are various ways to monetise your newsletter. The first is like I told beehiiv’s internal ads network. Works best when you are a small newsletter and you can not go and find sponsors. I personally use this myself as my newsletter is still at 2k subscribers. I make $15-20 per issue which is not bad seeing I had to send it anyway for free.\n\nWhen you grow past 5k subscribers, you can actually find sponsors and they’ll pay you anywhere from $100-$400 per post.\n\nYou can also launch digital products of your own or can affiliate for someone else.\n\n# Step 7: Auto-pilot mode\n\nNow if you want a small little side hustle that makes you $2k-ish without any work, you can definitely auto-pilot your newsletter with minimal 1-2 hour work per week. But if you want a behemoth media company making $15k-$50k/month, you need to grind for it. I know newsletters making $1M/month too.\n\nHere’s how you automate:\n\nOnce you’ve reached say 5k subscribers, setup a boost on beehiiv for $1.5-$2/subscriber. Spend as much as you’re comfortable with and you’ll get subscribers on autopilot without lifting a finger.\n\nFor issues, you hire either a VA who does the heavy lifting for you or train your ai to do it for you. Both works. Just do the final editing yourself before sending it out.\n\nFor monetisation, use ads or build relationships with your sponsors that keep on backing you. Again this is doable.\n\nThat’s pretty much the whole roadmap. You need to invest some time upfront to build this whole enterprise but once it’s set up, you run it on autopilot and make $2k/month from this.\n\nWhen I began writing this, I thought I would write a short post but ended up cranking out this long ass post lol. This could’ve been a $19 course in itself lol.\n\nAnyway, that’s it for this post. Any questions ask me in comments.\n\nAlso I will add some images in comments for proofs",

I wrote it, paid a good illustrator off Fiver, found some beta readers, published it on KDP and did some advertising through Amazon and a few relevant blogs. All in all, I spent probably 2k, six months of my time, and haven’t touched it since. KDP handles my soft cover sales and Ingram Spark handles my hardcover (which I make almost no money on).\n\nI sell anywhere from 5-10 books a month regularly. One month, out of nowhere, I sold 48! No idea why. I could definitely sell more if I wrote more books in the series and put some work into it but right now it’s just sitting there until I feel like doing something with it. So far I have not had to talk to a single child (success!).\n\nDid I break even? No idea. Never added anything up. Not passive enough. Probably also can’t answer any questions for you about ROI or whatever. But there it is! Ta da! ",

So $100/month usually means you’re doing ~20k–30k monthly streams across platforms.\nThat’s not luck. That’s catalog math.\n\nA few things you’re doing right whether you realize it or not:\n1. Catalog &gt; hits\n40 tracks means 40 entry points into the algorithm. Every new release feeds the back catalog.\n\n2. Consistency trains the algorithm\nDropping ~2 tracks a month signals activity. On platforms like Apple Music and YouTube Music, steady releases matter more than one big drop.\n\n3. Search-based discovery compounds\nIf even a few tracks rank for mood/genre keywords, those trickle streams stack quietly over time.\nYou’re basically building a royalty snowball.\nIf you want to nudge growth without turning it into a full-time job:\n\nOptimize titles/descriptions for searchable moods (not just creative names)\nRepackage older tracks into themed EPs or playlists\nUpload instrumentals if applicable (double the surface area)\n\nMake simple loop visuals and post to YouTube for extra discovery\nYou’re right though — this is what “normal passive” looks like:\n\nYear 1: Proof of concept\nYear 2–3: Compounding\nYear 4+: Meaningful side income\n\nMost people quit at month 4 when they’re still at $8.\nRespect for sticking it out.

      "selftext": "I have been into ebook writing business for a very long time. Even before people got into Amazon KDP boat. Not many writers were making money from their writing career back then.\n\nI did well in a lot of marketplaces, but something was lacking.\n\nMarketplaces are good. Free traffic. Paid on time. And so on.\n\nBut the real problem is - no emails. Doesn't feel like I was in business.\n\nI wanted control over what I sell and what kind of ebooks I write.\n\nI started with romance writing because it was popular on Amazon KDP. It's still. But with time, I change. From romance, I shifted to other niches that I enjoyed more. Non-fiction and creating templates.\n\n# Marketplaces - The real Problem\n\nI still love marketplaces. I still have my products there.\n\nBut my main issue with marketplaces is -\n\n\\-&gt; No control (formatting, pricing strategy, etc)\n\n\\-&gt; No email capture\n\n\\-&gt; Have to follow their strict rules\n\n\\-&gt; Can be thrown anytime (this is scary)\n\n# What's the better solution?\n\nSell directly. Thats what I am doing right now.\n\nSome good platforms you can use -\n\n\\-&gt; Gumroad (most recommended)\n\n\\-&gt; Patreon\n\n\\-&gt; Payhip\n\n\\-&gt; Lemonsqueezy etc\n\n# How To Start Selling PDFs\n\n**1) Find a niche -**\n\nI mostly stick to one niche. And that's what I recommend the most.\n\n*Sticking to ONE niche means you build authority over time.*\n\nLater on, you can merge more niches. But for the start, you should stick to one so that your audience dont get confused.\n\nSome niches you can try - health, diet, side hustle, passive income, traveling, food, etc\n\nI would recommend going for micro-niche. Because they are easy to dominate.\n\nexample - instead of choosing a health niche, choose - health after pregnancy, keto diet, paleo diet, etc.\n\nGo deeper for your niche.\n\n**2) Find a traffic source**\n\nI mostly choose writing platforms (Reddit, X, threads, etc.). You choose the platform as per your interest.\n\nIf you like Video making, then -&gt; YouTube, Instagram\n\nFor static images - Instagram, Pinterest\n\nFor writing - Reddit, X, Threads\n\n*Choose what format you love spending time on.*\n\n**3) Create contents**\n\nDon't use Ai. I repeat. Do not use AI.\n\nPlatforms dont like it at all!\n\nThe audience can see it.\n\n*So create content yourself.*\n\nDont worry if you dont know what to create. See what your competitors are creating.\n\nFollow a few creators in your niche. Then see what type of content they are creating currently.\n\nCopy the format. And create something new.\n\n**4) Make ONE product -**\n\nDo this after you have some followers. My target is always the first 1000 followers.\n\nThen *make only ONE product.* It can be any. Depends on your audience. Use it as a test product.\n\nPrice range should be - $7 to $25\n\nDont go beyond this. because it's really hard to sell with a small audience.\n\nYou can improve the product and increase the price later.  \n**5) Capture emails -**\n\nEmails are necessary. This was the reason why I left marketplaces. I was not allowed to link my newsletter there. So collect emails. Use platforms that allow you to send emails.\n\n*You can use this to send high-ticket products later*.  \n**6) Expand to other platforms -**\n\nNow, after being on a platform for a very long time, I have often seen that there comes a time when we need to go beyond it.\n\nI see Instagram and TikTok going on YouTube.\n\nBloggers are using Pinterest and Reddit to expand their reach, and so on.\n\nThis way you get more eyes on your content.\n\n# Why small digital products work better?\n\nYou consider any digital product -\n\n\\-&gt; Templates\n\n\\-&gt; ebooks\n\n\\-&gt; audiobooks\n\n\\-&gt; Videos\n\nWhen you are starting out, you first need to validate the product. If a particular product is working well for others doesn't mean it will work for you as well.\n\nSo in order to find what my audience need I always come up with smaller ones.\n\nAnd if I see people are leaving good feedback, I improve and increase the price for it.\n\nPlus, they are actually very easy to sell.\n\n# My Tech Stack For Digital Product Business\n\nI always thought that starting an online business means I need atleats $1000 in my pocket. But with the digital product business, I was wrong.\n\nI always recommend first earning and only then investing. And still follow the same strategy.\n\nThis is what my current stack looks like -\n\nFor **writing** \\-&gt; Google Docs -&gt; $0\n\nFor **formatting** \\-&gt; Calibre -&gt; $0\n\nFor **traffic** \\-&gt; Social media -&gt; $0 (no ads for the past 10 years! You read it right!)\n\nFor **selling products** \\- Gumroad/Patreon (I also have Payhip and Lemonsqueezy, but for new niches I started a few months ago)\n\nFor **emails** \\- Gumroad/Patreon -&gt; $0\n\n# Some advice to a newbie in the Digital Product Business\n\n1. Every niche is profitable. So pick what you personally love\n2. Reach first $1000 is very hard. So be patient\n3. Once sales come in consistently, dont go lazy (I did that and lost a lot of sales!)\n4. Ask when needed. Reddit is the best platform so far. You have aproblem? Simply ask!\n\nI think I have covered enough here. If you still question comment and, I'll try my best to answer them.\n\nGood luck!",

Id say youve got a couple of options to make decent money. \n\n1. Learn a skill and sell your services like building websites, managing ads, or writing in a niche\n\n2. Sell products on your own website like unique moroccan products or make stuff and sell it like candles or ceramics, could also be digital products like templates. \n\nId recommend staying away from marketplaces like etsy they are also saturated and expensive to sell. Best options is to sell something a service or product to people directly through your own website or in person. \n\nYou could export moroccan products in bulk for example.

I use karat for that since the APY is solid and it keeps everything separated without fees, but I know people who use Mercury or Relay too.\n\nIf you’re making money consistently, even if it’s not life changing yet, that’s usually the signal to structure it properly.

Instead of creating new videos, I duplicated my own content into another language using new narration, localized titles and descriptions, and a completely separate channel. The channel is not in English, and it was clearly presented as an official language version of the original.\n\nWhat surprised me was the result. The channel was accepted into the YouTube Partner Program within 2 days, with no reused-content warnings and no appeals. Within the first two days after monetization, it generated $64 — all without filming or editing any new videos.\n\nIf there’s genuine interest, I’m considering documenting the exact process in detail — what actually worked, what YouTube reviewers seemed to care about, and the common mistakes that can get channels rejected. I’m happy to answer questions or clarify anything in the comments.",

      "selftext": "joined this job after moving provinces and desperately needing employment. I have 10 years of experience in Operations and Administration, but unfortunately I couldn’t secure a solid opportunity in my field at the time. So I decided to join Concentrix as a Customer Service Agent.\n\nHonestly, it was one of the worst professional experiences I’ve had.\n\nFrom day one of training, there were constant technical issues. Every single day someone had system problems. Instead of handling the situation calmly and professionally, the trainer would panic and get frustrated. When you’re onboarding new employees, technology should be the first thing properly set up. That never happened.\n\nOn top of that, the trainer’s communication skills were extremely poor. Her English proficiency and training method made it very difficult to understand the material. I’ve worked as a trainer before, so it was especially frustrating to see such low-quality delivery. Whenever someone asked a question, she would laugh and say, “I’m learning along with you guys.” That response raised a serious concern, if you’re still learning, why are you training a whole batch?\n\nOnce we moved to production, things got worse. We were essentially left on our own to handle calls. There were no proper team meetings, no real-time support, and no structured guidance. We were expected to document detailed case summaries in Salesforce while actively handling customer calls. If we needed supervisor approval, we had to message on Salesforce Chatter and wait 10–15 minutes for a response , all while the customer was on hold. We weren’t allowed to answer certain questions without supervisor confirmation. Many customers understandably got frustrated and took it out on us.\n\nAnother issue was the supervisor culture. My supervisor would act supportive during one-on-one calls, speaking as if he was protecting and guiding me. Of course I made minor mistakes in the beginning, it was a new role and a new system. That’s normal. However, I later saw emails where he pointed out every small mistake I made and CC’d multiple managers. It felt performative and political rather than genuinely supportive.\n\nEventually, I was terminated within three months for sharing my supervisor’s work email with a customer and they cited silly reasons that many of your cases were open . Yes Sir they weee open because the issues were not resolved from your team’s side.\n\nYes, I acknowledge that it was a mistake. But I strongly believe this was a failure of training and support. We were not properly prepared for high-escalation situations. There was no structured guidance on handling legal threats, refusals to cooperate, or customers demanding direct escalation.\n\nThe environment lacked proper training, operational readiness, and leadership support. There is much more I could say, but this post is already long.\n\nI would simply urge anyone considering joining to carefully evaluate their options.",

      "selftext": "This is going to sound weird but I need to figure out if there's actually something here or if I just stumbled into the weirdest traffic source that converts at basically nothing.\n\nStarted a site last July about restoring old photographs. Not like a service, just guides and tutorials. How to fix water damage, remove scratches, colorize black and white photos, that kind of stuff. Basic affiliate setup linking to Photoshop alternatives and scanning equipment.\n\nFirst three months nothing happened. Maybe 200 visitors total. Spent the first month targeting stuff like \"best photo editing software\" and ranking on page 7 behind every tech blog that's ever existed. Gave up on that pretty quick.\n\nAround November I started writing these posts about specific types of damage. Like \"how to restore photos with mold damage\" or \"fix photos stuck to glass frames.\" More specific, less competition. Traffic started coming in. Hit about 1,100 visitors a day by December.\n\nThen something strange happened in January.\n\nI wrote this post about restoring Victorian era photographs because I had some examples from my girlfriend's grandmother's attic. Included a bunch of photos from the 1880s and 1890s. Put the names in the image alt text because I thought that's what you're supposed to do for accessibility or whatever.\n\nPost ranked fine. Nothing special. Then I started noticing weird searches in Search Console.\n\nTook me almost a week to figure out what was happening. I kept seeing traffic for \"Margaret Whitmore 1887\" and \"James Whitmore obituary\" and \"Whitmore family tree.\" Thought maybe there was some historical figure I'd never heard of. Googled them. Nothing. Just random dead people whose photos I'd used as examples.\n\nPeople were googling their dead relatives and finding my post because I had used their names in the image descriptions.\n\nNow about 40% of my traffic is people searching for specific names of people who died between 1850 and 1920. I'm ranking for hundreds of dead people's names. Sometimes I'm position 2 or 3 above actual genealogy sites. My top keyword used to be \"remove scratches from photos.\" Now it's \"James Whitmore 1889 obituary.\" I don't even have an obituary on my site.\n\nTraffic is up to 2,800 visitors a day. But my conversion rate tanked. Went from 3.1% in December to 1.4% now. Because people aren't looking for photo restoration services, they're looking for information about their great great grandfather.\n\nRevenue is basically the same as December even though traffic doubled. Made $1,840 in December, made $1,920 in January. Affiliate clicks are down. Time on page is up from 2 minutes to almost 6 minutes but nobody's buying anything.\n\nI get emails now. Maybe 10-15 a week. People asking if I have more information about their relatives. Asking if I know where the photos came from. One person offered me $200 for a high resolution scan of a photo that was in my post. I didn't even own the photo, it was from my girlfriend's family.\n\nOne person asked if I could \"sense\" anything about their great grandmother because I had her photo on my site. Like if I could feel her presence or something. They weren't joking. Offered me $50 to \"connect\" with her. I'm a blogger, not a medium.\n\nMy girlfriend's mom found the post in January and called at 11pm. I could hear her through the phone from across the room. Something about disrespecting the dead and exploiting family history. These people died in 1883. I don't think they care about my blog. Took the photos down anyway. Traffic from those specific names dropped immediately.\n\nStarted testing this with other posts. Wrote about restoring Civil War era photos, used names from Union soldier records that are public domain. Same thing happened. Now I'm ranking for like 30 soldiers' names. Getting emails from people asking about their great great great grandfather who fought in Virginia.\n\nI have no information to give these people. I just used the photos as examples. But they keep emailing.\n\nTried monetizing this differently in February. Added a section to those posts saying \"looking for more information about your ancestor? Try [Ancestry.com](http://Ancestry.com)\" with an affiliate link. Conversion rate went up to 2.1%. Made $2,340 so far this month.\n\nBut the emails are getting more intense. Someone asked if I could help them find their grandfather's grave. Someone else asked if I had any letters or documents. One person accused me of stealing photos from their family and said they'd report me to I don't even know what. The internet police? The photos are from the Library of Congress.\n\nAll the photos I use now are public domain or from my girlfriend's family with permission. But people don't care. They see a photo of someone with their last name from 1890 and assume I have some connection to their family history.\n\nI'm spending maybe 6 hours a week just responding to emails telling people I don't have any additional information. Another 10 hours writing new posts. So I'm spending 16 hours a week total, making $2,300 a month. That's like $35 an hour before taxes. I could literally make more doing photo editing gigs on Fiverr and not deal with angry emails about dead people.\n\nAlso my girlfriend wants me to stop using any photos that could be traced to real people. Which I get. But that's literally the entire traffic source now. If I switch to generic stock photos or illustrations the traffic will die.\n\nTried writing posts about photo restoration without using specific names. Just \"Victorian era photo restoration techniques\" with example images labeled \"Unknown woman circa 1885.\" Those posts get maybe 50 visitors a month. Nobody searches for that.\n\nThe traffic only comes when I use real names of real dead people.\n\nI looked into this and apparently it's legal because they've been dead for over 100 years and everything's public domain. But legal doesn't mean it feels right. I'm basically using dead people for SEO.\n\nSome of the emails are actually nice though. People thanking me for preserving the photos. People saying they've been searching for images of their ancestor for years. One person said my post was the only photo they'd ever seen of their great grandmother. That made me feel less terrible about the whole thing.\n\nBut I can't scale this. I can't hire someone to respond to emails about dead people's family histories. I can't outsource writing posts about specific individuals because you need to actually research them to write anything meaningful.\n\nAnd I don't want to research them. I just wanted to write about photo restoration.\n\nTraffic is growing. I'm at 3,100 visitors a day now. Revenue is growing slowly. Yesterday I ranked number 1 for someone's name and got an email from their living grandson asking if I was related to them. No dude. I just have a photo of your dead grandpa on my blog.\n\nBut I'm stuck in this weird niche where I'm accidentally running a genealogy resource site when I was trying to run an affiliate site about photo editing software.\n\nI don't know if I should lean into this or try to pivot back to the original plan. Leaning in means more emails, more research, more dealing with people's emotional family stuff. Pivoting back means losing most of my traffic.\n\nAlso tried adding a FAQ to those posts saying \"I don't have additional information about individuals in these photos.\" Doesn't help. People email anyway.\n\nThe restoration work itself is easy. Photoshop for most of it. Tried making some before and after comparison videos with APOB for a few posts back in December but nobody watched them so I stopped. That's not really the problem anyway.\n\nThe problem is I built something I didn't mean to build and now I don't know what to do with it.\n\nAnyone else end up ranking for something completely random? Do you follow the traffic or just start over?",

It makes sense for people to contact you about them, as you wrote down the person's exact name. Many of these people are older, retired and desperate for any lead so they don't often check FAQ's/notices and are more likely to contact you.\n\nIt is messed up for you to publish photos of their family members without permission from your girlfriend's mom, even if deceased. If my kid's partner went through my personal files and family photos to post online and make profit from, I'd be horrified. Especially  if the photos you're using are of people's direct relatives, like *grandparents*. If the images were found from other places like the library of congress, include the link to that in the description and note that's where you got the photos from.\n\nI've thought about making similar websites compiling photos and documents of distant ancestors I find online, but it is a lot of work and you have to love managing it for the hobby.",

It would be hard for you to confirm that you are indeed related to the emailer or that the recipient is related to the person in the photo. That'd be the area of genealogical research. Not your niche.\n\nOne option for you to consider: a general page with examples and links to more resources. Add a link to an email address that they can contact you at... but use an autoresponder for that email address. One that points to the resources on the page and add a couple juicy ones that make it seem that the page isn't just a copy. And add a link at the bottom for purchasing a retouched image. \n\nLastly, is there any particular reason you HAVE to reply? Other than courtesy? Could you add an AI bot to screen emailers? Or just reply with the excuse: \"I'm sorry but due to sheer volume of email, I'm currently unable to reply to requests for more personal  information.\" \n\nAre emails part of your funnel for earnings? If not, add several layers to the form. If so, redesign your funnel. This is a manageable problem, and may be a clue to a more profitable niche further down the line.

This way people are sure to see it. Maybe it will stop a few people from messaging. \n\n2) Create basic bounce-back emails or use google gemini to create an automation that identifies people asking for more info and replies. \n\nIf you want to lean into the situation, you can create an index for people. It’s very common in genealogy circles. Just a simple excel list containing the photo/name and people can put a username or contact info down as someone who is researching that person. It helps people connect. I mean, you could make a forum, but that seems like a a lot of work\n\n\nAs a side note, there is this woman called The Phot Angel, and all she does is find old photos at antique stores, thrift shops, etc., research their genealogy, and return them to their descendants.

All the online marketing “coaches”, all of the 1M MRR from 5 clients and etc.\n\nI was sitting on Reddit the other day and read a post about an e-com influencer being caught faking his sales and having an open collaboration with the platform that lets you fake the results. A peanut for a brain basically.\n\nBut I decided to do some research myself since I had too much free time that day, I investigated all of the brez scale of the industry, basically the biggest influencers and all of the go-to coaches for digital marketing.\n\nGuess what.\n\nI noticed the same thing, one of the best known “coaches” within the space who constantly flexes his “Yellow Ferrari” (which by now I think is rented) forgot to remove a “,” when faking his stripe numbers. You can connect the dots yourself on who it is.\n\nI thought to myself this couldn’t be real, I sent the video to multiple friends, they all saw the same thing.\n\nMessaged the guy, asked to join his course, the usual. Then once the call link got sent, I sent him the screenshot.\n\nHis reply was the same, he said the dashboard wasn’t real but it helped him push out more content. He sent me the platform and a discount code for it as an affiliate partnership reference. The platform is extremely polished and you genuinely couldn’t tell the original from the fake apart if you didn’t make any typo’s. (Yes, I bought the dashboard for research purposes ONLY)\n\nI thought to myself “No shit, they’re all faking it”.\n\nThe internet, especially the digital marketing coaching scene, is full of fakes. There’s even tools helping them do it to lure you into the “get rich quick online” scene.\n\nI’m not saying every coach is fake, but please for the love of God, do your own due-diligence prior to falling to the guy with the rented lambo and the rented penthouse.\n\n  \nQuick Edit; I'm not sure why so many of you are dm'ing me about it. As mentioned in my initial post I do not condone this type of behaviour and if you're looking for the name you can check my initial post.",

Each gap includes: why it exists, potential impact, content type recommendation\n\nExample output I got for my own site:\n\nInstead of writing \"Best Dog Food 2024\" (saturated), it suggested:\n- \"How to transition your dog to organic food without digestive issues\" (HIGH impact - barely covered)\n- \"Organic dog food for senior dogs with kidney disease\" (MEDIUM - specific pain point)\n- \"Price comparison: organic vs conventional dog food over 10 years\" (HIGH - unique angle)\n\nThese are ideas I would never have thought of. And they're actually GOOD.\n\nPricing:\n- First analysis free (no email required)\n- £31/month unlimited after that\n\nCannot add the link to the website here due to the rules.\n\nI'm using it for my own sites and it's already saved me hours.

No strategy calls, no big presentation, just clean it up and hand it over in a week.

You, as a new agency, probably don't have that street cred yet.  \n\nHowever, a brand refresh that fits the woefully inadequate budgets of the every-company?

Meanwhile I was doing basic spreadsheet consulting on the side to pay bills. The consulting brought in about 3.2x what the SaaS made in the same period. I think there's a pattern here that most founders ignore: the boring stuff works because people already understand the value. You don't have to educate the market or convince anyone they need it. They know they need it, they just want someone reliable to do it. The real question is whether you can find a way to scale the boring thing without it eating your soul. I ended up productizing the consulting into templates and a small course, which brought the revenue up without trading more hours. Still not as exciting as the SaaS but my bank account doesn't care about exciting",

Listen to it. Your \"vision\" offer can be the upsell for people who come in through the boring one.

Practice self-care. Entrepreneurship requires every bit of you. Every single day. (And most nights.) Exercise. Eat well. Meditate. Rest. The basics. But you have to do them better, than most other people, just to keep moving forward. Do not underestimate this. \n\nP.S. I did spend a few years working for other companies.

But the businesses that actually scaled were the ones where I stepped back and asked \"how can I make this repeatable without me?\"\n\nDocumenting processes felt like a waste of time when I was busy. But once I had systems in place, I could delegate, I could take a real vacation, and honestly the business ran better without me micromanaging every detail.\n\nThe other thing I'd add: Get comfortable with saying no. Every opportunity looks good when you're hungry. But chasing every shiny object dilutes your focus and burns your energy. Learning to say \"that's interesting but it's not aligned with where I'm going\" was a game changer.\n\nCurious what your thoughts are on delegation vs doing it yourself.

Like that person posting about 10k MRR probably had 3 months of $200 total revenue but conveniently forgot to mention that part\n\n  \nI started tracking my own small wins instead - first email subscriber, first dollar earned, first person who actually used the thing without me begging them to try it. Made the whole journey feel way less lonely and gave me something real to focus on instead of other people's highlight reels\n\n  \nIt's definitely part of the process though, that mental game is probably harder than the actual building sometimes 💀",

Nobody posts \"day 47, still zero paying users, ate cereal for dinner.\"\n\nSomething that helped me reframe it: those people posting 10k MRR didn't get there by scrolling Reddit and comparing themselves to other people posting 10k MRR. They got there by closing the app and doing one uncomfortable thing per day. One cold email, one user interview, one feature shipped.\n\nAlso worth remembering that \"first few paying users\" is genuinely the hardest milestone in any business. Going from 0 to 1 is harder than going from 100 to 1000. If you can get strangers to pay you money for something you built, you're already ahead of most people who just talk about starting something.",

I spend time in finance and investing subs answering questions about SEC filings, quant basics, and market structure. I do not pitch. I just help. People end up checking your profile, see what you’re building, and reach out on their own.\n\nThe ROI beats paid channels for one reason. You build trust and content at the same time.

Gamma and Canva get mentioned a lot for a reason, you can dump your content in and they handle most of the layout so you’re not fighting fonts for 3 hours.  \n  \nAnother angle that actually works well for sales stuff (especially insurance where you’re basically walking people through info step-by-step) is turning your material into a flipbook style presentation with Flipsnack. You upload your PDF or content and it turns into something you can scroll through like a digital brochure, track views, share with clients after the call, etc. Feels more like sending them a polished proposal than “here’s my slide deck”.  \n  \nA lot of people I know mix tools now. Build visuals fast in Canva, export, then present/share in something more interactive. Way less design stress than starting from a blank PowerPoint.",

To power the platform, our backend scrapes Upwork job posts on a minute-by-minute basis. Because of this, I happen to have a database of 3.2M+ jobs just sitting on my server, showing exactly what problems businesses are actively spending money to solve right now.\n\nDrop your SaaS idea, niche, or target audience below. I will pick the right keywords, query the database, and reply with the real numbers.\n\n(Side note: if you want to run your own queries or download the raw data, I made the dataset available directly on the UpHunt website).\n\nLet's see what the market says. Drop your ideas below 👇\n\nHere is the format I will use to reply (Example for a LinkedIn tool):\n\n=== SAMPLE RESPONSE ===\n\n    Keywords Searched: [\"linkedin automation\", \"linkedin outreach\", \"automate linkedin\"]\n    Total Demand: 0.1989% of all jobs (6467 clients)\n    Average Hourly Rate: $19/hr\n    Average Fixed Budget: $1051\n\n[](/submit/?source_id=t3_1ra8v93)",

You can have the best product, but if you don’t have a solid plan for marketing, customer service, and operations, it can all fall flat.   \n  \nThere's also this notion that you'll quickly rake in profits, but many businesses take years to become stable. It's more about persistence and adaptability than instant success. Surrounding yourself with the right resources, like a good mentoring network, can really help navigate those tough early stages.  \n",

The only real edge college might give you is network and exposure. Not lectures. Not exams. The rooms and the people.\n\nIf you feel your worldview is limited, attack that directly. Put yourself around founders doing bigger numbers. Attend events. Join paid communities. Work with higher level clients. Travel while still running your business. You do not need a campus to expand your thinking. And those travel build programs can be interesting, but only if they genuinely raise your standards and connect you with serious operators. Otherwise it’s just a nice experience that delays scaling what already works.\n\nIf the agency is growing steadily, I’d push it aggressively for the next 2 to 3 years before pausing momentum.

You're doing neither. You already named your actual gap: no network beyond clients, no exposure beyond your niche, limited worldview. That's a more honest self-assessment than most people twice your age ever make.\n\nHere's what I'd sit with. The question isn't \"college or no college.\" It's \"what kind of growth do I need right now?\" You've proven you can execute. You can build, sell, deliver. That's real and you should be proud of it. But execution without perspective narrows over time. You get better and better at the thing you already know, and your world gets smaller while your revenue gets bigger. That's a trap disguised as progress.\n\nCollege, at its best, isn't about learning business theory. It's about being forced to think across disciplines you would never choose on your own. Philosophy, history, psychology, ethics. The stuff that doesn't feel useful until ten years later when you're making decisions that require more than tactical skill. It broadens the foundation you build everything else on.\n\nThat said, a traditional four-year degree isn't the only way to get that. Those travel programs you mentioned sound closer to what you actually need: real exposure, real building, real worldview expansion. The test for any option isn't \"will this give me a credential.\" It's \"will this make me think differently about what I'm already doing.\"\n\nYou don't need a backup plan. You need a wider lens. How you get it matters less than whether you're honest about needing it. And at 19, the fact that you already see that puts you ahead of where most people start",

You can always take online classes to work towards a degree if they becomes necessary, and some colleges will give you credits for your business experience to shorten the time and classes required.\n\nYou can always sell your business to cash out and take time off to get a degree if you wish, but I think you will want to see how far you can go with your agency over the coming 5+ years as who knows how far it can grow.\n\nOnce you do get to a level of financial success you can travel the world however you wish. Also, look into organizations like Rotary, Kiwanis, or some other local groups where business owners meet. I travelled to conferences held for owners and principals in the business I owned, and it was great to connect and network with others doing what I as doing, so look for those opportunities. \n\nOne tip is to start putting money away early and save as much as you can. This will help give you breathing room if the business can't be sold or goes through a downturn. ",

And the mom of the lead singer girl made her go to college,  first, and then revisit her music career. They *never* got back to where they were before she dropped it to go to college. \n\nI think my point is, if you're building, and it is still in the early stages, see if you can get that degree now. And go for one that actually helps you with your business/niche. \nIf you've done a lot of building, and it has (starter to) really take off, don't just drop your business.  \n\nAnd there's lots of space between 'dropping the business and going 100% for the degree' and 'focusing 100% in your business and NOT getting a degree at all'.",

Meanwhile demand for recovered materials - copper, gold, rare earth metals - is only going up as supply chains tighten.\n\nThe business case is real. But what makes it interesting from an entrepreneurship standpoint is the structure of the market.\n\nTo operate legitimately and land corporate clients, you need R2v3 or e-Stewards certification. These are industry standards that verify your downstream - meaning you can prove where materials actually end up. Most large corporations now require this from their recycling vendors.\n\nThat certification requirement acts as a real moat. It keeps casual competitors out. But it also means the barrier to entry is higher than just buying equipment and opening a warehouse.\n\nThe compliance side is genuinely complex - documentation, audits, downstream vendor diligence, ongoing reporting. Most people looking to enter the space underestimate this part completely.\n\nThe entrepreneurs I've seen succeed in this space treat compliance as a competitive advantage rather than a cost. Once you're certified with MG Environmental Consulting, you're in a much smaller pool competing for enterprise contracts.\n\nCurious if anyone here has explored this space or knows people in it.",

Most recycling programs are bullshit but some of them are okay. \n\nBattery recycling is something that makes sense and the only reason is because it’s profitable at a certain scale and efficiency. \n\n1st Problem is feedstock. It’s a “reverse distribution, logistics” kinda business. Where are you going to collect the batteries? How many kg/ton per location? How many locations? How many trucks needed? Depending on your location, are you charging a disposal fee? Are you collecting for free? Or are you paying the disposer a rebate? \n\nNext problem is Capex and know how. Processing plants are not cheap, and you need to get licensing and approval from govt agencies etc. And then there’s the know how. Nobody who’s figured it out will actually teach you the best and efficient way to extract the maximum amount of black mass from your feedstock. It requires a lot of R&amp;D and by R&amp;D I mean trial and error. So it’s actually a business with a very high barrier to entry IMO. It cannot be bootstrapped.

They were applying for certification back in the early days of the industry, and it was the guy that wrote the standard they were trying to certify against that came in to do the audit. He took one look at the software, and said we should sell it to other companies - it's exactly what was needed in the industry.\n\nSo I did. Re-wrote it as a SaaS and worked with a few other ITADs to get feedback, then launched about 10 years ago.\n\nOne thing everyone seems to be missing in the replies here - e-waste can be a little misleading. Here in the UK we tend to use the term ITAD (IT Asset Disposition). The main focus is NOT on destroying PCs, but rather on refurbishing them for onward sale. Just because a large enterprise customer has decided to replace the machines, it doesnt mean they are dead. Erasing the hard disks and re-selling the machines is big business.\n\nAnd with sustainability being a key thing here in the UK and Europe, proper reporting on this can be a massive boost to ITADs.",

Right now your landing page exists to tell a story, build trust, handle objections, and nudge someone toward a purchase. But when an agent is doing the shopping, none of that matters. It's just parsing your structured data, comparing you against 50 competitors in seconds, and making a decision based on price, availability, and whatever criteria the human set. All that conversion optimization work becomes invisible to a huge chunk of your traffic. I think we're going to see businesses basically running two parallel experiences whether they realize it or not. The human-facing one with all the emotional triggers and brand storytelling, and the agent-facing one that competes purely on data quality, response speed, and how cleanly you expose your catalog. The interesting thing is that the agent channel actually rewards transparency and punishes the kind of pricing games and dark patterns that work on humans. If your competitor's API returns clean structured pricing and yours requires three clicks and a popup to reveal the real number, the agent just skips you entirely.",

What problem does it solve? Who is it for? Why would someone actually use it? If you can explain it simply, you’re on the right track.\n\nNext, sketch it out. Just use pen and paper. Draw what the first screen looks like. Then the next screen. Think about what the user taps, what happens after that, and how they finish using it. This helps you see gaps before spending money.\n\nAfter that, cut your idea down to the basics. What is the smallest version of this app that still works? Focus only on the core features. Everything else can come later.\n\nSince you don’t code, you can either:\n\n* Try a no-code tool and build a rough version yourself, or\n* Hire a freelancer once you clearly know what you want built.\n\nThe biggest mistake people make is paying someone before they’ve fully thought it through.\n\nTake a week to plan properly.

One detail that made a bigger difference than I expected was matching the tone and structure to what the customer expects at that stage-sometimes abandoning the fancy layouts in favor of what feels like a real message from a person, especially for re-engagement. Adjusting things like send times (which can be tedious to test) and preview text length had subtle but noticeable impacts on open rates for me. Something I noticed when working through email sequences with PWD is how powerful small personalization cues were-like referencing something specific they interacted with previously. Even adding a single sentence at the start that’s unique to their signup path boosted clicks well beyond general segmentation. It’s easy to get caught up in templates, but those little human touches ended up moving the needle more than any big design change.",

The real driver is distribution, skill, positioning and patience, and most people skip that part completely.\n\nWhat actually kills people is chasing trends instead of building leverage. They copy a YouTube tutorial, throw up a logo, run a few ads or cold DMs, then quit when it doesn’t generate cash in 30 days. The opportunity was never the problem. The lack of depth was. Every business model works for someone who understands marketing, psychology and long term thinking.\n\nWhat’s consistently profitable is boring and slow. Building an audience. Developing real sales ability. Creating something genuinely useful. Sticking with one path for 2 to 3 years instead of restarting every few weeks. The method matters far less than the operator and their consistency.\n\nI’ve been documenting building income the unsexy way while working a normal job in London and trying to grow things properly instead of chasing hype.

          "body": "Honestly, AI agencies are probably the most overhyped business model right now. Everyone sees the potential and thinks they can slap together a ChatGPT integration with some Zapier automations, charge $2k a month, and call it a day.\n\nBut here's the reality  most small businesses genuinely don't need that level of complexity. They need customers, not dashboards. And the space has gotten so crowded that standing out is harder than ever, especially when clients are getting smarter and starting to ask the uncomfortable question: where's my actual return?\n\nThe problem is that a lot of these services are selling the tool rather than the outcome. AI is powerful, sure, but power doesn't equal value if it's solving a problem the client doesn't really have.\n\nWhat's actually working? Honestly, the boring stuff nobody wants to talk about. Local lead generation still prints money when you do it right. Niche services where the ROI is obvious and measurable not theoretical hold up way better under scrutiny. And building an audience before you try to monetize anything remains one of the most underrated advantages you can have.\n\nNone of it sounds as sexy as \"AI automation agency.\" But it works, and it keeps working long after the hype cycle moves on.",

Not complicated business logic.. but the paperwork was eating them alive.\n\nEvery Friday, their accountant would sit down and manually match purchase orders to supplier invoices to delivery receipts. Six hours minimum. Sometimes she’d find mismatches from three weeks ago and have to chase them down by scrolling through WhatsApp groups.\n\nWe built an automation that pulls invoices from email, extracts the line items, matches them against existing purchase orders in their system, and flags anything that doesn’t line up. Runs every morning at 7am before anyone’s in the office.\n\nMonth-end close went from 5 days to about 1. The accountant told me she actually left work on time for the first time in two years.\n\nTotal build time was about a weekend. The business was already using an ERP for inventory, so we had clean data to work with.. that’s honestly what made it fast. If their data had been in 14 different spreadsheets it would’ve been a different story.\n\nBiggest lesson: the automation itself wasn’t the hard part. Getting the data organized first was.\nAnyone else automating the boring back office stuff? Curious what’s working for others.",

Wednesday morning my office manager texted about a vendor invoice that didn't match the PO and she didn't know who approved the original order. That was me. I approved it verbally and never documented it.\n\n Turns out I am the process for about half the things that happen in my shop. Not because my team is bad but because I never wrote anything down. It all lives in my head. Now I am spending the next 6 months documenting every process I touch.

That's a method for discovering where the cracks are.  You could leave but tell anyone that they could call you any time.  Then document what they call you about, and approach it from that perspective.\n\nI also think that people reach out to you because they know they can.  If you didn't answer the phone about that pricing question, then what would have happened?  Idk, but something.  Eventually they'd had said, well FormerFounder-12 would probably increase the price by 10% so lets do that.\n\nabout the vendor payment if i was you employee and couldn't get ahold of you, I would reach out to the contact at the vendor and just explain the situation.  They would say FormerFounder approved the change.  Or i might just wait, if i pay a week late that probably not a big deal.  But if i can get a hold of you, then obviously that's my easiest path to solve the problem.\n\nI think a big part of it is how you treat people when they make mistakes.  If i can't get ahold of you, then i have to make a judgment call.  What happens to me if you think i made a bad call?  If i get fired or disciplined, people will learn real quick to never make judgement calls.

Most owners never actually test this because they're afraid of what they'll find.\n\nThe pattern you described is incredibly common. The business doesn't have processes, it has you. Every verbal approval, every pricing decision made on the fly, every vendor relationship that lives in your head, those are all single points of failure wearing a human disguise.\n\nThe good news is that you caught it deliberately instead of finding out the hard way through a health scare or burnout. And the fact that your team called you instead of just guessing means they're actually responsible. They just don't have the information they need to make decisions independently.\n\nOne thing I'd suggest as you document: don't try to write a procedure for everything at once. Start with the decisions that interrupted your five days. Those are your highest-frequency bottlenecks. For each one, write down the decision criteria, not just the steps. Your team probably knows what to do mechanically. What they're missing is knowing when to do what, and what the boundaries are for making the call themselves versus escalating.\n\nThe pricing adjustment one is a perfect example. Your supervisor probably knows how to price a change. What he doesn't know is how much authority he has to adjust without your sign-off. Define that threshold and half your interruptions disappear overnight.",

My advice? If you are running into the issues of employees not being able to handle it; Hire a No. 2.

I'd also say you need to consider what's an art and what's a science (that is, what's something you just have a feel for that you maybe need someone else to understand... and then what's a repeatable methodology which lends itself way better to being a documented process).   For those \"arts\", you may need to consider if there is a way to convert it to a science for documentation purposes.\n\n&gt; Not because I am selling tomorrow\n\nThat said... if you think selling is a realistic thing in the near future, you could probably get yourself a lucrative \"consulting\" position post-sale.

Not the install-and-forget kind — the recurring service agreements where you inspect systems twice a year and get first-call priority when something breaks.\n\nI work with a lot of trades businesses and the ones printing money aren't chasing big installs. They're the ones sitting on 200-400 maintenance contracts at 15-25/month each. That's 3,000-10,000/month in recurring revenue before a single service call. And maintenance customers convert to equipment replacements at 3-4x the rate of cold leads because you're already their guy when the compressor dies in August.\n\nThe boring part is that it takes 2-3 years to build a meaningful book of contracts. But once you're there, you've essentially built a subscription business with physical lock-in — nobody cancels their AC maintenance in Houston in July. And every house on that route is a potential referral for the neighbor's unit that's making a weird noise.\n\nThe businesses I've seen do this best treat the maintenance visit like a sales call without ever selling anything. The tech checks everything, takes a photo of any wear, and says 'your capacitor is at about 70% — it'll probably last another season but I'd plan on replacing it next spring.' No pressure, just information. The close rate on those follow-ups is insane.",

      "selftext": "I am a 29 year old COO for our family business. We are in the logistics side of wine and spirits transportation. My dad started the company about 30 years ago and built a very successful business over time.\n\nI joined about 6 years ago doing order entry and eventually took on my first real project building and testing a new proprietary operating system, which we rolled out at the beginning of 2023. About a year and a half ago we were having some operational challenges and I asked my dad to trust me and give me control over operations. With his blessing, we made some major changes and have seen significant improvements in processes and customer feedback.\n\nWe are not perfect and still figuring things out, but for the first time in our history we are measuring success and failure, clarifying roles, getting the right people in the right seats, and trying to drive efficiency. We have also made big improvements in company culture, which is something I’m really proud of.\n\nWhile operations are moving in the right direction, we are really struggling on the financial side.\n\nWe have about 65 employees. My dad has always been more of a “fly by the seat of your pants” operator and never really built strong financial systems or used data to drive decisions.\n\nFrom 2015–2019 (before I joined), the business was doing extremely well. He was buying equipment, growing sales, and making a lot of money. During that time he also started purchasing a lot of personal assets through the business.\n\nWhen COVID hit, everything changed. Demand spiked but our operation was strained and we had to move into a new building that was about double the size. In doing so, our rent went from about $29k/month to \\~$100k/month. Around that same time, we lost one of our largest and most profitable customers (a government account that changed their model entirely).\n\nBetween the higher fixed costs, the lost customer, and general chaos from COVID, it was kind of a perfect storm. PPP and other relief programs helped keep us afloat for a couple of years, but since then we’ve been in a slow financial decline.\n\nToday we are doing about $16M in revenue, but only around \\~$200k in net profit (\\~1–1.5% margins).\n\nA quick snapshot of where we are now:\n\n* Revenue: \\~$16M annually (\\~$1.3M/month)\n* Payroll: \\~$400k/month\n* Rent: \\~$100k/month\n* Currently about \\~$300k behind on rent\n* AR: most customers pay within 30 days, but some stretch to 60+ and we have to chase\n* AP: some vendors we keep current, others we’ve stretched to 60–90 days\n\nWe are generally profitable on paper, but consistently cash flow negative due to timing and thin margins.\n\nWe’ve been in a cash flow crunch for about 1.5 years now. My dad has put in personal investment money, taken on multiple short-term loans, and we’ve exhausted a $750k line of credit. At times we’ve had to delay vendor payments just to make payroll.\n\nWe were recently approved for a financing package with TD Bank to consolidate debt. This will actually improve monthly cash flow by about $60k by reducing current debt payments, which helps in the short term. That said, it also feels like it’s just kicking the can down the road because most of the immediate liquidity gets eaten up quickly (for example, covering back rent).\n\nFrom my perspective:\n\n* We grew too fast without proper financial systems\n* Our margins are too thin to absorb delays in cash collection\n* Fixed costs (especially rent) are too high for our current revenue\n* There has been a lack of financial discipline historically, including personal expenses running through the business\n* Operationally we are improving, but financially we are unstable\n\nOn my end, I’ve been focused on what I can control:\n\n* Cutting unprofitable work and lanes\n* Reducing headcount where needed\n* Looking at pricing and rate increases\n* Trying to improve efficiency across the board\n\nI believe we can improve margins over the next few months, but I don’t know if that alone solves the bigger problem.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges is that I don’t have ownership in the business yet, so my leverage is limited. My dad understands how serious things are and is clearly stressed about it, but he has said he is not willing to sell personal assets at this point. His mindset is basically “I’ve never gone backwards in 40 years and I’m not starting now.”\n\nI understand the pride in that, but I also worry about where that leads if things don’t turn.\n\nSo I guess where I’m struggling is this:\n\nIf you were in my position:\n\n* What would you prioritize first: cash flow, cost cutting, or margin improvement?\n* Is this realistically fixable without a major capital injection or asset sales?\n* How would you handle a founder who understands the problem but resists the financial decisions needed to fix it?\n* At what point do you decide to walk away from something you don’t ultimately control?\n\nCandidly, I deal with imposter syndrome every day being 29 in this role without a real mentor, and I’m trying to learn as much as I can, but I’ve never been through something like this and don’t know many people who have.\n\nAppreciate anyone who took the time to read this and respond. Happy to answer any questions that would help add more context.",

          "body": "That is a though situation to be in and I emphasize with your situation.\n\nThe single most important thing you can do right now is start tracking cash on a 13-week rolling basis, and I mean this week, not when things settle down. What you need is a week-by-week map of exactly what cash is coming in, when it lands, what is going out, and on what specific date it leaves. The reason this matters so much is that it completely changes the conversation with your father. Right now you are telling him you are in trouble, which is abstract enough for someone with 40 years of survival instincts to wave away. A document that says \"on March 14th we cannot make payroll\" is not something anyone gets to dismiss.\n\nAfter that, go after your accounts receivable immediately, because customers sitting at 60-plus days are holding your cash in their bank accounts and calling it normal. Find out what the standard payment term is in logistics, call your customers, and start moving toward that number aggressively. Send invoices as work is completed rather than waiting until the end of the month. None of this requires your father's sign-off. It is entirely within your control today, and the cash impact shows up fast.\n\nOn the rent, your landlord already knows you are behind, so there is nothing to gain by avoiding that conversation any longer. A landlord losing a 65-person tenant and sitting on an empty warehouse is in a far worse position than one who cuts a deal with you, and most landlords understand that math better than you might think. Go to them directly, be straight about where things stand, and put something concrete on the table.\n\nThe harder thing is your father and your job is not to convince him of anything. I would not say that his resistance is not irrational stubbornness. When someone builds something from nothing over four decades, \"I have never gone backwards\" stops being a business strategy and becomes an identity. Pushing back on the finances feels to him like an attack on his life's work, which is why every argument you make lands as a threat rather than a solution. What actually moves people like that is not a better argument. It is reality made undeniable. Put the 13-week cash map in front of him without a lecture attached, and let his own judgment do the work.\n\nLast thing, I would privately decide what your line is. Before you are exhausted and running on fumes, define the specific condition that tells you this is no longer recoverable under the current structure. Missing payroll, your father blocking the AR changes, whatever it is for you. The point is that having that threshold decided in advance means you make that call from a clear head rather than from the wreckage of burnout.\n\nThe business may or may not make it through this. The operator you are becoming in the process goes with you either way, and that is worth more than most people realize.",

He was making money so he didn’t pay attention to any of the little things that mattered.  Covid came around and he reacted a couple years too late.  Cutting hours, moving to a smaller space, none of it mattered because it was too little, too late.  It eventually shut down after more than 40 years.  I started over in my bedroom - no employees, no warehouse, I just sub everything out so I don’t have any expenses (nearly anyways) other than cost of goods sold, and that’s all paid for by the customer (duh).  It’s smaller, more streamlined, and I’m making way more money as a result.  \n\nYou might want to think of a way to do something similar in case things go south.\n\nYou guys need to make big changes, quickly.  At the end of the day, you can only make more money by either selling more or spending less and you probably need to do both.  If you can’t cut hours and/or lay off folks without it being detrimental to your output then there’s a pricing issue and you need to figure out how to bump up your margins.\n\nSorry, that’s kind of big picture/vague as opposed to a step by step plan, but wanted to chime in since I just went through the same thing.

Your cash flow is poor because you mention all the other metrics of your business but not your single biggest working capital line… inventory. Is all your cash tied up in inventory? I see this a lot with high end liquor distributors/retailers. The inventory doesn’t turn that fast, so you’re floating about 150 days of inventory, and it’s REALLY hard to manage the bullwhip effect when sales see big spikes up (“let’s buy based on last months sales!”) or to curtail purchases when sales start to slow (“we always order x number of cases every week”).\n\nIf you’re in the transport space, what about insurance? That’s usually a big killer and something you need to consider before setting prices.\n\nIf you’re in the 3PL space, make sure you’re billing appropriately for handling. The in/out and storage charges may not cover all the headaches with abnormal pallet sizes and shitty scheduling behavior.\n\nMake sure you keep an eye on the merchandise. Wine/liquor is a prime product for employee theft.\n\nLastly, at $16 million, you should hire a professional for help with accounting/finance.

This is a pressure cooker situation and I can feel the stress and cash-flow crunch just from reading your post. Three months behind on rent is heavy.\n\nFirst, zoom out and ask the hard questions:\n\nDo you really need a building that costs $100k/month? That’s $1.2M annually.\nDo you really need 65 employees at this stage?\n\nAre there large EIDL or other loan payments squeezing you?\n\nYour own perspective is already pointing toward the answer: this is a financial discipline issue, not an operations issue.\n\nIf personal expenses are flowing through the business, that stops immediately. Pause all unnecessary ACH payments. Fancy cars, discretionary spending, anything non-essential freeze it. Survival mode.\nMargins are critical. $200k of “profit” on paper means nothing if cash flow is negative. Even adding back personal expenses to justify profitability is dangerous thinking. Thin margins + bad timing = cash-flow death spiral.\n\nYou said it yourself: cash flow negative due to timing and thin margins.\n\nSo fix the two levers:\nAccounts Receivable tighten this immediately.\n\nDo not move freight without proper payment terms. Get dated checks, deposits, stronger credit controls.. whatever fits your industry. Speed up collections aggressively.\nPricing raise prices.\n\nSmall percentage increases can dramatically improve cash flow. If you’re paying late, you’re already signaling distress. Protect your margins now, not later.\n\nOn the payables side: prioritize vendors that directly drive revenue. Keep your key suppliers current. You may even negotiate better terms or small discounts for early payment if you stabilize.\n\nI went through something similar in 2021. My mistake was lowering margins in an established business to beat new competitors. It cost me millions in lost revenue. Hard lesson. I rebuilt by restoring pricing discipline and focusing on profitable revenue, not vanity growth.\n\nYou don’t walk away from this. You tighten up. You protect cash. You defend margin. And you make disciplined decisions instead of emotional ones.\n\nYou’re closer to fixing this than you think.",

          "body": "This is a classic \"successful founder vs. scale\" trap. You have inherited the operational mess of a business that outgrew its own back-of-the-envelope math. At $16M in revenue with 65 employees, you are no longer a \"family business\"—you are a medium-sized enterprise running on a small-business brain.\n\nFirst, breathe. You aren't an imposter; you are a COO doing a turnaround in a high-interest-rate environment. That is the hardest version of this job.\nHere is how to look at this professionally and clinically.\n\n\n**1. The Financial Reality Check**\n\nYour margins ($200k profit on $16M revenue) are 1.25%. In logistics, that is a rounding error. One bad accident, one lost client, or one diesel spike wipes you out.\n\n * The Rent Problem: You are paying $1.2M a year on $16M revenue. That’s 7.5% of gross revenue just for the roof. For a logistics company, that is dangerously high, especially when you are $300k (3 months) behind.\n * The \"Personal Assets\" Conflict: Your dad is treating the business as a personal piggy bank while it's on life support. This is the \"Founder’s Paradox\": he feels he earned the lifestyle, but the business can no longer subsidize it.\n\n\n**2. What to Prioritize First?**\n\nIn a turnaround, there is only one god: Cash Flow. \n\n1.  Stop the Bleed (Immediate): The TD Bank consolidation is a bandage, not a cure. Use that $60k/month savings specifically to escrow for rent and payroll. Do not let it vanish into \"operations.\"\n\n2.  Aggressive AR Collection: You cannot afford to be a bank for your customers. If they are at 60+ days, they need to be on credit hold or moved to ACH/Pre-payment. A 1% margin business cannot afford to wait 60 days for money.\n\n3.  Variable-ize Costs: If your rent is fixed and high, your labor and equipment must be lean.\n\n4.  The \"Losing Money\" Audit: You mentioned cutting unprofitable lanes. Do more of this. It is better to be a $12M company with 5% margins than a $16M company with 1% margins.\n\n\n**3. How to Handle the Founder (Your Dad)**\n\nYou need to move the conversation from emotions to math.\n\n * The \"Hard Deck\" Presentation: Sit him down with a 13-week cash flow forecast. Show him exactly when the bank balance hits zero. Don't argue about \"going backward\"; show him the \"cliff.\"\n * The \"Church and State\" Separation: The personal expenses running through the business are likely tanking your ability to get better financing or a higher valuation. Tell him: \"Dad, I want to protect your legacy, but the bank sees these personal draws as a risk. We need to clean the books to save the company.\"\n * The Ownership Conversation: You are 29, carrying the stress of a $16M company, with 0% equity. You are currently an underpaid consultant for his retirement plan. You need a path to ownership (vesting) tied to hitting specific financial milestones.\n\n\n**4. Is This Fixable?**\n\nYes, but it requires \"Surgery,\" not \"Physical Therapy.\"\n\n * Sublet Space: If you doubled your square footage and the rent is killing you, can you sublet 20-30% of the warehouse to another company? That is the fastest way to fix your rent-to-revenue ratio.\n * Rate Increases: If you are the \"logistics side of wine and spirits,\" you are in a specialized niche. You should have pricing power. A 2% across-the-board rate increase flows almost entirely to the bottom line and could double your profit.\n\n\n**5. When to Walk Away?**\n\nYou walk away when the authority doesn't match the responsibility.\nIf you are responsible for the 65 families (employees) but your dad overrides your financial cuts to keep his personal lifestyle subsidized by the company, you are in a \"no-win\" scenario.\nSet a \"Drop Dead\" Date: Give yourself 6 months. If by then:\n\n * Rent isn't current.\n * Personal expenses aren't removed from the P&amp;L.\n * You don't have a signed equity/succession agreement.\n\n   ...then you should leave. You have \"COO of a $16M company\" on your resume now. You are highly employable elsewhere without the family baggage.",

It sounds like there are hidden or overlooked expenses that haven’t been fully identified.\n\nInstead of focusing only on cutting costs, you should consider more strategic sourcing. Can you negotiate long-term supplier contracts to reduce purchasing costs and stabilize your operating expenses?\n\nYou should also evaluate your pricing and payment terms. Is it possible to extend supplier payments from 30 to 60+ days to improve cash flow and keep more liquidity on hand?\n\nOn the revenue side, you may need to be more aggressive in finding stronger customers and diversifying your client base. A more strategic deployment of your product into better market segments could significantly improve performance.\nYou should also assess how much debt the business can responsibly take on to strengthen logistics and delivery. Strategic investment in infrastructure might position you better long term.\n\nRather than cutting costs just for the sake of cutting costs, you should focus on optimizing the structure of the business , bundling services, forming better supplier partnerships, improving sourcing capabilities, and tightening accounts payable management....

          "body": "First off, take a deep breath. You are 29 years old, managing a $16M company, making payroll for 65 families, and executing an operational turnaround in a notoriously difficult industry (logistics). \n\n**Your imposter syndrome is lying to you.** You are doing the work of a seasoned executive. The fact that you recognize the root causes of the financial distress means you have exactly the right instincts.\n\nWhat you are experiencing is a classic family business transition crisis: a visionary, high-risk founder who relied on gut instinct colliding with a mature, high-overhead company that requires rigorous, data-driven management.\n\n**1. What to prioritize first: Cash Flow, Cost Cutting, or Margin?**\n\n**Cash flow is absolute priority #1.**  \nYou can survive for years on bad margins, but you will die on Friday if you can't make payroll.\n\nCost-cutting and margin improvement are the *methods* to achieve cash flow, but your immediate focus must be liquidity. The TD Bank consolidation is a lifeline, but as you noted, it will be eaten up quickly.\n\n* **Implement a 13-Week Cash Flow Forecast:** If you don't have one, build one immediately (there are templates online). This projects every dollar coming in and going out for the next quarter. It shifts you from *reacting* to the cash crunch to *anticipating* it.\n* **Attack Accounts Receivable (AR):** In logistics, you are essentially acting as an interest-free bank for your customers when they pay at 60+ days. You need to get aggressive. Implement strict credit limits, require deposits for newer/riskier clients, and offer small discounts (e.g., 2% Net 10) to get cash in the door faster.\n* **Cost-Cutting is #1a:** You mentioned cutting unprofitable lanes and headcount. Keep going. Every dollar of fixed cost you cut goes straight to the bottom line and improves cash flow immediately!\n\n\n\n**2. Is this fixable without a major capital injection or asset sales?**\n\n**Mathematically: Yes. Realistically: Only if your dad's behavior changes.**\n\nLet's look at the math: You are doing $1.3M/month in revenue.\n\n* Payroll is $400k (30% of revenue)\n* Rent is $100k (7.6% of revenue)\n* That leaves roughly $800k/month for COGS (fuel, insurance, maintenance, debt service, etc.).\n\nA 1-1.5% margin is razor-thin, but the TD Bank restructuring saving you $60k/month is massive. That equates to $720k a year in free cash flow, which practically quadruples your net profit *if* you hold the line on expenses.\n\n**The Elephant in the Room:** You mentioned your dad runs personal expenses through the business. **This must stop immediately!!!** It is a leaky bucket. You cannot out-operate a founder who is draining liquidity for personal lifestyle maintenance. Commingling funds when a business is distressed is also a massive legal and tax liability!!!\n\n**3. How to handle a founder who resists the financial decisions?**\n\nYour dad’s identity is tied up in this business. When he says, \"I've never gone backwards,\" it’s ego and fear talking. He is terrified of failing after 30 years, and his coping mechanism is denial.\n\nYou cannot win emotional arguments with him; you must use objective data.\n\n* **Change the framing:** Don't frame this as \"You made bad decisions.\" Frame it as, \"The COVID expansion, the rent increase, and the lost client completely changed the math of our business. The old playbook won't work for this new reality.\" Give him an honorable way to accept the current state.\n* **Draw a hard line on personal expenses:** You need to sit down with him, show him the 13-week cash flow, and say: *\"Dad, we are $300k behind on rent. The business cannot act as a personal bank account anymore. If we don't separate your personal expenses from the operating account, this company will fold within X months, and you will lose everything anyway.\"*\n\n**Put him on a strict salary/draw:** Figure out what he *NEEDS* to live, make it a fixed payroll line item, and cut up his company credit cards used for personal assets!!!\n\n\n\n**4. At what point do you walk away?**\n\nThis is the toughest question, especially because it's family. You do not have equity, which means you are carrying all the stress of a founder with the financial upside of an employee.\n\nYou should walk away if you hit these specific tripwires:\n\n1. **He refuses to stop personal spending:** If you secure the TD loan and he continues to drain cash for personal assets, you are managing a sinking ship. Leave!\n2. **He overrides your operational control:** If you fire an under-performer or cut an unprofitable lane, and he reverses your decision based on \"gut feeling\" or sentimentality, your authority is dead!\n3. **He refuses to document a succession/equity plan:** You are 29. You cannot spend the most vital wealth-building decade of your life saving a company you don't own. Tell him: *\"I will lead us through this restructuring. I will get us back to 5-10% margins. But in exchange, we need to map out an equity vest or phantom stock plan for me within the next 90 days.\"* If he refuses, you are just an underpaid consultant.\n\n**Your Game Plan for Monday Morning:**\n\n1. **Protect the TD Bank Lifeline:** That $60k/mo savings is your one shot to stabilize. Map out exactly how that extra cash will be deployed to pay down the $300k back rent and get vendors back to 30-day terms.\n2. **Lock down the cash:** Approve every outgoing wire and check yourself!!!\n3. **Have the hard conversation:** Show your dad the exact numbers. Explain that selling personal assets now is a choice; if he waits until bankruptcy, selling personal assets could be mandated by a court!\n\nYou are doing the right things. Now you just need to force the financial discipline to match your operational discipline. Stay strong.",

Cost cutting leads to margin and cash flow improvement. The important part is to find the unproductive costs.\n\n- Is this realistically fixable without a major capital injection or asset sales?\nAnswer: This is a tough question to answer as there is not enough information. I think a better approach would be to identify the idle assets and figure out how to utilize them better. Example, the rent is high and unless you can change that, is the space underutilized? Can part of it be rent to someone else? Can the idle space be used to create value in a different way?\n\n- How would you handle a founder who understands the problem but resists the financial decisions needed to fix it?\nAnswer: Show the trajectory over the next 5-10 years.

Like x% off if paid within 7 days? Maybe send out a notice that you had a consultant come in and change up the billing software so it now flags accounts that are overdue and in jeopardy of automatically being sent to collections past a certain overdue timeframe?",

It was **standardizing the 3 things that are making you crazy**:\n\n\n**1. How customers reach you**\nPick ONE channel. I chose text for scheduling, phone for emergencies only. Post it everywhere: \"Text [number] to book.\"\n\n\n**2. Your booking ritual**\nEvery time someone texts, same reply: \"Got it. [Day] [Time window]. Address: _____. Cost: $____. Confirm?\"\nCopy/paste. Takes 30 seconds. No decisions.\n\n\n**3. The calendar block**\nDon't just put \"dump run\" on your calendar. Block \"Drive + load + landfill\" as one chunk. I learned that 3 \"quick jobs\" = 4 hours, not 90 minutes.\n\n\nAt 3-4 jobs/day, you don't need enterprise software. You need 3 repeatable steps so your brain stops juggling.\n\n\nWhen you hit 8-10 jobs/day, *then* look at tools. Right now, standardization will buy you 2 hours/day and stop the double-bookings.\n\n\nHow many days a week are you running currently?",

That person calling you right now is already dialing the next hauler on Google by the time you see the missed call.\n\nTwo things that fix this without adding overhead:\n\n1. Auto text-back on missed calls. Most business phone apps handle this - OpenPhone, Google Voice, even some carrier features. Someone calls, you can not answer, they get an instant text: \"Hey, on a job right now. What do you need hauled and what is your zip?\" Now they are in a conversation with you instead of moving on to your competitor.\n\n2. Stop quoting live over the phone. Send everyone a standard message: \"Shoot me a photo of what needs hauled and your address, I will get you a price within the hour.\" Batch your quoting into 15 minutes at the end of each work block instead of getting pulled out of work constantly.\n\nThe operators I have watched go from one trailer to three did not get there by working harder. They got there by making sure every lead that came in actually converted to a booked job. Right now you are probably losing 40-50% of people who reach out - not because they said no to your price, but because they called someone who picked up.",

Might help with the bigger picture of scaling this thing beyond just you and a trailer. For right now though, get a calendar system locked down.\n\nGoogle Calendar with reminders every 30 minutes before a job would've saved you that landfill trip.

No scattered WhatsApp threads and phone notes.\n\nStep two: time blocks, not “whenever I can.” Decide your available pickup windows in advance and only offer those. For example, 6–7pm, 7–8pm, Saturday 9–11am, etc. If a slot is full, it’s full. That alone will prevent stacking jobs.\n\nStep three: use a basic scheduling tool or even a shared calendar. Every job gets:  \nClient name  \nAddress  \nDump type  \nLandfill plan  \nPayment status\n\nNo job exists unless it’s on the calendar.\n\nStep four: buffer time. If landfill closes at 5, your last dump run should target 3:30 or 4. You need margin. Side hustle mistakes usually come from overestimating how much fits in a day.\n\nFinally, consider raising prices slightly. When demand exceeds capacity, price is the lever.

That 10 seconds per pickup is the difference between spotting patterns and just watching chaos happen. Second, as calls start coming in when you're fully booked, resist the urge to take every job. Instead, track which times and days you're getting crushed with inbound calls. That's where your actual demand ceiling is, and it tells you exactly when you need to either raise prices, adjust availability, or make a real hiring decision.\n\n\n\nThird, once you have 30 days of clean data in CurbWaste, run a quick analysis on your actual profit per job versus the time it takes. You might find that three of those four daily jobs are actually worth it, and one isn't. That's the insight that keeps a side hustle from becoming a burnout machine.",

You might consider that plan B or plan C.\n\n&gt;Sold within days\n\n&gt;Just to keep a few listings active at a time\n\nwhenever you are selling out of inventory too quickly, the solution is higher prices.  If you are finding 1 or 2 items a week and selling 1 or 2 items a day, then increase your prices.  Raise your prices by 5x and see what happens.  Like don't raise them just a little and continue to have the same problem.  Raise them to the point where they are too expensive.  If you never find what price is too expensive, then it'll be hard to find the sweet spot.\n\n&gt;So for people selling vintage on vinted or similar platforms who've actually figured this out what's your sourcing situation look like? Trying to grow this thing without completely abandoning what made it worth doing in the first place.\n\nyou might have to think about the degree to which this is a for profit enterprise versus a fun hobby that produces a little extra money.  There is no need to grow a fun hobby and if you do it might stop being fun.\n\nIf you get into restorations, that could increase the volume of stock you can find.

The brand strategist in me would go as far as saying have a strategy and a brand doc ready for these outlets, so that you get to guide the conversation - but that obviously depends on your budget and how much you're willing to put into getting it right. However if you're going to invest somewhere, I definitely suggest investing in the truth instead of a lie.",

      "selftext": "i run a small local food and walking tour in NY . started this a couple years ago after quitting my office job thinking it would give me freedom and steady income. first season was actually decent. good reviews, some repeat guests, and word of mouth started to build.\n\nnow it feels like everything is falling apart.\n\nbookings come in through random resellers or direct messages. people pay a small deposit and then disappear. last month alone i had 15 no shows. full groups of 6 to 8 people who were supposed to come, guides prepared, food pre ordered… and nobody shows up.\n\nchasing the remaining payment is exhausting. some guests just ghost completely. one guy booked for a group of 10, showed up with only 2 people, then demanded a huge discount because others couldn’t make it. i refunded part of it just to avoid a scene, but it basically wiped out my whole day’s profit.\n\non top of that, the big booking platforms take massive commissions, sometimes 20–30%, and fake or unreliable bookings still slip through. i’m losing thousands, can’t refill empty spots last minute, and still have to pay guides who kept their schedules open.\n\ni’ve tried raising deposits, sending multiple confirmations, even doing video calls for larger groups. the problem keeps happening. it honestly feels like the system is stacked against small independent tour operators.\n\nmentally it’s draining. i’m barely sleeping and constantly stressed about the next cancellation. part of me wants to quit, part of me wants to fix it and make this work.\n\nhas anyone running tours or experiences dealt with this? how do you get real bookings that actually show up without losing money to no-shows and platform fees?",

I used to have the problem of people not showing up, canceling last minute,  asking for a discount upon arrival or after the lesson...and this when I had to organize gear and instructors to have it all ready in the morning, including pick up.\n\nGot tired, and asked to full payment upfront.\n\nThat was it. It has not happened again, and the only 2 times since that it has happened has been because... I made an exception and allowed them to pay upon arrival because it was a last minute booking. Never again.\n\nRefunds can only happen if the cancellation is done at least 48 hours in advance, and for a legit reason. Otherwise it's at most a partial refund.\n\nI don't use 3rd party platforms either. Got my own website, integrated payment via Paypal (makes people feel safe- Stripe was a pain in the %$$ and am not using it again), made it rank and also use Google ads to stay at the top. This should save you money as well.\n\nFinally, regarding the reviews, I suppose the fake reviews are on Google. If you haven't set up an account on Tripadvisor and ask for reviews there. I'm sure you'll get good ones, and can put a badged in your website from TA that shows the good rankings. With time you can also ask for the review on Google.\n\n\n\nHope this helps!  ",

We run a mix of free and paid events in LA. There’s still a solid 15-20% no show even with payment.\n\nFree events have been totally cooked — we used to do a lot of community events/meetups where RSVP usually gave us a good indication of how many would show up. It used to be 50%, then 20%, now sometimes I can have as many as 100 “rsvp” and only 3 come through. It’s an end of an era, it seems. The Meetup platform totally tanked going through the pandemic, Eventbrite is being sold off—- I think the social fabric is very, very different now from what it was pre-pandemic. \n\nI think it’s the phones, the economy, people are exhausted and burnt out.

You gotta make the booking fee atleast $50, this gives them more pressure to show up, cause theor money is on the table.

Now I’m the one who needs help.\n\nI own a small business that I started and fully funded myself. I own 100% of it. I do everything — the work, bookkeeping, taxes, invoicing, customer relations — all of it. and I've been in business for over 2 years\n\nWhen I first started, things were manageable. I paid for materials, tools, and consumables in cash. No loans, no credit cards, no investors, no debt. It felt safe and controlled.\n\nBut as the months went on, the business kept growing. Bigger clients came in. I moved into B2B work with net 30 terms. At first, I was balancing that with smaller cash-paying jobs, which helped with flow.\n\nNow I’m almost strictly B2B. Dee to me not having any physical time for the smaller intricate jobs that takes 6 hours to complete.\n\nAnd my cash flow is terrible.\n\nOn paper, I’m growing every month. I have recurring clients. Work keeps increasing. But because of net 30 terms, I’m constantly waiting to get paid while needing to buy materials for the next round of jobs. I’ve gotten to the point where I’m worried I won’t be able to afford next month’s materials — even though I have the work lined up.\n\nI’ve tried loans which i cant get approved due to my credit and being high risk and grants, but most “grant” programs I find just want fees to “move my application forward,” which feels sketchy. I don’t want to bury myself in bad debt.\n\nThis situation has stressed me to the point of mental exhaustion. I’ve honestly thought about shutting everything down just to relieve the pressure — even though I know the business is growing and has real potential. It feels like I’m growing too fast and I can’t keep up financially.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with rapid growth creating cash flow problems like this?\n\nHow do you manage net 30 clients without constantly feeling underwater?\n\nI don’t want to quit. I just don’t know how to stabilize this.\n\nAny advice would mean a lot.",

          "body": "I have been exactly here. What you were dealing with is very normal, and when entrepreneurs are able to navigate this successfully, it’s the difference between a successful company and one that goes bankrupt \n\nNet profitability usually is not what kills a business, usually it is cash flow.\n\nI’ll start by saying, Don’t listen to the people that say “don’t accept net 30 terms”. Those people don’t understand the world and industry that you deal with. Unfortunately, in certain industries, the client sets the terms. We are playing in their world. We can decide to play with them, but that’s simply the way it is. Everything has pros and cons. The benefit to these commercial clients is that they are higher volume, higher value jobs. And usually less time spent/higher margins. The con is that they’re usually net 30+.\n\nSo yes, you can decide to not accept net 30 terms, but now you’re working with a different business model. I’m going to assume you excel in this field and have carved a niche, it is a TOTALLY acceptable business model. \n\nIn 2025, we were 48% commercial and 52% residential. Residential has its headaches, but we still show it a lot of attention and are constantly going after residential jobs, because it’s quick cash. This is what makes payroll. This is what keeps cash in the account when our account receivable is 150 K. Without it, inevitably, we would come to a place where we are borrowing high interest debt to make payroll. That’s not what we want to do.\n\nIf residential simply isn’t an option for you, and there’s absolutely no way for you to get any money down on maybe larger projects on the commercial side, you have to be very careful at how fast you “grow”. In a business with a quick cash conversion cycle, this isn’t as much of a problem. \n\n1. I would recommend firstly finding all the ways you can decrease the overall cash conversion cycle. The first thing you can do is look at every single outgoing payment that you make monthly, and find a way to push those payments off so that the money isn’t taken out of your account 30+ days, or as long as possible.\n\nFor example, we put everything on credit cards. We know that cash isn’t due until at least 30 days from the statement close.\n\nWe have negotiated with all vendors to try to push back payments as late as possible. Sometimes it’s possible and sometimes it’s not. But that is always our goal, to push that outgoing cash as late as possible. \n\nBe very, very careful here, this is where financial discipline comes into play. This is where people get into loads of bad debt. You have to know what’s coming in, when it’s coming in, what you can float, Spreadsheets are your best friend. Don’t sleep on this part, it is VERY important. When this first started to become an issue this bought us almost 30 days for a/r to improve before we had to make those usual payments. It helped us get ahead of the curve and if you haven’t done this yet DO IT. \n\n2. Now you have to figure out how to decrease the cash conversion cycle even more based on income. Is there any possible way to get down payments, can you do more residential, factoring (in extreme case), but you get the idea.\n\n3. Monitor monito monitor monitor. Hire somebody to be in charge of your account receivable. This is a full-time job for us. Do absolutely everything you can to stay on these people. In the commercial world, putting liens on things, this is standard practice. They don’t take it personally, all it does is make you become one of the first people that they pay. We send a letter of intense often, and quiet, we are still working with to this day. We’ve never lost a commercial client by sending a letter of intent. All it does is make sure that it gets to the owner.\n\nHit me up sometime if you ever want to discuss this! There are a lot of things that you can do, but you have to be incredibly intentional",

A bank can give you the liquid cash a day or two after you ship (90%, with the other 10% released when your customer pays).

Otherwise if you're not insured and that happens, you immediately owe the bank the unpaid value.

Avoid taking loans or using credit cards for the business until you complete #2 below.\n\n2. Find a professional accountant (this may be difficult during tax season). Ask them to review your books thoroughly. Have them analyze your Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L), Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement. If your balance sheet shows structural issues, your business model may be failing. Numbers do not lie.\n\n3. Review all Net 30 customers carefully. If customers exceed payment terms, your credit control process may be ineffective. Ideally, receivables should not go past due — even by one day.\n\n4. Sit down and evaluate 2–3 projects based on gross profit. Determine whether your margins truly cover the cost of capital. As a basic benchmark, if your profit does not exceed approximately 12%, your net return may not justify the risk. This may sound aggressive, but a business must outperform low-risk financial alternatives(Fix CD/ US Bonds). If you cannot outperform safer investment , your strategy may involve high risk with insufficient return. This is a fundamental business principle.\n\n5. Open a separate business account at the same bank. Transfer net profit into that account every time you receive payment. Do not use those funds until you have completed #2.\n\n6. Do not sign leases or long-term contracts until #2 has been completed.\n\n  \n",

You need to automate the cash flow monitoring and collections process or this will happen again.\n\nHere's what worked for me:\n\n• Automated invoice aging reports every week. Know exactly what's coming in when.\n• Automated payment reminders at 20, 25, and 30 days. Most customers pay faster when reminded professionally.\n• Cash flow projections updated daily. Sounds fancy but it's just a spreadsheet that shows you your expected cash position for the next 60 days.\n\nThe payment terms issue is real. I started offering 2% discount for payment within 10 days, full price for Net 30. About 40% of customers took the early payment discount.\n\nFor immediate relief: pick your best 2-3 customers and ask for one accelerated payment as a favor. Most will do it if you have a good relationship.\n\nLong term: you need a line of credit for exactly this situation. Growing businesses need working capital financing.\n\nWhat industry are you in? Some have specific financing options that work better than traditional bank loans.",

Rapid growth is a good problem to have, but it can definitely feel overwhelming when cash flow doesn’t match the workload.\n\nA few things you might consider:\n\t1.\tBusiness credit or line of credit – Even a small credit line can bridge the gap between invoices and expenses. It gives you breathing room without relying on loans with bad terms.\n\t2.\tOutsource non-core tasks – Bookkeeping, invoicing, or even customer follow-ups can be handled by someone else. That frees you to focus on the work that actually brings in revenue.\n\t3.\tSegment your clients – Keep some smaller, quick-turnaround jobs that pay cash to maintain positive cash flow. Maybe hire someone part-time to handle these jobs, so you can focus on the bigger B2B contracts without sinking into a cash crunch.\n\t4.\tInvoice strategy – I know others already covered this but you can offer small incentives for early payment, or split larger invoices into smaller milestones to reduce the net 30 waiting period. Even partial upfront payment helps cover materials.\n\nHope sone of this helps and wish you the best!",

You made the right decisions for a small business, then scaled past the point where those decisions still work. Cash-based operations + net 30 clients = you need either:\n1. Enough cash reserves to float 30-60 days (you don’t have)\n2. Supplier credit that matches client terms (hard to get as solo operator)\n3. Different client mix that pays faster (but you went B2B for stability)\nThe real question: do you want to scale this, or stabilize it?\nBecause scaling means bringing in a partner or taking debt. Stabilizing means capping revenue at whatever you can self-fund.\nThere’s no “hack” that lets a solo operator grow 20% YoY on net 30 terms without external capital. The math doesn’t work.

You'll probably not make any killer connections unless you're the CEO of a major company looking to land some national deals. This doesn't mean they're not useful though. I find they can be very useful as a form of highly focused industry research. Eg: browsing products on the expo floor, getting a temperature of how the industry is heading, having insightful conversation with someone after a panel, going to panels in general that actually hyper relate to something you'd like to improve in your business, etc. These conferences are way more about information gathering. What are your peers doing? How much are they earning? What are they afraid of? It's all useful information to help you pilot the direction of your business. For us it's also a great source of motivation/inspiration. Nothing like being in the fully immersed in your field around people who are as high level as you to give you the perspective you need to keep your personal motivation high. I'd only do something like this though once every 2-3 years at most, probably even less frequently if I had to put a serious travel budget behind it.\n\n- Small, especially semi-local ones are your best networking opportunities. Here it's much more about conversations with the same crowds over a weekend. Our favorite conference we go to every year is just a small few hundred person affair that involves creatives across several fields from greater region in my state. We've connected with some great people to work with through it and have become a little more \"on the map\" in leading design circles in our area just by showing up. Also because its semi-local it's not a huge cost in time or money to attend, which helps and I know every connection I make is someone I could get coffee with the next week. I'd only go to a non-local small conference if my industry was very small-world and I knew connections I made there could actually impact my business direction.",

If gives you the opening to go back to them for the bigger sale. (It also helps prove out the value of the investment you've made.)\n\n\\- Don't do \"business card in the bowl for a prize\" or the electronic equivalent. All you get are junk contacts that take forever to follow-up (if you bother) and most people say \"just wanted to win the prize\"\n\n\\- If you can have someone with you on the booth do. It means that if there is a serious prospect you can spend time with them and still have the other person \"working the crowd\". Nothing worse than having a hot prospect in a deep discussion and another prospect walks up at the same time and you have no way to capture their interest.\n\n\\- Work on an opening question that sorts those in your market and those out of your market. When they respond to the question be happy in saying \"sorry we can't help you with that\". Gets people out of the stand quickly and stops time wasting.\n\n\\- Go back to every contact after the event with an email and a call. It's not much fun but it's where most of the value lies. So many companies collect contact details and do nothing with them.\n\nGood luck.",

I have had my older kids work for me over the past few years part time but they  have moved on and would add a full or part time for the right person.  I think its inevitable for more financial freedom.",

You seem to be taking the attitude that other businesses only fail because of what they control and as long as you do a good job for your customers they will be there forever.\n\nI think a better approach is steady sustainable growth. Build up reserves, take more for your long term retirement needs. It sounds like you are sacrificing opportunity because you see growth as nerveracking and risky. Growth does not have to be seat of your pants and reckless. It also does not need to be stressfull. Dont be afraid of building your business just be thoughful and manage the risks as you go. More revenue, more people is also not just for you. The people that choose to sell thier time to your  business want to prosper as well. They want raises, opportunity and less stress as well. A thriving business means more for them as well.\n\nMe, had I worked for you and it became apparent you had no ambitions for the business and were actually making sure you didnt grow I would have quit immediately.\n\nYour way and that of the people here is not really a business as much as you have put together a job (with presumably modest retirement or long term objectives ) and you like it and want to keep it that way. Often that works fine but if it fails you have to go back to work for someone else so at least understand that risk.",

No one but you should have the ability to release payments. \n- Post a job and hire a senior technical person who has been in the pressure vessel industry for good 15-20 years.\n- If unable to hire this experienced person full time, bring him on a retainer and learn the trade from him. He could be a consultant and he should be your guy! \n- Get your hands dirty. Learn the trade on the ground. For example, if you get a new order, tell the current team that you will work with them and finish the entire order with you on the line.  Even if it means working alongside the labor because unless you know the product/process inside out, they will/may keep fooling you. \n- Contact the customer that complained about the product. Check with your consultant that you will bring on board on what went sideways and consult your internal technical team as well. It could just be a case of order getting completed but the revenue may be pocketed by someone internally. \n- Investigate the dropped revenue and check with those clients who no longer deal with your company on what went wrong? \n\nTake immediate control before your family/employees eat the company out from the inside. Good luck! ",

          "body": "Hello! What made me stop and read this fully is your age. 21. Most people would just walk away in your situation but you are asking how to take responsibility and that is serious intent which matters.\n\nA quick context for you so you know where I am coming from:  I have worked with multiple agencies and founder-led businesses over the last 15 years. I have seen revenue collapse, family politics, silent mismanagement, and operational chaos up close. I don’t run a fabrication business, but I understand business structure, leadership drift, and how systems break. \n\nI would address your post as follows: \n\nFirstly, separate emotions from structure. Right now you have 4 parallel problems (as per your post):\n\n1. Technical knowledge gap\n\n2. Operational breakdown\n\n3. Financial opacity\n\n4. Family power dynamics\n\nIf you try to solve it all at once, you will end up drowning. \n\nHere is what your first 90 days should look like:\n\nMonth 1: Observe, don’t react: Sit inside operations daily. Shop floor. Client calls. Vendor calls.\n\nAsk dumb questions. Take notes.\n\nGet access to full financials; last 24 months. Cash flow, receivables, payables. Everything related to money coming in and going out. \n\nList all active orders and their status. Do not assume anything. Note it only if it exists on paper. \n\nYour only focus in Month 1: understand the business reality.\n\nMonth 2: Audit quietly\n\nCheck: Why did revenue fall from 7 to 2? Lost clients? Pricing? Delays? Quality issues?\n\nSpeak to 3–5 old clients directly. Ask what changed.\n\nCheck production rejection rate and complaint logs.\n\nMap who actually makes decisions today. On paper and in reality.\n\n\nIf you suspect mismanagement, you need data to validate it and not confrontation.\n\nMonth 3: Take controlled authority\n\nDefine weekly production targets.\n\nImplement a simple reporting rhythm (daily output, order status, cash position).\n\nSeparate relatives from roles. No one is “family” in a production meeting. Only role and output matter.\n\n\nNow about workers older than you: you do not earn authority through volume. You earn it through clarity.\n\nDon’t say “I think.”\nSay: “This is the plan for this week. Here’s what we are tracking.” Calm. Measured. Structured. Consistent.\n\nOn technical learning: You do not need to become the best welder. You need enough knowledge to not be fooled.\n\nStart with: Basic pressure vessel fundamentals\n\n1. ASME codes overview\n\n2. Welding process basics\n\n3. Quality inspection checklist\n\n4. Visit competitors quietly if possible\n\nSpend 60–90 mins daily learning for 6 months. This compounding matters. Most importantly, control cash first. Every rupee. A traditional business dies from cash suffocation before ego issues.\n\nAnd one hard truth: If your cousin is mismanaging, this will become political. So build numbers as proof before you build arguments.\n\nI don't think you are unprepared, you are just early to the game. If you want, you can reach out directly. I am not an industry expert in fabrication, but I can help you think through structure, authority, and 90-day execution without emotion. All the best!",

When my dad passed way in a car accident, and our small business was a completely different industry of high volume/low margins, I had two brothers who could go back home and spend months getting everything in place. All of us spent many many hours in our youth working in the business, so even if we had been away for 5-15 years, we had familiarity and knew people. \n\nOne brother had been accepted to a PhD program and had 6 months until it starts and was just working ac lab job he could easily quit. \n\nAnother brother had an mbA and was working for a big-5 consulting firm but had been told he wasn’t on track to make partner. He had 12 months to find other work and they let him have up to a month off to go take care of the family business. \n\nBut also different from yours, the business finances were in shambles and none of us knew (not even my mom). \n\nI guess the reason I tell this story even though different is that these first months are critical.

Instead of fighting them lean on their experience - they've been doing this for longer than you have - even the person in the lowest rung. Bring them into your fold rather looking at it like you have to manage them. Once they have your trust, it is by default that they answer you to as you own the company.",

You might be able to have A.I. figure out ways to at least give you some solid overviews. I'm a big believer in when I want to learn anything, I need to start focusing on the most basic, elementary elements before trying to say \"remember random things\".\n\nI view that like a tree analogy. You want to understand some of the roots, then the main part of the tree, eventually get to the branches, and finally get to the leaves. People get overwhelmed when they start with random leaves...   This is just about that business as a whole. Next piece would be simply being in and around the business and just absorbing what's going on. I also would probably have AI research a bunch of competitors and try to figure out what they are doing that's working well. If you have any documented SOPs, I certainly would be putting those into AI for analysis.\n\nThere's a lot more on the human side, like the distrust of the cousin and perhaps the element that your time is split between serious study and this business dilemma. If you actually have a controlling interest in this business, then I would think the three things you may want are either to learn it and run it yourself successfully, or to get more experienced management to come help turn it around and increase the value of it. Build water! Then either way, possibly set it up to sell. Right now, you don't want to set it up to sell if you're 65% down in revenue with problems.

It sounds like your father was the glue that kept the entire operation running and your sales will go to zero soon if no one else knows what’s going on.  A lot of small businesses go this direction unfortunately.  You may need to figure out how much runway you have - what are your costs / month. What are your employee wages / month. Then how much money is currently in the bank and how much do you have currently invoiced?  You may have a few months left before you run out of money and employees can no longer be paid. \n\nIf you insist on running it yourself you need to understand what gaps now exist in the business now that your father is no longer here. What specific business-critical roles/responsibilities belonged to him? which can be transferred to current employees, and which can be transferred to you, if you can learn them?. The rest may need to be hired out to a new employee. \n\nIt helps to create a value stream map of the entire business operation from quotation to product delivery. It can be a tedious process but can help you got a real handle on the workflow and identifying technical gaps. You may find that your dad was responsible for some technical/compliance related thing (like an engineering stamp?) that the entire business hinges on and also requires education/training/certification that will be impossible to replace from within.",

If revenue drops because of poor quality, so should the salary drop/firing happen. Burtal but this is how you get control in any business. Never hesitate to fire or give pay cuts to people if productivity or revenue is going low. Give a paycut on long breaks/poor output, and you will be surprised by the magic.   \n2. a) Customer is KING. Meet them, understand the issue, and understand what the problem is. Talk to the person/team in your company who manages it. If there is no one fill the gap. If there is someone already, then find the issue; either they need to be fired or schooled properly.   \n2. b) Also, if you are in a concentrated business where a few customers dictate a lot of revenue, and there is no other face right now, you will also need to step up or get a face. Impressions matter a lot many times, and you will have to see and decide. Don't be a person they can't trust. Don't promise what you don't know. It's better to speak less than wrong.   \n3. Have the right mix of patience + speed. Very important, don't let emotions make you hasty decisions. If you see someone even cheating on you, maybe even a cousin, the first step would be still play a friend and just migrate all important information from them to someone you trust or yourself, and then take actions againts them. Still, you need to have speed else world is too competitive, and someone else will eat your lunch. Competitors are always on the lookout for your weak spots. Same for the positive side, don't be overjoyous on large orders, have patience, scale with patience.   \n4. Find a mentor whom you can trust and who has seen at least 5x or more scale of your current business. Both points are equally important. This should not be the immediate priority, but definitely in the long run. But don't trust anyone blindly. \n\nMade a lot of mistakes in my early 20s, these are just to help. ",

Custom proposals are a filtering failure, not a sales tool. If someone needs a 40-page custom scope to decide whether to work with you, they're either price shopping across five vendors (and your proposal is free consulting for whoever wins) or they don't actually know what they want yet -- in which case you're doing discovery work for free.\n\nThe tiered pricing PDF works because it does two things at once. It qualifies the lead (if someone sees your pricing and ghosts, they were never going to close anyway) and it anchors the conversation around your packages instead of their wish list.\n\nThe paid discovery phase is the part more people should steal. I've seen contractors do this really effectively -- charge $250-500 for an on-site assessment before quoting anything custom. It filters out tire-kickers immediately because anyone willing to pay for discovery is serious. And you've already started the relationship before the real proposal lands, which dramatically increases close rates.\n\nOne thing I'd add: track your close rate before and after this change. Most people who make this switch see their close rate go up even though they're quoting fewer people. That's the signal that you were wasting time on unqualified leads before.",

          "body": "The no-referrals piece is the most important signal in your entire post. At $320k recurring with solid retention, your existing customers should be generating word-of-mouth on their own. If they're not, it usually means one of two things: they can't explain what you do in one sentence to a friend, or they don't feel different enough after using your product to bring it up.\n\nBefore you hire or add channels, talk to your top 20 customers this week. Not a survey — actual conversations. Ask them: when someone asks you how you handle [problem you solve], what do you say? If they fumble the answer, your positioning is the bottleneck, not your distribution.\n\nThe other pattern worth flagging: low ticket + paid acquisition + no organic is a treadmill. Every month you stop running ads, revenue drops. That's not a growth wall — it's a dependency wall. The businesses I've seen break through this plateau usually do one of two things: move upmarket (fewer customers, higher price, better margins, referrals actually start happening because the relationship is deeper), or build a content moat that compounds over 6-12 months. Trying to do both simultaneously is how most founders burn out at this stage.\n\nOn the hire question: don't hire for growth. Hire for the specific bottleneck. If positioning is the problem, a growth marketer won't fix it. If lead quality is the problem, more volume makes it worse. Figure out which wall you're actually hitting before you write a job description.",

Here's what I'd focus on in the next 30 days:\n\nBrand mentions without links actually matter a lot for entity recognition. Get mentioned in local news, industry blogs, chamber of commerce newsletters, even podcast interviews where your business name gets said out loud (transcripts get indexed). Google uses these to understand what your brand \"is.\"\n\nContent that explicitly answers \"What is [Your Business Name]?\" in multiple places. Create a detailed About page, a FAQ that addresses your specific services, and a few blog posts that use your exact brand name in the title and body naturally. You want Google to see 10+ pages across the web clearly stating what you do.\n\nBacklinks still help, but quality over quantity. One link from a relevant industry site or local news outlet is worth 50 directory links. Reach out to suppliers, partners, anyone who already works with you and ask if they'll add you to their partners page.\n\nLocal press is underrated. Send a simple story pitch to your local news about what makes your business different or any community involvement. Even a small mention with your name and what you do can shift Google's understanding.\n\nSpeed matters too. If someone already claimed your brand name on social platforms or review sites, make sure you're active there and linking back to your site. Consistency across channels signals authority.\n\nIf I had 30 days, I'd do local PR first (easiest brand mention), then content clarifying exactly what you are (FAQ + About pages), then reach out for 3 to 5 quality backlinks from real partners. You're not fighting an algorithm, you're teaching Google what your brand actually is.\n\nHave you checked Google Search Console to see what queries are actually triggering your site? Sometimes the issue is your pages aren't ranking for your own brand name, which is a different fix.",

Brand mention campaigns - Reach out to past customers for testimonials that specifically mention your brand name. Even unlinked mentions help Google understand brand association.\n\n2. Strategic content creation - Create a 'Brand vs Alternatives' comparison page that naturally positions you as the original/primary option. This helps clarify the relationship to Google.\n\n3.

          "body": "Rolling reserves are standard for industries classified as high risk. This includes supplements, CBD, adult products, subscription boxes, travel, and a bunch of other categories the payment industry considers risky. It's not predatory, it's how every processor manages chargeback exposure for new merchants without processing history.\n\n10% for six months is actually on the moderate end. Some processors hold 10% for a full year or require upfront cash reserves before you even start processing. Your accountant is right that this should've been caught before signing, but what's done is done.\n\nThe fastest way out is building clean processing history. Zero chargebacks, low refund rates, and consistent volume for 3-4 months. Then call and renegotiate. Most processors will reduce or eliminate the reserve early if your account looks healthy because holding your money costs them administrative overhead too.\n\nFor cash flow in the meantime, factor that 10% into your pricing now. If you need $10k to operate, price to sell $11,200. It sucks but trying to operate on 90% of expected revenue without adjusting is how businesses hit payroll crunches. Also look into a small business line of credit to bridge the gap, it's cheaper than the panic of missing a damn payroll because your processor is sitting on your money.",

There are cheaper options like Patriot or OnPay that are like 30 dollars a month total.\nThe question is whether Gusto's extra cost is worth it for the features, people say it's easier to use and has better support but I don't know if that's worth an extra 300 dollars a year when I'm bootstrapped and watching every expense. The cheaper services seem to do the same basic stuff, calculate taxes, file forms, direct deposit.\nOn the other hand I've never done payroll before and I'm terrified of messing something up and getting fined by the IRS or state, if Gusto's UI makes it harder to screw up maybe the extra cost is worth it. Or maybe I'm overthinking this and they're all basically the same and I should just pick the cheapest one.\nHas anyone used both Gusto and one of the budget options and can tell me if there's actually a meaningful difference, or am I just paying for brand name with Gusto?",

And something will go wrong eventually - someone moves to a new state, you miscalculate overtime, you miss a filing deadline. That's where the real cost difference shows up.

          "body": "If you’ve never run payroll before, Gusto is usually worth it for peace of mind. The UI is very beginner-friendly, onboarding is smooth, and support is strong. That reduces the chance of mistakes with taxes or filings, which can get expensive fast with agencies like the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nCheaper tools like Patriot Software or OnPay do the core job fine. If you’re comfortable learning payroll basics and double-checking everything, they can save money.\n\nSimple way to decide:\n• Want lowest risk and less stress → Gusto\n• Comfortable handling details yourself → Patriot or OnPay\n\nFor three employees, the difference is mostly convenience and support, not capability.",

          "body": "I did look pretty seriously at some of the cheaper providers when I was setting things up a few years ago, but ultimately chose Gusto because the consistent feedback I saw was that their user interface &amp; support were meaningfully better.\n\nGusto sends you lots of reminders about compliance &amp; things you should to do. Honestly probably more than you need but I’m the type of person who likes getting reminders the I can decide whether to ignore them. \n\nLast year they automatically adjusted a tax payment that was due at end of year, without me doing anything. One feature I particularly like is how easy it is to adjust payroll if revenue fluctuates.\n\nMy only minor gripe: they continue charging the monthly fee even if you pause payroll (for example during parental leave), which felt annoying.\n\nIf you sign up with this code, you get a $100 or more Visa gift card when you run your first payroll:\nhttps://gusto.com/d/tiffanyae344680",
