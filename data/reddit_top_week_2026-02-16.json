They send you push notifications as soon as things are listed so that you are the first one to be able to message and go get a really good deal if something is listed way below what it’s worth.\n\nIt’s something that you can do during your days off, but also something that you can do in the morning/evenings before and after work and you can do the searching/lock down deals while at work.   \n  \nI’ve seen people in this sub that have commutes that are two hours long set up the app to look for things along their path to and from work and then they just set up pick ups/drop offs along their commute and they make a couple hundred extra bucks every week pretty much just doing the same thing they’re already doing.\n\nThat’s how most of these big guys are flipping cars, couches, phones, and other types of stuff. They aren’t paying the normal prices that you see, they’re paying way less and they’re doing that by being the first one to go get these deals from these people that underprice them either because they don’t know the value, or don’t care about the value and just want it gone.\n\nMy advice would be just find something that you know a lot about, use an app to look for you, and just pick up the best deals and make sure that you’re the first message. Pretty easy to make a couple hundred extra bucks a week and 100% something you can do while working because it doesn't take any work to find these if you're doing it right, and then all of the actual \"work\" you have to do can happen before/after normal work hours",

      "selftext": "I jumped into the event rental business (weddings, parties, etc) in June 2024. I realized how lucrative the wedding industry is and after spending a couple months watching TheRentalGuy on YouTube, I decided to take a shot.\n\nI had no idea how small or large I wanted to be. So, as most of us do, I faked it until I made it. After the LLC, I created a logo and put a listing on Facebook marketplace for table and chair rentals — the standard white padded chairs, round and rectangular tables. I posted about 8pm on a Friday and by 8:30pm I received my first booking… for a 300 person party! I owned nothing. I almost turned it down but instead I decided to ensure it was legitimate by meeting for a cash 50% deposit. I then spent $10k purchasing the equipment new (the rental was for $1500 a few months later, so I had time).\n\nI made 8k that August-December, then in 2025 business picked up about February again (seasonal) and I cleared just at 40k by EOY.\n\nThe 2 things I underestimated the most was the sheer size and space you need — I ran it out of a 16x22 detached garage. I had enough room to move around but had to be strategic. The other thing is the maintenance (chairs mainly). The white chairs need to be cleaned about half the time after being rented out. That takes most of my time. The preparation. I have some late Friday nights if I push it off until then to prep for the weekend, but on the weekends I’m spending maybe 3-4 hours before noon each day delivering and picking up. Some weeks a lot less work depending on the shape of the equipment and different factors.\n\nIt is the least passive of income there is. I’ve since purchased an enclosed trailer. And I’m worn out a lot.  If I can say no anytime. But on the other hand, once it’s paid off, it sure if nice to make a random $500 for maybe 2 hours worth of work on a Saturday morning. Between March and October, some weekends I make $200, others I make $3000. It’s solely up to how much time and inventory you have.\n\nYear 1 was a larger scale than I expected and I spread myself thin at times but I can scale back as much as I want. Even with 1/4 the equipment, a lot of $ can be made. It’s a great side hustle if you have the physical ability.",

The catch is nobody tells you about it, obviously they are not going to announce that stuff, you have to go find it yourself.  \n  \nEach claim takes maybe 15-20 min, most don't even need receipts, just need you to confirm you used whatever service during the right dates, I've gotten checks for $8 and checks for $340. average is probably around $75, but just know that it takes time  \n  \nAt first I was just googling and checking sites manually, it was okay but I couldnt remember all the services I used like 4 years ago (I cant even remember what I had for lunch yesterday lol), around june I tried using settlemate bc it flags based on actual purchases and accounts, I try to batch them, knock out 3-4 claims during lunch or while watching something.  \n  \nThe downsides are real tho, money is slow as hell, some pay in 6 weeks, some take like 8 months, you need patience, also this isn't replacing actual income, it's more like the same category as survey apps or cashback stuff, small effort, small returns, but it adds up.  \n  \nIf you're already doing beer money type things this fits right in, won't make you rich but $1200 for maybe 10 total hours of work spread across the year really helped me, I track everything in a spreadsheet so I know what's pending vs what already hit.",

One of our main selling points was that it worked offline and added tasks even without the internet. We tested the hell out of it. service workers, cache API, the whole deal. And it  worked flawlessly and we were so proud.\n\nNow, Fast forward to last week. Our app store rating 3.1 stars\n\nthe reviews were brutal \"offline mode doesn't work. tried on plane, nothing saved\"\n\n\"says it works offline but lost all my tasks when Wi-Fi came back\"\n\n\"false advertising tbh\"\n\nI was SO confused because it worked perfectly for me. opened dev tools, went offline, added tasks, went back online - everything synced. Then i checked our analytics chrome users: offline mode success rate 94% safari users offline mode success rate 38%\n\noh no!!!. We got to know that safari's service worker implementation is... how do i put this nicely like it’s Complete garbage. Specifically, Safari doesn't cache POST requests with service workers. Our app's core action was submitting a new task (POST request). So when iOS users went offline and added tasks, the service worker just... silently failed. they'd see the task in the UI (optimistic update), reconnect to Wi-Fi, and Boom!!! it's gone.\n\nI shipped a flagship feature that literally didn't work for 60% of mobile users.\n\nAnd the worst part? i only tested on chrome. my MacBook, my android phone, chrome dev tools. never once opened safari dev tools. We spent the last 4 days rebuilding with indexedDB + a sync queue that batches requests when connection returns. Now it actually works on safari. The new ratings were 4.2 stars and climbing.\n\nNow suggestions….If you're building a PWA and marketing offline functionality, TEST ON SAFARI and I would suggest testing it on drizz(dot)dev or xyz or any other tool out there. And don’t just \"open it and click around\" but actually profile the service worker behavior. safari and chrome are not the same.\n\nAnd from now ain’t no way we are using \"works offline!\" as a marketing point again….\n\n until we've tortured tested it on every browser lol….\n\n",

If it is to potentially build an online business you can make a living from, then start learning about the mindset for that, learn about affiliate marketing, content creation, etc, so you get familiar with different business models, and then make a decision on your direction based on that.\n\nBut one thing is to listen. Another thing: to really learn and see results, no matter which side hustle you choose, you need to start taking action and testing things. If you can bring a computer and use it during your commute, you can start taking action. Too many people get caught up in just listening, but without action, real learning will not happen.\n\nHope this helps.",

It gets the job done, but before I invest more time and money or lock myself into one setup long-term, I want to make sure I’m choosing something that fits how I actually work. Since this isn’t my main job, I care a lot about simple setup, stability during live events, and not having to troubleshoot when guests are waiting.\n\nI’d love to hear from people who explored different options before scaling up.

Maybe you have some connections then you could make it work but otherwise you might have to do both for a while to have a little bit of confidence.\n\nI would not recommend you yolo into this and quit or reduce your hours.

      "selftext": "I’m a student running a small resale side hustle, mostly through liquidation / mystery boxes.\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes I made early on was assuming electronics would be the most profitable category.\n\nOn paper, it makes perfect sense - higher ticket items, recognizable products, strong perceived value.\n\nReality was very different.\n\nThe problem with electronics (that no one tells beginners)\n\nWhen you open electronics-heavy boxes, things often look promising.\n\nYou might see:\n\nGadgets\n\nAccessories\n\nDevices\n\nBrand-name looking items\n\nBut resale is where the trouble starts.\n\nCommon issues I kept running into:\n\nUntested or partially working items\n\nMissing components or chargers\n\nLow-demand accessories\n\nProducts with almost no secondary market interest\n\nEven worse, diagnosing problems eats time. Testing, troubleshooting, researching compatibility - margins shrink fast when you account for effort.\n\nThe hidden killer: liquidity, not condition\n\nMany items weren’t broken.\n\nThey were simply hard to sell.\n\nSome products technically had value but sat for weeks or months. Price cuts didn’t help much because demand just wasn’t there.\n\nFor small sellers or anyone with limited capital, slow inventory is brutal.\n\nCash flow matters more than theoretical margins.\n\nWhy apparel behaved very differently\n\nEventually I shifted toward apparel / fashion-focused boxes, mostly out of frustration.\n\nUnexpectedly, the economics improved.\n\nNot because clothing items are expensive - often they’re not - but because they move.\n\nIn my experience:\n\nEasier to photograph &amp; list\n\nFewer functional failure points\n\nBroader buyer pool\n\nFaster turnover at lower price points\n\nEven when pricing aggressively, inventory cleared far more consistently than electronics.\n\nVariance still exists, but the downside feels manageable\n\nLiquidation is never perfectly predictable.\n\nBut with apparel, variability feels less destructive. A mediocre batch still tends to be sellable, whereas a bad electronics batch can become dead weight very quickly.\n\nOccasional higher-margin items are just a bonus, not something I rely on.\n\nBiggest takeaway so far\n\nIn mystery box reselling, the most important factor isn’t potential item value - it’s sell-through probability.\n\nElectronics may look exciting, but for my situation, apparel has been far more forgiving and sustainable.\n\nCurious if others here had similar experiences with category selection.",

      "selftext": "This is gonna sound super niche but I started renting out baby stuff to tourists through the internet about 11 months ago and its turned into way better income than I expected.\n\nI live near a popular spring destination and we get tons of families visiting for sports events and vacations. Parents don't wanna fly with car seats, cribs, strollers, all that bulky stuff so they just rent it when they get here. I started with a car seat and pack n play I bought secondhand for like $80 total, cleaned them up real good and listed them.\n\nFirst month I made maybe $200 but then summer hit and I was getting $600-800 monthly. Now I've got 6 car seats, 3 cribs, 2 strollers, a high chair and some other random stuff. Last month I cleared $1,240 and I probably spent 4 hours total on dropoffs and pickups.\n\nThe best part is most of the gear just sits in my garage between rentals. I'll get a booking notification, confirm it, drop the stuff off at their hotel or rental, then pick it up when they leave. Sometimes I don't even see them cause they leave it with the front desk. Takes 20 mins max per rental.\n\nInitial investment was around $900 from Stаke for everything and I hit break even after month 3. Now its pretty much pure profit minus the occasional replacement if something breaks. Been throwing most of it toward my emergency fund which needed some padding anyway.\n\nOnly annoying part is when people are weird about used gear even though everything gets sanitized between uses. Had one lady ask if the car seat was \"certified clean\" like there's some official baby gear certification lmao. But 95% of people are super chill and just happy they dont have to lug their own stuff through the airport.",

          "body": "The comments are ridiculous... people are giving you trouble for 30 minutes of cleaning and saying it's not passive income. No income is truly passive income, there is always some work that needs to go into it. I think this is good enough because you technically could hire a cleaner, but since it's such a small space and conveniently attached to the house, you don't really need to. \n\nFurthermore, all these people questioning the 30min clean-time probably aren't considering the fact that these are mostly short stays and a very small space as you mentioned (300sqft I believe). If it takes you 2+ hours to clean 300sqft space after someone lived in it for 2-3 days, then I would be quite concerned about your efficiency or the tenants themselves. \n\nI used to live in an 800 sqft apartment years ago and it would only take me 30min every few days to upkeep my place. This includes running a robot vacuum, doing a second pass with my dyson, mopping, running dishwasher, dusting and cleaning a single washroom. Once in a while (maybe every 1-2 months), I'll do a deep clean which would take an hour. I've received multiple compliments about cleanliness from guests + I'm OCD as well. \n\nSo really not sure why people are questioning you at all. ",

      "selftext": "I'm an accountant and last June I was watching TikTok at midnight when I saw some faceless account explaining credit cards with 2 million views. I thought I could do that and made my first video the next day.\n\nGot 147 views. My mom didn't even watch it.\n\nMade 11 more videos over three weeks. Highest was 380 views. Gave up for a month because it felt pointless. Then in August I posted one about savings accounts and it randomly got 50k views overnight. No idea why that one worked.\n\nThat's when I actually tried. The free text to speech sounded awful so I switched to APOB for the avatar stuff. It's not perfect, someone commented \"bro sounds like he's underwater\" which was fair, but I can make a video in 15 minutes now.\n\nI post 3 or 4 times a week after dinner. Account is at 7400 followers. Some videos get 30k views, some get 900. I made one explaining APR that I thought was solid and it died at 600 views. Then made one about Costco memberships as a joke and it got 40k. Algorithm is completely random.\n\nMoney breakdown last month: $47 from creator fund, $248 from affiliate link in my bio, had 31 people sign up for a budgeting app I actually use, and $45 from three people who Venmo'd me to answer credit questions which was weird but whatever. Total $340.\n\nThis month is tracking around $280. It's not consistent and definitely not quit your job money but it covers internet, Spotify, and usually leaves enough for drinks on the weekend. Takes maybe 2 hours a week total.\n\nWeirdest part is people think I'm some finance guru now. Someone asked me to manage their portfolio. I'm an accountant at a mid size firm, I just know how credit cards work because I explained it to my little brother five times.\n\nAlso had someone spam \"is this AI\" on every video so I started responding \"yes I'm a robot beep boop\" and they stopped.\n\nIf you're thinking about this just pick something you know and start posting. First 15 videos will probably suck. One will randomly hit and you'll figure it out. Don't expect thousands of dollars but $200-300 a month for basically no effort is doable.\n\nStill think it's kind of dumb but my roommate stopped making fun of me after I paid for pizza with TikTok money so I guess that's something.",

I personally have yet to try Prolific, but I was consistently making an extra $200 a month (\\~30min a day for 6 months) from doing surveys on cloud until I got banned for speeding through them, something I forgot they were against in their tos.\n\nYouTube - If you watch streamers, take clips from their streams, edit them, and upload them to youtube. I haven't made any money doing this yet, but I got a brand new channel to 800 subscribers and 650k views in just a month doing exactly what I just described. I've seen people making $10-20k a month doing this, but I think $100-300 is much more realistic.\n\nDaytrading - WAIT, I know how much flak it gets, but that's just because of how it's presented. People act as if it'll make you rich quick, which to be fair, it can, but a good rule of thumb is that if something could make you rich quick, it could make you poor quicker, so be careful and do a lot of research if you decide to do this. With strong pattern recognition, a ***LOT*** of discipline, and some common sense, you could definitely make a few extra $100s a month with this.\n\nTheme Pages - Find a niche (memes, beauty, cars, gaming, ect.) and make an instagram/yt/tiktok with it. After enough growth, companies will pay you thousands of dollars per post to promote their products/services. You could also do this to grow your own business, if you're interested in that.\n\nThese are the best ways that I know of that anyone could make an extra $1k a month. With all the information available to us nowadays, most of these are actually pretty easy, but they'll take a while, and you'll have to be extremely consistent, which is the real hard part.",

      "selftext": "28 male, Net worth \\~350k (40k liquid), cost of living $4-5k/month, currently make about $220k at my day job. Single asf.\n\nI started building apps on nights and weekends, and now have 3 apps that are doing numbers:\n\n1. a relationships app for couples ($5/month per couple) - almost 600 couples (applying a 40% tax for apple fees and actual money that's earmarked for taxes): $1800/mo and growing without ads (word of mouth/SEO) at about 5-10 users a day.\n\n2. a gamified sobriety test app (free, but limited play - average paying user is spending $1.77) - about 2200 new paying users a month: $2300\n\n3. the newest one, but fastest growing: A personality quiz that asks very different questions than typical quizzes/assessments. Instead of things like \"Would you consider yourself a generous person?\" It'll ask \"How many different beverages would be available to a guest in your home right now?\" and combine answers to that with another strictly objective question. The answers are fed to a trained AI that generates a sort of \"Wrapped\" style presentation of what kind of person it thinks you are, your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities etc. It's $1.99 to get your results. Launched a few weeks ago, but last week I had 466 paying users and I think I'm on pace for about 2500 next month. So, maybe: $3000.\n\nAll in, I am making about half as much as I make at my day job, but I'm only going to keep building and growing these user bases. But the question is, at what point can I quit? I have enough savings to last a while, but I'd be giving up a career that I've killed myself to get, and it's really not a hard job anymore. It is easy money, and I'm in line for a promo that'll take me to $350k within the year. Should I just keep doing both? Or should I focus full time on the apps? i just need some external, nonbias guidance. ",

Running 10 fanpages though means you're probably drowning in repetitive DMs and comments asking the same stuff over and over, which cuts into time you could spend scaling or creating better content. One thing that might help with the engagement overload is setting up better automated responses for teh FAQ stuff.\n\nI've read about creators using tools like Isonic that convert your existing content into a chatbot so fans can get instant answers without you being glued to your phone. It supposedly helps capture sales from people who would otherwise just ghost after asking questions. Worth looking into if you're trying to monetize those fan interactions more efficiently without adding hours to your day.\n\nEither way, what you've built is solid. The fact that you're thinking about group calls and paid consultations shows you're already thinking like a real business owner.",

Nearly all of my sales came from friends, neighbors and people I personally told. The store had customers but no matter how much I changed the prices or the pictures strangers weren't purchasing.\n\nThen I started searching like a customer like newborn winter outfits or best baby clothes brands. My brand did not show up. Thats when I realized people simply couldn’t find my store.\n\nWhat I actually did:\n\n* Updated product descriptions using language that customers really use to find\n* Added basic FAQs parents usually worry about (sizing, fabric comfort and washing)\n* Wrote simple guides to help first-time parents choose outfits\n* reorganized the categories to make the website easier to use.\n* I focused on the appropriate descriptions and instructions by using a tool to determine which places and search terms were bringing attention to my products.\n\nThese days the store consistently generates monthly sales and I probably put in two to three hours a week to maintain it. Although its not enough to quit your job it feels at last somewhat passive than before\n\nAnyone here started something new this year or next year? What worked for you? Share your experiences\n\n",

Dividends need rebalancing, side projects drift and even the low effort stuff punishes you if you completely ignore it. Lately I’ve been more focused on small, boring consistency. Not chasing home runs just stacking things that don’t demand daily attention. A little dividend reinvestment, some automated savings rules and occasionally parking small amounts where the risk is defined. I even mess around with tiny, disciplined bets from time to time, mostly as an exercise in restraint. Did one recently on Bracco while checking lines, set it and walked away, which honestly felt closer to passive than most things I’ve tried.  \n  \n  \nI want to know how others here define passive at this point. Are you aiming for truly hands off or just low maintenance and predictable? What’s actually worked long term for you?t?  \n",

Building a content site or YouTube channel during those 1 to 2 hours could compound over time. Takes months before it pays anything but once it's rolling the income is fairly passive.

I had zero knowledge of AI, automation, or software. ADHD helped in one way (ambition and optimism), but hurt in another (too many tools, monthly fees, and underuse). So I forced simplicity.\n\nOne day, alone in a hotel room with no phone, I spent hours talking to ChatGPT. I realised I didn’t lack ideas — I lacked *patterns*: what lots of people consistently want, urgently, and will pay for. So instead of asking “What can I launch fast?”, I asked “What system makes sense long-term?” I studied search behaviour in high-population countries, focusing on real pain, not curiosity. One rule: simple setup + fully automated.\n\nI tested a few options, picked one, and built it using a small stack:\n\n* **ChatGPT** for creativity and ideation\n* **Claude** to design/build the website and system\n* **Perplexity** for deep research.\n* Then I used **Cloudflare** (hosting and Workers automation), **Stripe** (payments), **MailerLite/Brevo** (emails), and **HTMLtoPDF** (to convert results into a PDF report).\n\nThe model was simple: a free personalised report for a specific sector, and a paid premium version delivered automatically. No calls, no onboarding, no consulting, no manual fulfilment. It runs on its own — and it has reached **€100k** in fully automated revenue.\n\nIf I can leave you with anything:\n\n* Build around real pain points\n* Think longer than feels comfortable before committing\n* Only execute when the model is aligned and simple\n* You don’t need to understand everything upfront — learn step by step\n\nGood luck to everyone.",

Those usually pay way better than generic online jobs and actually value your background. I’ve also seen doctors make decent money creating exam prep notes, selling study guides, or freelancing for healthcare startups.\n\nTry platforms like Upwork or LinkedIn and search specifically for medical-related roles instead of broad remote jobs. It might take a little time to land the first one, but once you do, it gets much easier.\n\nAlso please be careful with anything that sounds like “easy money” or requires upfront payment.

What's actually working for me (and some of it s pretty uncommon):\n\nAmazon Associates. I have a few old blog posts that still convert. The 24-hour cookie is annoying but if the content is evergreen it just trickles in without me doing anything\n\nSoftware tools with recurring commissions. This one I really like. You refer someone to a tool like ConvertKit or Beehiiv, they stay subscribed, you get a cut every single month. Not a one-time $10 bonus, actual recurring income.\n\nHosting referrals. Wrote one tutorial two years ago. Still getting occasional payouts from it.\n\nTelegram creator tools. More niche but I refer people to service called Tribute, it's a platform for running paid groups on Telegram. They pay 2% of whatever that creator earns, indefinitely. Referred a few people who run active paid communities and now it just sits there and pays out. Not huge individually but it stacks. At one point i literally texted you-know-what-kind of creators offering then to join lmao it worked somehow tho\n\nThe pattern is kinda the same. Do something useful once, a post, a tutorial, a recommendation, and then forget about it. The ones that actually compound are always recurring commission models, not one-time payouts",

Always hearing about passive income online, but every time I look into it, it's either super technical or requires a ton of upfront cash. \n\n\n\nI tried the whole Etsy digital products thing last year – spent weeks making printables, listed them, and... crickets. Maybe made $50 over three months? Not exactly life-changing. Or maybe I just suck at marketing, who knows. \n\n\n\nAnyway, I was scrolling through some forums the other day (probably should've been sleeping), and stumbled on this thing called Bradley Woods Affiliate Mentor. It's an AI-powered system that automates affiliate marketing, claims you only need a $25 one-time investment and it runs 24/7. Sounds almost too good to be true, right? Like, I'm skeptical as hell because I've been burned by 'get-rich-quick' stuff before. But part of me is curious – has anyone here actually tried something like this? Or know if it's legit? \n\n\n\nWait, actually, I think I'm getting ahead of myself. The real question is: what passive income ideas have you all found that are actually sustainable without turning into a second job? I'm talking about stuff that, after you set it up, you can mostly forget about. \n\n\n\nFor context, I'm a dad with two kids, so time is tight. No tech skills either, which doesn't help. \n\n\n\nSo yeah, what's worked for you? Dividend investing? Rental properties with a manager? Or any online systems that are truly hands-off? And if you've dabbled in automated affiliate stuff, I'd love to hear your take – good or bad.",

Most people your age are just scrolling.\n\nFirst, I’m going to be real with you: at 15, you shouldn’t be chasing “passive income.” You should be building skills that pay for the next 10 years.\n\nHere’s what actually works:\n\n1. Learn one high-income skill.\nPick ONE brother \n\n\t•\tVideo editing\n\t•\tGraphic design\n\t•\tCopywriting\n\t•\tSocial media management\n\t•\tCoding\n\nYou can learn all of these free on YouTube. Give it 3–6 months of focused practice and you can start charging.\n\n2. Offer services locally.\nPeople overcomplicate making money.\n\n\t•\tCut grass\n\t•\tWash cars\n\t•\tFlip snacks at school\n\t•\tEdit TikToks for small creators\n\t•\tDesign flyers for small businesses\n\nSimple work = no work.\n\n3. Flip things.\nGo on Facebook Marketplace or local groups. Look for underpriced items. Clean them up. Resell. Even $10–$20 profit per flip adds up fast.\n\n4. Avoid these traps\n\n\t•\t“Get rich quick” courses\n\t•\tCrypto gambling\n\t•\tDropshipping without money\n\t•\tRandom online surveys expecting big cash\n\nAt your age, your biggest advantage is TIME. If you spend the next 2–3 years stacking skills instead of chasing fast money, you’ll be ahead of 95% of people by 18.\n\nOne more thing don’t feel pressure to be rich right now. Focus on becoming valuable. Money follows value.",

After I accepted the offer, the HR manager told me that they use a Time Doctor to track the activity.\n\nNormally, I take full responsibility for honestly working all 8 hours, and I have previously experienced micromanagement with excessive control from a toxic manager. Because of that, being tracked with a software seems not so bad for me.\n\nThe issue is that I will be working in regulatory affairs, which involves a lot of research, reading, and reviewing documents. I understand that there is an idle time, and for example, if you are actively reading and thinking for 3–5 minutes, Time Doctor may consider that idle time. It also seems that you cannot use the bathroom or take a short break between tasks to think, because it generates idle time.\n\nI would like to hear about the experiences of other remote workers who use Time Doctor. Do you have problems with idle time due to research or reading tasks?\n\nSome of you might say that I should have refused a job that uses a time tracker, as it could be a red flag that the company does not trust its employees. But to be honest, the job market is insane. It took me 4 months to find this job, and I feel I have nothing to lose. If I am not satisfied with the workplace, I will simply continue searching for another job.\n\nThank you in advance.",

I actually applied for several legal transcriptionist positions: eScribers, which I am in the orientation phase, Transcribeme, which I just submitted by second probation file to see if I am accepted into \"Legal Phoenix\"... A couple of others that I have not made it passed the initial part yet / they do not seem as big of companies, as the 3 main ones are... Casting Words &amp; Transcription Hub. I have done a bit of research, and it looks like between the 3.. Allegis pays the highest, then eScribers, then Transcribeme. Transcribeme, is strictly download the files read them and learn on your own. Once you make it past the legal tests, there is a group you can ask questions to. eScribers, once you get to the interview and decide you want to give it a try, they give you a mentor. There is actually a lot more technical pieces to eScribers than Transcibeme from what I see so far, but I enjoy it more.\n\nI have read that with Allegis, if you are offered the phone interview you are basically in, just like eScribers, however someone else mentioned above that was not the case for them so maybe that is incorrect. I have read that you have to commit to a min. of 20 hours per week as well. Again, not confirmed just what I read. I am not sure if you have tried any of the other transcription places, but if you have not, I would definitely recommend attempting Transcribme's legal tests. Just try passing them alone will give you a significant amount of knowledge that can help you with transcribing in general. The way that they have their system set up is definitely entry level friendly. Good Luck on your interview, I'm sure you will do great, but if you do not. Don't sweat try one of these other companies!",

      "selftext": "Started this site last May. Writing about personal finance stuff, mostly credit cards and budgeting apps. Figured people searching for \"Card A vs Card B\" are probably ready to apply.\n\nFirst five months were dead. Like maybe 150 visitors total by September. I was writing twice a week, following all the SEO advice, but nothing was happening. Started thinking I picked the wrong niche.\n\nOctober things started moving. Traffic went from nothing to around 500 visitors a day. I was checking Google Analytics constantly. November hit 780. By December I was at 950 daily visitors and made $2,100 that month. I remember sitting at my desk just staring at the dashboard because I couldn't believe it was real.\n\nJanuary I made $2,800. Traffic was still around 950 a day, maybe 1,000 on good days. Thought okay this is it, it's going to keep growing.\n\nNow it's February and I'm still at 950 visitors. Revenue is around $2,600 this month so far. It's just stuck there. Traffic isn't growing at all.\n\nI've got 61 posts published. Still doing two per week like I have been. But new posts aren't ranking. My best post is a credit card comparison that ranks number 3 and makes about $740 a month by itself. I've written four more comparison posts trying to copy that success. None of them rank past page 2.\n\nThe posts that already rank are fine. They're not moving up but they're not dropping either. It's like I hit my ceiling.\n\nI started adding comparison tables in January. Like actual side by side breakdowns of fees and rewards. Takes longer to build but I thought it would help. Haven't seen any ranking changes yet. Maybe it's too soon, I don't know.\n\nGot an email list too. Around 620 people now. Growing maybe 25 a week. When I email about a new post I usually get a few signups. Email probably drives 10 or 15 percent of revenue but it's hard to track because people click through and apply later.\n\nConversion rate is around 1.4% which seems okay for finance. Most signups come from the comparison posts where I break down which card is better for specific situations. Takes way longer to write but people seem to trust it more.\n\nTried making some explainer videos in December. Used Canva for graphics and messed around with APOB and a couple other tools to make talking head style videos without showing my face. Made like three videos explaining credit card rewards programs. Got maybe 200 views total on YouTube. Took forever to put together so I gave up on that pretty quick.\n\nTried guest posting in January. Reached out to maybe 30 finance blogs. Got two guest posts published. Saw zero change in rankings.\n\nAlso tried Facebook ads for like two weeks in November. Spent around $240 targeting people interested in credit cards. Got maybe 160 clicks and literally zero applications. Not even one. Thought my tracking was broken but nope, just zero conversions. Stopped that immediately.\n\nTried Twitter too. Posted tips and linked to my posts for like three weeks. Got maybe 80 followers and like 20 clicks total. Waste of time.\n\nI post on Reddit sometimes in personal finance subs when I can actually help without being promotional. Drives maybe 100 visitors a month but most of them bounce anyway.\n\nUsing Ahrefs for keywords. $99 a month which sucks.\n\nWhat's frustrating is I don't know what changed. Traffic was growing every month from October to December. Then it stopped. I'm doing the same stuff. Same quality, same keywords, same everything.\n\nAlso seeing bigger sites like NerdWallet and The Points Guy covering the same cards I write about. They have way more authority so I'm probably screwed competing with them. Trying to find more specific angles like \"best credit cards for small business owners under 30\" but those get barely any searches.\n\nSpending maybe 18 hours a week on this. Writing takes forever when you have to research all the terms and conditions.\n\nTraffic is flat. Revenue is basically flat. New posts aren't ranking.\n\nDid Google change something in December or January? I keep seeing people talk about algorithm updates but I can't tell if I got hit.\n\nAnyone else stuck like this? I keep going back and forth on whether I should just keep doing what I'm doing or try something completely different. But I don't even know what different would look like. Like should I stop writing new posts and just update the ones that already rank? Should I try to get more backlinks even though guest posting didn't work? Should I just wait it out?\n\nI don't know. Some days I think I just need to be patient. Other days I think I'm wasting my time.",

      "selftext": "\n\nBeen looking at a lot of deal flow over the past 6-8 months and theres a pattern I keep noticing that I think is worth talking about. Not every type of online business is trending the same direction valuation-wise. Some categories are compressing, some are flat, and a few are quietly getting more expensive to acquire. I wanted to break down the three I keep seeing come up.\n\n\n\nFirst one is vertical SaaS for non-tech industries. Think software built for plumbers, dentists, property managers, small logistics companies. These industries are digitizing but they're doing it slowly and with very few options. Which means when someone builds a tool that actually works for, say, a regional plumbing company to manage scheduling and invoicing... that customer is not leaving. Ever. They're not browsing G2 on weekends looking for alternatives. They found something, it works, their admin person learned it, and thats that.\n\n\n\nI've seen vertical SaaS tools with pretty modest MRR, like $15-30k range, get competing offers because acquirers understand that the switching costs are massive and the TAM is still expanding. These industries haven't even scratched the surface of software adoption. Monthly churn on some of these is sub-2%, sometimes closer to 1.1-1.4%. Multiples are creeping up because buyers are pricing in the retention and the runway, not just current revenue.\n\n\n\nSecond category is one I find genuinely interesting. Productized services that are converting into software. So imagine a company that started doing manual SEO audits as a done-for-you service. Charging $500-800 per audit, doing maybe 40-60 a month. Then they build a tool that automates like 80% of the audit process. Now they've got proven demand (people already pay for this), improving margins because delivery is getting cheaper, and a path toward full SaaS economics.\n\n\n\nThese are fascinating from a buyer perspective because you're not guessing whether people want the thing. You already know they do. You're just watching the margin structure improve over time. I looked at one of these last year where gross margins went from 41% to 68% over 14 months just from automating parts of their fulfillment. The revenue barely changed but the business got dramatically more valuable.\n\n\n\nThird is micro-SaaS with integration or API plays. Small tools that plug into bigger ecosystems... Shopify apps, Salesforce integrations, Slack bots, tools that are Zapier-native. The thing about these is distribution is partially solved by the platform itself. You're not spending $4k/month on paid acquisition hoping your landing page converts. People find you in the app store while they're already looking for a solution.\n\n\n\nAnd once your tool is embedded in someone's workflow, the stickiness is insane. I looked at a Shopify app doing $22k MRR that had net revenue retention of like 113% because existing users kept upgrading as their stores grew. The app just grew with them. Churn was there but expansion revenue more than covered it.\n\n\n\nWhat I think is actually driving all three of these trends is the same underlying thing. Buyers are getting smarter about what \"defensible\" actually means. It's not about having a patent or some proprietary algorithm. It's about structural switching costs, embedded workflows, and expanding TAMs in categories where competition is still thin. Those three things together are what's making acquirers pay up.\n\n\n\nIf you're building in one of these categories and wondering whether the market values what you're doing... it probably does more than you think. And if you're not in one of these categories, I'm not saying your business isn't valuable, but it might be worth thinking about whether theres a way to move toward one of these dynamics. The margin structure one especially. I keep seeing sellers underestimate how much a clear trajectory matters to buyers even when the current numbers are mid.\n\n\n\nAnyway just patterns I've been noticing. Could be wrong about where things go from here but the deal data over the last year or so has been pretty consistent on this stuff.",

      "selftext": "TL;DR: Two-thirds of Skimlinks programs have no click data. The median EPC is $0.14. Commission rate is the wrong thing to optimize - EPC is. Interactive report with full data in comments.\n\nI pulled every program on Skimlinks (\\~29k) and categorized against a clean set of verticals. Here's what stood out.\n\n**1. There are way more dead programs than you'd expect.**\n\nOf 28,844 programs listed, 19,191 (66.5%) have no click data - no EPC, no conversion rate, no basket size. They're in the directory, but there's no evidence clicks are converting.\n\nSome could be new listings or programs that are primarily active on other networks. But even if you're generous and assume a quarter of them are just new -that still means roughly half the catalog is dead weight. The actual pool of programs generating real earnings is far smaller than the directory makes it look.\n\n**2. Commission rate is the wrong way to pick programs. EPC is better (when you have it).**\n\nCommission rate is the vanity metric everyone chases. \"This program pays 12%!\" But it ignores basket size and conversion rate - the two things that actually determine what you earn per click.\n\nEPC (earnings per click) = commission rate × average basket size × conversion rate. It captures the full picture in one number.\n\nHere are the top 10 programs on the entire Skimlinks network by EPC:\n\n|Program|EPC|Commission|Avg Basket|CVR|What's driving it|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Akind DE|$15.41|12.4%|$361|34.5%|Monster CVR|\n|ZenBusiness|$12.40|37.1%|$227|14.7%|High commission × high CVR|\n|GuestReady|$9.25|5.0%|$633|29.2%|Huge basket × huge CVR|\n|RajaniMD|$9.10|15.9%|$184|31.2%|High commission × monster CVR|\n|Ivim Health|$7.94|21.4%|$524|7.1%|Big basket × high commission|\n|Misha and Puff|$7.35|20.0%|$300|12.3%|Premium pricing × solid CVR|\n|smava|$7.33|1.5%|$20,628|2.4%|$20k basket - commission is irrelevant|\n|Cloud Water Filters|$6.64|58.2%|$354|3.2%|Extreme commission|\n|WECREAT TECH|$6.19|8.0%|$1,168|6.6%|$1k+ basket does the work|\n|Beeksebergen|$4.85|6.6%|$684|10.8%|Holiday rental - big basket × solid CVR|\n\nNot one of these would rank near the top if you sorted by commission rate alone. smava pays 1.5% commission and earns $7.33 per click because the average order is $20,000. GuestReady pays 5% and earns $9.25 because people book $633 stays and convert at 29%.\n\nThere are really only two equations that produce high EPC:\n\n**Big basket × modest commission** \\- travel, accommodation, finance, high-ticket goods. You don't need a high commission when someone books a $1,700 hotel stay at 5%.\n\n**High commission × high CVR** \\- health, business, education. Smaller baskets but 10–30% conversion rates. Volume compensates.\n\nThe trap is picking programs with moderate everything. Decent commission, average basket, average CVR. That's where most programs live and it's where EPC goes to die.\n\n**3. These patterns hold across every vertical.**\n\nI classified all 9,323 programs with EPC data into 21 verticals (using cross-network data from CJ, Impact, FlexOffers, and Awin to fix Skimlinks' messy categorization). The same two paths show up at the category level:\n\n|Vertical|Programs|Avg EPC|Avg Basket|CVR|Commission|What's working|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Finance &amp; Insurance|58|$0.66|$1,277|5.0%|12.2%|Big basket|\n|Jewellery|136|$0.43|$383|3.5%|8.4%|Big basket|\n|Travel &amp; Accommodation|444|$0.40|$612|3.5%|6.4%|Big basket|\n|Health &amp; Wellness|646|$0.35|$100|5.4%|10.6%|High CVR|\n|Sports &amp; Outdoors|404|$0.34|$217|4.6%|6.6%|Balanced|\n|...|||||||\n|Software &amp; Technology|142|$0.22|$69|2.1%|31.6%|Nothing - CVR kills it|\n\n(6 of 21 verticals. Full breakdown in the interactive report.)\n\nFinance earns $0.66/click on a $1,277 basket at just 12.2% commission. Software has the highest commission rate of any vertical (31.6%) and the lowest EPC ($0.22) because almost nobody converts (2.1% CVR).\n\n**4. The EPC distribution is brutal.**\n\nOf the 9,356 programs with a measurable EPC:\n\n* 46% earn less than $0.10 per click\n* The median is $0.14\n* Only 5.7% break $1.00\n* Just 9 programs in the entire network exceed $5.00\n\nThe distribution is massively right-skewed. Most programs cluster between $0.01 and $0.25. If you're picking programs without checking EPC, you're almost certainly landing in that pile.\n\n**5. The one thing to take from this:**\n\nSort by EPC, not commission rate. If a network doesn't show you EPC, calculate it from basket size and conversion rate. If they don't show you those either, that's a red flag in itself.\n\nThe interactive report has the full vertical breakdown with reversal rates, the top 20 programs ranked by EPC, EPC distribution charts, and a commission-vs-EPC scatter plot; below.\n\nThis is one network. I'm building the same analysis across CJ, Impact, ShareASale, Rakuten, Awin, and others - a free directory that surfaces EPC, basket size, conversion rates, reversal rates, and commission structures across 50,000+ listings. More on that in comments.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the data or methodology.\n\n*Data: 28,844 programs on Skimlinks, 9,356 with non-zero EPC. Vertical classification used cross-network category matching against CJ, FlexOffers, Impact, Awin, and others, with Skimlinks categories and manual review as fallback. All 9,323 programs with EPC data classified across 21 verticals. EPC/basket/CVR averages use non-zero values only. Full methodology in the interactive report.*",

Think old-school directories, but cleaner and searchable.\n\nThe issue is that I have traffic but no **revenue** right now.\n\nI don’t really want to use AdSense.  \nNot because of earnings only, but because:  \n• approval is annoying  \n• I’ve seen accounts randomly banned  \n• Ads don’t match directory users very well  \n• It makes the site look spammy\n\nWhat I’m trying to find is something more “integrated”.\n\nWhat I mean:  \nIdeally, I’d like a monetisation method where I can **add a code/script to my site** that automatically displays relevant content (listings, offers, tools, widgets, etc.) instead of traditional banner ads.\n\nBasically:  \nnot popups  \nnot gambling ads  \nnot shady downloads\n\nMore like:  \n— contextual marketplace  \n— sponsored listings  \n— useful widgets  \n— something that fits a directory\n\nI already thought about:  \n• paid submissions  \n• featured listings\n\nBut I feel I’m missing something smarter that other directory owners use.\n\nSo my question to people who run sites:  \n**What monetisation methods actually worked for you on informational or directory websites that are NOT AdSense?**\n\nEspecially if it’s something that can be installed via a code snippet or a widget.\n\nI’m open to anything — affiliate networks, APIs, widgets, SaaS partnerships, etc.\n\nWould really appreciate real experiences rather than theory.\n\nThanks 🙏",

When you signal \"this might not be for you,\" their brain flips from evaluating to wanting.\n\n  \nWhen it works best: prospects who are comparison shopping or skeptical. The more options they have, the more powerful this is. Also great with higher-ticket deals where the buyer expects to be sold hard.\n\n  \nWhen to skip it: early stage prospects who barely know what they need yet. If someone is still figuring out the problem, telling them they might not be a fit just gives them permission to leave. They need education first, not a challenge.\n\n  \nThe balance question is the right one to ask. What worked for me was being specific about WHY they might not be a fit, not just vaguely saying \"we're not for everyone.\" Like \"honestly, if your team isn't ready to change their current workflow, this won't help you.\" That way you're filtering for real fit, not just playing a psychology trick. And if they push back with reasons they ARE a fit, those reasons become their own buying arguments that you never had to make yourself.",

And the information going the other direction - customer to you - is always more valuable than your pitch going the other way.\n\n  \nThe question of when to use it comes down to whether you're selling to people who already know they have the problem. If they reached out to you, they know. Anti-selling just makes them articulate it clearly. If you're cold outreach, they might not know they have the problem yet, and anti-selling gives them an easy exit.",

I haven't tried this approach, but if I were, it would be using this approach the second someone became standoffish upon realizing I'm in sales, because it's right then you know that they don't care what they need, they don't want to feel persuaded into buying something. So by going the route of anti-sale, you're basically making them feel as if they're in control, which innately makes them more comfortable. ",

      "selftext": "Cold calling isn't dead. Bad cold calling is dead. I tracked every call this month and the data tells a clear story.\n\nOut of 820 dials, I got 124 connects which is about 16 percent connect rate. Of those connects, 32 turned into real conversations over 3 minutes. And 12 of those became booked meetings.\n\nThe math breaks down to roughly 72 calls per meeting. Not amazing, but profitable when your deal size is right.\n\nHere's what I learned about openers this month. I tested three different approaches across roughly equal call volumes. The pattern interrupt opener where I said something unexpected like \"Hey this is a cold call, you can hang up but give me 18 seconds first\" got 30 percent to stay on the line past 30 seconds. The permission-based opener where I asked \"Did I catch you at a bad time\" got 22 percent. The direct pitch where I immediately explained why I was calling got only 14 percent.\n\nThe pattern interrupt felt awkward at first but the data was clear. People appreciate honesty about what's happening.\n\nOn timing, I found that Tuesday through Thursday between 10 AM and 11:30 AM had the highest connect rates at 19 percent. Monday mornings were brutal at 9 percent. Friday afternoons were dead at 5 percent. I stopped calling Fridays after lunch entirely.\n\nThe biggest insight was about follow-up after missed calls. I left 310 voicemails. Got 7 callbacks. That's barely 1 percent. But when I stopped leaving voicemails and instead sent a quick LinkedIn message within 5 minutes of the missed call, I got 22 responses from 156 attempts. That's 14 percent. The multi-touch approach crushed voicemail-only.\n\nMy current approach is to call, if no answer send immediate LinkedIn connection with a note referencing the call, then follow up with email the next day. This three-channel approach within 24 hours gets way better results than any single channel alone.\n\nThe psychology behind why this works is simple. People are busy. They miss calls all the time. But when they see the same person tried to reach them through multiple channels, it signals importance. It also creates familiarity. By the time they see your email, they've already seen your name twice.\n\nThe reps on my team who adopted this approach saw their meeting rates increase by 37 percent within the first month. The ones who stuck to single-channel calling stayed flat.\n\nCold calling works but it's not about the call anymore. It's about how the call fits into a larger sequence. The phone is the start of the conversation, not the whole thing.\n\nIf you're still measuring success by calls made, you're missing the point. Measure conversations started across all channels. That's what actually predicts revenue.",

Are you running SMS campaigns through something like Twilio or using a platform, and are you building the automation yourself or using off-the-shelf tools? The margin difference between those two approaches is massive at scale.\n\nAlso, one thing I've seen work well for local service lead gen: once you nail the playbook for one vertical (say pressure washing), the same system usually transfers to adjacent verticals with minimal tweaking. Landscaping, HVAC, roofing. The outreach mechanics are nearly identical, just different keywords and seasonal patterns. That's where the real compounding happens.",

You may get some quick wins, but don't be lulled into thinking that's every day. \n2. Surround yourself with people smarter than yourself.  It's the smartest thing you can do. \n3. Practice self-care. Entrepreneurship requires every bit of you. Every single day. (And most nights.) Exercise. Eat well. Meditate. Rest. The basics. But you have to do them better, than most other people, just to keep moving forward. Do not underestimate this. \n\nP.S. I did spend a few years working for other companies.

But the businesses that actually scaled were the ones where I stepped back and asked \"how can I make this repeatable without me?\"\n\nDocumenting processes felt like a waste of time when I was busy. But once I had systems in place, I could delegate, I could take a real vacation, and honestly the business ran better without me micromanaging every detail.\n\nThe other thing I'd add: Get comfortable with saying no. Every opportunity looks good when you're hungry. But chasing every shiny object dilutes your focus and burns your energy. Learning to say \"that's interesting but it's not aligned with where I'm going\" was a game changer.\n\nCurious what your thoughts are on delegation vs doing it yourself.

      "selftext": "So I wasted like 3.5 years trying every productivity system. Bought some $150 Notion template from a YouTuber (embarrassing). Did the whole Todoist thing, Obsidian, bullet journals, all of it.\n\nBasically I wasn't actually working. Just organizing my work and feeling productive about organizing. Being busy doesnt equal getting important shit done.\n\nEvery morning id open whatever app and see like 40+ tasks, spend 20 minutes moving shit around and color coding it. Then do one easy task and call it a day. The actual important stuff? Always \"tomorrow\"\n\nI had 40 tasks every day. Would finish maybe 1. The other 39 just sitting there judging me. Way too many to even know where to start so I'd just pick whatever seemed easiest.\n\nThe list was the whole problem.\n\nSo i said fuck it and deleted everything, every app, every so called productivity tool. Bought a small whiteboard from around the corner.\n\nMade one rule: only what fits on here matters today. That's it.\n\nWrote 3 tasks. Not 40. Just the 3 actual important things I need to do to get closer to my goals. Things that can actually be done in a workday.\n\nWith only a few realistic tasks, you can't hide anymore. With 40 tasks theres always an excuse like \"oh ill do that big one after i knock out these 5 quick things\" but with 3? You either do them or you dont and you know it.\n\nWhen I finished something I'd get up, walk over, cross it off with this red marker. It stayed there all day with the line through it. Could actually see what i did. Which gives me some validation that I am moving forward.\n\nThis worked amazing! No anxiety, no busyness. Just getting shit done.\n\nMy buddy came over and just started reading my tasks out loud. \"Yo whats this project about?\" Just reading my whole board.\n\nSame thing on video calls, people asked about the whiteboard behind me, trying to read it.\n\nAnd I work from home so its in my living space. In the evening trying to get a clear head and my tasks are right there staring at me.\n\nBut i couldn't hide it because seeing it was the entire point. That was the whole system.\n\nSo I got this idea, what if it just flips. One side is the whiteboard for tasks. Other side is just clean wood that actually looks good on a wall without office vibes. No art needed, just nice &amp; clean looking surface.\n\nTook me forever to figure out how to make it light enough to actually flip easily and stick with magnetic fixation. Tried a bunch of materials that were either too heavy or looked like crap. Went through like 10 different prototypes. Tested several concepts, some worked great but i just didnt like them aesthetically so i moved on until something clicked.\n\nReal lesson tho is 3 tasks you actually finish beats 40 tasks you organize and never do. Less isnt limiting its just focus. Being busy doesnt always equals getting shit done.\n\nObviously this is the polished version. There were a LOT of ups and downs in between.",

Had Notion databases with color-coded priorities, tags, deadlines for everything. Spent more time maintaining the system than doing actual work.\n\n  \nWhat finally clicked for me was realizing that long task lists are just anxiety lists. They make you feel busy without making progress on anything that matters. When you only have 3 things, you cant hide behind \"oh ill do the hard one after these quick wins\" because there are no quick wins to hide behind.\n\n  \nThe physical aspect is key too. Something about writing by hand and physically crossing things off hits different than checking a box in an app. I think its because digital tools are too forgiving. You can drag, snooze, reschedule, archive. A whiteboard just stares at you.\n\n  \nThe privacy problem you ran into is interesting too and honestly a good sign. It means the system is visible enough to actually hold you accountable. Thats the whole point. The flip mechanism sounds like a clean solution to that.\n\n  \nCurious how many prototypes you went through before landing on the magnetic fixation. Hardware iteration cycles are brutal compared to software where you can ship a fix in minutes.",

Made the whole journey feel way less lonely and gave me something real to focus on instead of other people's highlight reels\n\n  \nIt's definitely part of the process though, that mental game is probably harder than the actual building sometimes 💀",

Nobody posts \"day 47, still zero paying users, ate cereal for dinner.\"\n\nSomething that helped me reframe it: those people posting 10k MRR didn't get there by scrolling Reddit and comparing themselves to other people posting 10k MRR. They got there by closing the app and doing one uncomfortable thing per day. One cold email, one user interview, one feature shipped.\n\nAlso worth remembering that \"first few paying users\" is genuinely the hardest milestone in any business. Going from 0 to 1 is harder than going from 100 to 1000. If you can get strangers to pay you money for something you built, you're already ahead of most people who just talk about starting something.",

      "selftext": "We're a small software dev shop (4 people, veteran-owned SDVOSB) that builds custom software for government and enterprise clients. We've closed over $1M in contracts in roughly 2 years. The average deal is around $100K, and the lifetime client value sits around $350K as they re-up.\n\nHere's the thing: almost all of that came from me and my network. Every time we've tried to bring on a salaried salesperson, it's been the same story. Pay them for months, they don't close anything, and we're out a chunk of cash we could've reinvested into the business. It's happened multiple times now, and honestly, it's one of the most frustrating parts of scaling.\n\nSo we shifted our thinking. We put together what I think is a solid commission structure:\n\n* 10% on the initial downpayment\n* 5% on all recurring revenue from their clients\n* 30% of anything sold above our base proposal (so if we quote $100K and they close at $130K, they keep 30% of that $30K)\n\nWe'd also cover conference tickets and events since that's a big part of how deals happen in this space.\n\nOn a typical deal, that's around $10K upfront with recurring income over the client's lifetime. Not bad for someone who knows how to sell and doesn't need their hand held.\n\nBut I genuinely cannot figure out where to find people who are actually good at sales AND willing to work commission. Every platform I've tried is either flooded with people who want a base salary no matter what, or with people who talk a big game but don't deliver.\n\nFor those of you who've been in a similar spot, where did you actually find your salespeople? Did commission only work for you, or did you just bite the bullet and keep paying salaries until someone stuck? Also open to hearing if my comp structure is off, always willing to adjust.\n\nAppreciate any insight. This is the one piece of the puzzle I haven't figured out yet.",

          "body": "We're a similar size dev shop and went through the exact same cycle. Hired two salespeople over a year and a half, neither closed a single deal. The problem is that selling custom software is fundamentally different from selling a product. Your prospects need someone who can talk architecture, understand scope, and build trust around technical competence. A traditional salesperson can't do that.\n\nWhat worked for us was treating sales as a partnership function, not a hire. We found two channel partners (an agency and a consulting firm) who already had relationships with the types of clients we serve. They bring us into conversations when a client needs custom dev work, and we give them a referral cut. No salary risk, no ramp-up time, and the leads come pre-qualified because the partner already has trust.\n\nYour commission structure looks reasonable, but I'd add one thing: make sure whoever you bring on has genuine technical literacy. They don't need to code, but they need to understand enough to have a credible conversation about what you build and why it matters. That's the filter most dev shops miss.",

Off the back of the workshop the client receives detailed documents of what they want to build. It’s a recommended architecture, feature and design doc. They see what they get in their MVP and their roadmap. You would essentially do a version of this when they sign up anyway but by doing it as a separate product there’s a low cost and low friction step that provides real value. Technically they can shop the doc to get quotes on the build but no one ever did because the relationship is built and they’re already in motion (especially now days when you have a tool like Figma make that can punch out a prototype in a few minutes and include mock UIs in the workshop doc 🤯). For sales people their close rate went up exponentially because they weren’t selling $100k build which will normally need several people to sign off on instead they were selling a $5-$10k workshop which usually only needs one person to sign off on.

          "body": "The reason you keep losing money on salaried salespeople is that government/enterprise software sales has a long cycle and a very specific skillset. Most salespeople who apply to small shops are used to selling something with a shorter close and an established brand behind them. They flounder when they have to open doors from scratch in a niche like SDVOSB contracting.\n\n  \nYour commission structure is actually solid for someone who understands the space. The problem is where you are looking. A few things that have worked for other small shops in similar positions:\n\n  \n1. Look for retired or semi-retired government contracting officers or program managers. These people have the rolodex and understand procurement, but they are done with full-time work. Commission-only or part-time with commission is perfect for them. Try AFCEA chapter events, local GovCon meetups, and LinkedIn groups specifically for SDVOSB/8a contractors.\n\n  \n2. Partner with other small SDVOSB shops that do complementary work (cybersecurity, cloud infra, data analytics). You refer them your overflow, they refer you theirs. No salesperson needed for those deals, just relationship management.\n\n  \n3. If you want a dedicated seller, consider a hybrid: small base (even $2-3K/month) plus your commission structure. The base signals that you are serious and filters out the dreamers. The good ones will earn way more from commission anyway. $2-3K/month is cheap insurance against another wasted hire.\n\n  \n4. Your $100K average deal with $350K LTV is a strong story. Lead with that when recruiting. A salesperson closing even 3 deals a year at your structure would earn $30K+ in commissions plus recurring. Make sure your pitch to salespeople is as polished as your pitch to clients.\n\n  \nThe uncomfortable truth is that pure commission-only is a red flag for top sales talent because they have options. The people willing to work 100% commission with no base tend to be either very confident or very desperate, and the ratio skews toward the latter.",

The good ones already have established books of business and are not browsing job boards.\n\nWhat has worked for similar shops I know: instead of hiring salespeople, they turned their existing team into a sales channel. Engineers writing about their work, speaking at conferences, being active in communities where government procurement people and CTOs hang out. Slower but the close rate is dramatically higher because the buyer is talking to the person who will actually build their system.\n\nThe SDVOSB advantage is also worth leaning into harder. There are procurement officers who actively need to fill set-aside quotas. Building direct relationships with those specific people is often more productive than any cold outreach campaign.",

We burned money on sales and marketing employees. We burned money on agencies. We burned money on paid ads. Tried everything to make that type of business scale.\n\nHere's the truth:\nYou are trying to solve an equation that has no solution. Look at all the answers here.

It worked for us and I know plenty of companies where it worked too:\n\nYou need to fix your OFFER. \nYou can't just offer sw development as a service. Nobody cares, really. It provides questionable results, it is risky, it takes forever, it is never the primary solution for any given problem but often the most expensive one and if you fail, it can seriously damage the decision makers career. \n\n\"But I want to offer custom dev\"\nYes. It is absolutely possible to do so.\nBut you need to separate FULFILMENT from your VALUE PROPOSITION.\n\nSee, your customers will buy the following offer:\n\"We help (industry) to achieve (transformation) in (time span), as proven by (case study A, case study B).\"\n\nE.g. \"We help medical device manufacturers cut time to market by 30% by introducing a custom PLM solution based on ... as end-to-end backbone in 3-6 months\"\n\nThat's an actual example of a biz doing very well. \nIt is still 80% custom development in the background. But the value proposition and the target audience is crystal clear.\n\nAnd abacadabra, sales and marketing suddenly do work.\nAnd it gets even easier to find new customers using partners and referrals. \n\nHow to shift from generic dev shop to such a business?

Survived every framework war, every paradigm shift, every \"X is dead\" prediction.\n\nBut this one feels different.\n\nI spent my entire career getting good at something that's being commoditized in real time. The thing that used to take me weeks - someone with zero experience and an AI tool can ship a version of it in a weekend. Not a great version, but good enough to get users. Good enough to compete.\n\nAnd here's the timing irony: after two decades of building other people's products, I finally decided to go out on my own. Build something for myself. Be the founder, not the contractor.\n\nExcept now I'm launching into a market where the barrier to entry basically disappeared overnight. Every niche I research already has 15 AI-generated competitors. Every idea I validate has someone who shipped it last week using cursor and a vibe. The moat I spent 22 years building - deep technical expertise - is getting shallower by the month.\n\nThe fear is real. Not \"oh no AI will take my job\" fear. More like \"I waited too long and the game changed while I was warming up\" fear.\n\nWhat I'm learning (slowly) is that the 22 years aren't worthless - they're just worth something different now. Knowing what NOT to build is more valuable than being able to build anything. Understanding why systems fail matters more when everyone can make them work on demo day. And the experience of shipping real products to real users with real money on the line... that doesn't come from a weekend hackathon.\n\nBut I'd be lying if I said the doubt doesn't hit at 2am.\n\nAnyone else making the jump from senior dev to founder in this weird era?

It’s people that will do that. You just need to focus on the business aspect, even more than on building. If you want to turn build stuff into business, you have to be building solutions and company around them, not only tools. \n\nIf you feel like doing so, then do all you can to do it. Finger’s crossed!\n\nI know what I’m talking about. I founded my small company a while ago and am still in red numbers. But I’m slowly starting to understand my B2B customers and the market and thing are slowly improving.",

      "selftext": "Three of us started this company 18 months ago. Me, my buddy from college, and his wife. We run a social media content agency for DTC brands. Split equity equally because we all brought different skills. She handles creative direction and client communication. He does strategy and ops. I manage finances and new business.\n\nHit $18K/month last quarter. We have six retainer clients. The work is good and the timing feels right. Brands are desperate for consistent content and we deliver.\n\nExcept when we don't.\n\nAbout two months ago I started noticing something. When they have small arguments work just slows down. She'll be short in client calls or take longer to turn around revisions. Annoying but manageable.\n\nBut when they have a real fight she vanishes. No Slack response. Misses client meetings. Phone goes straight to voicemail. First time it happened I thought maybe she was sick. Covered a client presentation myself. She came back three days later like nothing happened.\n\nIt's happened four times now. Last one was six days. We had a major deliverable due for our biggest client and she just went dark. I ended up hiring a freelancer off Upwork at the last minute and staying up until 4am to art direct because I don't have her eye for this stuff. Client never knew but we barely made it.\n\nHe won't talk about it. Last time I brought it up he said she just needs to process things her own way and then changed the subject. I've tried asking if we should bring on someone to help with her workload and he gets defensive. Says I'm overreacting.\n\nI'm not overreacting. I'm watching my income depend on whether two people are getting along that week.\n\nWe're profitable and actually have a waitlist. The market is good right now. I don't want to walk away from something that's working.\n\nBut I can't keep doing this either. I've tried building backup systems. Looked at content generation tools like Midjourney, APOB, bunch of others. Doesn't work because clients hire us for a specific aesthetic. I've tried keeping freelancers on standby but that gets expensive and they don't know our clients like she does.\n\nEvery time my phone is quiet for more than a few hours I get this knot in my stomach. Is she just busy or is this another one? Should I cancel my plans this weekend just in case?\n\nTwo weeks ago I was sitting in my car after a client call and drafted a message about buyout options. Sat there staring at it for like twenty minutes. Deleted it. What if I'm bailing right before they figure it out? What if I'm the guy who gave up on something good because of a few rough months?\n\nBut also what if it gets worse and she disappears during something we actually can't recover from?\n\nSome days I think the revenue is worth it. Other days I just want out. And I have zero say in which version of them shows up to work.\n\nHas anyone stayed in a partnership that was making money but felt completely unstable?",

You don't need to mention anything about how she disappears or her work quality drops after their fights. You can bring up specific times when she went dark and you had to scramble to finish your deliverables, and ask if she needs support to make sure things don't fall off her radar. Alternatively, next time she drops the ball let her husband figure it out. As the finance and new biz guy you should not be responsible for communicating about BAU tasks with existing clients or covering for her. \n\nIf none of the above works, I'd think about exiting and looking for new cofounders that you can work with.",

That's a company running on adrenaline instead of structure. If her role is that critical then the business needs redundancy for that role regardless of who fills it. Document her processes, build a style guide detailed enough that a freelancer can match 80% of her output without you art directing at 4am.\n\nAnd the hardest part: you need to have the conversation with your buddy.

Something like \"we are growing, we have a waitlist, and we need a plan for when any one of us is unavailable for any reason.\" Make it about all three of you, not just her.\n\n  \n3. Propose a backup creative person on retainer now, while things are calm. Position it as scaling up to handle the waitlist, not as replacing her. If she pushes back on that, that tells you something important.\n\n  \n4. Stop deleting those buyout messages. Save them as drafts. Talk to a lawyer about what a structured buyout or equity restructure would look like so you have real numbers instead of anxiety spirals in your car.\n\n  \nThe fact that you are profitable with a waitlist means you have leverage right now.

This is completely normal and it's actually a sign you need to make your next hire an operations person, not another revenue-generating role.\n\nWe went through the same transition. The instinct is to keep hiring people who do the core work, but what actually unlocks your time is hiring someone whose entire job is managing the people stuff. Scheduling, time off, shift coverage, onboarding. All of it.\n\nThe math is simple: if you're spending 15-20 hours a week on employee management instead of growth activities, an ops manager at 50-60K pays for themselves almost immediately through the revenue you can now generate with that recovered time.\n\nShort term fix while you hire: give your most reliable employee at each location scheduling authority. They handle swaps and coverage, you only get involved for exceptions. It won't solve everything but it buys you back a few hours a week.",

You are past the point where you can keep it all in your head but probably not big enough to justify a full time ops person. That middle zone is brutal.\n\n  \nTwo things that helped me get out of this exact loop:\n\n  \nFirst, I stopped being the single point of contact for scheduling changes. Picked one reliable person at each location and made them the shift swap coordinator. They handle the day to day shuffles and only escalate to me if there is a conflict nobody can resolve. That alone cut my scheduling time by probably 60 percent. People still get their swaps handled, they just go through someone who is already on the floor and knows the context better than I do.\n\n  \nSecond, I set hard boundaries on when time off requests get processed. Instead of handling them as they came in throughout the day, I batch them. Every Monday morning I review anything that came in the previous week, approve or flag conflicts, done. The constant interruptions were what made it feel like a full time job, not the actual decision making which usually takes five minutes per request.\n\n  \nAt 22 people you are not doing something wrong. This is just the stage where you either build a system or slowly become an unpaid office manager. The good news is once you push some of that responsibility down, it actually runs smoother because the people closest to the work make better scheduling calls than you do sitting in a different room.",

I firgured they needed accountability. So, I had them send daily 5 minute report of what they were working, what’s their focus for the day, and what were they stuck or off track. Plus I needed them to start organizing their shifts themselves.\n\nThe second thing was that I end up hiring a remote virtual assistant in Latam through a company that GPT recommended. This staffing agency was called Hire With Near. It was game changing. Yep it cost me a bit at first but it was totally worth it. Instead of spending 60-70k having someone on-site or remote in the US this VA from Mexico was around ~20k a year.  But beyond saving time an each week I had most of the admin stuff handled. I was able to devote time to improving my sales pitch, improving our demand gen tools and just accelerating deals closed. Hope this if helpful in any way.",

They're completely different things. Building a company is a marathon. Nobody trains for a marathon by running every single day until their knees give out. You train smart, you rest on purpose, and you show up fresh when it counts. The guilt comes from thinking rest is the opposite of work, but it's actually part of the work.\n\nHere's what actually shifted things for me: I stopped treating rest as \"not working\" and started treating it as a responsibility. Your business needs you thinking clearly, not running on fumes making bad calls. I've made some of my worst decisions (wrong product decisions, misread documents) during stretches where I was \"grinding\" on 5 hours of sleep and zero downtime. Those mistakes cost way more than a Tuesday off ever would.\n\nThe guilt probably won't disappear entirely. But you can get to a point where you feel it and take the day anyway, because you know the version of you that comes back rested is worth more than the version that pushed through.",

ESPECIALLY when you are relying on yourself or others are relying on you. \n\nWhen you stop, your system reads time off as danger, not recovery, so it kicks up restlessness to push you back into motion.\n\nRest works best when your body and nervous system actually feel safe, not just when you are removing productivity. \n\nThis is exactly why I use nervous system resets.\n\nInstead of spending my days off focusing on work I \"should\" be doing according to my ADHD brain, I'm actually relaxing and enjoying them.",

Here's what finally helped me reframe it:\n\nYour business needs you to make good decisions more than it needs you to be constantly busy. And good decision-making requires a brain that isn't fried. When you're burned out, you're not actually being productive - you're just present. There's a huge difference.\n\nI started treating rest days like business investments. Would I skip maintaining equipment because I'm too busy using it? No, because it would break. Your brain is your primary business tool.\n\nWhat worked for me:\n\n1. Schedule days off in advance, not when you're already exhausted. Put them on the calendar like client meetings. It's easier to take a day off when it's planned than when you wake up and decide that day.\n\n2. Define what a good rest day looks like FOR YOU. For me, it's not lying on the couch feeling guilty. It's doing something active that's not work - hiking, reading, building something with my hands. The physical activity actually helps more than passive rest.\n\n3. Track your output before and after rest days. I noticed my best work weeks almost always came after I took a real day off. The quality of thinking was just better.\n\n4. Remember that your competitors burning themselves out isn't an advantage for them - it's a vulnerability. The business that can sustain its pace wins, not the one that sprints until it collapses.\n\nThe restless feeling during time off? That fades once you prove to yourself that taking breaks doesn't derail everything. The first few times are the hardest.",

      "selftext": "To put it short - stop believing everything you see on the internet.\n\nLately it feels like every other reel on Instagram is some guy screen-recording a “live” Shopify or Stripe dashboard selling a course. Same angle. Same cursor hovering over revenue. Same refresh button. Same captions about quitting your job.\n\nOne in particular kept popping up on my feed. Young guy, rented Airbnb background, MacBook on the table, showing what looked like steady five-figure days. I wasn’t even mad about it. I’ve been in dropshipping long enough to know big days happen.\n\nI probably wouldn’t have thought twice about it if I hadn’t paused the video at the wrong time.\n\nWhen he refreshed the dashboard, the numbers updated and for a split second there were two dollar signs in front of the revenue. Most likely a typo. One slightly offset. It disappeared almost immediately when the animation finished. You wouldn’t notice it unless you scrubbed through the video frame by frame.\n\nSo I did.\n\nI replayed it a few times and it kept happening. The extra symbol showed up for a fraction of a second and then corrected itself. It didn’t look like lag.\n\nInstead of commenting publicly, I DMed him. Acted interested. Asked about the course, the usual questions. He replied quickly, sent voice notes, told me spots were filling up, as every guru does i guess.\n\nAfter a few messages, I sent him a screenshot from his own reel with the duplicate dollar sign circled and just asked what that was.\n\nHe responded saying they had a collaboration with a platform that lets them simulate dashboards for marketing. Said it helps make content cleaner and even sent a signup link to the same platform he was FAKING it all on. Said the real business is separate from what’s shown in videos.\n\nJust so you understand the size of this problem - there's probs way more affiliates, way more gurus who are selling you courses that don't even know how to do the thing they're selling.\n\nI know how bad it sometimes feels when your sales are slow and then you see a 19 year old kid flexing lambos and multi-million revenue on Instagram. I'm asking you to stop believing it.\n\nNow whenever I see those “flexing” videos, I can't help myself but to analyse every single detail of the video lol.\n\nEDIT: My DM's are being flooded by people asking what the tool name is. I do not condone this and for those who are asking in regards to \"research purposes\" the tool is is dashmock or mockdash, I can't quite recall due to archiving the conversation with the influencer and I am not affiliated with it in any shape or form.",

It’s the obsession with looking successful to trigger other people's FOMO, rather than building a business that actually generates cash.

But in the real world, the ice is cold and the friction is real. If you don't have a **Structure** that handles real customer data, real logistics, and real margins, you don't have a startup; you have a video edit.\n\nReal entrepreneurs don't flaunt dashboards; they obsess over **Operational Validation**.

Something boring that solves a real problem and people already pay for. Local lead gen, short form content for businesses, email marketing for small ecom brands, that kind of thing. You do not need capital for that, just skill and relentless outreach.\n\nEveryone wants leverage before they’ve earned it. Leverage comes after you can consistently sell. So step one would be learn how to sell. Cold outreach, follow ups, handling objections, closing on Zoom. It’s uncomfortable but that’s where the money is. You can make 3k to 5k per month way faster with a service than trying to build the next big SaaS from zero. I’ve seen people burn 12 months building something nobody asked for. Painful.\n\nThen once cash flow is stable, I’d build distribution. Newsletter, Twitter, maybe YouTube. Not for ego, but to own attention. Attention compounds. You post consistently for a year and suddenly doors open. Weird how that works. It’s boring at first. Feels like shouting into the void. But that’s the tax.\n\nSo yeah. Service for cash. Sales skill for survival. Distribution for leverage. Then product later when you actually understand the market.\n\nIf you’re into building real wealth from zero and not just dreaming about it, I write about that journey weekly in Wealth Rewired. It’s all practical stuff, no guru nonsense.",

Go to Upwork, cold DM small businesses on Twitter/LinkedIn, offer to do one project at a steep discount to get a testimonial.\n\n  \nMonth 1-2: Stack 3-5 testimonials. Raise your rate. Start noticing what clients keep asking for that you could productize. This is where the real ideas come from, not from brainstorming in a vacuum but from actual client conversations.\n\n  \nMonth 3+: Take the most repeated request and turn it into a small productized service or simple tool. Now you have income, proof of demand, and your first few customers already lined up.\n\n  \nThe AI angle here is real but overblown. The advantage isn't \"build an AI startup.\" The advantage is that AI lets one person do the work of three. A freelance copywriter using AI well can take on 3x the volume. A developer can ship MVPs in days instead of weeks. That's the actual leverage, using AI to amplify a service business, not trying to compete in the AI product space with zero runway.\n\n  \nBiggest mistake I see people make is skipping straight to \"build a SaaS\" when they have no income, no network, and no understanding of what people actually pay for.

Actually talking to 50 people who run small businesses or SaaS companies and asking \"what is the most painful repetitive thing you do every week?\"\n\nThe answer in 2026 almost certainly involves AI automation. But not the way most people think. It is not \"build another AI wrapper.\" It is \"find a 500 dollar per month manual process and automate 80 percent of it with existing AI tools.\" Sell that as a service before you build a product.\n\nBiggest advantage of starting from zero in 2026 vs 2020: the cost to build has dropped 10x. A SaaS that took 50k and 6 months can now ship for under 500 dollars in a few weeks. But that also means competition is brutal, so distribution matters more than ever.\n\nFastest path: skill leads to income leads to problem discovery leads to service leads to productize.

Start a landscaping or pressure washing business, you can do all the work yourself and the tools can be found cheap on Facebook marketplace. Knock on doors and get a few customers.

I have a friend who started a software company to help solve a problem in recycling that he saw on an internship he had in college. He turned that into the multi-million dollar business that he runs today. He was already studying software engineering, so he was able to build it all himself with a couple friends.

While this is important, there are other factors \n\nHere are some of the topics I had to learn the \"hard way\" and wish I had learned prior to opening my first business:\n\n* Financial management: Understand your costs, but be prepared for many more costs than you expect! There will be fees and taxes you can't always plan for. \n   * Understand what the bottom line profit is as it can often be less than estimated to begin with.\n   * Recognize cash flow is critical and many profitable businesses fail when they run out of cash.\n   * Bookkeeping and accounting is hard to learn and time consuming, but is required to know where your business is at to make good decesions.\n   * Taxes are both required and can ruin a business if not paid. Always plan for and pay the required taxes.\n* Operations and Systems: This is how the daily work gets done and good processes and operations can be the difference between unpredictable problems and out of your control.\n   * SOPs are the documented steps to do any business.\n   * Supply chain is the raw materials or tools needed.\n   * Quality control is critical as poor products or services will mean unhappy customers, bad reviews, and the business failing.\n* Marketing and Sales: How the business will become known and gain customers.\n   * Marketing is building awareness of the business.\n   * Sales is the process of converting someone interested into a paying customer.\n   * Customer retention is the methods by which you keep customers for repeat business.\n* Legal and Compliance: Boring but essential as this ensures you and the business are protected and following the law.\n   * Structure might be an LLC or Corp or other which depends on how you are taxed and the level of personal liability you have.\n   * Licenses and permits required to operate the business in good standing.\n   * Contracts and warranties that are clear written agreements with customer, partners, employees and vendors. \n\nUnderstand each of these as you build a business plan around them to be prepared to start whatever business you decide on.\n\nNote that these are scalable as they all apply to the smallest of businesses through the largest.",

In reality it starts with being around problems long enough that ideas basically annoy you into existence lol.\n\nAt 20 your biggest advantage is that you can run low-stakes experiments and no one expects you to be perfect yet.\n\nIf I were starting from zero, I’d focus on:\n\n**1. Getting close to how money actually moves**  \nWork somewhere small. Startup, local business, freelance gigs, student org that sells something. Basically, anything where you can see how customers show up and how messy operations are. Business isn’t abstract. It’s literally: people have a problem → someone fixes it → money happens.\n\n**2. Pick one REAL skill that makes you useful**  \nSales, marketing, editing, design, social media, writing, basic tech stuff. Things that helps someone earn or save money. When you’re useful AND quick, people pull you into opportunities.\n\n**3. Talk to people who are building stuff**  \nAsk what’s hard, what breaks, what wastes time.\n\nEvery business is just a solution to a recurring annoyance. The more conversations you have, the more patterns you start noticing. That’s where most ideas come from.\n\nMost beginners are stuck because they’re waiting for clarity before taking action. Clarity comes *after* reps, not before. You just need to put yourself in rooms where problems are visible and the “idea” phase becomes obvious.",

Learn sales, basic digital marketing, or how to build something (code, design, or a physical trade). You can't lead a team if you don't understand the work.\n2. **The Friction List:** for one week, write down every time you (or people around you) say 'I wish this was easier' or 'Why does this take so long?'. Those aren't just complaints; they are market gaps.\n3. **The 'Day-to-Day' Reality:** business isn't about vision boards. It’s about 80% admin, customer service, and solving small problems, and 20% growth. Start a 'micro-business' this weekend, sell a service on a freelance platform or flip an item. The goal isn't profit; it's learning how a transaction actually works.\n\nDon't wait for a grand vision. Find a small problem, solve it for one person, and charge for it. That is the only real 'Step One'.\n\nWhat is one skill you already have that someone might pay $20 for right now?",

If they're cobbling together spreadsheets, emailing themselves reminders, or paying for some clunky workaround, that's real signal. If they just nod and say \"yeah that sounds cool,\" that's politeness, not validation.\n\nThe other expensive lesson I learned: the MVP doesn't need to be software. We've shipped validation tests with landing pages, manual processes behind the scenes, and even just a well-written email describing the solution. If people won't engage with a rough version, they definitely won't engage with a polished one. Glad you came out the other side with something profitable. That second run is always sharper.",

          "body": "I am starting my journey too \n\nI wasn’t always confident.\n I’ve been shy for most of my life. I turned 18 last December, and the person I am today is the result of a series of experiences that shaped how I think, work, and make decisions.\nAs a child, I was mischievous. My parents worried about where that energy would take me, so they sent me to a hostel for my development. That decision changed my life. Living away from home at a young age forced me to learn how to survive on my own, how to socialize, and how systems work when you’re not protected by comfort.\nThe hostel environment exposed me to power dynamics early. Bullying existed. Seniors used power for entertainment. We were forced into situations where we had to fight our own friends or do things just to avoid being targeted. It showed me how fragile people can be under pressure, and how easily power can be misused. Those years taught me how authority works in the real world and what kind of authority I never want to become.\nI stayed in the hostel from Class 3 to Class 5. When I returned home in Class 6, I realized I didn’t think like most people my age. My thinking patterns were different. My maturity didn’t match my age group. That gap stayed with me.\nThen the pandemic hit, and with it came one of the hardest phases of my life. I lost my grandmother without being there to see her for the last time. I had the option to go, but I chose differently. That decision left me with guilt I still carry. The weight of that period pushed me into isolation. I escaped into online games and distractions, trying not to sit with what I was feeling.\nAfter lockdown, I joined another hostel for a new school. This time, I was the senior. The difference was simple. I did not repeat what was done to me. I chose not to use power the way I had experienced it. I focused on helping juniors in studies, decision making, and personal growth. That was the first time I consciously decided the kind of leader I wanted to become.\nThat phase is where my self development started seriously. I began exercising. I started reading. The first book I picked up was Atomic Habits, and it changed how I approached my life. I went from nearly failing to becoming a top three student. By Class 10, I had read extensively on psychology, communication, and business. I was actively working on my mindset, discipline, and character.\nClass 10 was also when I discovered entrepreneurship properly. Before that, I thought entrepreneurship only meant building big companies. Watching Iman Ghazi’s self development content became a turning point. In hostel, we only had phone access twice a week. I used that time to study his content and spent the rest of the week applying what I learned. I could see real changes in how I thought and acted. Later, I learned he was running a business. That is when I realized building something of your own was not just about companies. It was about ownership over your life.\nAfter Class 10, I returned home for Classes 11 and 12. That phase was unstable. Poor choices and lack of discipline led to wasted time. I went from being a top three student to losing consistency. My boards are now just days away. I do not feel fully prepared, but I will get through them.\nWhat has not changed is clarity about my potential. After my boards, I am moving out. Not for college, but to build. I have saved enough to support myself for one year. That one year is fully dedicated to starting my own venture. This is not impulsive. I have been thinking about this path for years. It is a new beginning, and while there is fear, there is also certainty about what needs to be done.\nI am not chasing money for the sake of it. I have been clear about my field for around four years now. I am serious about the work. I do not come from privilege. I come from a lower middle class family. My father’s job is enough to sustain a living. Nothing more, nothing less. I do not have a safety net of cafes, luxury setups, or lifestyle content before success. I have discipline, clarity, and the willingness to build from zero.\nCollege and a job are common paths. They are not the only ones. I am choosing to try building something of my own. This is my bet on myself.",

People say yes to be polite. Instead I started asking \"walk me through the last time you dealt with \\[problem\\]\" and just listening.

          "body": "Painful lesson but one most of us learn the hard way at least once.\n\n  \nFew things that helped me stop giving away free work:\n\n  \n1. Ask upfront: \"Is there an internal team involved in this project?\" Not confrontational, just standard discovery. Their answer (or dodge) tells you a lot.\n\n  \n2. Replace free demos with paid discovery. Even a small paid phase ($500-1500 depending on scope) filters out everyone who is not serious. Real buyers are happy to pay for it because they get value either way. Time-wasters disappear instantly.\n\n  \n3. If they push back on paid discovery, offer a short presentation or walkthrough of similar past work instead. Never custom-build anything before money changes hands.\n\n  \n4. \"Show us what you can do\" without any commitment from their side = free consulting. A legit client will have a budget, a timeline, and a decision-maker on the call. If any of those three are missing, be cautious.\n\n  \n5. Set a personal rule: no more than 2-3 hours of unpaid work before any engagement. That is enough for a proposal and a rough wireframe, not a full week of building.\n\n  \nThe silver lining is that once you start charging for discovery, the quality of your leads goes way up. The people who stay in the conversation after hearing \"paid discovery\" are almost always the ones who actually close.",

What types of products or services are they likely to be using? Now, look for the people that sell that. Get to know them and their business and find out what other events they go to. The idea is to leave an impression and keep yourself fresh in their mind.

When I go to networking events, these are the people that I try to talk to the most.

      "selftext": "I opened my dermatology practice 18 months ago. Things are going well, too well, actually. I went from 12 patients a day to 28 in a year and a half. The problem is my overhead has scaled way faster than my revenue. I started with one front desk person and one MA. I’ve now added a second MA and a billing coordinator, and I still need more help. My monthly payroll went from $8K to $22K, and when you add benefits, payroll taxes, and workers’ comp, I’m spending close to $30K/month on staff for a practice that’s netting $35K.\n\nThe bottleneck right now is admin. My front desk person is juggling phones, patient intake, appointment scheduling, referral coordination, and prior authorizations for procedures. She’s great but she’s one person doing a three-person job, and things are slipping: missed prior auths that delay procedures, phone calls going to voicemail, patients waiting 15 minutes just to check in. I know it’s hurting the patient experience.\n\nI’ve been doing the math on hiring a second front desk person and it’s brutal, $38–$42K salary plus $8–10K in benefits and taxes. That’s another $50K annual commitment when I’m barely keeping margins healthy. A friend who owns an urgent care told me he uses remote medical assistants from overseas who are HIPAA-trained and cost around $9–10/hour with no benefits overhead. He says they handle his phones, scheduling, and insurance verifications.\n\nI’m skeptical but intrigued. For any small practice owners who’ve used virtual medical assistants to scale: how did you handle the transition? Did patients notice or care that the person answering the phone was remote? And how do you manage someone who isn’t physically in the office? I need to grow my team without destroying the margins that make this practice viable.",

Your patient experience is going to be much better by adding the $7/visit the additional admin person would cost, vs going with an overseas option.\n\nEdit: another thought.

          "body": "It is all about PAs. They are “cheap” and can handle the medical derm while you focus on the more profitable cosmetic patient. You also need to convert the medical derm patients into cosmetic patients. The big chain groups in my area probably have 10 PAs to every MD/DO. A lot of their offices only have PAs in them. You can hire three to four PAs or one Doctor for the same money. Three PAs can see 3x the amount of patients as one Doctor can.\n\nMAs are also cheaper than Nurses and can do most of the things a Nurse can in a Derm office. It is rare for a Nurse to be in a Derm office, unless it is an NP who is seeing patients and billing.\n\nYou also need to increase your volume. 28 patients per day is a comfortable pace. Again, the large offices in my area are seeing 60+ per providers in a 10 hour day. You might not want to see that many as it can detract from the quality of care, but shooting for 45 per day is probably a good place to be.\n\nLastly, having an experienced biller and prior auth person is worth their weight in gold. They can ensure you are billing insurances the proper amount and patients are getting the medicines you want them to have.\n\n  \nEdit: Additional ways to increase revenue: there are companies that will give you compounding machines. They are kind of like Nespresso machines, but you can direct sell acne, rosacea etc… treatments to your patients. IDK the exact pricing, but it’s something like $20 per and then you sell it for $40. No insurance or pharmacy are involved and the patient gets the product right in your office. \n\nyou should also be selling your preferred skin care line in your office, like skinceuticals. Or you can create your own with white labeling.",

          "body": "Yeah, you’re not alone. The espresso machine thing is basically a rite of passage. Every small business owner has some version of “the one piece of equipment that knows exactly when to die for maximum damage.”\n\nThe part that nobody warns you about is how much of the job is just… maintenance. Not the creative stuff, not the reason you started. Just keeping the machine running (literally and figuratively). Payroll, permits, suppliers changing prices, a key employee calling in sick on your busiest day. It compounds.\n\nThe paperwork thing is real too. You open a coffee shop because you love coffee and community, and then you spend half your time in spreadsheets tracking beans and milk margins.\n\nTwo things worth saying though. First, the fact that you’ve kept it going for a couple of years already puts you ahead of most. The majority of coffee shops don’t make it past 18 months. You’re past the survival phase even if it doesn’t feel like it.\n\nSecond, if the “should I just get an office job” thought is showing up a lot, it’s worth taking seriously. Not as a sign to quit, but as a signal that something in the operation needs to change. Usually it means you’re doing too much yourself. The owners who last are the ones who eventually find a way to stop being the person who has to handle every crisis personally. That might mean a strong second-in-command, or systems that reduce the daily firefighting, or just cutting the parts of the business that drain you the most for the least return.\n\nBut also, some days just suck and the espresso machine breaks and you’re allowed to be annoyed about it.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

I run a different kind of business but that feeling of drowning in admin while the actual work piles up is universal.\n\nTwo things that helped me get some sanity back:\n\n1. I automated the repetitive stuff. Inventory tracking, order reminders, basic customer follow-ups. None of it needs a human brain, it just needs to happen consistently. Once I stopped doing it manually I got like 10 hours a week back.\n\n2. For the customer side, I set up a simple system that handles the FAQ stuff automatically. People asking hours, menu, catering options (or whatever the equivalent is for your shop) without you having to personally respond to every single one.\n\nThe espresso machine thing though, no automation fixes that. That's just the universe testing you.\n\nTwo years in and still running means you're doing something right. The owners who quit usually do it in the first year.",

Most customers will have no problem waiting a couple of days for a reliable pickup.\n\nSecond, limit the number of places you can be contacted. One text or messaging point of contact and one phone number is plenty. If a customer contacts you through another channel, you can just copy and paste a standard message advising them you only take requests through specific platforms.\n\nThird, immediately put all scheduled pickups into a calendar app and set reminder notifications if needed so you won't forget. If you want to get fancy, you can even have customers book their pickups online and have those bookings go directly into your calendar.\n\nJust because it's a side hustle doesn't mean it can be disorganized.

Confirm?\"\nCopy/paste. Takes 30 seconds. No decisions.\n\n\n**3. The calendar block**\nDon't just put \"dump run\" on your calendar. Block \"Drive + load + landfill\" as one chunk. I learned that 3 \"quick jobs\" = 4 hours, not 90 minutes.\n\n\nAt 3-4 jobs/day, you don't need enterprise software. You need 3 repeatable steps so your brain stops juggling.\n\n\nWhen you hit 8-10 jobs/day, *then* look at tools.

That person calling you right now is already dialing the next hauler on Google by the time you see the missed call.\n\nTwo things that fix this without adding overhead:\n\n1. Auto text-back on missed calls. Most business phone apps handle this - OpenPhone, Google Voice, even some carrier features. Someone calls, you can not answer, they get an instant text: \"Hey, on a job right now. What do you need hauled and what is your zip?\" Now they are in a conversation with you instead of moving on to your competitor.\n\n2. Stop quoting live over the phone. Send everyone a standard message: \"Shoot me a photo of what needs hauled and your address, I will get you a price within the hour.\" Batch your quoting into 15 minutes at the end of each work block instead of getting pulled out of work constantly.\n\nThe operators I have watched go from one trailer to three did not get there by working harder. They got there by making sure every lead that came in actually converted to a booked job. Right now you are probably losing 40-50% of people who reach out - not because they said no to your price, but because they called someone who picked up.",

Intake process: When someone calls/texts, you say “Got it, let me confirm via text so we both have it in writing” - then you text them the details. This forces everything into ONE channel (text) and creates a paper trail.\n3. Auto-response template: “Job confirmed for [date/time/location]. I’ll text you 30 min before I’m on my way. Landfill closes at 5pm so pickup needs to be by 4pm latest.”\nSet boundaries NOW before you burn out. You almost missed a deadline because you stacked jobs wrong - that’s not sustainable.\nWhere are you getting stuck - the tool setup or the process change?",

The dilemma occurs when you know that you should be focusing on setting up systems or strategic planning but never having the time to do so because we are constantly stuck in the rut. \n\nWhen we hire, we find that person hired might not be a good fit and we have to let go of the person. We question our judgement and also lament about the \"wasted\" money spent hiring the \"wrong\" person. \n\nWhat I learnt 4 years into this role is that hiring the right person really matters (a point mentioned in the book Good to Great - get the right person on board). \nHaving the right person will allow you to delegate once they have been trained and that frees us to do the things that matters and can be done only by us. I have always hired on desperation and wanted the candidate more than they wanted to job and was always placed at a disadvantage.",

You are definitely not alone in that.\n\nMost small business owners I know go through this phase where you are wearing every hat at once, especially in the early stages. It can feel empowering one day and completely overwhelming the next, sometimes within the same afternoon.\n\nFor me, the hardest part has usually been context switching. Jumping from doing actual work, to answering emails, to worrying about money, to trying to plan the future all in one day drains you fast. It is not that any single task is impossible, it is the constant mental load.\n\nWhat helped a bit over time was accepting that this stage is normal, but also temporary. Even small changes like automating one task or clearly deciding what does not matter yet can reduce the pressure.\n\nWhat part of the business is taking the most energy from you right now?",

The finance/numbers side is usually what drains people the most because you can't really ignore it but it also takes forever to understand what's actually happening with your money.

Usually financial clarity is up there becuase bad decisions compound fast when you're guessing. If the accounting/CFO side is eating at you, came across AsteroCFO .Ai recently which gives you AI-powered financial analysis you can actually ask questions to in plain English for like $397/mo.\n\nWay cheaper than hiring and you get answers right away instead of waiting on your accountant to email back three days later.",

And then an hour for marketing/sales. I then have a few hours for meetings. And then I reserve the end of the day, 2 hours for focused work, for me that means making products. Go home, be with family for dinner, read to the kids or sing songs or dance or do yoga with them. And then I get back to work from 8-10, maybe 11. This is usually exploratory or experimental work, testing new ideas. It feels more like fun, so I like doing it at night.\n\n(Kind of shameful plug).

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, this is my first Reddit post, so I apologize if it’s a little rough.\n\nI'm 25 M and I’ve learned a ton from this community and really respect the advice that gets shared here. Now I’m the one who needs help.\n\nI own a small business that I started and fully funded myself. I own 100% of it. I do everything — the work, bookkeeping, taxes, invoicing, customer relations — all of it. and I've been in business for over 2 years\n\nWhen I first started, things were manageable. I paid for materials, tools, and consumables in cash. No loans, no credit cards, no investors, no debt. It felt safe and controlled.\n\nBut as the months went on, the business kept growing. Bigger clients came in. I moved into B2B work with net 30 terms. At first, I was balancing that with smaller cash-paying jobs, which helped with flow.\n\nNow I’m almost strictly B2B. Dee to me not having any physical time for the smaller intricate jobs that takes 6 hours to complete.\n\nAnd my cash flow is terrible.\n\nOn paper, I’m growing every month. I have recurring clients. Work keeps increasing. But because of net 30 terms, I’m constantly waiting to get paid while needing to buy materials for the next round of jobs. I’ve gotten to the point where I’m worried I won’t be able to afford next month’s materials — even though I have the work lined up.\n\nI’ve tried loans which i cant get approved due to my credit and being high risk and grants, but most “grant” programs I find just want fees to “move my application forward,” which feels sketchy. I don’t want to bury myself in bad debt.\n\nThis situation has stressed me to the point of mental exhaustion. I’ve honestly thought about shutting everything down just to relieve the pressure — even though I know the business is growing and has real potential. It feels like I’m growing too fast and I can’t keep up financially.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with rapid growth creating cash flow problems like this?\n\nHow do you manage net 30 clients without constantly feeling underwater?\n\nI don’t want to quit. I just don’t know how to stabilize this.\n\nAny advice would mean a lot.",

          "body": "I have been exactly here. What you were dealing with is very normal, and when entrepreneurs are able to navigate this successfully, it’s the difference between a successful company and one that goes bankrupt \n\nNet profitability usually is not what kills a business, usually it is cash flow.\n\nI’ll start by saying, Don’t listen to the people that say “don’t accept net 30 terms”. Those people don’t understand the world and industry that you deal with. Unfortunately, in certain industries, the client sets the terms. We are playing in their world. We can decide to play with them, but that’s simply the way it is. Everything has pros and cons. The benefit to these commercial clients is that they are higher volume, higher value jobs. And usually less time spent/higher margins. The con is that they’re usually net 30+.\n\nSo yes, you can decide to not accept net 30 terms, but now you’re working with a different business model. I’m going to assume you excel in this field and have carved a niche, it is a TOTALLY acceptable business model. \n\nIn 2025, we were 48% commercial and 52% residential. Residential has its headaches, but we still show it a lot of attention and are constantly going after residential jobs, because it’s quick cash. This is what makes payroll. This is what keeps cash in the account when our account receivable is 150 K. Without it, inevitably, we would come to a place where we are borrowing high interest debt to make payroll. That’s not what we want to do.\n\nIf residential simply isn’t an option for you, and there’s absolutely no way for you to get any money down on maybe larger projects on the commercial side, you have to be very careful at how fast you “grow”. In a business with a quick cash conversion cycle, this isn’t as much of a problem. \n\n1. I would recommend firstly finding all the ways you can decrease the overall cash conversion cycle. The first thing you can do is look at every single outgoing payment that you make monthly, and find a way to push those payments off so that the money isn’t taken out of your account 30+ days, or as long as possible.\n\nFor example, we put everything on credit cards. We know that cash isn’t due until at least 30 days from the statement close.\n\nWe have negotiated with all vendors to try to push back payments as late as possible. Sometimes it’s possible and sometimes it’s not. But that is always our goal, to push that outgoing cash as late as possible. \n\nBe very, very careful here, this is where financial discipline comes into play. This is where people get into loads of bad debt. You have to know what’s coming in, when it’s coming in, what you can float, Spreadsheets are your best friend. Don’t sleep on this part, it is VERY important. When this first started to become an issue this bought us almost 30 days for a/r to improve before we had to make those usual payments. It helped us get ahead of the curve and if you haven’t done this yet DO IT. \n\n2. Now you have to figure out how to decrease the cash conversion cycle even more based on income. Is there any possible way to get down payments, can you do more residential, factoring (in extreme case), but you get the idea.\n\n3. Monitor monito monitor monitor. Hire somebody to be in charge of your account receivable. This is a full-time job for us. Do absolutely everything you can to stay on these people. In the commercial world, putting liens on things, this is standard practice. They don’t take it personally, all it does is make you become one of the first people that they pay. We send a letter of intense often, and quiet, we are still working with to this day. We’ve never lost a commercial client by sending a letter of intent. All it does is make sure that it gets to the owner.\n\nHit me up sometime if you ever want to discuss this! There are a lot of things that you can do, but you have to be incredibly intentional",

A bank can give you the liquid cash a day or two after you ship (90%, with the other 10% released when your customer pays). You basically have a rolling loan with the bank, but because it's secured (against your invoices) you get lower interest payments than you would if you used an overdraft etc. \nYou can insure the invoices, so if a customer goes bankrupt and cannot pay, you are insured. Otherwise if you're not insured and that happens, you immediately owe the bank the unpaid value. Depends on how stable your customers are.\nDownsides are it can be hard to get off the cashflow train &amp; it becomes a bit of a dependency &amp; you are essentially always borrowing something, so you'll end up paying a bit over they year.

Avoid taking loans or using credit cards for the business until you complete #2 below.\n\n2. Find a professional accountant (this may be difficult during tax season). Ask them to review your books thoroughly. Have them analyze your Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L), Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement. If your balance sheet shows structural issues, your business model may be failing. Numbers do not lie.\n\n3. Review all Net 30 customers carefully. If customers exceed payment terms, your credit control process may be ineffective. Ideally, receivables should not go past due — even by one day.\n\n4. Sit down and evaluate 2–3 projects based on gross profit. Determine whether your margins truly cover the cost of capital. As a basic benchmark, if your profit does not exceed approximately 12%, your net return may not justify the risk. This may sound aggressive, but a business must outperform low-risk financial alternatives(Fix CD/ US Bonds). If you cannot outperform safer investment , your strategy may involve high risk with insufficient return. This is a fundamental business principle.\n\n5. Open a separate business account at the same bank. Transfer net profit into that account every time you receive payment. Do not use those funds until you have completed #2.\n\n6. Do not sign leases or long-term contracts until #2 has been completed.\n\n  \n",

Rapid growth is a good problem to have, but it can definitely feel overwhelming when cash flow doesn’t match the workload.\n\nA few things you might consider:\n\t1.\tBusiness credit or line of credit – Even a small credit line can bridge the gap between invoices and expenses. It gives you breathing room without relying on loans with bad terms.\n\t2.\tOutsource non-core tasks – Bookkeeping, invoicing, or even customer follow-ups can be handled by someone else. That frees you to focus on the work that actually brings in revenue.\n\t3.\tSegment your clients – Keep some smaller, quick-turnaround jobs that pay cash to maintain positive cash flow. Maybe hire someone part-time to handle these jobs, so you can focus on the bigger B2B contracts without sinking into a cash crunch.\n\t4.\tInvoice strategy – I know others already covered this but you can offer small incentives for early payment, or split larger invoices into smaller milestones to reduce the net 30 waiting period. Even partial upfront payment helps cover materials.\n\nHope sone of this helps and wish you the best!",

The majority of the time isn't actually doing the work you like to do, it's handling inventory, legal compliance, marketing, sales, and all the other stuff that needs to be done around the actual things your business does.\n\n2. To quote a comedian \"Do you think a crackhead wakes up and just says they're too tired to go get crack today? No! So don't let a crackhead out hustle you\". \n\n3. I argue this is the important one, shut up and listen to people and ask questions about them and their problems. Most people don't care too much about your half an hour sales pitch. Obviously tell them what you're offering but shut up and understand their problems and how you're uniquely qualified to address their problems. I've lost jobs by not taking a minute and understanding my client and I've won customers over by shutting up and listening.\n\nBonus insight: Don't get hung up on the sale you didn't close or customer whom didn't buy. Take a second and see what you could have done to be better and move on. You're gonna fail but you should be marketing enough that there's two more coming behind him to sell to and not everyone is your customer. \n\nHope this helps someone.",

If everything works out ill have the buyout payment recovered in 6 months and back to profitability by q3.\n\nVenting here. Business partner for the past 5 years has up and quit. Demanded an insane payout, which was denied due to valuation not supporting it. Have countered with an offer that is grounded a bit more in reality while taking into account the massive risk I will be taking on as a solo venture. He's been less than pleasant about the whole ordeal, and has decided to just stop participating in operations while the payout is negotiated. A bit overwhelmed at the moment, mostly the books, as it has been his task to manage over the years. During the valuation, I discovered drastically inflated inventory assets and cash holdings. Have crawled the books trying to get everything proper but it's so overwhelming. How do you solo acts do it? Very impressive for single owner businesses to work, especially at the ground floor. I imagine in a year when I have more systems set up to support me and the business, it won't feel so catastrophic, but man, at the moment it's very intimidating and exhausting to even keep my head above water. Will be scaling back the entire business ad essentially rebuilding it brick by brick, this time without ay fuzzy back end details.

The bookkeeping chaos is the worst part when a partner who \"handled the numbers\" leaves - you suddenly realize you have no idea what's actually happening in your own business.\n\nTwo practical things that helped me:\n\n1. Get a part-time bookkeeper ASAP, even if just for 10 hours to untangle everything. Way cheaper than the stress and mistakes you'll make trying to learn it from scratch during a crisis.\n\n2. Document every single process as you rebuild. When you're a solo operator, your systems ARE your business. Write down how you invoice, how you track inventory, how you do payroll - future you will thank you, and it makes hiring easier when you're ready.\n\nThe panic attacks suck but they'll fade once you have visibility into your own numbers. You've got 5 years of customers and 65k/month - that foundation is real. The backend mess is fixable.",

Passwords, processes, client contacts. If your partner has info you need, get it before things get worse.\n\n2. Talk to a lawyer before making big moves. Even a 30-min consultation can save you months of pain later.\n\n3. Assess if the business is viable solo. Sometimes the answer is no, and thats OK. Better to know early.\n\n4. Reach out to your clients directly. Transparency builds trust. Let them know whats happening (at a high level) and that youre committed.\n\nThe emotional part is real too. Losing a business partner feels like a breakup. Give yourself space to process it while still protecting the business.\n\nI write about these founder challenges in my newsletter if you want more tactical stuff: https://substack.com/@francoisdelpte",

Better guest experience, smoother curbside movement, fewer headaches during peak checkout/checkin, maybe fewer damage claims or disputes. But I’m trying to understand if the ROI is actually there in real life. For anyone who’s had to make this case before, what arguments actually landed with ownership?

We use PUR Valet, but there are a lot of other options out there. What mattered was whether the system helped keep hotel standards high while cutting down on unnecessary work.

          "body": "&gt; maybe fewer damage claims or disputes.\n\nWhere have you heard this.  I have no insider knowledge but everything I've heard is the opposite and that is common sense IMO.   More touch points more liability.\n\nIn general to your question I would ask back, \"Do you?\"\n\nFirst is this something your guests even want or would use let alone expect.  If price is a major selling point they are not going to want to do it just for tip reasons. \n\nAlso consider the groups who wont use it and what percentage of the guests they make up.   People with nicer cars often won't use valet for obvious reasons.  Business travelers often won't because they don't want to waste time waiting for the car.  And people with rentals may not because of rental agreement rules or fears of damage.  etc etc\n\nSecond consider the costs.  You will need this 24/7 or at least a way for the people to get their cars.   Would having an extra one or two staff members working at all times hurt profit?  (And is that even the best use of extra staff?)   How about the the insurance costs?  Sure you could simply hire a company to provide these workers and the insurance but of course that will likely cost similar if not more vs direct hires.  \n\nThird consider the headaches vs peak check in vs check out.  Part of why business travelers wont use it.  As people are waiting for their cars to be moved/brought up.   Sure it is bad now but would it be better?   \n\nAnd now instead of them blaming some other guest they blame you directly.   \n\nSure it may avoid some idiot leaving their car up front while they take their bags up and spend 30 mins in their room before parking.   But will they actual use the valet or is that just a car making the valet service worse?  \n\nAnd if that is an issue there are other options to consider to combat it like signage and staff training.  \n\nIn the end IMO if a hotel doesn't already have valet they likely are not in the right market segment to add it.  People know at least subconsciously they are paying more to get more.  They are not expecting or wanting to pay for valet when they book a place that shouldn't.\n\nIDK how much more per night you would need to charge to cover valet but prices would go up and tipping means most will pay more even if it doesn't.   \n\nIf those people were willing to pay more for valet and etc why didn't they?   Really think about that.   Don't hunt down customers who wouldn't stay at your place unless where they wanted wasn't available.  And don't price yourself out of customers who would stay if the price was just a bit less.  \n\nYour competition is unlikely to be the 5 star hotel in town.   It is the other 2-3 star(?) places.  Price and location plus basic quality are what you are likely competing on.  Free breakfast might help you win but I doubt valet would.   It just isn't something people in that market are IMO normally looking for.",

Sounds okay until you factor in that I'm working every single day.\n\nThe problem isn't the hours. I knew it would be hard. The problem is the hours keep going up but revenue stays flat.\n\nThree months ago I was working maybe 50 hours a week. Now it's closer to 70. I'm not taking on more clients. I'm just spending more time on things that feel productive but probably aren't.\n\nI'm using all these tools to \"save time.\" Email automation, meal plan templates, Calendly, ChatGPT for writing responses, APOB for videos, probably 10 other things I'm forgetting. Every week I add another tool that's supposed to make things easier.\n\nBut I'm busier than ever. I spend half my day managing the tools. Checking if the automation worked. Fixing things that broke. Tweaking settings. It's like I'm running a tech stack instead of a coaching business.\n\nMy girlfriend asked me last week why I'm always on my laptop. I tried to explain I'm \"building systems\" but she just looked at me and said \"you're always busy but nothing ever changes.\"\n\nShe's right. My client count hasn't moved in two months. I had three people cancel last month. When I asked why, one of them said my messages \"feel like templates\" and she's paying for personal coaching. That one hurt because I've been trying to be more efficient with check-ins so I have time for other stuff.\n\nI think I'm using all these tools to avoid doing the actual hard work. The hard work is reaching out to people. Asking for referrals. Actually talking to potential clients instead of hoping my content brings them in. Sitting down with each client for real conversations instead of sending them a template.\n\nBut that stuff is uncomfortable and slow and I can't measure it. Tools feel like progress. I can see the metrics. I can tell myself I'm being smart and efficient.\n\nMeanwhile I'm working 70 hours a week to make $4500/month and I barely see my girlfriend anymore. Last Sunday she asked if I wanted to go hiking and I said I needed to make videos for the week. I didn't even go outside that day.\n\nI see other coaches who seem to work normal hours and make more than me. I asked one of them how he manages everything and he said \"I just talk to people.\" No automation. No content calendar. He just has conversations and asks for referrals.\n\nI don't know how to stop. Every time I think about turning off one of these systems I panic because what if that was the thing that was actually working?\n\nI'm trapped in this thing where I'm too busy to figure out if I'm doing the right things.\n\nDid I build myself into a corner?",

The tool trap is real and it's insidious because every new tool feels like progress.\n\n\n\nHere's what I think is happening based on what you described: you're using tools to avoid the uncomfortable work. Talking to people, asking for referrals, having real conversations -- that stuff is scary because it involves potential rejection. Setting up an automation sequence feels productive and safe. But safe doesn't grow the business.\n\n\n\nThe guy who just talks to people and makes more than you? He's doing the one thing that actually generates revenue. Everything else is a support function.\n\n\n\nWhat worked for me when I was in this exact trap:\n\n\n\n\\- I did a \"tool audit.\" Listed every tool I pay for and every tool I spend time managing. Then I asked one question for each: \"Did this directly lead to a new client in the last 90 days?\" Most of them didn't. I cancelled about 60% of them.\n\n\n\n\\- I set a rule: no more than 30 minutes per day on \"systems.\" Everything else is client-facing work.\n\n\n\n\\- I went back to basics. Made a list of 10 people I could call that day and asked for referrals or just caught up. Within a week I had 2 new leads from conversations.\n\n\n\nYour girlfriend is right. You're always busy but nothing changes. The discomfort you feel when you think about stopping a system is the same discomfort that's keeping you from doing the work that actually matters. Lean into it.",

You sound buried in fake work. 28 clients at 150 to 200 each is already proof people will pay you. That’s validation. But instead of doubling down on more conversations and referrals, you built a mini tech company around it.\n\nMost small coaching businesses don’t scale with tools. They scale with relationships. And yeah, clients can feel templates instantly. The moment it feels automated, it stops feeling like coaching and starts feeling like an app.\n\nIf it were me, I’d probably cut half the stack and go back to basics for a month. Fewer systems. More calls. More direct convos. More “hey, who else do you know that needs this?” What would break if you turned off 70 percent of the tools for two weeks and just focused on talking to clients and prospects?",

No automation checking, no system tweaking. Just spend that whole day either talking to current clients or reaching out to people who might become clients.

          "body": "As a coaching business I think you are overcomplicating things depending on your goals. Ive been a PT, mixed with some online coaching and now I run a solo clinic. \nThere are different paths you can go for online coaching. One is the higher value one and the other is lower value but more clients.\nIf you go for higher value one you can forget about finished templates, you can have a few that you customize to fit each client but never identical. You need to focus on giving as much value for the client, make it feel as much personal and customized as possible. Good follow ups/sessions, plans, tests, measurable progress. Make your \"product\" as high end as possible. Think if you were to train top athletes, celebrities, people that have enough money to not care how much they spend but they think about what they get. Each client pay enough so you dont need many, the ratio is up to you and your goals but value needs to match the price.\n\nThe other path is to have a system where more clients doesnt mean less time. Meaning if you had 100 clients, you would spend the same amount as 50. But this is not true coaching. This path you have some templates that match the clients goals, needs and wants. There 2 routes you can go here, either subscription based, one time buys. For subscription based you need a platform they like and \"depend\" on for their workout for example a platform with tracking, guides and logs. The one time buys, you have programs lasting 4-6 weeks for example for cutting or bulking. And a way to have them buying new products. So you add a new program for example every month. So if they liked the first one, they might try a new one after they are done. Or you can have different phases of programs like beginner, intermediate and advanced. Its basically up to you to make templates that covers everything you would want.\n\nI think you or the clients see your product as the first, but your trying to build the other types and its mixing which gives wrong signal to you and them. So it really depends on your goal and vision, just make it laser focused and make it clear what your aiming at instead of aiming it everywhere. Because it sounds like your hitting a little bit of everywhere and its barely making a dent",

Map out your entire business model as one big process, then define what success looks like in each domain. Decide on a handful of KPIs that you’ll track closely, these will be your decision making tools. \n\nFrom there, A/B test everything. If you’re using a complicated system for messages, try to design a simpler one. Then do an A/B test and see how much the complex one really adds to your bottom line.

Have coffee with that coach you mentioned. No tools, no automation, just talking to humans about their problems.\n\n5. **Raise your prices or change your model.** If someone canceled because your messages feel like templates, that's actually valuable feedback.

Yes, I could do online or incorporate technology or I could do private lessons in person but I choose the very traditional method of instructing a class. \nIt probably took a little bit more leg work to set up then you setting up your online coaching but like I said I'm old school. It takes very little of my time per week though. \n\nWhen reading you have 28 clients that doesn't sound like a lot but then when I think that this is a physical activity coaching kind of thing, you didn't say how many sessions a week you have with each person??\nI would assume at least one but likely to for many people so your average might be over two.\n\nAll of a sudden this becomes a pretty heavy workload because if you're having almost 60 sessions per month or more then that means you're having two per day and these things are probably at least 30 minutes or an hour. \nYou have to prep and have set up time etc and likely takes some time after you session too.\n\nI know too some people who have full-time jobs and put in at least eight hours a day they don't see this as being a lot but they also don't realize how much idle time occurs at most of those 8 hour per day jobs. \n\nSo I can certainly see this being a little hectic. \n\nScheduling would seem to be the key for this part in trying to get them back to back etc but I guess you're saying that it's not the actual on the clock work thing that's waiting you down but rather all the accessory operations. \n\n\nI agree with what you said about the lady telling you it seemed to automated because that's a big brush off today and even worse with AI coming on stronger. \nI'm all about the personal attention and building relationships.\n\nI think a lot of people in businesses try to do too much or want to do too much so they incorporate these outside things or software etc to help them. \n\nI guess my suggestion would be to sit down and think of an alternate business plan like you were setting this up from the beginning. \nStart making notes and writing everything down and see what the basic minimum things you really need to do are. \nThis should actually be easier now then if you would have done it before you started because now you should know some of the things that are definitely important to focus on and you should be able to take some of the things you're doing now and realize they're not that important nor are they benefiting you much. \n\nSo think about a massively streamlined approach. I would think there has to be several ways you can cut down the time you spend watching everything and tweaking everything which I bet a lot of it is just worrying that things aren't getting messed up. \n\nIt would be nice to feel more confident that you could walk away from everything for 5 or 6 hours and come back and not worry that will be messed up anything it was, it shouldn't be anything that you couldn't fix in 6 minutes. \n\nThe only thing I see that can cause conflict in relationships and also other employment when you have businesses like this is the fact that you're always on call to take phone calls. \n\nI have a fairly strict policy about not conducting business via text messaging and so many people have embraced text messaging completely and that's a real problem. \nThere's no rules or etiquette about text messaging like there haven't been with emails since their inception early on. \nPeople will often not call someone very earlier very late but they'll send a text or an email anytime!\nAnd in the service industry like this if you don't respond to their text in 5 minutes, they feel neglected. \n\nOf course needy clients and high maintenance ones we'll just call you way too frequently or at odd times if they don't have the text option. \n\nThis can be a tough one but most people don't need their hand held quite so much and most can get by with just the hand holding during their actual sessions.\n\nMy biggest concern would be maintaining my number of clients and if I got low putting some extra time into picking up some new ones but other than that I don't see what is so critical to watch all the time or put so much time into ...

          "body": "Because most business advice comes from people who’ve never had to get a stranger to trust them with no brand, no proof, and no referral.\n\nThe corporate playbook assumes you already have traffic, pipeline, brand recognition, and a sales team. Strip all that away and you’re left with the actual hard part — getting someone who has no reason to care about you to believe you can solve their problem.\n\nI’ve spent 15+ years working with small service businesses and I’ll tell you what actually works at that stage because it’s stupidly simple and nobody talks about it.\n\nGo find people who have the problem you solve and tell them what’s wrong. For free. No pitch. No “let me know if you need help.” Just show them something about their own situation that they didn’t see before.\n\nI literally got my first handful of clients by looking at local businesses and pointing out specific things that were costing them money. Not vague “your marketing could be better” stuff. Specific, concrete, “you’re losing customers here and here’s why” stuff. Half of them didn’t hire me. The other half couldn’t hire me fast enough because nobody had ever just told them the truth without trying to sell them something first.\n\nThat’s the part the LinkedIn crowd will never teach you. At the startup and small business level, the sale happens when someone realizes you see their problem more clearly than they do. Not when you pitch them a solution. Not when you close them with some framework. When they feel genuinely understood by someone who clearly knows what they’re looking at.\n\nThe advice isn’t sexy. Go find 10 businesses this week. Look at what they’re doing. Tell them what you see. Don’t ask for anything. Some of them will ask you what it would cost to fix it. That’s your first clients.\n\nEverything else — the funnels, the content strategy, the sales process — that’s all stuff you build after you’ve proven you can actually help someone. Not before.",

Because most of the people giving advice skipped the part you are in.\n\nThey are talking about optimizing pipelines and tightening close rates.\n\nYou are just trying to get someone to say yes.\n\nEarly stage problems are not “How do I increase conversion by 2 percent?”\n\nThey are:\n\nHow do I get my first 5 customers?\n\nHow do I talk to businesses when nobody knows who we are?\n\nHow do I not feel like I am faking it every time I pitch?\n\nThe reason it all sounds corporate is because it is optimization advice, not survival advice.\n\nHere is the simple version nobody says clearly.\n\nSales only happen in 4 ways:\n\nKnown. People who already know you.\n\nUnknown. Strangers you reach out to directly.\n\nOrganic. Content people find over time.\n\nPaid. Ads, affiliates, sponsorships.\n\nThat's it. All current, past and future conversations will fall into one of those buckets.\n\nMost startups try to jump straight to organic or paid because it feels scalable and legit. It's a tremendous waste of capital and time to try and validate your stuff by paying to show it to others.\n\nBut if you cannot sell one on one to:\n\nSomeone who already knows you\n\nOr a complete stranger\n\nThen ads will just amplify the fact that the offer or messaging is not dialed in yet.\n\nThe unsexy path actually works:\n\nFirst, go to your “known” network. Make a list of 20 people. Start conversations. Not hard pitches. Just real conversations. There should be somebody who's you either know or somebody who knows somebody else in your network who could utilize your solution typically.\n\nThen move to “unknown.” Pick one channel. Cold email, cold call, DMs, whatever. Talk to 5 strangers a day. You will suck at first. That is the point. Just execute, everybody wants some sort of magic bullet. They're looking for a Xanax pill that's going to just blow them up overnight when really what they need is physical therapy. You have to get really good at selling this thing. Two strangers before you can graduate to the next steps.\n\nOnce you can consistently sell one on one, then start making content based on the exact questions people keep asking you.\n\nThen, and only then, scale it with paid.\n\nYour friend is partially right about sales, it's the lifeblood of any business and the reality is that most businesses are shockingly bad at it.\n\nIt is because you are guessing which of the four lanes you are actually in.\n\nFor now you just need to stick with one thing and get really good at that channel.\n\n[I explain the whole breakdown here if you want it laid out clearly.](https://youtu.be/5EjzIA-Zyd8?si=zuPJs2PCpaC2-Exn)\n\nIt will probably save you a lot of wasted time and money",

He was running a pressure vessels fabrication business with a turnover of around 7 crore annually.\n\nAfter his passing, my cousin (who is a CA and not from the fabrication field) took over as caretaker. In one year, turnover has fallen from 7 crore to 2 crore.We are getting complaints about the pressure vessels we manufacture. Workers seem lazy, and quality has dropped.\n\nI’m currently studying BSc Data Science, which has nothing to do with fabrication. I don’t know anything about pressure vessels, welding, AutoCAD, production planning, client handling, inspections, or site work.\n\nTo make it more complicated:\n\nSome workers are relatives.\n\nI suspect mismanagement.\n\nI don’t fully trust my cousin.\n\nI don’t know how to talk confidently with workers or clients.\n\nI don’t want to sound rude, but I also don’t want to look weak.\n\nI feel completely unprepared.\n\nIf I want to take control:\n\nWhere do I start learning this industry from scratch? (AutoCAD, fabrication drawings, welding standards, pressure vessel codes, etc.)\n\nHow do I audit whether the business is being mismanaged?\n\nHow do I deal with workers who are older than me and don’t take me seriously?\n\nHow do I communicate firmly without creating family drama?\n\nWhat should my first 3–6 months plan look like?\n\nI’m not looking for motivation. I need practical steps.\n\nIf anyone here runs a fabrication/engineering/manufacturing business or has taken over a family business young, please guide me.\n\nThanks.",

No one but you should have the ability to release payments. \n- Post a job and hire a senior technical person who has been in the pressure vessel industry for good 15-20 years.\n- If unable to hire this experienced person full time, bring him on a retainer and learn the trade from him. He could be a consultant and he should be your guy! \n- Get your hands dirty. Learn the trade on the ground. For example, if you get a new order, tell the current team that you will work with them and finish the entire order with you on the line.  Even if it means working alongside the labor because unless you know the product/process inside out, they will/may keep fooling you. \n- Contact the customer that complained about the product. Check with your consultant that you will bring on board on what went sideways and consult your internal technical team as well. It could just be a case of order getting completed but the revenue may be pocketed by someone internally. \n- Investigate the dropped revenue and check with those clients who no longer deal with your company on what went wrong? \n\nTake immediate control before your family/employees eat the company out from the inside. Good luck! ",

          "body": "Hello! What made me stop and read this fully is your age. 21. Most people would just walk away in your situation but you are asking how to take responsibility and that is serious intent which matters.\n\nA quick context for you so you know where I am coming from:  I have worked with multiple agencies and founder-led businesses over the last 15 years. I have seen revenue collapse, family politics, silent mismanagement, and operational chaos up close. I don’t run a fabrication business, but I understand business structure, leadership drift, and how systems break. \n\nI would address your post as follows: \n\nFirstly, separate emotions from structure. Right now you have 4 parallel problems (as per your post):\n\n1. Technical knowledge gap\n\n2. Operational breakdown\n\n3. Financial opacity\n\n4. Family power dynamics\n\nIf you try to solve it all at once, you will end up drowning. \n\nHere is what your first 90 days should look like:\n\nMonth 1: Observe, don’t react: Sit inside operations daily. Shop floor. Client calls. Vendor calls.\n\nAsk dumb questions. Take notes.\n\nGet access to full financials; last 24 months. Cash flow, receivables, payables. Everything related to money coming in and going out. \n\nList all active orders and their status. Do not assume anything. Note it only if it exists on paper. \n\nYour only focus in Month 1: understand the business reality.\n\nMonth 2: Audit quietly\n\nCheck: Why did revenue fall from 7 to 2? Lost clients? Pricing? Delays? Quality issues?\n\nSpeak to 3–5 old clients directly. Ask what changed.\n\nCheck production rejection rate and complaint logs.\n\nMap who actually makes decisions today. On paper and in reality.\n\n\nIf you suspect mismanagement, you need data to validate it and not confrontation.\n\nMonth 3: Take controlled authority\n\nDefine weekly production targets.\n\nImplement a simple reporting rhythm (daily output, order status, cash position).\n\nSeparate relatives from roles. No one is “family” in a production meeting. Only role and output matter.\n\n\nNow about workers older than you: you do not earn authority through volume. You earn it through clarity.\n\nDon’t say “I think.”\nSay: “This is the plan for this week. Here’s what we are tracking.” Calm. Measured. Structured. Consistent.\n\nOn technical learning: You do not need to become the best welder. You need enough knowledge to not be fooled.\n\nStart with: Basic pressure vessel fundamentals\n\n1. ASME codes overview\n\n2. Welding process basics\n\n3. Quality inspection checklist\n\n4. Visit competitors quietly if possible\n\nSpend 60–90 mins daily learning for 6 months. This compounding matters. Most importantly, control cash first. Every rupee. A traditional business dies from cash suffocation before ego issues.\n\nAnd one hard truth: If your cousin is mismanaging, this will become political. So build numbers as proof before you build arguments.\n\nI don't think you are unprepared, you are just early to the game. If you want, you can reach out directly. I am not an industry expert in fabrication, but I can help you think through structure, authority, and 90-day execution without emotion. All the best!",

Don't worry too much about your negatives - you need to what you need to inspite of them. Slowly with time, you'll find your footing if you are grounded, accountable and motivated with the right attitude. Don't press the panic button too early. Control the controllables and people's opinions are not in your control. Focus on your work ethic, and your decision making, and management. Be okay with making the wrong calls. Learn and do better.

In order for her to legally operate, the space needs renovations to meet Minnesota code (ventilation, plumbing for a pedicure chair, restoring washer/dryer hookups that a previous tenant had).\n\nWe got a contractor estimate of $7,400 total for:\n\n\t•\tVentilation/exhaust\n\n\t•\tPlumbing for pedicure chair\n\n\t•\tWasher/dryer hookups\n\n\t•\tSheetrock and painting\n\nThe landlord says he’s willing to “help pay half”, but his half would be amortized and added into our rent over the term of the new lease.\n\nThis raises a few concerns for me:\n\n\t•\tIt feels like we’re still effectively paying 100% of the renovation, just spread out over time\n\n\t•\tIf rent increases annually (e.g., 2%), the increase would apply to the higher rent that includes the renovation amount\n\n\t•\tThese renovations are permanent improvements that add value to the building and benefit the landlord long-term\n\n\t•\tIf we ever leave early, it’s unclear whether we’d still be paying for improvements we no longer benefit from\n\nOn the other hand:\n\n\t•\tSharing the space would still lower my out-of-pocket rent compared to renting alone\n\n\t•\tThe landlord is at least open to contributing, just not upfront\n\nSo I’m trying to figure out:\n\n\t•\tIs this structure common or reasonable in commercial leases?\n\n\t•\tIs there a better way to negotiate this (e.g., separate line item, cost cap, forgiveness if lease ends early)?\n\n\t•\tShould landlord-paid improvements ever be rolled into base rent?\n\n\t•\tWhat protections should we ask for if this is done through rent?\n\nWe haven’t agreed to lease length yet (3 vs 5 years is still open), and nothing has been signed.\n\nI’d really appreciate hearing from anyone with experience on whether this makes sense or how you’d handle it differently.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nLocation: Coon Rapid, Minnesota ",

Landlords will sometimes pay for tenant improvements to attract better tenants: more financially stable ones, or longer leases, or whatever.

Then it doesn't increase with your step-up, and you can handle paying it off separately from whatever other lease obligations you have.\n\nLast point: you sound like you have one foot out the door.

The other way to do it is have a certain construction budget built into the asking price and then negotiating how much to give based on desirability or credit worthiness of the tenant. Or refusing to do any TI at all.\n\nIt's a pretty common structure. It's what I use.  I include an interest rate as well and encourage my tenants to use cash or and sba loan if they don't like it.\n\nEvery expense the landlord has is rolled into rent. So is profit margin.  You as the tenants would be paying 100% of the cost no matter what.\n\nIf you leave early the landlord will want and have a legal claim for the unamortized cost of the improvements.\n\nIt's a stretch to assume these specific improvements increase the long term value of the space.  In ground grease traps and built kitchens tend to do that; not much else does.  \n\nYes the landlord gets cpi or rent increase percentage on the difference. He'd get this having higher base rent.\n\nYou could try and negotiate that the rent increase ends at the end of the amortized period or make a mental note to bring it up and ask for new stuff.\n\nWhen we do this sort of thing we have a hard bid from the contractor and any change order by the tenant they pay cash for.  In other words it's set scope, signed contract, fixed rent and fixed landlord contribution.\n\nPersonally I think the issue you have is why you would assume liability for the loan to build the improvements your cotenant needs for their business but you don't need for yours.  At the very least that should play into your discussions with her about what she pays vs. you.  You should be mindful that if she bails you still owe the rent and improvements payment.
