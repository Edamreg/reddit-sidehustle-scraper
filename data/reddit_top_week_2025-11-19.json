Websites/online businesses. \n2. follow the “5-1” concept. \n\nWhy Websites? \nThey work for you 365 days a year and allow access to people around the world. They’re the best employee’s ever and Theyre cheap!  \n\nthey never sleep, they don’t take days off, and never call in sick. With websites, 1-person corporations are possible and Making money while you sleep will never, ever, ever get old. \n\nWhat’s The 5-1 concept: \n- 1 specific target market. \n- solve 1 of the problems they have.\n- offer 1 quality product/service.\n- post/focus on 1 social platform only.\n- do the above for 1 year \n\nWhy this works so well:\nEntrepreneurs fail because there’s too many ways, to do too many things, with too many options, too many distractions, and way too many hats to wear as the owner, which = too much stress because constant states of confusion is never productive and if your not productive, no money.\n\nThe solution to the above is just Deliberate focus on the 5-1 concept.\n\nYOU BECOME AN EXPERT AT THE “1’s” you choose because it’s the same obstacle everyday, NOT a different obstacle.  \n\nyou literally get better at the 1 things you choose on a daily basis:\n\n- better at understanding the target markets pain points\n- overall better pitch because you know all the rebuttals and excuses why the customer won’t buy, so you’re prepared for everything a customer might say\n- better social engagement because 1 platform gets all your attention—youre posts will get better every week\n\nThe 5-1 literally BREEDS compound interest and \nCompound interest is the land where millionaires are bred.\n\nTou got this, just focus and don’t get distracted.  Get better everyday at your 5 and success will find you.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been trying to make money online for a while now, and honestly I’ve tested like 10 different things. Most of them either paid basically nothing or took forever to see any results. I kept jumping from idea to idea because everyone online makes it look so easy, but when you actually try it, it’s a whole different story. Being a student doesn’t help either, I barely have time and I’m always broke, so I needed something that actually works without a bunch of start-up costs.\nAfter trying all that stuff, only a few things ended up giving me real payouts. Making short little brand videos on Methods app has been surprisingly decent, I’m not some influencer or anything, but the beginner tasks still pay something. I also started putting simple digital templates on Etsy, and I sell small guides and checklists on Gumroad whenever I have time to make new ones. And when I need quick tiny cash, KashKick fills in the gaps, even if it’s not a lot. These aren’t huge money makers, but when you stack them together, it’s actually helped me get through the last couple months.\nI’m still learning and trying things though, because I kinda need every extra dollar I can get right now. If anyone else is also doing low-effort or beginner-friendly online stuff that pays even a little, I’d love to hear what’s been working for you. I’m really just trying to survive school without going completely broke lol.",

          "body": "I’ve found that profitable side hustles never come by googling the subject.  They come by shifting your perspective slightly.  Any time you see anyone advertising or doing anything.  Ask yourself, why are they doing that, how does that work, how hard is it to do that exact thing?  Talk to real people you know.  Chances are they like you and will tell you what they’re up to.  All those people living around you in a big city…they’re all making money…and it’s not just a full-time job.  Be observant.  And once people find a profitable side hustle, the last thing they want are copycats so they do not post it online.  But it does take imagination, brainpower and often learning new skills.  Just don’t let your brain hold you back.  Never let your brain tell you that you could never do that for whatever reason.  With all the free learning tools out there these days there’s literally nothing that you can’t figure out.  If you see an AD online that says ‘Make Money Easy Online’.  Don’t fall for it.  The person posting that AD is the only one making money.  You can try copying what they’re doing if you want.  But don’t buy what they’re trying to sell.",

Did that for 5 years. YouTube ad revenue sharing I got about $100 a month. If lucky maybe around $200. Some affiliate sales but that was really hard to get people to click on the link. YouTube videos every week or several a week is hard to maintain. Burnt out with it. In the end I just felt defeated. Not saying to give up or not try. If you want to go for it.

      "selftext": "I stumbled into this completely by accident and now I'm kicking myself for not starting sooner. I was scrolling through Instagram and saw some lifestyle bloggers with decent followings but their websites were... rough. Slow loading times, no internal linking, missing alt tags - basic stuff that kills their Google rankings. So I sent a few DMs. Something like: *\"Hey, love your content! Just checked your site and noticed a few quick fixes that could boost your traffic. Would you be interested in a site optimization? I can have it done this week.\"*\n\nThe response rate shocked me. Out of 10 messages, 2-3 people responded interested. They were RELIEVED someone reached out. Most of them know their site has issues but have no idea how to fix it or think it'll cost thousands.\n\nWhat I actually do:\n\n* Run their site through free tools (PageSpeed Insights, Screaming Frog)\n* Fix image compression and lazy loading\n* Add internal links between their posts (I use help of AI for this - automates the whole thing in like 5 mins)\n* Update meta descriptions and titles\n* Fix broken links\n* Find ideas for content (thanks to competitors analysis which is also performed by this tool)\n\nTotal time: 20-30 minutes per site. Charge: $100. The best part?\n\nThese bloggers are genuinely happy. Their sites load faster, they start seeing better rankings, and they think I'm some kind of wizard. Meanwhile I'm literally just following a checklist I learned from YouTube.\n\nI'm doing 4-5 of these per week now. That's an extra $400-500 for maybe 3 hours of actual work (not counting the hours spent looking for such guys)\n\nI can't tell you where and how exactly I find these people because honestly, I don't need more competition in my niche 😂 But let's just say there are platforms where content creators hang out and complain about their website problems...\n\nMy advice if you want to try this:\n\n1. Learn basic SEO fixes (literally just watch a few YouTube videos)\n2. Find people with content but bad websites\n3. Reach out professionally, don't be spammy\n4. Deliver quick results\n5. Ask for testimonials to build credibility\n\nThe barrier to entry is incredibly low. You don't need to be an expert - you just need to know slightly more than the person you're helping.\n\nAnyone else doing something similar? Or am I the only opportunist here taking advantage of people's laziness to Google things? 😅",

But service businesses are different because you're not tied to expensive real estate. One thing I'd suggest is looking at businesses where you can test the concept first before going all in. Like if you're thinking about a cleaning franchise, maybe try running a small independent version for a few months to see if you even like managing crews and dealing with customers.

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I posted this in another subreddit and I got some heartwarming messages that it inspired them, so I'm going to share this with you, hopefully it can inspire some of you as well. (I don't have anything to sell, don't worry.)\n\nI’ve been doing Amazon KDP (Amazon's self publishing platform) since August of 2024, a little over a year now. It is possible to do it on the side, I didn't because I started with nothing. Literally. No money, living out of my car, and I needed to do something about my situation. I want to share my full experience scaling this from $0 to $150K revenue. The lessons I learned, and why I think KDP is nowhere near saturated as many claim.\n\nMy hope is that this post will give you value, motivation, and perspective, especially if you’re just starting out or feel stuck.\n\n# A Little Background\n\nI’ve always been into business, ever since i was a kid flipping Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh cards and other collectibles, plus video game currencies, items, accounts. Over the years I’ve tried everything: forex, stock trading, affiliate marketing, SEO blogs, dropshipping, customer acquisition/lead generation agency, CPA marketing, SMMA, POD, and of course KDP.\n\nJust to keep in mind, this is not my first time doing KDP. My first attempt was in 2019, but my account got banned in early 2020 for a few (frustrating) reasons:\n\n* I used a term, that a few months later got filled for trademark and Amazon flagged me, even tho the trademark was just pending and was rejected later.\n* Got hit with a “similar cover” strike ( I should have fought it, probably would have won. Not sure why I didn’t.)\n* Published a book called “Snarky Nurse Coloring Book” with the idea that the book was snarky (snarky quotes), not the nurse. Tt got reported by a brand called Snarky Nurse or something similar.\n\nAfter the third strike, Amazon didn’t let me appeal or explain myself, they kept sending the same generic response that the decision is final and nothing could be done.\n\nAfter all this I didn’t do anything, I got comfortable, had plenty in savings, some other life events happened during covid that I lost any motivation to do anything, until life forced me to start again.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nI’m not smart or special. Many people make much more with KDP than I do. But I’ve failed a lot, learned from my mistakes, and treated this like a real business. What I’ll share is what worked for me. Hopefully you’ll learn something useful from it and get some clarity on how you should approach this business if you decide to give it a shot.\n\n# Quick Stats:\n\n* Started: August 2024.\n* Books Published 148. (1 book every 3 days or so)\n* Total Revenue: \\~$150,000\n* Ad Spend: \\~$16,000\n* Employee Costs: \\~$24,000\n* Tools &amp; Subscriptions: \\~$2,500\n* TikTok Marketing Videos: \\~2,000\n* Profit (before tax): \\~100,000\n\nLast month, I made \\~$32,000 revenue, with \\~$10,000 in expenses.\n\n# Lessons, Tests &amp; Observations:\n\n1. **Quality vs. Quantity.** I’ve seen many YouTubers talk about focusing only on quality and to be honest I don’t fully agree. I started with quantity, not because I believed in mass publishing, but because I wanted data. I uploaded many somewhat decent quality books at first (most didn’t even hit 10 sales) and they helped me to identify which niches and formats had potential. Then I moved to more medium quality books, they took me 2-5 days each, in niches that showed potential and these confirmed the winners. I then outsourced even better versions and that’s where most of my revenue came from (excluding the unicorn). So it’s not quality or quantity, you need both to optimize your business.\n2. **Amazon ads.** I’m a numbers guy, I love data, tracking, testing everything. With amazon ads you obviously get more sales, but you also get an 20-30% bump in the organic sales. Sales boost your BSR, help you rank higher, which gets you more sales, more reviews, and all of this combined, a stronger foundation in the algorithm, making it more difficult for competitors to outrank you. So yes, ads are worth it, even beyond direct ROI. There’s another reason why I find ads even more important than getting sales. To be honest I didn’t even start them with the idea to make money from them directly. As I said, I love data, and amazon unfortunately shows you almost no valuable data at all. Running ads helps you a little bit as you can see the impressions you get, how many clicks you get and how many conversions, enough signal to see what’s working and what isn’t. It’s not ideal, but this is what we have to deal with when it comes to amazon.\n3. **Keywords.** Always use relevant keywords, leave fields if you don’t have anything relevant to add. I tested adding trending but not relevant keywords on a couple of books that had \\~20 sales a month each. Sales dropped to 4 and 6 the first month and 1 and 0 on the second month. Removing those irrelevant keywords didn’t restore the sales. Only running ads brought them back. Unrelated words hurt your relevance score, which can tank your book entirely\n4. **External ads.** I had some experimentation with meta ads, spend $600 and made \\~$450 above baseline over the next few months (sales doubled the month with the ads being run and slowly fell back to baseline). Still not enough data to fully judge, I’ll test this more, I need to spend at least $10,000 to have at least some opinion about this, and that’s what I’m going to do in the upcoming months.\n5. **A+ Content.** Almost always helps unless it’s really, really bad. I’ve tested many different layouts, worst ones had \\~10% increase in CVR, the best ones increased 80-150%, depending on the niche and design. Either way, it helps.\n6. **Cover Design (not just artsy, its psychology).** After niche selection, cover is the most important factor. People do judge a book by it’s cover If your design isn’t at least as good as top competitors in that niche, your book is gonna sink in the vast ocean that is Amazon. If you can afford it and your design skills aren’t great, I would suggest outsourcing covers to skilled designers. Still, do some of them yourself, to have a better understanding as not all of it is art, it’s more about the psychology of the customer, it is the pitch for your product. (Also the content of the book has to be good enough as well, because negative reviews can kill your book just as easily as bad cover, just a little slower).\n7. **Descriptions.** I’m not sure if I am just bad at writing them, but I never seen a big difference in CVR from it. The only thing that seems to matter in my experience is the formatting. The description still has to be informative and relevant to the book itself, but if it’s done in a big block of text it’s not gonna help. If it is formatted nicely, then I’ve seen 10-30% CVR improvements. The other thing that I’ve noticed is that having a relevant and informative description helps the book rank higher. It happened consistently enough to make me almost sure that Amazon’s algorithm rewards it.\n8. **Low Search Volume Niches (Small Margins Scale Big).** Pretty much every YouTube video I watched about KDP said to target niches that have high search volume of 1000+ at the minimum and ignore every one of them that get less. I often target niches other skip, even less than 500 searches per month. I care more about competitor strength and actual sales. If I feel I have a fighting chance against the competitor in that kind of niche, that has 100-200k BSR, then I’ll attack it. I get it, making books that are going to get 100-200 sales a month isn’t sexy, but over the year they make $1,200-$2,400, and ten, twenty, thirty, one hundred of these adds up to real income.\n9. **E-mail Lists.** These are great but I’ve only managed to make them work in two situations. In my unicorn niche, I built a list of 1,000+ via a variety of freebies. When I launched a supporting book with a release day discount, I emailed the list and got 200+ day one sales. I’m not saying that 20% of the email list converted, but even if 3-4% can create enough sales velocity to push the book up the rankings making it get even more sales and climb even higher up. Second, with my “client” brand (consumable books). We built the list by running promotional ads and in book freebies. After every weekly release, the email goes out and almost consistently gets 100 day one sales, some releases even get 200-300.\n10. **Short-Form Video Marketing.** One day I got bored and thought about trying out something new, I released a book in a very competitive niche(which means lot’s of interested people) and created a TikTok account to make videos for that book. After printing the book and recording a few videos, repurposing them, following trends, changing the hooks , etc., one video hit nearly 1m views. This led to over 2,000 sales in the first week after upload. Since then I’ve uploaded 250+ videos, hired other people to make videos for me and I’ve had a few other viral videos (not as bit as the original one tho).\n11. **Pricing.** Compete on the quality of your book rather than price, if your book is better than competitor’s, price it higher and position it as premium. Low price makes you look cheap, not “affordable”. The pricing is different depending on the niche and type of the book itself, so what I would recommend is to launch around the average competitor price, could be a little higher if you are confident in your book (that’s what I do), or price it just a little below the average. Monitor CVR, if it is solid, then increase the price by $1 and observe, if it gets too big of a hit, reverse the change if it doesn’t keep increasing the price. If the book ranks high, gets steady organic sales and reviews, push premium pricing.\n12. **99% of Gamblers Give Up Before They Hit it Big.** Okay, maybe not in gambling (please don’t). But in business? Mostly true. Most people give up right before they’ve learned enough both from theirs, and other people’s failures to make their business work. There’s plenty of money in almost every business. Imagine a gambler spinning the slots, after 30 failed spins, he hits jackpot. Business it’s similar, keep testing, keep learning, fail, tweak it, try again. Do that 30 times and on attempt 31 it suddenly looks like you “got lucky”(You didn’t. You just didn’t quit.) If you knew that you were 30 failures away from your dream, would you keep going?\n13. AI Tools as Assistants, Not Crutches Do not let AI do all the work for you. You won’t really learn what’s working and the quality will be subpar. People notice that the book was written by AI and leave negative reviews. Use it to brainstorm ideas, rough outlines, keyword ideas that you’re gonna validate, even sketch A+ layouts. Always double check the accuracy (AI likes to hallucinate) and IP. AI speeds you up, significantly, but it doesn’t do the job for you.\n14. **KDP plateau.** Plateaus do happen at every stage. I sat at a bit over $6,000 per month for a while, luckily for me it was a decent enough revenue to stay motivated. Some people, especially beginners, plateau at $0 per month, or they reach $500 in the first months, stall for a few months, assume “KDP is dead” and quit. It’s not. It’s just lag and learning. The move isn’t to quit, it’s to keep publishing and keep making small improvements. Eventually you’ll break out. Keep going, keep measuring, keep improving and then the compounding finally shows up.\n15. **Outsourcing and delegating.** All of this is going to depend on your budget and skill level. I hire people to go faster, not to disappear. I keep strategy, ads, research, final approval and hand off stuff like covers, interiors, basic edits, videos. I also do some books fully myself to keep improving and learning. At first you should do everything yourself, to learn as much as possible, to even know what to ask your employees to do, to be able to make SOPs for them. Eventually when you can no longer keep up with the amount of books you want to make, you start hiring. Track cost per title, have an idea on how fast the contractors work, how long it is going to take to make a book. Keep light P M Cadence, do weekly check-ins, have a QC checklist before anything goes live. Plan so that one person’s vacation doesn’t stall launches. Pay on time, give bonuses when earned, give specific feedback, promote your A-players.\n16. **Treat it like a real business and I mean REAL business.** KDP isn’t a lottery ticket, it’s a real publishing business. I budget, track unit economics and make decisions off numbers, not vibes. That means knowing your CTR/CVR, ACOS/TACOS, margin, payback time (how long till the book repays it’s investment), opportunity cost, LTV per title and more. Keep a simple P&amp;L, reinvest into ads, books, testing, learning. Write SOPs for contractors, kill or fix anything that doesn’t earn its shelf space. Manage your cashflow, plan for seasonality, keep runway for tests, don’t starve the winners. Be boringly safe on ToS/IP and make sure to set aside money for taxes. Real business = clear goals, clean and tight processes, consistent iteration.\n17. **You need action much more than you need information.** Most people don’t have a knowledge problem, they have a doing problem. You can binge every KDP video, read every post in KDP forums and still have $0 in royalties because you never uploaded anything. On top of that you’re gonna forget most of the stuff you watched either way if you do not try to implement it almost immediately. When and if you’ll start taking action, you’ll go back and start rewatching those videos again with context. Learn just enough to take action. By taking action you’ll learn the most. Half baked action beats perfect research because market teaches faster than any tutorial. Most importantly be consistent with your action, and consistently improve with it.\n\n# Key Takeaways\n\nKDP is not oversaturated. People said that it was already “too late” back in 2019 when I first started, and they’ll say the same in 2030. The real difference is how you treat KDP. Treat it like a real business. Track data. Build Systems. Reinvest Profits. TEST RELENTLESSLY. Be consistent and improve every week. Stagnation is death, and even to maintain your level, you have to keep evolving because the competition is evolving. Plan your week. Every Sunday, I write down my tasks and deadlines. And I need to do them. No excuses. That habit alone kept me on track for 60-70 hours a week for over a year.\n\n# My Goals for the Future\n\nThis December my plan is to get to $100,000 - the coveted six figure month. I know it’s possible, because December sales can triple or quadruple.  \nBut my goals don’t stop here.\n\n**My next milestone for 2026:**  \n$1,000,000 in total revenue  \n$253k+ in December 2026 alone.  \nThe reason for that specific figure is that back in 2020 I spoke with someone who made $252K in December 2019 with a team consisting of her and her husband. I’m going to have a bigger team than that to try to hit this number, but let’s ignore that fact.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis year has been life-changing. I went from being broke and sleeping in my car to running a six figure publishing business. I don’t think that this was luck. It was consistency, constant improvement, and treating KDP like the serious business it is. If you’re reading this and were thinking about quitting. DON’T. Keep going, test things, learn from your data, stay disciplined. Do not think “What if it’s not going work out? What if I fail?”. Think “What if everything does work out?”.",

With one Reddit post, in under 2 weeks, I’ve had 6 customers for a total of 13 hours. People have been extremely generous paying anywhere from $25 to $40 an hour so far! \n\nNot a lot of hours yet, but very helpful when in need and I only needed a rake, bicycle, and cellphone to do it. \n\nDepending where you live, every season has work people will often pay well for. Here in Canada snow shovelling is a big one after the leaf raking is over. Anyone else try similar ideas?\n\nGood luck! 💵💰",

      "selftext": "If you’re looking for a high-leverage side hustle in 2025, I genuinely think building a micro SaaS is the move. You don’t need VC money, a team, or years of coding experience anymore.\n\nHere’s the formula:\n\nFind a problem you’ve personally experienced, something annoying that costs you time or energy, and build a solution around that inside of Lovable. It’ll handle all the SaaS boilerplate for you, so you can focus on the actual product. Use Supabase for your backend and Stripe for payments. That’s your foundation sorted.\n\nNow when it comes to marketing, this is where most people go wrong. The first 30 days should be 100% organic. That looks like:\n\n1. Reddit posts that don’t feel like plugs. Ask questions or share your story in communities related to your niche. Don’t sell, just spark discussion.\n\n2. Reddit replies under competitor mentions. Add real value to existing threads; people will click through naturally.\n\n3. YouTube comment placements. Leave thoughtful comments under videos where your target users hang out.\n\n4. Short-form videos. Post simple slideshows or product demos daily on TikTok, Reels, and Shorts, like “top 5 controversial things I learnt about XYZ” \n\n5. AI UGC videos. Use an avatar or voiceover to share your product demo with a catchy hook like “Can’t believe this tool does X.”\n\n6. Green screen memes. “POV: you realised [pain your product solves]” it’s quick, relatable, viral.\n\n7. Standing avatar + wall of text. Static background, emotional or relatable text overlay; crazy watch time, easy to make.\n\nThese plays can bring your first 100 users without spending a cent on ads. Stack them daily, and you’ll start building real momentum fast.\n\nBtw you can run these marketing strategies inside something like Canva or Aftermark AI ",

They handle global taxes, invoicing, and compliance automatically so beginners don’t get stuck on the accounting part.\n\nBut overall, your marketing breakdown is on point,  most people underestimate how far consistent organic content can take them.",

I'd love to share them with people, but I'm not sure 1,000 rows of unstructured notes would do anyone much good. \n\nSo I'm curious: if you could subscribe to a newsletter/podcast that shares new ideas in a short-form, easy-to-follow format, what would you like to see included?

          "body": "In today’s world, financial pressure on young adults is undeniable. The rising cost of education, housing, and general living expenses, combined with the desire for financial independence, has made a single source of income feel insufficient. Fortunately, the modern economy, powered by technology and connectivity, has opened up countless opportunities to earn extra money. For young adults, this \"side hustle\" culture isn't just a trend; it's a practical way to build savings, pay down debt, or simply afford a better quality of life. The methods available are vast, ranging from flexible app-based gigs to monetizing unique personal skills online.\nThe most accessible entry point for many is the gig economy. This term refers to the ecosystem of apps and platforms that connect workers directly with customers for short-term, on-demand jobs. Think of services like Uber and Lyft for ridesharing, or DoorDash, Instacart, and Uber Eats for food and grocery delivery. These jobs are popular for a reason: the barrier to entry is low, and the scheduling is incredibly flexible, allowing you to work around classes or another job. Beyond delivery, platforms like Rover and Wag connect animal lovers with pet-sitting and dog-walking gigs, while TaskRabbit allows you to get paid for helping people with moving, furniture assembly, or yard work. While this work provides immediate income, it can be inconsistent and is often tied to your location and the time you're willing to put in.\nFor those with specific digital skills, the world of online freelancing offers a path to higher-paying and more career-focused work. Young adults, often \"digital natives,\" are uniquely positioned to excel here. Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr have created global marketplaces where you can sell your talents. If you are a strong writer, you can get paid for writing blog posts, website copy, or social media updates. If you have an eye for design, you can create logos, social media graphics, or presentations for businesses. Other in-demand skills include video editing, programming, and even administrative tasks as a \"virtual assistant,\" helping busy professionals manage their email and schedules from afar. This route not only provides income but also builds a professional portfolio, which can be invaluable for your future career.\nIf you have a more entrepreneurial or creative spirit, you might explore the creator and e-commerce economy. This involves building a brand or business online. One popular path is e-commerce, which can be as simple as \"thrifting\" or finding unique clothing and reselling it on platforms like Depop, Poshmark, or eBay. If you are crafty, you can open an Etsy shop to sell handmade goods, art, or even digital products like resume templates, photo-editing presets, or planners. On the creator side, platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch allow you to build an audience around a passion, whether it's gaming, cooking, or education. While it is a slow process, a dedicated following can be monetized through ad revenue, brand sponsorships, and selling merchandise. This path requires patience and consistency, as you are building an asset, not just trading time for money.\nFinally, it’s important not to overlook the power of traditional, local services. Not every side hustle has to be high-tech. There is always a reliable demand for in-person skills. If you excel in a particular subject, academic or music tutoring is a classic and well-paying option. Babysitting and nannying remain in high demand, offering steady, reliable income. Other valuable local services include house cleaning, landscaping, car washing, or offering tech support to less tech-savvy neighbors, like helping seniors set up their smartphones or computers. These jobs often pay in cash and help you build a strong reputation within your community, leading to consistent work through word-of-mouth referrals.\nUltimately, the best method for earning extra money depends entirely on your personal skills, available time, and financial goals. The gig economy offers speed and flexibility, while freelancing builds a valuable portfolio. E-commerce and content creation provide a path to building your own brand, and local services offer reliable, community-based income. The key is to recognize that your time and skills have value. By exploring these options, you can move beyond relying on a single paycheck and take active control of your financial future.",

      "selftext": "My name is Tim. I’m from Hoofddorp, a small town next to Amsterdam. I work full-time as a teacher and I teach history at a primary school. Alongside my full-time job, I have always traded in domain names. I have successfully sold many domains, such as hond.nl, fietsenwinkel.nl and many more. For over twenty years, I’ve earned an extra monthly income this way. Sometimes I made €3,000, but usually between €1,000 and €1,500 per month by buying and selling domain names.\n\nHowever, the past year has been very disappointing because there are very few good names left with extensions like .com, .eu and .nl. I was actually thinking about quitting… until I had a conversation with a colleague who emigrated to Dubai. He told me that the .ae extension is becoming increasingly popular among locals and  many international companies due to tourism growth.\n\nEspecially in the real estate sector, .ae domains are used more and more to build trust when selling expensive villas. You can easily buy .com or .nl domains anywhere, which has led to a lot of scammers. A .ae domain, on the other hand, is harder to obtain and requires passport verification before the government approves the registration (you don´t need to have a pasport-ID from the emirates, you just need to have an ID and that´s it.. I live in the Netherlands and that´s also fine.\n\nSo I decided to give it a try. In the first weeks I invested €360, because through hosts like OnlyDomains you pay around €36 per year for a .ae domain. I immediately bought the domains palmjumeirahvillas.ae and palmjumeirahhotels.ae. Within a week I sold them simply by emailing real estate companies with an offer.\n\nIn the first month I earned €9,800, and the month after that €15,600. It continued like that for a while. Recently, I’ve noticed that competition is increasing and profits are slightly lower, so I started flipping: I bought domains I had previously owned again and resold them within a week with a 60% margin. In the end, I’ve now made €100,000 and I’m enjoying my time alongside my job even more.\n\nI hope young, driven entrepreneurs read this and find some motivation. There are so many opportunities as long as you think of a good idea and apply it to a niche that is rapidly growing. Follow the market! We can clearly see that the housing market in Dubai is extremely popular, so we respond to that.\n\nI wish you all a wonderful evening and lots of success.",

Almost every business today needs video content for marketing, whether it is Instagram reels, TikTok shorts, YouTube videos, or website promos. The demand is huge and growing.\n\nYou don’t need to be a filmmaker. You can learn basic editing in a week. The only part most beginners struggle with is doing voiceovers, but that problem is basically solved now because you can use AI voiceover tools and get clean, natural narration without recording anything yourself.\n\nOnce you know how to put together short promotional videos, product demos, before-and-after videos, or service explainers, you can sell monthly content bundles to small businesses. For example:\n\n10 short videos per month  \n2 long videos per month  \nA full video reel pack  \nSocial media formatted clips\n\nBusinesses love it because they need fresh content constantly, and you can deliver it quickly once you have a workflow. This skill is simple, fast to learn, and can become steady income because businesses often stay with you month after month.\n\nI also explain how to make voiceovers easily in my newsletter, link in my bio if you want more details.",

          "body": "I've been making a couple hundred each month just by looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than the cost. It's called bonus arbitrage. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

Don't know how this will work, but it's an idea.\n\nIn 2018, I helped do a journalism piece on modern slavery  for the show Ecologic on 99.5 WBAI Radio, NYC. I was researching for slavery in the palm oil industry, their enslavement  of people and environmental degradation from the plantations, but when you research,  you find other stuff. One of them was fake designer bags. They force slaves to make the bags with lead. The buyer slowly dies of lead poisoning because the dust is either inhaled,  absorbed through skin, or if you're a nail biter, through the mouth. The slaves can be children of hide and seek age. I had nightmares doing this story.\n\nSo, keeping stuff out of the landfill,  making designer goods cheap enough to compete with fakes, while helping the slaves and giving me pocket money  might be the answer to solve a horrific problem. Still learning how to do this , but there are bag flippers out there making a living. Might as well try.",

          "body": "One thing I've been doing is bonus arbitrage, which can probably make you a couple hundred each month. Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

Some of my best passive income successes in the past have been from dipping my spoon into the broader market, but I’d be hesitant to lean into it right now given the number of states that are enacting ID laws for accessing porn sites, which might as well be a porn ban. Likewise, at this point, there’s very little to stop the Project 2025 vision of making porn illegal within the next year a reality, and I would not be at all surprised if any businesses considered to be abetting the distribution of pornography to be held liable as well.\n \nSo, ignoring any moral objections you may have, strictly in terms of what’s going to be best for your business over the next three years or more, I don’t think leaning into it is the way. Maybe ten years ago but not in this budding dystopia we’re rolling into. If it were me, I’d monitor them to make sure they aren’t promoting or fronting for some truly rancid stuff, but leaning towards cutting quick if their presence is providing little relative benefit or limiting growth.

Just try and attract the right people and keep changing the product to better serve then and eventually the bad customers will filter themselves out. Hope this helps",

Amazon warehouse employees are at least paid but treated horrendously and not allowed to take bathroom breaks. Most restaurants use undocumented labor for their kitchen staff, which is not bad in my opinion, but as a result they often pay less than minimum wage which is morally wrong. Unfortunately, I could go on forever. In fact, I don’t know if I can name an industry that is 100% morally sound. \n\nA lot of modern porn is actually not too bad in terms of ethics. Obviously there are certainly porn sites that are not morally sound at all and some that violate legality. But a lot of popular modern porn sites are not only ethical, but empowering for the content creators! I feel like porn faced heavy scrutiny in the 2010’s after the documentary ‘Hot Girls Wanted’ exposed how awful it was, and as a result it has been reformed for the better.  Only Fans and Fansly for example, allows their creators freedom/control over their content, work conditions, and a very equitable share of the generated profits! The top 10% of creators on those sites likely make 6 figures, have full creative control over what type of content they make, and are protected from workplace harassment. It also can be a safe space, and excellent platform for lgbtqia people to not only express their sexuality, but monetize if. \n\nAgain, I’m sure there are definitely porn sites that are unethical, but I would go out on a limb and say that currently, porn is the most ethical that it has ever been, and is far from the worst industry. I would feel much worse about being involved in the real estate broker/foreclosure, predatory/payday loan, or healthcare industries than porn.",

I’ve taken loans out before but that just seems to make things worse. I am educated and savvy and willing to do just about anything to help pay my debts. I have not found luck with online games and I currently don’t have access to a laptop, which sucks. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you. ",

Everything in this life will be sufficient for you just give it time. I don’t know where you live, but my side hustle is I buy used pallets and sell them to pallet company’s. I’ve built relationships with people in my network that I know manages warehouses and most time I get the pallets for cheap (less than a $1) and sell them to pallet company’s for $4 who recycles it and sells it back for $7. Most company’s just want to get the pallets off their docks because that’s not their core business.",

          "body": "You can try bonus arbitrage, which can probably make you a couple hundred each month. Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

I'm an e-commerce seller myself, I started off with nothing but through collaborations with suppliers, I was able to build my firm to rake in thousands of sales per day. Ofc it took time, but I started off with nothing. Likewise, you can start exploring your niche of your interests, make a plan, start off with the lowest investment or collaborations if possible. I wouldn't say ecommerce, I meant anything, wherever your interest or expertise lay.\n\nRemember, everyone has their lowest phase of life, and its never permanent.

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’ve been doing KDP since August of 2024, a little over a year now. I started with nothing. Literally. No money, living out of my car. I want to share my full experience scaling this from $0 to $150K revenue. The lessons I learned, and why I think KDP is nowhere near saturated as many claim.\n\nMy hope is that this post will give you value, motivation, and perspective, especially if you’re just starting out or feel stuck.\n\n# A Little Background\n\nI’ve always been into business, ever since i was a kid flipping Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh cards and other collectibles, plus video game currencies, items, accounts. Over the years I’ve tried everything: forex, stock trading, affiliate marketing, SEO blogs, crypto, dropshipping, customer acquisition/lead generation agency, CPA marketing, SMMA, POD, and of course KDP.\n\nJust to keep in mind, this is not my first time doing KDP. My first attempt was in 2019, but my account got banned in early 2020 for a few (frustrating) reasons:\n\n* I used a term, that a few months later got filled for trademark and Amazon flagged me, even tho the trademark was just pending and was rejected later.\n* Got hit with a “similar cover” strike ( I should have fought it, probably would have won. Not sure why I didn’t.)\n* Published a book called “Snarky Nurse Coloring Book” with the idea that the book was snarky (snarky quotes), not the nurse. Tt got reported by a brand called Snarky Nurse or something similar.\n\nAfter the third strike, Amazon didn’t let me appeal or explain myself, they kept sending the same generic response that the decision is final and nothing could be done.\n\nAfter all this I didn’t do anything, I got comfortable, had plenty in savings, some other life events happened during covid that I lost any motivation to do anything, until life forced me to start again.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nI’m not smart or special. Many people make much more with KDP than I do. But I’ve failed a lot and learned from my mistakes, and treated this like a real business. What I’ll share is what worked for me. Hopefully you’ll learn something useful from it and get some clarity on how you should approach this business.\n\n# Quick Stats:\n\n* Started: August 2024.\n* Books Published 148. (1 book every 3 days or so)\n* Total Revenue: \\~$150,000\n* Ad Spend: \\~$16,000\n* Employee Costs: \\~$24,000\n* Tools &amp; Subscriptions: \\~$2,500\n* TikTok Marketing Videos: \\~2,000\n* Profit (before tax): \\~100,000\n\nLast month, I made \\~$32,000 revenue, with \\~$10,000 expenses.\n\n# Lessons, Tests &amp; Observations:\n\n1. **Quality vs. Quantity.** I’ve seen many YouTubers talk about focusing only on quality and to be honest I don’t fully agree. I started with quantity, not because I believed in mass publishing, but because I wanted data. I uploaded many somewhat decent quality books at first (most didn’t even hit 10 sales) and they helped me to identify which niches and formats had potential. Then I moved to more medium quality books, they took me 2-5 days each, in niches that showed potential and these confirmed the winners. I then outsourced even better versions and that’s where most of my revenue came from (excluding the unicorn). So it’s not quality or quantity, you need both to optimize your business.\n2. **Amazon ads.** I’m a numbers guy, I love data, tracking, testing everything. With amazon ads you obviously get more sales, but you also get an 20-30% bump in the organic sales. Sales boost your BSR, help you rank higher, which gets you more sales, more reviews, and all of this combined, a stronger foundation in the algorithm, making it more difficult for competitors to outrank you. So yes, ads are worth it, even beyond direct ROI. There’s another reason why I find ads even more important than getting sales. To be honest I didn’t even start them with the idea to make money from them directly. As I said, I love data, and amazon unfortunately shows you almost no valuable data at all. Running ads helps you a little bit as you can see the impressions you get, how many clicks you get and how many conversions, enough signal to see what’s working and what isn’t. It’s not ideal, but this is what we have to deal with when it comes to amazon.\n3. **Keywords.** Always use relevant keywords, leave fields if you don’t have anything relevant to add. I tested adding trending but not relevant keywords on a couple of books that had \\~20 sales a month each. Sales dropped to 4 and 6 the first month and 1 and 0 on the second month. Removing those irrelevant keywords didn’t restore the sales. Only running ads brought them back. Unrelated words hurt your relevance score, which can tank your book entirely\n4. **External ads.** I had some experimentation with meta ads, spend $600 and made \\~$450 above baseline over the next few months (sales doubled the month with the ads being run and slowly fell back to baseline). Still not enough data to fully judge, I’ll test this more, I need to spend at least $10,000 to have at least some opinion about this, and that’s what I’m going to do in the upcoming months.\n5. **A+ Content.** Almost always helps unless it’s really, really bad. I’ve tested many different layouts, worst ones had \\~10% increase in CVR, the best ones increased 80-150%, depending on the niche and design. Either way, it helps.\n6. **Cover Design (not just artsy, its psychology).** After niche selection, cover is the most important factor. People do judge a book by it’s cover If your design isn’t at least as good as top competitors in that niche, your book is gonna sink in the vast ocean that is Amazon. If you can afford it and your design skills aren’t great, I would suggest outsourcing covers to skilled designers. Still, do some of them yourself, to have a better understanding as not all of it is art, it’s more about the psychology of the customer, it is the pitch for your product. (Also the content of the book has to be good enough as well, because negative reviews can kill your book just as easily as bad cover, just a little slower).\n7. **Descriptions.** I’m not sure if I am just bad at writing them, but I never seen a big difference in CVR from it. The only thing that seems to matter in my experience is the formatting. The description still has to be informative and relevant to the book itself, but if it’s done in a big block of text it’s not gonna help. If it is formatted nicely, then I’ve seen 10-30% CVR improvements. The other thing that I’ve noticed is that having a relevant and informative description helps the book rank higher. It happened consistently enough to make me almost sure that Amazon’s algorithm rewards it.\n8. **Low Search Volume Niches (Small Margins Scale Big).** Pretty much every YouTube video I watched about KDP said to target niches that have high search volume of 1000+ at the minimum and ignore every one of them that get less. I often target niches other skip, even less than 500 searches per month. I care more about competitor strength and actual sales. If I feel I have a fighting chance against the competitor in that kind of niche, that has 100-200k BSR, then I’ll attack it. I get it, making books that are going to get 100-200 sales a month isn’t sexy, but over the year they make $1,200-$2,400, and ten, twenty, thirty, one hundred of these adds up to real income.\n9. **E-mail Lists.** These are great but I’ve only managed to make them work in two situations. In my unicorn niche, I built a list of 1,000+ via a variety of freebies. When I launched a supporting book with a release day discount, I emailed the list and got 200+ day one sales. I’m not saying that 20% of the email list converted, but even if 3-4% can create enough sales velocity to push the book up the rankings making it get even more sales and climb even higher up. Second, with my “client” brand (consumable books). We built the list by running promotional ads and in book freebies. After every weekly release, the email goes out and almost consistently gets 100 day one sales, some releases even get 200-300.\n10. **Short-Form Video Marketing.** One day I got bored and thought about trying out something new, I released a book in a very competitive niche(which means lot’s of interested people) and created a TikTok account to make videos for that book. After printing the book and recording a few videos, repurposing them, following trends, changing the hooks , etc., one video hit nearly 1m views. This led to over 2,000 sales in the first week after upload. Since then I’ve uploaded 250+ videos, hired other people to make videos for me and I’ve had a few other viral videos (not as bit as the original one tho).\n11. **Pricing.** Compete on the quality of your book rather than price, if your book is better than competitor’s, price it higher and position it as premium. Low price makes you look cheap, not “affordable”. The pricing is different depending on the niche and type of the book itself, so what I would recommend is to launch around the average competitor price, could be a little higher if you are confident in your book (that’s what I do), or price it just a little below the average. Monitor CVR, if it is solid, then increase the price by $1 and observe, if it gets too big of a hit, reverse the change if it doesn’t keep increasing the price. If the book ranks high, gets steady organic sales and reviews, push premium pricing.\n12. **99% of Gamblers Give Up Before They Hit it Big.** Okay, maybe not in gambling (please don’t). But in business? Mostly true. Most people give up right before they’ve learned enough both from theirs, and other people’s failures to make their business work. There’s plenty of money in almost every business. Imagine a gambler spinning the slots, after 30 failed spins, he hits jackpot. Business it’s similar, keep testing, keep learning, fail, tweak it, try again. Do that 30 times and on attempt 31 it suddenly looks like you “got lucky”(You didn’t. You just didn’t quit.) If you knew that you were 30 failures away from your dream, would you keep going?\n13. AI Tools as Assistants, Not Crutches Do not let AI do all the work for you. You won’t really learn what’s working and the quality will be subpar. People notice that the book was written by AI and leave negative reviews. Use it to brainstorm ideas, rough outlines, keyword ideas that you’re gonna validate, even sketch A+ layouts. Always double check the accuracy (AI likes to hallucinate) and IP. AI speeds you up, significantly, but it doesn’t do the job for you.\n14. **KDP plateau.** Plateaus do happen at every stage. I sat at a bit over $6,000 per month for a while, luckily for me it was a decent enough revenue to stay motivated. Some people, especially beginners, plateau at $0 per month, or they reach $500 in the first months, stall for a few months, assume “KDP is dead” and quit. It’s not. It’s just lag and learning. The move isn’t to quit, it’s to keep publishing and keep making small improvements. Eventually you’ll break out. Keep going, keep measuring, keep improving and then the compounding finally shows up.\n15. **Outsourcing and delegating.** All of this is going to depend on your budget and skill level. I hire people to go faster, not to disappear. I keep strategy, ads, research, final approval and hand off stuff like covers, interiors, basic edits, videos. I also do some books fully myself to keep improving and learning. At first you should do everything yourself, to learn as much as possible, to even know what to ask your employees to do, to be able to make SOPs for them. Eventually when you can no longer keep up with the amount of books you want to make, you start hiring. Track cost per title, have an idea on how fast the contractors work, how long it is going to take to make a book. Keep light PM Cadence, do weekly check-ins, have a QC checklist before anything goes live. Plan so that one person’s vacation doesn’t stall launches. Pay on time, give bonuses when earned, give specific feedback, promote your A-players.\n16. **Treat it like a real business and I mean REAL business.** KDP isn’t a lottery ticket, it’s a real publishing business. I budget, track unit economics and make decisions off numbers, not vibes. That means knowing your CTR/CVR, ACOS/TACOS, margin, payback time (how long till the book repays it’s investment), opportunity cost, LTV per title and more. Keep a simple P&amp;L, reinvest into ads, books, testing, learning. Write SOPs for contractors, kill or fix anything that doesn’t earn its shelf space. Manage your cashflow, plan for seasonality, keep runway for tests, don’t starve the winners. Be boringly safe on ToS/IP and make sure to set aside money for taxes. Real business = clear goals, clean and tight processes, consistent iteration.\n17. **You need action much more than you need information.** Most people don’t have a knowledge problem, they have a doing problem. You can binge every KDP video, read every post in KDP forums and still have $0 in royalties because you never uploaded anything. On top of that you’re gonna forget most of the stuff you watched either way if you do not try to implement it almost immediately. When and if you’ll start taking action, you’ll go back and start rewatching those videos again with context. Learn just enough to take action. By taking action you’ll learn the most. Half baked action beats perfect research because market teaches faster than any tutorial. Most importantly be consistent with your action, and consistently improve with it.\n\n# Key Takeaways\n\nKDP is not oversaturated. People said that it was already “too late” back in 2019 when I first started, and they’ll say the same in 2030. The real difference is how you treat KDP. Treat it like a real business. Track data. Build Systems. Reinvest Profits. TEST RELENTLESSLY. Be consistent and improve every week. Stagnation is death, and even to maintain you level, you have to keep evolving because the competition is. Plan your week. Every Sunday, I write down my tasks and deadlines. And I need to do them. No excuses. That habit alone kept me on track for 60-70 hours a week for over a year.\n\n# My Goals for the Future\n\nThis December my plan is to get to $100,000 - the coveted six figure month. I know it’s possible, because December sales can triple or quadruple.  \nBut my goals don’t stop here.\n\n**My next milestone for 2026:**  \n$1,000,000 in total revenue  \n$253k+ in December 2026 alone.  \nThe reason for that specific figure is that back in 2020 I spoke with someone who made $252K in December 2019 with a team consisting of her and her husband. I’m going to have a bigger team than that to try to hit this number, but let’s ignore that fact.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis year has been life-changing. I went from being broke and sleeping in my car to running a six figure publishing business. I don’t think that this was luck. It was consistency, constant improvement, and treating KDP like the serious business it is. If you’re reading this and were thinking about quitting. DON’T. Keep going, test things, learn from your data, stay disciplined. Do not think “What if it’s not going work out? What if I fail?”. Think “What if everything does work out?”.",

Its not that I cannot do it, its just that I wish I didnt have to.

I have many questions for you, hope you'll take a bit if your precious time to answer my questions.\n\n1) For this one, it's not really for you but for those commenters that saying you're using AI or you gave vague answers. I need to push it at no 1 because I don't think those people will have energy to read my essay till the end. Well, if they read, so here :\n\nIt's funny and sad how you saw this long ass explanations that you can't fathom what they're talking about, but still want to leave something so that the OP can experience a tenth of your miserable life by commenting that they're using AI or focusing on their vague answer eventhough actually their answer is make sense eventhough not straighforward, if you can read comprehensively.\n\n2) Now back to the topic. Most of your points eg: using ads and outsorcing the books, I'd assume you start to use those when you hit with good enough revenue. May I know how you started getting your first sale? Did you list the books and then wish for the best or you use ads from the start? Is it possible to just list out our product and just wait until some people interested to buy it? Or we still need to do some promotion? How about initial review, did you applly that for your book or you let review grew organically?\n\n3) You have more than 100 books, may I know if all of those from the same niche or different ones? If different, do you separate to different pen names that suitable for those niches or combine it under the same pen name?\n\n4) What software /system / service that you use for creating the low and medium content, and also high content. Eg: for high content youd need software or something to rearrange the format to make as book is it?\n\n5) As for the pricing, how would you decide the price? Based on content, word counts or pages? Eg for price 14.99, is it must be within 100 pages (for low content) and like 30k words (for high content)? What's your standard in pricing?\n\n6) Do you focusing on physical books or also ebook /audiobook? If including ebook and audiobook, do you have plan to create your own website to sell those? I mean, you'd increase the margin or something right?\n\n7) Are all your books use ISBN from Amazon or you bought your own? Would you keep using amazon kdp for it's trafic and book logistic convenience or you might venture out for proper publication?\n\n8) What's your opinion on untapped niches? Do you think it's untapped for a reason aka low or no demand, or it's still undiscovered because it's combination of different niches so it's a hard for people who's copying what niche works to create their own opportunity?\n\nI really appreciate it if you could answer all my curiosities. I'm interested to start amazon KDP with too much ideas but too little time and courage kinda hold me back. But reading your post make me think that it's not impossible for me to just start. Thank you for your time.\n\nP/s : sorry if there's any grammar mistake or whatever some people gonna be picky about, English is not my first language.",

      "selftext": "Forget building elaborate automated systems. My actual goal was far simpler: I just wanted to stop micro-managing every single one of my side hustles.\n\nMy first foray into automation began with a basic reminder. I simply scheduled a weekly alert for Fridays to relist a handful of Etsy products that were losing visibility. This minimal effort, taking barely two minutes, proved surprisingly effective at preventing a significant drop in traffic.\n\nNext, I integrated auto-scheduling for Pinterest. I simply took my existing designs, configured them to loop every few weeks, and pushed them out. There was no specific optimization. Yet, these automatically recycled posts began generating a consistent flow of clicks.\n\nMy next step involved a more technical approach: I developed a simple script to programmatically reindex older blog pages via Google’s API. While it sounds complex, its primary purpose was to automate a task I disliked performing manually. Once confirmed operational, I promptly ceased thinking about it.\n\nThis pattern became a clear directive, every instance of successful automation stemmed from a reluctance to perform repetitive, unstimulating tasks manually.\n\nSo now, the Etsy listings just auto-renew, the pins repost themselves, the old pages get reindexed... and this little ecosystem just keeps generating a handful of random sales or clicks each week. It's never anything massive, but it totally adds up, enough for coffee, a nice little rent buffer, and honestly, a whole lot of peace of mind.\n\nEveryone out there talks about 'passive income' like it's this glorious, sprawling system you build once and then, boom, you retire to a beach. For me? It's way more like a messy pile of half-automated chores that just quietly chug along in the background while I'm off doing literally anything else.\n\nIt's undoubtedly chaotic, lacking any aesthetic appeal, and occasionally requires troubleshooting. Yet, its consistent contribution to my rent makes it entirely satisfactory.\n\n",

Dollar-cost averaging beats market timing - You invest the same amount regularly, regardless of market conditions. When prices are high, you buy fewer shares. When prices are low, you buy more. Over time, this averages out your purchase price and removes emotional decision-making.  \n  \n2. Low-cost index funds beat active management - Over 90% of active fund managers underperform the market over 15+ years (check the SPIVA scorecards yourself). Index funds track the entire market with fees around 0.1-0.3% annually instead of 1-2%+ for active funds. That difference compounds massively.  \n  \n3.

          "body": "I have been using the Vibecode app for a bit, so here is a straight answer.\nVibecode is more than a UI mockup tool. It generates actual mobile apps using React Native and Expo under the hood, and you can run them on your phone, not just click through static screens.\nI built a small mobile MVP with it that had email based login, saved user data, simple logic like tracking streaks and progress, and a couple of external API calls with basic tracking. That was enough to share the app with real users and collect feedback. All of that was done inside Vibecode without opening a traditional code editor.\nFrom what I have seen, it does well when your app is fairly straightforward. Things like auth, basic CRUD, simple conditions, and a few APIs are very doable. When you start asking for more unusual or complex workflows, it takes more effort to get what you want, and it helps a lot if you already understand how apps and data flows work.\nSo to answer the original question in practical terms:\nYes, Vibecode can build a real, functional mobile app, not just a visual prototype. It is a solid option if you want to get an MVP on a phone quickly and see how users react. If the app grows and you need heavy custom logic or long term maintainability, you will probably end up refining the generated code or bringing in a more traditional setup later, but that is a next step, not a blocker for getting started.",

Launches fast. The only issue I have is that edge cases and hyper custom logic sometimes needs tweaking after the app generates it, but that's honestly expected... You're not locked into what it outputs though as you can export and edit if needed.\n\nFor an MVP? Really freakin' solid. You'll have something real in days. The question is whether you want to spend time customizing stuff after or if the initial build is 80% of what you need anyway. You can then use vibe coders like Claude or Gemini Pro (hell, even GPT5 is decent) to finish the rest. \n\nBiggest thing I'd say is, try it for your specific use case first. Some app ideas are perfect for AI builders, others need custom development. But you'll know pretty quick once you start building.\n\nHope that helps.",

You spend a month or two fixing it up after your normal job’s workday (which I actually find fun bc it is grounding and I live in my head too much with my job).   Then you rent it out. Yes a/c’s break. Roofs leak. Plumbing gets backed up. Often at inconvenient times. \n\nBut partly what makes those repairs a pain is that for the most part for months at a time, you’re not doing anything to or for a property. It actually is so passive it makes you lazy.  Then at the height of your comfort or laziness, a toilet backs up. Big deal, you call a plumber or you try to fix it yourself. \n\nAnyway, just want to point out that work you like doing is itself sort of passive. So be sure to search for that too…",

You have to commit yourself against any kind of fun for a while, but eventually your mind changes and it gets easier.\n\nYou’ll see friends going to bars, clubs, fun, and festivals. Some won’t talk with you anymore because you can’t do what they are. you’ll miss trips, you won’t take vacation, you’ll not get kids important to you the exact thing you wanted. You’ll be embarrassed. You’ll have to eat the free lunch anytime it’s available. You’ll need to not eat out, clip coupons, make your own coffee, not get a convenient snack at the gas station. You have to be a little hungry til you’re home. Going somewhere for fun? It’s the park with your feet.\n\nYou’ll do this for a minimum of three years, and the rest of the world will be having a WAY better time.\n\nYear one starts slow. Agonizing. It’s $10 to a broker account a week. Maybe $50 if things went alright. Your friends are hitting you up but you’re not going. Month goes by. You’re suddenly craving your favorite Chinese spot, and damn you have $200 extra, can’t you slide some over? NO. You can’t. Because you looked up some monthly dividend-payers and that $200 is about to pay you $5. That Amazon movie you want to see is $4.99, perfect! FUCK NO.\n\nYou’re 6 months in, damn, you were able to save a grand, where did that come from? You can afford a little splurge, right? There’s a charter that’s $180 to take you fishing and you just got paid - why don’t you go? Well now your $5 dividend-paying stock that cost you $200 had some NAV erosion and it’s $185. You make the painful smart choice to buy another. Single. Stock. Because now you’re making another whole $5 this month and it was $15 off.\n\nAbout this point you realize how expensive it is to actually buy your own time back. So you start running the numbers. You want $10/hr? Congrats you have now accumulated around $1400 in your $5 dividend-paying account spread across 7 total stocks. You have bought yourself 3.5 hours of work at $10/hr.\n\nYou realize no one can live on $10/hr without support, and life really wants around $25-30.\n\nYou really only gained an hour, it’s November. Christmas is coming, last Christmas sucked, you have over a grand, your partner is upset you’re not living like everyone else… but you *did* get an extra hour of work out of every month.\n\nNext year, you try harder, you get a second job. You diversify. You find there are weekly payers. You get them for a quick dopamine hit. it’s good for a bit to see that cash every week. Then someone on TV says something they don’t mean and your portfolio tumbles, you stopped your steady $5/month payer and had it all in weekly payers, you got greedy and didn’t know what you were buying, so you cash out, taking a little tax hit and bruising your ego. You’re kicking yourself, you don’t want to tell your partner you just set yourself back two months.\n\nJust then, new tech! Your weeklies raise and you’re already out. You want back but you know better, and two weeks later, you were glad you didn’t buy the news, it’s crashed even lower.\n\nYou feel smart, but you couldn’t have really known though. You’re more uncertain, your money is in the hands of billionaires through your broker. They don’t give a shit about you. They could wipe your account at any time (it’s in the terms but you didn’t read them at first).\n\nYou start to realize you need custody, that is your money. You learn about Direct Registration, where shares are ACTUALLY held in your name - under your SSN, not a broker. We’re rolling up on the third year here….\n\nYou now own your shares. The company you bought them from issues you a check now for the dividends, or reinvests it. You’re making steady gains, you’re buying dips, you’re making a hundred extra a month. You bought 3-4 hours of your time back and it only took 3 years! \n\nNow everything looks different. You don’t go to the weed shop and get two cartridges, you don’t smoke at all because that’s cutting into paying yourself faster. You’ve actually dropped a few habits because they were expensive.\n\nAll your friends are broke and complaining, you’re just quiet because you stacked - but you’re still not done… because in just a few months you’re on your way to $185 a month in dividends, which you’re putting right towards those nice stocks that always hang around $180, and FINALLY you’re getting some compounding.\n\nAnd you still can’t spend that because God only knows what’s around the corner.\n\nIt can be done, it’s FUCKING HARD.\n\nI don’t do much in stocks anymore, I took a good chunk of what I made (except long term plays) and mine Bitcoin now, but you didn’t want promotion, so there’s a stock story.",

Social media things, apps, or e-books seem to be posted often, but that’s not passive at all. Like if you make an app then you’re a literal developer. That’s a job. If you write a book then you’re a writer. If you’re a social media influencer then you’re an entertainer.  \n\nI would argue that just because something provides residual income doesn’t make it passive, and many things still require pretty significant upkeep even after they’re “launched.”  \n\nAs others have said, traditional investments like stocks, dividends, and CDs are truly the most passive thing I can think of, but that of course requires a nest egg of money to start with. \n\nThat being said, it’s much easier to make money from a regular job and then dump it into a stable dividend stock than it is to learn how to write a book or an app if you don’t have any experience with that sort of thing.",

You can build systems that feels passive, like digital products, affiliate links, or automated funnels, but they still need tweaks to keep performing.

          "body": "Bonus arbitrage is a decent side hustle that can make you an extra couple hundred each month. You look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

          "body": "Mining is not really worth it anymore unless you have a huge setup, and even then the profit is tiny.\n\nA much better option is creating short marketing videos for small businesses. Every business today needs video content for Instagram, TikTok, ads, and even Google listings. Restaurants, barbershops, gyms, coffee shops, real estate agents, and online stores all need simple videos to promote their services.\n\nThe good thing is that you do not need to film anything yourself. You can use stock footage, templates, and AI tools to create professional looking videos quickly. The part that used to be the most difficult, the voiceover, is now solved easily with AI voiceover tools, so you can generate clean narration without recording anything.\n\nYour computer becomes your production machine. You can offer monthly video bundles to local businesses, and many will pay because they always need fresh content.\n\nThis is far more profitable and realistic than trying to use your PC for mining.\n\nI also explain more in my blog posts.

You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

The market is already quite saturated, but it is still possible to earn a small, steady income each month.\n\nI sell line art drawings on Etsy, mainly focusing on animal breeds (especially dogs) and classic cars. The process is very straightforward. Start by choosing a good niche. Animals are always a reliable option. Gather a collection of images online, then use a conversion website to turn them into clean line art. You can bundle these designs and sell them on Etsy or in Facebook groups.\n\nOffering custom work can be even more profitable. You can convert customers’ personal photos into line art for a higher fee. The site I use costs about ten cents per conversion, and you can charge a few dollars for premade bundles or five to fifteen dollars for custom conversions.\n\nYou can also do seasonal images like a bunch of different characters for Xmas for example",

Create a totally new email account (gmail I think is the best, and never do NOT use your real email)\n2. Expose your email publicly, so like write your email on any kind of forum, blogs... everywhere... so main idea here is for spammer parsers to find your email and just include it in their spam list. Here you could focus on niche, like expose email just on money maker forums for example\n3. Find some affiliate network that offers Pay Per Download, so if someone will download via your affiliate link - you earn money\n4. Upload to that affiliate network a couple of files, like image/png, pdf... and most important give them a real name like Fullname Password front, Bank account statement... and so on... so like to look like a real one\n5. The most important... for your email create a vacation autoreply to all, and here just create a nice message but not like a vacation reply, but to look more real, like replying to a real email... so like thank you, I’m glad I finally won something bla bla... and like in the end attach all the links to the affiliate downloaded files... so like to mention, here are my password front photo... here is my bank statement... so main idea is for the spammer to really think that you believed him and you sent him back real info\n\n...and then just wait for results... I mean you could just forget about these emails... it will work automatically for you\n\nso again, this is just one of my theoretical ideas that I’m not even sure will work at all...\n\nmaybe here someone will want to try or maybe tried something before and wants to share thoughts on this...",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I posted this in another subreddit and I got some heartwarming messages that it inspired them, so I'm going to share this with you, hopefully it can inspire some of you as well. (I don't have anything to sell, don't worry.)\n\nI’ve been doing Amazon KDP (Amazon's self publishing platform) since August of 2024, a little over a year now. It is possible to do it on the side, I didn't because I started with nothing. Literally. No money, living out of my car, and I needed to do something about my situation. I want to share my full experience scaling this from $0 to $150K revenue. The lessons I learned, and why I think KDP is nowhere near saturated as many claim.\n\nMy hope is that this post will give you value, motivation, and perspective, especially if you’re just starting out or feel stuck.\n\n# A Little Background\n\nI’ve always been into business, ever since i was a kid flipping Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh cards and other collectibles, plus video game currencies, items, accounts. Over the years I’ve tried everything: forex, stock trading, affiliate marketing, SEO blogs, dropshipping, customer acquisition/lead generation agency, CPA marketing, SMMA, POD, and of course KDP.\n\nJust to keep in mind, this is not my first time doing KDP. My first attempt was in 2019, but my account got banned in early 2020 for a few (frustrating) reasons:\n\n* I used a term, that a few months later got filled for trademark and Amazon flagged me, even tho the trademark was just pending and was rejected later.\n* Got hit with a “similar cover” strike ( I should have fought it, probably would have won. Not sure why I didn’t.)\n* Published a book called “Snarky Nurse Coloring Book” with the idea that the book was snarky (snarky quotes), not the nurse. Tt got reported by a brand called Snarky Nurse or something similar.\n\nAfter the third strike, Amazon didn’t let me appeal or explain myself, they kept sending the same generic response that the decision is final and nothing could be done.\n\nAfter all this I didn’t do anything, I got comfortable, had plenty in savings, some other life events happened during covid that I lost any motivation to do anything, until life forced me to start again.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nI’m not smart or special. Many people make much more with KDP than I do. But I’ve failed a lot, learned from my mistakes, and treated this like a real business. What I’ll share is what worked for me. Hopefully you’ll learn something useful from it and get some clarity on how you should approach this business if you decide to give it a shot.\n\n# Quick Stats:\n\n* Started: August 2024.\n* Books Published 148. (1 book every 3 days or so)\n* Total Revenue: \\~$150,000\n* Ad Spend: \\~$16,000\n* Employee Costs: \\~$24,000\n* Tools &amp; Subscriptions: \\~$2,500\n* TikTok Marketing Videos: \\~2,000\n* Profit (before tax): \\~100,000\n\nLast month, I made \\~$32,000 revenue, with \\~$10,000 in expenses.\n\n# Lessons, Tests &amp; Observations:\n\n1. **Quality vs. Quantity.** I’ve seen many YouTubers talk about focusing only on quality and to be honest I don’t fully agree. I started with quantity, not because I believed in mass publishing, but because I wanted data. I uploaded many somewhat decent quality books at first (most didn’t even hit 10 sales) and they helped me to identify which niches and formats had potential. Then I moved to more medium quality books, they took me 2-5 days each, in niches that showed potential and these confirmed the winners. I then outsourced even better versions and that’s where most of my revenue came from (excluding the unicorn). So it’s not quality or quantity, you need both to optimize your business.\n2. **Amazon ads.** I’m a numbers guy, I love data, tracking, testing everything. With amazon ads you obviously get more sales, but you also get an 20-30% bump in the organic sales. Sales boost your BSR, help you rank higher, which gets you more sales, more reviews, and all of this combined, a stronger foundation in the algorithm, making it more difficult for competitors to outrank you. So yes, ads are worth it, even beyond direct ROI. There’s another reason why I find ads even more important than getting sales. To be honest I didn’t even start them with the idea to make money from them directly. As I said, I love data, and amazon unfortunately shows you almost no valuable data at all. Running ads helps you a little bit as you can see the impressions you get, how many clicks you get and how many conversions, enough signal to see what’s working and what isn’t. It’s not ideal, but this is what we have to deal with when it comes to amazon.\n3. **Keywords.** Always use relevant keywords, leave fields if you don’t have anything relevant to add. I tested adding trending but not relevant keywords on a couple of books that had \\~20 sales a month each. Sales dropped to 4 and 6 the first month and 1 and 0 on the second month. Removing those irrelevant keywords didn’t restore the sales. Only running ads brought them back. Unrelated words hurt your relevance score, which can tank your book entirely\n4. **External ads.** I had some experimentation with meta ads, spend $600 and made \\~$450 above baseline over the next few months (sales doubled the month with the ads being run and slowly fell back to baseline). Still not enough data to fully judge, I’ll test this more, I need to spend at least $10,000 to have at least some opinion about this, and that’s what I’m going to do in the upcoming months.\n5. **A+ Content.** Almost always helps unless it’s really, really bad. I’ve tested many different layouts, worst ones had \\~10% increase in CVR, the best ones increased 80-150%, depending on the niche and design. Either way, it helps.\n6. **Cover Design (not just artsy, its psychology).** After niche selection, cover is the most important factor. People do judge a book by it’s cover If your design isn’t at least as good as top competitors in that niche, your book is gonna sink in the vast ocean that is Amazon. If you can afford it and your design skills aren’t great, I would suggest outsourcing covers to skilled designers. Still, do some of them yourself, to have a better understanding as not all of it is art, it’s more about the psychology of the customer, it is the pitch for your product. (Also the content of the book has to be good enough as well, because negative reviews can kill your book just as easily as bad cover, just a little slower).\n7. **Descriptions.** I’m not sure if I am just bad at writing them, but I never seen a big difference in CVR from it. The only thing that seems to matter in my experience is the formatting. The description still has to be informative and relevant to the book itself, but if it’s done in a big block of text it’s not gonna help. If it is formatted nicely, then I’ve seen 10-30% CVR improvements. The other thing that I’ve noticed is that having a relevant and informative description helps the book rank higher. It happened consistently enough to make me almost sure that Amazon’s algorithm rewards it.\n8. **Low Search Volume Niches (Small Margins Scale Big).** Pretty much every YouTube video I watched about KDP said to target niches that have high search volume of 1000+ at the minimum and ignore every one of them that get less. I often target niches other skip, even less than 500 searches per month. I care more about competitor strength and actual sales. If I feel I have a fighting chance against the competitor in that kind of niche, that has 100-200k BSR, then I’ll attack it. I get it, making books that are going to get 100-200 sales a month isn’t sexy, but over the year they make $1,200-$2,400, and ten, twenty, thirty, one hundred of these adds up to real income.\n9. **E-mail Lists.** These are great but I’ve only managed to make them work in two situations. In my unicorn niche, I built a list of 1,000+ via a variety of freebies. When I launched a supporting book with a release day discount, I emailed the list and got 200+ day one sales. I’m not saying that 20% of the email list converted, but even if 3-4% can create enough sales velocity to push the book up the rankings making it get even more sales and climb even higher up. Second, with my “client” brand (consumable books). We built the list by running promotional ads and in book freebies. After every weekly release, the email goes out and almost consistently gets 100 day one sales, some releases even get 200-300.\n10. **Short-Form Video Marketing.** One day I got bored and thought about trying out something new, I released a book in a very competitive niche(which means lot’s of interested people) and created a TikTok account to make videos for that book. After printing the book and recording a few videos, repurposing them, following trends, changing the hooks , etc., one video hit nearly 1m views. This led to over 2,000 sales in the first week after upload. Since then I’ve uploaded 250+ videos, hired other people to make videos for me and I’ve had a few other viral videos (not as bit as the original one tho).\n11. **Pricing.** Compete on the quality of your book rather than price, if your book is better than competitor’s, price it higher and position it as premium. Low price makes you look cheap, not “affordable”. The pricing is different depending on the niche and type of the book itself, so what I would recommend is to launch around the average competitor price, could be a little higher if you are confident in your book (that’s what I do), or price it just a little below the average. Monitor CVR, if it is solid, then increase the price by $1 and observe, if it gets too big of a hit, reverse the change if it doesn’t keep increasing the price. If the book ranks high, gets steady organic sales and reviews, push premium pricing.\n12. **99% of Gamblers Give Up Before They Hit it Big.** Okay, maybe not in gambling (please don’t). But in business? Mostly true. Most people give up right before they’ve learned enough both from theirs, and other people’s failures to make their business work. There’s plenty of money in almost every business. Imagine a gambler spinning the slots, after 30 failed spins, he hits jackpot. Business it’s similar, keep testing, keep learning, fail, tweak it, try again. Do that 30 times and on attempt 31 it suddenly looks like you “got lucky”(You didn’t. You just didn’t quit.) If you knew that you were 30 failures away from your dream, would you keep going?\n13. AI Tools as Assistants, Not Crutches Do not let AI do all the work for you. You won’t really learn what’s working and the quality will be subpar. People notice that the book was written by AI and leave negative reviews. Use it to brainstorm ideas, rough outlines, keyword ideas that you’re gonna validate, even sketch A+ layouts. Always double check the accuracy (AI likes to hallucinate) and IP. AI speeds you up, significantly, but it doesn’t do the job for you.\n14. **KDP plateau.** Plateaus do happen at every stage. I sat at a bit over $6,000 per month for a while, luckily for me it was a decent enough revenue to stay motivated. Some people, especially beginners, plateau at $0 per month, or they reach $500 in the first months, stall for a few months, assume “KDP is dead” and quit. It’s not. It’s just lag and learning. The move isn’t to quit, it’s to keep publishing and keep making small improvements. Eventually you’ll break out. Keep going, keep measuring, keep improving and then the compounding finally shows up.\n15. **Outsourcing and delegating.** All of this is going to depend on your budget and skill level. I hire people to go faster, not to disappear. I keep strategy, ads, research, final approval and hand off stuff like covers, interiors, basic edits, videos. I also do some books fully myself to keep improving and learning. At first you should do everything yourself, to learn as much as possible, to even know what to ask your employees to do, to be able to make SOPs for them. Eventually when you can no longer keep up with the amount of books you want to make, you start hiring. Track cost per title, have an idea on how fast the contractors work, how long it is going to take to make a book. Keep light P M Cadence, do weekly check-ins, have a QC checklist before anything goes live. Plan so that one person’s vacation doesn’t stall launches. Pay on time, give bonuses when earned, give specific feedback, promote your A-players.\n16. **Treat it like a real business and I mean REAL business.** KDP isn’t a lottery ticket, it’s a real publishing business. I budget, track unit economics and make decisions off numbers, not vibes. That means knowing your CTR/CVR, ACOS/TACOS, margin, payback time (how long till the book repays it’s investment), opportunity cost, LTV per title and more. Keep a simple P&amp;L, reinvest into ads, books, testing, learning. Write SOPs for contractors, kill or fix anything that doesn’t earn its shelf space. Manage your cashflow, plan for seasonality, keep runway for tests, don’t starve the winners. Be boringly safe on ToS/IP and make sure to set aside money for taxes. Real business = clear goals, clean and tight processes, consistent iteration.\n17. **You need action much more than you need information.** Most people don’t have a knowledge problem, they have a doing problem. You can binge every KDP video, read every post in KDP forums and still have $0 in royalties because you never uploaded anything. On top of that you’re gonna forget most of the stuff you watched either way if you do not try to implement it almost immediately. When and if you’ll start taking action, you’ll go back and start rewatching those videos again with context. Learn just enough to take action. By taking action you’ll learn the most. Half baked action beats perfect research because market teaches faster than any tutorial. Most importantly be consistent with your action, and consistently improve with it.\n\n# Key Takeaways\n\nKDP is not oversaturated. People said that it was already “too late” back in 2019 when I first started, and they’ll say the same in 2030. The real difference is how you treat KDP. Treat it like a real business. Track data. Build Systems. Reinvest Profits. TEST RELENTLESSLY. Be consistent and improve every week. Stagnation is death, and even to maintain your level, you have to keep evolving because the competition is evolving. Plan your week. Every Sunday, I write down my tasks and deadlines. And I need to do them. No excuses. That habit alone kept me on track for 60-70 hours a week for over a year.\n\n# My Goals for the Future\n\nThis December my plan is to get to $100,000 - the coveted six figure month. I know it’s possible, because December sales can triple or quadruple.  \nBut my goals don’t stop here.\n\n**My next milestone for 2026:**  \n$1,000,000 in total revenue  \n$253k+ in December 2026 alone.  \nThe reason for that specific figure is that back in 2020 I spoke with someone who made $252K in December 2019 with a team consisting of her and her husband. I’m going to have a bigger team than that to try to hit this number, but let’s ignore that fact.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis year has been life-changing. I went from being broke and sleeping in my car to running a six figure publishing business. I don’t think that this was luck. It was consistency, constant improvement, and treating KDP like the serious business it is. If you’re reading this and were thinking about quitting. DON’T. Keep going, test things, learn from your data, stay disciplined. Do not think “What if it’s not going work out? What if I fail?”. Think “What if everything does work out?”.",

I have a couple of questions:\n1.\tWhere did you outsource your book, and how much did it cost per month?\n2.\tDid you use Google Analytics to check the search volume?\n3.\tI have my own KDP account, but I haven’t been able to get any sales without using Amazon ads. Most of the advice I read or watch on YouTube always involves outsourcing, subscribing to tools, or running ads in order to produce a quality book and generate more sales. With a very small budget, it feels almost impossible to succeed in this business. You mentioned you were broke before, so I’m curious how did you manage your budget in the beginning?",

Ads, as you can see, are now live on the site and have been for about 10 days.\n\nSo far, the RPMs are abysmal, only getting around $4 session RPM. I was hoping for $10 but this seems a bit far fetched for now.\n\nThat said, RPMs should increase as Mediavine continues to optimize ad placement and I hopefully continue to increase traffic. \n\nI am in their lowest rev share tier (75%) right now and this can get as high as 90%. \n\nBut in order to hit those tiers, I will have to significantly increase traffic - and I have done a bad job at that this month.\n\nMonthly traffic is still at 31k sessions, so no increase since the last update. \n\nWith the desktop app and especially with ads, this is all about scaling traffic (assuming I retain the same share of tier 1 country visitors). \n\nFor November, the tool site will probably make around $300 with sales of the app and ads. Idea is to reinvest every cent the side project makes into linkbuilding and maybe a few YouTube sponsorships (for the desktop app) down the line. \n\nStarting this, I always knew that it would be a 10 year side project and that the first few years would be somewhat slow.\n\nBut with ads now live, I am more confident than ever that I'll eventually get this to $10k in monthly revenue!",

If they viewed 4 pages it would be $1, and so on?

      "selftext": "I hit a point where reposting the same clip across a bunch of platforms was eating way too much time. So I ended up building something that handles it for me. It’s called [Repostify ](https://repostify.io/)and it pushes my short-form videos to , Instagram, YouTube Shorts, X, LinkedIn and a few others without me doing anything.\n\nCurious if anyone else here has tried automating this part of their workflow.\n\nI know you *can* rig something together with AI agents or custom scripts, but every setup I found felt like a dissertation project. Eventually I got tired of fiddling with it.\n\nHere’s why I even bothered. If you’re creating content today, you’re basically competing with teams who have full-time people pumping out posts. If you’re solo, the only real way to keep up is to remove as much manual work as possible. And reposting is one of the easiest wins.\n\nDifferent platforms have totally different algorithms. A clip can flop on one app and blow up on another. When I built the first version of this thing, [one of my videos got a million+ views on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_cVmRzoq4m/), then quietly did even better on[  without me even realising it had gone live.](https://www.tiktok.com/@bingedietitian/video/7114026377346649350) Meanwhile it barely moved on YouTube, and that contrast is exactly why I think multi-posting matters. Different platforms, different luck.\n\nIf you want reach, you can’t bet on one feed. You need volume and distribution. Whether you do it manually or use something automated doesn’t matter, as long as you’re everywhere.\n\nQuick note since people always ask: this isn’t a scheduler. I actually can’t stand schedulers. The tool just connects your accounts, detects when you’ve posted a short natively, and then copies it over to the other platforms with the captions. No queues, no dashboards. Just post once and it ripples out.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone’s curious or already doing something similar.\n\n",

And I'm scared that I won't make barely enough money when running the business. Will it even be worth it? My prices seem high compared to the market. I still have loads to do with only 7 weeks of time ahead until I officially launch. I still have to wait on my supplier to send me info, and they're not really responding adequately anymore. I feel like they don't take me serious, maybe they're actually just very busy. But I will do anything to start out this business. I want this to succeed no matter what.",

It's been fun, interesting, painful, uncertain, and after 15 years of struggle, profitable.\n\nI didn't become a entrepreneur because I wanted too, I kind of fell into it. It just made sense and I kept going. I hated the idea of being a businessman as a kid. But I was good with computers, and good with people, so eventually I capitalized. There was a pivotal moment between me being a US Customs Agent and a Business Owner, I fell into an industry I realized I could capitalize on.\n\nIt has been a long and hard road with lots of losses along the way. I put off having a family because I literally had no time.

High risk, high reward. If you like your personal time, stay out of it because you will have none for a long time, and there is no guarantee it will work out.\n\nBut the benefits on success, and the satisfaction are definately worth it if you can see it through.",

          "body": "I can't agree with this in any level. There is no such thing as a person that can't deal with uncertainty, managing money or that needs constant validation - there just are people that can't do that stuff RIGHT NOW, because that's where they are, who they believe they are and who they choose to be in the future.\n\nThe key is personal growth. It sounds cliche because so many wannabe coaches preach it, but it is true. Just imagine who you were as a child. There is very little of that person in you right now. You changed. The only difference is that most of those changes happen by accident, while the most necessary changes must happen by choice.\n\nOnce you decide to change, you have to act. If you want to learn how to deal with uncertainty, well, put yourself in risky situations. Put your money in small caps, buy cripto, start a side hustle. Assess where you fuck up and learn. If you want to learn how to manage money, well, save and try to manage money. Buy courses, read books on the subject. Assess where you fuck up and learn. If you crave external validation, go to therapy and put yourself in situations in which people doubt you. Assess where you fuck up and learn. Every failure in your journey will hurt - some of them will hurt a lot. Assess the pain, learn and move on.\n\nWhere people go wrong is that they listen to their ego and unsuccessful people, let fear take over their decision rationale, fail to take ownership and responsibility and develop a flawed thought process in which they try as hard as possible to seek comfort and avoid pain. That leads to stagnation, frustration and resentment.\n\nGrowth is in failure and pain. Success is what you attain after you become the person who withstood and rose above those challenges.\n\nIn case you are wondering, this isn't some coaching bullshit. I became a much bettern partner after my first wife divorced me, I went to therapy and owned my shit. I became a better professional after 10 years of service in a company that pushed me as far as I could go. I learned how to build a business after blowing up a failed venture and going bankrupt. It all hurt like fucking hell at the time. I went through depression, substance abuse and all that jazz. I had to decide to get better. Things only got better once I put myself in the driver seat of my own life. If I did it, anyone can. I'm just a random dude from a midsized city in a third world country. ",

Even when I fucked up, it was MY fuckup to learn from.\n\n\n\nHaving said that,  I also ran out of money and had to close it. I trusted the wrong people with my finances and lost control.

          "body": "Okay. Long rant ahead.\n\nReal wealth is discretionary time. I’ve run my own solo consulting practice for 15 years and here’s the truth most people don’t want to admit.\n\nMost folks hand over their entire life for a paycheck they don’t even like. They stay in jobs that drain them. They stay in marriages that have been dead, sexless, miserable for years - or for the “sake of the children.” One day they’ll  leave once the kids are grown up. They call it “security” while trading away the only thing they can’t earn back.\n\nAnd the punchline is cruel. By the time they finally “can” live, they’ve forgotten how. By the time, its time to retire, 60-70% of your life is OVER. It's the third quarter and you’re exhausted.\n\nWorking for yourself isn’t magic. It’s ownership. Your own wins. Your own screwups. Your own failures. Your life. Most people aren’t trapped by their job. They’re trapped by their tolerance for misery.\n\nFreedom isn’t given. You take it. You build it. You protect it.\n\nThe real failure isn’t the bad job or the clueless boss. **It’s thinking too small**. People dream in inches then wonder why their life feels tight. You don’t escape the rat race by getting a laptop. You escape it by raising your expectations for your own life. You set standards for yourself beyond what anything thinks is normal or rational.\n\nAnd here’s the part nobody teaches. Most people who leave corporate end up with a worse boss. The boss is *you*. And you’re brutal. You don’t trust yourself. You overthink. You worry about being judged. You micromanage your own ambition into dust. You make lousy money.\n\nPeople want to *play* entrepreneur, not *be* one. They want the aesthetic. Not the accountability. Real entrepreneurship is boring, lonely, and occasionally humiliating. It’s also the only path where your life becomes yours.\n\nMost people don’t fail because they lack talent. They fail because they never commit to being the one on the hook.\n\nAnd **finally**. My personal belief. There has NEVER been an easier time in history to earn six figures, even multi six figures, on your own. There may NEVER be a moment like this, ever again. The opportunities are everywhere. The tools are cheap. The playing field is wide open. The barrier to entry is ZERO.\n\nMost people still won’t do it. Not because it’s impossible. But because they don’t believe in themselves enough to try - and they set goals WAY TOO SMALL!",

Anyone in that environment would feel the same frustration you’re carrying.\n\nFreedom doesn’t feel like fireworks. It feels like space. Waking up without the tightness in your chest. Making decisions because they make sense, not because someone above you needs to posture. Being able to step back, breathe, and trust your own judgment. The biggest shift is simple. You stop feeling small. You stop feeling trapped in other people’s chaos and start building days that fit you instead of breaking you down.\n\nBut getting there is not a leap. It’s a slow build. You learn what kind of work you want. You test small ideas. You build something steady before you walk away from what pays your bills. The freedom comes from control, not escape. You don’t need motivation. You need direction and steps you can trust.\n\nI work as a franchise consultant, and I talk with a lot of people who reach the same breaking point you’re in.

Initially, I did feel exhilarated and like I was tasting the freedom that I think you're longing for. But it didn't take long for me to realize that I was ignorant about a lot of things and deluding myself into thinking that I had all the answers. I was the clueless one.\n\nMy life is great now, but there were several points along the way where I found myself wondering what life would have been like if a more humble me in the past would have asked different questions and looked more skeptically at the grass on both sides of the fence before jumping. Personally, I also needed a lot more therapy and maturity. Starting my own company nearly cost me my marriage and even my life.\n\nI hope you find the next step in your journey soon and that it's a peaceful transition. I don't think that it should have to be an either/or situation, Corporate vs freelance/small business owner. I think you can work in corporate America and still be happy.

I have automated everything from ticket creation, invoice sending, subscription and project  management to billing and forms inside erpnext.\n\nAs a founder myself, I don't wanna mess up with multiple tools or repeated works so I spent some of my initial time developing modules and customizing erpnext to match my workflow. Now i just have to create services for client (takes no longer than two minute), and everything from payments to subscriptions is done by logic.\n\nI happily spend $280 a month on s3 storage and cloud servers ($48 on erpnext server).

      "selftext": "It's a dumb question. You're not dumb, just maybe uninformed, which I will rectify shortly. But the question is very, very dumb.\n\nFirst off, people who ask \"what business should I start?\" are really asking \"how can I make a lot of money?\"\n\nStraight up, starting a business is a crappy way to make a lot of money. Statistically most people lose money. You're probably going to lose money. So, if you want to make a lot of money, get into management consulting or ibanking, which generally means getting an MBA. Have fun with that.\n\nSecondly, people who ask \"what business should I start?\" generally think that businesses are fungible, which means they're a commodity or easily swapped out with one another. This, btw, is why most businesses fail. Because people think that businesses are just this thing that you start and money comes out the other end.\n\nIf I said a great business is rolling up a bunch of dentist practices, would you know what to do with that? Like, do you have dentistry experience? Do you have PE experience rolling up companies? If the answer is no to both, don't fucking roll up a bunch of dentist practices. It requires skills you don't have.\n\nIf I said, \"ooh! ooh! ooh! AI, baby! AI is gonna change everything,\" are you especially good at AI? If you're not, then one school of thought would say that AI is a growing market, so you should learn AI and sell those services to other people. There's another school of thought that says every fucking person and their grandmother is learning AI right now so they can sell  services to other people and I really wonder what you are going to discover about AI that's going to make you better than my grandma.\n\nLastly, markets aren't interchangeable either.\n\nI spent nearly 30 years starting tech companies. Had a few successes and a bunch of failures. Now, I'm a world-class startup coach. I do that job exceptionally well, I have great word of mouth, make a lot of money. And when I started, I knew A LOT of people in several startup ecosystems. My access to that market helped me get off the ground and eventually scale this business.\n\nIf I decided to start a company selling shit to celebrities, I would fail. I would 100% fail. Why? I don't know any celebrities. I don't have access to that market and I'd probably run out of money and time before I figured out how to get celebrities' attention.\n\nStop asking what business you should start. They aren't lego bricks.\n\nHere's a much better question to ask yourself: what do I love to do?\n\nFind something you love to do. Get good at it. Prove that you're good at it by selling your services to other people, either as an employee or a contractor. Get promoted and get a great title. Or become a consultant, which is just a contractor who charges a shit ton of money.\n\nGet so good at what you love that you know things about your job and market that no one else knows about. Understand secrets about your industry that give you a fundamentally unfair advantage over everyone else. Even my grandmother.\n\nThen go start a business using that knowledge. That's the business you should start.\n\nEDIT: random spelling and grammatical errors. I type for shit.",

          "body": "I disagree. \n\nYou are speaking from the perspective of someone who has been in business for decades, but most of the people who ask these questions have never built their own thing. They might have fantasized about it, but they are either still in school or are shackled by a 9 to 5.\n\n  \nStarting a business is really hard. It is scary, risky, and almost everyone you know with a 9 to 5 will deride you for the decision.\n\nAnd one of the ways to make the journey easier is to build a community around you where you feel supported and advised.\n\nSo, when I see someone ask, \"What should I start?\", I am seeing someone who is scared to take the plunge and is trying to dip their toe. I see someone who is trying to diffuse their risk by asking for advice from more seasoned individuals.\n\nThat said, my main gripes are:\n\n1. I don't mind you asking, but I do mind you failing to execute on it. At the end of the day, you just have to take the leap, especially if you are still starting out. \n\n2. It is okay to ask for advice, but at the end of the day, you have to make up your own mind, and if you fail, you can't blame anyone else but yourself. In other words, don't start a business because others told you to, start it because you believe in it.\n\n3. Building a business is a marathon, not a sprint. There are no shortcuts, no viral hacks, and no expert tactics to help you leapfrog the competition. You need to put in a ton of elbow grease and understand that the best quality you can have is grit.\n\nSo, my perspective is ask for advice but then do something about it.",

I know comparing is the thief of joy but I see all these people my age making more money then I would know what to do with but I’m at a loss to how they do it. I’ve researched all these gurus business models like ecom, day trading, high ticket sales, etc. Some of them seem doable like learning to run ads for people or using AI to help automate things for companies that don’t have it or ecom or real estate but I feel like a lot of these markets are over saturated. I sometimes feel like it might just be easier to go find a good job and try to work your way to the top. Thoughts? Ideas? Anything would be appreciated.\n\nEdit: I’ve read all of your comments and I really appreciate the criticism and advice hopefully next time I post on this sub I will be at where I want to be, Thank you all.",

I’m sure you have skills and expertise that people are willing to pay for or you wouldn’t have a job. Take one of those skills, create an avatar of people that would buy your service/expertise. Find 10 of those people, if they don’t buy what you’re selling move to the next skill until people start paying for it. Then you hire people that can do it for you. Then you find 1 person to manage those people. Make enough money to pay people a decent wage every 2 weeks, pay bills and if you are able to do that it’s just rinse and repeat. Success is just repetitive boring tasks once you have the few things I mentioned.",

What broke me out of it wasn't finding the \"perfect\" opportunity, it was realizing I was using research as an excuse to avoid starting anything real.\n\n\n\nHere's the thing about those markets being \"oversaturated\" - that's usually code for \"competitive but still profitable if you're actually good at it.\" I spent 2 years convincing myself everything was too crowded while sitting on my couch doing nothing. The people making real money aren't worried about saturation because they're focused on execution, not excuses.\n\n\n\nStart with something you can begin this week, not next month. Pick ONE thing from your list (I'd personally go with running ads since it's skill-based and businesses always need it) and commit to landing your first client within 30 days. Don't worry about scaling to 10k yet, worry about proving you can deliver results for one person. Most people never make it past the first client because they're too busy planning their empire instead of doing the boring work of getting good at something.\n\n\n\nThe corporate ladder isn't going anywhere if you need to fall back on it, but you'll never know what you're capable of if you keep researching instead of executing. Time moves whether you're building something or not.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.",

You’re just early enough to be seeing the highlight reels of people who’ve been grinding for years and mistaking that for everyone’s doing it but me. Trust me, most of those 10k/month people you see online either, already had skills, already had money, or they conveniently don’t show you the 18 months they made nothing.\n\nabout the everything feels saturated thing, you’re not wrong. A lot of these spaces are saturated because people jump in blindly, copy whatever a guru says, and expect money to fall out of the sky. That’s why most fail.\n\nI’ll tell you what I tell anyone I’ve worked with, online income isn’t hard because the business models are bad. It’s hard because people underestimate the skill part. You mentioned ads which is a perfect example. Ads used to be a cheat code. If you run ads before building trust, you’re basically burning money. People don’t buy because they saw your ad. They buy because they trust the person behind the ad.\n\nI’ve seen people throw 500- 2k into ads with zero return because the foundation wasn’t there. Same with ecom, with digital products and with high ticket offers.\n\nEvery single model requires, knowing how to build a brand, knowing how to market without being annoying, learning how to create demand, learning how to communicate value, consistency and actual patience\n\nNobody wants to talk about those parts because they’re not lavish\n\nAnd yes, start while you’re still working. Anyone telling you to quit your job and go all in is setting you up to panicbuild instead of grow. Your job buys you time, reduces pressure, and lets you actually learn instead of chasing quick wins.\n\nIf I were starting at 20 again, I’d pick one model that actually aligns with my strengths, get the right education around it (whether through paid programs or months of deep research), and treat the first 6 months as skill building not income chasing. Real money comes once you stop trying to get rich fast and actually learn how the machine works.\n\nIf you want to talk specifics or narrow down what fits you, I don’t mind helping, been in the space a while and I’ve seen what actually works versus what just looks good on social media",

But I know what you mean you just have to get accustomed to the idea that you can’t build a business over night. I think that’s what I struggled with the most and I want to get everything done today or when I get off from work and it just can’t get done especially if you also prioritize going to the gym and have a day for cleaning and meal prepping. But what I can say starting was probably the second hardest thing and laying down the foundations. But like many in the sub and everywhere you will read and watch business is about testing and speed. If you get an idea just take action and test if it works and makes you some money. Yeah you have to give it time to see if it works but the steps for every model for the online space are almost the same. Not to be general and cliche the steps are get an idea, build a website or mvp with a waiting list or form, market your idea either social media organic or running ads to that website, and track absolutely everything. Scrolls, clicks, all the data you can gather collect it because later it will be useful. But yeah that’s the jist of things. I’m way farther than I was when I started and I got there by first doing one task a day and that turned into 3 tasks that o do daily. And then it just becomes autonomous",

Truth is most people don’t have the balls to do what you did and can be jealous. Dealing with this and knowing not to take it personal has been hard and can be discouraging but I know one day it’ll be worth it.

Tools and capital are the hardest part. I have 15 years of industrial in manufacturing and another 15 years of education and company planning. Building is the slow part. I'm not trying to corner any markets, I need minimal clientele. This will expand into dinner theatre and will eventually funnel into a tech company that works on immortality. I work on immortality. Crafting shares a lot with making the tools necessary for immortality. So capital and tools are often the most pressing issues, unless it is having a segment. Having a segment can be your only pressing issue. For example. If you are an influencer. You might not need many tools, but you need good ideas that pull in a segment. There are many different businesses which all make different demands.",

I planned well, but just felt silly explaining my decisions to people especially at the start when money wasn't coming in. But the best parts have been that I've done so many things I was once afraid of doing, cold emailing people, randomly messaging people to ask for advice from strangers, asking for more help, learning to see the bigger picture, understanding that money is in abundance even if it's not in abundance in my bank account yet, but I've learned better mindsets. I've gotten so many rejections that right now it almost doesn't phase me. I mean it hurts but my mind is all about going all to keep exploring and experimenting and seeing what works and what won't work. Like I'm going beyond my limits. Not having enough money is also scary as hell! I've learned more about human psychology, marketing is more about showing than telling. You'll almost never be sure many times, but just go for it. I've read some incredible books that have also helped me out. One I am reading now is called Sprint by [Jake Knapp](https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb/collections/author-books-by-jake-knapp), another that I read was The E-Myth Revisited, why most small businesses fail and why others don't. Something like that. I began seeing revenue by my 2nd month in operation. It was slow but I learned to document what was working on Notion, parts of the work I disliked and what I could do better. Goodluck!",

In your head the idea is amazing and adds value but whether customers feel that way is something that can only be tested after you provided the service/release your product.\n\nWith that, you will have a lack of guaranteed income for a while and maybe ever if the product does not get traction.\n\nSo for me that’s the hardest part of accepting the risk and uncertainty and pushing ahead",

It opens your mind the the most important aspect of business which is get a customer and get them to pay. Nothing else matters if you have 0 sales. Once you witness the full process of sales it expands how you think about business systems. 2. Start something incredibly simple to get a grasp of all the functions. Sales , marketing, operations, finance, opening an LLC, accounting and tax. You get a taste of how all this stuff works. You can do it on the weekend. Like junk removal or auto detailing. Simple businesses you can start with $1000 or less to get experience. Then jump into a high leverage opportunity once you have clarity from action. Clarity comes from action not thinking or watching youtube videos. In my opinion the perfect simple service business for you to start would be test prep or tutoring. Lets say you were really good at preparing for test prep. Go tape 50 signs around campus saying, \"Test prep $40 off and guaranteed 20% improvement on test scores with 4 session minimum\".

Pick ONE problem you've personally experienced and wished had a better solution. Just one.\n\n3. Talk to 5 people who have that same problem. Ask what they currently do to solve it. That's it.

Used it to find B2B leads for my consulting work (mostly targeting German companies - dentists, lawyers, small businesses).\n\nThe problem? Half the emails bounced. Customer support basically said \"yeah that happens.\" I was paying $1,250/month for a 50% accuracy rate. Insane.\n\nSo in February I got fed up and spent a weekend learning Python. Built a scraper that:\n- Finds .de domains in my target niches\n- Extracts emails from their contact pages (Impressum in Germany - legally required contact info)\n- Validates them before I even send an email\n\nRan it last month on ~2,500 dental practice websites:\n- Got 4,800+ emails \n- Bounce rate when I sent: 4.7% (vs the 50% I was getting before)\n- Cost: $43 in API fees + $12 AWS hosting\n\nI'm not trying to sell anything here. Just wanted to share because if you're paying for lead databases and getting garbage results like I was, you might want to look into building your own.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone's curious about the technical side.\n",

Second, centralize a simple asset table with fields for owner, status, serial, issue date, and return date, and automate a nightly digest that flags missing or overdue devices. For tooling a lot of teams stitch together a ticketing tool like Jira Service Management or Zendesk with an inventory table in Airtable or a DB, and then use whatever BI layer your team already uses to run weekly audits.

Before you know it, these \"Suggestions\" his buddy was making would move our rankings from number 2 in the map pack generating 50-60 calls a month down into the top 5 where calls were still good but nowhere near the same, and you could feel there was no bottom/end to this until eventually he fired me when I refused some of the vital changes he wanted.\n\nI didn't take it to heart, aside from the friend stuff he was a good guy so we parted ways but I guess things continued to drop in ranking once I left. Now fast forward to a few months out and I guess he's convinced himself that I'm doing voodoo black hat magic against his business. Like I said interesting scenario but I can asssure you I'm not tampering or doing anything and it actually pisses me off a little that he would assume that, considering my only goal in the first place was to help him out and I even gave that little rat a discount when he first signed. I'm a little heated but what do you think the best way to tell him to F\\*\\*\\* off is without escalating this any further?",

Cease all informal contact.\n* **Demand Absolute Specificity:** Require a comprehensive and formal submission detailing their claims, including:\n   * A detailed, itemized list of all alleged grievances.\n   * A precise monetary value assigned to each alleged damage, supported by a thorough justification of how that value was calculated.\n   * A complete list of any and all potential witnesses, including their full contact information.\n   * Certified copies of any and all documentation they believe substantiates their claim.\n\n**The Strategy:** The endless requests for documentation and strict adherence to arbitrary procedures are designed to exhaust their energy and motivation. This isn't about winning an argument; it's about making the process so arduous that they give up.\n\n**Your Demeanor:** Your calm, composed, and detached tone is your greatest asset. It subconsciously de-escalates the situation. By refusing to engage in an emotional exchange, you control the entire dynamic of the interaction.\n\n**Advanced Tactics:** Invent your own internal \"policies\" for handling such disputes. For example: \"It is the policy of this respondent to require all financial claims to be substantiated by no fewer than two independent, certified appraisals.\"\n\nYou can also quote long, fabricated policy statements in your responses to further bog them down in procedural quicksand.

He was near coming to blows with me.\n\nI told him, brother, if someone sends you a shitty agreement that you think doesn't benefit you financially, kudos do you for figuring it out, move on with your life. Find someone who can help you with the right proposal. There's nothing about what I did that is a scam. \n\nI kid you not, 1 hour of this going back and forth. He's yelling outside my house. My toddlers are inside the house and my wife comes out to find out what the hell is going on.",

Start with how that content is edited and shot. There are slight differences between each platform, and bearing those differences in mind can help buoy your content.\n\n\\- Considering using ads. If organic content is crushing it for you, you can scale even faster with ads on the right platform\n\n\\- Collaborating with other content creators on the platform of choice.\n\nAll said, I admire the hustle. keep it up",

I’ve been lazy and have been coasting on my income from Amazon for a few years, but royalties and sales are dropping. \n\nI’m thinking of launching a Shopify store but not sure whether to target some niches or go wide. I’m familiar with Amazon’s ad platform and used to use Facebook ads a few years ago, trouble is, I really don’t like social media. I’m going to have to get over that. \n\nSo what would you recommend? Go wide and also upload to eBay, Etsy etc supporting it with some low burn ads. Or go niche and concentrate on driving site traffic with social media/Google ads. \n\nA pointer in the right direction would be helpful. I know how much time and money testing can consume. \n\nThanks in advance.",

You keep giving away that this is inflated or made up. \n\nClothing is one of the hardest categories to get traction in, especially with no brand, no audience, and no pre launch structure. \n\nOrganic reach does not move a cold product from zero to two hundred orders in forty eight hours unless you push a large volume of creatives across platforms and spend real money. I am talking five to twenty thousand on day one, not the fifty dollar boost you claimed.\n\nYour timeline, your numbers, and the margin claim do not match any known reality in apparel. Forty percent net margin on physical product after ads, shipping, and cost of goods is not a thing. Your process sounds like someone describing ecommerce from the outside.\n\nTry again.",

The problem is the process for getting it registered is so quiet complicated. \n\nIts basically under the table and i have no proof of income coming from it. Cause I sell products in fb marketplace or through friends and network. I have coding background aswell. And i want to try something new. Got fired yesterday but im going to be celebrating tonight for reaching $500k earnings from my gigs. Im the only one who knows this and i just want to share it with strangers here in reddit.\n\nI cant share it with family or friends cause I feel like its wrong, its going to change my life and attitude for the worse because of pressure of trying to maintain my successful image , but at the same time i want to share my success or to brag maybe? Reddit became kind off my therapy and therapist.\n\nToday is a good day. I enjoyed the ferry ride and the scenery. Im gonna be trading some motherboards for PSUs and SSDs and once i come back home, im gonna say sorry to my wife and come clean. Have a good day fellas! \n\n",

          "body": "Here's my take. I used to run a construction business but taught myself how to build software. I developed my own crm, some marketing software, built the website and self hosted everything off a server in my apartment. On the plus side my office overhead was like $20/month for all the software we used because I built it.\n\nI tossed around the idea of starting a software company but I'm hesitent. Here's my take:\n\n1. As a non technical founder, you don't have the depth of knowledge to understand if a specific software stack is actually profitable. Most \"tech bros\" actually jam together a bunch of services and put their logo on it and call it \"their software\" when in reality they are paying 6 other companies for access to THEIR software. Basically you \"own the brand\" but not the actual software.\n2. Profitability is in the stack and not necessarily what the software does. For example, my website + lead gen software cost me $3/month. If you use wix, or another website builder, you'd pay $25-$50/month for the same service I get for $3 because I built it myself. So, if you don't create a \"software moat\" it's likely you'll end up using multiple other vendors to build your \"stack\" and end up bleeding all the upside in monthly API fees. If you build an AI automated CRM (for example) but you plug into AWS and GPT for api calls and hosting, you'll rack up $1000s/month in \"fees\". If you host the CRM yourself and train a small AI model, you're overhead would be near 0.\n3. The market is flooded and I mean FLOODED, with software. Unless you are excelent at sales and marketing, you'll struggle to provide any real value that other, larger companies don't. And, software behavior is very entrenched, people don't switch tools if ever. For example, a CRM, getting a company to switch from Microsoft to my CRM would be a nightmare and then try integrating it with their other workflows...just a huge hassle.\n\nAnyway, I'm not saying you can't do it. But from my perspective unless the software is self contained and built and the \"moat\" is in the stack - ie, cheap to actually scale, it's not an easy business to get into. Alot of the software bros you'll see either developed some niche tool that happens to solve some deep industry specific issue, OR were given a bunch of money and are living on hype and debt.\n\nTLDR \n\n  \nSo, is it worth it? Idk maybe lol. You don't need to be technical to sell something, but being technical helps because you can cut costs.",

You have to be so extroverted you must make a Mr. Beast video look dull. \n\nYou may not possess these skills right now. You can learn them. \n\nStart learning how to produce viral content.

          "body": "1. Don’t start a business just to start a business. Entrepreneurship is 5x more work and 10x more stress than a job. It’s very over sexualized in today’s day and age. Remember the noise you hear will never be about the failures. For every win you see, there are 10,000 failures. Be positive you want it before you start.\n\n2. If you don’t know what kind of business you want to start with the 50k, I revisit my point above. You need to want it so bad to push through the “I can’t pay my bills next month” times that will inevitably come. In order to do that, you need to either love what you’re pursuing or at least thoroughly enjoy it enough to push through the hard. Cause there will be a lot of it. \n\n3. If you have 50k, 2-3k should be used to actually start the business + sheer hustle. The remaining 47k should be used to get you through making jack shit or being u profitable for X amount of time. Don’t overshoot too early, you likely won’t need half of the shit you’ll invest in before you actually get started. \n\n4. Most importantly, if you’re getting into business because you don’t want to work for someone else - be VERY careful about the business you choose, the way you set it up and how much overhead you take on. Cause what you’ll see happen without even noticing it happening is becoming an employee to your own business. Remember to OWN your business, don’t let it own you. \n\nHope this all helps! Learned through many failures, mistakes and heartbreaks of my own.",

First thing I did was throw out flexible schedules completely and built what I call \"decision-free days\" where I plan everything the night before and just follow the script. I use Sunsama to timebox every single task on my calendar so there's zero room for my brain to wander or overthink. For the motivation piece, I had to manufacture quick wins by breaking everything down into stupidly small tasks. Like instead of \"build landing page\" it became \"write headline, pick color scheme, add one section\" etc. I track everything obsessively in a daily scorecard because seeing those checkmarks gives me the dopamine hit I need to keep going. The momentum thing was huge for me too, so I created what I call \"restart rituals\" for when I inevitably fall off. Instead of trying to jump back into where I left off (which felt overwhelming), I'd do one tiny 15-minute task related to the project just to rebuild the connection. For delayed gratification I literally gamified everything with point systems and weekly rewards, sounds childish but it works. The paralysis thing still happens but I've learned to just start with the absolute smallest possible step, even if it's just opening the right browser tab. Sometimes that's all it takes to break through the freeze.\n\n\n\nThe key insight for me was accepting that my brain works differently and building systems around that instead of fighting it. Structure isn't a limitation, it's actually what gives you freedom to execute consistently. Once you have the right framework, you can channel that hyperfocus energy way more effectively.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.",

You deserve all the tools you can access, and no amount of coping strategies will nullify it. And work *with* your neurodivergent brain rather than against it.\n\nPeople with ADHD need constant novelty. We are low baseline dopamine/stimulation and have to constantly feed it. So know in advance that an exciting idea today that becomes a solved problem in a few years will not stick well, because you'll get bored and something else will catch your attention. You need to pick work that will keep giving you new puzzles, new concepts to learn.\n\nFor example, I coach business founders across many industries. Being industry-agnostic forces me to learn new things all the time and keeps the work stimulating. Too much repetition and the work gets too easy. When work is too easy for me, I get bored and want to start something new. Your brain probably grasps concepts and makes intuitive connections quickly. You're probably creative. So put yourself in a position that financially rewards intuitiveness and creativity.\n\nPick the right roles for your brain. Partner with people who complement you, like opposite strengths and weaknesses (and value alignment of course). Detail-oriented people who like creating structure. You can balance each other out - you give them fresh perspectives and inspire them with your creativity and passion for learning. Be cautious teaming up with other ADHDers lol, it can be like trying to walk 8 dogs at once and every dog wants to sniff a different patch of grass.\n\nSo find a purpose that can keep generating fresh challenges for you. Fall in love with a problem, rather than a solution. Solutions get stale once you understand them. Problems force you to keep learning.",

Every single “failure” and feeling of pain that you’ve experienced in the past is a seared lifelong lesson on your psyche that will have compounding positive effects into your next venture (but only if you let it and perceive it to be the case, optimism is and has always been an underrated skill to be mastered)\n\nNaval Ravikant has this idea of 10,000 iterations to mastery rather than “10,000 hours to mastery”. \n\nKeep modulating. \n\nEvery single small and large iteration you make to the business, your mindset, and your systems brings you closer to that 10,000 number.\n\nHere is also a hard truth: This version of yourself will have to die for you to upgrade into a  “higher version” of yourself that is capable of achieving all of the grandeur that you wish to achieve.

That’s why you can’t focus on a longer delayed gratification goal. You’re going into dopamine withdrawal and it’s robbing you of your will to continue.

The only thing that matters is getting the fix.\n\nThe good news is you can fix it. If you deprive your brain of the constant dopamine hits for a few weeks it will return to normal function. So how do you do that? It’s pretty simple really. Put down the phone and close all tabs on the browser that aren’t important. No reddit, no instagram etc. maybe reward yourself with 30 mins at the end of the day. But the rest of the day keep it away. That’s it. Do that and in a few weeks you’ll be free of it and can then focus on things that will make your life better.\n\nFuck the algorithms. They’re destroying us. Time to fight back.",

Can't work without a structure? Structure your work first. For example I'm a web app developer, and for me the structuring starts at the database level, if I know how database relations are going to work I have much easier time coding the app.\n\n2. Make a checklist. I prefer a pen and paper checklist because it makes me feel more responsible, also since it's not a browser tab or an app on my phone that I can \"forgot to open\", it just sits there on my desk and silently judges me. (Also I HIGHLY recommend watching this 40min video on YouTube called \"7C's to success by Brian Tracy\", that talk literally changed my life and every few months I go back and watch it again)\n\n3. Start small, but start. Even if you have the structure and checklist prepared, waking up and sitting down to work is usually the hardest part. For this exact purpose, I give myself \"snack tasks\". Which are some checklist items that are easy to do to start my day with a win, tasks that don't take longer than 5-10 minutes to complete. I'll say it again, for me at least, **starting** the work is way harder than continuing it.\n\nI also have those days where I work 10+ hours with full productivity, but those days -at least at the start- aren't too different than the days where I feel almost a physical pain just thinking about sitting down to start working. Having the checklist and starting small helps me get the ball rolling and after that I don't find it difficult at all to continue for hours, most of the time I don't even realize that I have been working for X hours.\n\nBonus tip : fix your sleep schedule if it's broken. It's way harder to motivate yourself to work if you woke up at 4pm compared to waking up at 8-10am. Not impossible, just harder.",

What finally broke the cycle for me was realizing that my brain literally needed different systems than what everyone else recommended. The \"hustle and grind\" advice made everything worse because it assumed I could just power through with willpower, but neurodivergent brains don't work that way. I had to build what I call \"external scaffolding\" - basically making my environment do the thinking so my brain didn't have to. Here's what actually worked: I started timeboxing everything the night before, putting every single task on my calendar with specific start and end times. No more to-do lists that I could ignore. I also created artificial deadlines and rewards every single day, not just for big milestones. Like literally rewarding myself for working 2 hours straight, not waiting months for revenue. I duplicated everything I needed in multiple rooms so there was zero friction to start working. Most importantly, I tracked a daily scorecard of just 3-4 things so I could see progress even when the business metrics weren't moving yet. The key was accepting that I needed more structure than neurotypical entrepreneurs, not less.\n\n\n\nOnce you stop fighting your brain and start designing around it, everything changes.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.",

There's nothing wrong about that.\n\nAlso when it comes to savings, you never know how people have mentally allocated their money. Maybe that's \"the kids' inheritance\" in her mind, or \"just in case\" money, or maybe she's already earmarked it for something expensive that she hasn't paid for yet. You have no idea, so don't make assumptions.\n\nFinally, as a rule: don't discount your services unless that's part of your business model. Instead, if someone needs to spend less, figure out what you can offer that is inside their budget. If you're normally $100 and she only has $75, figure out what you can offer (profitably) at $75. It's more fair and avoids these kinds of conflicts.\n\nDo the work because you agreed to and you're a person of your word. If you *truly* feel deceived, just decline future work from this person.",

Entitled, living off the state, they absolutely NEED what you're selling, but they also NEED it to be cheaper.\n\nThen there's the scum who can easily afford everything they ask for, but think it's 'entrepreneurial' or clever to get the cheapest price possible, through any means.\n\nSo, don't give discounts. You'll know when a client really could do with it, and you can make that gesture when you're sure. If they ask for it - outside of fundraisers and such anyway - you can be fairly certain they're taking the piss, either out of you, or 'the system'.\n\nAgain - wild generalisation, but from personal experience, very true.",

I wrote him emails, outlined my concerns that those clients didn't need us as bad as we needed them, that their balances were too high, that we couldn't swing those kind of outstanding balances. Every month was a struggle to make payroll but he wanted to believe and wanted other people to believe that money wasn't a big deal. \n\nAnyways fast forward, all those people stiffed him. His accounts receivable was nearly $400k when I quit. All the people who I said were going to walk out on their bills did. He is an attorney, and even tried taking one of those clients to court, and so far it has backfired spectacularly. \n\nMoral of the story is you don't work for free. The minute someone stops paying is the minute the work stops. None of those clients are your friends. You do work for them, and they pay you.",

So the cost wasn’t just the commission on the return but also the commission on another whole day of sales as well. \n\nThe quicker they can put it behind them, the quicker they can go back to making money.\n\nI feel like you are in the same spot. Not only could you lose $162k, but you could lose a whole lot more losing your focus for a lost cause.  Stay focused on your business. And one of the focus points should be establishing credit guidelines for clients including limits, and credit holds that take effect way sooner.

He was an M&amp;A broker and claimed breach of contract for $1m in damages on a $20m sale. \n\nHe cleverly requested a jury trial instead of a judge trial since thats the plaintiffs right too choose.\n\nHis whole case was based on a verbal contract even though all he ever did was exchange about 8 emails with the owners and sat in on one meeting. The jury ultimately decided this was enough to establish a verbal contract and voted unanimously after 10 minutes of deliberation to award him $1m -- I shit you not.\n\nVerbal contracts do hold up in court. I would assume you have emails and history to prove the same? I would advise consulting with a different attorney that knows contract law -- ideally on contingency if you feel like you have a strong enough paper trail.\n\nGood luck and dont give up just yet!",

One part time staff has asked if we plan to provide healthcare benefits (plus vision and dental) at some point. She has a daytime / full time job where she is getting benefits currently and said she would like to come over full time if we can provide benefits. She says that her current employer \"takes care of everything\" and that she does not pay any contribution to the plan. So I said I will look into it. For her plus her spouse and child, the total monthly premium on a mid-level package is about $2,200 per month if I did 100% employer contribution. For context she is support staff making $29 / hr.\n\nFor me it's too much of a stretch to justify at $26K annual benefits package for someone whose base is roughly $60K / yr. I could change the contribution rate to say 50/50, but then I'm not competitive with her current FT employer and I think the premium split at 50% would be prohibitive for her and her family anyway.\n\nSo the question is: how do small businesses do this? I know there are a lot of options out there, but for those of you that have been down this road, what did you learn along the way? What was the best option that you settled on? I'd really like to offer competitive comp packages, but health benefits seem especially difficult.\n\nThanks!",

We shop out our plan and our broker sends us dozens of options, so I know we're looking at the best rates out there; but I'm seeing annual 10-20% increases with decreasing benefit richness the past 5 years. That isn't sustainable, especially when I'm trying to keep pace with wages as well.

          "body": "So after 1/1 health insurance as most people understand it will be largely unsustainable for most people.  Businesses,  unless they are a large group which can self fund their plan may have a chance if they really care out their PBM/specialty drugs. Not only that - but the value from healthcare today just isn’t there. It’s darn near impossible to get a primary care md, appt, much less specialty care. There are options to consider like direct primary care - and concierge medicine where people actually get to see a doctor on a regular basis.  At least there’s some continuity of care. Put it together with a major medical for catastrophic- and you may actually be able to get back to what it was before the ACA fully rolls back. Leverage a CannaRx for specialty meds.   What most people don’t quite understand is that insurance rates are based on a pooled population. The larger the pool, the lower rate for everybody whether you’re buying from the exchanges or whether you’re buying a private plan from a carrier.  Doesn’t matter. So what’s happening now is you’re getting a smaller pool. The people left in the pool pay more. =ALL insured people will pay more. There is no replacement for “Obamacare”  and it’s pretty clear the “concepts of a plan” is nothing.  So what’s the solution? Either talk to a broker about self- funding- to be safe you should have about $250k to even have that discussion. The other option is a voucher - not sure how fast that’s all getting repealed. You should talk to a small market broker. As a small employer- things are just getting more difficult (tariffs - direct and indirect impact), labor crunch-immigration, and this is one more measure to make it harder to retain good talent. I’m sorry. I had 3 locations and just shuttered 2 because of all of the above. Last year I saw the writing on the wall and re-og’d. We had to get nimble, reorganize and leverage tech instead, which is what we were trying to avoid at all costs. Not good but it was better than losing everything. We’ll expand again in the future when things stabilize.",

My former business partner hired a woman and she wanted no health insurance premium deducted from her paycheck. He just docked the amount she was going to receive from the amount of her premium. Employers of big companies get a break on costs, but not huge ones, so unless she’s coming from a government job, or a huge multinational, her take home is probably lessened by her employer covering the total cost.\n\nWhat I would do is, tell her that your cost to insure her is $2200/mo, you can have it so she pays 0, but it will be reflected in her hourly pay at take home. Sometimes I don’t think employees look at total compensation, paid vacation, sick and health benefits all cost money, so when we pay those out, it’s part of their total pay package. Some just look at the hourly rate and base it on that, which is unfair if you provide other benefits.",

      "selftext": "This is based in Ontario, Canada 🇨🇦 \n\nI am not mentioning names because I do not want legal issues, but I need to get this off my chest.\n\nA while ago I started providing cleaning services for a couple who owned an Airbnb. The husband acted like a big entrepreneur and constantly talked up his plans. His wife was an influencer with millions of followers. I barely ever spoke to her and she never communicated with me, but he kept bringing her up as if her follower count meant their business was legitimate.\n\nHis business partner was a realtor and the two of them acted like they were on the verge of building a large real estate empire. They told me they were buying 13 properties in Orlando and said I would get all the cleaning contracts. I run a cleaning agency and handle hiring, interviews, scheduling and operations, but I still let their hype get to me.\n\nLooking back, it is embarrassing how much I believed them.\n\nThey pushed me to lower my prices and told me I would make more long term because of the volume they would bring. Lower rates meant cleaners made less money and did not want to work their job, which caused constant staffing issues. They did not care. They just wanted cheaper labor.\n\nThey nitpicked everything. Small towel marks, tiny smudges, anything they could point to. One time four towels were slightly dirty. Instead of washing them, he ordered more than two hundred dollars worth of towels and cloths without asking and then made me pay him back for the order. He acted like he was helping me by explaining how to claim the HST.\n\nHe often acted friendly and gave me advice as if he was mentoring me, then switched into being demanding and controlling. The most insulting thing he said was, “You should not run a cleaning business if you are not a cleaner.” I run a real agency. I am educated and I manage the business. I do not need to personally scrub toilets to operate a company. His comment showed he did not respect what I built.\n\nSomething important is that during this time I kept asking him about Orlando. I told him I was planning to open a branch there. I told him I was hiring people. He knew I was taking the opportunity seriously and believed what he said. Despite that he kept lying about the 13 houses and the future work. He watched me prepare for something that did not exist.\n\nEventually my only Hamilton cleaner quit and after more than thirty hours of interviewing and reviewing applications I realized the entire situation was a dead end. Their budget did not match their expectations and every cleaner disliked going there. The promises were never real.\n\nI finally sent a formal message ending the relationship and telling them I would no longer be providing cleaning services. They never replied. No thank you. No acknowledgment. Nothing.\n\nThat silence told me everything.\n\nHere is the interesting part. Because of their constant talk about Orlando, I actually opened a branch there. I hired people and started operating. And somehow it worked. I am now running my agency in Orlando and so far it has been more successful than what I had in Hamilton. I never would have considered Orlando if it was not for their story, even though their own plans were fake.\n\nSo in a strange way, something good did come out of this. I just had to learn the hard way that not everyone who talks big is telling the truth.\n\nHere is what I learned:\n\nPeople connected to influencers are not automatically professional or honest.\nPeople who promise future opportunities often want discounts today.\nFriendly behavior does not mean respect.\nAnyone who tries to devalue your work is not a partner and never will be.\nSometimes walking away is the best business decision you can make.\n\n\n\n\nForgot to add:\n\nThe biggest red flag I ignored was the fact that they dropped their long time cleaner for my company. No warning to her, nothing. They just kicked her out to start using me. She was really good to them from what I heard &amp; only had a minor scheduling issue. Also, the main guy I was dealing with lied to me that “guests are refusing to pay the higher cleaning fee” when he never updated the cleaning fee on Airbnb from $120 to $200 (which is what I charged him). I know this because I checked the listing every day for new reviews. So that was also a ploy to get me to lower the cleaning fee… I’m probably forgetting some things.",

You should also know that most new airbnbs are not profitable and many loosing money. Thats why may are for Sale. The one biggest expense they face is the cleaning fee….so it’s not surprising they try  to decrease that.

The one non negotiable skill is adaptability in your decision making - changing direction quickly when the data and market punch you in the face.​\n\nResilience without adaptability just means you keep bravely driving into the same wall, and pure execution without adaptability turns into mindless grinding on a bad plan.​\n\nThe businesses that survive are the ones whose owners notice what reality is telling them and pivot products, pricing, marketing or operations faster than everyone else.​\n\nResearch on small business success keeps coming back to flexible management, willingness to experiment and adjust, and strong general management capacity, which are all functions of adaptable thinking.​\n\nSeen this pattern in the wild more times than I care to count - the stubborn genius with a “perfect” idea loses to the boring owner who keeps iterating.​\n\nHow do you build adaptability as a skill?​\n\nShorten your feedback loops: talk to customers weekly, track a few simple metrics, and decide every month what you will stop doing, not just what you will add.​\n\nGet comfortable testing small bets instead of going all in, so changing course feels like normal operations, not a personal failure.​\n\nFinally, learn just enough basic finance to see in black and white which experiments are actually paying for themselves, then double down or kill them quickly.​\n\nIf you consistently notice what is working, admit what is not, and adjust faster than your competitors, you can be mediocre at almost every other “entrepreneur skill” and still win.",

Even basic bookkeeping tools can flag things for you so you just approve instead of digging.  \n• Do a quick ten minute cleanup once a week instead of a full audit at tax time. Way easier on the brain.  \n• Keep a tiny buffer in your business account for unexpected charges so you’re not tempted to swipe the personal card just to get something done.\n\nWhen the financial side runs a little smoother and you’re not juggling every small purchase, the whole separation thing feels way less stressful. It frees up headspace for the bigger decisions too, especially when you’re planning out cash flow for growth.",

People gave me that advice years ago and I wish I'd listened to them.\n\nIf you are a sole proprietor or a single-member LLC disregarded (and thus a sole prop. for tax purposes), though, it's a moot point since you can't payroll yourself, and you have to pay self-employment tax on everything anyway.\n\nIf you open an S (or C) corp, you can payroll yourself, and then excess money left over counts as dividends (called \"retained earnings\", and the rules for S corps are that all the retained earnings left over gets reported as dividends). Alternatively you could pay yourself a bonus on your payroll at the end of the year. A competent CPA/accountant will tell you which you should do and how much.\n\nOne of the benefits to being on payroll is that if your business tanks and you shut down... you've paid into unemployment and can legitimately go on unemployment, or (another likely scenario) you get another job somewhere else, get laid off in a few months, and then you're still eligible for unemployment. And the other is workers' comp - if you get injured on the job, you'll be covered - this is far more valuable than a lot of people think it is. Regular health insurance will be a nightmare to get your injuries paid for once they find out you were injured on the job.\n\nQualifying for a mortgage or loan becomes easier too when you can just show them a normal W-2 and paystub.",

There is one major player in our area that has bought up a bunch of smaller companies over the years, but they don't have a great reputation with customer service oddly enough. However they are branded well, have multiple officers and warehouses all over the area, you can't even hit a stop light without looking up with one of their vehicles. \n\nI've been tasked to help a company who is taking a slightly different approach to these contracts grow their business but of course that means going after monopoly contracts. These deals are multi-year so when you miss them it could be another 3-5 before you get a chance to bid again. A lot of them also have RFPs, so you can spend a week with a team combing through the details and building a very thought through proposal. \n\nIn the last 4 months, we have been told that we've won 9 contracts that would have been taken from this competitor, however, in every single instance, they had the option in their existing contract to price match and ultimately got to keep it themselves. All the time and effort we put in it just so the big guy can say yeah we'll do that is tiring. \n\nHow can you possibly get past this? \n\nIt's almost all about the money by the way. Corporations, hotel chains, HOA boards are the ones making these decisions. If they can squeak out more money for the deal that's all that matters to them unless someone royally screws up. The little things like we provide better customer service, we're technology focused, increase customer spending etc are all looked at as salesman fluff. \n\nAlso you don't get to meet with the decision makers very easily. Going after a Hilton hotel, the local GM has little say. Going after a neighborhood, there are a dozen people on the HOA board and you may have only spoken to one of them.\n\nWhat can be done here?",

Faster response times, better staff who are treated and paid better so are nicer to the customers etc. Whatever it takes.\n\nThis isn't foolproof though - if the customer has a checklist of requirements, then it's easy for them to overlook the nuances of the quality of those things, especially if they're procuring from head office, where checklists and price are all they're really going to look at....so you really need to go deep on how you are more than just A N Other supplier, so deep in fact that it becomes obvious that the BEST monopoly supplier can do is not even acceptable in your world.\n\nAlternatively, you can play the longer game. Note, I've seen this play out myself, but in the software world rather than services. The principle is the same, however.\n\nYou know when contracts are due up, so instead of waiting for the RFP to be issued, spend 12-18 months running up to it effectively demonstrating how your service is better. Attend relevant conferences and trade shows. Figure out a new process, give it a funky name. Make sure that by the time the RFP is being put together, your approach is already on their lips. Make it so those going shopping are already thinking about what you offer, and then be the ones to actually offer it.\n\nBasically, spend some time in the run up to contract renewals seeding potential clients with you, your approach, and how it's the right choice. The more subliminal / indirect, the better. If you can leave them wanting something and not even knowing who provides it until your proposal ticks every box, then you've done it perfectly.\n\nMake this large company compete with you, rather than the other way around.",

Once switched, it was very clear it was a \"jack of all trades\" situation. While their platform did much more, everything it did was worse, including the payroll functionality.   \n  \nI switched back to Gusto and vowed never to do that again. My records are still all separated for that reporting period. I like how Gusto has gradually added feature after feature slowly over the years after they've been fully vetted and tested.

          "body": "Let me cut and paste my experience with Rippling below.\n\nRippling also engages in a sales-oriented process where you have a person to talk to when you're buying but absolutely nobody to contact once the sale is up. Everything is via a \"ticket\" which isn't very helpful when a state agency says there's something wrong with payroll.\n\nThey also cost more than my local CPA's payroll service does.\n\n&gt;I'll go ahead and take some heat. Rippling is an absolutely awful horseshit payroll agency.\n\n&gt;They refused to comply with the laws for workers' comp in my state, insisting that some third-party they use would \"provide my workers' compensation\" (my state has a state-run monopoly on workers' comp). This third-party (and Rippling) failed to open a Workers Comp account, had no place for me to enter my own Workers Comp account number, and never filed any reports with the state, besides saying they did. They also said \"sorry too bad you are locked into a 18 month contract with us and you can't leave and will have to keep paying\" - for a payroll service I COULD NOT USE.\n\n&gt;I consulted with a CPA and an LLM (a type of lawyer who specialises in taxes, nothing to do with AI), and the state Workers Comp themselves. All of them said Rippling was full of shit. But some good news:\n\n&gt;State Workers Comp said they had so many other small employers who had run into this problem - apparently with the third party who actually runs Rippling's payroll, Rippilng doesn't even run their own technology, they hire it out - who mess up state Workers Comp that they would waive all penalties and fees and helped me prepare my Workers Comp reports to get caught up.\n\n&gt;I finally informed Rippling that a qualified CPA, an actual lawyer, and the state itself all said Rippling were wrong. Their response? \"We will be happy to offboard you and refund all charges.\"\n\n&gt;Get a real payroll company like ADP who actually knows how to do payroll. Or just go with your local CPA! Most of them can do it and you will have a REAL person you can call and talk to you when something goes wrong.",

You are the owner. \n\nOwnership and responsibility is apart of the equation. You can’t own up to your faults if you don’t know them.\n\nDon’t take it so harshly because you still made a good deal of money. Whatever you did in the beginning worked! Keep your head up and increase your network, once the network increases, your net worth increases.\n\nIt’s a shame, you do 3.5 million in sales and I don’t even know what your business is. Please contact our group let us know what you do and we can HELP you and give you our coins if we only knew what your business is.\n\nLet’s network together!",

I got thru this before and I can get thru this now.” \n\nTrust me, I get it. I’m going thru a very similar thing right now in my business. I’m in digital marketing and Google has completely screwed up my business model. I’ve been depressed about it for about 2 years now. Shit ton of work with very little profit to show for despite a lot of cash flow and 21 employees. Complete madness. I always thought I can turn it around.

One of those is your expectations and metrics for success. Being her first market, not only are you new to buyers, but you're also new to other sellers, and likely also new to *selling* directly to people. There is so much that will passively go into this (\"Do I look nice?\" \"Does my products look nice?\" \"Man I must look like an idiot to all these other vendors\" etc etc). My metric for my first market was \"hand out 5 business cards and have one detailed conversation about the craft\" (I do custom game consoles if you're curious). I didn't sell anything at this market, but I didn't consider it a failure because I accomplished:\n\n* Learning how to set up at a market\n* Learning how to break down after a market\n* Practicing my pitch\n* Hearing different questions/comments people had and considering how I could better address that\n* Meeting some of the other vendors in my local market scene\n* Doing something new to me, which while not necessarily directly impacting my business, does help with leading a personally fulfilling life. It gets pretty boring to just to the same 5 things over and over, at least to me :)\n* Met my two pre-set metrics above! \n* Getting your name out there; if this is a recurring show and you go often enough you *will* get people to start recognizing you\n\nShe may or may not value the exact things I listed here, but I can pretty much guarantee that if she sits down and thinks about it she would be able to come up at least 2 positive things about the market, especially as a first go at it. One of the best things about having a partner is that they can help you see things you may be blind to because you're caught up worrying about one specific thing (like if you're the biggest idiot on the planet for thinking someone would be stupid enough to buy something you made), so you can thank my wife for helping me to see the positives of my first market where I sold nothing despite stressing for a month I didn't have enough inventory to even show up, lol. \n\nHope this helps, and glad to see you're trying to help each other out.\n\nAs a final note, I definitely suggest looking for juried markets. It will help to cut down on AI/MLM stuff, which no one actually likes to see which will hurt attendance for the show. I find if shows accept things like this they are more concerned with their booth fees vs putting on a good show for the vendors/attendees. If it is an option I suggest attending markets at the location and see what the vibe is like!",

Most don’t have time for that.\n\nWhat I do is pretty straightforward:  \nI find places online where people are already asking for help with the exact problem your business solves, and I help you get in front of them. It turns into warm conversations instead of cold outreach.\n\nNo ads, no daily posting, no complicated funnels.\n\nIf you want more customers and you’re not sure where to start, tell me what industry you’re in.

I work a lot of extra hours from home but it's important for me to be present in my office during our typical work day. I had a boss in the past that was never around and it caused poor morale and lots of animosity on our team, so I vowed to always be present and a team player in my own practice.\n\nI dress as if I was in a hospital outpatient clinic, wearing work pants and blouses, but always paired with fun earrings and colorful vans or flats. As a medical professional I do feel it is important to present as a \"professional\", but I like to show that I still have personality, and I push boundaries more in my own practice with style than I could have when I worked in a hospital. \n\nWe have a business line for our patients to call, but I never give them my personal cell. A handful of them I see for home health and they have my Google Voice number so that they can reach out to me if something comes up and they need to cancel.\n\nI think a lot of these answers depend on your field. Medical professionals in private practice will likely give you different answers from founders of a startup brewery or graphic designers that can work remotely.

Some clients are offended if you are all business, some are offended if you aren't. General rule of thumb is to let them set the tone of the relationship within reason, and to know how to switch back to business mode when appropriate. \n\n(Some clients try to use personal relations to get freebees.

          "body": "Time: I’m available from 9-5, m-f, but I make a list of what I need to accomplish the next day, every day.  Sometimes that turns into 12 hour work days, sometimes it’s two hours in the afternoon and I can relax the rest of the day.\n \nDress: Any face to face with clients or B2B is collared shirt and slacks up to a suit, depending on situation.  If it’s phone calls all day, I’m in PJ’s.\n\nCleanliness: How clean my workspace is, is directly tied to my productivity and how in compliance I am with security measures required by my clients.  The beginning of my work day and end of my work day have 5-10 minutes of cleaning my office.  It is not inaccurate, but everything has a specific place and needs to go there.\n\nPackaging: Clients pay for packaging and shipping.  I have organized labels and folders for clients in a cabinet and purchase the shipping box/label at my local Fed/ex.\n\n\n Work Gear:Bar code inventories with depreciating asset spreadsheet for all big ticket items (computers/printers/badges).  Small things (pens, notepads, whiteout) are written off, but purchasing is tracked, capped, and must be authorized if monthly cost goes above allocated.\n\nPhone: I do not have a work phone, however I really only deal with B2B. I do not get customers calling me for quotes or general questions.  With my business, it’s understood that all that stuff will be discussed during an actual set meeting.  Almost all tedious correspondence is conducted via email, which I only use on my work computer for security purposes.\n\nOverall, If I am working with others, I tend to try and be incredibly professional, however that’s the nature of my business (Government Contracts).  If I am on my own, I’m taking breaks with my dog, watching tv in the background, doing choirs or a playing a few rounds of a video game for a break. I am also wearing PJ’s the whole time.",

Has been tough and many circumstances make it far more difficult than it should be. But as for professional, I am not!!\n\nI likely have ADHD so will start and not finish tasks etc. \n\n* Do you have a start &amp; end time you stick to? No. Kids mean I am in the office anywhere from 830-1030am and finish anywhere from 230pm to midnight depending on school drop off and pick ups and if we have lots of work on that needs to be finished before the next day!\n* How do you dress for calls, when meeting clients? Don't do vid calls. I dress in shorts and t shirts in the summer. Jeans and a casual lumber jack style shirt or jumper in the colder months. Most of my meetings are face to face so that I can physically show client's our products etc. I will wear chinos and a nicer shirt and office shoes or boots for those. \n* How clean do you have your workspace and desk? My desk is a mess 90% of the time, not helped by the antiquated paper based production system we have! \n* If you have a physical / digital product you sell, how do you handle your packaging and wrapping? Physical 90% B2B branded merch in the hundreds per order usually. Bulk packed in cardboard boxes of 10-60pcs per box. \n* What about company branded gear/work wear? We make the branded stationery. Branded shirts etc.\n* Do you use different phones to not mix clients for work and personal? Office phone connected to an app. Couple of clients whatsapp on personal number.",

This may or may not work for you.\n\nI have worked from home in both company roles and entrepreneurial roles and the thing that has made the biggest difference for me is structure. I do my best work when I have a defined start and end time (when possible - of course OT is needed at times). When the day feels open ended I lose focus fast. When I give myself a real beginning and a real wrap up I stay sharper and I feel like I actually put in a proper day.\n\nI also need a real workstation. A desk that stays relatively clean. A chair that feels like it belongs in a workplace. I dress comfortably for most of my day because that is part of the perk of working for yourself, and I will level it up for client calls because it shifts my mindset and it signals respect.\n\nThe little things matter too. I try to keep my space tidy because my environment affects my energy. I keep my digital world clean as well which means naming files properly and organizing folders so I am not hunting for things. \n\nI only use one phone but I keep strong boundaries on notifications and work hours so things do not bleed together. For me professionalism at home is not about pretending I am in a corporate office. It is about choosing habits that support the kind of work I want to do and the way I want clients to experience me.",
