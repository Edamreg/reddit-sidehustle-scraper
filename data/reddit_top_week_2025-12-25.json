      "selftext": "idk if this is just me but why do clients suddenly develop amnesia the moment money is involved 😭  \nhad this guy hit me up all confident like “yeah bro let’s do it, timeline is tight but budget is ready” (red flag #1 I ignored bc rent)  \nI do the work, send previews, he’s hyped. like FULL CAPS hyped. “THIS IS PERFECT 🔥🔥”  \ncool. I send invoice.  \nabsolute silence. man vanished like I summoned him with a spell that expired.\n\nI follow up after 2 days. nothing. a week later he replies “sorry bro got busy, will sort tomorrow”  \ntomorrow has now been 11 tomorrows. I see him posting stories. I see him active on LinkedIn. I see him commenting on other people’s posts like life is amazing. but my invoice? dead. cold. probably in witness protection.\n\nthe worst part is you start questioning yourself like did I mess up? was it not that good? should I have said something different? but nah… this happens WAY too often to be a coincidence. some people just like the idea of hiring freelancers, not actually paying them.\n\nanyway lesson learned (again): hype doesn’t pay bills, screenshots of “looks great” mean nothing, and if someone says “I’ll pay tomorrow” without a date… just mentally move on and don’t pause your life waiting. back to work I guess 🥲\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nPeaceeee!!!!!!!",

So I'll give you an example of what I do to make at least $300-500 a month, it's really random and not consistent but works for me.\n\nI use a bunch of survey and play to earn apps during downtime like commute or before bed. That gets me around $80-120 most months. I mainly use Swagbucks and Babki which has both surveys and games so I can switch when one gets boring. Also throw in some other random ones when I see signup bonuses.\n\nThen I do small freelance gigs on Fiverr for excel work mostly data entry or reorgnaization. Some months I get 2-3 gigs and make $200, other months nothing. It's inconsistent but when combined with the apps it usually lands somewhere in that $300-500 range.",

Annual performance and salary reviews is sales opportunity.\n\n3. If you ever wanted to build something for yourself, sales is the first skill you will need. Want to start a marketing agency?

Obviously it fluctuates but on average I'd probably make $100-500 a week and spent maybe 10-60mins total per week (sourcing stuff, posting it and meeting people)\n\n\nMy process:\n\n\nUse warehousewatcher.com to find Amazon warehouse deals, alot of that stuff is 40% off + and is in like new condition. If you can't find a buyer you can always return it too.\n\n\nAlso if you go directly on amazon.com enter \"warehouse deals\" in the search field, this also lets you look through their warehouse items, however they've made it increasingly hard to see what's actually in stock without clicking on the item first. Another excellent way to source product is if you're lucky enough to have online auctions with local pickup near you. You'd be surprised how cheap you can get things simply because you don't have competition.",

They want a lease agreement in my business name and utility bill showing the business address. Problem is I run everything from home right now and all my utilities are obviously in my personal name not my LLC. My accountant said mixing personal and business addresses can be a headache for taxes too. I reached out to amazon seller support and they basically said without proper business documentation the verification could get rejected. Same thing with tiktok shop, their KYC process is apparently pretty strict about having legit commercial presence. I'm doing about $15k/month right now but want to expand to these bigger platforms. Don't really have the budget or need for actual office space, just need the documentation to pass their verification process.I really dont wanna get my account suspended later because of this since this is my side hustle i let it go to this point.",

The most i made was 200$ for 4 hours of work, but i removed multiple 8 foot tall bushes, loaded them in my truck and did dump runs. (+ clean their yard up after)\n\nOh, I also have a truck (required lol)\n\nAll this took was creating a name, a quick description of the work I am capable of completing, and some trusting members of my community.\n\nNow, I need a business license and insurance. Ive opted for just telling people I am not a registered business and I dont have insurance, and most people are happy just to have someone there to help.\n\nSo there it is.

You can learn the basics in a few weeks and start freelancing. Ive been doing email marketing for 11 years and its still one of the most in demand skills out there. All you need is a laptop\r\n\r\nFreelance writing – if you can write decent theres always work. Blogs, articles, website copy. Sites like upwork are competitive but once you get a few reviews it picks up\r\n\r\nBasic bookkeeping – if youre good with numbers small businesses need help with this constantly. Quickbooks isnt hard to learn\r\n\r\nVirtual assistant work – lots of entrepreneurs need help with random tasks. Not glamorous but steady\r\n\r\nThe faceless tiktok thing the other person mentioned can work but it’s a grind and algorithm dependent. Personally I prefer skills where youre getting paid directly for work not hoping for views\r\n\r\nWhatever you pick, spend the first few weeks actually learning it properly. Youtube has free tutorials for pretty much everything. Then start reaching out to people who need help\r\n\r\nBeing stuck at home is actually perfect for this. No distractions, full focus. A few months is enough time to get decent at something and start making money from it",

If you can't find a buyer you can always return it too.\n\n\nAlso if you go directly on amazon.com enter \"warehouse deals\" in the search field, this also lets you look through their warehouse items, however they've made it increasingly hard to see what's actually in stock without clicking on the item first. Another excellent way to source product is if you're lucky enough to have online auctions with local pickup near you. You'd be surprised how cheap you can get things simpl because you don't have competition.\n\n\nPlaces like maxsold.com list estate sales, auctions etc nearby Also places like canoe.com, keepa.com and camelcamelcamel.com are useful for finding lightning deals to flip as well. Just check camelcamelcamel to see how much it's worth regularly.\n\n\nRules, always meet in public, preferably somewhere you can get to withir 2 mins or less. And never leave until they say they've arrived. This way you don't actually waste any time if people decide to ghost you (which will happen)",

      "selftext": "I cannot finish large important projects\n\nI cannot finish large important projects, I know this is related to my trauma and CPTSD but I’m not exactly sure how.  I basically would like to improve my life and the only way I can do. This is to accomplish large important projects and goals, but I cannot finish. I’ve been trying to do this for more than a year.\n\nI will give you some examples: \n\nIt’s really important for me to start a side business that will actually generate meaningful income. I have exact anxiety and I’ve been diagnosed as having major depression yet I force myself to work on these projects every day. in the past year I’ve tried to start two businesses. I spent roughly 4 to 5 months on each business and they are currently at the state of being about 90% ready to launch.  I have a problem finishing the other 10% so that they are ready to present to the public, advertise to obtain new users, and begin taking payments and generating income.  The reason for this is, I work so hard on these projects and I put everything into them and become obsessed with them over the period of 3 to 4 months but by the end of that timeframe I have lost faith in my original business idea and don’t feel like the ideas will be successful in the marketplace so I just pretty much finish the businesses from a technical implementation, but I never put the finishing touches and make the businesses available to the general public. Instead, I start a new business and the cycle repeats itself.  \n\nFor instance, I made a mobile app at work so hard on it to get it up and running, technically with backend website with payment and user accounts.  At the end of several months, the app is ready to launch, but I have lost faith in my original idea, and I have no confidence that will even make money. So I never launch, instead, I start a new business.  The next business is an AI startup, I spent several months learning and programming and getting everything ready for lunch. At the end of several months, I realize that I don’t like my original idea anymore and even though the business is about 90% ready for lunch, I never follow through and now I’m thinking of starting a new business with a different idea.\n\nHow can I break this pattern? I’m considering hiring an accountability coach who will check on me and give me encouragement so I actually follow through on these projects. Is this a good strategy or am I just not disciplined? any comments appreciated.  ",

This sounds less like a discipline problem and more like you're protecting yourself from potential failure by abandoning projects before they can actually fail in the real world. Getting to 90% means you can do the work, stopping at 90% means something else is blocking you.\n\nAn accountability coach might help with the practical side of actually launching but it won't fix the underlying fear that's making you lose faith in your ideas right before launch. That's the CPTSD pattern you mentioned and worth continuing to work on in therapy.\n\nOne thing that might help is launching imperfectly on purpose. Like set a hard deadline that the next project goes live at 80% ready instead of waiting for 90%. It won't be perfect but it'll break the pattern of never launching. You can always improve it after it's live.",

I charge $20 per event (shows are like twice a week usually) and people book ahead. Payment is automatic, I dont have to do anything except make sure my own car isnt there on event nights.\n\nVenue charges $50 for their lot so my pricing works. Had maybe 3 situations where someone showed up late or parked like an idiot but overall pretty smooth. The app takes a cut but whatever, still making around $160 a month for doing absolutely nothing.\n\nNow ive got a bit of money sitting aside from Stаke and im trying to think if theres anything I could add to elevate the whole thing so I can start charging more. Like maybe some security cameras or better lighting or idk what else would make people willing to pay $25-30 instead.",

Nothing fancy, just filmed on my phone. Got maybe 200 subscribers total and then I just stopped cause I got busy with work and kinda lost interest.\n\nFast forward to last week, I was going through old emails and saw a bunch of notifications from YouTube about ad revenue. Turns out I had monetization turned on at some point (honestly dont even remember doing that) and these videos have just been sitting there getting views. One video about lubing stabilizers somehow has 140k views now and keeps getting like 2k views a week still.\n\nI checked my adsense and Ive made around $960 total since January 2025. Its not life changing money but I literally havent touched that channel in 6 years and its just been paying me this whole time. The videos arent even that good, I cringe watching them back but people still find them helpful apparently.\n\nNow Im wondering if I should actually start posting again or just let it ride. Part of me wants to capitalize on it but another part of me knows Ill probably get busy again and quit. Plus Ive already got some money saved up so this is just extra which is nice.",

I used to have these complex strategies of having some dividend-oriented ETFs, and then reinvesting those dividents in 2 parts: a small part on buying more dividend-oriented ETFs, and the biggest part buying long-term growth ETFs like XGRO or XEQT. I was about 10% earnings, but now I've sold most of the yielding ETFs and started to buy XGRO, aiming for a long-term return. That being said, this is \"theoretical income\" because I've reinvested it all, so both concepts of \"passive\" and \"income\" are highly debatable.",

You just need to figure out a way to get money in the first place to fund it first. In that sense, you could look into bonus arbitrage (basically like bank churning). You’re essentially exploiting companies that overpay for user acquisition. Like for example, a company pays a $30 bonus for a $10 subscription, which means you can profit $20 in under 2 minutes. \n\nIt won't make you rich, but it’s an easy couple hundred a month that can then funnel into ETFs. The only hard part is finding these offers before everyone flocks to them and ruins it. I currently use [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) to track current ones since it’s a free resource.",

You’ve already established that you make as much as your regular job per hour when you’re actively working and building your income stream but what you’re not accounting for is the fact that ‘some’ of that income is passive.\n\nIf you do nothing at all next month you’ll make $100 (ad revenue minus costs).  This is free money and while it’s not forever you could earn it for a long time and although you’re still small you’ve created a saleable asset.  I’m not up to date on what a YouTube channel sells for so someone else feel free to correct me but your channel is worth something like $3,000-$8,000.  \n\nNow if you add that into your hourly wages I bet you see things start to rocket and snowball getting your wages up into the XXX per hour range.  The best part is that you can compound, I don’t know what your growth rate is currently but you have one client now, what’s stopping you from having three by the end of the year?  Let’s grow that ad revenue 10% a month and get you to $500 a month by next year!  \n\nWhat happens when you get to 50k subscribers and you can easily add in another sponsorship stream and double or triple your income because of that added revenue.\n\nYou’re already making more than you would at your day job which is the biggest hurdle to overcome, now it’s smooth sailing to compound that growth.

An author who writes ebooks once and collects royalties for years is still generating mostly passive income, a guy who works one afternoon a week restocking vending machines is still mostly generating passive income, etc. \n\n\nYou are right that you need significant amounts to generate returns with virtually no risk or effort but plenty of people choose a different position in the risk/effort/capital/reward matrix and that’s ok.",

It’s not fully passive (I still edit/post/manage versions), but it’s the first thing I’ve built where my back catalog keeps paying after the initial work is done, and that’s a weirdly good feeling.\n\nWhat changed everything for me was going multilingual without turning it into a whole production company. I record once in English, then I make Spanish + Portuguese versions with AI. I’m not really building much infrastructure either — I’m using managed services so I can turn them around fast. I also lean into template-style formats where the structure/visuals are consistent, but the voiceover/script is still original and 60s+, so I can batch multiple languages without reshooting everything.\n\nIt’s not perfect, and I’m honestly surprised it’s working at all. Trying to push it closer to “passive-ish” over time by building a bigger catalog...",

Made little spikes of income here and there, nothing sustainable, nothing I could confidently grow.\n\nWhat finally started working was treating one thing like an actual product business instead of a quick win. I’d been curious about SaaS but assumed it was too “serious” compared to easy hustles. The only reason I even tried was seeing a bunch of small, bootstrapped SaaS case studies in [foundertoolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) that started from where I was: no audience, no funding, just skills and time. The difference with this route was that the first dollars I made were from people paying monthly for something that actually solved a problem, not a one-off trick. I followed a validation and launch sequence I found there: weekend idea tests, pre-sell a tiny group, launch across 20+ small channels instead of only one big platform, then commit to a few months of content to keep traffic coming.\n\nMy first product is nothing crazy. It’s a simple niche tool solving one specific workflow headache. MRR is just over $1,200 right now, but psychologically it’s a different world from one-time hustles. Revenue comes in every month without having to constantly find new buyers from scratch. The biggest surprise was realizing I didn’t need some viral idea or massive audience, just a boring, well-executed system. Seeing dozens of people turn that system into $1–10K MRR made it feel less like a gamble and more like a skill I could learn. It’s still work, but it finally feels like I’m building an asset instead of chasing the next tactic.",

Then payouts started trickling in. Nothing life-changing, but I’m a couple hundred dollars in now, just from people using the voice, and I haven’t touched it since the initial setup.\n\nWhat surprised me most was how front-loaded the work is. Record clean samples, follow the guidelines, upload, and then it just… sits there. Obviously not everyone’s voice will be in demand, but it feels similar to stock photos or music licensing, just with your voice and AI.\n\nI’m curious if anyone else here has tried voice licensing or other AI-adjacent passive income plays like this. And if anyone wants details on how I learned the process, feel free to comment interest in the inbox not sure mods would be cool with links in the comments.\n\nWould love to hear if others are experimenting with this space or think it’s just a short-term thing.",

I have time to learn something new, test it and figure out some way of earning decent passive income. However I am really new to this. AI is all about starting affiliate program, POD etc. But I would love to know from this community about what avenues would you suggest for me to get started? \n\nNot sure if my work profile is relevant, but i have been working as a ecommerce product manager for past 5 years or so.\n\nAppreciate your help.

I’m nowhere near quitting my day job, but it’s solid extra income I can work on in my spare time while building a catalog of content that keeps selling.\n\nIt’s adult ebooks. NSFW. Turns out there’s real demand.\n\nI sell across multiple storefronts and slowly build a reader base that follows my work. About half of my process uses AI, but the other half is creativity and editing. If you rely only on AI, you get buried in low-quality content fast.\n\nThis is very niche, and most people don’t make much. But it is possible. From what I’ve seen, there are quite a few people doing very well in this space.\n\nI also sell custom stories. They take more work, even with partial AI assistance, but I’ve made almost $2,000 this year from just five of those commissions.\n\nEdit: I learned everything through authormeta.com (the Erotica Author QuickStart Guide)",

You do the work once, then improve it over time. Not instant, but repeatable.\n\nContent + affiliates\nWriting posts, answering questions, or making short content that links to tools you genuinely use. Slow at first, compounds later.\n\nRoyalties / licensing\nStock photos, music, designs, or assets. Very competitive, but low maintenance once uploaded.\n\nAutomation of an active skill\nTurning something you already do (freelancing, consulting, teaching) into a template, resource, or product.\n\n\nAnything that claims “fully passive with no effort” is usually just selling the idea, not the income.\n\nIn my experience, the closest thing to passive income comes from building something small that keeps working even when you’re not actively chasing people.\n\nCurious what others here consider “passive”.

          "body": "You’re already doing really well for 17, seriously. Most people your age aren’t saving anything. First thing I’d say is don’t rush into a business just because you feel like the money needs to be doing something. A lot of people lose their early savings forcing ideas that aren’t ready yet. Short term, keep the cash safe and boring. High interest savings account so it’s not just sitting there doing nothing. That gives you flexibility and buys you time.\n\nIf you want to start learning investing, you can slowly drip a small amount into a broad market ETF just to understand how markets move. No need to go all in. Think education money, not get rich money.\n\nFor business, invest in skills before ventures. Learn something practical you can monetise later like sales, marketing, editing, coding, or even running small online pages. Skills compound way faster than most “passive income” ideas you see online. You’ve got time on your side. Protect the capital, build skills, and let opportunities show up instead of forcing them.",

Distribute it equally so that, for example, Abbie and coke and visa pay you every January, then in the second, third and fourth quarters. Then find three more aristocrats that start paying in February and the months following your January payouts, etc and do this untill your whole calendar year is filled out. Set as many as you can to reinvest the dividends everytime they pay out. Eventually you will see this snowball turn into an avalanche as the reinvestment compounds. Keep building. Always stack these aristocrats throughout the months based on their dividend payouts. These are boring stocks. No need to watch the stock market because you didn't buy them to sell them. They are old boring companies who have saturated the market. What is exciting is that these companies have been consistently paying quarterly dividends to their owners for 25, 50 years or longer. Buy every sector or choose to leave out the ones with evil practices. It's up to you but at the age of 17 you will be starting out the way Warren Buffet and Charlie Unger did so many years ago. You can also just buy the s&amp;p 500 index fund and set it to reinvest. Just keep adding when you can and retire early when it snowballs and you can live comfortably on the dividends alone. Then stop the reinvestment in your Schwab or fidelity account (whatever has the lowest maintenance fees) and let them dividends payout every month into your bank account.

I personally withdrew BNB directly to my Binance account and exchanged it for my currency. It's not a fortune, but extra income isn't bad. I'd share the link here, but I'm not sure if I'd get banned for it, so if you're interested, you can message me on Telegram @efrainpabon and I'll send you all the information.",

The role is explained, the responsibilities are listed, the culture is highlighted. But the pay is missing.\n\nSalary info matters. It helps applicants quickly understand if the role is realistic for them. It saves time for both sides. It allows candidates to honestly evaluate what they can bring to the table and decide if the role is worth pursuing.\n\nEven if you can’t share the exact amount, at least include a salary range. That alone gives clarity. From there, applicants can choose to move forward and negotiate if they believe they can deliver more value.\n\nNo one wants to go through multiple interviews only to find out the offer doesn’t align with expectations. Transparency from the start builds trust and attracts the right people.\n\nApplicants deserve clarity. And companies benefit from it too.",

      "selftext": "I started my affiliate site about home organization products in march and spent the first 4 months focused entirely on SEO which got me basically nowhere, maybe like 200 visitors monthly and $12 in Amazon affiliate commissions total\n\nI switched focus to pinterest in august after reading a case study here about someone crushing it with pinterest affiliate marketing and figured I had nothing to lose since SEO wasnt working anyway.\n\nMy setup: Pinterest scheduler: tailwind, Pin designs: mix of canva and tailwinds ai generator, posting frequency: 10-12 pins daily, Content: product roundups, comparison posts, how-to guides\n\nNovember numbers:\n\n- 8,340 pinterest visitors\n- 287 Amazon clicks\n- $1,950 in affiliate commissions\n- CTR from pinterest: 3.4% (way higher than I expected)\n\nThe game changer was scheduling all posts bc I can batch create a month of pins in like 3 hours on one sunday and then it auto-posts everything optimally timed, before this I was manually posting and it was killing my consistency. Also tailwinds communities feature exposed my pins to thousands more people organically.\n\nSmartpin feature generates multiple design variations automatically which saves insane amounts of time vs designing everything from scratch in canva. I compared pins made with smartpin vs canva and tbh they performed about the same so now I mostly use smartpin cause its way faster.\n\nThings that surprised me: pinterest traffic converts better than google traffic for affiliate offers, people are already in research/buying mode. Comparison posts (Product A vs Product B) get 2x more saves than generic roundup posts. Vertical pins crush square pins, not even close.\n\nChallenges: Takes 4-6 weeks to see real momentum so don't expect instant results. Pinterest algorithm is inconsistent, some pins randomly go viral and others flop for no clear reason. Tailwind cost adds up but ROI makes it worth it once traffic scales\n\nFocusing on pinterest instead of just SEO was probably the best decision I made for this site, google is so saturated now in most niches anyway.",

If the owner gets lazy and starts to think they can afford to hire more people and the employees dont care cuz its just a job, quality goes down and regulars notice. or If the owner gets greedy, they start to pay themselves more, but dont plan on vital equipment needing maintenance over time. stuff like that can fail a business. people can make a bunch of money off restaurants and still let the business fail because they know how to start another one somewhere else.",

A lot of people are enticed by one (much like people are to stocks or gambling or sports, arts, politics, you get the idea) and wither without the other.\n\nPersonally we had a marketing (mostly signs, cards, flyers etc) store, a restaurant, barbershop, drugstore (convenience store? twice, among other side hustles. Some failed, some \"failed\" and some FAILED. For example the restaurant just didnt have a large enough clientele where we had it so we sold everything and mostly evened out. The brbershop worked but there was... scalping and some other shenanigans that forced us to close after a very large swindle involving a lawyer (that was 20 years ago tho). One convenience store failed because of bad timing and little cushion below it... a few more months and it would have been \\*quite\\* profitable as the zone boomed, but we ran out of money after a bit... less than two years iirc. The second one was completely mismanaged and none of us had time, it was qutie improvised, that definitely was a waste of money.\n\nGenerally, if you understand a business, have enough money and get a half decent spot, you will at the very least coover your expenses and get a little extra most of the time. I wont lie to you and say the majority of businesses are able to feed you, but a big big chunk in this gorup does. Its just that you might not be ok with merely an \"ok\" situation, at that point it is just a crappy job with no safety net either, but at that point you sell it to someone that wants something small to work on, someone ambitious would still chase the big bucks (and by big bucks I mean equivalent to a well paid profesional, bit more bit less.

Margins are razor thin, labor is expensive and let's just say attracts a certain mindset of person. And especially when a restaurant gets large, you need to hire managers to manage it for you and one or more bad managers can sink you rapidly by driving away customers and dramatically escalating your costs.\n\nAlso because the people who start restaurants usually aren't business people they don't plan for the future terribly well. They're focused on what's going to make money THIS WEEK and cover payroll, bills and so on. They're tactical thinkers because that's what a restaurant requires day to day... but the actual business of the restaurant requires strategic thought and planning. You also have to be able to step back and do proper financial analysis to figure out what's working and what isn't, and you have to be detached enough from the \"passion\" of the restaurant to even abandon things you thought would work but clearly aren't.\n\nAdd to that the fact that the business is cutthroat... and not just with other restaurants. For every restaurant there are a half a dozen suppliers who are all vying for their piece of the pie and most of those have very little competition in their particular field thanks to business consolidation. I use liquor as a great example, as a restaurant I would have to buy from a wholesaler but thanks to consolidation of businesses there are only like 3 wholesalers in town who all basically put the same prices on everything. It's shockingly easy to lose money on liquor too thanks to licensing and insurance costs, as well as the staffing and training (and wastage) that you will have with it.\n\nWith the economy the way it is, people have cut back drastically on going out to eat. It's brutal out there and I'm seeing so many restaurants literally on the verge of closing in the next few months. Most don't have cash reserves and are fighting the same uphill battles most of us fight in our daily lives; food costs are rising, utility costs are rising and in many areas rent increases are out of control. Literally my only saving grace with that restaurant is that I own the building and there are other businesses in that building that (mostly) cover the mortgage. \n\nI keep it going though so that my regulars can get their favourites, and so that my employees have a consistent paycheck. Business is 1/3 of what it was two years ago and we've had to make a lot of hard choices in order to keep it going. Even in the new year we SHOULD be raising prices because of the amount or food costs have risen since our last increase over a year ago. But we can't... if we do then any revenue increases will be offset by a reduction in volume of people coming in. 2026 is going to be incredibly hard for restaurants.",

But they won’t understand why people don’t visit their restaurant or avoid specific dishes. All the while, they’re paying utilities, wages, rent, and throw away pounds upon pounds of food. \n\n\nMost of all, they don’t think their restaurant will suffer the same problems as others: theft, no call no shows, poor talent pool, interpersonal conflicts, scheduling issues, inventory issues,  food safety violations, and poor reviews. \n\n\nThe people who are the hardest workers on earth could have critical flaws with handling finances, inventory, or employee issues. The people who are whizzes for financial stuff or connecting with employees could be the laziest person in the restaurant. It’s rare to have all the pieces fall into place and work harmoniously. A fantastic chef can’t outweigh a terrible front of house experience, for instance. \n\n\nPeople simply think a restaurant is easier to run and manage than it is. Employee issues, ineffective management, and poor customer reviews can all be soul crushing. The unpaid bills just speed up how long it would have taken the owner to close up shop.

I now have zero desire to do that...the PM's at my medium-sized company make over 200k+/year but never stop working, and I know that's kind of the industry norm.

Best case scenario, by the time I finish my apprenticeship I will have a successful/growing business on the side that I can turn into a full-time gig. \n\nWorst case scenario, the business doesn't take off like I hoped but I'll still be a union journeyman making decent money. I'll make a living while I figure out my next adventure. \n\nI know you didn't ask for advice, but since we come from similar backgrounds and are the same age I feel compelled to share something I've been struggling/realizing lately: Reading self-help books is good but it will never replace actually doing \"the thing\", know what I mean? Those books make us feel good and artificially better for reading them, but they mean nothing if we don't practice their teachings. Don't get caught in that trap like I did. \n\nGood luck brother.",

You have to decide what you want to look like in 6 months, 1 year and 5 years, use a solid, well-known system and do the work EVERY DAY. It's hard work starting a business; it's like pushing a boulder up a hill on your own. No one wants to help until you get to the top. I kept trying to cut corners, but when I stopped doing that and just worked hard and put myself out of my comfort zone, I succeeded. \n\nHandyman business sounds credible and doable. It's also something you can build to a great size if you think big. Easy to start. Start with cards and local ads; do it in your spare time, and charge the rate you will need next year when you're paying someone else to do the job, too. Please don't do anything cheap; it will backfire later.",

There's a lot of money to be made doing things others don't want to do. Many property maintenance companies make more money than the property owners. Many plumbers make more than the home owner they service. Tons of people making 60k a year pay 300 once or twice a year to get their car detailed. And so on.

The fact that you are reading daily, thinking in terms of skills and ideas, and already investing puts you ahead of many people who look “established” on the surface.\n\nI did not come from a strong educational background either. I learned most things by doing, failing, and restarting. I have had businesses that worked, then collapsed completely. At one point I went back to zero financially. What kept me moving was not some big breakthrough idea, but stacking skills that could transfer across industries.\n\nOne thing I would suggest is to focus less on hit or miss ideas at the beginning and more on skills that directly tie to cash flow. Property maintenance is a great example because it solves a real problem and people pay for that consistently. Once you have steady income, experimenting with games, music, or ebooks becomes way less stressful.\n\nI work in video editing, social media management, and media buying, and one thing I see constantly is that businesses do not need genius ideas. They need people who can execute, communicate, and stay consistent. Those are learnable skills, not things tied to formal education. I learned most of it online, through practice and working with small business owners.\n\nAlso, do not underestimate your construction background. It already gives you discipline, problem solving, and work ethic. You are not starting from scratch, you are pivoting.\n\nMany people who “made it” later did not have a straight path. They just kept moving, learning, and adjusting. If you keep building practical skills and stay patient, things do compound, even if it does not feel like it year to year.\n\nYou are not late. You are just early in the part where it feels messy and uncertain.",

          "body": "I'll weigh in on this. I have nothing more than a high school education, and I completely shifted industries that I was working in, back when I was 32. My entire work history up until age 32 had absolutely *zero* relevance to the industry that I went into (real estate sales and property management, and property maintenance). For context, I am now nearly 50, and own &amp; operate two businesses; one of which is a handyman/remodeling business. \n\nI am still the key driver in each business, so I have a good ways to go; given that the goal is to build something that can function for weeks or months at a time without me around. I currently own my own jobs, and am not yet officially a \"business owner\" or \"entrepreneur\". I like to think that I'm on the right path, but have not \"made it\" yet. \n\nSo I've been toiling away for 18 years on this, so far. I've made some insanely big mistakes, that set back my progress in some significant ways. But I've also had some good fortune and not-so-bad decisions.\n\nMy short take on it: you have *plenty* of time to create huge success. And given your work experience and financial savings, you are better positioned than I was at your age. Time is definitely on your side. \n\nTo use the poker analogy: it sounds like you have a very good hand. Not an AMAZING hand, but a very good hand. If you play that hand super well, you could crush it. If you play the had moderately well, then you'll do pretty good. And if you play it poorly... well, you know.  \n\nAre you listening to the Contractor Evolution podcast? That's a good one, in my opinion, if property maintenance is definitely the direction that you want to go. \n\nAnother thought on property maintenance: you'll need to decide on whether you want to be self employed and doing the work yourself, or if you want to be running a business with employees. I've known a lot of self employed contractors that are doing far better financially than the small business owners. In my observation, there is a lot of success to be realized for the independent operator as well as the mid-to-large business owner; but the grey area in between... the small business owner... often struggles. That's because having a couple company trucks and employees requires a lot of time, energy, and money, and the profit margin on only having a couple of employees is barely enough to make it viable. So to make that business model a success, you have to get past that tipping point. \n\nAll of that is to say: being an independent owner/operator is a completely different paradigm from owning a business that has an office manager, service technicians, trucks, warehouse/office space, etc, etc. Both options can be financially successful, but they require vastly different skillsets, and you need to decide for yourself which option you want for yourself.",

The whole performative productivity thing. And I was miserable and Ailog, the business wasn't even growing that fast.\n\nThe breaking point was a Thursday afternoon when I sat at my desk for 3 hours and literally couldn't make myself do anything. Just stared at the screen. Brain completely empty. I thought something was medically wrong with me.\n\nTalked to a therapist. She asked me what I did for fun. I couldn't answer. Asked me when I last took a day completely off. Couldn't remember. Asked me if I actually enjoyed running this business. I started crying which was embarrassing but also clarifying.\n\nHere's the thing nobody tells you. Productivity systems are designed for people who aren't working enough. If you're already working too much, optimizing your work just means you burn out more efficiently.\n\nWhat actually helped was cutting my hours. Not optimizing them. Cutting them. I went from 70 to 45. Felt terrifying at first. Felt like I was abandoning the business. But the business didn't notice. Revenue kept growing at roughly the same rate. Some things just didn't get done and turns out they didn't need to get done.\n\nThe 25 hours I got back went to sleep, exercise, seeing friends, and just existing as a human. My actual productive output during the 45 hours is now higher than it was during the 70. I can think clearly again. I can make decisions. I don't dread Monday anymore.\n\nMore hours isn't more output. It's just more hours.\n\nAnyone else been through something similar?",

If there's something truly critical or urgent they will get a hold of, don't worry. Shield your damn energy and focus, that's the only things you've truly got. Time has no value if you have attention span of a toddler.\n\nShare your experience.\n\n",

On sunday I only try to organize the next workweek (make something like a todo with the big things). I have no work email or work apps installed on my phone. I can only receive work related messages when I choose to open my laptop and open the mail client. That helps a lot with being actually there with friends and not worry about things you can't do anything about at that moment anyway. Only business partners whatsapp me with important stuff over the weekends (which is not often, and is not being misused).",

Hell, you dont even have to have a passion for it, per se. You just need to deeply understand why youre doing it.\n\nTheres no magic bullet for drive, but here's what I've learned after building an 8 figure business as a result:\n\n1. Routines aren't enough. Rituals are everything. Routines can be broken, rituals cannot be compromised. For 12 years I wore essentially the same outfit every day, went to sleep at the same time, got up at the same time, ate the same things, etc. This wasnt because I enjoyed it, it was because it spared the energy thinking about shit like that, and allowed me to focus on building, working, creating.\n\n2. Health is key. The healthier you are, the more you can sustain. In the early years I drank a lot (part of my ritual 😬) but as the years went on and I began to get more intentional about my health, the days got easier. \n\n3. Have a goal (or goals). Affirmations, vision boards, mission statements, etc... I dont care what medium works best for you just understand why youre busting your ass so hard. And remind yourself every day.\n\n4. Finally, measure progress by months or years, never by days. If you try to measure progress by the day working like that you'll get discouraged, overwhelmed, and just shut down. But if you can look back on the years to see how far you've come, tomorrow has more purpose.\n\nIm sure theres more but thats what I can think off the top of my head. \n\nAt the end of the day you must answer:\n\nHow bad do you want it?\n\nAnd what are you willing to sacrifice to get it?\n\nBonus: Whats *really* important to you? \n\nMy two cents.",

This is also the case in the winter, but I go for half a block. Adjust timing as it suits you, some people do really well using a pomodoro cycle.\n\n- Context switch. This is super important. Never wear clothes that you would normally wear around the house. At least wear jeans and a decent shirt/hoodie. Don’t wear joggers, sweatpants, etc. Save that for when you’re done with your work. \n\n- If you listen to some kind of content, use headphones that are tethered to your desk. I consider this part of my context switch. In ear monitors work especially well for me because they’re sort of annoying to take off/on. This adds another barrier to just getting up and going to do something else. You can get really good ones that sound better than all of the expensive wireless buds/phones I’ve ever used for like $50. Simgot ew200.\n\n- I’ve caught flack for this, but it works, and there’s nothing that suggests that this will produce problems long-term. When I’m making a big push, I work in an entirely dark environment except for my screens. Doing this makes it hard to even want to do anything else that day. I don’t know if this applies for other people, but I heard about it first from Alex Hormozi, and he seems to have similar things to say. But if it gives you headaches or you can feel eye strain, don’t be an idiot. Use other strategies.\n\n\nAdditionally, have bipolar disorder, medicated to the point that it’s manageable. Mood swings are not nearly as intense and debilitating as they once were. Through mood tracking and watchings signs of swings, I can harness the good parts of hypomanic swings and get an obscene amount of work done, so that’s part of my strategy. These overall strategies can apply to all phases of my mood, and their effectiveness generally follows suit. Depressive episodes are possible to do this with, but I usually get less done and I am more easily distracted.",

Dipshits peddling the hustle culture crap make others feel like they’re failures if they aren’t always working, so they say they are. \n\nOthers actually believe they work that much. They don’t. Again, it’s just not possible to put in 12+ hours of active work every single day. Most of these so called “maniacs” work 6-8 hour days but since they’re obsessed with work or trying to appease the hustle culture gurus they’re constantly thinking about work. So to the, they’re “always” working.\n\nLast thing: OP you may not realize it but you’re perpetuating the bullshit too. “What’s your secret” implies working this much is impressive. That it’s aspirational. \n\nIt’s not. And if baffles me how many of you drink the kool aid. Most of you got into entrepreneurship to achieve freedom. To not “have a boss.” To not be controlled. Yet you celebrate those who work nonstop? That’s insane. That’s the opposite of freedom. \n\nA better question would be: for those of you who have successful companies/entrepreneurial careers, and did it WITHOUT killing yourself, what’s your secret?",

Do you even know anyone that is an inventor that lives off the money they make from inventing shit?Have you ever met anyone?\n\nOkay, so let's focus on things that already exist.You don't have to come up with a unicorn idea.You have to find value to bring to the marketplace.\n\nI own a company in commercial truck parts manufacturing and sales. I found a niche of parts, and sub divided it into a sub niche of 7 items with 28 configurations. I don't know shit about trucks or truck parts or any of that stuff, but I know all the stuff that you don't know. I just like that stuff, and I like business. You could say that i'm really good at it.\n\n The truck parts just happen to be the industry I worked in at the time. I find that if you seek your niche in the industry that you're currently working in, you have a higher possibility of finding it within months to a couple years of searching and researching. When you work at a job, you have insight to the industry and the behind the scenes stuff that the average person just doesn't whether it be in a restaurant or a law firm or a construction company. When I researched my part, I called the name on the bag. I also found out there was one other manufacturer. They are both made in america.... For every truck on the planet. They were the only two manufacturers. I worked at a diesel shop. So when I called them asking about pricing, they asked, how much a month we use, and eventually push me to a distributor. That actually gave me a list of all their distributors. I then called those distributors and got pricing. A week later, I called back the manufacturers to set up the diesel shop as a distributor. This gave us their distributor costs. So now I knew what wholesale and retail prices were. I understood.The volumes required to be a distributor from the manufacturers. And I had an idea of how many parts were sold per year.Based on all of that information. I was also able to get the purchasing people at a couple other parts distributors to call\nand go through the same process to verify my information.\n\nI double checked the manufacturing to make sure they were not importing them. Import Yeti is free to use.\n\nI have google so I could do some basic searches to figure out how many commercial trucks are on the road. I worked in a commercial truck repair shop that did the repairs that utilized these parts so I was able to find out how often trucks have to have these repairs made. I was able to find out that this part has not changed in design since trucks were invented. I also found out that the seven that I chose out of hundreds were the universal components that fit a majority of the trucks. They're also required. Their non safety facing, so I don't have to worry about anyone dying. I sent some of them off to a lab to have mass spectrometer materials composition testing and made prints of each. \n\nI utilized import yeti to identify factory clusters in China, India, and Mexico that manufacturer's similar items.\n\nSteel, Zinc parts with strict tolerances, stamped, machined, cast, and plated.\n\nAfter researching factories, I understood what I was looking for in my own factories.\n\nMaterials, processes, in-house tooling and die making, QC testing capabilities, certifications, 3d printing, and packaging/labeling in-house.\n\nI found three factories in china that I reached out to via email. I also found a factory in taiwan that I used for my initial orders. Over the years, i've expanded to 9 countries now including the USA.\n\nI stored everything underneath my camper in a crate pallet or tupperware, totes with a blue tarp over it. Eventually I got a small self storage unit next to the rv park lived in. Eventually, we bought a home and used the two car garage as our primary warehouse with overflow, going into multiple self storage units locally. I picked packed and shipped everything until year five (2021). Then, I moved ninety percent of everything into a 3pl partner because I don't want to run a daycare and have employees.  \n\nI didn't do any advertising or marketing or online stuff at all.And I still don't. I cold called every single commercial truck repair shop dealership college o e.M in america and a double digit percentage globally, solo over the last 9 (10 years in a couple months).\n\nThe hardest part about my business is not sales or any of that other stuff. It's managing inventory to keep up with sales volumes and cash flow.Because all manufacturing turnaround is about ninety days. If you grow at five hundred percent, you're gonna have to buy fifteen hundred percent worth of inventory.Because the timeline drag, and that's a lot of capital to have to manage and flip with a growing business. You can't have back orders or someone will just go to your competitors that you had to take them away from.",

That doesn't just mean \"self development\" books from gurus. Read sales books, books on discipline, books on psychology, books on negotiating, books on human habits, and so forth. You never know which one will give you an edge, and you can easily throw on audiobooks while cleaning, driving, working out, etc.\n\n\nIf you're in a position where you can work your own hours or work remotely, commit. Too many people take this as a pass to sleep in, put in fewer hours, and hope that running the numbers game on Friday afternoon will make up for piss poor production the rest of the week. It won't. For some people, it will. Assume that you won't be one of those people.\n\n\nLearn to make a friend. With everyone. You don't have to like someone, but find something to like about them. Not everyone agrees with me on this, but I learned it in timeshare, and it will help you tremendously when it comes to establishing initial rapport with people you might not want to hang around with outside of doing business with them. The over exaggeration here is that if someone kicks a puppy in front of you, you should be able to compliment the shoes they used to do it. \n\n\nOutside of that, just put in work, be honest, and crush it out there. 💪",

Speaking as the founder of a local storage business in London, Lockit Local, the biggest edge you can build now is execution over theory: ship something every week, talk to real customers constantly, and force yourself to finish small projects end-to-end. Track actions you control (outreach sent, calls booked), get comfortable with rejection, take responsibility when things fail, and develop taste by studying great brands, ads, and offers so you know what “good” looks like.\n\nSkill-wise, prioritize sales first (cold outreach, discovery calls, clear value props), then go deep on one real marketing skill instead of many shallow ones. Over the next 4 years: learn and freelance cheaply to get reps, then charge real money, productize a single service, and systemize delivery so it’s repeatable. Biggest mistake I see new founders make: waiting until they feel ready. Start messy, learn fast, improve continuously.\n\nHope that’s helps",

My only regret is not tinkering with more projects in college - the fact that you're thinking about being an entrepreneur shows that you're ready to do it. You can work on it in small ways while doing classes, like only having 1 or 2 clients - learn how to solve their problems by doing, and once you're graduated and ready to scale a full agency, you already know what to do.  \n  \nThe best entrepreneurs are obsessed with finding &amp; solving problems - if your agency can start with serving a niche of people that have problems with their marketing, and you solve their problems really well, you're in a great spot. And the best way to learn to be an entrepreneur is to BE an entrepreneur - not learn general leadership skills or general marketing concepts from your classes. It's proving to yourself that you know how to make something from 0 to 1, which only happens by doing it. So do projects! Learn outside of your classes!",

      "selftext": "A close friend of mine runs a sales company. I’ve watched them quietly build this system over the last year, and it produced just under $1M in new ARR in 30 days. Here’s the breakdown of their sales operating system:\n\n\n\n1. Pre-call qualification (this is where most teams bleed time)\n\nThey don’t let everyone book.  \nCalls only get booked if the prospect is a real fit. Qualification happens automatically through:\n\n* Smart inbound routing\n* Short VSL-style videos before booking\n* Website pages that pre-educate the buyer\n* LinkedIn connection automation for long-term nurture\n\nOutcome:  \nClosers talk only to real buyers. Time-wasters are filtered before a human ever gets involved.\n\n\n\n2. Discovery &amp; research (without manual prep)\n\nBefore every call, the rep already knows:\n\n* Funding stage\n* Company size\n* Who the real decision-maker is\n* Strategic initiatives\n* Recent hiring signals\n* Timing indicators\n\nAll of this is auto-aggregated and summarized before the call even happens.   \nSo when the rep joins, they’re already fully briefed, without spending 45 minutes digging.\n\n\n\n3. Follow-up &amp; nurturing (where most revenue is actually won)\n\nMost prospects don’t buy on the first call. Their follow-up stack runs:\n\n* Automated value-driven follow-ups\n* Personalized video follow-ups (not just text spam)\n* Multi-threading across LinkedIn to hit all stakeholders\n\nNo “just checking in.”  \nNo chasing ghosts.   \nNo pipeline rotting.\n\n\n\n4. Why this closed $966K in one month\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, the leverage came from 4 things:\n\n* Only qualified buyers reach closers\n* Prospects arrive educated (less friction, faster decisions)\n* Automation removes admin from the sales cycle\n* Content warms people up before they ever talk to sales\n\n\n\nThat’s how they turned attention into real pipeline, and $966K ARR in 30 days.\n\nIf you were running this system, what would you improve or change first to squeeze out more revenue?",

Getting the first couple clients wasn't easy, but I'm getting more and more, and I'm hoping it ramps up even more the start of next year.

You're trading time for money. To get to $20K/month you'd need to either charge way more (hard market for that) or work way more hours (defeats the point of leaving your job).\n\nThe \"you'll never be wealthy as an employee\" thing is mostly BS. Plenty of people get rich with W2 jobs, especially in tech. Most small businesses don't make their owners rich either. Media companies especially are brutal margins.\n\nKeep doing it as a side hustle. If you can get to $10K/month consistently while keeping your day job, then maybe consider it. But jumping now with $3K/month and a family depending on you is risky for not much upside.\n\nBeing a good role model for your kid isn't about owning a business. It's about being present and not stressed about money all the time. Quitting a $130K job to grind 60 hours a week for maybe the same income isn't really an upgrade.\n\nNot trying to kill your dreams but the math doesn't work yet.",

At first, I felt like managing others was pulling me away from actually doing the work, so I tried to get more disciplined about it. I read up on management, borrowed parts of the systems I’d seen at my previous company, and adapted them to fit our size, hoping that a bit more structure would make things feel under control.\n\nBut as the number of projects keeps growing, I’ve started to realize that the chaos isn’t just coming from team management. A lot of it is my own project management and work habits. My days are full of short meetings, Slack notifications, quick syncs, consulting calls, client updates, and random “can we jump on a call right now?”. None of these things are useless on their own, but together they completely shatter my focus.\n\nWhat really shook me was a day last week when I had seven meetings, all under 30 minutes. By the end of the day, I was exhausted, but when I tried to look back and figure out what we had actually decided, everything felt blurry. I knew I had agreed to things, but without digging through messages and notes, I couldn’t clearly remember the reasons, who owned what, or the ddl. There are just too many decisions happening every day, and it feels like my brain can’t keep up with my calendar anymore. The more tired I get, the worse my efficiency becomes.\n\nSo I wanted to ask leaders who’ve been doing this longer than I have, how do you turn all this incoming information into a system that actually works for you? How do you make sure important things don’t fall through the cracks when your work is so fragmented? I feel like I’m constantly missing things, and I’m hoping to learn how others deal with this before it burns me out completely.",

          "body": "You are definitely not alone in this. What you are describing is less about workload and more about cognitive overload. When decisions, context, and follow ups are scattered across meetings, Slack, notes, and emails, your brain becomes the system of record. That is what burns people out fast.\n\nOne thing that helped me a lot was separating “thinking” work from “capturing” work. Every meeting, call, or sync needs a single place where decisions, owners, and next steps are written down immediately. Not perfect notes, just outcomes. If it is not written, it does not exist. Over time, this alone reduces the mental load because you stop trying to remember everything.\n\nAnother big shift is limiting where work can show up. Slack, meetings, and quick calls feel harmless individually, but together they destroy focus. I started pushing everything into a small number of async updates and weekly checkpoints. Fewer meetings, but with clear agendas and clear outputs. If a meeting does not end with decisions and owners, it was not worth having.\n\nIt also helps to move from managing tasks to managing decisions. Tasks change constantly, but decisions are what actually matter. I keep a simple decision log that answers three questions: what was decided, why, and who owns the follow up. When things get blurry later, I do not have to reconstruct history from messages.\n\nFinally, give yourself permission to slow the input. Growth often adds chaos faster than systems can handle. It is okay to pause new projects, say not yet, or batch decisions. Efficiency does not come from doing more, it comes from reducing the number of things competing for attention.\n\nBurnout usually shows up when your system no longer matches the complexity of your role. Fixing the system is not a personal failure, it is leadership work.",

          "body": "#SCHEDULING!   \n    \nIt is **THE** most important thing and makes everything else easy. People like to throw out the word 'discipline' but if they don't mention actually setting a schedule alongside discipline, there's a good chance they don't know what discipline actually is.   \n    \nJust so it's out there: Discipline is the practice of training people to obey rules or a code of behavior.    \n    \nBy far the easiest thing someone can do to establish discipline by having rules and a code such that they can achieve **anything** is to setup their schedule. On specific days, at specific times, for set durations, you do certain things. Then you just follow the schedule.   \n    \nOn $DAY at $TIME for $DURATION, I am doing $TASK.    \n    \nPersonally, this eliminates ephemeral things like motivation. I don't have to be in the mood to do something or decide that I want to do something. I already scheduled it. I don't have to think about it again. I just have to follow the schedule. The schedule is my rule, so I'm just following the rules.    \n    \nSo your rules to your behavior that constitute your discipline are:   \n1. Create a schedule. Pick a day, and a time as your designated scheduling time, and set your schedule.    \n2. Follow the schedule.    \n    \nIt definitely works, and you already know it works because it's used all the time. If you've been to any school ever, or any job, you've seen and felt how powerful scheduling is. Did you wait to be \"motivated\" or in the \"mood\" to go to History class or Geometry? No. The bell rang and you fucking went. Did you have to be in the right headspace to make it to work by 9am every day? No. You just followed the schedule. People in their 30s still wake up in a cold sweat because they had a dream where they were late for a class they haven't been to in 15 years. That's how insanely powerful scheduling is.   \n    \nSet your schedule, follow the schedule, and it will be difficult to fail.",

No “I’ll do it later”, no mood checks. If it was decided yesterday, today just executes. That single rule did more than any routine.\n\nI also deliberately chose discomfort that had no audience. Early mornings, boring work, finishing things no one praised. If the action needed external validation, I knew it wasn’t building discipline.\n\nAnother big one was shrinking the scope. I didn’t try to become a machine overnight. I focused on doing a few things every day, even badly, but never skipping. Consistency beats intensity every time.\n\nLastly, I stopped romanticising productivity. Most disciplined days feel flat, repetitive, and unremarkable. Once you accept that, it gets easier to keep going without needing a dopamine hit.\n\nDiscipline isn’t built by being extreme.

Ultimately, if AI is being used to make decisions, and your product or service is being talked about by the right people or publications, you’ve got a better chance of being surfaced by AI.\n\nI personally use ChatGPT to find products and services regularly to help me run my business and all kinds of things but I still don’t really trust it completely without checking references or cross searching some things myself. I don’t see search going away entirely simply because sometimes people want to dig through the results... And we are all still here on Reddit asking these questions too, right?",

AI answers still need sources, and those sources come from places that already have visibility and trust on the web.\n\nWhat I’m seeing in practice is that brands still get discovered through a mix of things: strong content, third-party mentions, communities, and existing authority. LLMs don’t magically invent answers, they remix what they already trust. If you’re not part of that ecosystem, you won’t show up.\n\nThe big change is you can’t rely only on “ranking a page” anymore. You have to understand where AI systems are pulling information from and why certain brands get mentioned repeatedly. That’s pushed me to focus more on being present on the pages and publications AI models already cite, not just optimizing my own site.\n\nI still treat SEO as the foundation, but now I also track which queries trigger AI answers, where competitors are being mentioned, and which sources keep showing up. Tools that give visibility into AI mentions and citations help connect the dots so you’re not guessing and help in quick execution.\n\nSo it’s less 'AI replaces Google' and more 'discovery gets redistributed.'

Backlinks from reputable sites, being cited in industry publications, having content that's genuinely comprehensive on specific topics. With our clients we've started tracking brand mentions in ChatGPT and Perplexity responses and the ones showing up consistently are the ones with strong PR presence and lots of third-party validation.\n\nThe tools tracking AI mentions are still pretty new and I'd be skeptical of anyone claiming they can \"boost\" your visibility in AI answers. That sounds like the next generation of snake oil SEO services. What you can control is creating content that answers specific questions better than anyone else and getting mentioned by sources the models are trained on.\n\nHonestly the bigger shift is that discovery is fragmenting across dozens of channels now.

After receiving it, I had some first-impression concerns and reached out to the company to talk through them and possibly return it.\n\nInstead of troubleshooting or pushing back at all, they immediately refunded me in full and told me to keep the unit. No discussion. Just “refund processed, you don’t need to send it back.”\n\nHere’s the unexpected part: after actually using it under real workload, the thing is phenomenal. Faster dry times, insane airflow, doesn’t bog down under resistance. It’s objectively better than some legacy brands I’ve used for years and clearly a serious professional tool with solid internals.\n\nAnother detail: this was the last unit they had available directly. All distributors I checked are quoting 5 to 6 week lead times on new stock.\n\nSo now I’m sitting here with a $760 piece of equipment that I didn’t pay for, is actively improving my day-to-day operations, and would easily pay for itself many times over. I didn’t ask for a comp, didn’t threaten a chargeback, didn’t exaggerate issues. I genuinely just wanted to talk through concerns and possibly return it.\n\nAs a small business owner myself, the whole situation feels… weird. Objectively, it’s a win. But it also feels morally awkward because that wasn’t my intent, and I know what margins can look like for smaller manufacturers.\n\nHas anyone else had something like this happen where the outcome is great, but it still feels uncomfortable? Or is this just one of those “accept the good luck and move on” situations?",

Thy had to do 3 separate shipments as each time part of the shipment was broken. The packaging was just not good enough.\n\nDifferent scenario. Recently my order was \"delivered\" according to Evri. I reached out to a company as I didn't received it. End up getting it twice by the end. I reached out to ask if they want me to return the second parcel. They must been using some automated bot as I got an apology and a refund straight away. Very odd.\n\nI use to wonder why people order from amazon. Now I wonder why people order anywhere else",

I can actually make a case that people who want to be in management sometimes ignore that having responsibility over employees isn't as empowering sa they think as they in some cases become baby sitters. Sometimes having a boss(and it has to be the right boss) is much better tha being the boss\n\nand lastly, one thing I can say from experience(and I'm a person who has been self employeed most of my adult life)..the 5-6 years I worked for someone, I'm not complaining about my current situation. I'm happy, I'm content...but I'm also more lazy than I hsould be(though my customers and employees are ALWAYS taken care of)..look, I'm on reddit at work? That is crazy.\n\n  \nso I was a music major in college and at one time was a pretty good musician(not I'm just fine)..but one reason GREAT musicians might study with an teacher(getting private lessons) isn't because they aren't able to record themselves and hear what they did right or wrong...but rather because a teacher keeps them honest\n\n  \nI do alright. My business is sitting pretty well(of course it isn't as if I don't have concerns about what the future holds but it has been awhile since I've really been stressed out about cash flow and overall business is decent...but I'll get a little anxiety in the middle of january as this is my slow time of year and I don't lay anyone off and it is sometimes hard keeping them all busy..but anyway)\n\n  \nI'm a hard worker and I think I'm a good boss and I was a GREAT employee. That being said it doesnt' take much to convince me to take off work a little early somedays...or take a friday off. Like I said, I'll take care of all my customers and my employees but there are always things I could be doing that are more productive when it comes to growing my business. I don't put off things i HAVE to do but I could be working on a project today that would help me boost revenue. I'm giving my employees the rest of the week off(i actually do have things that they could do in Friday...but it isnt' time sensitive.\n\n  \nmy point is if I had that teacher keeping me honest and making sure I was doing some of the things that would probably benefit my business..I'd probably be selling more but times have been decent so it has been kinda easy to take that extra time off where as some people would probably keep me more on taast",

You'll have to deal with customers.\" \n\nAs someone who has been in customer service for years, because the boss didn't want to deal with them or, I followed policy but, the boss had to step in, wanting to kiss the asses of customers who were becoming our biggest loss, due to the ass kissing and shunning of policy... This particular factor, is not a threat. \n\nCan you imagine not just losing a sale, but losing $1,200 in shipping, on top of the $1,200 sale or, spending an additional $800 to lose a $1,200 product, trying to satisfy someone, who cannot be satisfied AND they still leave a bad review... Just because that's the type of person they are?\n\nThe product was in high demand and short supply and, I could tell which customer was going to be a pain in the ass/loss, before they even spent their money... Maybe it's not great customer service but, if I had to choose the potential customer who called once, with some basic questions, prior to purchase, who was clearly going to love and know how to use it properly, vs. the person who called 4 times, to hem and haw over how expensive it is, wasting hours of my time, demanding a discount, \"I offered you 10% off. No I cannot make shipping free. It costs $450.\n And we only charge $200,\" while having no experience with or understanding of how said product works, I know whose order I should be cancelling or, at least not digging a deeper financial hole to China, in an attempt to make them happy. \n\nThe written policy was, \"if it has been used. It is not returnable.\" We can help you fix it but, we can't fix you. Literally every person begging for a discount, had buyers remorse and wanted to return it or, insisted it was broken and unfixable... We replace it once and maybe get the original back, to find, after all the technical support and replacement demands, they never even took it out of the box.",

The rest is answering emails, managing social media, tracking expenses, dealing with shipping issues, and trying to convince people my pieces are worth the prices I'm charging.\nLast week, someone asked why my necklace cost sixty dollars when they saw \"\"similar ones\"\" for ten dollars elsewhere. I tried explaining handmade quality versus mass production, but they just walked away. It's discouraging to have your work undervalued constantly.\nI've been sourcing some materials from Alibaba to keep costs manageable, which helps with margins, but I worry about maintaining quality while staying competitive on price. Finding that balance is exhausting.\nI'm starting to understand why so many small businesses fail in the first year. The romantic idea of being your own boss crashes hard against the reality of uncertain income and constant problem-solving. Some days I miss my old job security. Other days, I'm proud of every sale I make.\n\n",

Your target market isn’t customers buying $10 garbage. It’s customers interested in a higher quality product and willing to pay more for it. The key is you have to actually make it higher quality. \n\nThe question is also whether there is a market for what you’re selling.

At great cost and a steep learning curve she is starting to make money, but she still struggles a lot and in 5 years has made much less than her day job she quit.\n\nI have a family member who bought a local serciving business. I remember him calling me in tears. \"It's so hard, I have to do everything! I take calls, I set the appointments, I have to do the bookkeeping, I just want to do the work.\" He then blamed me for not volunteering to help enough, so I stopped answering my phone. He eventually sold the bisiness for less than half of what he paid and got his old job back. BTW I told him not to buy it in the first place but he was convinced it would save him and make him happy, it did the opposite.\n\nLastly, I have a super successful friend. Very talented and makes good money being an engineer. Every few years he and his wife get ideas of buying a business. Generally they come to me with an existing business costing $200k to $500k. It has been a restaurant, a cafe, a gym, and recently a sandwich shop. Each time I tell them the same thing, are you prepared to fail and lose all of the money and a year or 2 of your life? And have a miserable time during that time. I also tell them to test and find a business they can start with little to no investment of money. They then decide against it. \n\nThis is probably going to hurt, but almost everyone I know that \"made it\" with their business started in their teens and 20s. You have less to lose and you're more resilient when you're younger. People in their 30s/40s and older have so much more to lose and much less resilience. Think long and hard before quitting your job. Test the business first, and try to start with no or very little startup capital. Having capital upfront will not make you more successful or learn faster, from what I  have seen it does the opposite.",

So we'd do 5 + 3 instead of 5 + 2. And it's still more advantageous for employers in terms of number of worked days than some current attempts at doing 4 + 3.\n\nIt could make what is now seen as weekend work worth it. So both 5-day and 3-day work weeks would become an option, instead of the vast majority of people being constrained to being busy with work on the exact same 5 days per week.\n\nMaybe it could allow students to have feasible side jobs that are more than just pocket change. Or other weekend jobs that can be more substantial in income than if they were 2 days only so are then worth it. Or, for example, one parent works 5 days, the other 3, instead of one having to stay at home during the week because childcare is too expensive to be worth it. \n\nMany things that are now closed on the weekends could be running 8/8 days if there were 3 days worth of pay available to a separate set of employees. You could then call, say, a plumber on the weekend, because some plumbers would work 5 days, others 3 days. The idea of \"weekend\" would maybe change.\n\nPeople could actually travel to places if their time off was 3 days, as 2 days is often too short to be worth it. Maybe spend some time at their parents' house outside the city. It could make places that at the moment don't have much money flowing in, flourish.\n\nCould have many benefits.

So really I think it depends on the situation. \n\nThe advice I heard that I think is applicable here is to see if you as the business owner or boss are doing everything *YOU* should be doing to help the employee succeed. Essentially there are 4 things you should be doing. If you are doing all those things and the job is still not getting done, then it's time for them to go.\n\nThe four things you should be doing are ensuring they know what you want them to do, how to do the thing you want them to do, when that thing should be done by, and removing any obstacles that stop them from doing the thing.\n\n##1. What\nHaving a clearly defined role and set of responsibilities. If they don't know  what their role is and the responsibilities that come with it, they'll never be able to perform adequately. Clearly communicate the tasks they are responsible for completing.\n\n##2. How\nOnce they know their duties, confirm they know how to complete the job. For entry and mid level positions, SOPs are how you can give step-by-step instructions without having to constantly be present. For higher level positions that require more advanced or a larger variety of skills, and honestly most small business positions, training takes longer to get them familiar with how *your* business operates, or you're paying them enough to already come on with those skills already developed.\n\n##3. When\nIf they know what to do and how to do it, and it's still not getting done, then confirm they know the timeline. Tell them by when or how often they should be completing tasks. If you've told them once, remind them. You may not need to train them more, just a gentle reminder.\n\n##4. Obstacles\nIf they know what to do, how to do it, and when to have completed it, but it's still not getting done, check to see there isn't something external stopping them. The classic example is telling a chef you want a simple omelette for breakfast this morning and there being no eggs in your house/restaurant. Clearly despite the skills the chef has and the communication of your expectations, they won't be able to do it. Maybe the employee has an issue and they don't feel like they have the authority to \"fix\" the problem. Either fix it for them, go buy the eggs, or give them the authority and guidelines to fix it themselves.\n\nIf you as a business owner aren't making sure that your employees have everything they need to succeed, then you are failing your business in that respect.     \nSure, you may just have a bad hire, but that's also your fault for not vetting properly. Both management and hiring are skills you need to develop though, so it makes sense to suck at first.",

After they know the process, the goal is to set them free of supervision.

You shouldn't have to micromanage activity. If they're not willing to try their best, they aren't worth your effort. They will likely never change.\n\nIf you have to \"micromanage\" for quality or results (that's not micromanaging - it's training), it's often trainable as long as the effort and desire is there. There's an element of whether someone has the potential to succeed, but the truth is that most everything can be trained. Then, you have to decide whether the gap is small enough that you're willing to invest in bridging it. You should account for vacancy costs, hiring costs, and risk of new employee failure in that case. It's pretty high in some fields and VERY high in others (e.g. sales). The greater the complexity of the job, the more you should expect to train for quality and results.\n\nIf you're expecting to hire someone and for them to instantly be plug and play, then you're the problem and you shouldn't be managing people. That's not how it works for 99.9% of the population. Very few people have the tools to set themselves up for success in a new role and/or a new company.\n\nHire and fire for attitudes.

The problem is i have no idea how complicated US business registration actually is when you're not american. sp do I need an LLC? Most payment processors like amazon wants proof of a real US address not just a PO box. Has anyone here expanded to the US from abroad? Is it actually worth it or should I just keep shipping like this. Feeling a bit overwhelmed tbh, this seemed way simpler in my head when I first had the idea.",

It did affect me and our customers when the tardy types were 1-8 minutes late. It wasn’t horrible, but it was annoying.\n\nThe owners tried all kinds of things. Some were clever, some were punitive, some were incentives, they even tried something illegal, until that got shut down. Nothing worked. There was always at least one person late, every single day. And usually 2 or 3, out of staff of about 25. And it was always one or more of the same 8 or so people showing up late. Nothing worked.\n\nFinally, the owner gave up, and quietly approached the half dozen or so of us who were always on time or early, and just asked us to deal with it. For a price. Here, Uncle, here’s a $50 gift card. Hey, a vendor gave me this nice bottle of bourbon, but I don’t drink. You take it. Oh, she needs to leave two hours early today for a doctor’s appointment? We’ll just overlook that and pay her for the entire day. Hey Bob, these widgets aren’t selling, and you mentioned how nice they were. Why don’t you remove them from inventory as a store expense and take them home?\n\nThat was a pretty good system, because the people who were conscientious felt taken care of, and the people who were always late didn’t feel like they were constantly getting in trouble. In fact, it made the late people a little more conscientious, because there wasn’t always someone annoyed at them. It wasn’t a perfect system, but it made the owner think “who can I reward this week” rather than “who do I have to punish this week?”\n\nI still have a nice clock radio I got from that job.",

In roles where timing is critical, like childcare, customer facing coverage, or safety related positions, being on time is not optional. If coverage is impacted, then the expectation is clear: being late isn’t acceptable (PERIOD).\n\nOn the other hand, there are roles where output, collaboration, and results matter far more than watching the clock. In many tech and knowledge based jobs, no one is tracking minutes as long as the work gets done and you are not bottleneck.\n\nWhere it gets tricky is fairness and morale.

Here's what I found:  \n  \n\\- Vi⁤staPrint - Cheapest printing option, like $10-15 for 250 cards if you catch a sale. Quality is fine but they push upsells hard. Good for budget printing.  \n\\- Mo⁤o - Better quality than VistaPrint but more expensive, around $30-40 for 250. Worth it if you want premium feel but sounds like you're looking for cheap.  \n\\- Go⁤tPrint - Similar pricing to VistaPrint, decent quality. Bulk discounts are okay but nothing special.  \n\\- Mo⁤bilo - Digital option that's honestly cheaper long-term. One-time cost instead of reprinting every time. Lead tracking and analytics included. If you're tired of the printing loop, this makes sense.  \n\\- Ca⁤nva Print - Integrated with Canva if you design there. Pricing is middle-ground, around $25-30 for 250. Convenient but not the cheapest.",

Quality is fine for basic networking purposes. Moo is better quality but more expensive so skip them unless you're trying to impress.\n\nDigital cards are honestly underrated and I'd lean that way for most situations now. A simple link in your email signature or a QR code on your phone works for 90% of interactions. With our clients we've noticed physical cards mostly end up in a drawer or trash anyway while a LinkedIn connection actually leads somewhere.\n\nIf you do need physical cards for events or industries where they're expected, Canva has a print service that's cheap and lets you design without paying a designer. Or just order the absolute minimum quantity since your info will probably change within a year anyway.\n\nThe hundred dollar quote from local shops is insane unless they're doing letterpress or some fancy finish. For standard cards that's a ripoff and you're right to look elsewhere.",

The company closed their doors 4 months after I left, which of course I knew that was coming. \n\nI kept my philosophy  (that I learned, at the age of 21 from a very wise boss, who didn't scoff at me when he asked during my interview where I wanted to be in 5 years and I told him.) of giving the most dependable and knowledgeable service as possible, at the core of my company's mission statement. The clients could get the same products elsewhere but not the same level of service and industry knowledge that I had. I knew I needed to have a niche and there was nothing better than word of mouth. I got clients that were willing to pay for quality, because they saw what I did for others and asked for me. So for b2b, in a small town (pop. 160,000), I definitely did not need a website to get business. All that to say, being distinguished in your field is more important than anything else.\n\nI believe in a much higher population a website would have been useful. I spent way too much money and time on my beautifully visual and professional website. If I knew what I know now, I would just have a one page simple website. Saved some money and a LOT of time. I worked really hard on my website through all 18 years. Really, it was just a money pit. I had to continuously pay more for add-ons and tech support to keep the site running properly. That was in addition to all the other yearly fees.  Well, that doesn't work because you need to buy this other add-on. It never ended.",

Social platforms, marketplaces, and referrals can absolutely generate business. So no, a website isn’t strictly necessary to get started.\n\nBut owning a website is like owning your home.\n\nIt requires a greater upfront investment in time, money, and maintenance. In return, you gain control, stability, and long-term value. Most importantly, you gain intelligence. When you own your website, you own the data. You can see who’s visiting, what they care about, how they convert, and where opportunities are being missed. That insight is very difficult to get when you rely solely on rented platforms like social media or third-party marketplaces.\n\nOver time, that intelligence compounds. It allows you to improve messaging and offers, understand customer behavior, optimize marketing spend, and build a durable brand.\n\nSo while a website may not be required for your small business, it is critical for greater success. If your goal is to grow, learn faster than competitors, and build something you truly own, a website becomes foundational.",

I did have Instagram and Facebook business pages but tried giving those up in January in an effort to improve my mental health and getting off social media. Our store sales plummeted within weeks.

          "body": "I think this take has AI exactly backwards. I am not using AI to replace thinking, judgment, or human interaction. I am using it the same way small businesses have always used better tools, as a force multiplier that lets me do more with the same amount of time and energy.\n\nAI does not run my business. I do. It helps me draft, research, summarize, sanity check ideas, and move faster through the boring parts so I can spend more time on the work that actually matters. Talking to customers. Making decisions. Building relationships. If anything, it gives me back time to be more human, not less.\n\nThe fear that we will forget how to do things ourselves assumes people blindly outsource their brains. That is a choice, not a requirement. Calculators did not kill math. Spreadsheets did not kill accounting. Email did not kill communication. The people who understand the tool and keep their skills sharp are the ones who benefit. The ones who abdicate responsibility get weaker, and that has always been true with or without AI.\n\nAs for cost and dependency, small businesses already rely on software, platforms, utilities, and vendors every single day. The difference is that AI finally gives small operators leverage that used to require staff or agencies. That is empowering, not dystopian.\n\nIf someone feels overwhelmed by AI hype, the answer is not to reject it outright. The answer is to use it intentionally. AI should make me more capable, not replace me. When used correctly, it is not a crutch. It is a power tool.\n\nA couple of really helpful non-techie books that I like that cover AI are:\n\n“Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI”\n\nhttps://amzn.to/49imjL8\n\n\n“Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future”\n\nhttps://amzn.to/493PobQ",

In a consumption-driven, service-oriented economy like the US, what happens when nobody can afford the goods and services being offered anymore? The answer is simply really: the economy collapses. We are beginning to see this as the cost of goods outpace the ability to purchase them. What happens when there is nobody left with any discretionary spending money?\n\nUnfortunately, small businesses are going to disproportionately bear the brunt of this because they often depend on their customers' discretionary spending ability; think nail salons, hair salons, spas, saunas, bars, pizza places, etc. Small businesses in the B2B sector will also feel the pain when their customers, often the owners of the these nail salons, restaurants, and bars close their businesses or elect to take on additional responsibilities to save money. So small businesses that offer financial, legal, and technical services close their doors without customers. It's just circling the drain.\n\nI am certainly nowhere close to being an economist but I can see the ripple effect caused by the lack of discretionary funds available to many people.

          "body": "No one can answer this based on the information shared.  Many of these answers are shots in the dark. Doesn't matter what the gross revenue is, doesn't matter what the net revenue is either. Most people often miss the supply and demand of labor markets and just how integral the owner thinks you are. Nothing is stated about you other than your current position. Do you hold any licenses, certificates, degrees, that make you less replaceable? Do you believe, in the owner's perspective, you are indispensable not because of your chatbot bullets but with your responsiveness, proactivity, the relationships you build? Doesn't matter what you think do they view it that way? If you do not hold any specialized licenses or certifications, if you started looking elsewhere are there jobs available with what you are looking for? And more. The only thing that matters is they pay you minimum wage and treat you in line with labor laws.  The cost of living doesn't matter, the location doesn't matter, random numbers being thrown out without context is ridiculous.\n\nNow, let's assume you don't just do those tasks but you are indispensable. You do all of those tasks and do them better than most people with a similar resume as you. You hustle and have been a driver of the growth. You deal with employee relations and have some level of decision making power and do it all well. You are basically acting as a chief operating officer and an exceptional one. Without you it would crumble. Then the \"avg\" package doesn't apply. If you are integral and basically run the day to day, they should give you a package and treat you in a way you never want to leave, especially if you have other options. They need to realize without you, that work will fall all on them in addition to their business operating responsibilities, be spread out amongst the other employees likely burning them out, or  be completed by someone else, or the other employees, way below your abilities and quality.  They are fools to not have already been doing this if this is truly the case. There is a chance you view yourself as more important than they do or you are fairly replaceable but just going on what you said, they should be compensating you as much as feasible to keep you. That being said, all of those tasks, done in a mediocre manner just make you middle management in retail, easily replaceable. Reflect on your value and request a conversation. If you were my key employee I'd piss myself knowing your value and thinking you were even remotely feeling underpaid/undervalued or considering looking elsewhere. Good luck.",

For 19+ years, I watched all kinds of Entrepreneurs, startups both on and offline, small and mid-level businesses, and even my business go through what you're experiencing now.   \n  \nSo it's normal, almost an initiation of entering the business world. First, it's the setup of the dream, then reality starts to become apparent. You need to generate leads, drive traffic, engage, and move them to conversion and sales.\n\nThe more financially prepared you are, the less the stress. If you have the savings to pay for your bills while the business gains traction and builds, you are more likely to succeed than those who don't.\n\nSome operating on a shoestring can become successful. Some won't; the odds are against you, especially if you don't have real marketing and sales skills.\n\nThe real key is finding help that's seasoned and experienced in what you need next. Pricing is important, but don't judge capabilities based on how much they charge. I've seen a person who charges almost ridiculous low prices perform, and I've seen smooth-talking super expensive services fail.\n\nOver the years, you learn how to ask questions, and it's not always about the portfolio; it's about them explaining to you the what and how, and maybe even helping you first, so you learn to trust them.\n\nSo it sucks to be in the stage you're in now; it can go either way. If you want to discuss it more for additional knowledge, a discovery chat is always best because it's usually free with no obligation. You decide.\n\nMy DM is always open.\n\nHope that makes sense, Blessings!",

This was a low-hanging fruit so I don't know why I didn't do it earlier.\n\nLimitation: so far this solution only works, if your reservations arrive in email (in our case they are from a WordPress site (booking plugins like Contact Form 7 or WPForms)), and you use Gmail. If you want to replicate it, I'll leave the step-by-step descrtiption in the comments.",

          "body": "I don’t rely on motivation at all. It’s too unreliable, especially when you’re on your own.\n\nAs a solo entrepreneur you have to replace motivation with structure. Fixed work hours, a short daily task list, and a clear definition of what a good day looks like. When the rules are set in advance, you don’t have to feel like working to do the work.\n\nI also separate thinking from doing. I decide what matters when I’m calm, then execute when I’m tired, bored, or doubtful. No re-deciding mid-day. That alone removes a lot of friction.\n\nAnother thing that helped was tying work to consequences. If I don’t do the work, money doesn’t come in. If money doesn’t come in, stress follows. I stopped trying to sugarcoat that reality and used it as fuel.\n\nLoneliness is real in solo work, so I build artificial accountability. Weekly targets, public commitments, or even just sending progress updates to someone I respect. You don’t need a team, you need a mirror.\n\nSome days still feel flat. That doesn’t mean you’re failing. Most real progress happens on days where nothing feels exciting. If you can keep working through those, you’re already ahead.\n\nMotivation is a bonus. Systems are what keep the lights on.",

I was working as a senior user experience designer and she said to me, is there anyway you can get all of this into one app and make it much cheaper.

How to sync data across ios and android. I have been working on this for almost two years now and it's almost done.

I KNOW if you are managing to run a company of any size, you are capable of hard work, so good on you, but, what can take even more willpower sometimes, is being willing to put work aside and play, go do something fun! I can't tell you to not think about your responsibilities at all while you are away, but, rather than avoid work, gravitate towards living. Why did everyone who ever started a business do it? To live a better life! So do it! Or, regret it later. That is what I am trying to do personally.",

It used to be that mods were sharp about removing obvious spam and low effort promotion, but lately, it feels like more of it is just getting waved through. I keep seeing blatant review spam posted here, and what makes it worse is that it’s clearly getting fake upvotes and scripted comments to push it to the top.\n\nThis place has been a great resource for me, but allowing this much noise to slip through is a recipe for the community to go from great to worse very quickly. When the feed is cluttered with obvious manipulation, it makes the whole subreddit look unprofessional and eventually drives away the experienced founders who actually provide the best value. I’m curious if the rest of the 1k+ people browsing right now are noticing the same shift or if it’s just me. I’d hate to see us lose the quality that's built here, but it feels like the signal is getting lost in the noise and the moderation needs to be much tighter to protect the sub’s future.",
