Im just a random normal dude) create videos that brands use for their paid ads or organic social media. No following required, no crazy tech setup, just the ability to film, talk naturally, and understand/follow requests from a brand.\n\nFor me, this clicked because it rewards experience, not youth. The industry is full of younger creators, but many brands actually want creators who look like their real customers. Parents, homeowners, professionals, real people with life experience.\n\nIt took me 5 years of failed side hustles to find something that let me use my personality, storytelling, and creativity and actually get paid for it. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúeasy,‚Äù but it‚Äôs accessible, and it‚Äôs been life changing.\n\nIf you‚Äôre 35+ and still trying to find something that sticks, UGC is worth looking into.. it changed my life and as I was sitting here eating lunch I figured I would share because maybe it could change someone else's too.",

I kind of only half listened because he'd mentioned sportsbooks and betting and I really didn't want to get involved with gambling but the way he explained it actually made it clear that it's not gambling at all. So a few days later, I did my own research (im careful, but i think that's for the best) and more and more i realized how the whole thing worked. Because you hedge any bets you place, you are always making sure you have all of the outcomes covered so technically you can't lose and I know it sounds too good to be true but really it's just math. And then you use sportsbook promos to extract actual money. It's not a get rich quick thing but that's not what i was looking for, just wanted a small hustle i can pick up whenever i have time and not worry about it.",

      "selftext": "I‚Äôm an Automotive Technician with over two decades of experience.  I‚Äôve always worked for a dealership, but recently formed my own business on the side.  I went through all the legalities of doing it the correct way; where I registered with the state and county that I‚Äôm in, got my EIN, and opened a business account.  Once it was all set up, I made a website, leased an office space and started advertising on social media.\n\nIt started out slowly‚Äî after the first 30 days I was questioning whether it was even worth it.  I barely made enough that month to cover business expense.  However, it began to snowball after I landed some mid-tier jobs and started to get 5 star reviews on Google.  Consistent advertising through instagram fueled the fire, while creating content on YouTube on the cars I was working on showcased my skills.\n\nFast forward today and after a short 7 months in operation, I‚Äôve managed to build roughly $38k in business capital‚Äî all net profit.  The jobs I‚Äôm landing are also getting bigger.  I‚Äôm billing out dealership-level work orders and gaining repeat clients to boot.  Most recently; I performed a major engine overhaul on a clients car that was billed out at nearly $7k.  A week later he dropped his other car off with me to get it up to snuff on maintenance and any other repairs it needed.\n\nAs the work becomes consistent, I‚Äôm finding it difficult to juggle both the W2 and my own ‚Äúside business‚Äù‚Ä¶ which as of late I consider more of a full time business than anything‚Äî as all of the free time I have outside of the W2 is dedicated to building the business and scaling it up.  I know at some point, I‚Äôm going to have to choose between the two and I‚Äôm already strategizing how that will play out.  If things continue to accelerate at the pace that it has been, I see myself making the side hustle my main hustle and just picking up a part time job as a bartender or something‚Ä¶ start networking and gaining clients that way.\n\nWhen I formed this business, I had my doubts on whether it would amount to anything.  Now I‚Äôm proud of what it has become and excited to see what it will eventually be.  \n\nBest advice I can give anyone that‚Äôs thinking of starting something on the side is this:  \n\n‚Ä¢Identify what you do best, and capitalize on that and that alone. (I‚Äôm a Mechanic‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt make sense for me to open a food truck).\n\n‚Ä¢Be prepared and put systems in place to keep you organized- keep your books tight.\n\n‚Ä¢Realize there will be monetary risks.  Start small, budget wisely, and don‚Äôt get over leveraged.\n\n‚Ä¢You will make mistakes- learn from them.\n\n‚Ä¢Don‚Äôt chase $, chase client satisfaction and those 5 star reviews.\n\n‚Ä¢The reward reflects the time and effort put in.\n\nHope this was interesting and that it inspires some people.  üîß \n\n",

For example, I created 6 short-form videos per month for Gauth and was paid $120/month. Then, for Notion, I made 2 long-form videos per month and got paid $300/month.",

          "body": "Yeah, it‚Äôs definitely possible to make money without having a specific skill yet. At your age, the main thing is to start learning how money works and building habits that pay off later. You can try simple things first like reselling items online (thrift flips, sneakers, electronics, etc.), doing gig work like food delivery or dog walking, or offering services such as yard work, cleaning, or tutoring younger students. If you want something more flexible, you can do online tasks  like freelancing basic stuff on Fiverr or Upwork (data entry, writing short descriptions, etc.) or even managing social media pages for small local businesses. The key isn‚Äôt to find the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù skill right away but to start doing something that teaches you responsibility, communication, and consistency. Over time, you‚Äôll naturally pick up skills that you can use to make real money later. Everyone starts somewhere right so  just focus on getting started, not on being great yet.",

Do they all drive really expensive cars? Do they have fancy gardens and lawns? Do they all like to play tennis? etc.\n\nNow go home and look up the things you see those rich people doing. And see what jobs there are that help maintain those rich people things. Some of those jobs have a low barrier to entry. Like waxing fiberglass, it takes a $50 tool, some buffing compound, and strong arms that don't get tired easily. But people with money will pay to have their boat waxed every year because then it's shiny.  Or maybe they want to have their cars professionally detailed in their own driveway? Or maybe they want their leather golf club bag given some leather care and cleaning? Or maybe they'd like to have someone come to their house and use a sonic cleaner for their jewelry? Or have all their stupid-expensive knives sharpened up to 3000 grit? Or wash their walkway, driveway, patio, &amp; brick with a pressure washer?  Or have the numbers for their house repainted?\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nFind what people who have money don't want to do themselves, and offer to do that thing. If you don't have a skill, offer to do a thing that doesn't require a lot of skill, but does require a lot of time and maybe gets dirty. Things rich people don't like dealing with.\n\nStart your own business. As you get better at it, you can raise your price. As you get even better at it, the fact that you take less time means you can do more jobs without lowering your price making you more money. Maybe you can even hire a helper or two.\n\nThis is how my ex's brother went from student to independently wealthy in about 5 years. He just took most of the money he made (in his case lawn care) and spent it on expanding his little business. In the end he had multiple trucks, a whole bunch of lawnmowers, about 15 employees, and he sold the business to his best employee and used it to buy a McMansion for cash.",

You could also print out paper fliers and post them around neighborhood shops (with permission). Make sure a trusted adult knows the addresses you‚Äôre visiting to work. \n\nYou could also try offering babysitting, simple tutoring, or pet sitting services in the same way, but these services may be harder to sell with 0 experience. People will want to know why they should trust you with their kids (a you CPR certified? trustworthy? good with kids? etc) or knowledgable about pets, or that you are tutoring a subject you are good at (did you get straight As in AP Language Arts?) etc. Maybe you have a skill you had not considered before tho? \n\nThe other old fashioned way to get a job. I‚Äôd suggest restaurants if you can swing it, they usually pay unskilled youth the best, because you‚Äôll generally get a share of tip money in addition to minimum wage. Sometimes you can take cash home the same day you work. Any job will do, though! See if you can help out in a field you are interested in possible working in someday. \n\nThe new-fashioned way is online. Sell crafts on Ebay or Etsy, make videos for Tiktok &amp; YT.

Seriously.\n\nI‚Äôve tried everything‚Ä¶. Etsy shops, blogs, print-on-demand, random AI projects, Pinterest loops, even indexing experiments that made my laptop sound like it was about to take off. Most of them died quietly. A few survived. And the stuff that stuck honestly had less to do with talent and more to do with timing.\n\nFirst lesson learned: quit the guessing game. My 'cool' ideas always crashed and burned. But when I simply started paying attention to the data, like trending keywords, those sudden search spikes, and what people were actually buying, things finally picked up. It's unsexy, sure, but it gets the job done.\n\nNext up, I realized loops are king. Forget doing one-off projects; it‚Äôs all about creating these little engines. Like Pinterest traffic sending folks to a blog, or old Medium articles funneling people to Etsy, or even just old listings getting evergreen sales thanks to reviews. The best ones were the ones that just kept going without me having to obsess over them.\n\nLesson three, ditch the 'originality' obsession. I seriously thought I needed to conjure up something nobody had ever seen. Nope. Turns out, just taking a winning concept, giving it your own spin, and getting it out there quickly is a far more profitable game.\n\nThe rest? It‚Äôs mostly noise. Fancy tools, new ‚Äúgrowth hacks,‚Äù even ads, they helped sometimes, but not for long. What actually worked was keeping things small, repeating what clicked, and not getting bored when it got repetitive.\n\nOn paper, none of this sounds particularly impressive. But it's effective, and it just works, silently. And after diving into nine different hustles, I can tell you, 'quietly working' is now infinitely more appealing than the fleeting promise of 'maybe going viral.\n\nAnyone else find that the simple, boring stuff ends up working best?",

Night owl, so can go late.\n\nCurrent skill sets - Fast typing, above average user for Excel, work history is centered around customer service/management, people managing or training, usually in technology fields(ISP, Software and now security cameras). Can't code. Advent gamer(if it helps).\n\nHoping for something at home, was first looking for typing or 'email answering' jobs around the net, open whenever to do(could burn midnight oil) but nothing panned out or I just don't know where to look. Half thought trying Twitch but....feel like I couldn't make it. I see a lot of people talk about AI products, but I have no marketing experience.\n\n\n\nThank you for any advice. ",

Ask me anything you want to confirm.) \n\nIt‚Äôs a walking app.  You don‚Äôt need to spend tons of time on it, but it won‚Äôt make you rich either.  It‚Äôs just for a few extra bucks here and there.  You COULD put some time in it and make quite a bit more, but you don‚Äôt have to just to make a few bucks.  \n\nYou just log in at the end of the day and collect your steps with one button push.  If that‚Äôs all you do, it‚Äôll take awhile, but you can still make money.  \n\nThings I do to speed up making money on it now are:\n\n-1 survey a night for like 5 minutes.  They are too boring for me to sit there and bang out, but you could do a bunch if you wanted.  \n\n-collect the ‚Äúcards‚Äù Around town as you walk.  \n     -I do it if I‚Äôm riding passenger in a car.  Just open and and grab the daily seven cards as you pass them on the street lol.  \n\n-very occasionally play a game if it seems fun or they are running a bonus.  \n\n-referrals here and there when I can get them.  \n               -you get points and so does the person entering the code.  \n\n\nI have made 50-75 a month doing this for a bit now.  Not a killer income, but requires very little effort.  \n\nMy referral code is : \n\nPeacefulRhinoceros9144\n\nFull disclosure: I get 100 points and you get 150 points, or ‚Äúwards‚Äù as they are called, once you reach 200 wards on your own.  You could do that the first day too if you did one or two surveys, or just collect your steps at the end of the day but it‚Äôll take a little bit longer.\n\nOne of many apps I run to get low to no effort gift cards or Venmo.  Yes, they do pay out.  It takes like three days or so once you submit your cash out to get the gift card or Venmo.  \n\nHappy to answer any questions too.",

Like a brick wall or some such. \n\nFor extra money do some photoshop for either skin issues or transparent glasses. See YouTube on how to do that. \n\nI setup, 15 min, shoot 15 min, Lightroom maybe 30 min. I buy USB thumb drives in bulk from Aliexpress. Put exported Jpgs on it (3 different resolutions, low for Facebook, mid for computer background, 8x10 600dpi), parent can go anywhere for prints. \n\nGather stuff 15 min. I stay longer to ensure customer is happy and won‚Äôt charge more, to a limit. Depends on next customer that day. \n\n100$ - 200$ for such a service would be standard. Plus if kid is ready, all is done in 5 minutes. The other ten minutes (or more), get each parent also, whole family, etc. Bother and sister is very popular. Custom backgrounds are also very popular. \n\nI often just take random pics on vacation (beach), in parks and near landmarks with perfect noon-day sunny day just for this. I‚Äôm thinking of printing 8x10 or A4 format, 6 or 8 backgrounds, put in a catalog, have the parent select while taking pictures. \n\nSchool pics are easily 100$-300$ as you pay per printed kit. A cheap kit is like 100$. \n\nI shoot with Nikon D800 and lens for portrait mode.\n\nYa my setup is top notch but sometimes you can improvise, find used, and lower your portable studio startup costs.",

I spun up WordPress, let chatgpt and Gemini grind around 500 posts, added meta tags and whatnot, watched the analytics like a hawk, refreshed again, refreshed again also. Ad revenue after half a year was $28.35, which might buy me a lunch.\n\nI tried AI faceless videos too. Stock voices, avatars, tool recs. One clip hit 48 views, most did 30 or less, and I was down \\~280 for subs. A comment said it felt like an ad made by an AI for another AI, which is kinda fair and also also painful.\n\nI even pushed AI stock photos. Hundreds uploaded, ten downloads, $6.3 usd. The only thing that actually gave me money back was a price protection AI tool, clawed about $148.5 in gift cards from pirce drops. Not income, but defintely real cash back, unlike teh promise of passive anything.\n\nIf someone here cracked it without ads or an audience, I‚Äôm listening.",

      "selftext": "I‚Äôve been on Etsy for 2 years. When I launched my very first shop, I got just¬†**1 sale in the first month**. After years of testing and learning the platform, my¬†**6th shop**¬†did¬†**180 sales in its first month**. With the right strategy, sales grow month after month after launch.\n\nHere‚Äôs what it really takes to reach¬†**3k a month:**\n\n1. **Daily posting.**¬†Add new listings every day. Refresh old ones (photos/tags/descriptions) from time to time. The algorithm loves activity.\n2. **Product selection = competitor analysis.**¬†I use eRank to study competitors‚Äô bestsellers and only post products that already have proven demand -then I¬†**remix**¬†them into my own version (design, bundle, offer).\n3. **Discounts are strategy, not decoration.**¬†But also, I‚Äôve seen a shop with 40k sales that didn‚Äôt run ‚Äú% off‚Äù but used a¬†**bundle offer**¬†like ‚ÄúTake 2 posters and get 50% off the pair.‚Äù It is also good strategy haha.\n4. **Don‚Äôt ‚Äúsleep‚Äù after launch.**¬†Many people open a shop and then post nothing for weeks. Etsy gives you a¬†**Start boost -**¬†if you miss that window, it‚Äôs harder later.\n5. **Bad start? Reset fast.**¬†If your shop is cold for 1-3 months with no clear reason,¬†**close it and reopen**¬†with a sharper niche, storefront, and strategy. It‚Äôs faster than trying to revive a dead listing set. (I had this situation before)\n6. **Consistency or nothing.**¬†My friend hit 1k in first month with 3 bestseller listings. When those cooled off, she stopped uploading. She doing one listing a week, and it isn‚Äôt enough.¬†**Daily momentum = steady growth.**\n\n**A note on timing**\n\nThis month many sellers (me included) noticed odd shifts - sales dipped like Etsy tweaked something so much. If you‚Äôre about to start, consider waiting a couple of weeks for stability. Use that time to prep listings, bundle offers, and your daily posting plan.\n\nI have my own paid cheap on this topic, but I'm not linking it here to follow sub rules.\n\nLet me know what you think about :)",

These small bonuses usually are under a dollar or are exactly a dollar, which isn't alot. But there are 70+ of these sites available and I use all 70+ of them everyday to get my check in.

          "body": "Ten years ago, I got interested in making other sources of income like affiliate marketing, party promotion, arbitration, and selling drugs. None of these worked for me because I was very introverted and didn‚Äôt have the knowledge to persuade people to buy what I was selling. By arbitration I thought it was drop shipping and that just seemed like a bad idea unless you have permission to sell people stuff. Affiliate Marketing seemed like you are just trying to make people join something that you don‚Äôt fully understand and once I understood what a pyramid scheme was that‚Äôs what I saw in every business plan. \nBasically by pyramid, there is someone on top and the lower ‚Äúlegs‚Äù or level, or hierarchy or whatever you want to call it. Different levels of management is called a pyramid so I still think it‚Äôs in everything like the government, corporations, businesses, etc. \n\nSo I found something that works for me!\n\nIf you feel like you need to get away from all of the business stuff, the pyramid scheme, the classes that cost too damn much and all the gurus that can‚Äôt help\n\nLISTEN UP!\n\nSo when I found this thing called making money from your phone ten years ago, I was curious!\n\nHow do you make money from your phones?\nIt was of course part of a bribe or a marketing scheme that will get you into an affiliate marketing campaign called Imarketslive. \n\nI‚Äôm not promoting their products or the business but I am promoting what they taught me. \n\nSo, as detailed as possible, currency was created after the barter system. When people saw the value of trading people‚Äôs resources they were then ‚Äúenslaved‚Äù by materialistic things like gold, silver, bronze, wood, hay, bricks, rare metals and stones, upon other things.\n\nSo people found a standard system on which to trade which is the gold standard. Gold is traded to determine how much currency you have to purchase building materials, machinery, equipment, livestock, food, etc!\n\nGold along with money is transferred from the trading markets to the banks, held in vaults and only exchanged for big profits. \n\nA standard 24 karat gold bar is worth between $4,000 - $5,000 USD\n\nA 400 ounce gold bar is $1.3 million dollars or more!\n\nSo, instead of carrying around all of the gold from country to country, we made something that weighs less, can be easily replace, and is easier to transport.\n\nWhen technology advanced, we now can trade with the banks buying into money and trading with the banks as ‚Äúretail traders‚Äù \n\nA retail trader is anyone that has the means to trade online but doesn‚Äôt have a corporate bank behind them to trade money. \n\nSo, now that you‚Äôve reached the end I don‚Äôt want to borrow more time from you that I already have or you will have to message me to learn the system or process that I use to trade thousands of dollars on my phone or my computer without any work other than looking at fluctuating prices and lines that should be common sense.",

I have a lot of free time and tried everything I could online to turn minutes into dollars, this is the best thing I've found thats worth your time!\n\nWhen companies create / alter product lines.. they want to get a feel for how to general market will enjoy/dislike the product. Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

If you are starting an online business or getting into online work you should know that: 1. you need a proper plan to create a new market, create a completely new job idea; 2. every kind of work that you start up online is a small investment itself, which means you will most probably spend money trying to earn money (im also talking about advertising your product/service/whatever); 3. low effort jobs and no skill jobs are not well paid jobs (not worthwile), you must possess some kind of skill.\n\nDon't listen to Youtubers, try searching around forums and chats online and maybe, but maybe youll get lucky. You need to find a good contact or agency or smth\n\nThe market is oversaturated for most kinds of existing jobs, in order to earn money doing simple work you should travel in time 15 years in the past\n\nTake time doing what youre doing, patience is important, getting a good amount of money in a short period of time (less than a month) is highly improbable\n\nThe last thing is advertise your stuff, be the most annoying you can be with it, share it everywhere\n\nI know all of this advice is well-known stuff already, but im trying to help anyone new who wants to start online, hope i did.

Browser earnings have been surprisingly consistent.   \n  \nNot quitting my job but this covers my car payment now which feels good, aiming for $200/month by december.",

I consider passive savings to be the same as passive income ( or better since it‚Äôs not subject to income taxes). I earn about $3000 per year in cash back on credit card spend by using the ‚Äúright‚Äù card for most of my purchases.\n\nI started a lending business that required some up front work in underwriting clients, and about 30 minutes of ongoing work each week (so technically not totally passive) that made about $30k the first year, and was up to $100k by the 4th year. It‚Äôs year 7 now and the income is back down to around $65k a year.\n\nI used to post articles on eHow that would generate $30-$40 per month collectively.\n\nI‚Äôve subscribed to a site that lists class action lawsuit settlements, and when I see one I qualify for I join the settlement. Classaction.org\n\nI‚Äôve checked my name on the abandoned property websites maintained by the states I‚Äôve lived in and found some lost monies I was owed.\n\nI‚Äôve done medical research studies (in college) that paid a few thousand. Not totally passive, but not exactly work either.\n\nOnce upon a time there was a service called Earny‚Ä¶you‚Äôd sign up and give access to your email account and it would track online purchases made at retailers that offered a price match if the price you paid for something dropped within X days of your purchase. Sometimes that price protection was offered by a store, but it was also a feature of some of the premium credit cards. After signing up, I‚Äôd literally just get checks on the mail to deposit. I don‚Äôt believe that service still exists.\n\nI knew someone who worked at a coin collector who would pay a premium for certain collectible sets that would go on sale at a mint. As an example a set might cost $3200 from the mint (available in limited quantities), his company would offer $100-$200 above that, and I‚Äôd buy it in my credit card (getting $30 worth of cashback in addition to the cost plus premium paid back to me by his company). A bunch of us would do that‚Ä¶apparently the coin collector was looking for pieces that were ‚Äúperfect‚Äù quality in those sets that would fetch a far higher premium and he was still able to unload the new sets we ordered for a profit no matter what. That was like 20 years ago.\n\nI‚Äôm sure there have been other things over the years. I haven‚Äôt done any video content creation, digital agency work, or guides/eBooks. Never tried dropshipping either.",

By no means am I a pro, but here is what I do. \n\nI live in the Dominican Republic, and have started with a few investments. I have a motorcycle that I bought for $400 and a Tri-moto (basically a three wheeler but has a truck bed in the back of the motocycle.) Which are commonly used to haul building materials, trash, or help people move as well as many other things. The Tri-moto was $3000. Every day, except for Sunday the motorcycle brings in $4 and the Tri-moto brings in  $12. Weekly that is an income of $96, minus the $18 I pay to someone to manage this. So every month I'm making $312 for doing absolutely nothing. \n\nI know it's not much. But it feels great to be getting these systems started. It's about 10% of what I need to live my life, so a good start. The plan now is to save 100% of this until I can get another tri-moto. \n\nFeel like I need to say this because everyone here is always selling a course. Well, I don't have one. Just common sense. Find something someone needs for a job, and rent it to them. Everyone wins. ",

My passive income project had its \"best day ever\" with a $400 sale, which turned out to be a fraud attack.\n\nI almost got hit with hundreds in chargeback fees ($15 per transaction!) on top of the lost sale.\n\nThe scary part? This happened because Stripe's most important fraud-prevention settings are OFF by default.\n\nHere's the 3-minute fix to protect yourself:\n\n* Go to your Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Radar ‚Üí Rules.\n* Find and ENABLE the rules to BLOCK payments if:\n   1. CVC verification fails\n   2. Postal code verification fails\n* For ultimate protection, enable 3D Secure (3DS) in your payment settings. This shifts fraud liability from you to the bank, so you're covered.\n\nI caught it in time, but it was a massive wake-up call. Don't learn this lesson the expensive way.\n\nI wrote a full post-mortem on what happened, the exact fraud pattern to look for, and a step-by-step guide with screenshots on my blog.\n\nFull Story &amp; Guide:¬†[https://choy.in/blog/stripe-is-dangerous](https://choy.in/blog/stripe-is-dangerous)\n\nHope this helps someone avoid a disaster!",

Did you start a side hustle that paid you $50 for your first gig, even if it was crap?\n\nI'm not looking for a \"get rich quick\" scheme.

          "body": "I‚Äôve got several pieces of advice for you‚Ä¶\n\n1. Stop reading the get rich quick content. It‚Äôs a waste of your valuable time. It doesn‚Äôt exist. Overnight successes were generally years in the making. There‚Äôs no magic money tree that just makes you wealthy without effort. If you want a magic money tree, you have to find some soil, plant a seed, water it, give it the right nutrients, protect it from storms and the cold and the heat, prune it, and give it time to grow and blossom. Does that sound passive? It‚Äôs not.\n\n2. You have to just pick something and start. The thing you pick should be something that you‚Äôre interested in and have an aptitude for. Instead of consuming everything you can about get rich quick ideas, consume everything you can about the thing you picked. Become an expert.\n\n3. Find a way to start inexpensively. Businesses are generally set up as fixed cost or variable cost. A fixed cost business has expenses every month regardless of what your revenue is. Rent, employee salaries, insurance, etc. A variable cost business generally has costs associated with revenue. If you‚Äôre a reseller‚Ä¶you get orders for a product, collect payment, and then get the product and ship it. Without the order, you had none of those costs. When you are just starting out, try to donut the variable cost way so that you can test the concept without going broke.\n\n3. It won‚Äôt be passive. So find the right Sub to join to talk about working for yourself. Sidehustles or entrepreneur is more appropriate.\n\n4. Starting a business is almost like having a kid. It requires a lot of time, and effort. It‚Äôs not easy, but it can be very rewarding at the same time. But you are committing a significant portion of your time (now and in the future) which comes with sacrifices. \n\n5. Get excited! Because passive income IS possible. It just requires time/effort to build.\n\nGood luck!",

Most poor people get stuck in the same cycle of \"Need money, must get job\", so they apply for jobs where other people tell them what to do. Nothing wrong with that if you are satisfied living paycheck to paycheck your whole life.\n\nSuccessful people, on the other hand, see opportunities all  around them. Making money is easy for them, as even the failures are a lesson to learn from, because they don't NEED the money, so they can take on more risks to earn more than a poor person could afford to do. We've all read the stories of rich people losing millions overnight due to stocks dropping or crypto, and they shrug it off and move on.\n\nI was that poor person many years ago, working a shitty, dead end job, but I observed how rich people acted. They took risks and didn't give a shit. Once I changed my mindset from poor person to rich person, even when not rich yet at the time, it was a lightbulb in my head.\n\nNow I actually enjoy thinking up income streams and I earn enough that I'm not afraid to take risks. Making money is EASY, but changing your mindset to get there is the hardest part. Nail that and you WILL be successful.",

Just learn the basics, pick a product, and get it listed.\n\nFor long-term financial growth, start investing in index funds.

I have a lot of free time and tried everything I could online to turn minutes into dollars, this is the best thing I've found thats worth your time!\n\nWhen companies create / alter product lines.. they want to get a feel for how to general market will enjoy/dislike the product. Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often.

I‚Äôve been seriously thinking about relocating to Europe possibly Barcelona or Porto and living a more carefree lifestyle. Before making the move, I want to understand realistically how much passive income would be ‚Äúenough‚Äù to live comfortably without stressing about monthly bills.\n\nHere‚Äôs my current financial situation in detail:\n\n*  **Passive income:** $600 + $300 + $200 = **$1,100/month** from three fully paid-off apartments I rent out.\n* **Mortgage:** $2,000/month total for two other apartments.\n   * One of them still has **$80,000** remaining (out of $113,000). I‚Äôve already paid $33,000 on it.\n   * The other is still being built ‚Äî still has **$53,000**  (remaining out of $89,000). I‚Äôve already invested **$36,000**. If I decide to sell this unit, I can get that $36,000 back immediately.\n* **Deposit:** $25,000 personal Deposit.\n* **Total remaining real estate debt:** $80,000 + $53,000.\n* **Income:** Including salary and passive income, I make around **$10,000/month**.\n* If I move, I plan to rent out the apartment I currently live in for an extra **$500‚Äì600/month** at least (That's the one is **$80,000** mortgage).\n\nI want to know:\n\n1. How much **passive income** would you personally consider ‚Äúenough‚Äù to live a stress-free life in Europe (mainly Barcelona or Porto)?\n2. Would it make sense to **sell the under-construction apartment** and use that money toward covering my $80K mortgage and use $25K deposit also before moving?\n3. Or should I wait a bit longer, build more cushion, and then make the move? If so, till when is reasonable to wait. I'm not young, either old, I know, however time flies and that fears me.\n\nMy goal isn‚Äôt to live luxuriously ‚Äî just comfortably, without financial anxiety. Any advice, especially from those who‚Äôve relocated to Europe or live on passive income, would be super appreciated",

She was smart about finances, and knew how to suck money out of men. (Don't ask me how I know.)\n\nYour freedom number is how much income per month you need to be free - or do what you're trying to do - retire in Europe... or at least, go on a long-term sabbatical in Europe.\n\nHer number was $4,000.00 - she was able to live a reasonably modest life in Europe. She traveled to an inexpensive location in Italy - near San Remo. It used to be a popular resort area before air travel became cheap... say, prior to WWII. \n\nFrom there, you can have lunch in France and work on your Italian and French. It is very close to the French Riviera (easy drive to Nice, Cannes and Monaco, Monte Carlo...)\n\nShe was able to rent a cheap apartment - decent and not too fancy and live life.   \n  \nBut also to take into consideration what she doesn't tell people... she is VERY good looking and so probably got invited out a lot by men. She didn't tell me this, but you would have to assume this. \n\nSo it will depend upon your lifestyle. If you cook at home and buy groceries in local markets it will be very cheap. If you fancy sitting in a sidewalk cafe sipping esspressos in the morning and wine in the evening, it will add up to more.\n\nIf you eat in restaurants or plan on dating and are male... much more.",

You can stay for between 30-90 days depending on your country of origin.   \n\\- but then flights from there are very cheap. So you jump over to Thailand. They are having a tourism crisis, so there are deals on AirBnBs like crazy - you can fly there for $50 and it's also cheap to stay in Phuket or wherever.  \nThen jump over to Vietnam.  \nYou can stay in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City for $600/month. Eat delicious pho for $4, breakfast for $3\n\nBuy your tickets and bookings via [trip.com](http://trip.com) \\-- Waaaayyyy cheaper than Europe and just as cool.

Safety issues, leftist government, a ton of taxes spent on shit, high unemployment rate, etc. \n\nHowever, if you still want to live there (or Portugal, which is much nicer), \"enough\" depends entirely on what that concept means to you. 10k a month is a shitload of money that only 1% of the population in Spain earns, but that includes your salary. \n\nIf we're talking only about passive income, you can live a comfortable life with 2k a month. And yes, I said 2k a month even if most digital nomads will tell you they need 5k a month. Again, Spaniard here and I've lived in 4 countries. But this will vary based on your lifestyle. \n\nDo you plan on buying or renting in the new country? If you plan on renting, you can find apartments for 1 person in Barcelona for 1k and you would have 1k more for food, transportation, and going out. That's plenty enough. \n\nOn the other hand, if you're one of those who wants to eat out every single day, live in the most expensive areas in a penthouse on the 30th floor, buy expensive clothes, drive a fancy car, waste money on random women, you're a heavy smoker/drinker, etc. 2k won't be enough. \n\n\"Enough\" is a very broad and subjective term. I lived in the city center of Barcelona (Eixample neighborhood) for 1350 euros all-included. I'm talking rent, food, 1 motorbike, and going out with my friends. But going out meant normal restaurants, cinema or art exhibition. Didn't go to clubs, didn't waste money inviting random women at fancy restaurants, didn't buy designer clothes every month, etc. Also I don't drink alcohol, non-smoker, no money spent on drugs. It was enough for me :)",

      "selftext": "Hello, I received an email towards the end of September stating that I needed to take a qualification task for Project Sonic (similar to Project Coffee on Crowdgen - Multimango platform).\n\nI received a text reminding me to take the qualification task on October 3rd in order to gain access to the full project. I completed the qualification and received an email on October 8th about completing an identity verification process in order to stay on Project Sonic and receive pay.\n\nPoint is, I completed the qualification task and identity verification shortly after receiving said email.\n\nI never got an email confirming that I could start working on Project Sonic (it was mentioned in the qualification email that I would get a follow-up email indicating whether I passed or not). However, when I go to the Multimango platform and login using the provided credentials from TelusInternational, I can see tasks that are available to work on (again similar to Project Coffee on Crowdgen). Does this mean I could start working now? It'd really help considering Project Coffee has been paused for many users (including myself) while they undergo quality reviews.\n\nIf I can start working on the project, how exactly will I be paid? I don't think I was able to add any payment information on my TelusInternational account nor was I prompted to use any app.\n\nAny advice/help would be appreciated.",

Barely published anything.\n\nThen I tried just using Google autocomplete and related searches to find topics, validated maybe 3 keywords a day with a tool to make sure they weren't impossible, and started publishing. Traffic came faster with the second approach.\n\nYou don't need to know the exact CPC or SERP features or click-through rate for every keyword when you're starting out. You need to know if people search for it and if you have a shot at ranking. Pick something reasonable and publish.\n\nI use [keyspy.io](http://keyspy.io) now because it's $19/month and just shows difficulty and volume. Before that I was paying for Ahrefs and using about 5% of it. The expensive tools are built for agencies, not solo bloggers.\n\nGoogle Search Console becomes way more valuable once you have content anyway. It shows you what's actually working instead of what you think might work.\n\nAnyone else find they overthought this at the start?",

Kiddo is at the cusp of recollecting stuff so it's not completely for just them to have memories. While yours might not be,  it would be for you. I have been to over 65 countries and spouse has been to over 100 but most of those had been vacations and done at speed.  This time around though, the experience is very different due to slow traveling.  Priority is to balance seeing places, excercising, doing activities at home and outside with kiddo (extracurriculars included),  focusing on did etc. Really slowing it down for all of us so that we develop a sense of being present. In US, we are trained to always do something, we live to work. In France,  people work to live. We are focusing on regulating our nervous systems and bodies. You mentioned in one comment that you were unable to turn off stress even when not handling the day today of the business. You need to regulate as well in that case. We choose countries where we think we might live longer term in the future. \n\nWe are finding it delightful.",

It felt like a loss at the time but that imbalance of power never leads to good business. With hindsight, I'd probably try to introduce premiums for specific bad behaviour (e.g. last minute request fee) and stick to them religiously. Then if the customer leaves, they leave. If they stay they'll be incentivised to behave better, and who knows, maybe they will (if not you can keep increasing those premiums). I think the scenario where they accept the blanket price increase but continue behaving badly doesn't do enough to fix the issue - they'll still make your life hell.",

Use the current client as reference (with their ok) or just mention it in passing in person if not. \n\nAfter this period of grind, the aim would be to have at least 3 smaller clients to make up a good bunch of what you are losing from the big one.  Going forward then try devote half a day each week if possible to marketing so you end up with no one client being more than 15% of your income.

It‚Äôs 2AM, the house is silent, and you‚Äôre tweaking a landing page that no one‚Äôs going to see for weeks. You start questioning everything. Last week I was deep in that spiral and ended up jumping on jackpot city streams just to hear people talk about literally anything else. Random chatter, dumb jokes it pulled me out of my own head for a while.  \nI love building, but yeah, it‚Äôs lonely as hell sometimes. How do you stay sane during the grind?",

I started tracking what sold best, improving my listing descriptions , and focusing more on things like PC laptops, video cards, and even men‚Äôs shoes.  \n  \nOnce I found what was working the income became steady. It now brings in around $3k a month which still amazes me considering how it all started.

I hired a guy that intentionally told me he was the general manager of a small company, and said he \"knew the owners and might be able to connect us for some work\". Then when I brought him on he let it out that it was actually a failed business that he had started and ran. I let him go immediately for the lack of integrity (he also claimed qualifications he did not have). Honesty is the best policy in my opinion. I don't know what you do or what your company was, but if you are thoughtful about how you frame it I guarantee there is a positive spin in there somewhere for you.",

Chatgpt a half sales pitch half job request email and send it to preferbly the owner of the business. They actually have a profit motive to hire talent. Send email then follow with a call. Hit em with your pitch and include your relavent experince and ability to execute on a level unmatched by the rest of their team proven by income through your own business. Be a \"disruptor.\" Use hackenyed business non-fiction phrases like that in your pitch. Think Sun tzu, 7 habits, getting to yes, Kizen etc that will be relatable. If they then ask for a resume afterwards use your one kernel of relevant experience and make up some awesome sounding bullshit from businesses that you worked for that are now sold/bankrupt. (check venture cap failure rates and business succes rates to know how large a pool this is to play in.) Have your one good reference from the job and then two professional sounding friends confirm your bullshit. Its not flawless but damn is it effective. Way better success rate then the path set out for the chimps. I can usually get a above avg salary in my desired field in 3-4 calls. Don't really have to do it often as I can back up my bs with talent in the field and will do my own research to fill in any holes I have. Feel free to read Musk's Bio and The Snowball to understand the caliber of people who do this that I'm cribbing from.",

I keep reminding myself why I am building my start-up. At this point, getting a 'good exit' is not even at the top of the list (although that would be nice!). I have started this to solve a problem and need to see it through.\n\n2.  See if you can build a 'support system' - I have a buddy who is also going through a similar journey and we have agreed to keep talking to each other about our pain points. \n\n3. Listen to your body - at least as a solopreneur, I have some degree of freedom with my schedule. I usually listen to  energetic music when i work or go workout, shower, etc. when I need a break. Sometimes I even take a nap in the middle of the day and then slog it out late in the night. The key is to understand what keeps you in your productive zone most of the time and try to do more of that. High Productivity/Passion =&gt; Less Stress.\n\n4. Have something that you can look forward to. For me, I keep (kept? - more below) my Friday evenings to just unwind with my favorite food and drink. I'm back at it first thing Saturday morning, but Friday evening is my time. Through out the week, I imagine myself sitting on the couch on Friday evening and ask myself 'what do I need to accomplish before Friday, that will help me enjoy it more?' and the work towards that.\n\n5. Go Public! Recently, I went public with my startup on LinkedIn (nerve wracking, yes), but that is driving a new level of accountability that I don't even want to do my Friday ritual anymore (LOL). It is not just the fear of public failure, but also the motivation from listening to people's problems and how I am working to solve those.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nPS: Yes, I have read Tim Ferris' \"4-Hour Work Week\", but haven't truly figured out how to make it work for my situation.",

That said, I have received several great inquiries, ones definitely worth attention, for senior roles, mid-level positions, and personal brand management.\n\nI just write about what interests me. My topics depend on that. If my interests change, maybe my ‚Äústrategy‚Äù will too. Probably more about work, since now I have one.\n\nDid I find a job? I did. I‚Äôm not sure LinkedIn directly helped, but thanks to it, I‚Äôve had side gigs that have totaled about $1,000. That wasn‚Äôt my goal, though.\n\nI didn‚Äôt expect such rapid growth or to reach such high numbers. So far, I‚Äôm satisfied :)\n\nI‚Äôve garnered 3.6 million impressions, gained over 7,000 followers, and written 270 posts, averaging 128 reactions and 30 comments.\n\nOverall impression, I like it.

You cracked it accidentally: writing without strategy forces authenticity, which triggers LinkedIn's engagement algo because real opinions spark debate. The $1K in side gigs is the weak signal everyone ignores. Those aren't random offers. They're trust conversions from lurkers who watched your consistency for months. Your real asset isn't 7K followers. It's the invisible attention inventory you've built with champions who haven't DM'd yet. That converts at 10x when you actually need something.

      "selftext": "\nWhen I first started buying companies, I didn‚Äôt have investors, fancy financing, or any kind of silver spoon. What I did have was time, curiosity, and a willingness to talk to business owners who wanted to retire. Over time I figured out that most people selling good companies don‚Äôt care about finding the highest bidder. They care about finding someone who will take care of what they built. That shift in thinking is what made everything possible.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned from actually buying businesses with limited capital in 2025.\n\nI look for companies that are simple and steady. No hype. No startups(unless we think we can make something work with the existing owner staying on full time). I like plumbing, concrete, restoration, logistics, small manufacturing, marketing agencies with retainers, and local service companies that people rely on every week. They‚Äôre not glamorous, but they make consistent money and they‚Äôve usually been run by the same person for twenty or thirty years. Those owners are tired. They want to slow down, but they also want to know their employees and customers will be taken care of.\n\nI build my own list. I pick an industry, use Google Maps, and write down every company that looks active. Then I just reach out. I‚Äôll call or email the owner and say something like, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôve followed your business for a while and really respect what you‚Äôve built. I own and operate a couple small companies and was wondering if you‚Äôve ever thought about stepping back or bringing someone on to help with the next stage.‚Äù That‚Äôs it. No big sales pitch. Just a human conversation.\n\nMost people say no the first time and second time. Some never call back. But a few will talk. And those few conversations are where all the good deals come from. I keep track of everyone I contact and follow up every few months. Timing is everything.\n\nOnce a conversation turns serious, structure matters more than anything. I‚Äôve used seller financing in nearly every deal I‚Äôve done. One deal went like this: $1 million purchase price, $100k down, $500k SBA loan, and the seller carried $400k at five percent interest for five years. They liked the idea of getting paid over time instead of walking away. It gave me enough breathing room to run the business right.\n\nIf I don‚Äôt have the down payment, I find a partner who‚Äôs comfortable lending it in exchange for interest or a small profit share. I keep control by structuring it as a loan, not equity. That kind of creativity gets deals done without losing ownership. That said I always want an active partner. No passive guys - not worth the headache. \n\nI always talk to banks before I need them. I‚Äôll call local SBA lenders and ask what they like to see from borrowers. They‚Äôll tell you exactly how they think. That‚Äôs free education. When you finally bring them a real opportunity, you already know how to package it so they can say yes. Also keep in mind some of the local banks aren‚Äôt really SBA. \n\nDue diligence is where most buyers get lazy. I don‚Äôt. I ask for tax returns, bank statements, vendor lists, customer breakdowns, and payroll reports. I compare deposits to income. I verify that employees are real and staying on. I want no surprises after closing.\n\nWhen I negotiate, I care more about structure than price. I‚Äôll ask for a few months of interest-only payments or a transition period where the seller helps part-time. Those little details protect cash flow while you learn. Sellers usually say yes because it helps everyone succeed.\n\nIf you want to get started, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do right now.\n\nWeek 1: pick one or two industries you understand. Build a list of 25 businesses in your area.\nWeek 2: call or email 10 owners. Get two real conversations.\nWeek 3: ask one of them for basic financials. Build a rough deal model just to practice.\nWeek 4: talk to one SBA lender and ask what it would take to fund a deal like that.\n\nThen repeat the cycle every month. If you stay consistent for 90 days, you‚Äôll have real leads, real numbers, and one or two sellers who are thinking about it.\n\nBuying a business with limited capital isn‚Äôt magic. It‚Äôs process, patience, and communication. The 2025 market is full of retiring owners who want someone capable to take over. If you can listen, plan, and follow through, you can become that person.\n\nIf anyone wants to talk through how to start, how to reach out to sellers, or what to look for in a deal, drop your questions. I‚Äôm happy to share what‚Äôs worked for me.\n\nDr Connor Robertson",

I have started and lost businesses, had marketplace accounts shut down, and poured a year into a project that failed, and that cycle taught me to favor steady, repeatable systems over chasing quick wins. I also spent years bouncing between ideas, battled binge drinking, and have been maintaining sobriety while rebuilding focus, so I know how clarity and structure feel when they finally click. I once found purpose again coaching kids, and that piece of meaning helped me steady my next moves. I share that because your approach of listening to retiring owners and valuing structure resonates with how I rebuilt my work life. \n\nHere are simple, concrete steps you can use right away: start by building a local list of 25 businesses and use a short, human outreach script to get two real conversations this month, talk to at least one lender now to learn what documents they need so you can model a clean deal later, insist on seller financing or convert a partner contribution into a loan so you keep control while preserving cash flow, and create a due diligence checklist to verify payroll, deposits, and customer concentration before you sign. Keep notes, follow up every 90 days, and protect a short transition period with interest only payments while you learn the business. I admire your patience and the listening mindset you described, and if you want to run a real outreach script or a deal model together I am happy to help. Small consistent actions win. \n\nAustin Erkl - Entrepreneur Coach",

I‚Äôd also request to know immediately what else is faked because you cannot afford the ramifications from any other fake work unless you know about it and can start containing or mitigating the impact. Depending on what you find, there could be a risk of customer loss or worse litigation.\n\nOnce that is out of the way, you should decide if you want to let them work towards rebuilding trust. IMO it must NOT be a simple just trust them but rather they‚Äôd need to agree to not represent artificial data as real and work under additional scrutiny into their output which you can slowly reduce as trust is rebuilt. This is not just for the benefit of knowing if they are trustworthy but also to really drive home the point on how sacred trust is.",

Etc.\n\nThe client is super happy with it, and they use it daily.\n\nAnswering your question.. the right keyword to look for \"Speaker Diarization\" platforms that will convert Speech-to-text with speakers' detection technology.\n\nGood luck.",

I would recommend no to stage the event around a party or drinks. You can give them under a very control system like one drink like a beer for every person. No hard drinks and please set a reasonable ending time. Lite 6 o 7 pm. After that if the people want to go out or go into a party its going to be their responsibility of course outside of the office. \n\nCheers and good luck",

The more frequent the problem the better. As Alex Hormozi says look for pain that happens every day or every week not once a year. That way your business lives in people‚Äôs day to day life not their once a year wish list.\n\nJeff Bezos used to say build around things that never change. People will always want convenience trust good service and something that saves them time or makes them feel good. When you build for what stays true you don‚Äôt need to chase trends. Build around those timeless needs instead of chasing trends.\n\nAnd because you‚Äôre introverted we already have the patience to think deeply and build quietly. That‚Äôs a strength. We don‚Äôt need to shout just solve something meaningful and let your work speak. We just need to help a few people really well.\n\nStart small. Observe deeply. Build patiently.

A rich couple walking their dog walked up to the while he and I were working on something and asked what we did at the building. My father asked rudely, \"What do you want?\" \n\nThey got the message and walked away. My father was an alcoholic and could be an asshole. I remember feeling embarrassed for his behavior that day. Later in life, I understood better why he ran them off. \n\nHe was a chemical engineer and a lawyer that was too belligerent to be employed by anyone so he was a contractor all his life. His main passion in life was fishing, hunting, and going to the bar to meet his friends, all while drinking of course. \n\nWhat I later figured out is if he gets friendly with the rich couple then maybe they want to borrow tools, ask engineering or legal questions, or inquire about his occupancy permit which he did not have. There's a whole host of possibilities and he already had all the friends that he wanted. The couple had nothing to offer that interested him and was a potential pain in the ass. \n\nHis boundaries and communication skills were atrocious but walking up to non-public warehouse with no sign and asking questions is a good way to be told to tuck off. \n\nI'm far more polite than my father but I've learngymed not to get too friendly, too fast with anyone. Unfortunately, friendly people often end up being a problem and they were being nice to get something or have some type of drama. \n\nNow, I'm the cynical old man and if7 I'm approached in public, the first thing out my mouth is, \"What do you want?\" The next thing is, \"I'm not interested.\" If they still want to talk to me, \"Is this an emergency? Should I call 911?\" It's always no so, \"If it's not an emergency then I don't have time.\" It's the same script every time. \n\nI've learned to keep it short and sweet with my neighbors as well. They have stepped over the line enough that I don't want the hassle. Some of the people with the most integrity and decency that I have met in life were not initially that friendly. I had to earn their trust and respect.",

I am at 9 months about to launch within the next 4 weeks (will not promote, just shedding light on reality). Took so much perseverance, dedication, and patience. Clocked over 8-9 hours a day on average coding everyday. It's not an AI wrapper but still, I feel like so many people underestimate how long a real project takes. For those in the same shoes, don't give up! These stories used to downplay my progress but the reality is this: it takes a long time for something great and useful. Keep grinding and create amazing things! AI has been a huge help but no way in hell could you vibe code or start a big project to launch ready in such short time.\n\nEdit: I do have 3.5 years of experience in creating full stack applications. I have built apps that still currently have many hundreds of daily active users. I have validated my current idea directly through people and groups and have listened to competitor's negative reviews and feedback. These things are risks but I have calculated that this is worth the risk! Thank you for your support and concerns !",

I'm asking because I'm learning this as I go. In my roadmap, launching will take me around other 3 or 4 weeks. So, it's not just a one-click action.  \nMy understanding is that you need to start talking about your product in many places, start answering questions, dealing with feedback, and once you have some momentum, keep it.\n\nNow, like other people share in their comments, a first launch shouldn't take too much, the product should not be perfect. Rather, it should prove the point of solving a problem in a specific way. If people want it even if it looks ugly and fails, you got product-market fit. It must be cheap in the beginning.\n\nDo you have a different understanding of how to launch a product? I'd like to hear from you.",

In fact, [RedwoodSDK](https://rwsdk.com/) is currently in beta on their v1, and makes it REALLY easy to integrate with Cloudflare. Cloudflare is very powerful, but also a pain in the ass to work with when doing non-standard stuff (Vercel is probably going to be the same in all honesty).\n\nFrom personal anecdotal experience, I have [Omae3](https://oma3.vercel.app/) which is a character generator for an RPG called Shadowrun. It's running on Vercel, and I'm too cheap to pay for it. The code for it lives on [github](https://github.com/HeyOmae/OMA3) and the integration was extremely easy to set up. I had to jump through some hoops and set up the deploy on a personal repo, but that's once again, because I'm cheap and don't want to pay them. They also had some very nice metrics until I hit their cap and had to pay them. Which, if this was a business, I'd pay for, but it's a hobby app, that I'm building for the community and I don't give a shit about making money with, so I opted out.\n\nNow, with Cloudflare, I'm hosting 2 static sites ([test2doc.com](https://test2doc.com/) and [dethstrobe.com](https://dethstrobe.com/)) and these were trivial to set up and make integrations with. Which, makes sense, because Cloudflare is a CDN, static resources is kind of their bag.\n\nRedwoodSDK has been interesting, I've worked through their tutorial, which gives a nice CRUD app to build out and use some of Cloudflare's cool tech like durable objects to persist data. And it's very easy to use, but I have ran in to a few small bugs while working locally that forced me to nuke the DB and rebuild and rerun migrations and seeds. It's quick to get back to working state, but I do have some concerns that might be more edge cases since it is so new. But I personally don't mind bleeding a bit while being on the cutting edge.\n\nI guess it depends on how much money you have vs how much tolerance for putting up with integration friction. If you're cheap and don't mind a bit of pain, cloudflare. If you don't mind burning money, but want an easier time vercel.\n\nAlso, just to throw out a few other alternatives. [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is really easy to work with and cheap. I've heard good things about [fly.io](http://fly.io), but I haven't tried them yet. [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) is fantastic and cheap, but you have to set up everything yourself. And of course, there is always the big players like AWS, gCloud, and Azure. But I think big tech is actually a big pain in the ass, honestly not as cheap as the smaller player.",

Standard stuff like lawn maintenance, seasonal cleanups, mulching, the usual.\n\nAbout 8 months ago I had this one client who kept asking if I could pressure wash their driveway while I was already there doing their yard. I said sure whatever, charged them like $75 extra just to not deal with scheduling another visit. Took me maybe 30 mins.\n\nWord got around I guess because then other clients started asking. I figured why not, easy add on right? Fast forward to now and I'm getting calls specifically for pressure washing. Like people don't even want the landscaping part anymore they just want their driveways, decks, house siding done.\n\nDid the math last week and the pressure washing stuff brought in almost double what the landscaping did last month. I've got some money saved up from the busy season and St–∞ke so I could buy better equipment and actually pivot to this full time but it feels weird abandoning what I started with?\n\nAnyone else deal with something like this where a side thing accidentally became the main thing?

Always be open to pivot to new opportunities. \n\nI built a multi million dollar business off of a similar scenario. \n\nI had a customer about 15 years ago ask me to fix a device in their business that no one had ever repaired before. These were considered \"throw-away\" devices. They'd last maybe 5 years and then would break somehow and the business owner would have to buy a new one for anywhere from $5k - $12k depending on the brand because no one provided repair services.\n\nSo we offered to try and repair it. We did basically the same thing you did, $100 and we'll try to repair it. We were successful. I wrote a blog post about it on our company website and within a week we started getting calls about the service. It was crazy. We started receiving 10+ calls per day about this service. We completely pivoted our focus to only this service.\n\nTo find our pricing we simply kept on increasing prices until people started pushing back.  So now we charge about $1,200 for a service that costs us a couple hundred to provide.\n\nNow we're nationwide and Repair about 10,000 of these devices per year and growing.

      "selftext": "I run a small alterations shop in Austin and honestly I dont know why I waited this long to do this. For three years I kept walk in hours because I thought thats what customers wanted and I was terrified of losing business.\n\nThe reality was way different tho. Id have people walk in right when Im in the middle of a hem on a wedding dress, or Id block out time to finish rush orders and then spend 45 minutes with someone who just wanted to ask if I could fix their jacket zipper (which I dont even do). My actual turnaround times were getting worse because I couldnt focus.\n\nI spent like two months researching what other alterations places were doing, talked to my regular customers, even checked polymarket to see what the recession odds were since I was worried people would stop spending on alterations if the economy tanked. But mostly I just tracked my own numbers for a month and realized that 60% of walk ins either didnt book anything or wanted services I dont offer.\n\nMade the switch to appointment only in September. Put up signs, updated my google business, sent emails to my regular clients. First week I was stressed as hell thinking my phone would stop ringing.\n\nOpposite happened. My schedule is actually FULLER now because people book in advance and I can plan my day properly. Im finishing work faster, taking on more jobs, and honestly my stress levels dropped like crazy. Plus the clients who book appointments tend to be more serious and respectful of my time.\n\nOnly downside is I do get the occasional person who shows up anyway and gets annoyed when I cant help them right then. But honestly thats on them for not reading the giant sign on my door lol\n\nIf youre on the fence about this just do it. Track your numbers first so you know what youre actually dealing with but dont wait as long as I did.",

Nights/weekends/holidays? That guy gets OT and so should you. \n\nTwo boxes of late receipts‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwell, we won‚Äôt be able to get this filed on time.‚Äù Add a late rush fee on the bill. \n\nWon‚Äôt get you ban statements for reconciliation in time? Use that time to find new clients. When they bring it late, do it at your normal pace. You‚Äôre training your client at the same time, so I wouldn‚Äôt flip around the first time and drag feet. Start gradually slowing down to a normal pace. His failure to meet your deadline doesn‚Äôt mean you should be bending over backwards now to meet his. \n\nFamily business is a tax office/business consulting firm, doing accounting and payroll. We tell folks to have docs in 5 days before an IRS deadline or it‚Äôs an automatic extension or late filing. If they get the documents in after our deadline, we do the extension and then do the tax return the week after the deadline. We can‚Äôt do ‚Äúlast minute‚Äù work for every client. \n\nNow, doing payroll and bookkeeping/accounting has generally helped tremendously. I‚Äôve got access to a bunch of their tax documents ahead of time and now don‚Äôt have to wait for their P+L, W2, whatever. Firm is up to ~250 clients, 40% of that growth over the last two years. Remember, CPA‚Äôs are aging out and retiring, while new grads aren‚Äôt meeting those numbers. BLS estimates ~110-120k retiring and 30-40k entering. Finding new clients will be super easy. Tell your existing clients they‚Äôll get 10% off if they bring you a new client. We only take referrals, zero advertising. \n\nThe other thing that‚Äôs been a huge help is doing the business consulting piece and helping people do their AOI, EIN, 2553, etc filings. We now have a client from the start, set them up on QB, price out basic bookkeeping services at $75/month, and we tell them to let us know when they‚Äôre ready for payroll. They now bring us their business tax return, personal tax return, parent/sibling/neighbor tax return, then these new business owners go to some networking event to push their business and tell the other new business owner about how our service got them up and running inside of two weeks. Now we get another phone call and help close out the other business owner‚Äôs 2553, QB setup, then get their business tax return, personal tax return, sibling‚Äôs tax return‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs quite easy.\n\nDM if you‚Äôd like.

She said ‚Äú$50 for 12 cupcakes?!‚Äù My face turned bright red and I was like ‚Äúum yeah‚Ä¶ if you want I can do toppers rather than a custom design and lower the price.‚Äù And then she was like ‚Äúno, I want to showcase your design so it‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll pay the full amount‚Äù as if she is doing me a favor‚Ä¶ \n\nI‚Äôm guessing this is a common experience for small business owners.

Over the past few years, we have had families bring elderly relatives - people in their 80s and 90s, some with very frail bones or broken hips. This is extremely dangerous as they cannot easily get on/off the horse. Some of them are so immobile they cannot even walk from their cars to our staging area let alone get on a horse.\n\nToday we had an elderly fall off the horse and smash her head open.\n\nI want to be able to legally refuse service to people in such a condition. Here is the problem, federal law (Age Discrimination Act of 1975) does not permit us to discriminate based on age or disability. So we are in a gray area here.\n\nI do not want elderly people who are physically immobile to use our service and if they show up I want to be able to legally deny them, but I do not want to violate federal discrimination laws (such as Age Discrimination Act of 1975) and get sued. Are there any out clauses in the law that we can use for denying service based on it being say \"a risk to that person's safety\" or something? Of course I don't know if we are subject to federal age discrimination laws as we are a private company and do not receive federal funding.\n\nDoes anyone know a way around this. I'm thinking if we make a 'safety and risk' policy for ALL customers instead of just elderly that would work. Any info would be appreciated.\n\n  \nWe do have liability waivers customers sign but I still do not want people getting injured.",

Mount a TV in the tack room, add a few chairs and play Seabiscuit on a loop. Psychologically no one wants Agnes on the horse they just don't want her sitting in a hot car while they have fun.

          "body": "Here's what I would do (with the usual reddit disclosure that I'm not a lawyer).\n\nSend the client a letter stating your intention to request a civil judgment for the unpaid invoice amount. Hopefully that kickstarts their ass into gear and they just pay it to keep it from going any further. But if they continue to ignore it or delay payment, file a lawsuit. It's relatively inexpensive and easy if you do it yourself. And then, again, hopefully *that* kickstarts their ass into gear and they just pay it or offer to settle to keep it from escalating to court. If they still won't pay, then it's time to go to court, and for that you need an actual lawyer. You could try to represent yourself but generally that's not a great idea, but if you do hire a lawyer you should know you're probably going to pay as much (if not more) than you recover from the client. If you try to represent yourself, you could potentially recover a lot more of the money for yourself but you're also more likely to lose.\n\nThey probably have limited cash with which to pay their vendors right now. The squeakiest wheel gets the grease first, and right now you're not one of their squeakiest wheels. In other words, they're only paying the bills that are causing them the biggest problems right now. And you're not one of them. So if you want to get your money, you have to make your bill one of the ones that's causing them the most problems.",

I would not be inclined to go the legal route without one.\n\n1.  Does the contract say anything about recovering attorney's fees?  If Yes, then send a demand letter, reference that section in the contract and make it clear that on mm/dd/yyyy this matter is getting turned over to your attorney and the legal fees that \"YOU Mr. Client will be responsible for,\" start adding up.  If No, then now is the time to add that language to your contracts going forward.  I would still send the demand letter and note that you will be seeking attorney's fees, just be a little less specific about the details.  Whether or not you actually CAN recover such costs at the end of the day is a question for your attorney.\n\n2.  Does the client have assets?  Can they be made to pay up if you win?  Only $14k, I would expect so, but if not, it might not be worth the bother because you could get a settlement and not be able to collect anything.  If Yes to both 1 and 2, then hand it off to an attorney to go after them for the $14k plus costs.  If No to 1, but Yes, to 2, then you just gotta make a judgement call.  I'd figure legal expenses would be $5k minimum if it ends up actually going to court.  You could probably get away with less if a lawyer's demand letter or the court filing itself is enough to get them to pay up.  I think it's worth doing, but you have to understand that you might be throwing good money after bad.  Court is always an expensive gamble.\n\nMost deadbeats will pay up once you actually file in court.  Some will just ignore it, never respond, and never show up at court.  Still others will fight you to the absolute bitter end even if they have little hope of victory.  A-holes gonna A-hole.",

You can appeal and wait 30 days.‚Äù\n\nNo reason given.\n\nNo summary of their decision.\n\nNo timeline to recover my funds.\n\nResult:\n\n\\- ‚Ç¨50,000 frozen\n\n\\- Business operations halted\n\n\\- Dozens of detailed emails ignored, no clear response\n\n\\- My opinion after this experience\n\nWise is no longer a reliable solution for professionals.\n\nThey act like a bank ‚Äî but without transparency, accountability, or logic.\n\nTheir compliance team feels robotic, demanding contradictory and absurd documents, often impossible for small businesses to provide.\n\nAnd the worst part: they can shut down your account without warning, even if your file is clean.\n\nHonestly, it‚Äôs shameful.\n\nI regret ever trusting them.\n\nIf your business relies on Wise ‚Äî withdraw your funds while you still can.\n\n‚ùìQuestions for the community\n\nHas anyone else here had their Wise account closed with money stuck inside?\n\nHow long did it take before you got your funds back?",

Banks don't have transparency, accountability or logic either. My business has been arbitrarily de-banked twice, with no reason given. If you could respond by starting your own bank, maybe you could justify it by saying you can always start your own. But in Canada, you can't just start a bank, they keep it a closed industry. Which should mean laws to prevent them from abusing their power.",

Having the ability to separate everything into its own bucket and attach different access levels to different employees can help from an organizational standpoint.  \n  \nI work for Bluevine, and I know that you can view everyone's transactions from one dashboard, set spend limits, and (coming soon) link cards to specific sub-accounts, which can help more clearly separate finances and therefore make them a little easier to keep track of! There's always a little bit of chaos in running a business, but our goal is to help minimize that for you with financial tools built especially for small business.",

All charges go on the card so they're tracked.\n\nHotels, flights, cars are easily tracked because you have to use a certain system to book them.\n\nThen you're given per diem each day to use on whatever you want and don't have to provide receipts. People would pull the money out of the atm so the gov couldn't see what they were doing. Hookers and blow lol.\n\nNo liquor can be bought on the gov card. That is either the cash you pulled out or on your own. I remember buying liquor in for big tech though with no issue.\n\nYou had like 3 days to upload receipts otherwise YOU pay the bill. Also the cards are on YOUR credit report. It was definitely fucked in the gov because sometimes people had to pay the bill before getting reimbursed on the bill because the gov is so slow.\n\nMaybe go that route so it doesn't have to be tracked as much.",

Some of us are pest also. \n\nThe economy is still growing this year, less than last year, but it's not like we're in a recession. First and foremost, I would look inwards to see what the problem is.

      "selftext": "Have you ever had to end a collaboration with someone you genuinely liked working with?\n\nRecently, my business partner and I had to make that call with a freelance developer we both appreciated a lot. He wasn‚Äôt lazy or unskilled. At the beginning he was one of the most reliable people on the team. But over time something shifted. Tasks took longer, communication became distant, and it started to feel like he was working just to fill hours instead of driving things forward.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt dramatic or toxic, just that slow fade where motivation disappears. We tried to talk things through, but nothing really changed. In the end, keeping him on didn‚Äôt feel fair to him or to us.\n\nWhat surprised me most was how heavy it felt afterward. I actually liked the guy, and I kept wondering if I could have done more to help him reconnect. The next day, I spoke with another developer who has been working with us for a while, consistent, reliable, never any drama. I took a moment to thank her for her work, and she seemed genuinely touched.\n\nIt made me realize how often we forget to appreciate the people who quietly do things right until something goes wrong somewhere else.\n\nHave you been through something similar in your business? How did you handle it on your side?",

They don't, and won't, and it's crazy to expect otherwise. No one will ever give a shit about your business as much as the owners of the business, and you can't ever expect them to.\n\nSounds like you let a good relationship end because you couldn't set proper terms.\n\nedit: also generally speaking, sometimes employees are overambitious early on, think of it as the \"honeymoon stage\", they might feel like they have something to prove, or be all starry-eyed, and reality is that it can just fade over time, especially if their expectations are not in line with reality, if they had high hopes for things, and eventually realize that reality is not as glamorous or exciting as they imagined. We all like to gas ourselves up like we're great employers, but sometimes employees also feel undercompensated (and sometimes are actually undercompensated relative to the market) and that's something else that can disillusion them. So it's completely normal to see an employee who was once a star, eventually fade into \"just average\" over time. It sucks but it's normal.",

What began as freelancing for a couple of clients slowly turned into a real operation now we‚Äôve got steady work, a few part-time contractors and things are finally stable. Lately my girlfriend‚Äôs been showing interest in joining me fulltime. She‚Äôs great with organization, social media strategy, and client communication basically all the things I struggle to stay consistent with. On paper it makes total sense, but I can‚Äôt help wondering how it might affect the relationship long-term. We get along really well, but mixing business and personal life can get tricky fast. If we argue about something work related, it could easily bleed into everything else.  \nFor those of you who‚Äôve brought your spouse or partner into your company how did you make it work? Did you formalize it with roles, ownership or just play it by ear?  \nAny lessons you wish you knew before doing it?",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I need some advice on what to do with my business since I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about this.\n\nCurrently I am 25yo and 2 years ago I started a digital marketing agency (June 2023). Mainly focused on web design then started expanding into other services as my clients started requesting (facebook ads, google, funnels, etc.) so I just turned into a full stack agency.\n\nFirst year was hell and really tough but I pushed through and started getting some clients on a recurring basis. Most of them still with me right now.\n\nPricing is different per client some pay 2k/mo while others pay 1.2k or 1.6k depending on the scope.\n\nUp until 5 months ago I was mostly doing everything myself and just recently got some people to help me out.\n\nI have a media buyer who I pay 1.2k/mo for 3 ad accounts he manages for me and a design agency I started paying 1.5k/mo to take over all the creative production and design for me.\n\nMinus other expenses to run the business it brings my profit to around 5k/mo and I feel thays pretty good considering I‚Äôve never seen that money before and I used to make less than 1,600 every month before this business.\n\nSorry about all the details but now to my actual question. I no longer feel the same drive that I used to have when I started my business. \n\nI remember putting in 12+ hours every single day and not being able to sleep because I had so many ideas I wanted to execute. Every day I would wake up excited to get to work. \n\nNow I have to force myself to work. Dealing with clients, messaging, revisions, out of scope requests, etc. is just irritating now. Every time I hear my phone ring with a whatsapp I feel some type of anger and frustration because It‚Äôs going to be some client asking for more things.\n\nAnd I get it sometimes it sucks and you do need to eat shit for a while but I no longer enjoy what I do.\n\nI started the business because I genuinely wanted to help these businesses but now I can‚Äôt find that passion or energy to work again. \n\nSo I‚Äôm wondering if I should eat shit a little longer and see if I can fix things. Maybe focus on systems and what I can do to actually go back to how I felt.\n\nOr if I should listen to this constant dialogue to just close everything down and start something else.\n\nAnd if I‚Äôm just whining too much and being a bitch just tell me straight up. I‚Äôm the type of person that prefers things straight up hahah so won‚Äôt hurt, it‚Äôs encouraged.\n\nIm curious what are any of your thoughts or ideas on what I could do? It would really help. Thank you for reading.\n",

Try to take a break soon, but not a total disconnect - unplug from the day to day \"tyranny of the urgent\" and spend some time mixed between relaxing and thinking about the things that got you excited in the first place. Catch up on YouTube videos etc whatever content in your niche that you watched when you were hungry early on. Reflect on how you've learned and grown, and rediscover what caught your interest in the first place. Come back with a refreshed perspective. \n\n2) no more WhatsApp. Force your clients to use a professional communication method like email, where things can be categorized, tagged, and prioritized instead of being on call without a salary \n\n3) think about whether your current tier of clients are the kind you want to work with long term. In my experience, the lower end of the market is where most of the needy, micromanaging clients are. If you've got the chops on the team to service upmarket clients, consider raising rates to price out some of the low end. You can take fewer clients for more money and less stress.",

I wouldn't say it's easier to start any other type of business, and it is especially hard to launch and grow a SaaS product. However, jobs tend to be pretty easy in my opinion, but the market is rough right now. I'd say to explore multiple options.",

Sharing so maybe someone else avoids this stuff.\n\nFirst mistake was thinking I could handle all the marketing myself. Spent 6 months posting on instagram and running terrible facebook ads. Burned through 15k with almost nothing to show for it. Finally hired someone who knew what they were doing and sales tripled in two months. I should have done that from day one but I was being cheap and thought I could learn it myself.\n\nSecond mistake was going with the cheapest manufacturer. Saved like 30 cents per unit but quality was garbage. Return rate was almost 15 percent and the negative reviews killed us. Took 8 months to recover our reputation after switching to a better supplier. That 30 cents ended up costing me probably 50k in lost sales and returns.\n\nThird one I just learned about this year. Got a legal letter about our website not being accessible to disabled people. Had no idea this was even a thing. The lawyer wanted 20k to settle and we had to scramble to actually fix the site. Apparently this happens to a lot of small ecommerce companies and nobody talks about it until it happens to them.\n\nEach of these felt like they came out of nowhere but looking back there were warning signs I just ignored. The manufacturer thing especially, I knew the quality wasn't great but kept making excuses.\n\nDoes anyone else have surprise expenses from stuff you didn't know you needed to worry about?",

Or how much you are a squad leader after playing CoD?\n\nTake for example [software.inc](http://software.inc) \\- pretty realistic in aspects and perspective, but cuts down the micro- and macro- management you'll need to do during all steps.\n\nAccounting is heavy in most business. It's actually the biggest pain point of any business. In the game it's literally few clicks and \"work on loan application\" &lt;- that loan application is a effing pita which might turn into several years if your books are crap.\n\nYou will have issues with inventory which any game won't show, for example it is easier to hold to old electronics I have instead of selling them off or throwing them out because they expired and if company throws them out then it is extra payment, if you sell it - it will take much more time to post it up and negotiate than you'll make back. Selling to liquidator is easier but you need bulk amount to make it viable financially. So you are stuck with old hardware for plenty of time. In the game you just upgrade it for the price of the new system which is not true in reality.\n\nI'm not even talking about HR or other things like working longer means better results - this is all false.\n\nThe very vital inventory is messed up by default in all games, you don't need to figure out location for everything based on size, material, usage rate etc.\n\nThen don't forget financials are always messed up in games - you have regulations, requirements etc.\n\nI like business games because they are very relaxing for me and easy, because everything is intuitive and straightforward.\n\nIRL you will be fumbled by how many layers there are to very simple things you'd never even think of.\n\nThat is why it is important to start trying business early in your lifetime - first and foremost is ability to zone-out into another charismatic person and talk to people, you'll get tired but you'll be selling to people. Thankfully mine is online only but if it happens offline I'm trying to be the most cheerful person out there (i have resting bitch-face by default though).",

You have one time expensive things (POS system, maybe), you have fixed recurring costs (like rent), you have cost of goods sold (what it costs to buy your inventory), and THEN you have some costs that actually depending on whether you are open that day, mostly wages.
