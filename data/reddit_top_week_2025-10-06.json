It honestly surprised me the first time I made a little money from one of them, since I never considered those skills worth much. Over time it added up, and that extra money plus a win on rollingriches even helped me buy my dream car something I never thought those small skills could lead to. Do any of you have side hustles where you‚Äôve managed to turn small or useless skills into actual income?",

      "selftext": "Those first couple of days on Etsy were rough. I had a shop set up, listings live, but the dashboard just sat there... no traffic, no favorites, no sales. I kept refreshing like a maniac, half-convinced nobody would ever find me.\n\nI didn‚Äôt bother wasting money on ads or trying to decode a bunch of SEO guides. Instead, I got curious and opened Twitter. Typed ‚ÄúEtsy‚Äù into search, switched to the Latest tab, and scrolled. Most of it was noise, but I started filtering for tweets that had 100+ reposts.\n\nThe thing that stood out? It wasn‚Äôt the big accounts going viral, they always do. It was the small ones. When someone with a couple thousand followers posted about a random Etsy product and it blew up, that meant the idea itself was hot.\n\nI caught one of those signals, pulled it up on HeyEtsy to see if people were actually buying, and sure enough the listings had fresh traffic. That was enough for me. I mocked up a quick version in Canva, listed it without overthinking, and walked away.\n\nTwo days later... cha-ching. My first sale. It didn‚Äôt make me rich, but it proved the shop wasn‚Äôt invisible. More than that, it showed me I didn‚Äôt have to sit around guessing products or wait forever for SEO to kick in.\n\nSince then, I‚Äôve kept the same little habit: spot what‚Äôs buzzing outside Etsy, double-check demand, and throw something up fast. Not perfect, but it works.\n\nAnyone else stumbled into their first sale in a weird way like this?",

I'd waste hours scrolling listings while other resellers grabbed everything first. Ended up using this search software called ubuyfirst (or else can't remember exactly). It's basically built for people buying inventory consistently on ebay which alerts you when new listings drop and organizes everything so you can make decisions way faster than the next buyer.  \n  \nFor vintage clothing I'd test ebay since the buyer pool is huge.

Food delivery apps (Uber Eats, DoorDash) you can start literally today if your car situation allows it. Taskrabbit for handyman stuff if you're even remotely handy. Facebook Marketplace flipping if you have any eye for underpriced items. Rover for dog walking if you're in a decent area for it. These aren't sexy but they pay within a week and require basically no ramp up time. If you've got any specific skills (design, writing, spreadsheets, whatever) Upwork and Fiverr are slow to start but can build up. I'd recommend stacking 2-3 of these so you're not dependent on one income stream.\n\nIf you're curious, I made this kinda fun tool called Cosmic Hustle (https://cosmic-hustle.vercel.app) that matches you to side hustle ideas based on your birth chart - it's just a fun way to brainstorm options you might vibe with and get some actual next steps. But honestly for immediate cash, the delivery/gig apps are your best bet while you're in application mode. They suck but they bridge the gap.",

So learn, and code an idea that solves a problem within an industry.  Sounds hard...it's not.  Also...aim low.  Meaning you're not looking to create the next Facebook...you're looking to solve one annoying problem at a time that a reasonable amount of people have.  You can find problems in ANY industry if you look for them.  The ceiling is through the roof, and you WILL have time.  I have a solid resume, 10+ years working with top Fortune 100 companies and I've been out of a job since December.  To be fair, I burnt out quick and said f\\*k it...allowed myself to think like a victim and took a few months off.  Now..I'm back on my grind and ai coding with no prior experience..it's fun and great upside.\n\nAlso..what I've learned to save you time.  \n\n1. Ghost posts: 40%+ of jobs are LIinkedIn are fake or you will never hear back.  I didn't believe this stat at first, now I'm convinced it's more like 65%.\n2. Fastest way to get a job = networking (no shocker, always has been..still is, now more than ever) Find someone you know at a company and check those opportunities first then ask if your poc can help you get your resume to recruiter. \n3. Second fastest way to get a job = be 1st apply.  Pay for job scrapers that feed you posted jobs within 30 minutes.  \"but hold up..that's excessive bro?  I'll just apply each day\".  Good luck!  Seriously, you'll need luck when your resume is submitted on top of 700 perfectly worded ai/chatgpt resumes hitting all buzzwords and perfectly ats formatted.  This ai era for job hunting is slicing both ways, equally bad for recruiters and candidates.  Recruiters can't respond to people now because they have to go through resumes that their software was supposed to filter, but now...they get hundreds every day, sometimes hour if it's good job.\n4. TAKE TIME FOR YOURSELF.  Remember, this is temporary, you'll figure it out...and then, you'll look back and say \"damn, I wish I enjoyed my free time a little more....why was I so stressed?\"  No income and steady bills is scary, I'm nervous as hell right now...but it's not lost on me I might never have my health (40 but fit and healthy) and this free time again.  So I wake up and do something fun each morning for 30 minutes.  You should too.  \n5. And lastly...everyone will have an opinion or judgement about why you haven't got a job in 17 business seconds.  they'll convince you \"companies aren't hiring\" or \"ai has taken everyone's job\" or you'll convince yourself \"maybe my resume isn't that good\".  Learn to block that out.  Your opinion is the only one that matters....sounds like a hallmark card..but I have had some tough calls from family..my father once telling me it's probable my inability to find a job is related to the layoff of my entire department including the president who was 2 levels above me.  It was purely financial, bc I knew the finances lol. I'd been there 14 years.  It's hard to shrug off everyone's worry, judgement, etc.  I hope none of this applies and you get a job in a few days.  But take from this what you need should it be longer.  You got this",

I feel like I‚Äôm someone who can comment on this as I‚Äôve been in a situation for the past 24 months of my life. \n\nI have had 2 jobs that I eneded up losing so in the past 2 years I‚Äôve been unemployed twice. \n\nFirst time was from January to October of 2024 and most recently May 2025 till now. \n\nThe good thing was I started building side hustles a long time ago and have always dabbled in them. \n\nSo what did I do? I started using AI to build anything possible in overdrive. \n\nI bought boilerplates to help with the code made products that people wanted and started working on them every second I had( I have 3 little kids 3 under 3. So my time was limited) \n\nIn those times I spent most of my time building ? When did I build? Between 9pm-2am or whenever I couldn‚Äôt keep my eyes open. \n\nEach day I built , marketed and kept going. I made decent money as well in total I made over 50k from my side hustles in the past year. \n\nMy problem wasn‚Äôt that I didn‚Äôt have ideas or built stuff people wanted it was I kept jumping ship. New product every few months people didn‚Äôt like that. \n\nThen this last month it all came to a halt. I was about to get kicked out of my house and I needed to sell it all. So I sold all of my things I built and everything I worked for for 13k to be able to live another 2 months of paying bills , health insurance etc. \n\nLooking back I wish I focused on one product and that‚Äôs it as my product would be better. \n\nIn terms of what works best that all depends. You can find freelancing work but nothing beats owning something yourself and with AI it has become easier. \n\nThe main thing and the easiest route is find a billion dollar company in a space you know or don‚Äôt know and pick 1 feature that they do. Build your own product around that one feature charge half the price and just focus on that. You‚Äôd be surprised how much you can make from it. \n\nYou can also start writing daily and publishing a daily newsletter etc as I think this will be great. I [write one myself](https://mattmerrick.com)\n\nYou can even make simple pdf or. A quick product on a topic you know and sell the pdf for $9 or whatever price you wish. \n\nCan do an Etsy shop etc really depends on you and your time. For me I‚Äôd just trying to build a micro SaaS that serves a market‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt have to be millions of people  even if it‚Äôs just 100 people you get at $9/month ads up. \n\nThe good thing is you are starting to think about this and just like me it can save you in the end.",

I‚Äôve seen people in this sub that have commutes that are two hours long set up the app to look for things along their path to and from work and then they just set up pick ups/drop offs along their commute and they make a couple hundred extra bucks every week pretty much just doing the same thing they‚Äôre already doing.\n\nThat‚Äôs how most of these big guys are flipping cars, couches, phones, and other types of stuff. They aren‚Äôt paying the normal prices that you see, they‚Äôre paying way less and they‚Äôre doing that by being the first one to go get these deals from these people that underprice them either because they don‚Äôt know the value, or don‚Äôt care about the value and just want it gone. \n\nMy advice would be just find something that you know a lot about, use the app to look for you, and just pick up the best deals and make sure that you‚Äôre the first message.

I live in a condo complex and theres this one lady who always complains at HOA meetings about how the flower beds look like crap and everyones patios have dead plants. Like she brings it up EVERY month without fail.\n\nAnyway last spring I was outside repotting some stuff on my balcony and she stopped to chat, basically went off about how nobody cares about the appearance of the building. I jokingly said \"pay me and ill fix it\" and she actually said ok lol\n\nNow I spend maybe 3 hours every other week doing basic maintenance for her and 4 other units. Deadheading flowers, pulling weeds, watering, sometimes replanting stuff that dies. They each pay me $80/month which is honestly more than fair for what im doing. The best part is I can do it whenever, like ill just knock it out on a Saturday morning or split it between weekdays if im bored.\n\nI already had most of the tools but needed to grab some extra stuff to get started. Good thing I had a bit of money put aside from a St–∞ke win so I could buy what I needed without stressing about it. After that the only real cost is gas to get supplies occasionally. Definitely not gonna quit my day job over it but its easy money for something I kinda enjoy anyway",

Funny thing is, vid probs took him 10 hrs to edit max, and maybe 2hrs of recording.\n\nSo u do the math there.\n\nIt compounds ontop of itself.\n\nThe only reason u don't see more of it is because its very tiring.

      "selftext": "I have a day off, so I decided to do something hopefully useful and share my road on trying to earn income online in between these AI stories.\n\nMy ride is pretty much finished, not because I got financial independence till the rest of my life, but because I have a decent job which I don't hate, and some passive income. Pushing more seems like overkill at this point.\n\n\n\nHere‚Äôs my overview of what worked, and what didn‚Äôt:\n\n\n\nTotal flops:\n\nDropshipping/Shopify type of stuff ‚Äì personally worst imo. I don't know why I kept trying to push it for so long, maybe due to hype from every \"make 10k a month\" guru and course.\n\nPerhaps I haven't found the right niche. Not to say that I haven't made sales, occasionally some things were very close to being profitable, like portable blenders or fishing lures.\n\nBut for some reason it was never sustainable and maybe because I'm not very tech savvy ‚Äì time consuming. Ended up losing money overall.\n\n\n\nDigital products ‚Äì Every kid trying to sell their GPT prompts. Too easy to do. Pretty much lost money trying it.\n\n\n\nSemi-worked:\n\nAI girls ‚Äì Got in a bit too late, but still managed to make some money. Up to this day getting like $150, made like 100 posts and scheduled them every couple of days. If there are still some subs left in a year I will spend an extra half a day making another 100. At some point it was $3k‚Äôish a month, mainly coming from adult site ads. But once it got too popular it got shut down and they banned these type of ads. Some niche stuff might still work.\n\n\n\nPrint-on-demand ‚Äì Looks saturated, but worked alright-ish for me. Not online though, mainly contacting local businesses. So made a decent income.\n\nThe idea is that most businesses are okay with spending 500 on some custom printed t-shirts, but never proactively get in touch with someone. So if you show some samples, and make them an offer, they quite often said, ‚Äúalright, send them and give invoice.‚Äù Pretty straightforward.\n\n\n\nWhat worked best:\n\nAffiliate ‚Äì even though it seems very 2010, there are still products/niches that work well.\n\nFor B2B Semrush worked okay, because they are the leaders in the field. The idea was to approach new businesses that were trying to improve their reach and marketing and consult them about how they should move forward.\n\nHarder to get, but they pay out well and in time.\n\n\n\nFor B2C ‚Äì tried some pet stores, they have high margins usually so payout is good, but harder to push to market and you need to keep promoting the thing. Once you stop there is zero momentum.\n\n\n\nWhat worked for me is trying to find a niche that is not saturated, product works well and you can make recurring revenue. Like services that help find someone on Tinder ‚Äì I worked with DoTheySwipe which has a pretty accurate algorithm and people buy their monthly plans because they are insecure about their partners. So while Quora/adult ads are not crazy money and earn 15‚Äì20% more or less, the next month you can sit and do nothing and a bunch of subscription money will come in. Some people just never cancel.\n\n\n\nCrypto projects ‚Äì I think the hype train is going down, but that's where I made the most money. Not by buying their tokens, but by approaching them and outsourcing the services. Something like copywriting, social media posting, content creation etc.\n\nMost of them have a lot of money initially and would take your services. Then I'd go to Fiverr or Upwork and outsource decent freelancers from third world countries. Had like 3 projects I worked with and was charging them thousands, while paying pennies on the dollar.\n\n\n\nBeen a rough ride, but in a nutshell my conclusions are that while sometimes it's worth chasing the hype, it's usually not sustainable.\n\nAnd if you want to make FU money, at the end of the day you will have to do business and that's going to come with consequences, such as sleepless nights and constant stress.\n\nBut side gigs and income are for sure very reasonable and achievable.

Basically what I did is take a hobby I love (I made modifications to video games) and try to do it to the best of my ability. Try to be as professional as possible, push myself to learn and grow. That‚Äôs it. Push your hobbies into a professional sphere. That‚Äôs how to do it. \n\nAgain this was a hobby I did for fun but it started with making video game modifications. Personally I started make a small amount of passive income (300$ a month) via hosting the modifications on a site that generates ad revenu from adds in the sides bars of the site, then made an official company out if it down the line for myself (just me as owner operator and hobby in free time). Started occasionally hiring one time payment contractors to do tasks for me- built a catalog of successes partnered with a game company and started creating content for them which if used I make money off the sales my work is used in. This turned it into about 900$+ a month some months over 1000$ a month passive income. \n\nNow I‚Äôm slowing that down and decided to write a sci-fi book. It‚Äôs in total about 350 pages, will be part of a series and I‚Äôm working to make it as professional as possible with the goal to publish. Again this is a hobby. It‚Äôs for fun. But if I get it published my fun could net me well who knows anywhere from 2,000 or 5,000 to 15,000 off the bat plus any extra the book makes. I‚Äôll assume lowest so let‚Äôs just say 2000 or something for a book that took me 9 months for fun in my free time. I learned how to write better, and I‚Äôm learning what publishing looks like and how to sell it to them. \n\nTo me that‚Äôs the legit way to make passive income. It takes more work. More time it‚Äôs not a get rich quick scheme it build skills and if you want to constantly push yourself in your hobbies and take it to a professional degree then it‚Äôll happen. ",

      "selftext": "From February to June this year, i worked on this project in Oneforma called OceanData. Everything was fine, until the last month. In June, I was due to be paid ~370 dollars. When the day came tho, nothing. I soon realized it was because I only had my Paypal linked, and at the time (not sure if this is still a thing) they had this asinine rule where you could only receive payments in Paypal up to 300 dollars a year. \n\nSo I begrudgingly made a Payoneer account and e-mailed them about the issue. Unfortunately, as anyone who has tried to email Oneforma has found out, they don't ever reply. I'm convinced there's not a single person checking that account. \n\nI emailed them 2 or 3 more times after, but nothing. I still had hope though; I could still see the invoices on the Oneforma page, showing up as \"ready to pay\". \n\nRecently though, I opened the website again, and to my surprise, I found they've redesigned it. And when checking the payments tab, all the old payments are gone. Both the ones that did get paid, and those that I never got. So now I don't really have any proof other than some PO IDs and screenshots of the project manager showing part of what I was supposed to be paid for the month of June. But then again, I don't think proof matters when they completely ignore your emails.\n\nSorry for the rant. Has anyone had an issue like this, and if so did you manage to solve it? I've honestly resigned myself to the fact I'm not ever seeing that money, but I'd like to know if there is a chance. Thank you.",

Last time I checked, it wasn't 1970. Federal minimum wage is $7.25/hour. So they're definitely acting illegally. Now I don't know if I should even trust this company at all! Six dollars an hour. Holy moses, that's a red flag and criminal. Also on the site I chose work from home. 700 jobs show up and most all are hybrid. That is NOT 'remote' in my opinion. Telus should put hybrid jobs under a hybrid tag and remote jobs (meaning 100% work from home) under a remote tag. This is disheartening. I was really thrilled I'd maybe finally have my first ever work from home job. I'll keep looking. But what do you all think? $6 an hour?!\n\nEdit: apologies.

Awkward smalltalk for a solid 10 minutes, then she says that her colleague had no idea that there's an interview, he came in, all unorganized and extremely unpleasant. When I told him that I come from an IT background, he told me that we \"have to see about that\" and proceeded to stutter his presentation that he didn't even finish before telling the other woman that he wants to be the one \"to test me\" (that was her part) - after declining to see my CV or any other information about me that she offered, because \"we're gonna do this differently\", then he had me in this roleplay where the other person (him) was basically barely smart enough to breath on their own, \"never used a phone in their life\" (but knows what they want to use and why) and then he made the whole thing very difficult, describing things to me in a manner that made it impossible for me to fully understand what he's talking about, still made it all the way through helping with this \"issue\", he of course found something to critique while the female co-worker was throwing positive remarks at me left and right. He then explained things to me like I was too dumb to breath on my own and said that he's gonna \"think about it and it'll probably take a couple of days\", but I was called 10 minutes later and they said I have the job.\n\nIt's call-center support, but I'm supposed to sell stuff while helping with issues, when I said that I know about selling stuff, that I have experience in it, he said that it's not like that. They're not selling things, it's just an offer. Before he said that they expect me to at least sell 2 things per month in the same breath. And how one in his team sold 30 plans this month and how much more money I can make, how I can get better positions with time, so many chances, bla bla, it was this weird mixture of talking like everyone is beneath him, how much everyone can gain from this and then being extremely pushy with the selling, to then say that this is not what the job is about. \"After the training the job starts, it's a real job after all, fun and games are over\" (??) and \"We're like McDonald's, offering mayo and ketchup with their meal\" and \"Are you able to help when someone is calling and their stuff isn't working but they didn't open the package yet?\", what a strange strange person.\n\nThey sent me the contract almost immediately, what they're paying is really bad, but \"the majority of your income will be from selling\" (which this isn't about, right?), the hours are insane, they expect you to do more hours which they don't pay for, the list goes on. I got the thing yesterday and they already called me and wrote emails and told me that I have to sign it before the link expires, I told them that I want to read and understand everything first. They are very pushy. I talked to 3 people and everyone gives different answers. I asked about my other applications, they told me that they're not looking at them anymore since we're in this process now, the next day I get an email about one of the other jobs, I asked if I still have a chance, they said yes, then she calls me today and says that the other jobs are full and \"I have this now, it's already starting\", even though I didn't sign anything.\n\nAnyway. I'm in a shitty position, I really need a job. But I also need my sanity.  \nAre there even chances to get more money? Are they as pushy as it seems?  \nCan anyone actually recommend Concentrix?\n\nThank you for your time.",

I‚Äôm no genius myself, but I do run a SaaS, and it‚Äôs wild to me how much brainpower sits on the sidelines.\n\nAfter meeting hundreds of high-potential people in corporate and tech, I think it‚Äôs less about money or ideas and more about comfort. Smart people often build stable, well-paid careers, and the thought of ditching that certainty for the chaos of entrepreneurship is just not appealing. Also, there‚Äôs the curse of seeing too many risks. Being able to see every possible way something could go wrong can paralyze you before you ever start.\n\nWhen I started my business SocLeads, there were at least ten voices in my head telling me why it would fail and none telling me to just try it and learn. Most people don‚Äôt need more brains or better ideas, they need permission to try, get things wrong, and not have it wreck their self-image.\n\nI really believe talent is everywhere, but momentum is rare. Sometimes average people win just because they‚Äôre willing to send that first cold email, launch an early version, or risk looking dumb.\n\nWhat do you think?",

The issue is that you don‚Äôt feel the price until it‚Äôs too late.\n\nThere‚Äôs also the curse of intelligence imo like others suggested here. The smarter you are, the better you are at simulating risk (overthinking). You can see 274 ways a business will fail before you even start, and that ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù  becomes more powerful than just taking action and course correcting.\n\nI think that this raises a deeper point. Most entrepreneurs are not ‚Äúbraver‚Äù by nature. They were pushed (in some way shape or form), in childhood. The first business is often fueled by a pain like running away from rejection, insecurity, or anger. For me, it started when I got laughed at for telling my dad I would buy the dodge viper from the TV ad at 13. Later, I got fired unfairly from a hotel job. That humiliation became rocket fuel, which eventually made me start my real estate company  partly because I wanted to own that hotel one day and fire the manager myself.\n\nI guess some high IQ people avoid entrepreneurship not because they lack talent, but they lack the wound that forces them to bet on themselves. And in that case, comfort usually wins the mental battle. And whether that decision shows up as regret on a deathbed is hard to know..",

Time, money, focus, drive, motivation, passion, and kicks them in the nuts with failure after failure after failure. There‚Äôs no good reason to be an entrepreneur except the one that got you through yesterday. Every time you wake up, you have to push yourself forward no matter what‚Äôs happening. No matter how you feel. And there is no reward most of the time. No one sees your pain and losses. No one hears about your bad day. But you hear about everyone else‚Äôs. You learn that _employee_ is Latin for ‚Äúheadache‚Äù. You learn that people are selfish and don‚Äôt care about each other, they don‚Äôt care about the big picture, and they certainly don‚Äôt care about whatever you care about especially if what you care about is them. Because _they don‚Äôt have to_. I‚Äôve built 11 ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù businesses. I don‚Äôt work at all anymore. I‚Äôm not retired I‚Äôm just leveraged and if you want to leverage yourself you have to put yourself at risk over and over and over again until you become the risk. \n\nObviously I don‚Äôt recommend being an entrepreneur.

Decent pastries, cakes and stuff, nothing special and just about breaking even.\n\nThen she pivoted hard into the \"coffee shop\" vibe and renamed it something pretentious with \"&amp; Co.\" at the end. She's charging ¬£3.80 for a flat white and ¬£4.20 for a cappuccino. Premium prices for the area.\n\nThe coffee is made with a Nespresso Vertuo Pop she got for ¬£99 from Argos and pods that cost about 38p each when bought in bulk. No barista skills needed, just stick in a pod and press a button. She's making ¬£3+ profit per cup after the pod cost.\n\nThe irony is she first saw this machine when she came to my house. I've had this machine for yonks and I know that if you stick with the safe options like Costa Rica, El Salvador, Colombia, Mexico and those kind of pods, you just can't go wrong and nobody gonna have a clue.\n\nThere's a proper ¬£2k+ commercial espresso machine in the corner, the kind you'd expect in a specialty coffee shop. Customers can barely see it unless they're really looking or go out of their way to look behind the counter.\n\nShe bought it broken on purpose. Found it on Facebook Marketplace for dirt cheap and it's purely for aesthetics. It's never worked, it's literally just a prop.\n\nBehind that machine is the Nespresso machine doing all the actual work.\n\nFrom what she's told me she's selling 170+ cups a day on average. Rough maths says that's ¬£500+ in daily coffee revenue alone (not counting pastries) which is approx \\~¬£15k a month just from coffee.\n\nThe customers seem to be raving about it on Google reviews.\n\nPart of me thinks this is genius cos she's created an environment people want to be in and they're happy to pay premium prices. She laughs it off saying \"restaurants mark up wine 300%, nobody bats an eye\".\n\nIs this just smart business? She's asking me to join her and double down.",

On Windows there‚Äôs Wallpaper Engine, but on Mac everything I tried was slow, subscription-based, or had watermarks. So I just decided to build one myself.\n\nI didn‚Äôt expect much, honestly thought it would stay a small side project. But here‚Äôs where it ended up:  \n‚Äì $11,102 in revenue  \n‚Äì 1,380 paid licenses sold  \n‚Äì 55,000 website visitors  \n‚Äì 12,876 active users\n\nThe pricing is simple. Free version with 18 wallpapers, unlimited time, full quality, no watermarks. Pro unlock is a one-time lifetime license.¬†**No subscriptions.**¬†That decision turned out to be a key differentiator. People hate paying a monthly fee for something like wallpapers, and a lot of buyers even said they purchased just to support the project.\n\nAll growth came from organic channels. Reddit posts, word of mouth, and unexpectedly a few Telegram channels with over 2M subs that shared it. No ads. No influencer marketing. The¬†**app being open source**¬†gave a lot of trust too.\n\nChallenges:  \n‚Äì macOS updates constantly break things (lock screen wallpapers, menu bar glitches, etc.), so keeping up is tough  \n‚Äì App Store release is harder than expected and still not done  \n‚Äì Support requests scale fast once you pass a few thousand users\n\nBut overall, it‚Äôs been one of the most fun and surprising projects I‚Äôve worked on. Building something small but polished, launching it in the right places, and being transparent worked way better than I expected.\n\n(If anyone‚Äôs curious, app is called **Wallper)**",

Was it a bad hire, a failed product launch, trusting the wrong partner, or something else entirely?\n\nI‚Äôll bite and share mine. A couple years ago I built a lead gen tool SocLeads for small businesses. I spent months focused on adding every feature people requested, thinking the more complete it was, the easier it would be to sell. The screw-up was not validating which pain points actually mattered, so I ended up with a bloated product no one was really excited to buy. Only after tons of wasted dev time did I realize I should have been laser-focused on solving just one painful, expensive problem for a clear niche.\n\nLesson learned: more features almost never fix your core value prop.\n\nI feel like sometimes those painful lessons stick the most. Would love to hear your stories (and maybe learn what NOT to do next time).",

We burned $3.7M.\n\nThey were huge. Tons of money. Tons of confidence. But all their ideas were old-school. In tech, speed and trust matter more than capital. And trust isn‚Äôt just about people  you have to trust your model, your process, and the market you‚Äôre actually in.\n\nWe hired hundreds of people. Built a super talented team. But leadership kept pulling from what had made them rich in the past. Those methods worked in traditional industries, but in fast tech cycles they were poison.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I took away:\n\n* Past success creates blind spots. What made you millions yesterday might bury you tomorrow.\n* Big money with a small vision burns faster than no money at all.\n* A strong team can‚Äôt save a weak mindset at the top.\n\nThe real killer wasn‚Äôt lack of capital or talent.

I‚Äôm also preparing for a master‚Äôs degree, and in the meantime, I enjoy building cool projects. I built multiple projects: some are solo, good for my resume, and some have real business potential. Right now, I‚Äôm working on a project that‚Äôll be almost done within 1‚Äì2 days, but I‚Äôm confused and a little anxious. It‚Äôs not about the project or market potential. I‚Äôm worried about reaching a real audience.\n\nTo be honest, I‚Äôm an ambivert, an average guy with technical skills, so I don‚Äôt have social media followers. I have accounts on every social platform, and I use X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit daily. I have Instagram and Facebook accounts too, but my followers there aren‚Äôt the audience I need ...most are friends, relatives, or random people from my area. LinkedIn is totally a mess for me. On X I have only about 80 followers and maybe one or two likes per post. I have X Premium and I‚Äôm waiting for verification. Facebook and Instagram are almost dead accounts, and I won‚Äôt even talk about LinkedIn.\n\nBeyond that, the algorithms aren‚Äôt in my favour. I also have a YouTube channel where I used to post gameplay videos and random vlogs back in 10th standard. For some reason, I removed everything and started fresh ...now I have one video with 200 views and 70 subscribers.\n\nSo this is my current situation, and I‚Äôm worried about how I‚Äôll reach my audience when I launch. In college, I built multiple projects and animated the software in videos and posted across multiple social media handles, but I never got noticed because there was no crowd. Finally, I‚Äôm starting indie-hacking for side income, but I‚Äôm totally new to this field and I know indie hacking is not just development ..it‚Äôs marketing. I struggled a lot in college and still do; I‚Äôm not from a rich family, and I‚Äôm technically unemployed now, so I don‚Äôt have much money to invest in marketing.\n\nPlease, if anyone can help me with this, I‚Äôm open to advice and suggestions.  \nThank you.",

They build followers after solving a real problem people care about.\n\nHere's your actual issue: you've built multiple projects that \"never got noticed\" which tells me you're probably building stuff nobody asked for. The market doesn't care about cool technical projects, it cares about whether you're solving a painful problem.\n\nBefore launching in 1-2 days, answer honestly: have you talked to 20-30 people who have the problem your project solves? Did they say they'd pay for it? If not, you're about to launch into the void just like your previous projects.\n\nFor reaching users with no budget:\n\nFind where your target users hang out. Specific subreddits, Discord servers, Facebook groups, wherever they discuss the problem you solve. Be genuinely helpful there for a week without mentioning your project. Build credibility, then launch. Those people will actually care because you've proven you understand their problems.\n\nPost on relevant subreddits but make it a story about the problem you're solving and why existing solutions suck, not a product ad. Our clients who do this well get way more traction.\n\nReach out directly to 10-20 people who'd benefit. Send personalized messages explaining why it'd help them specifically. Offer free access for honest feedback.\n\nCancel X Premium, it's a waste of money with no audience. Verification doesn't make your posts reach more people, good content does.\n\nThe biggest mistake is building first and thinking about audience later. Successful indie hackers build audience while building product. They talk about the problem, share their process, engage with users throughout. You can't show up on launch day with no presence and expect people to care.\n\nStop coding for the next 2 days and talk to potential users. Find 10 people with the problem and show them what you built. If they're not excited enough to use it immediately, you've got a product problem marketing can't fix.\n\nYour technical skills don't mean shit if you're building stuff nobody wants. Our customers who make money from side projects validated demand before writing code. You're doing it backwards.\n\nIndie hacking for income while unemployed and preparing for masters is honestly a lot. Most successful projects take 6-12 months to generate meaningful income. If you need money soon, get a part-time gig while you build.\n\nStop worrying about algorithms and followers. Focus on whether you're solving a real problem for real people.

Then ask those 10 to introduce you to one friend each who has the same problem. Personal referral is the highest-converting channel that exists and it costs zero dollars. If they will not refer you, your product is not good enough yet.\n\n**After 100 users (systems kick in):**\nBy now you know which communities or channels sent you the best users. Double down there. Create content that helps people in that space (tutorials, case studies, before/after comparisons). The content brings people to you instead of you hunting them.\n\n**What will NOT work:**\n- Spamming your link everywhere (banned instantly, zero trust)\n- Waiting for organic discovery (nobody finds you by accident)\n- Building in private and launching with a big reveal (momentum dies in 48 hours)\n\n**The real secret:**\nLaunch to 10 people, get feedback, improve, launch to 10 more. Repeat weekly. Small continuous launches beat one big launch every time. Your 9-to-5 gives you runway. Use that advantage. Most founders have to go big immediately because they are burning savings. You can test slowly and learn deeply.\n\nBeing an ambivert is fine. You do not need to be loud. You need to be helpful in the right places. Start with the communities closest to your problem space and work outward.",

I know those vary, but I'm looking for some confirmation or denial to know which way to go.\n\nThe app I've made came from the fact that social media has gone off the rails in term of social interaction. Most of it is reels, there's 0 connection involved, and productivity is plummeting. The 30 minute ick is becoming an often used term (users jump on social media to spend 5 minutes, and they stay for 30+, after which they're depressed and disgusted with themselves due to the wasted time), and studies show mental health issues and dissatisfaction due to social media is constantly on the rise.\n\nWhat I'm trying to do is solve all of those issues by combining real interaction (mood prompts, praise systems, common goals, shared journals, get-to-know-me quizzes, etc.), productivity tools (also shareable with your circle) and mental health tools.\n\nI've gotten some decent feedback so far from coworkers and friends/family, some using the app actively, but I want real feedback from people who don't feel obligated to say it's a good idea.\n\nSo, do you think the idea has traction? Would you use a social app that's more focused on bettering one's self, improving connection with loved ones and mental health?

Most are either dead or irrelevant now because they couldn't crack the fundamental network effects problem.\n\nPeople use Instagram and TikTok because that's where everyone already is. Your app being better or healthier doesn't matter if none of their friends are on it. Our clients who've tried launching social networks learned this the hard way, you need massive viral growth from day one or you're just another empty platform where people sign up, see nobody they know, and delete it.\n\nThe features you're describing sound more like a wellness or productivity app than a social network honestly. Mood prompts, shared journals, and productivity tools are fine, but they're not really social features. They're personal development tools with some sharing capabilities. That's not necessarily bad, but you gotta figure out what you actually are because the positioning is confusing.\n\nThe people who complain most about social media being toxic often don't actually switch platforms. They keep using Instagram while saying they hate it. The 30 minute doom scroll problem isn't solved by a different app, it's a behavior issue. Our customers in the mental health space see this constantly, people know what's bad for them but changing behavior is really damn hard.\n\nFriend and family feedback is worthless for validation. They're telling you what you wanna hear. Real validation is getting 100 strangers to pay for your app or use it daily for a month without you reminding them. Until you've got that, you don't actually know if there's market demand.\n\nIf you really wanna pursue this, pick one specific niche community and build for them exclusively. Don't try to replace all of social media, that's impossible. Maybe it's for parents trying to stay connected without the comparison trap, or remote teams wanting better communication, or accountability partners for specific goals. Narrow focus gives you a shot at critical mass within one group.\n\nStop asking if the world needs this and start proving specific people will actually use it consistently. That's the only validation that matters.",

Launched 4 before (2 still active). Did all of this while working a regular full-time job. \n\nHere are all the marketing hacks that moved the needle:\n\n1. Build in public. \n\nYes, nothing revolutionary here. We're in the B2B space (or prosumer at the very least) and I do believe it helps if people know you. \n\nPersonally, I don't even publish that much about our startup (since there isn't something super exciting happening all the time) to not come off as salesy. Instead, just sharing tidbits about my life, things I find interesting, opinions I have, places I travel to, and so forth. \n\nJust be a normal human being and realize that post people, especially on social media, don't actually care much about your business (at least not to the extent they care about you as a person). \n\nPieter (Levels), I find, does this exceptionally well. Maybe every 5-6th of his posts is about a product of his and he mostly just talks about things he finds interesting. \n\n2. Case studies\n\nI wanted to mention this as a separate point, even though it's utilizing the same platforms (X and Threads). \n\nIn our case, I share successful slideshows other accounts publish on TikTok, detailing the copy they use, the products they promote, influencers they work with, and such. \n\nThis is the part where we deliberately target our ICP - and where we see the highest ROI in terms of conversions. \n\nIntuitively, that somewhat makes sense. Many in the app space, for example, are still somewhat unaware of the benefits of slideshows, so seeing successful examples (and how you can replicate them) is oftentimes all the inspiration you need to get started. \n\n3. Building what our competitors are missing\n\nThere's one competitor in our product category who sucks up most of the oxygen (since he was the first to launch a product in the category). \n\nHowever, his product is still missing tons of essential features. So, we simply built those (e.g., workspace &amp; team features) based on customer queries. \n\nAgain, this also ties back into point 1. Those prospective customers wouldn't have found us if it wasn't for building in public. And then we executed quickly once they did. \n\n4. Experiment with pricing\n\nWe initially started with a simple subscription like anyone does. However, what we soon realized talking to our users is that many don't want to pay for and use all of the features our product offers. \n\nAs a result, we introduced a credit-based system and split up our plans into four distinct tiers, with one plan only offering the most basic of features (so that customers can then top up with credits if they need access to any of the other features). \n\nAnd now some of our customers actually spend hundreds of $$$ just on credits while still being on the cheapest tier. \n\n5. Message your competitor's customers\n\nOur main competitor is pretty active on socials, so every time he'd post, we simply would send a message to all the people who replied. \n\nIt works really well if you take point 3 serious and can use those differentiating features as the baseline for your message (e.g., \"Hey, I saw that you use x, I work on y and we have the following features abc that you may find interesting). \n\nI feel like way too many indie hackers want to play nice, be liked, and don't step on anyone's toes. \n\nThis is a business you're trying to run after all, so be as brazen as you humanly can. \n\n6. YouTube\n\nIronically, as I am typing this, our YouTube channel just got banned lol. This one hurts because it had been converting super well, especially considering the still fairly low amount of views. \n\nThe simple reason is intent. We mostly did search-based videos (e.g., people looking for how to do xyz), which meant that intent is super high.\n\nThe great thing about search-based YouTube is that those videos also tend to rank for a long time (as people keep searching for that keyword). \n\nHopefully we can get our channel back because it was actually the acquisition channel I was excited the most for and spending a substantial amount of time on. \n\n  \n\\--- \n\nIf you guys have any questions, feel free to ask away :)  \n",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone. For context, we‚Äôve been running internal benchmark research to see how different promotions affect sales and engagement. One trap that keeps popping up is that vendors have trained customers to a certain behavior. And it backfires. What I mean is that when people want something in a $$$-$$$$$ range, they just wait for the next big sale. Black Friday, mid-season, clearance, whatever ‚Äî they know patience pays.\n\nSo the obvious question: what‚Äôs the alternative? We‚Äôve seen brands testing widgets with bundles, gifts for purchase, free shipping, loyalty rewards, etc. Some of these help margins and engagement, but the numbers are mixed.\n\nBundles work for AOV, but feel forced, especially if a customer doesn't really need the second item. Gifts are great, but you attract freebie hunters who buy just for the bonus. Loyalty programs are just too slow to show results, and people want quick wins.\n\nWhatever you choose, it‚Äôs like trying to outrun Beyonc√© at the Grammys. However, one lever we‚Äôve seen working better than others is free shipping thresholds. Shoppers hate paying for delivery, so they‚Äôre more likely to add extra items to the cart just to cross the line. Psychologically, it trains shoppers‚Äô behavior in a way that actually encourages paying, rather than waiting for discounts.\n\nFor the sake of research (and curiosity), have you guys found anything that can compete with -50% off in terms of conversion and profitability?\n\n",

          "body": "You‚Äôre right about discount conditioning. What‚Äôs worked best for me when we wanted Black-Friday-level conversion without torching margin:\n\n1. Shipping threshold tuned to the 70th‚Äì80th percentile cart. If your median cart is 42 and p80 is 58, set free shipping at 55‚Äì60. This reliably bumps AOV without training people to wait.\n2. Choice bundles, not forced kits. Let buyers pick any 2 or 3 from a curated set and auto-apply a small step discount. Perceived control beats bigger blanket cuts and returns stay lower.\n3. Store credit instead of percent off. Example: spend 60, get 10 store credit that activates in 14 days. You protect margin now and pull a second purchase later.\n4. Limited value adds that cost you pennies but feel premium. Examples: extended warranty, priority handling, sample sizes, engraving, install help. These attract fewer freebie hunters than high-value gifts.\n5. Private promos to warm audiences only. Email, SMS, loyalty tiers. Public site stays full price so you don‚Äôt anchor future traffic to sales.\n6. Creator or affiliate bonuses that stack as a value add, not a price cut. Let partners include their mini course, template, or preset pack with your product via unique codes. Conversion pop without training for minus fifty.\n7. Price integrity play. Keep list price stable, run fast 48-hour campaigns on specific outcomes instead of storewide sales. Example: ‚ÄúWorkspace refresh event‚Äù with free desk mat plus credit on organizers. Clear theme beats generic discounts.\n\nMeasure with holdouts. Optimize thresholds quarterly, not weekly. The only things I‚Äôve seen truly compete with 50 percent off are shipping thresholds plus credit-back mechanics, because they increase willingness to pay today and bring people back later.",

      "selftext": "Hey my online brothers and sisters,\n\nSome of you might remember me from last spring when I started the whole ‚Äúdropshipping has 9 lives‚Äù experiment. The idea was simple. Could I, relying only on my past experience, once again take a store from 0 to 100K profitably and without overcomplicating it. I wanted to motivate beginners, prove the ‚Äúdropshipping is dead‚Äù crowd wrong, and take a jab at the wannabe gurus who promise flying Lambos, threesomes with Sydney Sweeney and Emily Ratajkowski, and instant success just by manifesting it.\n\nBack then I even promised that once the store hit 100K I would give it away to someone here. Shame on me, that never happened. And there are reasons. First, I was honestly shocked by how many store flippers are lurking here, ready to acquire and resell sites to who knows who and at what price.\n\nSecond, the ‚Äúhey bro just give me the store‚Äù messages kept coming for weeks and months, often from people who clearly had no clue about even the basic foundations of dropshipping, and that was a huge turn off for me.\n\nSo instead of giving the store away and shutting it down, I just kept growing it. Now after $1M in sales I decided, with the help of my former mentor, to use it as an open free case study.\n\nSo, here is what we covered so far:  \n‚Ä¢ How to build a professional looking store with free themes, free graphic resources and free apps  \n‚Ä¢ How to connect it properly with payment methods and social accounts  \n‚Ä¢ How to acquire payment processors and keep them \"alive\"  \n‚Ä¢ Learning about niches, which ones are the most lucrative and why  \n‚Ä¢ How to properly do product research and quickly find completely untapped products, showing our own unique methods  \n‚Ä¢ How to run Meta Ads and stay profitable in today‚Äôs Andromeda chaos, covering everything from ad copy, creatives, campaign setup, metrics, product testing, scaling, and making a bulletproof system in case of ad account shutdowns  \n‚Ä¢ How to run Google Ads, covering basically the same topics as on Meta  \n‚Ä¢ How to run a Shopify store, focusing on the technical side of it, covering everything from fulfilment of orders to store redesigns for events like Black Friday and more  \n‚Ä¢ How to do customer support, which no one likes to talk about but is just as important as product research and marketing\n\nWhat is still in the works:  \n‚Ä¢ Fighting and winning chargebacks  \n‚Ä¢ TikTok marketing\n\nAll of you are invited to participate so we can finally create something valuable and free, something that we can all learn from. I truly believe this industry, with the flood of AI tools and everything moving online, will only become easier to manage and more lucrative in the future.\n\nAnd yes, happy beginning of Q4. That‚Äôs all from me for now brothers and sisters, talk to you soon.",

Social proof isn't a vanity metric; it's a credibility signal for both users and algorithms. A page that looks active and discussed simply performs better.\n\nMy own sites didn't gain traction until I started treating social validation as a core part of my launch strategy for key articles. Using a service like Viral Rabbi to seed that initial, foundational layer of engagement was the catalyst. It made my content look established and trustworthy, which kept real users on the page longer. Google noticed the improved metrics, and the organic growth finally followed.

They are happy they have negotiated what they'd likely have had anyway. \n\nI have also done things like chuck a few FOC items on a first order. Costs me very little, buys me goodwill and on second order and third and fourth and...I get my price.\n\nIm dealing with repeat business so its all lifetime value. I might also tell them I can give them 30 days EOM terms vs 30 days net which is our standard. Albeit they dont know 30 days EOM is in effect our standard as I played the same trick on most! \n\nSo selling to them what they'd have got anyway is my tactic. And its surprisingly effective. \n\nDiscounting from the off basically is an invitation to have a real struggle managing price up from thereon. \n\nSometimes I may take a customer on at a lower price than Id like to win and then work to tie them in so heavily to us that over a period of time we can get the margins up, the long game.

      "selftext": "A few months ago, I had an idea I couldn‚Äôt shake. The problem was familiar: every time I‚Äôve had an idea in the past, I either got stuck in analysis paralysis or went down the rabbit hole of coding, logos, product names, and all the ‚Äúfun‚Äù distractions. Weeks or months would pass before I showed it to anyone, and by then I usually lost steam or realised nobody wanted it.\n\nThis time, I forced myself to do the opposite. My goal was simple: could I get strangers to care about my idea in less than a weekend? No product, no backend, no fancy branding. Just the bare minimum to test the interest.\n\nSo I worked on creating a landing page. To get people onto the page, I did two things. First, I shared it in a couple of communities where I knew the target audience hang out. Second, I put about $250 into very small ads just to see if anyone outside my personal network would click through. Nothing fancy.\n\nThe results surprised me. In 4 days, about 220 people visited the page. 63 of them actually signed up. That‚Äôs almost 30%. And a few of those people even replied to the confirmation email I sent, asking me questions about the idea and saying they‚Äôd pay for something like this if it existed. That was the kind of signal I never got from building in a vacuum.\n\nWas it perfect? No. But it gave me more validation in two days than months of building ever had. And honestly, it took the pressure off. Instead of wondering ‚Äúdoes anyone want this?‚Äù I could move forward knowing at least a small group of people had raised their hands.\n\nSo if you‚Äôre sitting on an idea and spinning your wheels, don‚Äôt overthink it. Write down the problem clearly, describe how you‚Äôd solve it, and put up a simple landing page with a signup form. Drive a little traffic and watch what happens. Even if you only get a handful of signups, that‚Äôs still real feedback from real people.",

Just me figuring it out, messing it up, and trying again.\n\nThis week my dashboard rolled over the $480,000 mark in total revenue (I know it's a pretty specific milestone number but [4 &amp; 8] are my favorite numbers, haha). It didn‚Äôt come fast. The first year I made $0-$500 for 9 months. I was SO CLOSE to quitting after a string of chargebacks. A contractor ghosted me LITERALLY mid project and I had to refund work I couldn‚Äôt afford to refund. I still take calls from a cheap desk in my second bathroom (that I never used and converted over into an office)...\n\nI know this isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmade it‚Äù / retirement money and I‚Äôm not trying to sell anything. I just needed to say it somewhere so people understand what it costs to get even this far. The late nights. The ‚Äúis this stupid?‚Äù loop. The quiet wins nobody sees. I promise you it pays off no matter how much you don't get it\n\nIf you‚Äôre early: keep building those fundamental structure points.. If you‚Äôre further along: RESPECT!\n\n Today I‚Äôm just letting myself feel proud for a second, then it‚Äôs back to grind.\n\nNo links, no pitch, no \"click on my profile\" hidden motive BS.. \n\njust sharing a moment with folks who get it...\n\nEdit: Wow, I wasn‚Äôt expecting this much feedback haha. Appreciate everyone who took the time to comment. For anyone wondering how it started, my first few clients came from straight cold outreach emails and calls (my gf handled the emails while I handled the calls) until someone finally said yes. Nothing fancy, just persistence. And if your quality matches that persistence then most the time you can count word of mouth as a big source of your business. \n\nSIDENOTE: IF YOU'RE ABLE TO FIND DECENT QUALITY SALES REPRESENTATIVES WILLING TO WORK FOR COMMISSION.. it really paid off for me and can really help speed along that process. My mother always told me that one head is good but two heads is better, but I think ten heads is even better than that and so on and so forth ... Obviously it's not mandatory but in my case it really helped me cover more ground than I would have been able to, alone.",

          "body": "Reading your story really hits home because I‚Äôve faced similar long, uphill climbs where progress felt slow and full of setbacks like chargebacks and unreliable contractors. There‚Äôs so much unseen grinding behind every milestone like yours, the endless late nights and moments of doubt I can relate to deeply. I remember turning my own spare corner of a home into an office, hustling with cold outreach and second-guessing decisions, yet inching forward with persistence and learning. The way you kept the faith, stuck to fundamentals, and eventually built a system that brought consistent revenue is exactly what many entrepreneurs aspire to but few capture in words so honestly.\n\nOne practical thought is your insight about commission-based sales reps, which can exponentially expand reach and lighten your load when you‚Äôre ready to scale beyond solo efforts. Persistence coupled with quality work becomes magnetic, you build momentum that sustains the grind. Celebrate this $480K with pride, it‚Äôs a testament to your resilience and smart hustle, and let it fuel the next phase of growth. I coach entrepreneurs through these stages of hard-won success and scaling, helping them build teams and systems to multiply impact while maintaining what they‚Äôve crafted. Your story encourages anyone stuck in the grind to keep putting one step forward, because those quiet wins truly do pay off.\n\nAustin Erkl - Entrepreneur Coach",

      "selftext": "If youve been running ads for eCommerce, SaaS, or mobile apps you probably realized Meta ad performance has been abysmal the past year.\n\nWe used to grow eCommerce brands primarily with meta ads but CPMs just kept rising and conversions kept decreasing. And this was BEFORE the latest andromeda update.\n\nAnyways here‚Äôs how we took a Canadian eCommerce brand from $80k in April to over $300k (CAD) in June. They sell sleepwear but this approach also works for B2C SaaS, record labels &amp; mobile apps.\n\nHope this helps even one person ahead of Q4.\n\nHere are the exact steps:\n\n1. Get a bunch of US phones with TikTok then scroll the explore page and like things in your niche. Search for related hashtags, then engage with the videos so your feed is personalized.\n\n2. Prepare a TON of videos by replicating what you see on your #foryou page. Literally copy and redo the videos and follow formats that are already proven to work. This can be as simple as a 20 second video with a caption over it and a viral song. Don‚Äôt overthink it! For eCommerce also carousels work really well.\n\n3. By using up to 5 hashtags (like #foryou and #explore and niche ones) we get way more views. Also showing human faces, even if AI generated, helps a lot.\n\n4. Then just post like crazy and DON‚ÄôT stop consistent uploads. We posted almost 1,000 videos between April and June. Average view per video was 16k views but that meant some were 800 views and some were 2m.\n\n5. Don‚Äôt put all your hopes on any 1 video. It‚Äôs a numbers game. We posted an average of 16 videos a day across 8 pages. For the first 15 days things looked bleak and it was barely breakeven. Then by day 41 we hit a viral winner. 4 days later another one because once you go viral once on a specific topic / brand it‚Äôs easier to get views. There‚Äôs more awareness around it now.\n\n6. Just keep it simple and rinse and repeat. This beats dumping all your money into Meta and hoping the algorithm treats you well. Also our viral videos ended up becoming some of the top ads for this brand who reused them in paid campaigns.\n\nIf anyone has questions, ask away. Good luck in Q4 everyone!",

AI faces or stock hooks are fine for speed, but the real win is keeping the workflow simple so you can pump volume without burning out.

I have a fair amount of experience in this area and the answer to your question is, it 'depends'. Sorry, probably not what you wanted to hear, but it is what it is.\n\nWe audited all of our manual workflows, and in 80% of the cases, we ended up building custom workflows using n8n, real and gumloop etc.. I would honestly advise you do this. Otherwise you will be chasing your tail with new tools every day and week - which is not feasible if you're trying to focus on growing your business.\n\nBuilding your own workflow will allow you to make it extensible and scalable. You can add more capability as you go. For example, we have MCP servers running on n8n where we continue to plug in more and more additional tools, as the need arises. This gives us massive flexibility. We're in the process of writing a blog automation app. Whilst we could have gone with something like outrank, we decided we wanted more control and specific features built in e.g. anti plagiarism check. We've assessed it should save us at least 4-6 hours per month, once its up and running.\n\nSo - net/net - you need to figure out where you want savings or run a full audit to find inefficiencies - then if you can find something that fits the need 100%, buy it! If you can't find something exact - build it!",

I build websites, optimize, help companies automate their lead flows, handle CPC, analytics, etc, so I spend a lot of time in both web forms and unfortunately, managing my availability calendar.   \n  \nFor a few years now, I have been using CalendarBridge to sync various calendars (recommended by a large client who uses it). My personal Google cal, family calendar, company Outlook 365, and my work availability calendar. Up until recently, I simply shared a single calendar booking page link (synced availability, showed block times, etc) with them and they could book any available time based on availability, instead of the back and forth emails typically relegated to scheduling. I simple got an email saying time was scheduled.\n\nA few months ago, they released an AI meeting scheduling tool (AI Assistant) that I have found priceless and quite time saving. I don't know that it saves 10 hours a week, but it definitely makes things simple, especially when its a group meeting. I send or reply to an email asking about availability, add the assistant email to the cc box and it handles 100% of the scheduling from that point forward with little to no interaction from me, or everyone else on the email.  I named my AI assistant Bridget, and it literally takes over the scheduling, reminders about the meeting, can have discussions with people in email in human tone, etc and helps plan everything around it for me. (Hi, I'm Bridget, Entreprefreak's scheduling assistant... how does Tuesday, July 10th from 3-3:30 pm work for you?)\n\nOne of the companies I work with regularly is a large org who also uses it and when we use the AI scheduler, it literally checks everyone's calendar availability, lets us all know the best date/time for a meeting, adds a video link and puts it on everyone's calendar automatically. Completely replaced round-robin or meeting polls.",

      "selftext": "Hey yall. I read stuff here every now and then and figured I should share my story.\n\nI‚Äôm a software developer that was into it because I saw a future with education technology specifically. \n\nI ended up growing a 125,000 person following on TikTok between 2021-2023 mostly around DEI and tech, while being focused on genuinely teaching people about coding and tech and doing outreach to folks in my culture. \n\nI ended up learning a lot of stuff the hard way. By the time I built my following was around the time I accessed GPT-3 and more or less went all in on edtech entrepreneurship. \n\nIt was honestly super messy at first because GPT user experiences were so new. Around this time was when DEI became less popular, tech layoffs were around the corner and Latino audiences more or less shifted toward outrage politics unfortunately. \n\nI mostly grinded out making fairly unpopular videos. I actually learned that going semi-viral (10k-500k views) didn‚Äôt really produce too many conversions, even with followings.\n\nThat‚Äôs when I started to realize more and more what sales was - personal, targeted and volume. So about of my conversions came from 200-1k view videos actually. \n\nSo far my biggest struggle was that I genuinely care about this stuff, so the disinterest with my following kinda tilts me often. I guess if it matters, I created a system where you can essentially create scholarships with learning. I‚Äôm kinda jaded about talking about how I accomplished that but I‚Äôm proud that I did. \n\nAnyway, I sold $1 subscriptions for a while and folks that cared suggested that I open up $3 and $8 subscriptions too which honestly kept things afloat. So it was cool to learn that people are just there to support too when you‚Äôre being genuine and hard working. \n\nAfter a while, working against the current, I started to explore more with pricing and learned people were willing to pay $10, $2, $25 and even $50/mo subscriptions which was very validating. It meant that I was getting better at creating products worth paying for. \n\nBasically it was the same amount of work selling something for $1 as it was $20, and I learned a lot about how edtech pricing influences outcomes and consumer psychology. \n\nThese days I more or less ‚Äúfinished‚Äù developing and putting passion into that project so I‚Äôve made it free as a value-add and moved onto another product after learning about consumer psychology and edtech resistance, which is language learning. \n\nI haven‚Äôt executed on marketing and sales on it yet but I figure that after everything I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôll generally be easier to convert folks because it‚Äôs more aligned with where my consumer base currently is. I‚Äôm hoping to eventually reach $10k/mo sometime in the next year or two. \n\nWell. Thanks for coming to my ted talk. If you haven‚Äôt any questions I‚Äôm happy to check in and answer them even though I don‚Äôt really use Reddit too often anymore. ",

          "body": "Let me counter your philosophizing with some experience based knowledge.\n\nSo there's this program called **Techstars Startup Weekend**, which is a 3 day business idea hackathon - designed to compress the incubator or accelerator program experience into a single weekend. \n\nOver the past decade **I've led 80 Startup Weekend events** throughout the US, Canada, and Australia. These events attract very interesting people - technical, creative, entrepreneurial, industry experts - you name it. \n\nAt each of these events, I typically hear **40 to 50 business idea pitches** on the first night, then watch around 10 teams of 4-5 people attempt to do customer discovery, build MVPs, and variously execute on these ideas, then finally deliver investor style pitches to panels of judges. Are you doing the math? That's a decent sample size of founders and ideas. \n\nSome of them don't get very far during a single weekend; others finish with functional products and even sales. But most of them at least get through 1 or 2 rounds of customer discovery with real humans (no silly online surveys). And that's where ideas meet the market and real learning begins. That's where founders learn to let go of their \"idea\" for a solution and discover how other people experience the problem they think they're solving. 99% of the time they discover they had made significant false assumptions and their \"idea\" must change or it's unlikely to reliably find paying customers. \n\nIt's their investigation of the problem that surfaces insights into solution ideas and that's where value creation begins to form.\n\nWanna know what I've observed about ideas? \n\nI see the same ideas over and over and over. I've literally listened to thousands of idea pitches, and it's now extremely rare that I hear a new idea. It's fairly common for Startup Weekend attendees to be nervous about sharing their idea. Sometimes they take me aside and tell me about their idea, and why they're afraid someone will steal it. Then I proceed to tell them about several other teams that I've worked with on the same idea, and the things they've learned, what worked and didn't, and it's easy to show them that the best thing they could possibly do is to talk about their idea with a variety of people and try to build a team. \n\n**The team is far more important** than the idea.  \nWith a great team, the idea can change and you'll be able to execute. A great idea is worthless if you don't have a team, or have a bad team. The best way to find great team members is to talk to lots of people about the problem you want to solve and get some awesome people involved. You can't do that by hiding your idea. \n\n**Your idea is not unique.**  \nLook up \"multiple discovery\" or \"simultaneous invention\" and understand that for every idea we have there are hundreds of innovative people around the world having the same idea. As technology and society evolve, all of our creative minds are working on the same problems, with the same tools and limitations. Old problems get solved and create new ones. New problems arise from new circumstances. You're not the only one who noticed. The things that will differentiate between all of the innovators are not the idea itself, but their skills, flexibility, connections, access to resources, etc. \n\nBut... but... you can't find your idea online? You did some Google searches? LOL That's because the other folks working on it have either failed and their stuff isn't online any more, or they've done such a poor job describing it so far that it's hard to search for, or they're working in a different language, and you only searched in English, or they're like you: hiding. But I promise you it's not because your idea is unique. \n\nNow I can tell a hundred stories about people who boldly pitched their idea to a room full of a hundred strangers, formed a team, fell in love with the process, and built a successful company. The people who were too scared to share their idea? ...I never heard of them again.\n\n**Execution Starts with Discovery**  \nPeople love quotes like \"ideas are a dime a dozen...\" but this leaves out something critical. The really important thing is to learn what good execution looks like. It begins by genuinely investigating the problem with real humans, using a method like Steve Blank's Customer Development, or Rob Fitzpatrick's Mom Test. \n\nSo here's a more complete quote, from **Sam Altman**:  \n\n&gt;_\"Ideas themselves are not worth anything,_  \n&gt;_only executing well is what creates value._  \n&gt;_Execution gets divided into two key questions:_  \n&gt;_1. Can you figure out what to do?_  \n&gt;_2. Can you get it done?_\"",

We get Bronze plans because we're in our lower 40s and very healthy.  We are the farthest thing from rich but we're over the 400% of poverty line threshold.  \n\nOur premium now is a manageable $600/mo for a plan with a $15k deductible.  Next year it's estimated to go to $1600 per month.  That's nearly 20% of our income on...nothing.  We get our yearly checkups, and occasionally have to call in about meds for tick bites because we live in a rural area.  \n\nI know lots of people older than us have it way worse too.  People in their 50s and early 60s pay insane amounts for coverage.  Why are we putting up with this???  Just lining the pockets of executives and going broke in the process.  \n\nI know there is talk of extending the enhanced subsidies but I don't really have my hopes up about it.  ",

          "body": "Context: I run my own company. Actually, a couple of them. But I have been a sales guy and technologist (developer) for over 30 years. So I am going to advise you from the perspective of thinking about things strategically.\n\nYour constraints:\n\n1. They are one of your only clients (you are very dependent)\n2. \"Small tweaks\" - not sure if 1 week is a small tweak in your industry?\n3. What you have delivered does not meet their needs/desires - hence the request for small tweaks.\n\nWhat you really want is a conversation to answer the following questions:\n\n1. Does your client see you as disposable and therefore can pressure you to put in a week of work for free?\n2. Are you selling and positioning what you do as high value? In other words is it rare?\n3. Are you exceeding your clients needs? Or are you missing the mark and they believe that they are owed this work because you did not meet their needs?\n4. Can you flip the script to help them understand that you want to keep them as a client, you are high value and you are not desperate.\n5. How do you become so valuable that when they ask for work for free, they believe you are family and therefore every new contract will flow in your direction. In other words, you do this - and I will never leave.\n\nSo how do you answer these questions:\n\n1. Do they know you have very few clients? If so, why are you marketing this idea to them in the first place? You should always be marketing how scarce your time is. Therefore, your time is extremely valuable. I see so many business owners constantly fall into this trap when they are trying to please a client. It demonstrates weakness.\n2. How do you position yourself, do you drop price when they apply pressure? Or do you exchange a discount for other concessions from them?\n3. Ask the question as follows - \"Hey xyz - I realize that you all need these 'small tweaks' and we want you to be completely satisfied with the finished product. I do have some questions so we can improve our work product moving forward. The small tweaks you are asking for is a week of work on our side which is 20k/30k whatever it happens to be. The money is not an issue. You all are a fantastic client. However, when you require additional work pro bono (do not say free), it typically means we (you are taking responsibility) missed the mark. Where do you think we went wrong?\" This is an open ended question and allows the client to really think about what they are asking for. Maybe they even realize that they could have done things better.\"\n4. After question 3 is answered, and this is forward looking - \"I just took on a few new clients and we are hiring some additional folks. You are our top priority given our abc years together. So don't worry, we will make things happen. However, I am going to need some flexibility as we ramp.\" Yes this is bullshit. But guess what - a) you need to ramp and get some new clients so this never happens again. b) you create scarcity and he/she realizes you are the hot girl at the bar/club. It forces them to recalibrate. It also gives you time to work on getting new clients instead of putting all your time into free work. Which is a real problem in the consulting business. If you are fulfilling contracts, you are not selling. You need to either hire someone to do the work, or hire someone to sell if you never want to be here again.\n5. \"hey xyz - glad we are on the same page. What new initiatives are you planning?\" You just gave them 1 week of free work. He/she owes you. This is the time to ask for that work to be handed to you.\n\nHope this helps.",

This is a less common but highly profitable way. You can cross sell therefore to add clientele to your books and increase profitability across both (if it is within your ability to do.

If you do it once, they will come to expect it. You will start doing it for other clients. Any referred business will come to expect it. Doing free work is a race to the bottom, and there's only one closer. You.\n\nYou can't make up a loss with volume. I learned this the hard way. I had to fire several long-time clients because I was losing too much money keeping them all happy.\n\n&gt;2. Based on your experience, what would you do if you were me right now?\n\nSay no. Explain that this is out of the scope of the original project (you have a contract, right???). At most, offer them a discount because you didn't set expectations properly.\n\nFor future reference, this is a you problem. Set expectations on scope creep so there is no question what the client is due and what they will pay extra for. Include a detailed scope of work in the contract.\n\nAs a side note, a week of work is NOT a couple of tweaks in any world. Even if you only bill $50/hr, that's still $2000 of labor.",

I'm talking about sole props that take home 40-100k a year.\n\nThe consensus among them seems to be that being self employed is somehow \"riskier\" than being employed.\n\nBut even if you have been in business 10 years and have proven successful, you are still seen as risky.\n\nThe other thing that irritates me is they all want to go off your tax returns and not your bank statements.\n\nA lot of things are legally written off. Mileage, cost of goods, you name it. Some of these are expenses, some aren't.\n\nIf regularly employed folks were allowed to deduct their meals, mileage, cell phone bill, work uniforms, etc then their income would appear lower as well.  \n\nBut they still only look at adjusted gross income or AGI. \n\nEven if you made $70,000 and only had $20,000 in actual expenses, but legally wrote off another $30k in deductions (just an example), your AGI is only $20,000 which isn't very much.\n\nIf you took home $70k working for a company, but spent $20k on travel expenses, mileage, meals, cell phone, internet, uniforms, work shoes, tools, you name it, the bank STILL only looks at that $70k figure.\n\nHow on earth is that fair? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

These companies employ actuaries who draw from massive historical data to determine risk levels for insurance premiums and loan rates.  So they look at all the loans ever given and focus down on self employed people and see higher rates of default.  It's just that simple.  \n\nLet's say you get cancer, 1 in 12 adults in the US get this news every year.  You work for a major company with good benefits and you get PTO for care visits, high quality insurance, and FMLA benefits from an insurance company that pays you partial income while you are completely incapacitated.  If you die you also have a term life plan provided by your employer.  If a bank loans this guy money the chances that he lives long enough and has the income to pay the loan back are pretty good.  \n\nIf they loan you money and you're a $60k a year sole prop doing physical labor with no disability or workman's comp insurance they are taking on several orders of magnitude more risk.  So much risk they would rather avoid lending to you at all.  They know you're one bad day away from never being able to pay them.  You may disagree but they don't care.  \n\nIt's unfair and life sucks.  Welcome to rugged individualism in a capitalist society.  Good luck out there.",

I guess the moral of the story is not to try to boil the ocean, take it slow, build your business and go from there.",

I always wanted to start a REAL business though, so I watched some videos and vending machines seemed like a good idea and something real. So I found a couple locations and put about 7k into it (buying the machines). It was scary af, I had no idea what I was doing but cant learn if you dont try. Well, I got them set up and ran them for 6 months, I didn't like it so I sold them and made a small good profit. Then I made a Etsy shop and did very well for a few years, trying different products and found a couple things that sold VERY well. By that time I had enough saved up to buy my first investment property, so I did that, still scared af and had no idea what I was doing....\n\nYou just have to start somewhere, if you are smart and do it the right way, it's kinda hard to lose money. You will learn a ton and find out what you like and dont like. I always suggest starting small and growing slowly. The real trick is, you just have to start!",

Any questions you‚Äôre confused about, just google it and there will be a layman‚Äôs term translation (might be more tax advantageous to start it in another state for the sake of simplicity just do your own state)\n\n- after you get your articles of incorporation, go to IRS website and apply for EIN (another quick process) \n\n- then get a business license from your city. You should be able to apply online at your local .gov. You can the local licensing division to get assistance \n\n- then get a business bank account from a bank of your choosing\n\n- Lastly, sign up for a free bookkeeping/invoicing site like Wave. Bookkeeping and knowing your numbers is CRITICAL. The earlier you set your books up, the easier/cleaner it will be.\n\nAfter your legal presence is established, next you want to establish an online presence so that you can easily market &amp; feel like a ‚Äúreal business.‚Äù \n\n- Use canva to create a simple logo and a few starter images for marketing purposes\n\n- Set up social media pages (Facebook, tik tok, IG being the main ones)\n\n- start a website and use same language &amp; pictures from social media pages (be consistent across all platforms)\n\n- start a google business page \n\nThis process of creating/setting up always helps me form my marketing vision &amp; taglines vs sitting down with a business plan and writing out ideas. \n\nThis next part is arguable because many people say leave family &amp; friends out of it but not me. Once you have legal &amp; online presence, tell your close family &amp; friends that you‚Äôve started a business &amp; ask them to follow your social media pages. \n\nThen ask them to be your first customers. I‚Äôve only done service based businesses, so I generally ask them if I can do a quick service for them at a discounted rate. This accomplishes several things:\n- legal paying customers\n- capture pictures &amp; videos while you do the job for them so you have more content for your online pages\n- request five star reviews from all of them &amp; quickly grow your reputation (technically you can skip to this part and just request reviews but morally speaking it‚Äôs better if they are actual customers) \n\nThen sign up for different leads/marketplace platforms depending on your line of business. If you sell products, then a site like Etsy is a good one. Service businesses can use pay-per-lead  sites like Thumbtack, Angis, Bark, or Yelp (but beware of these; there are legit leads/customers to be had but a lot of scam leads and/or no response).\n\nThen you can graduate to Google, Facebook &amp; IG ads &amp; campaigns.\n\nI personally don‚Äôt start to fill out an actual business plan until I‚Äôve done most of the above. I find it‚Äôs easier to actually complete the business plan after I‚Äôve done the initial setup. Lots more I could add but I think that‚Äôs a good starting point. Hope this helps. Message me if you want to discuss more. Good luck!",

Is it because you hate your day job and believe having your own business will be better?\n\nThe reason I ask is because if have done several businesses and side hustles, most didn't do well and some did excellent. But it was more so what I've learned over time.\n\nThe ones that did really well were some that I was very passionate about and good at. All the ones that tanked were ideas that I wanted to do and looked at as a side hustle, and I thought I could just throw out there and win.\n\nBusiness is challenging, and it requires a specific mindset to succeed in it. Just because you want to doesn't mean you should, and because you should doesn't mean you can. What I mean by that is I've seen countless posts like yours and those from small business owners. I am really passionate about entrepreneurship, BTW, that's why I hang out here. That raises fundamental questions, but then you can see that they are stuck on certain things, and it sometimes explains why they are struggling and not performing well.\n\nHow much do you educate yourself? How dedicated are you to learning new things?\n\nHere an example of where I am getting at:\n\nLet's say you are an excellent chef, and your food is killing it and can compete with the best of them. Does it mean you will be successful with your restaurant? No, not at all\n\nPrimarily, running a restaurant entails 80% of tasks and responsibilities that have nothing to do with the food itself. You need to know accounting, budgeting, marketing, managing people, logistics, customer service, strategy, etc. Those are the things that make or break people. Your product (food) is just your beginning and why, but your how is what makes it happen.\n\nMost people's why is they just want to make money or hate their job, that's not good enough. So understand your why and what, then you can figure out your how. If you why is, I am really good a repairing cars and I love it, gives you your starting basis for your how, now you can focus on how you will set yourself apart from others.",

Yeah ...no. \n\nEvery wantrepreneur knows you don't need money to start. Every businessperson knows the top reason you will *end that business* is running out of money. It is the difference between half-truth and whole truth. \n\nThey all whine about future regret. How a half-assed fling alleviates a sense of regret is the only mystery about the outcome.",

I had to build mine in 2016, when orders from Amazon and Flipkart suffered. \n\nWe only bought a domain and hosting with cpanel, the cheapest as we can spend more if the website takes off.\nThe store was done with prestashop and then months later redone with magento. These were single click install available for free in the hosting cpanel. We also made many subdomain for the team to experiment and play with the many other tools available there.\n\nAfter the single click install, it was just form filling about your data . The product pages were easy for us, as we had a catalog due to our existing Ecom. The rest were the terms page, about us, and many such . \n\nSince we wanted to launch and test the waters first, we did not integrate any shipping provider with the website. We just manually entered the tracking details and sent it to the customer also.\nThen was getting a payment integrator. It's a simple process too. You will need to provide tax details and kyc to the payments processor for this.\n\nFor the https certificates, we used a free 90 day renewal certificate.

Luckily I had Northwest Registered Agent do all my paperwork, but here's the kicker. I called one day to follow up on one of the filings and the rep told me they could secure the domain and build the website for free. Which was friggin awesome cause I didn't have thousands of dollars to invest in getting a website done, I just wanted to get up and running. So they built me a landing page and then I had their tech support help me connect my Shopify to it. I gave them the logo and business info and they did all the heavy lifting, cause if it was up to me, I'd still be banging my head on the desk trying to figure out what a DNS record is. Your business might be different but it actually saved me a ton of work. Idk if they're still running that special but it might be worth it to at least call and ask some questions.

In fact, some of the people who ghosted me originally became cool with me again after I told them I‚Äôd ‚Äúexaggerated‚Äù my story the first time around.\n\nIt made me realize how unpredictable people‚Äôs reactions can be when you reconnect after years. I thought sharing positive news about business success would be encouraging, but in reality it sometimes made old friends uncomfortable.

Sometimes keeping it simple and focusing on old memories is the better way to reconnect. This kinda reminds me of how some lottery winners have stories of suddenly finding a few of their friends and family members to be resentful of them after winning.\n\n#Edit:\n\nI run a one man web design business where small mom and pop shops and blue collar businesses pay a small fee each month to manage their company websites.

Just a little something that lays out your ideas and goals, who you think your customers may be, what problem you are solving, how you plan on reaching your customers, and what it might cost you to get started. Then start by testing your idea small. You can learn in real time without breaking the bank. This will also give you feedback from your test customers to drive your product upgrades to what actually works. Once things start to take off, you then can invest more and expand as you go.",

Sure that stuff can be done but it‚Äôs probably half a days work at best. The hard part is narrowing down how you‚Äôre going to make money, and I highly suggest finding something residual. My wealthiest clients are usually the plumber business owner, a street sweeping company, electrical business owners, etc. they start small, one truck or van, then expand, then buy a small mom and pop if they get lucky, they work hard at their businesses and very often becomes a part of them, like their child. But it starts with figuring out what you like, what you want to spend your time doing, and how quickly you can get to making a reasonable profit so you can stop your day job if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre in. The freedom a business owner is very liberating. Don‚Äôt let the first ‚Äústep‚Äù or the ‚Äúhow‚Äù slow you down. Just get rolling and figure it out along the way.

I'm still limited to pickup orders due to some issues so posts will remain sporadic for the foreseeable future. I did spot some really nice looking rebates on Swagbucks though so I might have to force myself to go into the store sometime. We'll see.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with those Dave's Oat Bars. I'm usually iffy on whether I like oat bars, but these ones are really soft but still have some texture from the whole oats. Really tasty too. I hope the rebate comes back.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n----\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###Time Spent\n\nI did not track my time spent. Due to some issues, planning and doing hauls right now is incredibly difficult, and I have to take a lot of breaks. My pickup orders only take like 5 minutes to get though.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI generally plan my hauls over the course of an hour or two while I eat breakfast/lunch and play with my pets.\n\nI usually spend around 45-70 minutes in the store, which includes my regular grocery shopping. I could easily cut that down to 30-45 but I like to take my time.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n----\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n###Food From Deals\n\nHere's some things I've made in the past: [High Protein Tomato Crackers](https://imgur.com/a/A9hdce7), [Hot Sausage Cups](https://imgur.com/a/pIHSYJg), [Peanut Butter Fudge &amp; Chocolate Hazelnut Fudge](https://imgur.com/a/GT2gd2S), [Chocolate Cherry Pie](https://imgur.com/a/9S5p6U6)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDo you guys want me to continue showing things I've made using ingredients I got from rebate apps on these posts? Let me know in the comments, or [you can vote on this poll if you want to remain anonymous](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdUuN8QZj1FvCrMbZPcSs4eI1oK1zAV2saVxICelox-dqg_JQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n----\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###Mini FAQ\n\n* If you're new or confused - check out the guides near the top of the post. They go into detail about *everything*.\n\n* I'm from the USA and these posts are tailored as such, but [this post of mine](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mikazah/comments/1ma1xxx/want_to_get_paid_to_buy_groceries_gas_and_other/) does list things from other countries that I know about. \n\n* My posts are tailored to being money makers to suit this subreddit. There are tons of great deals that aren't money makers but can still save you a lot of money. \n\n* A lot of what I get is given away to friends, family or is donated. I do this more as a hobby than anything.\n\n* I generally do not share my spreadsheet since the one shown in this post is not the one I actually use (it's put together with a script from my usual spreadsheet) and there are a ton of little things that will give you wrong values if you don't know about them and even then you have to be careful. It's super easy to make a spreadsheet with Google Sheets though.",
