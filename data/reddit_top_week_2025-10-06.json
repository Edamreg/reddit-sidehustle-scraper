It honestly surprised me the first time I made a little money from one of them, since I never considered those skills worth much. Over time it added up, and that extra money plus a win on rollingriches even helped me buy my dream car something I never thought those small skills could lead to. Do any of you have side hustles where you‚Äôve managed to turn small or useless skills into actual income?",

      "selftext": "Those first couple of days on Etsy were rough. I had a shop set up, listings live, but the dashboard just sat there... no traffic, no favorites, no sales. I kept refreshing like a maniac, half-convinced nobody would ever find me.\n\nI didn‚Äôt bother wasting money on ads or trying to decode a bunch of SEO guides. Instead, I got curious and opened Twitter. Typed ‚ÄúEtsy‚Äù into search, switched to the Latest tab, and scrolled. Most of it was noise, but I started filtering for tweets that had 100+ reposts.\n\nThe thing that stood out? It wasn‚Äôt the big accounts going viral, they always do. It was the small ones. When someone with a couple thousand followers posted about a random Etsy product and it blew up, that meant the idea itself was hot.\n\nI caught one of those signals, pulled it up on HeyEtsy to see if people were actually buying, and sure enough the listings had fresh traffic. That was enough for me. I mocked up a quick version in Canva, listed it without overthinking, and walked away.\n\nTwo days later... cha-ching. My first sale. It didn‚Äôt make me rich, but it proved the shop wasn‚Äôt invisible. More than that, it showed me I didn‚Äôt have to sit around guessing products or wait forever for SEO to kick in.\n\nSince then, I‚Äôve kept the same little habit: spot what‚Äôs buzzing outside Etsy, double-check demand, and throw something up fast. Not perfect, but it works.\n\nAnyone else stumbled into their first sale in a weird way like this?",

Starting to think I need to explore other markets or go online.  \nSo here's what I'm trying to figure out. Do I take the clothing thing online to Poshmark or Ebay and try scaling that way?

I'd waste hours scrolling listings while other resellers grabbed everything first. Ended up using this search software called ubuyfirst (or else can't remember exactly). It's basically built for people buying inventory consistently on ebay which alerts you when new listings drop and organizes everything so you can make decisions way faster than the next buyer.  \n  \nFor vintage clothing I'd test ebay since the buyer pool is huge.

I'm convinced there's not a single person checking that account. \n\nI emailed them 2 or 3 more times after, but nothing. I still had hope though; I could still see the invoices on the Oneforma page, showing up as \"ready to pay\". \n\nRecently though, I opened the website again, and to my surprise, I found they've redesigned it. And when checking the payments tab, all the old payments are gone. Both the ones that did get paid, and those that I never got. So now I don't really have any proof other than some PO IDs and screenshots of the project manager showing part of what I was supposed to be paid for the month of June. But then again, I don't think proof matters when they completely ignore your emails.\n\nSorry for the rant. Has anyone had an issue like this, and if so did you manage to solve it? I've honestly resigned myself to the fact I'm not ever seeing that money, but I'd like to know if there is a chance. Thank you.",

I was happy as apple pie with ice cream on a hot day until I saw the pay. \n\n$6-$18 per hour, 40 hours a week, 10 hours a day based on experience. \n\nSIX DOLLARS AN HOUR? Last time I checked, it wasn't 1970. Federal minimum wage is $7.25/hour. So they're definitely acting illegally. Now I don't know if I should even trust this company at all! Six dollars an hour. Holy moses, that's a red flag and criminal. Also on the site I chose work from home. 700 jobs show up and most all are hybrid. That is NOT 'remote' in my opinion. Telus should put hybrid jobs under a hybrid tag and remote jobs (meaning 100% work from home) under a remote tag. This is disheartening. I was really thrilled I'd maybe finally have my first ever work from home job. I'll keep looking. But what do you all think? $6 an hour?!\n\nEdit: apologies.

      "selftext": "We [managed to cross $1k MRR](https://x.com/onlinedopamine/status/1958544915966861629) with our startup 4.5 months into launching the product, so I wanted to use this post as a way to reflect on what has been working and what hasn't. \n\nQuick aside: this is the first time I ever had a SaaS that makes four digits. Launched 4 before (2 still active). Did all of this while working a regular full-time job. \n\nHere are all the marketing hacks that moved the needle:\n\n1. Build in public. \n\nYes, nothing revolutionary here. We're in the B2B space (or prosumer at the very least) and I do believe it helps if people know you. \n\nPersonally, I don't even publish that much about our startup (since there isn't something super exciting happening all the time) to not come off as salesy. Instead, just sharing tidbits about my life, things I find interesting, opinions I have, places I travel to, and so forth. \n\nJust be a normal human being and realize that post people, especially on social media, don't actually care much about your business (at least not to the extent they care about you as a person). \n\nPieter (Levels), I find, does this exceptionally well. Maybe every 5-6th of his posts is about a product of his and he mostly just talks about things he finds interesting. \n\n2. Case studies\n\nI wanted to mention this as a separate point, even though it's utilizing the same platforms (X and Threads). \n\nIn our case, I share successful slideshows other accounts publish on TikTok, detailing the copy they use, the products they promote, influencers they work with, and such. \n\nThis is the part where we deliberately target our ICP - and where we see the highest ROI in terms of conversions. \n\nIntuitively, that somewhat makes sense. Many in the app space, for example, are still somewhat unaware of the benefits of slideshows, so seeing successful examples (and how you can replicate them) is oftentimes all the inspiration you need to get started. \n\n3. Building what our competitors are missing\n\nThere's one competitor in our product category who sucks up most of the oxygen (since he was the first to launch a product in the category). \n\nHowever, his product is still missing tons of essential features. So, we simply built those (e.g., workspace &amp; team features) based on customer queries. \n\nAgain, this also ties back into point 1. Those prospective customers wouldn't have found us if it wasn't for building in public. And then we executed quickly once they did. \n\n4. Experiment with pricing\n\nWe initially started with a simple subscription like anyone does. However, what we soon realized talking to our users is that many don't want to pay for and use all of the features our product offers. \n\nAs a result, we introduced a credit-based system and split up our plans into four distinct tiers, with one plan only offering the most basic of features (so that customers can then top up with credits if they need access to any of the other features). \n\nAnd now some of our customers actually spend hundreds of $$$ just on credits while still being on the cheapest tier. \n\n5. Message your competitor's customers\n\nOur main competitor is pretty active on socials, so every time he'd post, we simply would send a message to all the people who replied. \n\nIt works really well if you take point 3 serious and can use those differentiating features as the baseline for your message (e.g., \"Hey, I saw that you use x, I work on y and we have the following features abc that you may find interesting). \n\nI feel like way too many indie hackers want to play nice, be liked, and don't step on anyone's toes. \n\nThis is a business you're trying to run after all, so be as brazen as you humanly can. \n\n6. YouTube\n\nIronically, as I am typing this, our YouTube channel just got banned lol. This one hurts because it had been converting super well, especially considering the still fairly low amount of views. \n\nThe simple reason is intent. We mostly did search-based videos (e.g., people looking for how to do xyz), which meant that intent is super high.\n\nThe great thing about search-based YouTube is that those videos also tend to rank for a long time (as people keep searching for that keyword). \n\nHopefully we can get our channel back because it was actually the acquisition channel I was excited the most for and spending a substantial amount of time on. \n\n  \n\\--- \n\nIf you guys have any questions, feel free to ask away :)  \n",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone. For context, we‚Äôve been running internal benchmark research to see how different promotions affect sales and engagement. One trap that keeps popping up is that vendors have trained customers to a certain behavior. And it backfires. What I mean is that when people want something in a $$$-$$$$$ range, they just wait for the next big sale. Black Friday, mid-season, clearance, whatever ‚Äî they know patience pays.\n\nSo the obvious question: what‚Äôs the alternative? We‚Äôve seen brands testing widgets with bundles, gifts for purchase, free shipping, loyalty rewards, etc. Some of these help margins and engagement, but the numbers are mixed.\n\nBundles work for AOV, but feel forced, especially if a customer doesn't really need the second item. Gifts are great, but you attract freebie hunters who buy just for the bonus. Loyalty programs are just too slow to show results, and people want quick wins.\n\nWhatever you choose, it‚Äôs like trying to outrun Beyonc√© at the Grammys. However, one lever we‚Äôve seen working better than others is free shipping thresholds. Shoppers hate paying for delivery, so they‚Äôre more likely to add extra items to the cart just to cross the line. Psychologically, it trains shoppers‚Äô behavior in a way that actually encourages paying, rather than waiting for discounts.\n\nFor the sake of research (and curiosity), have you guys found anything that can compete with -50% off in terms of conversion and profitability?\n\n",

          "body": "You‚Äôre right about discount conditioning. What‚Äôs worked best for me when we wanted Black-Friday-level conversion without torching margin:\n\n1. Shipping threshold tuned to the 70th‚Äì80th percentile cart. If your median cart is 42 and p80 is 58, set free shipping at 55‚Äì60. This reliably bumps AOV without training people to wait.\n2. Choice bundles, not forced kits. Let buyers pick any 2 or 3 from a curated set and auto-apply a small step discount. Perceived control beats bigger blanket cuts and returns stay lower.\n3. Store credit instead of percent off. Example: spend 60, get 10 store credit that activates in 14 days. You protect margin now and pull a second purchase later.\n4. Limited value adds that cost you pennies but feel premium. Examples: extended warranty, priority handling, sample sizes, engraving, install help. These attract fewer freebie hunters than high-value gifts.\n5. Private promos to warm audiences only. Email, SMS, loyalty tiers. Public site stays full price so you don‚Äôt anchor future traffic to sales.\n6. Creator or affiliate bonuses that stack as a value add, not a price cut. Let partners include their mini course, template, or preset pack with your product via unique codes. Conversion pop without training for minus fifty.\n7. Price integrity play. Keep list price stable, run fast 48-hour campaigns on specific outcomes instead of storewide sales. Example: ‚ÄúWorkspace refresh event‚Äù with free desk mat plus credit on organizers. Clear theme beats generic discounts.\n\nMeasure with holdouts. Optimize thresholds quarterly, not weekly. The only things I‚Äôve seen truly compete with 50 percent off are shipping thresholds plus credit-back mechanics, because they increase willingness to pay today and bring people back later.",

Could I, relying only on my past experience, once again take a store from 0 to 100K profitably and without overcomplicating it. I wanted to motivate beginners, prove the ‚Äúdropshipping is dead‚Äù crowd wrong, and take a jab at the wannabe gurus who promise flying Lambos, threesomes with Sydney Sweeney and Emily Ratajkowski, and instant success just by manifesting it.\n\nBack then I even promised that once the store hit 100K I would give it away to someone here. Shame on me, that never happened. And there are reasons. First, I was honestly shocked by how many store flippers are lurking here, ready to acquire and resell sites to who knows who and at what price.\n\nSecond, the ‚Äúhey bro just give me the store‚Äù messages kept coming for weeks and months, often from people who clearly had no clue about even the basic foundations of dropshipping, and that was a huge turn off for me.\n\nSo instead of giving the store away and shutting it down, I just kept growing it. Now after $1M in sales I decided, with the help of my former mentor, to use it as an open free case study.\n\nSo, here is what we covered so far:  \n‚Ä¢ How to build a professional looking store with free themes, free graphic resources and free apps  \n‚Ä¢ How to connect it properly with payment methods and social accounts  \n‚Ä¢ How to acquire payment processors and keep them \"alive\"  \n‚Ä¢ Learning about niches, which ones are the most lucrative and why  \n‚Ä¢ How to properly do product research and quickly find completely untapped products, showing our own unique methods  \n‚Ä¢ How to run Meta Ads and stay profitable in today‚Äôs Andromeda chaos, covering everything from ad copy, creatives, campaign setup, metrics, product testing, scaling, and making a bulletproof system in case of ad account shutdowns  \n‚Ä¢ How to run Google Ads, covering basically the same topics as on Meta  \n‚Ä¢ How to run a Shopify store, focusing on the technical side of it, covering everything from fulfilment of orders to store redesigns for events like Black Friday and more  \n‚Ä¢ How to do customer support, which no one likes to talk about but is just as important as product research and marketing\n\nWhat is still in the works:  \n‚Ä¢ Fighting and winning chargebacks  \n‚Ä¢ TikTok marketing\n\nAll of you are invited to participate so we can finally create something valuable and free, something that we can all learn from. I truly believe this industry, with the flood of AI tools and everything moving online, will only become easier to manage and more lucrative in the future.\n\nAnd yes, happy beginning of Q4. That‚Äôs all from me for now brothers and sisters, talk to you soon.",

It signals a lack of validation, making them less likely to trust your advice, click your affiliate links, or spend more time on your site. This high bounce rate and low engagement then tell Google your page is low-quality, creating a vicious cycle that stifles your ranking potential.\n\nThe real game isn't just about getting the click; it's about winning the trust once they land. Social proof isn't a vanity metric; it's a credibility signal for both users and algorithms. A page that looks active and discussed simply performs better.\n\nMy own sites didn't gain traction until I started treating social validation as a core part of my launch strategy for key articles. Using a service like Viral Rabbi to seed that initial, foundational layer of engagement was the catalyst. It made my content look established and trustworthy, which kept real users on the page longer. Google noticed the improved metrics, and the organic growth finally followed.

I‚Äôm doing about $15k-30K/month in business revenue with roughly a 50-70% profit margin depending on the month.\n\nMy wife is a full-time student and works part time, but has seen the earning potential of my business first hand and would like to try her hand at running a business.\n\nPoint blank, she‚Äôs a hell of a lot smarter than I am but I‚Äôm willing to work 16 hour days, 365 days a year and do quite literally anything necessary to make my business successful. I‚Äôve got two brain cells, a hell of a lot of grit, and healthy risk tolerance.\n\nMy wife is a great employee and straight A student. However, she has trouble starting new things and sticking to them unless there‚Äôs social pressure to do so. She‚Äôs also risk averse so some of the loans I‚Äôve taken out for my business just about gave her a heart attack.\n\nShe wants me to help fund her business startup costs (which is only a few thousand so nothing I can‚Äôt stand to lose), make her a website, create marketing materials, and get leads coming in. I can do all of these things, but I‚Äôm worried that by doing so, she won‚Äôt learn about marketing or take ownership of the business.\n\nI want to be supportive of her and I‚Äôm going to fund the initiative regardless, but do you have any advice on how to navigate this situation so that she feels responsible for the business and takes ownership of it?",

From a purely financial view, if she was not your wife it would not make sense to invest in an entrepreneur who cannot stick to things and cannot setup a website.\n\n\nSo that brings us to the marriage side of things. You should expect that any time or money you spend on this business is going to be a net loss. So this is a gift to your wife to try and make her happy. From that viewpoint I recommend only helping her when she asks and making sure that you do not mess up your main business for this new business that will likely fail. Do not jump in and try to make her business succeed. Just expect failure, do just enough to make her a bit happier, and make sure your main business keeps working",

      "selftext": "A few months ago, I had an idea I couldn‚Äôt shake. The problem was familiar: every time I‚Äôve had an idea in the past, I either got stuck in analysis paralysis or went down the rabbit hole of coding, logos, product names, and all the ‚Äúfun‚Äù distractions. Weeks or months would pass before I showed it to anyone, and by then I usually lost steam or realised nobody wanted it.\n\nThis time, I forced myself to do the opposite. My goal was simple: could I get strangers to care about my idea in less than a weekend? No product, no backend, no fancy branding. Just the bare minimum to test the interest.\n\nSo I worked on creating a landing page. To get people onto the page, I did two things. First, I shared it in a couple of communities where I knew the target audience hang out. Second, I put about $250 into very small ads just to see if anyone outside my personal network would click through. Nothing fancy.\n\nThe results surprised me. In 4 days, about 220 people visited the page. 63 of them actually signed up. That‚Äôs almost 30%. And a few of those people even replied to the confirmation email I sent, asking me questions about the idea and saying they‚Äôd pay for something like this if it existed. That was the kind of signal I never got from building in a vacuum.\n\nWas it perfect? No. But it gave me more validation in two days than months of building ever had. And honestly, it took the pressure off. Instead of wondering ‚Äúdoes anyone want this?‚Äù I could move forward knowing at least a small group of people had raised their hands.\n\nSo if you‚Äôre sitting on an idea and spinning your wheels, don‚Äôt overthink it. Write down the problem clearly, describe how you‚Äôd solve it, and put up a simple landing page with a signup form. Drive a little traffic and watch what happens. Even if you only get a handful of signups, that‚Äôs still real feedback from real people.",

Just me figuring it out, messing it up, and trying again.\n\nThis week my dashboard rolled over the $480,000 mark in total revenue (I know it's a pretty specific milestone number but [4 &amp; 8] are my favorite numbers, haha). It didn‚Äôt come fast. The first year I made $0-$500 for 9 months. I was SO CLOSE to quitting after a string of chargebacks. A contractor ghosted me LITERALLY mid project and I had to refund work I couldn‚Äôt afford to refund. I still take calls from a cheap desk in my second bathroom (that I never used and converted over into an office)...\n\nI know this isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmade it‚Äù / retirement money and I‚Äôm not trying to sell anything. I just needed to say it somewhere so people understand what it costs to get even this far. The late nights. The ‚Äúis this stupid?‚Äù loop. The quiet wins nobody sees. I promise you it pays off no matter how much you don't get it\n\nIf you‚Äôre early: keep building those fundamental structure points.. If you‚Äôre further along: RESPECT!\n\n Today I‚Äôm just letting myself feel proud for a second, then it‚Äôs back to grind.\n\nNo links, no pitch, no \"click on my profile\" hidden motive BS.. \n\njust sharing a moment with folks who get it...\n\nEdit: Wow, I wasn‚Äôt expecting this much feedback haha. Appreciate everyone who took the time to comment. For anyone wondering how it started, my first few clients came from straight cold outreach emails and calls (my gf handled the emails while I handled the calls) until someone finally said yes. Nothing fancy, just persistence. And if your quality matches that persistence then most the time you can count word of mouth as a big source of your business. \n\nSIDENOTE: IF YOU'RE ABLE TO FIND DECENT QUALITY SALES REPRESENTATIVES WILLING TO WORK FOR COMMISSION.. it really paid off for me and can really help speed along that process. My mother always told me that one head is good but two heads is better, but I think ten heads is even better than that and so on and so forth ... Obviously it's not mandatory but in my case it really helped me cover more ground than I would have been able to, alone.",

          "body": "Reading your story really hits home because I‚Äôve faced similar long, uphill climbs where progress felt slow and full of setbacks like chargebacks and unreliable contractors. There‚Äôs so much unseen grinding behind every milestone like yours, the endless late nights and moments of doubt I can relate to deeply. I remember turning my own spare corner of a home into an office, hustling with cold outreach and second-guessing decisions, yet inching forward with persistence and learning. The way you kept the faith, stuck to fundamentals, and eventually built a system that brought consistent revenue is exactly what many entrepreneurs aspire to but few capture in words so honestly.\n\nOne practical thought is your insight about commission-based sales reps, which can exponentially expand reach and lighten your load when you‚Äôre ready to scale beyond solo efforts. Persistence coupled with quality work becomes magnetic, you build momentum that sustains the grind. Celebrate this $480K with pride, it‚Äôs a testament to your resilience and smart hustle, and let it fuel the next phase of growth. I coach entrepreneurs through these stages of hard-won success and scaling, helping them build teams and systems to multiply impact while maintaining what they‚Äôve crafted. Your story encourages anyone stuck in the grind to keep putting one step forward, because those quiet wins truly do pay off.\n\nAustin Erkl - Entrepreneur Coach",

      "selftext": "If youve been running ads for eCommerce, SaaS, or mobile apps you probably realized Meta ad performance has been abysmal the past year.\n\nWe used to grow eCommerce brands primarily with meta ads but CPMs just kept rising and conversions kept decreasing. And this was BEFORE the latest andromeda update.\n\nAnyways here‚Äôs how we took a Canadian eCommerce brand from $80k in April to over $300k (CAD) in June. They sell sleepwear but this approach also works for B2C SaaS, record labels &amp; mobile apps.\n\nHope this helps even one person ahead of Q4.\n\nHere are the exact steps:\n\n1. Get a bunch of US phones with TikTok then scroll the explore page and like things in your niche. Search for related hashtags, then engage with the videos so your feed is personalized.\n\n2. Prepare a TON of videos by replicating what you see on your #foryou page. Literally copy and redo the videos and follow formats that are already proven to work. This can be as simple as a 20 second video with a caption over it and a viral song. Don‚Äôt overthink it! For eCommerce also carousels work really well.\n\n3. By using up to 5 hashtags (like #foryou and #explore and niche ones) we get way more views. Also showing human faces, even if AI generated, helps a lot.\n\n4. Then just post like crazy and DON‚ÄôT stop consistent uploads. We posted almost 1,000 videos between April and June. Average view per video was 16k views but that meant some were 800 views and some were 2m.\n\n5. Don‚Äôt put all your hopes on any 1 video. It‚Äôs a numbers game. We posted an average of 16 videos a day across 8 pages. For the first 15 days things looked bleak and it was barely breakeven. Then by day 41 we hit a viral winner. 4 days later another one because once you go viral once on a specific topic / brand it‚Äôs easier to get views. There‚Äôs more awareness around it now.\n\n6. Just keep it simple and rinse and repeat. This beats dumping all your money into Meta and hoping the algorithm treats you well. Also our viral videos ended up becoming some of the top ads for this brand who reused them in paid campaigns.\n\nIf anyone has questions, ask away. Good luck in Q4 everyone!",

We get Bronze plans because we're in our lower 40s and very healthy.  We are the farthest thing from rich but we're over the 400% of poverty line threshold.  \n\nOur premium now is a manageable $600/mo for a plan with a $15k deductible.  Next year it's estimated to go to $1600 per month.  That's nearly 20% of our income on...nothing.  We get our yearly checkups, and occasionally have to call in about meds for tick bites because we live in a rural area.  \n\nI know lots of people older than us have it way worse too.  People in their 50s and early 60s pay insane amounts for coverage.  Why are we putting up with this???  Just lining the pockets of executives and going broke in the process.  \n\nI know there is talk of extending the enhanced subsidies but I don't really have my hopes up about it.  ",

Oh that‚Äôs right it went up 22% last year so this year the 2% increase seems like I‚Äôm getting a gift but I have to look at it over a few years period of time.\n\nOne healthcare provider pointed out one thing that‚Äôs really screwing up healthcare right now, other than higher prescription drug costs than others might pay and more people being on prescriptions \n\n\nBut he pointed out that during Covid fewer people went to the doctor and that‚Äôs having a little bit of a lagging effect on claims today, where there were actually fewer claims during those few years thus less to pass on to consumers‚Ä¶ which health insurance prices low\n\nBut now it‚Äôs biting us in the ass",

      "selftext": "My biggest client emailed asking for \"small tweaks\". Other than the fact that this is out of scope, it's also a week of work.\n\nI know the usual advice: \"Just say no\" or \"get more clients\". But I can't be the only one who finds it tough when they're most of your income. I feel stuck.\n\nI'm leaning towards just doing the work to keep them happy, even though I have a feeling it's a mistake.\n\nSo, I have two questions for you:\n\n1. For those who have done the free work in a similar spot, how did it turn out?\n2. Based on your experience, what would you do if you were me right now?\n\n",

Not only are you losing out on that pay, but think about the opportunity cost. You could be servicing other clients who will pay. \n\nIf they extend your contract with them, you can always give them some work for free but raise prices on future work.

          "body": "Context: I run my own company. Actually, a couple of them. But I have been a sales guy and technologist (developer) for over 30 years. So I am going to advise you from the perspective of thinking about things strategically.\n\nYour constraints:\n\n1. They are one of your only clients (you are very dependent)\n2. \"Small tweaks\" - not sure if 1 week is a small tweak in your industry?\n3. What you have delivered does not meet their needs/desires - hence the request for small tweaks.\n\nWhat you really want is a conversation to answer the following questions:\n\n1. Does your client see you as disposable and therefore can pressure you to put in a week of work for free?\n2. Are you selling and positioning what you do as high value? In other words is it rare?\n3. Are you exceeding your clients needs? Or are you missing the mark and they believe that they are owed this work because you did not meet their needs?\n4. Can you flip the script to help them understand that you want to keep them as a client, you are high value and you are not desperate.\n5. How do you become so valuable that when they ask for work for free, they believe you are family and therefore every new contract will flow in your direction. In other words, you do this - and I will never leave.\n\nSo how do you answer these questions:\n\n1. Do they know you have very few clients? If so, why are you marketing this idea to them in the first place? You should always be marketing how scarce your time is. Therefore, your time is extremely valuable. I see so many business owners constantly fall into this trap when they are trying to please a client. It demonstrates weakness.\n2. How do you position yourself, do you drop price when they apply pressure? Or do you exchange a discount for other concessions from them?\n3. Ask the question as follows - \"Hey xyz - I realize that you all need these 'small tweaks' and we want you to be completely satisfied with the finished product. I do have some questions so we can improve our work product moving forward. The small tweaks you are asking for is a week of work on our side which is 20k/30k whatever it happens to be. The money is not an issue. You all are a fantastic client. However, when you require additional work pro bono (do not say free), it typically means we (you are taking responsibility) missed the mark. Where do you think we went wrong?\" This is an open ended question and allows the client to really think about what they are asking for. Maybe they even realize that they could have done things better.\"\n4. After question 3 is answered, and this is forward looking - \"I just took on a few new clients and we are hiring some additional folks. You are our top priority given our abc years together. So don't worry, we will make things happen. However, I am going to need some flexibility as we ramp.\" Yes this is bullshit. But guess what - a) you need to ramp and get some new clients so this never happens again. b) you create scarcity and he/she realizes you are the hot girl at the bar/club. It forces them to recalibrate. It also gives you time to work on getting new clients instead of putting all your time into free work. Which is a real problem in the consulting business. If you are fulfilling contracts, you are not selling. You need to either hire someone to do the work, or hire someone to sell if you never want to be here again.\n5. \"hey xyz - glad we are on the same page. What new initiatives are you planning?\" You just gave them 1 week of free work. He/she owes you. This is the time to ask for that work to be handed to you.\n\nHope this helps.",
