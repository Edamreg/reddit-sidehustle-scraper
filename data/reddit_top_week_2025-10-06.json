It honestly surprised me the first time I made a little money from one of them, since I never considered those skills worth much. Over time it added up, and that extra money plus a win on rollingriches even helped me buy my dream car something I never thought those small skills could lead to. Do any of you have side hustles where you‚Äôve managed to turn small or useless skills into actual income?",

      "selftext": "Those first couple of days on Etsy were rough. I had a shop set up, listings live, but the dashboard just sat there... no traffic, no favorites, no sales. I kept refreshing like a maniac, half-convinced nobody would ever find me.\n\nI didn‚Äôt bother wasting money on ads or trying to decode a bunch of SEO guides. Instead, I got curious and opened Twitter. Typed ‚ÄúEtsy‚Äù into search, switched to the Latest tab, and scrolled. Most of it was noise, but I started filtering for tweets that had 100+ reposts.\n\nThe thing that stood out? It wasn‚Äôt the big accounts going viral, they always do. It was the small ones. When someone with a couple thousand followers posted about a random Etsy product and it blew up, that meant the idea itself was hot.\n\nI caught one of those signals, pulled it up on HeyEtsy to see if people were actually buying, and sure enough the listings had fresh traffic. That was enough for me. I mocked up a quick version in Canva, listed it without overthinking, and walked away.\n\nTwo days later... cha-ching. My first sale. It didn‚Äôt make me rich, but it proved the shop wasn‚Äôt invisible. More than that, it showed me I didn‚Äôt have to sit around guessing products or wait forever for SEO to kick in.\n\nSince then, I‚Äôve kept the same little habit: spot what‚Äôs buzzing outside Etsy, double-check demand, and throw something up fast. Not perfect, but it works.\n\nAnyone else stumbled into their first sale in a weird way like this?",

Starting to think I need to explore other markets or go online.  \nSo here's what I'm trying to figure out. Do I take the clothing thing online to Poshmark or Ebay and try scaling that way? Part of me wants to stick with what's working but another part knows putting all my eggs in one basket is probably dumb. Just don't wanna overcomplicate things or spread myself too much either.

I'd waste hours scrolling listings while other resellers grabbed everything first. Ended up using this search software called ubuyfirst (or else can't remember exactly).

Just know you'll be up against resellers with actual systems, not casual sellers. That's really the difference between side money and scaling it properly. Hope that helps man.",

Food delivery apps (Uber Eats, DoorDash) you can start literally today if your car situation allows it. Taskrabbit for handyman stuff if you're even remotely handy. Facebook Marketplace flipping if you have any eye for underpriced items. Rover for dog walking if you're in a decent area for it. These aren't sexy but they pay within a week and require basically no ramp up time. If you've got any specific skills (design, writing, spreadsheets, whatever) Upwork and Fiverr are slow to start but can build up. I'd recommend stacking 2-3 of these so you're not dependent on one income stream.\n\nIf you're curious, I made this kinda fun tool called Cosmic Hustle (https://cosmic-hustle.vercel.app) that matches you to side hustle ideas based on your birth chart - it's just a fun way to brainstorm options you might vibe with and get some actual next steps. But honestly for immediate cash, the delivery/gig apps are your best bet while you're in application mode. They suck but they bridge the gap.",

So learn, and code an idea that solves a problem within an industry.  Sounds hard...it's not.  Also...aim low.  Meaning you're not looking to create the next Facebook...you're looking to solve one annoying problem at a time that a reasonable amount of people have.  You can find problems in ANY industry if you look for them.  The ceiling is through the roof, and you WILL have time.  I have a solid resume, 10+ years working with top Fortune 100 companies and I've been out of a job since December.  To be fair, I burnt out quick and said f\\*k it...allowed myself to think like a victim and took a few months off.  Now..I'm back on my grind and ai coding with no prior experience..it's fun and great upside.\n\nAlso..what I've learned to save you time.  \n\n1. Ghost posts: 40%+ of jobs are LIinkedIn are fake or you will never hear back.  I didn't believe this stat at first, now I'm convinced it's more like 65%.\n2. Fastest way to get a job = networking (no shocker, always has been..still is, now more than ever) Find someone you know at a company and check those opportunities first then ask if your poc can help you get your resume to recruiter. \n3. Second fastest way to get a job = be 1st apply.  Pay for job scrapers that feed you posted jobs within 30 minutes.  \"but hold up..that's excessive bro?  I'll just apply each day\".  Good luck!  Seriously, you'll need luck when your resume is submitted on top of 700 perfectly worded ai/chatgpt resumes hitting all buzzwords and perfectly ats formatted.  This ai era for job hunting is slicing both ways, equally bad for recruiters and candidates.  Recruiters can't respond to people now because they have to go through resumes that their software was supposed to filter, but now...they get hundreds every day, sometimes hour if it's good job.\n4. TAKE TIME FOR YOURSELF.  Remember, this is temporary, you'll figure it out...and then, you'll look back and say \"damn, I wish I enjoyed my free time a little more....why was I so stressed?\"  No income and steady bills is scary, I'm nervous as hell right now...but it's not lost on me I might never have my health (40 but fit and healthy) and this free time again.  So I wake up and do something fun each morning for 30 minutes.  You should too.  \n5. And lastly...everyone will have an opinion or judgement about why you haven't got a job in 17 business seconds.  they'll convince you \"companies aren't hiring\" or \"ai has taken everyone's job\" or you'll convince yourself \"maybe my resume isn't that good\".  Learn to block that out.  Your opinion is the only one that matters....sounds like a hallmark card..but I have had some tough calls from family..my father once telling me it's probable my inability to find a job is related to the layoff of my entire department including the president who was 2 levels above me.  It was purely financial, bc I knew the finances lol. I'd been there 14 years.  It's hard to shrug off everyone's worry, judgement, etc.  I hope none of this applies and you get a job in a few days.  But take from this what you need should it be longer.  You got this",

I feel like I‚Äôm someone who can comment on this as I‚Äôve been in a situation for the past 24 months of my life. \n\nI have had 2 jobs that I eneded up losing so in the past 2 years I‚Äôve been unemployed twice. \n\nFirst time was from January to October of 2024 and most recently May 2025 till now. \n\nThe good thing was I started building side hustles a long time ago and have always dabbled in them. \n\nSo what did I do? I started using AI to build anything possible in overdrive. \n\nI bought boilerplates to help with the code made products that people wanted and started working on them every second I had( I have 3 little kids 3 under 3. So my time was limited) \n\nIn those times I spent most of my time building ? When did I build? Between 9pm-2am or whenever I couldn‚Äôt keep my eyes open. \n\nEach day I built , marketed and kept going. I made decent money as well in total I made over 50k from my side hustles in the past year. \n\nMy problem wasn‚Äôt that I didn‚Äôt have ideas or built stuff people wanted it was I kept jumping ship. New product every few months people didn‚Äôt like that. \n\nThen this last month it all came to a halt. I was about to get kicked out of my house and I needed to sell it all. So I sold all of my things I built and everything I worked for for 13k to be able to live another 2 months of paying bills , health insurance etc. \n\nLooking back I wish I focused on one product and that‚Äôs it as my product would be better. \n\nIn terms of what works best that all depends. You can find freelancing work but nothing beats owning something yourself and with AI it has become easier. \n\nThe main thing and the easiest route is find a billion dollar company in a space you know or don‚Äôt know and pick 1 feature that they do. Build your own product around that one feature charge half the price and just focus on that. You‚Äôd be surprised how much you can make from it. \n\nYou can also start writing daily and publishing a daily newsletter etc as I think this will be great. I [write one myself](https://mattmerrick.com)\n\nYou can even make simple pdf or. A quick product on a topic you know and sell the pdf for $9 or whatever price you wish. \n\nCan do an Etsy shop etc really depends on you and your time. For me I‚Äôd just trying to build a micro SaaS that serves a market‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt have to be millions of people  even if it‚Äôs just 100 people you get at $9/month ads up. \n\nThe good thing is you are starting to think about this and just like me it can save you in the end.",

Then pay per click on google started. That was even easier. Keywords were cheap. You could link directly to sites. It was a good fun side hustle for 10 or 12 years. \n\nBut as things progressed and evolved it got costly. The rules changed. Competition was fierce. The money stopped. \n\nMy real job became more demanding and I had advanced to a nice pay level so was done with it. \n\nLooked into it recently since I retired. Even though I still see lots of people claiming they make money online I think it would require way more time and money to get going in affiliate marketing again than Im willing to commit and I don‚Äôt have the necessary skills anymore. \n\nSo now I just day trade and bet sports to pass the time.",

Small drops at first, then more stable, then it downpours. I explain it to people like you are a farmer and you grow or create stuff for people to consume, you have to keep growing bc people NEED to eat. \n\nMain issue w making money online is COMPETITION, you have to really stand out or be unique. \n\nMany people dont research the competition and learn the ins and outs of what they want to offer.  Is it a product, service, content? \n\nMost people will tell you they made some money but not enough to quit their job. Im not talking about programmers n web designers who will obviously make money, just your average Joe.\n\nI'll share with you some of my early ventures. \n\n-Modding for videogames I made a ton.  Especially after I setup patreon and people paid for early access to my mods.  Again, this was a hobby I invested in slowly, so I had a following.  \n\n-Selling crap from dollar tree on Amazon lol  not worth it since everything skyrocketed and they raised prices.  \n\n-During early days of Covid I asked myself what is something people will always buy.  Sex. So I ordered sex toys and gear in bulk from ali express, threw it on Amazon and made a killing once lock down hit and all that year. \n\n-This is kinda shady but its business lol.  Before I knew how to design graphics id pay Fivver artist. I was the one with clients and not them, id pay $25-50 for them to make a graphic or logo.  Id present it to my clients for $500-1k depending on how complex it was.  \n\n-Take some time to learn Ai, anyone making money in the future will be offering services they learned w Ai.  make yourself valuable in this space and youll never lack work.",

Also, getting money exclusively online is not consistent without knowing marketing and sales and refining a lot along the way. Initially, some work would be in person.\n\nThe first money I made purely online was from filling out surveys in between my part-time gigs in college.\n\nFor instance, getting tutoring clients from UniversityTutor and WyzAnt back in the early 2010's meant that I would get leads online, but most of my work meetings would be in-person. Now in  2025, it's similar to how I get work through apps for Uber/Lyft/Doordash but have to complete the work in person.\n\nI have gotten some purely online tutoring jobs since COViD and other online gigs, and I have create YouTube channels for guided meditations and associated profiles on Insight Timer and AuraHealth, but these last two are not enough to pay all of my bills.\n\nI know someone who completely built a SaaS business from scratch and became a millionaire before he turned 30, but he spent thousands of hours teaching himself how to code and working on freelance projects and learning how to outsource work to foreign developers as he secured more contracts. \n\nIn short, there's A LOT of trial and error, and most people online who gloss over that are telling you a story to sell you an idea or a course to serve themselves.",

Some side hustle money even at your age.  \n\nJust posted this on another thread, but add WeWard to one of the apps you run.  It‚Äôs in the background and very little effort.  Not tons of money but no effort really either, unless you want to put time into it and make more.  \n\nWeWard is a really easy low effort app.  Just download it in the App Store since I can‚Äôt post a link here.  Not gonna make you a millionaire, but I‚Äôve done several of these types of apps and this has required the least of my time and I‚Äôm averaging $50 a month from it. On track for $75 this month.\n\nIt‚Äôs a walking app and literally all I do is log onto the app at the end of the day and one click to ‚Äúcollect your steps‚Äù.  You don‚Äôt have to, but I do one survey for 5-10 minutes a night before bed too.  I know you‚Äôre not looking for surveys, but you really don‚Äôt need to do them on the app. There‚Äôs also games.\n\nMy referral code if anyone wants this ridiculously easy app to add to their side hustle library is:\n\nPeacefulRhinoceros9144\n\nFull disclosure: I get 100 points and you get 150 points, or ‚Äúwards‚Äù as they are called, once you reach 200 wards on your own.  You could do that the first day too if you did one or two surveys, or just collect your steps at the end of the day but it‚Äôll take a little bit longer.\n\nOne of many apps I run to get low to no effort gift cards or Venmo.",

      "selftext": "Look, when I say ‚Äúworst countries,‚Äù I don‚Äôt mean people are worse or better. Absolutely not. But let‚Äôs be real: our ‚Äúsick‚Äù planet today is divided into tiers. Some countries simply have far less resources, stability, and opportunities than others.\n\nThe idea is simple: even if you live in a country with tough conditions, you *can* still do something.\n\nBefore anyone says, ‚Äúeasy to talk!‚Äù ‚Üí I live in Lebanon. Bad electricity, bad internet, bad politicians, bad government, wars in the region, security issues ‚Äî all of it. I‚Äôm not here to talk politics, but to show what‚Äôs possible anyway.\n\nIf you have a laptop with even a *slow* internet connection, and almost zero money, you can still break through.\n\nI‚Äôm not bragging ‚Äî but here‚Äôs my story:\n\n* **2013**: Sitting in my CS master‚Äôs class, my professor mentioned Udemy. Me? Teach online? I was too shy to even speak in meetings. Still, the seed was planted.\n* I built my first ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù: a classifieds site for Udemy courses , launched it‚Ä¶ zero visitors. I had no clue about marketing.\n* **2015‚Äì2016**: Tried IT admin tools for my day job. They worked, but I didn‚Äôt know how to sell. Learned the hard way: marketing is 80% of any business.\n* **2016**: Quit my job with 1 year of savings. Risky move, but I was obsessed with financial freedom.\n* **2017**: Uploaded my first Udemy course ‚Äî a 30-min screencast about web hosting. Terrible quality, but since the niche had zero competition, I got my first sale: $12. That notification changed everything.\n* **2017‚Äì2018**: Started YouTube. One video tied to that course ranked, and I made my first $300/month online.\n* **2018‚Äì2019**: Launched My main website\n* **2019**: Built another Tools Website. It hit 1M visits in one year.\n* **2023+**: Scaled into multiple projects\n\nToday, I run 6+ projects with 6-figure annual revenue. I‚Äôm not a millionaire, and that‚Äôs not my goal. All I want is freedom: focus on research, education, and family without being chained to a 9‚Äì5.\n\nAnd before someone asks: *‚Äúwhy not just leave Lebanon?‚Äù* ‚Äî I tried. Lived in Qatar for months, Turkey for months, visited the UAE, and I‚Äôm now applying for a Golden Visa in UAE. Hopefully I get it, so I can have that option for my family. But in reality, we were born here, our friends and family are here. Leaving is not as simple as people think, especially with kids and bonds.\n\n**Most important lesson:** You don‚Äôt need to be special or have some dramatic ‚ÄúI was homeless‚Äù story. You just need to **start and keep going**.\n\nThe good news? You don‚Äôt need 10‚Äì11 years like me. With AI and today‚Äôs tools, you can achieve the same in a year or even months.\n\n**P.S.** If you‚Äôre wondering where to start with just a laptop + internet, here are some entry points:\n\n* Substack\n* YouTube\n* Medium\n* Micro-SaaS\n* Affiliate Marketing\n* Freelancing\n\nAll doable with zero investment except your time, effort, electricity, and some MBs of internet.",

Therefore, the children specifically do.\nThere is a term known as \"doom scrolling\" which children just scroll and scroll, vid after vid.\n\nEach view is. Important.\n\nThe vids u watch on media? You are paying people big bucks.\n\nFor some vids under certain categories they are getting paid $20/1000 views.\nImagine some dude whos a banker makes a vid of \"every day life of a banker\" and he gets 100k views.\n\n20x 100 = $2k. Funny thing is, vid probs took him 10 hrs to edit max, and maybe 2hrs of recording.\n\nSo u do the math there.\n\nIt compounds ontop of itself.\n\nThe only reason u don't see more of it is because its very tiring. Ppl get burnt out real fast. Finding clips is hard. As ppl nowadays are copyrighting your content.\n\nThen theyre watermarking it with fade away text that reappears every 5 seconds.\n\nOr they watermark it with diagonal text.\n\nEtc\n\nUnderstand that thjs isnt easy.\n\nGrowing a channel isnt hard.\n\nMAINTAINING IT is.",

      "selftext": "I have a day off, so I decided to do something hopefully useful and share my road on trying to earn income online in between these AI stories.\n\nMy ride is pretty much finished, not because I got financial independence till the rest of my life, but because I have a decent job which I don't hate, and some passive income. Pushing more seems like overkill at this point.\n\n\n\nHere‚Äôs my overview of what worked, and what didn‚Äôt:\n\n\n\nTotal flops:\n\nDropshipping/Shopify type of stuff ‚Äì personally worst imo. I don't know why I kept trying to push it for so long, maybe due to hype from every \"make 10k a month\" guru and course.\n\nPerhaps I haven't found the right niche. Not to say that I haven't made sales, occasionally some things were very close to being profitable, like portable blenders or fishing lures.\n\nBut for some reason it was never sustainable and maybe because I'm not very tech savvy ‚Äì time consuming. Ended up losing money overall.\n\n\n\nDigital products ‚Äì Every kid trying to sell their GPT prompts. Too easy to do. Pretty much lost money trying it.\n\n\n\nSemi-worked:\n\nAI girls ‚Äì Got in a bit too late, but still managed to make some money. Up to this day getting like $150, made like 100 posts and scheduled them every couple of days. If there are still some subs left in a year I will spend an extra half a day making another 100. At some point it was $3k‚Äôish a month, mainly coming from adult site ads. But once it got too popular it got shut down and they banned these type of ads. Some niche stuff might still work.\n\n\n\nPrint-on-demand ‚Äì Looks saturated, but worked alright-ish for me. Not online though, mainly contacting local businesses. So made a decent income.\n\nThe idea is that most businesses are okay with spending 500 on some custom printed t-shirts, but never proactively get in touch with someone. So if you show some samples, and make them an offer, they quite often said, ‚Äúalright, send them and give invoice.‚Äù Pretty straightforward.\n\n\n\nWhat worked best:\n\nAffiliate ‚Äì even though it seems very 2010, there are still products/niches that work well.\n\nFor B2B Semrush worked okay, because they are the leaders in the field. The idea was to approach new businesses that were trying to improve their reach and marketing and consult them about how they should move forward.\n\nHarder to get, but they pay out well and in time.\n\n\n\nFor B2C ‚Äì tried some pet stores, they have high margins usually so payout is good, but harder to push to market and you need to keep promoting the thing. Once you stop there is zero momentum.\n\n\n\nWhat worked for me is trying to find a niche that is not saturated, product works well and you can make recurring revenue. Like services that help find someone on Tinder ‚Äì I worked with DoTheySwipe which has a pretty accurate algorithm and people buy their monthly plans because they are insecure about their partners. So while Quora/adult ads are not crazy money and earn 15‚Äì20% more or less, the next month you can sit and do nothing and a bunch of subscription money will come in. Some people just never cancel.\n\n\n\nCrypto projects ‚Äì I think the hype train is going down, but that's where I made the most money. Not by buying their tokens, but by approaching them and outsourcing the services. Something like copywriting, social media posting, content creation etc.\n\nMost of them have a lot of money initially and would take your services. Then I'd go to Fiverr or Upwork and outsource decent freelancers from third world countries. Had like 3 projects I worked with and was charging them thousands, while paying pennies on the dollar.\n\n\n\nBeen a rough ride, but in a nutshell my conclusions are that while sometimes it's worth chasing the hype, it's usually not sustainable.\n\nAnd if you want to make FU money, at the end of the day you will have to do business and that's going to come with consequences, such as sleepless nights and constant stress.\n\nBut side gigs and income are for sure very reasonable and achievable. Cheers.",

      "selftext": "Every post I see here lately is some dumb get rich quick scheme or AI tool scheme making fake products or ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù it‚Äôs just dumb and it contributes to internet rot this immoral and it‚Äôs slop. \n\nTo make passive income It‚Äôs not hard. Basically what I did is take a hobby I love (I made modifications to video games) and try to do it to the best of my ability. Try to be as professional as possible, push myself to learn and grow. That‚Äôs it. Push your hobbies into a professional sphere. That‚Äôs how to do it. \n\nAgain this was a hobby I did for fun but it started with making video game modifications. Personally I started make a small amount of passive income (300$ a month) via hosting the modifications on a site that generates ad revenu from adds in the sides bars of the site, then made an official company out if it down the line for myself (just me as owner operator and hobby in free time). Started occasionally hiring one time payment contractors to do tasks for me- built a catalog of successes partnered with a game company and started creating content for them which if used I make money off the sales my work is used in. This turned it into about 900$+ a month some months over 1000$ a month passive income. \n\nNow I‚Äôm slowing that down and decided to write a sci-fi book. It‚Äôs in total about 350 pages, will be part of a series and I‚Äôm working to make it as professional as possible with the goal to publish. Again this is a hobby. It‚Äôs for fun. But if I get it published my fun could net me well who knows anywhere from 2,000 or 5,000 to 15,000 off the bat plus any extra the book makes. I‚Äôll assume lowest so let‚Äôs just say 2000 or something for a book that took me 9 months for fun in my free time. I learned how to write better, and I‚Äôm learning what publishing looks like and how to sell it to them. \n\nTo me that‚Äôs the legit way to make passive income. It takes more work. More time it‚Äôs not a get rich quick scheme it build skills and if you want to constantly push yourself in your hobbies and take it to a professional degree then it‚Äôll happen. ",

      "selftext": "Mystery box turned in sidehustle\n\nOkay so like the title says, I started selling small mystery boxes for like 10‚Ç¨. I'm telling in the description that you might find something valuable or nothing at all LOL, and I started doing this less than 2 weeks ago and I already have 62 sales üòÇ I have around 200 boxes that are pretty new( left from stuff that I ordered for my sister's wedding) and I'm just using this boxes. Sometimes I put inside a painting I made myself, sometimes I'm not putting anything, sometimes I put clothes that I don't use anymore, or books, or some snacks, and people really buy it lol \nIt's not really passive income as you still have to send them yourself, but it's something that still generates an income. I spend around 2h in the evening to prepare the boxes with the shipping address, and the next day I send them thru post. ",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nContinuing my hunt for niches that aren't completely saturated. My rule is simple: find a passionate group of people and solve a specific problem for them.\n\nHere are five product ideas I found that have proven demand but still have room for new, creative sellers. Hope this helps spark something for you.\n\n**1. Newspaper Canva Templates**\n\nThe Canva templates niche is really saturated, but there is still some room in the corners. Our goal here is not to make what everyone else is doing, but to find an opening to get started and then begin exploring other ideas.\n\nNewspaper templates are really popular right now, but a lot of people are making almost the exact same thing. So, if you just try to choose a more interesting topic, it can be really profitable.\n\nFor example, I‚Äôd start by creating a bundle or making anniversary newspapers. But this idea can absolutely be adapted for any holiday or celebration.\n\n**2. The Printable Mystery Game Kit**\n\nIf you love to write stories or have a great imagination, this is a fantastic niche for you. With the help of AI to brainstorm ideas, it can become a really profitable business.\n\nYou sell a single PDF file with everything needed to host a murder mystery dinner party: the script, the clues, and the character roles.\n\nThe key is, you are selling an experience, not just a file. This has a huge perceived value, and people will pay a premium for a unique activity for a party or a date night.\n\n**3. Notion Life and Business templates**\n\nThe Notion template niche is very popular, but I still think there is a lot of room for new sellers. While it's not easy to get to the top of the search, the huge demand can work in your favor.\n\nThe secret here is to stop trying to be a generalist. Don't just create a Life planner or a Business dashboard. The market is flooded with those. Instead, the key is to understand what you can do better than your competitors and implement that into a hyper-specific solution. For example, a Notion dashboard for freelance writers to manage clients, projects, and invoices.\n\n**4. Modern Cross Stitch Patterns (PDF)**\n\nThis is a great niche, but it does require some time upfront to understand how to create the right file formats. Once you figure that out, however, it will be much easier to create future products.\n\nJust search for it on Etsy and see for yourself how many bestsellers are in this niche.\n\nBut here's the key, don't just copy them and make something similar. The real opportunity is to create modern, funny, and even meme-based designs.\n\nYou're not just selling a pattern, you're bringing pop culture to a traditional craft.\n\n**5. AI Watercolor Cutouts**\n\nThis involves selling packs of beautiful AI-generated images (like flowers or animals) in a watercolor style, but with the background already removed (as transparent PNGs)\n\nYou are essentially doing 90% of the work for other creative people. Junk journalers and sticker makers get high-quality, raw materials for their own products.\n\nYou are selling them speed and convenience. Just choose a theme you love and start creating.\n\nThe main lesson is always the same: find a passionate community and solve a unique problem for them.\n\nHopefully, this gives you a good starting point for your own research!",

For example:\nAre digital/online hustles (like freelancing, AI tools, or content creation) outperforming physical gigs?\nIs e-commerce (Etsy, dropshipping, Amazon, print-on-demand) still worth starting now?\nAre newer opportunities with AI, automation, or even niche consulting turning into real income streams?\nAny hidden gems or underrated hustles that aren‚Äôt saturated yet?\nI‚Äôd love to hear from people who have tried something recently and can share how it‚Äôs going - whether it‚Äôs part-time freelancing, selling a product, leveraging skills on Upwork/Fiverr, tutoring, building digital products, or even something less mainstream.\nBasically: What side hustles are you seeing good money from right now, and what would you recommend (or warn against)?\nThanks in advance!",

          "body": "Selling digital products is still one of the most effective ways to build income with compounding potential. You can create planners, templates, mini courses, or niche resources using Canva or Notion and list them on platforms like Gumroad or Etsy. It takes some initial work, but once the products are live, they can sell passively for months.\n\nPrint-on-demand is still working, especially if you focus on underserved niches or trending themes. Platforms like Printful, Redbubble, and Etsy are still profitable if you know how to create clean, relevant designs. While it's more competitive, quality and niche targeting make a big difference.\n\nAffiliate marketing has been getting better for those who focus on creating persuasive content. You can recommend tools, courses, or physical products and earn when people buy through your link. It works especially well on TikTok, niche blogs, newsletters, or faceless YouTube channels, as long as your content is valuable and builds trust.\n\nDropshipping on eBay is underrated. Since eBay already has traffic, you don‚Äôt need to run ads like you would with Shopify. You list trending products and tools like AutoDS help automate product sourcing and order fulfillment. It‚Äôs still a legit option for beginners who want something low-risk.\n\nYouTube is continuing to perform, especially for niche or faceless content. If you can script well and focus on a specific audience, you can earn through ad revenue, affiliate links, and eventually sponsorships. Shorts and long-form are both working now, depending on your strategy.\n\nFreelancing is also strong, especially if you use AI tools to work faster. Writers, editors, designers, researchers, and marketers are combining ChatGPT with their skillset to deliver faster, higher-value results on Fiverr, Upwork, and Twitter.\n\nAnd yes, niche consulting and micro-agencies are growing. If you have specialized knowledge, like software, automation, or even social media strategy, offering a targeted service to solopreneurs or small businesses can pay well.\n\nOnce you're earning, investing part of that into index funds is a smart long-term play. It won‚Äôt make fast money, but it builds real passive income over time.\n\nI break down a lot of these side hustles step-by-step in my newsletter. Feel free to check it out, the link is in my bio.",

I have a lot of free time and tried everything I could online to turn minutes into dollars, this is the best thing I've found thats worth your time!\n\nWhen companies create / alter product lines.. they want to get a feel for how to general market will enjoy/dislike the product. Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often.

Reality check, it‚Äôs not that simple. The first versions looked uncanny, the captions were too generic and ChatGPT written, and engagement was dead. It took months of experimenting with tone, personality, and storytelling to make the AI feel ‚Äúhuman‚Äù enough to connect.\n\nOnce I got the system right with consistent aesthetic, defined persona, and smart posting plan, things started compounding fast. The crazy part? Once an AI Influencer gains traction, it scales way easier than a real person: still no one knows me, I can collab with anyone, no creative blocks. You can test 10 content styles a day, clone audiences across platforms...\n\nA few things I learned:\n\n* People don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs AI, they care if it's funny or provides some sort of value.\n* Personality &gt; Perfection. A bit of imperfection sells authenticity.\n* Treat your AI Influencer like a startup, not a side hustle.\n\nIt‚Äôs not passive at the start, but once you‚Äôve built a system, it‚Äôs one of the most automated income engines you can run. Set up AI agents that do the work for you. \n\nAnd now with SORA 2 it's just getting crazier. ",

But honestly, it wasn‚Äôt quick at all. The first few months were just me trial-and-erroring everything, picking a niche, testing video styles, learning how to script without sounding like a robot, and making thumbnails that didn‚Äôt look like they were made in Paint. Once I got a repeatable system down, that‚Äôs when it started to feel more ‚Äúhands off,‚Äù because I could outsource or automate chunks of it.\n\nA few things I learned the hard way: posting consistently beats overthinking every single upload, the first 10 seconds of your video basically decide its fate, and putting early earnings back into better editing/production makes a huge difference.\n\nIt‚Äôs definitely not a ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù type of deal, but if you enjoy tinkering with content and can be patient, it snowballs into something real over time.",

The growth is there, people love the content but the money side? Zero.

But right now, it feels impossible.\n\n\nMy question to the community:\nIf you were in my shoes... young with pages that are scaling like crazy but zero monetization options that work , how would you turn this into an actual business instead of wasted potential?\n\nAnd please don‚Äôt hit me with the generic ‚Äúbe patient, it takes time‚Äù advice.

It is positioning.\n\nHere is what I would do if I were you.\n\nFirst, stop trying to sell random things. Pick one clear lane that matches what your audience already comes to you for. If they follow for fashion, build something that helps them do fashion. Maybe style guides, digital lookbooks, or brand partnerships that fit your vibe.\n\nSecond, reach out to small clothing brands directly. Forget affiliate networks. DM ten a day. Offer to feature their products for a fixed rate or trade. Keep your prices low at first to build case studies. Once you have proof that your content drives traffic or sales, you can charge real money.\n\nThird, start collecting emails. Every post should lead somewhere you control. You cannot build a business on borrowed land. Use free tools like Notion or Gumroad to host guides or resources and grow a list.\n\nFourth, learn basic UGC strategy. Brands are paying creators thousands for short videos. You do not need an iPhone to start. Use what you have. Pitch your content style as portfolio work.\n\nAnd finally, stop thinking like a follower counter. Think like a media company. You have attention. Attention is currency. The minute you focus on solving a problem for your audience instead of chasing payouts, the money will show up.\n\nYou are not stuck. You are just one focused offer away from turning views into income.",

When the day came tho, nothing. I soon realized it was because I only had my Paypal linked, and at the time (not sure if this is still a thing) they had this asinine rule where you could only receive payments in Paypal up to 300 dollars a year. \n\nSo I begrudgingly made a Payoneer account and e-mailed them about the issue. Unfortunately, as anyone who has tried to email Oneforma has found out, they don't ever reply. I'm convinced there's not a single person checking that account. \n\nI emailed them 2 or 3 more times after, but nothing. I still had hope though; I could still see the invoices on the Oneforma page, showing up as \"ready to pay\". \n\nRecently though, I opened the website again, and to my surprise, I found they've redesigned it. And when checking the payments tab, all the old payments are gone. Both the ones that did get paid, and those that I never got. So now I don't really have any proof other than some PO IDs and screenshots of the project manager showing part of what I was supposed to be paid for the month of June. But then again, I don't think proof matters when they completely ignore your emails.\n\nSorry for the rant. Has anyone had an issue like this, and if so did you manage to solve it? I've honestly resigned myself to the fact I'm not ever seeing that money, but I'd like to know if there is a chance. Thank you.",

      "selftext": "So they're looking for remote AI Generalist - Freelance Opportunity Global job. Even though I have no experience, I definitely fit what they're looking for. I was happy as apple pie with ice cream on a hot day until I saw the pay. \n\n$6-$18 per hour, 40 hours a week, 10 hours a day based on experience. \n\nSIX DOLLARS AN HOUR? Last time I checked, it wasn't 1970. Federal minimum wage is $7.25/hour. So they're definitely acting illegally. Now I don't know if I should even trust this company at all! Six dollars an hour. Holy moses, that's a red flag and criminal. Also on the site I chose work from home. 700 jobs show up and most all are hybrid. That is NOT 'remote' in my opinion. Telus should put hybrid jobs under a hybrid tag and remote jobs (meaning 100% work from home) under a remote tag. This is disheartening. I was really thrilled I'd maybe finally have my first ever work from home job. I'll keep looking. But what do you all think? $6 an hour?!\n\nEdit: apologies.

      "selftext": "**I know it's a bit to read, but I'm really overwhelmed and appreciate any help.**  \n  \nApplied for 4 jobs in total, was called by a recruiter and asked for a an interview as soon as possible because \"they are in a hurry, it's about to start\", sat down for it the very next day, waited so long for someone to let me into the meeting that I thought I got the time wrong, refreshed the site, woman let's me in and says that the other person isn't showing up. Awkward smalltalk for a solid 10 minutes, then she says that her colleague had no idea that there's an interview, he came in, all unorganized and extremely unpleasant. When I told him that I come from an IT background, he told me that we \"have to see about that\" and proceeded to stutter his presentation that he didn't even finish before telling the other woman that he wants to be the one \"to test me\" (that was her part) - after declining to see my CV or any other information about me that she offered, because \"we're gonna do this differently\", then he had me in this roleplay where the other person (him) was basically barely smart enough to breath on their own, \"never used a phone in their life\" (but knows what they want to use and why) and then he made the whole thing very difficult, describing things to me in a manner that made it impossible for me to fully understand what he's talking about, still made it all the way through helping with this \"issue\", he of course found something to critique while the female co-worker was throwing positive remarks at me left and right. He then explained things to me like I was too dumb to breath on my own and said that he's gonna \"think about it and it'll probably take a couple of days\", but I was called 10 minutes later and they said I have the job.\n\nIt's call-center support, but I'm supposed to sell stuff while helping with issues, when I said that I know about selling stuff, that I have experience in it, he said that it's not like that. They're not selling things, it's just an offer. Before he said that they expect me to at least sell 2 things per month in the same breath. And how one in his team sold 30 plans this month and how much more money I can make, how I can get better positions with time, so many chances, bla bla, it was this weird mixture of talking like everyone is beneath him, how much everyone can gain from this and then being extremely pushy with the selling, to then say that this is not what the job is about. \"After the training the job starts, it's a real job after all, fun and games are over\" (??) and \"We're like McDonald's, offering mayo and ketchup with their meal\" and \"Are you able to help when someone is calling and their stuff isn't working but they didn't open the package yet?\", what a strange strange person.\n\nThey sent me the contract almost immediately, what they're paying is really bad, but \"the majority of your income will be from selling\" (which this isn't about, right?), the hours are insane, they expect you to do more hours which they don't pay for, the list goes on. I got the thing yesterday and they already called me and wrote emails and told me that I have to sign it before the link expires, I told them that I want to read and understand everything first. They are very pushy. I talked to 3 people and everyone gives different answers. I asked about my other applications, they told me that they're not looking at them anymore since we're in this process now, the next day I get an email about one of the other jobs, I asked if I still have a chance, they said yes, then she calls me today and says that the other jobs are full and \"I have this now, it's already starting\", even though I didn't sign anything.\n\nAnyway. I'm in a shitty position, I really need a job. But I also need my sanity.  \nAre there even chances to get more money? Are they as pushy as it seems?  \nCan anyone actually recommend Concentrix?\n\nThank you for your time.",

The smarter you are, the better you are at simulating risk (overthinking). You can see 274 ways a business will fail before you even start, and that ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù  becomes more powerful than just taking action and course correcting.\n\nI think that this raises a deeper point. Most entrepreneurs are not ‚Äúbraver‚Äù by nature. They were pushed (in some way shape or form), in childhood. The first business is often fueled by a pain like running away from rejection, insecurity, or anger. For me, it started when I got laughed at for telling my dad I would buy the dodge viper from the TV ad at 13. Later, I got fired unfairly from a hotel job. That humiliation became rocket fuel, which eventually made me start my real estate company  partly because I wanted to own that hotel one day and fire the manager myself.\n\nI guess some high IQ people avoid entrepreneurship not because they lack talent, but they lack the wound that forces them to bet on themselves. And in that case, comfort usually wins the mental battle. And whether that decision shows up as regret on a deathbed is hard to know..",

      "selftext": "So my mate opened what was supposed to be a bakery about 8 months ago. Decent pastries, cakes and stuff, nothing special and just about breaking even.\n\nThen she pivoted hard into the \"coffee shop\" vibe and renamed it something pretentious with \"&amp; Co.\" at the end. She's charging ¬£3.80 for a flat white and ¬£4.20 for a cappuccino. Premium prices for the area.\n\nThe coffee is made with a Nespresso Vertuo Pop she got for ¬£99 from Argos and pods that cost about 38p each when bought in bulk. No barista skills needed, just stick in a pod and press a button. She's making ¬£3+ profit per cup after the pod cost.\n\nThe irony is she first saw this machine when she came to my house. I've had this machine for yonks and I know that if you stick with the safe options like Costa Rica, El Salvador, Colombia, Mexico and those kind of pods, you just can't go wrong and nobody gonna have a clue.\n\nThere's a proper ¬£2k+ commercial espresso machine in the corner, the kind you'd expect in a specialty coffee shop. Customers can barely see it unless they're really looking or go out of their way to look behind the counter.\n\nShe bought it broken on purpose. Found it on Facebook Marketplace for dirt cheap and it's purely for aesthetics. It's never worked, it's literally just a prop.\n\nBehind that machine is the Nespresso machine doing all the actual work.\n\nFrom what she's told me she's selling 170+ cups a day on average. Rough maths says that's ¬£500+ in daily coffee revenue alone (not counting pastries) which is approx \\~¬£15k a month just from coffee.\n\nThe customers seem to be raving about it on Google reviews.\n\nPart of me thinks this is genius cos she's created an environment people want to be in and they're happy to pay premium prices. She laughs it off saying \"restaurants mark up wine 300%, nobody bats an eye\".\n\nIs this just smart business? She's asking me to join her and double down.",

On Windows there‚Äôs Wallpaper Engine, but on Mac everything I tried was slow, subscription-based, or had watermarks. So I just decided to build one myself.\n\nI didn‚Äôt expect much, honestly thought it would stay a small side project. But here‚Äôs where it ended up:  \n‚Äì $11,102 in revenue  \n‚Äì 1,380 paid licenses sold  \n‚Äì 55,000 website visitors  \n‚Äì 12,876 active users\n\nThe pricing is simple. Free version with 18 wallpapers, unlimited time, full quality, no watermarks. Pro unlock is a one-time lifetime license.¬†**No subscriptions.**¬†That decision turned out to be a key differentiator. People hate paying a monthly fee for something like wallpapers, and a lot of buyers even said they purchased just to support the project.\n\nAll growth came from organic channels. Reddit posts, word of mouth, and unexpectedly a few Telegram channels with over 2M subs that shared it. No ads. No influencer marketing. The¬†**app being open source**¬†gave a lot of trust too.\n\nChallenges:  \n‚Äì macOS updates constantly break things (lock screen wallpapers, menu bar glitches, etc.), so keeping up is tough  \n‚Äì App Store release is harder than expected and still not done  \n‚Äì Support requests scale fast once you pass a few thousand users\n\nBut overall, it‚Äôs been one of the most fun and surprising projects I‚Äôve worked on. Building something small but polished, launching it in the right places, and being transparent worked way better than I expected.\n\n(If anyone‚Äôs curious, app is called **Wallper)**",

A couple years ago I built a lead gen tool SocLeads for small businesses. I spent months focused on adding every feature people requested, thinking the more complete it was, the easier it would be to sell. The screw-up was not validating which pain points actually mattered, so I ended up with a bloated product no one was really excited to buy. Only after tons of wasted dev time did I realize I should have been laser-focused on solving just one painful, expensive problem for a clear niche.\n\nLesson learned: more features almost never fix your core value prop.\n\nI feel like sometimes those painful lessons stick the most.

A lot of really talented creators quit before they ever get traction, just because they‚Äôre stuck in that grind.\n\nWhat I‚Äôve learned: momentum matters more than perfect editing.

      "selftext": "Hey guys!  \n21M here ...recently graduated (CS). I‚Äôve already secured a 9to5 and am currently in a waiting period. I‚Äôm also preparing for a master‚Äôs degree, and in the meantime, I enjoy building cool projects. I built multiple projects: some are solo, good for my resume, and some have real business potential. Right now, I‚Äôm working on a project that‚Äôll be almost done within 1‚Äì2 days, but I‚Äôm confused and a little anxious. It‚Äôs not about the project or market potential. I‚Äôm worried about reaching a real audience.\n\nTo be honest, I‚Äôm an ambivert, an average guy with technical skills, so I don‚Äôt have social media followers. I have accounts on every social platform, and I use X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit daily. I have Instagram and Facebook accounts too, but my followers there aren‚Äôt the audience I need ...most are friends, relatives, or random people from my area. LinkedIn is totally a mess for me. On X I have only about 80 followers and maybe one or two likes per post. I have X Premium and I‚Äôm waiting for verification. Facebook and Instagram are almost dead accounts, and I won‚Äôt even talk about LinkedIn.\n\nBeyond that, the algorithms aren‚Äôt in my favour. I also have a YouTube channel where I used to post gameplay videos and random vlogs back in 10th standard. For some reason, I removed everything and started fresh ...now I have one video with 200 views and 70 subscribers.\n\nSo this is my current situation, and I‚Äôm worried about how I‚Äôll reach my audience when I launch. In college, I built multiple projects and animated the software in videos and posted across multiple social media handles, but I never got noticed because there was no crowd. Finally, I‚Äôm starting indie-hacking for side income, but I‚Äôm totally new to this field and I know indie hacking is not just development ..it‚Äôs marketing. I struggled a lot in college and still do; I‚Äôm not from a rich family, and I‚Äôm technically unemployed now, so I don‚Äôt have much money to invest in marketing.\n\nPlease, if anyone can help me with this, I‚Äôm open to advice and suggestions.  \nThank you.",

You mentioned having 80 followers on X but getting 1-2 likes per post... that's actually not terrible engagement ratewise, it just means you need to be more strategic about what you're posting. Instead of trying to build followers first, try finding where your potential users are already hanging out and complaining about problems your project solves.\n\nSince you're technical, start by being genuinely helpful in communities related to your project without pitching anything. Answer questions, share quick tips, solve peoples problems in comments. I used to waste hours crafting perfect posts that nobody saw, but then I switched to just dropping helpful content consistently using Pressmaster.ai to speed up the writing process.

They build followers after solving a real problem people care about.\n\nHere's your actual issue: you've built multiple projects that \"never got noticed\" which tells me you're probably building stuff nobody asked for. The market doesn't care about cool technical projects, it cares about whether you're solving a painful problem.\n\nBefore launching in 1-2 days, answer honestly: have you talked to 20-30 people who have the problem your project solves? Did they say they'd pay for it? If not, you're about to launch into the void just like your previous projects.\n\nFor reaching users with no budget:\n\nFind where your target users hang out. Specific subreddits, Discord servers, Facebook groups, wherever they discuss the problem you solve. Be genuinely helpful there for a week without mentioning your project. Build credibility, then launch. Those people will actually care because you've proven you understand their problems.\n\nPost on relevant subreddits but make it a story about the problem you're solving and why existing solutions suck, not a product ad. Our clients who do this well get way more traction.\n\nReach out directly to 10-20 people who'd benefit. Send personalized messages explaining why it'd help them specifically. Offer free access for honest feedback.\n\nCancel X Premium, it's a waste of money with no audience. Verification doesn't make your posts reach more people, good content does.\n\nThe biggest mistake is building first and thinking about audience later. Successful indie hackers build audience while building product. They talk about the problem, share their process, engage with users throughout. You can't show up on launch day with no presence and expect people to care.\n\nStop coding for the next 2 days and talk to potential users. Find 10 people with the problem and show them what you built. If they're not excited enough to use it immediately, you've got a product problem marketing can't fix.\n\nYour technical skills don't mean shit if you're building stuff nobody wants. Our customers who make money from side projects validated demand before writing code. You're doing it backwards.\n\nIndie hacking for income while unemployed and preparing for masters is honestly a lot. Most successful projects take 6-12 months to generate meaningful income. If you need money soon, get a part-time gig while you build.\n\nStop worrying about algorithms and followers. Focus on whether you're solving a real problem for real people.

It forces you to do things that scale badly but teach you everything about your users.\n\n**First 10 users (manual, this week):**\nGo where they already are. If your project solves a problem, there are forums, subreddits, Discord servers, or Facebook groups where people are complaining about that exact problem. Do not post your link. Answer their questions helpfully for 2-3 days first. Build some credibility. Then mention you built something that might help and ask for feedback. First 10 users are always hand-recruited.\n\n**Next 90 users (still manual, next 2 weeks):**\nYour first 10 users told you what they like and what is broken. Fix the broken parts. Then ask those 10 to introduce you to one friend each who has the same problem. Personal referral is the highest-converting channel that exists and it costs zero dollars. If they will not refer you, your product is not good enough yet.\n\n**After 100 users (systems kick in):**\nBy now you know which communities or channels sent you the best users. Double down there. Create content that helps people in that space (tutorials, case studies, before/after comparisons). The content brings people to you instead of you hunting them.\n\n**What will NOT work:**\n- Spamming your link everywhere (banned instantly, zero trust)\n- Waiting for organic discovery (nobody finds you by accident)\n- Building in private and launching with a big reveal (momentum dies in 48 hours)\n\n**The real secret:**\nLaunch to 10 people, get feedback, improve, launch to 10 more. Repeat weekly. Small continuous launches beat one big launch every time. Your 9-to-5 gives you runway. Use that advantage. Most founders have to go big immediately because they are burning savings. You can test slowly and learn deeply.\n\nBeing an ambivert is fine. You do not need to be loud. You need to be helpful in the right places.

Most are either dead or irrelevant now because they couldn't crack the fundamental network effects problem.\n\nPeople use Instagram and TikTok because that's where everyone already is. Your app being better or healthier doesn't matter if none of their friends are on it. Our clients who've tried launching social networks learned this the hard way, you need massive viral growth from day one or you're just another empty platform where people sign up, see nobody they know, and delete it.\n\nThe features you're describing sound more like a wellness or productivity app than a social network honestly. Mood prompts, shared journals, and productivity tools are fine, but they're not really social features. They're personal development tools with some sharing capabilities. That's not necessarily bad, but you gotta figure out what you actually are because the positioning is confusing.\n\nThe people who complain most about social media being toxic often don't actually switch platforms. They keep using Instagram while saying they hate it. The 30 minute doom scroll problem isn't solved by a different app, it's a behavior issue. Our customers in the mental health space see this constantly, people know what's bad for them but changing behavior is really damn hard.\n\nFriend and family feedback is worthless for validation. They're telling you what you wanna hear. Real validation is getting 100 strangers to pay for your app or use it daily for a month without you reminding them. Until you've got that, you don't actually know if there's market demand.\n\nIf you really wanna pursue this, pick one specific niche community and build for them exclusively. Don't try to replace all of social media, that's impossible. Maybe it's for parents trying to stay connected without the comparison trap, or remote teams wanting better communication, or accountability partners for specific goals. Narrow focus gives you a shot at critical mass within one group.\n\nStop asking if the world needs this and start proving specific people will actually use it consistently. That's the only validation that matters.",

      "selftext": "I've done marketing for e-commerce brands for about a decade. Just about everyone I know who started an agency around the same time as me has either switched industries or is going all in on \"AI business solutions.\"\n\n*Call me crazy*, but I looked into a vast amount of \"revolutionary\" AI tools for e-commerce brands, and I found them all underwhelming. There are some good tools to manage analytics, help with copywriting, and automate simple tasks, but nothing that does anything the average business owner can't do on their own.\n\nThe big issue I found with businesses chasing AI to become more \"efficient\" is that it makes the brand less personal. I've specialized in email marketing for the past 5 years, and making things less personal is the exact opposite of the goal I've been trying to achieve. I think the disconnect here for me is my intentions with ai. I want to use it to enhance the customer experience, but a lot of people just want to use it to save time and money.\n\nThis post is going to break down how I've done the opposite of where the market seems to be trending over the past few years and how it worked.\n\n**Customer Service**\n\nHave you ever had a serious issue with a company and had trouble reaching a real person?\n\nIt sucks. I remember yelling into my phone, saying \"CUSTOMER SERVICE\" months ago, when all I could get access to was an AI voice handling PayPal support on the phone.\n\nI've always looked at AI as a way to make things better, but sometimes you just need to talk to a real person. Making that more difficult only ruins the buying experience.\n\nEveryone I know is making a hard push for AI receptionists, chatbots, and automated messages. I've been hiring laid-off customer service agents who speak English as their first language and deploying them on social media, private groups, and email for the brands I work with.\n\nBeing able to DM a brand with your order number and solve a complex issue within 5 minutes is almost unheard of. But it's relatively easy to pull off. Simple things like this put your brand on another level.\n\nYou would not believe the number of customers who thank the brands we work with for being easy to reach, transparent, and human.\n\n**Groups**\n\nAI can replace your graphic designer, your email copywriter, and eventually your media buyer. There are probably already AI softwares that can duplicate your website, your ads, and your email sequences in minutes.\n\nBut it will never be able to replicate a group of people who are genuinely interested in what you're selling.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I made a post called \"Reddit Marketing is Underrated.\" I talked about how I build subreddits for brands. It's a goldmine for interacting with customers, doing market research, and boosting organic sales.\n\nI never realized how powerful a group of 20k engaged users in your sub or group could be. The possibilities are endless. You can collect emails, build funnels, and use data for retargeting.\n\nWhether it's Reddit, Facebook, or Discord, the group-building works. It's endless free UGC. It grows organically once you get momentum. It builds trust. And if you stick to it, it becomes your cheapest client acquisition channel.\n\nIf you treat people well in your group, they will take it upon themselves to shill your brand and want nothing in return.\n\nI made an entire post about how I pushed 2.5 million for a brand that stopped running ads in less than a year. The money was made because we made people enthusiastic about supporting the brand.\n\n**Personalized Emails and SMS**\n\nEveryone does some version of email marketing (I'd hope so), but few take it seriously. There's a lot more to list segmentation than just sending emails to your 90-day engaged list. There's a lot more to merge tag personalization than just using it for first names.\n\nI'll give you an example here. Ask yourself: \"How would I send out a free shipping campaign?\"\n\nYou'd probably just create one version of a free shipping email and send it to your engaged list. It would work. You'd get some sales. But it could have done twice as well.\n\nHere's what I'd do (for a brand that has at least 20k emails): I'd make 3 versions of this email. They will all be basically the same, but the copywriting will be slightly different.\n\nThe 3 segments I'd send to are:  \n1x Buyers  \n2x+ Buyers (VIPs)  \nNon-buyers\n\nWe tell the 1x buyers that this is our way of saying thanks for their last order.  \nWe tell the VIPs that this is an exclusive sale just for them (and maybe even sweeten the deal).  \nWe tell non-buyers that now is the best time to try our products and avoid shipping fees.\n\nNow for subject lines. Most will say something like:\n\n**Subject line:** Free Shipping for a Limited Time ‚úàÔ∏è\n\nNext time, try something like this for nearly double the open rate:\n\n**Subject line:** We're doing free shipping for customers in {Users\\_City}\n\nThis is just one example of how you can go the extra mile with email marketing, add personalization, and make people feel special.\n\n**Flipping the Script**\n\nYou'd be surprised how many stores rely on ads to keep the brand alive. Some brands we see have 80%+ of their sales coming from ads and only 20% from email and organic.  It's not uncommon for me to see 60%+ of the sales coming from a Klaviyo account because of what I build on the backend.\n\nWe flipped the script. We focused on the customer experience and organic growth.\n\nThe goal is to get to a point where 80% of the sales come from sales channels that the brand owns, like social media, email, and groups.\n\nThen we put a massive focus on building the things money can't buy. You can't buy organic sales. You can't use AI to generate an engaged email list or an active group with potential customers in your niche.\n\nI truly believe that focusing on the customer experience and owning your organic sales channels is going to be the only thing store owners can do to stand out in the coming years.\n\nEverything else is just too easy to duplicate or could be taken away with an account ban.",

The people who gave feedback on the idea earlier seemed excited, but that hasn‚Äôt translated into paying customers.\n\nFor those of you further along, how did you know whether to pivot vs. keep pushing?

          "body": "Zero signups means either nobody saw it or your messaging is unclear. Traffic without signups is a positioning problem, not a validation issue.\n\nStop guessing and ask the 10-20 people who gave positive feedback why they haven't signed up yet. Not \"would you use this\" but \"what's stopping you right now?\" Their answers tell you if it's pricing, trust, unclear value, or they were just being polite.\n\nExcited feedback that doesn't convert means people liked the idea in theory but don't see how it solves their actual problem. Our clients who launch successfully spend more time on landing page copy than features because you have 5 seconds to make someone understand what you do and why they care.\n\nCheck your landing page honestly. Does it lead with the problem you solve or features? Can someone understand what you do in one sentence? Is there a clear CTA above the fold? Most failed launches have pages that are too vague or focus on what the product is instead of what problem it fixes.\n\n\"Couple communities\" isn't enough distribution. If you got 50 visitors total, that's not a real test. You need hundreds of targeted visitors to know if conversion or reach is the problem.\n\nBefore pivoting, test this: rewrite your landing page to lead with the biggest pain point you solve. Add testimonials from beta testers. Create a demo video. Offer easy free trial with no credit card. Drive a few hundred targeted visitors and see if conversion changes.\n\nTrack where dropoff happens. Use Hotjar to see what people actually do. That tells you if it's clarity or trust.\n\nDon't quit after one month and one attempt. But don't keep pushing the same broken approach either. Change messaging, test different channels, talk to people who didn't sign up. Give yourself 90 days of real iteration before deciding the product itself is wrong.\n\nThe gut punch is normal but don't let it make you quit too early. Most successful products didn't work on first launch, they worked after founders figured out how to communicate value clearly.",

          "body": "Fart humor is a legitimate niche honestly. There's a whole market for novelty products, gag gifts, and crude humor merchandise. Cards Against Humanity built a massive business on offensive humor, so there's definitely money in this space if you do it right.\n\nThe problem is you're starting with a blank website and no clear product or content strategy. Having a domain and an empty site means you've done basically nothing yet. You need to figure out what you're actually selling before worrying about brand building.\n\nAre you selling physical products like t-shirts and mugs with fart jokes? Digital content like funny videos or memes? A subscription service? Party games? The format matters because it determines your entire marketing approach. Our clients in novelty products learned this early, you can't build a brand around a vague concept, you need specific products people can buy.\n\nIf you're going the merchandise route, start with print on demand through Printful or similar so you don't have to hold inventory. Design 5 to 10 really funny fart related graphics or slogans. Test them on Reddit in communities like r/funny or niche subreddits where crude humor flies. See which designs actually get laughs and engagement before putting them on your site.\n\nFor content marketing, start a TikTok or Instagram account posting fart related humor. Skits, sound effects, relatable jokes about farting in public, whatever. Build an audience first, then funnel them to your products. Our customers in novelty spaces get way better conversion when they've built an audience through free content versus just launching a store with no traffic.\n\nThe brand name and website design should lean into the crude humor fully. Don't try to make it classy or subtle, that's not your market. People buying fart stuff want it to be juvenile and over the top. Look at brands like Liquid Ass or Fart Spray for inspiration on how to own the crudeness without being apologetic about it.\n\nYour biggest challenge is standing out in a space where tons of people have tried fart humor brands before. You need a specific angle that makes yours different. Maybe it's targeting a specific audience like office workers, maybe it's combining farts with another interest like gaming or sports, whatever. Generic fart jokes have been done to death.\n\nStop sitting on an empty website and start creating actual content or products this week. Test what gets reactions, double down on what works, and build from there.",

That's an odd (if not unprofessional) request, since you're the one getting paid, not the other way around, where this can be an issue (financial liability).\n\nTo found a GmbH you need to go to a notary. That'll cost around 700-ish ‚Ç¨ and you need to put in a capital contribution to the company which is 25,000‚Ç¨ - half of which have to be paid into immediately.\n\nThe cheaper variant would be going with a UG (Unternehmergesellschaft) first - which is a pre-step to a GmbH but you only need 1‚Ç¨ capital contribution (You still have to pay the notary). A UG is required to \"save up\" to a GmbH level capital contribution and once that is achieved it will transform into a GmbH.\n\nThere's a lot of paperwork, expect the whole process to take 3 months.\n\nAre you sure they asked to work with a GmbH?

      "selftext": "We [managed to cross $1k MRR](https://x.com/onlinedopamine/status/1958544915966861629) with our startup 4.5 months into launching the product, so I wanted to use this post as a way to reflect on what has been working and what hasn't. \n\nQuick aside: this is the first time I ever had a SaaS that makes four digits. Launched 4 before (2 still active). Did all of this while working a regular full-time job. \n\nHere are all the marketing hacks that moved the needle:\n\n1. Build in public. \n\nYes, nothing revolutionary here. We're in the B2B space (or prosumer at the very least) and I do believe it helps if people know you. \n\nPersonally, I don't even publish that much about our startup (since there isn't something super exciting happening all the time) to not come off as salesy. Instead, just sharing tidbits about my life, things I find interesting, opinions I have, places I travel to, and so forth. \n\nJust be a normal human being and realize that post people, especially on social media, don't actually care much about your business (at least not to the extent they care about you as a person). \n\nPieter (Levels), I find, does this exceptionally well. Maybe every 5-6th of his posts is about a product of his and he mostly just talks about things he finds interesting. \n\n2. Case studies\n\nI wanted to mention this as a separate point, even though it's utilizing the same platforms (X and Threads). \n\nIn our case, I share successful slideshows other accounts publish on TikTok, detailing the copy they use, the products they promote, influencers they work with, and such. \n\nThis is the part where we deliberately target our ICP - and where we see the highest ROI in terms of conversions. \n\nIntuitively, that somewhat makes sense. Many in the app space, for example, are still somewhat unaware of the benefits of slideshows, so seeing successful examples (and how you can replicate them) is oftentimes all the inspiration you need to get started. \n\n3. Building what our competitors are missing\n\nThere's one competitor in our product category who sucks up most of the oxygen (since he was the first to launch a product in the category). \n\nHowever, his product is still missing tons of essential features. So, we simply built those (e.g., workspace &amp; team features) based on customer queries. \n\nAgain, this also ties back into point 1. Those prospective customers wouldn't have found us if it wasn't for building in public. And then we executed quickly once they did. \n\n4. Experiment with pricing\n\nWe initially started with a simple subscription like anyone does. However, what we soon realized talking to our users is that many don't want to pay for and use all of the features our product offers. \n\nAs a result, we introduced a credit-based system and split up our plans into four distinct tiers, with one plan only offering the most basic of features (so that customers can then top up with credits if they need access to any of the other features). \n\nAnd now some of our customers actually spend hundreds of $$$ just on credits while still being on the cheapest tier. \n\n5. Message your competitor's customers\n\nOur main competitor is pretty active on socials, so every time he'd post, we simply would send a message to all the people who replied. \n\nIt works really well if you take point 3 serious and can use those differentiating features as the baseline for your message (e.g., \"Hey, I saw that you use x, I work on y and we have the following features abc that you may find interesting). \n\nI feel like way too many indie hackers want to play nice, be liked, and don't step on anyone's toes. \n\nThis is a business you're trying to run after all, so be as brazen as you humanly can. \n\n6. YouTube\n\nIronically, as I am typing this, our YouTube channel just got banned lol. This one hurts because it had been converting super well, especially considering the still fairly low amount of views. \n\nThe simple reason is intent. We mostly did search-based videos (e.g., people looking for how to do xyz), which meant that intent is super high.\n\nThe great thing about search-based YouTube is that those videos also tend to rank for a long time (as people keep searching for that keyword). \n\nHopefully we can get our channel back because it was actually the acquisition channel I was excited the most for and spending a substantial amount of time on. \n\n  \n\\--- \n\nIf you guys have any questions, feel free to ask away :)  \n",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone. For context, we‚Äôve been running internal benchmark research to see how different promotions affect sales and engagement. One trap that keeps popping up is that vendors have trained customers to a certain behavior. And it backfires. What I mean is that when people want something in a $$$-$$$$$ range, they just wait for the next big sale. Black Friday, mid-season, clearance, whatever ‚Äî they know patience pays.\n\nSo the obvious question: what‚Äôs the alternative? We‚Äôve seen brands testing widgets with bundles, gifts for purchase, free shipping, loyalty rewards, etc. Some of these help margins and engagement, but the numbers are mixed.\n\nBundles work for AOV, but feel forced, especially if a customer doesn't really need the second item. Gifts are great, but you attract freebie hunters who buy just for the bonus. Loyalty programs are just too slow to show results, and people want quick wins.\n\nWhatever you choose, it‚Äôs like trying to outrun Beyonc√© at the Grammys. However, one lever we‚Äôve seen working better than others is free shipping thresholds. Shoppers hate paying for delivery, so they‚Äôre more likely to add extra items to the cart just to cross the line. Psychologically, it trains shoppers‚Äô behavior in a way that actually encourages paying, rather than waiting for discounts.\n\nFor the sake of research (and curiosity), have you guys found anything that can compete with -50% off in terms of conversion and profitability?\n\n",

          "body": "You‚Äôre right about discount conditioning. What‚Äôs worked best for me when we wanted Black-Friday-level conversion without torching margin:\n\n1. Shipping threshold tuned to the 70th‚Äì80th percentile cart. If your median cart is 42 and p80 is 58, set free shipping at 55‚Äì60. This reliably bumps AOV without training people to wait.\n2. Choice bundles, not forced kits. Let buyers pick any 2 or 3 from a curated set and auto-apply a small step discount. Perceived control beats bigger blanket cuts and returns stay lower.\n3. Store credit instead of percent off. Example: spend 60, get 10 store credit that activates in 14 days. You protect margin now and pull a second purchase later.\n4. Limited value adds that cost you pennies but feel premium. Examples: extended warranty, priority handling, sample sizes, engraving, install help. These attract fewer freebie hunters than high-value gifts.\n5. Private promos to warm audiences only. Email, SMS, loyalty tiers. Public site stays full price so you don‚Äôt anchor future traffic to sales.\n6. Creator or affiliate bonuses that stack as a value add, not a price cut. Let partners include their mini course, template, or preset pack with your product via unique codes. Conversion pop without training for minus fifty.\n7. Price integrity play. Keep list price stable, run fast 48-hour campaigns on specific outcomes instead of storewide sales. Example: ‚ÄúWorkspace refresh event‚Äù with free desk mat plus credit on organizers. Clear theme beats generic discounts.\n\nMeasure with holdouts. Optimize thresholds quarterly, not weekly. The only things I‚Äôve seen truly compete with 50 percent off are shipping thresholds plus credit-back mechanics, because they increase willingness to pay today and bring people back later.",

      "selftext": "Hey my online brothers and sisters,\n\nSome of you might remember me from last spring when I started the whole ‚Äúdropshipping has 9 lives‚Äù experiment. The idea was simple. Could I, relying only on my past experience, once again take a store from 0 to 100K profitably and without overcomplicating it. I wanted to motivate beginners, prove the ‚Äúdropshipping is dead‚Äù crowd wrong, and take a jab at the wannabe gurus who promise flying Lambos, threesomes with Sydney Sweeney and Emily Ratajkowski, and instant success just by manifesting it.\n\nBack then I even promised that once the store hit 100K I would give it away to someone here. Shame on me, that never happened. And there are reasons. First, I was honestly shocked by how many store flippers are lurking here, ready to acquire and resell sites to who knows who and at what price.\n\nSecond, the ‚Äúhey bro just give me the store‚Äù messages kept coming for weeks and months, often from people who clearly had no clue about even the basic foundations of dropshipping, and that was a huge turn off for me.\n\nSo instead of giving the store away and shutting it down, I just kept growing it. Now after $1M in sales I decided, with the help of my former mentor, to use it as an open free case study.\n\nSo, here is what we covered so far:  \n‚Ä¢ How to build a professional looking store with free themes, free graphic resources and free apps  \n‚Ä¢ How to connect it properly with payment methods and social accounts  \n‚Ä¢ How to acquire payment processors and keep them \"alive\"  \n‚Ä¢ Learning about niches, which ones are the most lucrative and why  \n‚Ä¢ How to properly do product research and quickly find completely untapped products, showing our own unique methods  \n‚Ä¢ How to run Meta Ads and stay profitable in today‚Äôs Andromeda chaos, covering everything from ad copy, creatives, campaign setup, metrics, product testing, scaling, and making a bulletproof system in case of ad account shutdowns  \n‚Ä¢ How to run Google Ads, covering basically the same topics as on Meta  \n‚Ä¢ How to run a Shopify store, focusing on the technical side of it, covering everything from fulfilment of orders to store redesigns for events like Black Friday and more  \n‚Ä¢ How to do customer support, which no one likes to talk about but is just as important as product research and marketing\n\nWhat is still in the works:  \n‚Ä¢ Fighting and winning chargebacks  \n‚Ä¢ TikTok marketing\n\nAll of you are invited to participate so we can finally create something valuable and free, something that we can all learn from. I truly believe this industry, with the flood of AI tools and everything moving online, will only become easier to manage and more lucrative in the future.\n\nAnd yes, happy beginning of Q4. That‚Äôs all from me for now brothers and sisters, talk to you soon.",

Social proof isn't a vanity metric; it's a credibility signal for both users and algorithms. A page that looks active and discussed simply performs better.\n\nMy own sites didn't gain traction until I started treating social validation as a core part of my launch strategy for key articles. Using a service like Viral Rabbi to seed that initial, foundational layer of engagement was the catalyst. It made my content look established and trustworthy, which kept real users on the page longer. Google noticed the improved metrics, and the organic growth finally followed.

Another negative is word gets around, \"you gave john this price, I need the same but you're 20% higher?\" You don't want the reputation that you price according to the person. You want them to think they get the same price as everyone. I'm in the automatic transmission business and sell anywhere from 5 to 12 jobs a week, the cheapest vehicle being a total cost around $3300, the highest around $9,000. If they say \" well you're 1000 higher than the guy up the street\" I say well that guy doesn't have a $15k flush machine and doesn't do in-house programming and doesn't do the things I do DURING the job like rear main engine seals and transfer case seals and gaskets. Once they hear that they're sold. All they need is assurance.",

Costs me very little, buys me goodwill and on second order and third and fourth and...I get my price.\n\nIm dealing with repeat business so its all lifetime value. I might also tell them I can give them 30 days EOM terms vs 30 days net which is our standard. Albeit they dont know 30 days EOM is in effect our standard as I played the same trick on most! \n\nSo selling to them what they'd have got anyway is my tactic. And its surprisingly effective. \n\nDiscounting from the off basically is an invitation to have a real struggle managing price up from thereon. \n\nSometimes I may take a customer on at a lower price than Id like to win and then work to tie them in so heavily to us that over a period of time we can get the margins up, the long game.

From a purely financial view, if she was not your wife it would not make sense to invest in an entrepreneur who cannot stick to things and cannot setup a website.\n\n\nSo that brings us to the marriage side of things. You should expect that any time or money you spend on this business is going to be a net loss. So this is a gift to your wife to try and make her happy. From that viewpoint I recommend only helping her when she asks and making sure that you do not mess up your main business for this new business that will likely fail. Do not jump in and try to make her business succeed. Just expect failure, do just enough to make her a bit happier, and make sure your main business keeps working",

      "selftext": "A few months ago, I had an idea I couldn‚Äôt shake. The problem was familiar: every time I‚Äôve had an idea in the past, I either got stuck in analysis paralysis or went down the rabbit hole of coding, logos, product names, and all the ‚Äúfun‚Äù distractions. Weeks or months would pass before I showed it to anyone, and by then I usually lost steam or realised nobody wanted it.\n\nThis time, I forced myself to do the opposite. My goal was simple: could I get strangers to care about my idea in less than a weekend? No product, no backend, no fancy branding. Just the bare minimum to test the interest.\n\nSo I worked on creating a landing page. To get people onto the page, I did two things. First, I shared it in a couple of communities where I knew the target audience hang out. Second, I put about $250 into very small ads just to see if anyone outside my personal network would click through. Nothing fancy.\n\nThe results surprised me. In 4 days, about 220 people visited the page. 63 of them actually signed up. That‚Äôs almost 30%. And a few of those people even replied to the confirmation email I sent, asking me questions about the idea and saying they‚Äôd pay for something like this if it existed. That was the kind of signal I never got from building in a vacuum.\n\nWas it perfect? No. But it gave me more validation in two days than months of building ever had. And honestly, it took the pressure off. Instead of wondering ‚Äúdoes anyone want this?‚Äù I could move forward knowing at least a small group of people had raised their hands.\n\nSo if you‚Äôre sitting on an idea and spinning your wheels, don‚Äôt overthink it. Write down the problem clearly, describe how you‚Äôd solve it, and put up a simple landing page with a signup form. Drive a little traffic and watch what happens. Even if you only get a handful of signups, that‚Äôs still real feedback from real people.",

Just me figuring it out, messing it up, and trying again.\n\nThis week my dashboard rolled over the $480,000 mark in total revenue (I know it's a pretty specific milestone number but [4 &amp; 8] are my favorite numbers, haha). It didn‚Äôt come fast. The first year I made $0-$500 for 9 months. I was SO CLOSE to quitting after a string of chargebacks. A contractor ghosted me LITERALLY mid project and I had to refund work I couldn‚Äôt afford to refund. I still take calls from a cheap desk in my second bathroom (that I never used and converted over into an office)...\n\nI know this isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmade it‚Äù / retirement money and I‚Äôm not trying to sell anything. I just needed to say it somewhere so people understand what it costs to get even this far. The late nights. The ‚Äúis this stupid?‚Äù loop. The quiet wins nobody sees. I promise you it pays off no matter how much you don't get it\n\nIf you‚Äôre early: keep building those fundamental structure points.. If you‚Äôre further along: RESPECT!\n\n Today I‚Äôm just letting myself feel proud for a second, then it‚Äôs back to grind.\n\nNo links, no pitch, no \"click on my profile\" hidden motive BS.. \n\njust sharing a moment with folks who get it...\n\nEdit: Wow, I wasn‚Äôt expecting this much feedback haha. Appreciate everyone who took the time to comment. For anyone wondering how it started, my first few clients came from straight cold outreach emails and calls (my gf handled the emails while I handled the calls) until someone finally said yes. Nothing fancy, just persistence. And if your quality matches that persistence then most the time you can count word of mouth as a big source of your business. \n\nSIDENOTE: IF YOU'RE ABLE TO FIND DECENT QUALITY SALES REPRESENTATIVES WILLING TO WORK FOR COMMISSION.. it really paid off for me and can really help speed along that process. My mother always told me that one head is good but two heads is better, but I think ten heads is even better than that and so on and so forth ... Obviously it's not mandatory but in my case it really helped me cover more ground than I would have been able to, alone.",

          "body": "Reading your story really hits home because I‚Äôve faced similar long, uphill climbs where progress felt slow and full of setbacks like chargebacks and unreliable contractors. There‚Äôs so much unseen grinding behind every milestone like yours, the endless late nights and moments of doubt I can relate to deeply. I remember turning my own spare corner of a home into an office, hustling with cold outreach and second-guessing decisions, yet inching forward with persistence and learning. The way you kept the faith, stuck to fundamentals, and eventually built a system that brought consistent revenue is exactly what many entrepreneurs aspire to but few capture in words so honestly.\n\nOne practical thought is your insight about commission-based sales reps, which can exponentially expand reach and lighten your load when you‚Äôre ready to scale beyond solo efforts. Persistence coupled with quality work becomes magnetic, you build momentum that sustains the grind. Celebrate this $480K with pride, it‚Äôs a testament to your resilience and smart hustle, and let it fuel the next phase of growth. I coach entrepreneurs through these stages of hard-won success and scaling, helping them build teams and systems to multiply impact while maintaining what they‚Äôve crafted. Your story encourages anyone stuck in the grind to keep putting one step forward, because those quiet wins truly do pay off.\n\nAustin Erkl - Entrepreneur Coach",

      "selftext": "If youve been running ads for eCommerce, SaaS, or mobile apps you probably realized Meta ad performance has been abysmal the past year.\n\nWe used to grow eCommerce brands primarily with meta ads but CPMs just kept rising and conversions kept decreasing. And this was BEFORE the latest andromeda update.\n\nAnyways here‚Äôs how we took a Canadian eCommerce brand from $80k in April to over $300k (CAD) in June. They sell sleepwear but this approach also works for B2C SaaS, record labels &amp; mobile apps.\n\nHope this helps even one person ahead of Q4.\n\nHere are the exact steps:\n\n1. Get a bunch of US phones with TikTok then scroll the explore page and like things in your niche. Search for related hashtags, then engage with the videos so your feed is personalized.\n\n2. Prepare a TON of videos by replicating what you see on your #foryou page. Literally copy and redo the videos and follow formats that are already proven to work. This can be as simple as a 20 second video with a caption over it and a viral song. Don‚Äôt overthink it! For eCommerce also carousels work really well.\n\n3. By using up to 5 hashtags (like #foryou and #explore and niche ones) we get way more views. Also showing human faces, even if AI generated, helps a lot.\n\n4. Then just post like crazy and DON‚ÄôT stop consistent uploads. We posted almost 1,000 videos between April and June. Average view per video was 16k views but that meant some were 800 views and some were 2m.\n\n5. Don‚Äôt put all your hopes on any 1 video. It‚Äôs a numbers game. We posted an average of 16 videos a day across 8 pages. For the first 15 days things looked bleak and it was barely breakeven. Then by day 41 we hit a viral winner. 4 days later another one because once you go viral once on a specific topic / brand it‚Äôs easier to get views. There‚Äôs more awareness around it now.\n\n6. Just keep it simple and rinse and repeat. This beats dumping all your money into Meta and hoping the algorithm treats you well. Also our viral videos ended up becoming some of the top ads for this brand who reused them in paid campaigns.\n\nIf anyone has questions, ask away. Good luck in Q4 everyone!",

          "body": "Oh man!!! What a question (great question!). Where do I start????\n\nI run an AI and Automation agency (no intention to plug, but just providing you context to my answer). I have a fair amount of experience in this area and the answer to your question is, it 'depends'. Sorry, probably not what you wanted to hear, but it is what it is.\n\nWe audited all of our manual workflows, and in 80% of the cases, we ended up building custom workflows using n8n, real and gumloop etc.. I would honestly advise you do this. Otherwise you will be chasing your tail with new tools every day and week - which is not feasible if you're trying to focus on growing your business.\n\nBuilding your own workflow will allow you to make it extensible and scalable. You can add more capability as you go. For example, we have MCP servers running on n8n where we continue to plug in more and more additional tools, as the need arises. This gives us massive flexibility. We're in the process of writing a blog automation app. Whilst we could have gone with something like outrank, we decided we wanted more control and specific features built in e.g. anti plagiarism check. We've assessed it should save us at least 4-6 hours per month, once its up and running.\n\nSo - net/net - you need to figure out where you want savings or run a full audit to find inefficiencies - then if you can find something that fits the need 100%, buy it! If you can't find something exact - build it!",

I build websites, optimize, help companies automate their lead flows, handle CPC, analytics, etc, so I spend a lot of time in both web forms and unfortunately, managing my availability calendar.   \n  \nFor a few years now, I have been using CalendarBridge to sync various calendars (recommended by a large client who uses it). My personal Google cal, family calendar, company Outlook 365, and my work availability calendar. Up until recently, I simply shared a single calendar booking page link (synced availability, showed block times, etc) with them and they could book any available time based on availability, instead of the back and forth emails typically relegated to scheduling. I simple got an email saying time was scheduled.\n\nA few months ago, they released an AI meeting scheduling tool (AI Assistant) that I have found priceless and quite time saving. I don't know that it saves 10 hours a week, but it definitely makes things simple, especially when its a group meeting. I send or reply to an email asking about availability, add the assistant email to the cc box and it handles 100% of the scheduling from that point forward with little to no interaction from me, or everyone else on the email.  I named my AI assistant Bridget, and it literally takes over the scheduling, reminders about the meeting, can have discussions with people in email in human tone, etc and helps plan everything around it for me. (Hi, I'm Bridget, Entreprefreak's scheduling assistant... how does Tuesday, July 10th from 3-3:30 pm work for you?)\n\nOne of the companies I work with regularly is a large org who also uses it and when we use the AI scheduler, it literally checks everyone's calendar availability, lets us all know the best date/time for a meeting, adds a video link and puts it on everyone's calendar automatically. Completely replaced round-robin or meeting polls.",

      "selftext": "Hey yall. I read stuff here every now and then and figured I should share my story.\n\nI‚Äôm a software developer that was into it because I saw a future with education technology specifically. \n\nI ended up growing a 125,000 person following on TikTok between 2021-2023 mostly around DEI and tech, while being focused on genuinely teaching people about coding and tech and doing outreach to folks in my culture. \n\nI ended up learning a lot of stuff the hard way. By the time I built my following was around the time I accessed GPT-3 and more or less went all in on edtech entrepreneurship. \n\nIt was honestly super messy at first because GPT user experiences were so new. Around this time was when DEI became less popular, tech layoffs were around the corner and Latino audiences more or less shifted toward outrage politics unfortunately. \n\nI mostly grinded out making fairly unpopular videos. I actually learned that going semi-viral (10k-500k views) didn‚Äôt really produce too many conversions, even with followings.\n\nThat‚Äôs when I started to realize more and more what sales was - personal, targeted and volume. So about of my conversions came from 200-1k view videos actually. \n\nSo far my biggest struggle was that I genuinely care about this stuff, so the disinterest with my following kinda tilts me often. I guess if it matters, I created a system where you can essentially create scholarships with learning. I‚Äôm kinda jaded about talking about how I accomplished that but I‚Äôm proud that I did. \n\nAnyway, I sold $1 subscriptions for a while and folks that cared suggested that I open up $3 and $8 subscriptions too which honestly kept things afloat. So it was cool to learn that people are just there to support too when you‚Äôre being genuine and hard working. \n\nAfter a while, working against the current, I started to explore more with pricing and learned people were willing to pay $10, $2, $25 and even $50/mo subscriptions which was very validating. It meant that I was getting better at creating products worth paying for. \n\nBasically it was the same amount of work selling something for $1 as it was $20, and I learned a lot about how edtech pricing influences outcomes and consumer psychology. \n\nThese days I more or less ‚Äúfinished‚Äù developing and putting passion into that project so I‚Äôve made it free as a value-add and moved onto another product after learning about consumer psychology and edtech resistance, which is language learning. \n\nI haven‚Äôt executed on marketing and sales on it yet but I figure that after everything I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôll generally be easier to convert folks because it‚Äôs more aligned with where my consumer base currently is. I‚Äôm hoping to eventually reach $10k/mo sometime in the next year or two. \n\nWell. Thanks for coming to my ted talk. If you haven‚Äôt any questions I‚Äôm happy to check in and answer them even though I don‚Äôt really use Reddit too often anymore. ",

          "body": "Let me counter your philosophizing with some experience based knowledge.\n\nSo there's this program called **Techstars Startup Weekend**, which is a 3 day business idea hackathon - designed to compress the incubator or accelerator program experience into a single weekend. \n\nOver the past decade **I've led 80 Startup Weekend events** throughout the US, Canada, and Australia. These events attract very interesting people - technical, creative, entrepreneurial, industry experts - you name it. \n\nAt each of these events, I typically hear **40 to 50 business idea pitches** on the first night, then watch around 10 teams of 4-5 people attempt to do customer discovery, build MVPs, and variously execute on these ideas, then finally deliver investor style pitches to panels of judges. Are you doing the math? That's a decent sample size of founders and ideas. \n\nSome of them don't get very far during a single weekend; others finish with functional products and even sales. But most of them at least get through 1 or 2 rounds of customer discovery with real humans (no silly online surveys). And that's where ideas meet the market and real learning begins. That's where founders learn to let go of their \"idea\" for a solution and discover how other people experience the problem they think they're solving. 99% of the time they discover they had made significant false assumptions and their \"idea\" must change or it's unlikely to reliably find paying customers. \n\nIt's their investigation of the problem that surfaces insights into solution ideas and that's where value creation begins to form.\n\nWanna know what I've observed about ideas? \n\nI see the same ideas over and over and over. I've literally listened to thousands of idea pitches, and it's now extremely rare that I hear a new idea. It's fairly common for Startup Weekend attendees to be nervous about sharing their idea. Sometimes they take me aside and tell me about their idea, and why they're afraid someone will steal it. Then I proceed to tell them about several other teams that I've worked with on the same idea, and the things they've learned, what worked and didn't, and it's easy to show them that the best thing they could possibly do is to talk about their idea with a variety of people and try to build a team. \n\n**The team is far more important** than the idea.  \nWith a great team, the idea can change and you'll be able to execute. A great idea is worthless if you don't have a team, or have a bad team. The best way to find great team members is to talk to lots of people about the problem you want to solve and get some awesome people involved. You can't do that by hiding your idea. \n\n**Your idea is not unique.**  \nLook up \"multiple discovery\" or \"simultaneous invention\" and understand that for every idea we have there are hundreds of innovative people around the world having the same idea. As technology and society evolve, all of our creative minds are working on the same problems, with the same tools and limitations. Old problems get solved and create new ones. New problems arise from new circumstances. You're not the only one who noticed. The things that will differentiate between all of the innovators are not the idea itself, but their skills, flexibility, connections, access to resources, etc. \n\nBut... but... you can't find your idea online? You did some Google searches? LOL That's because the other folks working on it have either failed and their stuff isn't online any more, or they've done such a poor job describing it so far that it's hard to search for, or they're working in a different language, and you only searched in English, or they're like you: hiding. But I promise you it's not because your idea is unique. \n\nNow I can tell a hundred stories about people who boldly pitched their idea to a room full of a hundred strangers, formed a team, fell in love with the process, and built a successful company. The people who were too scared to share their idea? ...I never heard of them again.\n\n**Execution Starts with Discovery**  \nPeople love quotes like \"ideas are a dime a dozen...\" but this leaves out something critical. The really important thing is to learn what good execution looks like. It begins by genuinely investigating the problem with real humans, using a method like Steve Blank's Customer Development, or Rob Fitzpatrick's Mom Test. \n\nSo here's a more complete quote, from **Sam Altman**:  \n\n&gt;_\"Ideas themselves are not worth anything,_  \n&gt;_only executing well is what creates value._  \n&gt;_Execution gets divided into two key questions:_  \n&gt;_1. Can you figure out what to do?_  \n&gt;_2. Can you get it done?_\"",

      "selftext": "*Can send proof to mods if needed*\n\n**TL;DR:** Started a non-toxic home scent company because our founders kid is allergic to everything. Got screwed by China twice, had to learn manufacturing on the fly, dealt with product getting damaged in transit and defective products while sitting on 4,000 backorders. Somehow grew from $10K to $182K in 5 months anyway. Just got our first massive B2B deal.\n\n# How this started:\n\nOur founder and I have tried this before. We've launched two products together that totally flopped. I also ran a solo ecommerce thing that did six figures a year. He's done like 10+ businesses over the years - some worked, most didn't.\n\nHis daughter has crazy bad allergies. Like, almost everything. We figured if she had this problem, other people probably did too. Did some research, talked to people, and yeah - there was real demand for a non-toxic scent solution that actually worked.\n\nSo we decided to go for it.\n\n# Pre-launch was the only thing that didn't suck\n\nOur entire strategy was: be obsessively helpful and don't bullshit people.\n\nThat's it. We answered every question fast, were super upfront about our timeline, told the story about his daughter, and just tried to build trust before we had a product.\n\nPre-orders started coming in and we were pumped.\n\nThen literally everything broke.\n\n# Months -3 to 0: Getting absolutely wrecked\n\nThe tariff stuff hit and our shipment from China got delayed 3 months. Okay, frustrating but whatever.\n\nThen it finally shows up and it's completely wrong.\n\nLike, we had MULTIPLE meetings with these manufacturers. We told them their samples had defects. They sent us more samples with the same defects. We said \"this isn't right, don't make these.\"\n\nThey made thousands of them anyway.\n\nAt this point we have people who gave us money and we have two options: give it all back or figure out how to make this ourselves.\n\nWe chose chaos. Completely redesigned the product and started manufacturing in-house while having absolutely no idea what we were doing.\n\nThe only reason people didn't mass-refund is because we were honest about everything. \"Hey, we're screwed, here's why, here's what we're doing about it, we'll keep you updated.\" Most people stuck around.\n\n# Month 1-2: Everything is on fire ($10K ‚Üí $18K)\n\nWe finally launch with our homemade version.\n\nImmediately:\n\n* The scent formula is causing issues with materials\n* Packages are getting damaged in transit\n* The scent isn't up to our standards\n* Customers are (rightfully) pissed\n\nEvery single day was just damage control. Apologizing, explaining, replacing products, trying to keep people from giving up on us.\n\nWe completely redesigned the product. Again.\n\nBrought on 3 people to help with warehouse stuff in month 3 because we were drowning. It's just me and him running everything - I handle all the tech, marketing, customer service, and operations. He handles production, suppliers, managing the warehouse crew, and money stuff. We both do strategy.\n\n# Month 3-4: The customs nightmare ($26K ‚Üí $58K)\n\nOkay so we finally have the product working. We pull everything to switch to a better formula and new scents that won't suck.\n\nOur supplier's ingredients get stuck in customs. Month and a half delay.\n\nDuring that delay? **4,000 orders come in.**\n\nThis might have been the worst part. We had people's money, we had demand going crazy, and we physically could not ship anything. Every day was just \"hey we're still waiting on customs, I promise we haven't forgotten about you.\"\n\nThe transparency thing saved us again. People were frustrated but most understood.\n\n# Month 5-6: Holy shit it's actually working ($182K ‚Üí $124K)\n\nIngredients finally show up. We absolutely grind through the 4,000 order backlog.\n\nAlso launched 3 other supplemental products during all this (each with their own problems but nothing compared to the main product disaster).\n\nProduct quality is finally good. People are happy. Word of mouth starts happening.\n\nThen we get a random cold email from a massive company in our space. Like $100M+ revenue massive. They think 60% of their customers would want our product and want to work together.\n\nWe're currently working out the contract details and trying not to jinx it.\n\nIn month 6 we scaled back ads on purpose to laser focus on profitability and still did $124K.\n\n# The numbers\n\n**How we got customers:** Meta ads (Founder and I run them)\n\n**Price:** $40 per unit, AOV \\~60$\n\n**Rough monthly orders:**\n\n* Month 1: \\~300\n* Month 2: \\~500\n* Month 3: \\~500\n* Month 4: \\~973\n* Month 5: \\~2895\n* Month 6: \\~1862 (we intentionally pulled back)\n\n# Why we didn't die\n\n**Being brutally honest when things went wrong**\n\nPeople can handle bad news. They can't handle being lied to or ignored. Every time something broke, we just told everyone exactly what was happening.\n\n**Treating customer service like it was the actual product**\n\nWe were fast, we were empathetic, and we actually cared. A lot of frustrated customers became our biggest fans just because we didn't treat them like ticket numbers.\n\n**Being stupid enough to not quit**\n\nWhen the China thing fell through, we could have just refunded everyone and moved on. Instead we decided to teach ourselves manufacturing in real time like idiots. Worked out though.\n\n**Not shipping shit products**\n\nWe literally pulled profitable inventory because it wasn't good enough. It hurt short-term but people trusted us more for it.\n\n**Actually understanding the problem**\n\nMy partner's daughter is our target customer. We weren't guessing at what people needed - we lived it.\n\n# What we'd definitely do different\n\nDon't take pre-orders until you've actually manufactured at scale. We got lucky people stayed. That could have gone way worse.\n\nHave backup suppliers for everything. Every delay almost killed us because we had no redundancy.\n\nTell people things will take longer than you think. We were way too optimistic with timelines.\n\nHire warehouse help sooner. We were drowning in boxes for way too long.\n\n# Actual lessons if you're doing something similar\n\nYou can survive almost anything if people trust you. Our product was literally defective, we had multi-month delays, packages were exploding - and we still grew. Only worked because we never lied and never went silent.\n\nFix your operations before you scale ads. Our marketing worked great but it would have destroyed us if we couldn't actually ship a good product.\n\nYour manufacturer will probably disappoint you. Just assume it and have a plan B ready.\n\nPivoting isn't the same as failing. Switching to in-house manufacturing felt like we were starting over and admitting defeat. It was actually the thing that saved everything.\n\n# What's next\n\nTrying to close this B2B deal without messing it up. If it works out, we'll have a real wholesale channel instead of just selling direct.\n\nWe're finally making enough profit to actually pay ourselves and invest in proper systems instead of just duct-taping everything together.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the Meta ads approach, how we set up manufacturing, keeping customers during massive delays, how AI helped us handle customer service, or whatever else.",

There were times I had products or projects that should have failed due to suppliers, logistics, or cash flow but sticking to radical transparency with customers and pushing through the chaos kept things moving forward. Like your team, I know how draining it is to juggle every role and keep customers loyal through honest communication and exceptional care.\n\nFrom your experience, three powerful insights stand out: first, extreme honesty builds trust even in bad situations, people respect and stay with you when you don‚Äôt hide problems. Second, treating customer service as the core product creates lifelong fans; empathy and responsiveness make frustrated buyers turn into advocates. Third, resilience beats perfection, pivoting or learning on the fly is critical when things go sideways. You stepped into manufacturing without prior experience and that adaptability made the difference between collapse or explosive growth.\n\nAs a coach working with entrepreneurs who face similar struggles, I appreciate how your story highlights authenticity and grit as growth multipliers. If you want support in refining operations, managing customer relationships strategically, or scaling sustainably, I‚Äôm here to help. Keep leaning into that transparency and resilience because that‚Äôs the foundation of lasting success. The key insight is that challenges will come but how you face them openly and persistently defines your trajectory.\n\nAustin Erkl - Entrepreneur Coach",

But I rarely socialize, and when I do I want to talk about what I'm working on.\n\nKeep in mind, if you're doing things right, it's an obsession. No one else will feel the same about it as you because it's truly special. When you dive deep into something, it's hard to bring anyone else along with you. Having a co-founder helps a ton, because you can have discussions with them and you're usually on the same page. However even then, you're working hard and rarely taking breaks to chat and have fun.\n\nIf you're in the same age range as me (I'm 22), then it's likely that your friends are out there partying or spending their 20s having fun. Others might be in college working towards a degree. Many of them are doing both. You're going in a different direction than them, and it will take you to a different place.\n\nA lot of it is finding your people. There are people out there who think similar to you, who have the same level of passion, and have similar interests. Find those people, treasure those relationships, and build them. Sometimes \"the grind\" isn't just working, it's actively building up a network of interesting people. The benefit isn't just friendship, but also each persons' unique skillset and insight that they can bring. However, this means finding \\*the right\\* people.\n\nThese are some of my thoughts on that matter, which has helped because this line of work can feel incredibly isolating. However, I'll leave you with this poem from Charles Bukowski: [https://hellopoetry.com/poem/68266/roll-the-dice/](https://hellopoetry.com/poem/68266/roll-the-dice/)  \n...\n\nif you‚Äôre going to try,  \ngo all the way.  \nthere is no other feeling like  \nthat.  \nyou will be alone with the  \ngods  \nand the nights will flame with  \nfire.\n\n...",

You either get things rolling yourself or find someone that will help you learn the ropes. \n\nEither work at a startup, start your own, or do nothing. That's all you can really do. The advice is take action now. If you don't know what to do at all, find some project to join.\n\nEdit: these people are saying not to rush and to relax because you're young... You're actually in THE prime time. Things don't just \"start to happen\" after 30. I actually kind of think your 30s are massively set by your 20s. You can't compare an experienced 30yo entrepreneur to a 30yo whose never done anything and is just starting to consider it with the \"I've always wanted to... (But never did)\" and they also won't understand how the 30yo has done so much by that age too, whether it be good or bad. It's different and often by choice, because people think to use this time doing anything but what they dream of because they're \"young\"... And then they're approaching their 40s wishing they got the time of their 20s again to experiment and burn like a fireball. Many highly successful people I've known set their track in their 20s by large. I've seldom met 30+ who magically started and \"made it\" so to say. Most of them were into whatever thing it was to be by their 20s. Late 20s to early 30s \"settling in\" to whatever they started early 20s and 30s to REALLY kick it (as opposed to merely starting...). Also most people may say to \"build around what your job teaches you\" as if you \"need a job\" to learn how to build a company. To first \"work a few years and get experience\" so you'll \"have a better chance\". Not needed. Nope. They might as well say to you \"you need to learn to think INside the box\". They're also the same people who tell you you'll fail 80% time and to stick to your 9-5 in the future. Don't listen to everyone and listen only to the right people. \n\nStart now is what I'd say, only real world will show you doors and your hands the ropes",

Get all agreements in writing (leases etc) and, crucially, keep a copy and backups of that copy.  Keep all important documentation in the cloud and/or a fireproof safe and invest in lethal and non-lethal protection and appropriate training. You don‚Äôt wanna get steamrolled. And don‚Äôt leave sensitive documentation like banking paperwork out, ever. Don‚Äôt leave your guard down around your relatives or close friends either, especially. \n\nRenters insurance, business insurance, car insurance, keep copies of your lease, lock your doors, leave an air tag in your car in case it‚Äôs stolen, set up autopay for all accounts, etc etc. Maybe pre-emptively break the ice with an attorney in case you ever need one. Get creative when thinking of how things can go wrong, including emergent possibilities and simultaneous failure, unlawful behavior, etc, and aim to reduce this risk surface as much as you can. As an entrepreneur you‚Äôre going to be taking on a lot of risk so you need to manage it well and reduce it where you can. Start with your own life. \n\nBeing on the receiving end of criminal behavior can set you back years and you‚Äôre unlikely to get any justice. Protect yourself from this as well as plain ol‚Äô bad luck as best you can, it‚Äôs nearly free to do so (renters insurance is like $7/mo, a safe is like $30 and guns are cheap). Always assume multiple bad things will happen simultaneously and have contingency plans to be prepared for various scenarios (eg, lost your job AND totaled your car same time). After that you can address all the usual platitudes like ‚Äúfail fast‚Äù etc at your leisure.\n\nIn essence it‚Äôs important to realize you are solely responsible for protecting and defending yourself and your assets against a world full of liars, thieves and criminals who will destroy everything you‚Äôve built and extort you into nothing, and that when you need it, the police will be of no help and getting an attorney, let alone enough evidence for a solid case, can be impossible.

Then you can really find the pain points or a niche that no one else is willing to service or is found yet.",

What you actually need is the ability to work 60-hour weeks without burnout and recover fast from failures.\n\n**Build skills that compound.** Sales, copywriting, basic coding, understanding ads - these stack. A certification in something trendy does not compound the same way.\n\n**Your network at 25 will determine your opportunities at 35.** Not in a fake LinkedIn way. Actually help people, solve their problems for free sometimes, be the person who connects others. This pays off later in ways you cannot imagine now.\n\n**Validate before you build.** Sell the thing before you make it. Get 10 people to pay you before you quit your job. Most startup failures come from building something nobody wants.\n\n**Cheap living = runway.** If you can live on 1500 dollars a month instead of 3000, you just doubled how long you can work on your business before needing results. Geographic arbitrage is real.\n\n**Focus on revenue, not funding.** A business making 5k/month profit that you own 100% beats a funded startup where you own 20% and have a boss (investors). Bootstrap as long as possible.\n\n**Document everything.** The lessons you learn failing at 23 become the expertise you sell at 30. Write it down, even if nobody reads it now.\n\nMost importantly: Start now, even if imperfect. The difference between starting at 20 vs 25 is enormous. Five extra years of lessons compounds hard.",

On top, one of my employee also left the job without prior notice today. This is the second time someone left like that this month. \n\nThis has happened to me so many times in the past 3 years of me running the business that today I didn't feel anything. I have been handling everything extremely camly. Infact my manager told me that he even noticed that since past few days, and it encouraged him to be less stressed too.\n\nFor me though, and I don't know the reason why, I have absolutely zero stress. I have never been this calm ever with my business, especially when losing majority of the business and almost at the point of going bankrupt. \n\nI am seeing everything as just events, and not like some catastrophes. If this had happened to be an year ago, I would have been completely stressed and in tears by now.\n\nI have been practising power of now, and also recently started reading the book don't believe everything you think. I guess these two things had a profound impact on me that I haven't realized yet.\n\nAs they say, pain is inevitable but suffering is optional, holds so true today. I am choosing not to suffer in my thoughts, and whatever I learned from my practise seems to be absolutely working. This feels like some kind of superpower. I can now (hopefully) stay calm under anything.\n\nAnyways, I have like a year of savings and I am moving to Bali next month. To be honest, I feel a bit relieved that my business has went down. I feel lighter, and can now do whatever I want. I just want to BE for now, no rushing into anything else. Just exist. Thoughts? ",

You're right that having competitors validates the market, but wrong about the positioning part.\n\nSaying \"unlike other tools, we don't charge per seat\" only works if that's actually a pain point your customers care about. Most of the time founders pick differentiators that sound good but don't actually matter to buyers.\n\nWhat worked for us was talking to customers who chose competitors over us and asking why. Turned out our \"unique feature\" we were proud of wasn't important. What they actually wanted was faster implementation. So we rebuilt our onboarding and led with that.\n\nThe real issue isn't being scared of competitors. It's building in a vacuum and guessing what makes you different instead of letting the market tell you. Your differentiation has to solve a real problem people are actively frustrated with, not just be theoretically better.\n\nAlso, obsessing over competitors is a trap. I wasted months analyzing their features when I should've been talking to my own customers. They don't care about your competitive matrix. They care if you solve their problem better than doing nothing.",

You're converting time into revenue at minimum wage rates while working 80+ hour weeks. Your capital is your sanity, and you're spending it recklessly.\n\nThe actual path? Services. Always services. Freelance consulting, web dev, content creation.. anything where you can invoice within 30 days. Products and SaaS bleed cash for months before you see a dime. With services, you're cashflow positive in weeks, then you can funnel that into something scalable.\n\nPlatforms like Upwork or Fiverr take a commission, but they're essentially free lead generation. Build credibility there, then migrate clients off-platform once you've proven you're not incompetent. After about 6 months of this grind, you'll have enough revenue to justify a proper business structure and start hiring.\n\nReal talk though.. if you're worried about phone charging costs, you're not ready.

Upwork, Fiverr type stuff to start, then direct clients once you have proof.\n\nThe actual constraint isn't money, it's whether you can generate value before running out of runway. Service businesses let you test that immediately because you get paid for delivery, not after building and marketing a product.\n\nProfitability depends on pricing power, which comes from specialized skills or deep domain expertise, not the business model itself.",

      "selftext": "She has reached about $4000 /mo, of course it fluctuates based on demand and scaling it to a bigger business is kind of up in the air right now since it'd mean hiring more people and turning it into more \n\n\n\nWhat she's doing is essentially formatting research papers for uni researchers or people in their master's degree, basically fixing APA format rules and general grammar (she would be very upset about al the grammar rules I'm probably breaking in this post), my girlfriend has already been doing this for years now but she's got a lot of free time now and only working hourly at an university so we decided to scale it a bit more and try to see where it would go.\n\n\n\nI've worked in marketing and sales before and even though this kind of service or any service in academia moves essentially through word of mouth i decided to give cold emailing a try, I've used cold emailing services before and I know researchers and people in academia in general reply to emails and are just more aware of their inbox and don't receive the kind of spam that people in B2B do so I decided to give cold emailing a go and created a relatively simple campaign using Skyp and cold emailing made a significant impact in breaking the $1000/mo barrier.\n\n\n\nNow I don't think that could be applicable to most side hustles but hey, it creates a domino effect where people get a good service then it kickstarts a word of mouth in an university or group of researchers we literally could've never gotten close to and that's where the extra business comes from.\n\n\n\nIf you're in academia or studying a masters or a PhD in the sciences or humanities and you're good at editing documents and applying stuff like APA, MLA, Chicago. I'd honestly encourage you to give this a try. If you know physics or mathematics there's also a pretty good demand we've seen but my significant other doesn't really take those gigs as she's more focused in the humanities and they are usually pretty heavy work (which means that if you can fill this niche you could probably charge more).\n\n\n\nAnother thing is: bots suck at doing this! And researchers are very very wary of using it on their research papers and would much rather pay a person to check their work. So even if it magically improves overnight and figures this out there will still be demand. A lot of requests are fixing very stupid and easy to fix bot mistakes, specially from papers that come from students.",

We get Bronze plans because we're in our lower 40s and very healthy.  We are the farthest thing from rich but we're over the 400% of poverty line threshold.  \n\nOur premium now is a manageable $600/mo for a plan with a $15k deductible.  Next year it's estimated to go to $1600 per month.  That's nearly 20% of our income on...nothing.  We get our yearly checkups, and occasionally have to call in about meds for tick bites because we live in a rural area.  \n\nI know lots of people older than us have it way worse too.  People in their 50s and early 60s pay insane amounts for coverage.  Why are we putting up with this???  Just lining the pockets of executives and going broke in the process.  \n\nI know there is talk of extending the enhanced subsidies but I don't really have my hopes up about it.  ",

          "body": "Context: I run my own company. Actually, a couple of them. But I have been a sales guy and technologist (developer) for over 30 years. So I am going to advise you from the perspective of thinking about things strategically.\n\nYour constraints:\n\n1. They are one of your only clients (you are very dependent)\n2. \"Small tweaks\" - not sure if 1 week is a small tweak in your industry?\n3. What you have delivered does not meet their needs/desires - hence the request for small tweaks.\n\nWhat you really want is a conversation to answer the following questions:\n\n1. Does your client see you as disposable and therefore can pressure you to put in a week of work for free?\n2. Are you selling and positioning what you do as high value? In other words is it rare?\n3. Are you exceeding your clients needs? Or are you missing the mark and they believe that they are owed this work because you did not meet their needs?\n4. Can you flip the script to help them understand that you want to keep them as a client, you are high value and you are not desperate.\n5. How do you become so valuable that when they ask for work for free, they believe you are family and therefore every new contract will flow in your direction. In other words, you do this - and I will never leave.\n\nSo how do you answer these questions:\n\n1. Do they know you have very few clients? If so, why are you marketing this idea to them in the first place? You should always be marketing how scarce your time is. Therefore, your time is extremely valuable. I see so many business owners constantly fall into this trap when they are trying to please a client. It demonstrates weakness.\n2. How do you position yourself, do you drop price when they apply pressure? Or do you exchange a discount for other concessions from them?\n3. Ask the question as follows - \"Hey xyz - I realize that you all need these 'small tweaks' and we want you to be completely satisfied with the finished product. I do have some questions so we can improve our work product moving forward. The small tweaks you are asking for is a week of work on our side which is 20k/30k whatever it happens to be. The money is not an issue. You all are a fantastic client. However, when you require additional work pro bono (do not say free), it typically means we (you are taking responsibility) missed the mark. Where do you think we went wrong?\" This is an open ended question and allows the client to really think about what they are asking for. Maybe they even realize that they could have done things better.\"\n4. After question 3 is answered, and this is forward looking - \"I just took on a few new clients and we are hiring some additional folks. You are our top priority given our abc years together. So don't worry, we will make things happen. However, I am going to need some flexibility as we ramp.\" Yes this is bullshit. But guess what - a) you need to ramp and get some new clients so this never happens again. b) you create scarcity and he/she realizes you are the hot girl at the bar/club. It forces them to recalibrate. It also gives you time to work on getting new clients instead of putting all your time into free work. Which is a real problem in the consulting business. If you are fulfilling contracts, you are not selling. You need to either hire someone to do the work, or hire someone to sell if you never want to be here again.\n5. \"hey xyz - glad we are on the same page. What new initiatives are you planning?\" You just gave them 1 week of free work. He/she owes you. This is the time to ask for that work to be handed to you.\n\nHope this helps.",

This is a less common but highly profitable way. You can cross sell therefore to add clientele to your books and increase profitability across both (if it is within your ability to do.

If you do it once, they will come to expect it. You will start doing it for other clients. Any referred business will come to expect it. Doing free work is a race to the bottom, and there's only one closer. You.\n\nYou can't make up a loss with volume. I learned this the hard way. I had to fire several long-time clients because I was losing too much money keeping them all happy.\n\n&gt;2. Based on your experience, what would you do if you were me right now?\n\nSay no. Explain that this is out of the scope of the original project (you have a contract, right???). At most, offer them a discount because you didn't set expectations properly.\n\nFor future reference, this is a you problem. Set expectations on scope creep so there is no question what the client is due and what they will pay extra for. Include a detailed scope of work in the contract.\n\nAs a side note, a week of work is NOT a couple of tweaks in any world. Even if you only bill $50/hr, that's still $2000 of labor.",

I'm talking about sole props that take home 40-100k a year.\n\nThe consensus among them seems to be that being self employed is somehow \"riskier\" than being employed.\n\nBut even if you have been in business 10 years and have proven successful, you are still seen as risky.\n\nThe other thing that irritates me is they all want to go off your tax returns and not your bank statements.\n\nA lot of things are legally written off. Mileage, cost of goods, you name it. Some of these are expenses, some aren't.\n\nIf regularly employed folks were allowed to deduct their meals, mileage, cell phone bill, work uniforms, etc then their income would appear lower as well.  \n\nBut they still only look at adjusted gross income or AGI. \n\nEven if you made $70,000 and only had $20,000 in actual expenses, but legally wrote off another $30k in deductions (just an example), your AGI is only $20,000 which isn't very much.\n\nIf you took home $70k working for a company, but spent $20k on travel expenses, mileage, meals, cell phone, internet, uniforms, work shoes, tools, you name it, the bank STILL only looks at that $70k figure.\n\nHow on earth is that fair? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

These companies employ actuaries who draw from massive historical data to determine risk levels for insurance premiums and loan rates.  So they look at all the loans ever given and focus down on self employed people and see higher rates of default.  It's just that simple.  \n\nLet's say you get cancer, 1 in 12 adults in the US get this news every year.  You work for a major company with good benefits and you get PTO for care visits, high quality insurance, and FMLA benefits from an insurance company that pays you partial income while you are completely incapacitated.  If you die you also have a term life plan provided by your employer.  If a bank loans this guy money the chances that he lives long enough and has the income to pay the loan back are pretty good.  \n\nIf they loan you money and you're a $60k a year sole prop doing physical labor with no disability or workman's comp insurance they are taking on several orders of magnitude more risk.  So much risk they would rather avoid lending to you at all.  They know you're one bad day away from never being able to pay them.  You may disagree but they don't care.  \n\nIt's unfair and life sucks.  Welcome to rugged individualism in a capitalist society.  Good luck out there.",

I guess the moral of the story is not to try to boil the ocean, take it slow, build your business and go from there.",

I always wanted to start a REAL business though, so I watched some videos and vending machines seemed like a good idea and something real. So I found a couple locations and put about 7k into it (buying the machines). It was scary af, I had no idea what I was doing but cant learn if you dont try. Well, I got them set up and ran them for 6 months, I didn't like it so I sold them and made a small good profit. Then I made a Etsy shop and did very well for a few years, trying different products and found a couple things that sold VERY well. By that time I had enough saved up to buy my first investment property, so I did that, still scared af and had no idea what I was doing....\n\nYou just have to start somewhere, if you are smart and do it the right way, it's kinda hard to lose money. You will learn a ton and find out what you like and dont like. I always suggest starting small and growing slowly. The real trick is, you just have to start!",

Any questions you‚Äôre confused about, just google it and there will be a layman‚Äôs term translation (might be more tax advantageous to start it in another state for the sake of simplicity just do your own state)\n\n- after you get your articles of incorporation, go to IRS website and apply for EIN (another quick process) \n\n- then get a business license from your city. You should be able to apply online at your local .gov. You can the local licensing division to get assistance \n\n- then get a business bank account from a bank of your choosing\n\n- Lastly, sign up for a free bookkeeping/invoicing site like Wave. Bookkeeping and knowing your numbers is CRITICAL. The earlier you set your books up, the easier/cleaner it will be.\n\nAfter your legal presence is established, next you want to establish an online presence so that you can easily market &amp; feel like a ‚Äúreal business.‚Äù \n\n- Use canva to create a simple logo and a few starter images for marketing purposes\n\n- Set up social media pages (Facebook, tik tok, IG being the main ones)\n\n- start a website and use same language &amp; pictures from social media pages (be consistent across all platforms)\n\n- start a google business page \n\nThis process of creating/setting up always helps me form my marketing vision &amp; taglines vs sitting down with a business plan and writing out ideas. \n\nThis next part is arguable because many people say leave family &amp; friends out of it but not me. Once you have legal &amp; online presence, tell your close family &amp; friends that you‚Äôve started a business &amp; ask them to follow your social media pages. \n\nThen ask them to be your first customers. I‚Äôve only done service based businesses, so I generally ask them if I can do a quick service for them at a discounted rate. This accomplishes several things:\n- legal paying customers\n- capture pictures &amp; videos while you do the job for them so you have more content for your online pages\n- request five star reviews from all of them &amp; quickly grow your reputation (technically you can skip to this part and just request reviews but morally speaking it‚Äôs better if they are actual customers) \n\nThen sign up for different leads/marketplace platforms depending on your line of business. If you sell products, then a site like Etsy is a good one. Service businesses can use pay-per-lead  sites like Thumbtack, Angis, Bark, or Yelp (but beware of these; there are legit leads/customers to be had but a lot of scam leads and/or no response).\n\nThen you can graduate to Google, Facebook &amp; IG ads &amp; campaigns.\n\nI personally don‚Äôt start to fill out an actual business plan until I‚Äôve done most of the above. I find it‚Äôs easier to actually complete the business plan after I‚Äôve done the initial setup. Lots more I could add but I think that‚Äôs a good starting point. Hope this helps. Message me if you want to discuss more. Good luck!",

Is it because you hate your day job and believe having your own business will be better?\n\nThe reason I ask is because if have done several businesses and side hustles, most didn't do well and some did excellent. But it was more so what I've learned over time.\n\nThe ones that did really well were some that I was very passionate about and good at. All the ones that tanked were ideas that I wanted to do and looked at as a side hustle, and I thought I could just throw out there and win.\n\nBusiness is challenging, and it requires a specific mindset to succeed in it. Just because you want to doesn't mean you should, and because you should doesn't mean you can. What I mean by that is I've seen countless posts like yours and those from small business owners. I am really passionate about entrepreneurship, BTW, that's why I hang out here. That raises fundamental questions, but then you can see that they are stuck on certain things, and it sometimes explains why they are struggling and not performing well.\n\nHow much do you educate yourself? How dedicated are you to learning new things?\n\nHere an example of where I am getting at:\n\nLet's say you are an excellent chef, and your food is killing it and can compete with the best of them. Does it mean you will be successful with your restaurant? No, not at all\n\nPrimarily, running a restaurant entails 80% of tasks and responsibilities that have nothing to do with the food itself. You need to know accounting, budgeting, marketing, managing people, logistics, customer service, strategy, etc. Those are the things that make or break people. Your product (food) is just your beginning and why, but your how is what makes it happen.\n\nMost people's why is they just want to make money or hate their job, that's not good enough. So understand your why and what, then you can figure out your how. If you why is, I am really good a repairing cars and I love it, gives you your starting basis for your how, now you can focus on how you will set yourself apart from others.",

Yeah ...no. \n\nEvery wantrepreneur knows you don't need money to start. Every businessperson knows the top reason you will *end that business* is running out of money. It is the difference between half-truth and whole truth. \n\nThey all whine about future regret. How a half-assed fling alleviates a sense of regret is the only mystery about the outcome.",

I had to build mine in 2016, when orders from Amazon and Flipkart suffered. \n\nWe only bought a domain and hosting with cpanel, the cheapest as we can spend more if the website takes off.\nThe store was done with prestashop and then months later redone with magento. These were single click install available for free in the hosting cpanel. We also made many subdomain for the team to experiment and play with the many other tools available there.\n\nAfter the single click install, it was just form filling about your data . The product pages were easy for us, as we had a catalog due to our existing Ecom. The rest were the terms page, about us, and many such . \n\nSince we wanted to launch and test the waters first, we did not integrate any shipping provider with the website. We just manually entered the tracking details and sent it to the customer also.\nThen was getting a payment integrator. It's a simple process too. You will need to provide tax details and kyc to the payments processor for this.\n\nFor the https certificates, we used a free 90 day renewal certificate.

Luckily I had Northwest Registered Agent do all my paperwork, but here's the kicker. I called one day to follow up on one of the filings and the rep told me they could secure the domain and build the website for free. Which was friggin awesome cause I didn't have thousands of dollars to invest in getting a website done, I just wanted to get up and running. So they built me a landing page and then I had their tech support help me connect my Shopify to it. I gave them the logo and business info and they did all the heavy lifting, cause if it was up to me, I'd still be banging my head on the desk trying to figure out what a DNS record is. Your business might be different but it actually saved me a ton of work. Idk if they're still running that special but it might be worth it to at least call and ask some questions.

In fact, some of the people who ghosted me originally became cool with me again after I told them I‚Äôd ‚Äúexaggerated‚Äù my story the first time around.\n\nIt made me realize how unpredictable people‚Äôs reactions can be when you reconnect after years. I thought sharing positive news about business success would be encouraging, but in reality it sometimes made old friends uncomfortable.

Sometimes keeping it simple and focusing on old memories is the better way to reconnect. This kinda reminds me of how some lottery winners have stories of suddenly finding a few of their friends and family members to be resentful of them after winning.\n\n#Edit:\n\nI run a one man web design business where small mom and pop shops and blue collar businesses pay a small fee each month to manage their company websites.

Just a little something that lays out your ideas and goals, who you think your customers may be, what problem you are solving, how you plan on reaching your customers, and what it might cost you to get started. Then start by testing your idea small. You can learn in real time without breaking the bank. This will also give you feedback from your test customers to drive your product upgrades to what actually works. Once things start to take off, you then can invest more and expand as you go.",

      "selftext": "**Has anyone else gone through something like this with American Express?**  If so, I would love to know **how to deal with this issue**, I will be contacting them tomorrow (Monday) morning. If you have dealt with it, how did you resolve it?\n\nI‚Äôve been with Amex for over 25 years. Between my business and personal cards, I‚Äôve probably run somewhere between $30‚Äì50 million through them over that time. Never missed a payment. **Never had a problem. I have paid early EVERY month** on my Plum card to receive the cash back. My personal credit score is over 800.  My business has been more profitable every year it has been in existence.  There should be zero flags to show a problem.\n\nThen out of nowhere, this past Saturday evening around 6:45 PM, I get an email saying my available credit limits have been reduced on all six of my cards. I thought it had to be spam. Logged in and it was real. Every single card had its limit cut dramatically, some by as much as 90%.\n\nThat instantly made several cards show as ‚Äúover limit‚Äù by tens of thousands of dollars, even though I hadn‚Äôt made a new charge. Just because Amex decided to lower the limit after the balance was already there.  No warning, no explanation. Just an email after hours on a weekend.\n\nNow I have personal cards showing a balance greater than the credit limit, which will negatively impact my credit score if the credit bureau happens to pull the data today.\n\nSo I called the number on the back of the card and got sent to a recording saying underwriting was closed until Monday morning. There was no way to get past that prompt once I put my card info in.  They sent the email ten minutes after they closed, so there was literally no way to talk to anyone. Perfect timing, right?\n\nNow imagine if I were traveling internationally or needed those cards to cover scheduled payments. Too bad. They just stop working. Some of mine already declined Sunday morning for pending charges, and of course Amex won‚Äôt be covering any fees or fallout from that.\n\nI tried the chat on their site, spent 15 minutes explaining everything, only to be told I needed to call a ‚Äúspecial number‚Äù where someone could help me as a ‚Äúlong time valued customer.‚Äù I called it, and got the same voicemail saying to try again Monday.  Valued customer...right.\n\nSo here I am, 25 years of loyalty, perfect history, and six suddenly crippled accounts that I can‚Äôt even use because someone at Amex flipped a switch and didn‚Äôt think about what that does to small business owners who rely on those cards every day.\n\nIf this can happen to me, it can happen to any of you. And it raises real questions about how Amex handles risk, or maybe just their cash exposure, without giving long-time customers any warning or chance to prepare.\n\nFor small business owners, this is something to think about before making Amex your main line of credit. Because ‚Äúmember since 1998‚Äù apparently doesn‚Äôt mean much when their algorithm or someone working risk on a weekend decides to cut you off on a Saturday night.",

This usually will be information from credit reporting agencies.\n\nWith Amex usually it's because something triggered an in depth review of at least one account. When this happens Amex will usually do a hard pull on credit report and going by what they find results can be what has happened to OP. Credit limits reduced, cards closed, etc....\n\nOf course when one account is affected it prompts action with all others someone has with Amex, again Citi and other CC issuers all do same thing.\n\nKeep in mind it may not be something one has done with Amex (or Citi or whoever) that triggers these sort of actions. Simply pulling hard credit report and finding something they don't like recently with any other credit related bit on report can trigger actions.\n\nThat is to say if one CC issuer (say Amex) finds account holder has high utilization, missed payments, and or anything else they view as negative with another bank or CC they can take action.",

Like now instead of being stressed about delivering I'm stressed about training people to do the work. We had this new guy just joining. Seemed smart with good portfolio and spoke well during interview. I put off a complete day to talk to him about everything that we do. Tools we use, our process, file organization.. like all of it. He's proactive, asking questions and taking notes which made me think \"finally a good candidate amongst them\".Next day he calls me over to his desk and ask me something about where we keep docs which I clearly explained to him yesterday. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. It took him just a day to forget that? And it's not just him because someone who's been here a month still sends email to the wrong person.. and there's MANY cases like that!  \nMy business partner says we need \"better documentation\" but WHEN? I'm answering the same questions on repeat being behind on client work and starting to get sharp with people who are just trying to learn.  \nI know this is an investment and that after 6 months they'll be solid. But right now this is very time consuming and not sure if it's worth it. Is this just what having employees is like? Please tell me I'm not the only one losing my mind.",

Imagine if they had to explain to every customer, verbally, often several times because they forgot some steps and didn't write it down, how to assemble every piece of furniture that ever gets bought.\n\nI never train anyone by *just* explaining to them, verbally, what to do. It's unrealistic to expect them to retain it all. I mean, I know I couldn't remember *everything* the first time someone explained to me about how to do something, so why should I expect anyone else to?\n\nInstead, any time I need to train someone how to do something, I write a thorough instruction sheet listing all the steps and how to do them. I'll print out a few copies of it, so the first few times they do it they can cross off the steps as they do them. Then throw it out and grab a fresh one the next time. Eventually they'll remember all the steps, but in my experience it takes about 3 times doing any task before anyone ever memorizes it all flawlessly. So, if you don't want to have to train this person 3 times for every 1 task, write an instruction sheet, and save yourself (and them) a headache.\n\nIt also makes it VERY easy to train someone again in the future. You'll already have all the instruction sheets made. Suddenly employee turnover becomes less of a problem.",

          "body": "A very important part of training others is staying aware of times when what makes sense to you might not make sense to others.  Sometimes even if your way was hard won from years of experience you might need to find a different way of explaining it to make sense to other people.\n\n\"Productivity tools\" are a trap, in my experience.  For example name suggestions when sending an email, 90% of them will be the wrong name unless you start from an empty database. If you have an address book it will suck an entire asshole for most users.  Like if there are 6 Chris in the book, you might know to type their last name instead of first name, but another employee might not know that and might not realize the suggestions move around.  Yeah, they move around in Outlook, I hate the program. The guy who was the third on the list is now for some reason fourth.\n\nSometimes the best choice for your business is to evaluate if you should even be the one training new recruits.  High performer doesn't mean best trainer.  In fact some of the best trainers I've ever worked with have been \"terrible employees\", but the traits that made them a terrible employee made them a great trainer because they approached it from a low stress mindset and looked for ways to make the task easier.  Like if you spend time menu diving into subfolders, why not pin a shortcut on the desktop and rename it to something that makes sense?\n\nIf you find yourself answering the same questions over and over, forget about the clients, focus on that.  That's the problem maker and spending 2 hours addressing it and making new training documents for it will save you 20 hours this month.\n\nInformation overload is real.  You can't dump years of experience on someone and expect it to stick.  Assign new hires specific tasks.  You can train a new hire on how to politely respond to emails in like 30 minutes.  Give them a single folder of FAQs and tell them to copy and paste and forward emails.  Next week they get a second task, week after that a third task.  Progressively build up their workload at a manageable pace.\n\nPrioritize tasks that occupy the most time for you, or which distract you from the difficult tasks.  Like if you need to keep interrupting your work or call to run to the other side of the building to sign a paper, either move your desk or assign someone to fetch the papers and bring them to you.\n\nWhile SOPs can be good, most of them suck ass.  They're usually way too dry and technical.  Use real world examples, and structure them in the way that they are encountered or used, not alphabetically or anything silly like that.  Take screenshots and circle stuff so people know where to look instead of just saying \"Check the Audit Trails\" or \"Switch to the Identity tab\" because if they forgot where those are they run the risk of clicking into a different menu and getting totally lost.\n\nGet feedback from the employees as you train them, and later on as they gain experience.  Like I said earlier, just because a process or method works for you doesn't mean it works for everyone.  So if 4 out of 8 employees keep struggling with something it's worth addressing whether it can be improved.\n\nFocus on why, not just what.  Often in training why is more important than what.  For example we keep these documents in a completely separate folder structure.  Why?  Because these ones contain confidential information and we don't want to accidentally send them to the wrong person. That's more useful than just rattling off a list of which documents are found in what folder.  If people learn why they can work their way through it.  I need to send a pdf to a client, oh this is the confidential folder, it won't be in  here.  No need to memorize a list of 20 pdfs and who can see them.\n\nA good goal for your training documentation is that a complete stranger should be able to follow along slowly.  My own personal goal is that employees shouldn't even need fluency in English to be able to follow my guides, because honestly half the time it's their second or third or fourth language and technical terms go right out the other ear.  For example on the contact lists for emergencies I structure it as name, number, and why.  So many places just have \"Senior Executive Administrator\" or some other job title, and I don't even know why I'm calling this person.  Much better to include \"Call for water leaks.\"",

Train them, ask them to fill out the training docs, then you review to see if they captured it correctly. If not, invite them over to review what they missed or got wrong and make sure it's clear to everyone.\n\nAs others have said, if anyone on the team discovers something missing, tell them do document it. You can check the document history to see what's new and ask people to review one another on rotation. Maybe even every other Friday as a team you review if anything new has been added and come to a consensus on it, and allow people to ask the questions they're otherwise afraid of asking for pissing you off. You can do the Friday thing like a 1-hour meeting or even have an early happy hour before work formally ends so it feels casual and people are open to sharing ideas.\n\nMy job has literally been doing this for companies.

          "body": "This post comes up a lot. Here's my reply the last time I saw this:\n\n&gt; My background is that I am a senior freelance website architect and full-stack developer. I am a small business owner for over 15 years and I run my own operation. One area of my business is building brochure sites, landing pages, and simple homepages for small businesses. I also build custom solutions for WordPress, and full WordPress websites for small-to-medium size businesses.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If your choice is between Squarespace, Wix, and WordPress, I highly recommend you select WordPress. It is a highly performant blogging platform and content management system. The team who builds it has significant investment and they update it constantly.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Because it's updated so frequently, you do need to perform consistent maintenance and updates, but other than that, it's a stellar platform.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I recommend Wordfence, Contact Form 7, Flamingo, Relevanssi, hCaptcha for WordPress, and WP Super Cache. These plugins are my standard install, and they basically hit every major point you need to worry about. They all have free options available, and do not require paying. The paid options are worth it though. CF7 deserves more donations.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If you are on a strict budget, I would host directly with WordPress.com and choose a nice off-the-shelf theme. For reference, WordPress.org is the free, open source self-hosted version. Most recent themes support the block editor, and you should be good to go. If you're looking at Woocommerce, Storefront is an excellent theme.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I'm not super familiar with Squarespace, but I am intimately familiar with Wix. This past year I was tasked with an emergency job to revamp a Wix site for a client who wanted to host a charity event. It cost the client a significant amount of money; far more than would have been needed if we had gone with my recommendation of a custom WordPress theme and plugin set.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When small business clients come to me asking for consultation, I ask one question:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Do you need to update your website constantly, like posting articles, blogs, events, courses, etc., or do you really just need a brochure site? Most small businesses need a small brochure site, with about 1 hour of maintenance/updates per month.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If you really just need a brochure site, a capable website developer who offers what I offer, static landing pages, is going to be far more effective for your business than managing a content management system. Ask for on-page SEO, and the following integrations: Google Analytics, Search Console Integration, Facebook/Meta pixel, Microsoft Clarity, and a one-way contact form. Your #1 traffic source is going to be Google Business Profile/Maps Integration, so ask if they can consult with you on that too.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Invest in your online presence, but don't get taken for a ride. I would strongly recommend hiring a qualified website developer who you can work with intimately one-on-one, and doesn't pass you off to a random support team. I can't emphasize enough how frustrating working with Wix support was.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nrkd8t/what_is_the_best_website_builder_for_a_small/ngiqb34/",

After that I was good.\n\n(I‚Äôve hired over 80 international people in my time, so I‚Äôve travelled this road a lot. All hired as contractors.

The physical change in these 2 men as their business slowly failed over 1-2 years and collapsed is terrifying.  They are shells of themselves. I am not sure either will recover if im honest. I can see how easy it would be to keep throwing in the effort to trying and savage the situation but the toll they took on themselves I dont think is worth it. \n\nAs small business owner do you think you'd fight until there is nothing left to fight for and go down swinging or throw the towel in sooner and find something else possibly saving your sanity but loosing your business?",

I post 7‚Äì10 times a week, scheduled in advance through Buffer. Not every post is a masterpiece, but showing up consistently has been the biggest driver of engagement for me. Grew from 600 followers to over 1k in less than 2 months. I was sitting on that 600 for years.\n* Focus on conversations, not broadcasts. End posts with a question, jump into comments, and reply to others‚Äô content. Engagement compounds when you show up in people‚Äôs feeds repeatedly.\n* Systematize your content. I recycle core ideas into multiple posts (pain points, lessons, client results, hot takes). It keeps the pipeline full without draining hours every time. Trained GTP also helps.\n* Play the long game. Leads rarely come from a single post. They come when people see you show up week after week and start to trust you as the ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù person in your field.\n\nYes, I get consistent inbound leads now. But it didn‚Äôt start until I made it part of my weekly workflow, instead of an afterthought behind client work.\n\nIf you‚Äôre strapped for time, start with 2‚Äì3 posts a week and batch them.

          "body": "Until this year, I worked at LinkedIn in a capacity that was focused on growing SMB‚Äòs presence on the platform.\n\nHere‚Äôs the thing: LinkedIn doesn‚Äôt work for SMBs. LinkedIn knows that it doesn‚Äôt work for SMBs. LinkedIn even understands why it doesn‚Äôt work for SMBs: there has been a ton of research into this and there is more every year. The only gap is that no one ever does anything about it because SMB‚Äòs are not a big enough revenue source.\n\nLinkedIn is a power user platform. If you want to see value from it, you have to be constantly giving it data and putting more coins in the machine. What LinkedIn calls casual or small scale usage, which is basically any level of usage that doesn‚Äôt involve a person at your company whose entire job is to sit there and use LinkedIn all day, is not going to be very successful.\n\nThe way Linkedin talks internally about SMBs, or anyone who does not want to dedicate massive resources to their platform, is nothing short of contemptuous. I was constantly hearing how SMB owners don‚Äôt know enough or are not expert enough to be successful on the platform, and that was why there was no use and investing in things that would help make them more successful. You will occasionally hear a very senior person talk about product gaps, and everyone on the call will not along, but it never translates into any action.\n\nAt the time I left, the hope was that they were going to pour AI all over everything and that was going to make life better for SMBs somehow. Login and you can see how well that‚Äôs going.\n\nAnyway, I‚Äôm not saying that SMB shouldn‚Äôt use Linkedin because a lot of them do and some of them are successful. If it works for you, you should do it. My only point in posting this is to provide SMB owners with the context that you will have to come to Linkedin and accept that you are betting on a platform that fundamentally doesn‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre around or not. If you are willing to do the work to come to it on its own terms, LinkedIn will be great for you. If not, you‚Äôre way better off somewhere else.",

The sales presentation showed beautiful dashboards, automated workflows, and reporting that would give us insights we'd never had before.\n\nThe reality is that we're still exporting data to excel for any meaningful analysis. The built in reports are too basic for operational decisions and too inflexible for corporate requirements. Want to see revenue by booking source over the last 6 months? Export to spreadsheet and build it yourself.\n\nIntegration between modules is clunky despite being the same platform. Room charges don't automatically appear in the accounting module. Guest preferences from the CRM don't sync with the PMS for front desk visibility. The channel manager updates rates but doesn't sync restrictions properly.\n\nStaff adoption has been slower than expected because workflows that were simple in our old systems now require multiple steps across different modules. Housekeeping managers still keep paper lists because the mobile app is unreliable and slow.\n\nThe most frustrating part is that vendor support keeps saying these limitations will be addressed in \"upcoming releases\" but we've been hearing that for over a year. Meanwhile we're paying monthly fees for software that creates more work than it eliminates.\n\nStarted wondering if we should have stuck with separate best in class solutions instead of trying to consolidate everything into one mediocre platform. The cost savings aren't materializing when we factor in the productivity losses and workaround processes.\n\nAnyone else experienced the gap between integrated software promises and actual performance? How do you evaluate whether consolidation is worth the trade offs in functionality?",
