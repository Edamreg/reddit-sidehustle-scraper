      "selftext": "this started completely by accident like 3 months ago. my mom asked me to help convert some old family VHS tapes to digital and I borrowed this capture device from a friend. took me forever to figure it out but once I did I posted in my neighborhood Facebook group asking if anyone else needed help with theirs.\n\nhonestly thought maybe 2 or 3 people would respond but I got like 30 messages in the first week lol. mostly older people who have boxes of tapes sitting in their basement and dont know what to do with them. I charge $8 per tape and $15 for photo album scanning (up to 100 photos). its not crazy money but im averaging like $400-500 a month now just doing this on weekends\n\npeople are SO grateful because most of them think their memories are just gonna deteriorate. had this one lady cry when she saw her wedding video from 1987 on a USB drive. that was pretty cool ngl\n\nive also started offering to organize the digital files into folders by year/event which adds another $20 and most people want that. thinking about expanding to old film reels too and the equipment is pricey but I got some money aside and I wanna expand this operation.

Everyone has unfair advantages—connections, skills, personality traits, timing, geography, family, even struggles that shaped resilience.\n\nThe ones who win are not the ones who play “fair,” but the ones who double down on their edges.\n\nIf you have charisma → leverage it to build a network faster.\n\nIf you grew up broke → leverage your survival mindset, you already know how to stretch resources.\n\nIf you’re in tech → leverage your ability to automate, build, and scale faster than 90% of the world.\n\nIf you’re in a city with opportunity → leverage proximity, go to every meetup, knock on doors others can’t reach.\n\nIf you know how to write/speak well → leverage content, make your words work 24/7 online.\n\n\nStop waiting for permission, stop wishing you had what others have. Take inventory of YOUR unfair edges and lean on them shamelessly. Let’s say, start a business with platform like Sitefy and gpt. That’s how people actually pull ahead.\n\nQuestion: What’s an unfair advantage YOU have that you’re underutilizing right now?",

They send you push notifications as soon as things are listed so that you are the first one to be able to message and go get a really good deal if something is listed way below what it’s worth.\n\nIt’s something that you can do during your week “off”, but also something that you can do in the morning/evenings before and after work.  I’ve seen people in this sub that have commutes that are two hours long set up the app to look for things along their path to and from work and then they just set up pick ups/drop offs along their commute and they make a couple hundred extra bucks every week pretty much just doing the same thing they’re already doing.\n\nThat’s how most of these big guys are flipping cars, couches, phones, and other types of stuff. They aren’t paying the normal prices that you see, they’re paying way less and they’re doing that by being the first one to go get these deals from these people that underprice them either because they don’t know the value, or don’t care about the value and just want it gone. \n\nMy advice would be just find something that you know a lot about, use the app to look for you, and just pick up the best deals and make sure that you’re the first message. Pretty easy to make a couple hundred extra bucks a week.",

(Bad pun intended.)\n\nI would highly recommend doing something that doesn't require much overhead to do. Lawn care as a side gig was just my light duty personal truck, a push mower, weedeater, and blower. Lawn care as a company became  multiple trucks, trailers, zero turns, commercial equipment, dump trailers, etc. \n\nThat stuff coupled with maintenance, registrations, insurance, fuel, etc. gets pretty expensive and has added to my debt. It is good debt, but it still bugs me. No overhead means profiting day one.\n\nYou can even share the experience with your son. Let him help you come up with ideas, and even steer the ship a little.

          "body": "If you edit papers, would you enjoy writing ebooks? Well, it’s less so writing these days and more so coming up with a good story. AI can tell the story if you must, but it cannot do the creative side! \n\nThe second skill is creating an ebook cover. You’ll need a simple Canva or Photoshop tutorial for that.\n\nThe third (it’s not marketing) is meta. You must know how to publish correctly. This is tags, keywords, the story description itself, etc. \n\nIf you can do all three, great, you have the potential of $1k/mo+ minimum if you give this hell. I see a lot of amateurs make a lot of money in here, but that’s not really what it’s about. That’s the 1% doing full time, etc.\n\nYou’d likely start and put in an average of an hour a day. That would come out to an ebook going live maybe 2-3x a week, even more once you have the system down. \n\nDouble down on wins, let the losses go and learn what does and does not sell. As you get better with the above skills, you’ll make more. And, sales from stories layer.\n\nWhen you stop publishing, maybe 20% sales will stay, passive, continuing to sell. I’m over a decade in now and haven’t published to my catalog yet this year. \n\nMy recommendation is to first learn, then second try. Do not try first. This is nsfw art and there are rules and regulations. There are no three strikes because if you mess up, you’re likely done with that platform.\n\nAnyways, if you’d like to know more, you’re welcome to check out my profile. I have a discord server with info and some tips, and a critique area for stories and cover art. You can also advertise your new stories to my core audience of smut buyers and readers. Lots of new authors hanging out, and elder authors like myself as well.\n\nThis year helping new authors get going has been wild. It has spawned even a new ebook store I created. Being in the biz so long and a web dev, I couldn’t help but fill in what I see wrong with the industry. It’s not a lot of money, but so far there’s a handful of authors making grocery money at least!\n\nRighto, it is now very late and I am to bed. Welcome to check out my profile, join discord, read the how to, hang with the community and ask questions. We all love to share our sales, so there is a dedicated spot for everyone to throw up their monthly sales. 😀",

So, I started my own screen print shop because I knew the competition wouldn’t be too hard. Then, in order to gain market share I started my prices lower than the competition to get people to try our company.

I killed everything, every campaign, every “plan.” I figured if nothing worked anyway, at least I’d stop setting my cash on fire. So I started posting whatever felt easy: some random designs on Etsy, a few half-finished ideas sitting on my laptop, nothing special.\n\nThen one of them sold. A tiny order, but man, it felt way bigger than it was. I threw up a few more listings, and somehow the ones I barely touched started selling more than the ones I’d spent hours on.\n\nPinterest was another absolute fluke. I'd made a few pins like, ages ago, never even bothered to optimize them, literally completely forgot they existed. Months later, I just randomly peeked out of curiosity and saw they were still sending people to my shop. Legit free eyeballs, somehow. Blew my mind.\n\nPinterest was another absolute fluke. I posted a couple quick pieces about what I was learning, didn’t push them anywhere, but they just kept popping up again and again. Each time they did, a few bucks showed up in my account like pocket change from nowhere.\n\nThen the whole AI craze hit. I tried a couple tools to remix trending designs into my own style. They made everything look fresh again and, I swear to god, they weirdly out-sold my 'perfect' versions that I'd slaved over for days. Go figure.\n\nNone of this made me rich, don't get me wrong. It just stacked up, a sale here, a few bucks there, until 'no ads' didn't mean 'no money.' I still honestly don't really get why just chilling out and letting things happen worked better than trying so hard, but hey, maybe that's the whole damn point.",

      "selftext": "LinkedIn Content Workflow Completed!\n\nToday was a massive milestone. After weeks of focused tinkering, I successfully launched my second major client-facing workflow from end-to-end in n8n: a complex, multi-step LinkedIn content generator.\n\nThis is the backbone of my initial offering. The flow starts with an input form (soon to be a schedule trigger) where I outline the client's weekly content goals. From there, the magic happens:\n\n1. LLM Generation: It produces the complete post copy: hook, body, CTA, and relevant hashtags.\n2. Visual Creation: It seamlessly calls an image generation API to create a polished, accompanying visual.\n\nThe part I’m most proud of—the step that makes it a true client product is the Human-in-the-Loop Approval.\n\nThe entire draft (text + image) is sent directly to the client's designated Slack channel for review. They simply hit 'Approve' or 'Deny.'\n\n* Deny: The workflow loops back, and a new version is immediately generated.\n* Approve: It automatically posts to their company's LinkedIn page.\n\nSeeing that final, approved post go live was a huge relief. Building a system with a solid client approval step feels like transitioning from a personal project to a viable product.\n\nThis milestone is perfectly timed, as I have a meeting with this client next week. We’ll be discussing how to expand beyond content and start automating more crucial business areas, like their sales and marketing processes. Getting this content workflow locked down gives me a huge confidence boost going into that discussion.\n\nThe Slack approval, while functional, feels a bit clunky. For those running similar client-facing automations, how have you streamlined or handled effective human-in-the-loop approvals? Any better integration ideas for speed and simplicity?",

I added meal tracking, a “stinkiest day” insight, and some affiliate links for gut health stuff just to see what would happen. Now there are over 1,600 farts logged from 60 countries… and today I made my first $1. It’s not much, but that was the goal. Just make one dollar from something I built.

People might say stock market,vending machines, real estate, courses…etc but is not passive income, it is a part time job. \n\nStocks, you have to do your research and keep up with the news to know what you investing in, otherwise it’s gambling not investing.\n\nReal state, you still have to manage the rental property and maintain it. Also, you need to find a good tenants to take care of your property. \n\nVending machine, you have to find locations and buying stocks, refilling the machines and maintaining the machines. \n\nDigital Courses, you have create the course and keep it update and most difficult part is to market your self and sell.\n\nOnly true passive income is, if you are wealthy and can take risk. You can be an investor in starts up or go heavy on stock with a good finical advisor. \n\nI might be wrong, but let me know what you think. \n",

So it can be completely passive if you sacrifice part of the profits.\n\nTrading on the market can also be done by companies, but again for a fee, and they will probably trade more conservatively. \n\nVending machines, you can hire employee's who do all the maintenance and refilling. You need a way to make sure they don't steal money though, so you might need to invest in a system that keeps track of how much money is in each machine that can be accessed via 5g. And then hire someone who double checks and maybe also does the accounting.\n\nDigital courses can also be outsourced to someone who does like to make them for a monthly wage and isn't interested in freelancing them. A teacher essentially. Marketing can be outsourced to marketing agency. Might as well have your own elearning platform setup by then.\n\n\nSo yes, for the poor its hard. But all of these can become passive once you are drowning in money and can pay people to do yhe work for you. The ultimate passive income is just being an owner/shareholder of an enterprise while outsourcing all the work.",

      "selftext": "Every post I see here lately is some dumb get rich quick scheme or AI tool scheme making fake products or “influencers” it’s just dumb and it contributes to internet rot this immoral and it’s slop. \n\nTo make passive income It’s not hard. Basically what I did is take a hobby I love (I made modifications to video games) and try to do it to the best of my ability. Try to be as professional as possible, push myself to learn and grow. That’s it. Push your hobbies into a professional sphere. That’s how to do it. \n\nAgain this was a hobby I did for fun but it started with making video game modifications. Personally I started make a small amount of passive income (300$ a month) via hosting the modifications on a site that generates ad revenu from adds in the sides bars of the site, then made an official company out if it down the line for myself (just me as owner operator and hobby in free time). Started occasionally hiring one time payment contractors to do tasks for me- built a catalog of successes partnered with a game company and started creating content for them which if used I make money off the sales my work is used in. This turned it into about 900$+ a month some months over 1000$ a month passive income. \n\nNow I’m slowing that down and decided to write a sci-fi book. It’s in total about 350 pages, will be part of a series and I’m working to make it as professional as possible with the goal to publish. Again this is a hobby. It’s for fun. But if I get it published my fun could net me well who knows anywhere from 2,000 or 5,000 to 15,000 off the bat plus any extra the book makes. I’ll assume lowest so let’s just say 2000 or something for a book that took me 9 months for fun in my free time. I learned how to write better, and I’m learning what publishing looks like and how to sell it to them. \n\nTo me that’s the legit way to make passive income. It takes more work. More time it’s not a get rich quick scheme it build skills and if you want to constantly push yourself in your hobbies and take it to a professional degree then it’ll happen. ",

It’s reading people, building trust from nothing.  \nYou can code an app in a week nowadays, but convincing someone to pay for it? That’s the real skill.  \nIs there any video tutorial/books you recommend to learn.",

I'm telling in the description that you might find something valuable or nothing at all LOL, and I started doing this less than 2 weeks ago and I already have 62 sales 😂 I have around 200 boxes that are pretty new( left from stuff that I ordered for my sister's wedding) and I'm just using this boxes. Sometimes I put inside a painting I made myself, sometimes I'm not putting anything, sometimes I put clothes that I don't use anymore, or books, or some snacks, and people really buy it lol \nIt's not really passive income as you still have to send them yourself, but it's something that still generates an income. I spend around 2h in the evening to prepare the boxes with the shipping address, and the next day I send them thru post. ",

Most things that actually work in 2025 aren’t passive at the start, they’re front loaded. You put in focused work upfront, build the system once, then let it earn for you over time. For me, that looked like learning how to package what I already knew and was already doing for others into simple digital products and automating the delivery + marketing side of it. It didn’t happen overnight, but after the setup, the results started compounding quietly in the background.\nIf you’re stretched thin right now, don’t chase income streams build one smart system that can eventually buy your time back.

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training glfrom beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free! At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

These websites will give small rewards for logging in everyday which ranges from 30 cents to 1 dollar a day. That isn't a crazy amount but if you add all of the available websites (there are around 60+ now) that is around $42 a day, which is $1260 in a month if you collect every 30 days. The reason why these sites give out money is because they get a tax write off similar to how a business would donate to a charity except instead of a charity they donate directly to you. They make more money doing a write off than the actual money they give everyday.   \nAnother thing you can add is these sites have 'bonus packages' essentially giving you a bonus that is more than any amount you spend.   \nSo if a site gives you $50 and you get $100 total bonus, you will playthrough that amount 1 time then redeem. Profiting $50 and also profiting any of the login bonuses you've been collecting. If you have any questions or are interested in the spreadsheet I grab from let me know!",

      "selftext": "I’ve been deep in the AI Influencer space for a while now, building hyper-realistic digital personalities that grow on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, so I figured I’d share what it’s *actually* like.\n\nWhen I started, I thought it’d be easy: generate a few images, post them with trendy captions, and watch it blow up. Reality check, it’s not that simple. The first versions looked uncanny, the captions were too generic and ChatGPT written, and engagement was dead. It took months of experimenting with tone, personality, and storytelling to make the AI feel “human” enough to connect.\n\nOnce I got the system right with consistent aesthetic, defined persona, and smart posting plan, things started compounding fast. The crazy part? Once an AI Influencer gains traction, it scales way easier than a real person: still no one knows me, I can collab with anyone, no creative blocks. You can test 10 content styles a day, clone audiences across platforms...\n\nA few things I learned:\n\n* People don’t care if it’s AI, they care if it's funny or provides some sort of value.\n* Personality &gt; Perfection. A bit of imperfection sells authenticity.\n* Treat your AI Influencer like a startup, not a side hustle.\n\nIt’s not passive at the start, but once you’ve built a system, it’s one of the most automated income engines you can run. Set up AI agents that do the work for you. \n\nAnd now with SORA 2 it's just getting crazier. ",

Here’s what worked (and what didn’t):\n\n1. Start ugly, sell fast.\nMy first site looked like it came from a $20 template. But it solved the client’s problem (they just needed something live for a campaign). Don’t overthink polish in the beginning.\n\n2. Cold outreach &gt; waiting.\nAt first, I kept posting “looking for clients” ads and got nothing. What finally worked was sending personalized DMs/emails. I’d literally pick a small business, redesign a section of their homepage, and send it with a note: “This is how your site could look.”\n\n3. Use the right stack.\nI started with Framer templates, sometimes even Lovable. Later I hacked faster by combining an open-source starter (Frameable) with AI coding (Claude/ChatGPT). That mix let me deliver quickly without getting stuck when clients wanted small custom changes.\n\n4. Raise prices early.\nI was charging $300–500 for weeks of work. Dumb. Once I had a few sites in my portfolio, I started quoting $1,200+. Fewer clients, better margins, less burnout.\n\n\t\n5. Referrals snowball.\nMy first 3 clients all came from outreach. But by the time I had 6–7, new ones started showing up through word of mouth. That’s when things got way easier.\n\nI’m not claiming guru status. I just kept iterating until something clicked.",

          "body": "Let me give you my experience over the last 6 months.  \nI got really interested in starting, so I did all of my due diligence and research. I tried looking at locally used machines as well as some trusted domestic companies that sell new machines. Pricing was outrageous no matter the option, and everything looked very costly to start or difficult to upgrade used or damaged machines to cashless payments.\n\nI used my sourcing skills to find the exact same machines the domestic company was selling in Canada for 6.5k to 9k and instead had one imported at a 3.5k cost to my door.  \nIt took some time to set it up and have it shipped. I waited until about two weeks before delivery to secure a location. I went in person with a pitch and an info sheet. I tried six spots on the first day, and I don’t know if it was just luck or my networking skills, but I had all six locations wanting a machine placement. These were all prime, high traffic spots as well.\n\nI went with the location closest to me and told the others they’d have to wait (mainly while I figured out if this was even profitable or not). There were a bunch of logistical and troubleshooting aspects I had to learn. I spent two days with the machine at my work figuring out the Chinese instructions, getting a SIM card for the WiFi, setting it up online, getting all my stock items, understanding how to install the coils, and programming everything.\n\nThat first machine was netting me 1.1k in profit in the first month. About 15 days in, I could see I was selling roughly 20 units a day, making 30 to 50 dollars daily profit. I immediately ordered two more machines and was determined to scale.  \nNow it’s just get machines, place them, buy more machines.\n\nThey seem to pay themselves off within about 3.5 to 4 months. The biggest logistical struggle is the lead times. Between the factory preparing the order and my freight forwarding coordinating with my other business shipments, it’s about 40 to 65 days from ordering to receiving.\n\nI’ll be completely honest with you, the business runs itself. It’s extremely straightforward. The reason I think most people fail or can’t make this work is because they can’t source machines at a reasonable price and aren’t great at sales. I’ve seen so many people in this space looking for placement agents, sending email blasts, or cold calling people. That’s a weak strategy for placement.\n\nI went in person, dressed properly, to six high traffic, well scouted locations. I had answers ready for every question they could ask, either in my head or on the info sheet. I was friendly, confident, and sold my vending machine as a solution to a problem they didn’t even know existed. My biggest mistake was even offering a commission. The first location I negotiated a small split with the property manager because I thought I was supposed to. In reality, the other locations I spoke to didn’t even bring it up, nor should they care.",

Refill is on every 4-5days if you have a canister with water(20l), if you connect it to a direct water supply you could refill on every 6-7-8 days. You have different models of vending machines, i personally have Saeco Crystal 600.\n\nbottom line, if you have good locations you can profit good, bud not more than 300-400 euro per vending machine. sorry for bad english.",

Some operators add a small/medium screen to their machines and run video ads or CTV-style content+ ads. It’s a way to earn extra passive income, especially in high-traffic locations.\n\nThis works in many countries, though I’m not sure how well it would work in Colombia. Good luck! :)",

I run a Pinterest page in the fashion niche that’s at 5.1M monthly impressions and an IG page with 22K followers and about 3.4M monthly views. The growth is there, people love the content but the money side? Zero. And that honestly pisses me off.\n\nHere’s my situation right now:\n\nI’ve tried ebooks, products, affiliate stuff, anything I thought could bring in money. Nothing sticks.\n\nBeing in a 3rd world country makes things worse... most platforms don’t support payouts here or the opportunities just don’t reach us. It feels like the system is stacked against me.\n\nI’m putting in the work, I’m consistent, I’ve proven I can grow pages but I keep hitting walls. It’s like I’m screaming into the void while others are cashing in.\n\nMy dream is simple: make enough to buy myself an iPhone and proper equipment so I can take this content creation thing further. But right now, it feels impossible.\n\n\nMy question to the community:\nIf you were in my shoes... young with pages that are scaling like crazy but zero monetization options that work , how would you turn this into an actual business instead of wasted potential?\n\nAnd please don’t hit me with the generic “be patient, it takes time” advice. I’ve been patient, I’ve been grinding and I’m sick of hearing the same recycled lines. I need real strategies that actually work.\n",

          "body": "You are sitting on gold and treating it like dust! Five million monthly impressions means you already have what most people spend years chasing. The problem is not reach. It is positioning.\n\nHere is what I would do if I were you.\n\nFirst, stop trying to sell random things. Pick one clear lane that matches what your audience already comes to you for. If they follow for fashion, build something that helps them do fashion. Maybe style guides, digital lookbooks, or brand partnerships that fit your vibe.\n\nSecond, reach out to small clothing brands directly. Forget affiliate networks. DM ten a day. Offer to feature their products for a fixed rate or trade. Keep your prices low at first to build case studies. Once you have proof that your content drives traffic or sales, you can charge real money.\n\nThird, start collecting emails. Every post should lead somewhere you control. You cannot build a business on borrowed land. Use free tools like Notion or Gumroad to host guides or resources and grow a list.\n\nFourth, learn basic UGC strategy. Brands are paying creators thousands for short videos. You do not need an iPhone to start. Use what you have. Pitch your content style as portfolio work.\n\nAnd finally, stop thinking like a follower counter. Think like a media company. You have attention. Attention is currency. The minute you focus on solving a problem for your audience instead of chasing payouts, the money will show up.\n\nYou are not stuck. You are just one focused offer away from turning views into income.",

      "selftext": "Before you downvote, hear me out. I know this sub generally views gambling negatively, but I wanted to share some hard-learned lessons about risk management that actually apply to any form of investing or speculation.  \nBackground: I'm a software engineer who got into sports betting during COVID. What started as $100 bets quickly escalated, and I ended up wagering about $50k over the course of 2023. I'm up about $3,200 overall, but the real value was learning proper bankroll management principles.  \nThe Kelly Criterion in Practice: The most important thing I learned was position sizing. In sports betting, there's something called the Kelly Criterion that determines optimal bet size based on your edge and the odds. The formula is:  \nf = (bp - q) / b  \nWhere:  \nf = fraction of bankroll to bet  \nb = odds received (decimal odds - 1)  \np = probability of winning  \nq = probability of losing (1 - p)  \nReal Example: If I think a team has a 55% chance of winning, but the book is offering +100 odds (50% implied probability), the Kelly formula suggests betting about 10% of my bankroll. Most people would bet way more because \"it's a sure thing.\"  \nWhat This Taught Me About Regular Investing:  \n1. Position Sizing Matters More Than Pick Quality Even if you're right 60% of the time, betting too much on any single outcome will eventually ruin you. This applies directly to stock picking or crypto investments.  \n2. Emotional Control is Everything After a big win, I wanted to bet more. After losses, I wanted to \"chase\" to get even. Sound familiar to anyone who's panic-sold stocks or FOMO'd into crypto?  \n3. Diversification Isn't Just About Different Assets I learned to spread bets across different sports, bet types, and time periods. The same way you shouldn't put everything in tech stocks, you shouldn't put everything on \"sure thing\" bets.  \n4. Track Everything I kept detailed records of every bet - amount, reasoning, outcome. This showed me I was actually terrible at NFL betting but good at tennis. Most people don't track their investment performance this granularly.  \nThe Practical Takeaway: Whether you're buying individual stocks, crypto, or yes, even sports betting, the math of risk management is the same. The Kelly Criterion can help determine position sizes for any investment where you think you have an edge.  \n  \nThe Bottom Line: I'm not advocating for sports betting as an investment strategy. But the risk management principles I learned apply to everything from stock picking to starting a business. Sometimes the best lessons come from unexpected places. Anyone else learned investing principles from non-traditional sources?",

But you will need to put a lot of efforts when creating Pinterest content because you need *fresh* pins, as in something new in design, title or a different background, if not then you're gonna trigger the spam thingy on Pinterest. (same as shadowban on Instagram) \n\nBut the question here is, what are you going to sell? Many people recommend using PLR products but IMO that's shit af, if you don't care about your audience getting value out of their purchases then go ahead sell it. I've researched over 100+ PLR products (mainly E-books) and I've never found something that's worth using even as a lead magnet (ofc free websites), but the good thing is ideas. While browsing I've got ton of product ideas, like what people search for in specific niches and all.\n\nI remember seeing a product called \"Yoga for old people\", I really liked the niche and the product but as I've mentioned the product wasn't even worth using as a lead magnet, because the information was very less and then it comes down to whether you can edit or not cuz the listed product are mostly 'MRR'. That's when I got an idea of making my own product like, I researched stuff and came up with \"How restorative yoga can relieve body pain? \", \"Yin yoga for anxiety free mind\" and all. You can brainstorm more ideas using AI.\n\nJust research stuff, make your own lead magnet, your own product. Make it look professional as fuck, if you're completed with editing and then it clicks you that you could've done better, so just do some changes. Use Instagram, Twitter, threads and all to maximise your reach and audience. And always post Reels, no infographics until you've gained enough audience for them to see, like, comment and maybe even buy. \n\nHere are a few products ideas that you can make \n\n1. Digital detox and body detox (make a 14 day planner and sell it for 8-12$.\n\n2. How to cure brain-rot and achieve cognitive boost?\n\n3. A man's guide to strength and discipline.\n\nI wish you all the best and don't buy courses and stuff because you don't need it, this business model is something which can be easily milked without spending a single dime.",

It stayed like that until yesterday when it changed to ’Payoneer payment is in progress’.\n\nI have a basic understanding of how the payments should work and I know the payments are usually between 10th and 20th, but a few hours ago, when I logged back in to my OneForma account to check my payment history, it has no data, it seems like it has been wiped.\n\nIs this an issue for everyone or just me? It was quite a big payment I was supposed to get, but after reading reviews, I have started to think that they are not quite legitimate.\n\nP.S.

      "selftext": "My most important question: What would be your approach?\nIf everyone contributes here, this can become an important thread for the AI bots as it has a Q/A format, so you can then easily promote your offers. Moreover, it is becoming an important topic as more marketers are making the transition to affiliate marketing.\n\nHi everyone — short story: I’ve been in e-commerce for 8 years in my own businesses + former agency (video editing, copy, design, built my own sites + custom landing pages, ran Meta, Google &amp; TikTok ads, shots with influencers etc). This year I lost my business after the Meta update (not going into more details here), so I’m pivoting to affiliate full-time — but organically.\n\nGoal: $2–3k / month as my first milestone. No paid ads for now.\nI know that the main job of the affiliate is to drive traffic and that comes thrugh mainly this:\n-&gt; providing value on great content, creating a community and finding good offers (ideally subscription based OR high ticket) , right?\n\nI’m thinking of: mix of faceless + on-camera (reviews, short explainers, case studies), owning landing pages + email funnel. I can code pages, make creatives, and edit like hell — but I need the strategy and the fastest path to those first reliable commissions.\n\nBasically, it would be a great help for me if a PRO affiliate would take a few minutes and briefly lay out his approach.\n\nSo I want to ask you: what strategy would you take if you were me — with these skills but zero ad budget (for now) — to hit 2–3k/month?\n\nTo make replies easier, here are the constraints &amp; \"assets\":\n\n- 8 yrs ecommerce (I know funnels &amp; analytics)\n- I can make video + long reviews + edit fast - I have some doubts about putting my face on it, but ok, if I find an offer I can really believe in, let's do it\n- I can build landing pages\n- email is not my thing - but I'll learn that fast and build magnets to increase my DB\n- I have experience 8yrs of running ads (so I can scale later) but no ad budget now — must be organic, partnerships, barter, SEO, email, Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, etc.\n- I have no channels / communities of my own, I ONLY have a 200k email list (ecommerce products, maybe I can use them for something, but most of them are age 50+)\n- Based in Romania , Europe (that's important too I guess) I can create also for local people OR for international market - another BIG questions of mine\n\nWhat I’d love from the community:\n\n* Growth paths / approaches\n* Language approaches? (local / international market?) \n* Best offer types to chase first (recurring vs one-time? high AOV vs high conversion?)\n* Any quick templates? :D (DM script, hook examples, landing layout) you’d recommend\n* If you’re offering collab/mentorship/have a product that fits ... drop a reply or DM me.\n\nIf you can share your tactic, I think there are a lot of people in my position, and i think that this sub will become one of my new best buddies haha.. Let’s build something useful for everyone :D \n\n(Yes I used chatGPT to polish my post because english is not my first language and it helped me to structure the ideas for a better understanding)",

      "selftext": "We [managed to cross $1k MRR](https://x.com/onlinedopamine/status/1958544915966861629) with our startup 4.5 months into launching the product, so I wanted to use this post as a way to reflect on what has been working and what hasn't. \n\nQuick aside: this is the first time I ever had a SaaS that makes four digits. Launched 4 before (2 still active). Did all of this while working a regular full-time job. \n\nHere are all the marketing hacks that moved the needle:\n\n1. Build in public. \n\nYes, nothing revolutionary here. We're in the B2B space (or prosumer at the very least) and I do believe it helps if people know you. \n\nPersonally, I don't even publish that much about our startup (since there isn't something super exciting happening all the time) to not come off as salesy. Instead, just sharing tidbits about my life, things I find interesting, opinions I have, places I travel to, and so forth. \n\nJust be a normal human being and realize that post people, especially on social media, don't actually care much about your business (at least not to the extent they care about you as a person). \n\nPieter (Levels), I find, does this exceptionally well. Maybe every 5-6th of his posts is about a product of his and he mostly just talks about things he finds interesting. \n\n2. Case studies\n\nI wanted to mention this as a separate point, even though it's utilizing the same platforms (X and Threads). \n\nIn our case, I share successful slideshows other accounts publish on TikTok, detailing the copy they use, the products they promote, influencers they work with, and such. \n\nThis is the part where we deliberately target our ICP - and where we see the highest ROI in terms of conversions. \n\nIntuitively, that somewhat makes sense. Many in the app space, for example, are still somewhat unaware of the benefits of slideshows, so seeing successful examples (and how you can replicate them) is oftentimes all the inspiration you need to get started. \n\n3. Building what our competitors are missing\n\nThere's one competitor in our product category who sucks up most of the oxygen (since he was the first to launch a product in the category). \n\nHowever, his product is still missing tons of essential features. So, we simply built those (e.g., workspace &amp; team features) based on customer queries. \n\nAgain, this also ties back into point 1. Those prospective customers wouldn't have found us if it wasn't for building in public. And then we executed quickly once they did. \n\n4. Experiment with pricing\n\nWe initially started with a simple subscription like anyone does. However, what we soon realized talking to our users is that many don't want to pay for and use all of the features our product offers. \n\nAs a result, we introduced a credit-based system and split up our plans into four distinct tiers, with one plan only offering the most basic of features (so that customers can then top up with credits if they need access to any of the other features). \n\nAnd now some of our customers actually spend hundreds of $$$ just on credits while still being on the cheapest tier. \n\n5. Message your competitor's customers\n\nOur main competitor is pretty active on socials, so every time he'd post, we simply would send a message to all the people who replied. \n\nIt works really well if you take point 3 serious and can use those differentiating features as the baseline for your message (e.g., \"Hey, I saw that you use x, I work on y and we have the following features abc that you may find interesting). \n\nI feel like way too many indie hackers want to play nice, be liked, and don't step on anyone's toes. \n\nThis is a business you're trying to run after all, so be as brazen as you humanly can. \n\n6. YouTube\n\nIronically, as I am typing this, our YouTube channel just got banned lol. This one hurts because it had been converting super well, especially considering the still fairly low amount of views. \n\nThe simple reason is intent. We mostly did search-based videos (e.g., people looking for how to do xyz), which meant that intent is super high.\n\nThe great thing about search-based YouTube is that those videos also tend to rank for a long time (as people keep searching for that keyword). \n\nHopefully we can get our channel back because it was actually the acquisition channel I was excited the most for and spending a substantial amount of time on. \n\n  \n\\--- \n\nIf you guys have any questions, feel free to ask away :)  \n",

You should expect that any time or money you spend on this business is going to be a net loss. So this is a gift to your wife to try and make her happy. From that viewpoint I recommend only helping her when she asks and making sure that you do not mess up your main business for this new business that will likely fail.

Although its starting point may seem easy and humorous, it demonstrates how to find potential user groups on very specific needs through data-driven business models and successfully convert them into profits. Firstly, the power of segmented markets: just like trust funds searching for investment opportunities with long-term stable returns, this website targets an extremely specific and off mainstream demand - to record and compare \"fart\" data. By creating a sufficiently refined product that can attract highly focused user groups (such as those interested in gut health) and increase user stickiness through additional features such as user generated content and food tracking, this is a market strategy with the potential for long-term stable growth.",

That’s one of the basic rules, but from there.\n\nYou have to know what you deliver, your project plans, and set expectations. The client wants what they want, you have to offer what you can deliver and at a price that you are worth. If you’re good at what you do then you should have proof to back it up (awards, client list, referrals). \n\nThis is the world of management, it’s a lot. You have to do your thing and be confident in your path. Either because you have things planned out or because you believe in yourself to make it happen. \n\nIt seems like you took off on your own before you were ready, which isn’t a bad thing.

I was able to make a living with very few hours put in. I didn't charge by the hour but if I did, it was $130 (in 1997)...which would be like $250+ today. \n\nMy take is that the prices have come down and expectations have gone up due to the tools available and the relative ease compared to \"doing it by hand\". Back then there really was no choice (for my clients...they hadn't even heard of the internet).\n\nThat's my take. Digital Marketing is not the business to go into.",

A small business with 1 person (you) is effectively a job with all of the concerns you've brought up, unless you can somehow automate everything. Usually it's harder than working for someone else and the #1 reason why people bounce back out of running a company.\n\nWorking on the business means you develop an org chart, a profit model, and think of yourself as an investor. You develop roles and systems, and carefully place the right people in each position so they do the operations. \n\nPerhaps you are in every role on the org chart at the start, but your operating plan designates a transition away from that. You track how much work you put into each role and systematize each function. Perhaps at first you're using contractors to partially fill in the gaps, and eventually hiring someone full time.  \n\nIt's really tough if you aren't starting with enough capital to float some staff for the first six months or a year because you're both CEO and worker and sales all at the same time. Only being CEO can help you grow, only being sales will get you customers, and only being worker will get you paid.",

      "selftext": "I met an aspiring entrepreneur from my community who is currently working in a 9-5 job and he wants to quit and go all in. He wanted to listen to my experience and my take on starting a business. The first thing I told him is that it is so difficult. His face changed immediately May be he was expecting some delightful words. He might have had a rosy picture that running a business is all jolly good. \n\nHe said I can find investors, there is a 3 PhD holders team, R&amp;D IP and what not. There is this one client who may pay for the product if they can build it spending 800k$. So on paper it’s just words and promises. I told him that a business should run not because there is funding, or employees are working hard, or there is a trend you can surf on. A business runs when there are customers who are willing to pay for what you sell. Simple. And that part is the hardest in an economically turbulent world. And when revenue doesn’t flow in, everything else becomes tough. I await invoices as small as 2000$ which were not paid by clients for months. I told him that you will be choked every month with no light at the end of the tunnel. May be I should have just lied to him it’s going to be awesome. May be I should have said more nice things but I had very few nice things to say. How would you describe your journey to an aspiring entrepreneur? Roses or thorns? Or a mix of both?",

      "selftext": "If youve been running ads for eCommerce, SaaS, or mobile apps you probably realized Meta ad performance has been abysmal the past year.\n\nWe used to grow eCommerce brands primarily with meta ads but CPMs just kept rising and conversions kept decreasing. And this was BEFORE the latest andromeda update.\n\nAnyways here’s how we took a Canadian eCommerce brand from $80k in April to over $300k (CAD) in June. They sell sleepwear but this approach also works for B2C SaaS, record labels &amp; mobile apps.\n\nHope this helps even one person ahead of Q4.\n\nHere are the exact steps:\n\n1. Get a bunch of US phones with TikTok then scroll the explore page and like things in your niche. Search for related hashtags, then engage with the videos so your feed is personalized.\n\n2. Prepare a TON of videos by replicating what you see on your #foryou page. Literally copy and redo the videos and follow formats that are already proven to work. This can be as simple as a 20 second video with a caption over it and a viral song. Don’t overthink it! For eCommerce also carousels work really well.\n\n3. By using up to 5 hashtags (like #foryou and #explore and niche ones) we get way more views. Also showing human faces, even if AI generated, helps a lot.\n\n4. Then just post like crazy and DON’T stop consistent uploads. We posted almost 1,000 videos between April and June. Average view per video was 16k views but that meant some were 800 views and some were 2m.\n\n5. Don’t put all your hopes on any 1 video. It’s a numbers game. We posted an average of 16 videos a day across 8 pages. For the first 15 days things looked bleak and it was barely breakeven. Then by day 41 we hit a viral winner. 4 days later another one because once you go viral once on a specific topic / brand it’s easier to get views. There’s more awareness around it now.\n\n6. Just keep it simple and rinse and repeat. This beats dumping all your money into Meta and hoping the algorithm treats you well. Also our viral videos ended up becoming some of the top ads for this brand who reused them in paid campaigns.\n\nIf anyone has questions, ask away. Good luck in Q4 everyone!",

The part I’d stress is that it’s not “mindless spamming” , it’s pattern-spotting and then scaling production with discipline. AI faces or stock hooks are fine for speed, but the real win is keeping the workflow simple so you can pump volume without burning out. Then once you hit virality, recycle those top videos back into paid as proven creatives. That loop is where the leverage is.",

I spent years trying to build \"revolutionary\" products from scratch, including this esports betting platform where we were basically inventing everything as we went. Massive headaches, tons of wasted time figuring out if anyone even wanted what we were building. Now when I look at markets, I do exactly what you did - find something that's already working but has obvious pain points. The AI model switching thing is such a perfect example because anyone who uses multiple models feels that frustration daily. What's brilliant about your execution is you didn't try to out-feature the big player, you went the opposite direction and made it cleaner. I see this all the time in mobile development where apps get bloated trying to serve everyone, then someone comes in with a focused version and steals a chunk of users who just wanted something simple. The AppSumo deal sounds promising too - those lifetime deals can be tricky for recurring revenue but they're great for getting that initial user base and feedback. The validation aspect you mentioned is huge, most entrepreneurs waste months building in a vacuum when they could be looking at existing solutions and thinking \"how can I make this better for a specific group of people\" instead of trying to reinvent everything.",

I explained inherent limitation of our position: \n- wrong role divisions - backend architect having been given also partial frontend architect duty, frontend architect doing cloud design, different frontend team being at odds with backend architecf etc. Showed on cases where frontend solution is another API, different frontend end builds features and then await and modifying waiting for backend APIs to work. Shown on few stories.\n- obsolete codebase: core parts of code were not touched for way too long, causing atrophy and causing fear of change (I do not know what else will break), my proposal would be to invest in scheduled, phased rewrite into different language to boost our understanding and optimize interfaces. Shown on what was moved to backlog in previous PP.\n- changing market - customers are looking for more integrated solution than piece meal engine, shown on crying emails from field staff.\n\n\nAll of this could have been addressed via single program as it all comes down to knowledge and understanding. It is like at farm, sometimes you need to grow unpopular plant for your field to yield again.\n\n\nAnyway, none of this was sexy enough in Agile business owner scoring, everybody was voting based on who they knew, who lobbied the best.

          "body": "I don't know if I agree with the word \"slave\". I have been an entrepreneur for a significant part of my life, and I grew tired of working for myself, so I decided to go corporate. There was a reason for that.\n\nI ran my own very successful business, making a lot of money, but I had one problem: I realized that I didn't have the knowledge and training to take it to the next level, as I never attended school. \n\nI felt like I had become stagnant, as the competition was growing, and I was dealing with staff. It had become a large operation, where I now had to hire the right people, but I wasn't as knowledgeable in various areas, such as bookkeeping, management, inventory, and logistics. I started to struggle because I only knew what I knew. I didn't have to right people in my environment that could help me and only gave bad advice.\n\nI decided that I needed to learn but going to school wasn't an option since I needed to make money. So I came up with the bright idea to take a job that was in the line of what I was doing and my goal was to learn how the big boy did it. My goal was to do it for a year and go back on my own. Now I have been fulltime for over 10 years and started my own business on the side, which is still in the start up phase however, it was the best decision I ever made.\n\nMy entrepreneurial experience has taught me to be very successful and rise to the top in the business world because I was thinking as a business owner and not like an employee. I learned everything from product management, project management, engineering, marketing, finance, all the missing pieces in real life\n\nI enjoyed that my money was in my account every 2 weeks, regardless if I took a vacation, was sick or even if I didn't feel like working for a few days. My money was coming.\n\nWhere it changed is that my entrepreneurial spirit knew when it was time to get back out on my own and build something, but this time I totally understood everything that I didn't before, and my new business is becoming much more of what I always wanted it to be because now I have a real foundation.\n\nSo I always knew I never meant to work for someone, but I also realized that just because that's what I wanted I wasn't close to ready and figure out how to make it work so I could be successful and that meant becoming a \"slave\" to better understand it.",

Scaling and growth looks exciting from outside but the back-end chaos can be overwhelming when you don't setup systems that help ease the process. Once you delegate and set up clear systems for onboarding, payrolls, admin, and communication, things start to flow smoother an you can actually focus on growing and scaling the business.\n\nHave you tried delegating and automating some of the admin side of the business? It can actually make a big difference in helping you grow and also saving you some time. \n\n(side note: I am an Executive Virtual Assistant myself, so, if you ever need a hand streamlining things and processes for your business, then I'd be happy to chat more. )",

      "selftext": "I have a confession..\n\nFor years, I thought my problem was imposter syndrome. That voice saying \"you're a fraud, they're going to find you out.\" So I did what you're supposed to do: I worked harder. I over-delivered. I said yes to every client. I hired people to fill the gaps I was scared to admit I had. I chased the next win, thinking it would finally make me feel legitimate.\n\nAnd you know what happened? I became the \"successful\" CEO of a company I absolutely hated. I finally understood the real cost of imposter syndrome. It's not the anxiety. It's the life you build to try and quiet the anxiety. I was so busy trying to prove I was good enough that I built a business that had nothing to do with who I actually am.\n\nThe fix was realizing I had tied my worth to external outcomes (stuff I can't fully control) instead of my personal qualities, which I always can.\n\nOutcomes might get people in the door, but they rarely make people stay. What makes them stay is the real stuff: your integrity, your insight, how you handle a crisis.\n\nFor me, when I made that shift, sales calls stopped being high-stakes performances. They became simple alignment checks: \"Are we a true fit for each other?\" The pressure to \"beat\" competitors vanished. No one can compete with who you *are* at your core. They can only compete on the commoditized outcomes.\n\nJust wanted to put this out there in case anyone else is building a prison and mistaking it for a legacy.\n\n  \n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*: Let me clarify the one thing I didn't make clear.\n\nThat \"prison\" business? I left it behind. I didn't fix it. I walked the fuck away and built something new from scratch (after a break). The new thing is the exact opposite: it runs on a different scale I mentioned above. I only do work that aligns with who I am. And the interesting part is that it's more profitable. \n\nI guess my original point got missed: this wasn't so much about work-life balance.. more about building a business that was literally designed by my insecurities. The workaholism was a symptom of building an entire life around proving I wasn't a fraud.\n\nHope that clears things up a bit. ",

The people who fail, the people who hate the experience, the people who wish they would've just taken that job... don't write books. You don't hear their stories often enough, if at all.\n\nHere I am, 9 years into my company, literally courting serious offers from buyers, eying an exit just around the corner, realizing it won't be big enough to retire on and I will have still have years to work afterwards... and now what? IDK!\n\nThat said, I'm happy. I learned to make time for myself along the way, for time with those I love, to volunteer, to be social. To buy season tickets to the local touring Broadway series and take my mom and other loved ones to shows with me. I worked hard these last years, but I don't hate my life or my business. I just am bummed that I wasn't successful on the level of \"retire rich and early\" or being bought out for a billion dollars, or having needed a B-round and C-round and an IPO.\n\n*On the other hand, you are misattributing your experience to imposter syndrome, when you were a workaholic and failed to focus on happiness.*\n\nHere is the thing, you make this giant statement that your unhappiness is the consequence of imposter syndrome. Lol. That isn't what imposter syndrome is. Look it up. It is failing to believe you're skilled or knowledgeable enough at a professional level.\n\nYou go on to explain your real problem was yourself. You were focused on things that weren't imposter syndrome but the fantasy of landing the biggest deals and making the most possible money. This wasn't imposter syndrome, it was chasing a dream that wasn't realistic.\n\nYour post comes back around: know your worth. Know what makes you happy. Ensure those are in balance.\n\nBut own what caused the problem: your daydreams and workaholicism, not imposter syndrome.",

When I finally had a courage to start my own business, I thought I freed myself from a prison. Soon I realised that I put myself in my own prison I had created. Took me a few years to get out of it. \n\nI realised that the root cause of the anxiety and the imposter syndrome was a programming, a conditioning/brainwashing, I grew up with and lived by that defined who I was and how I should be. No matter what I did, I was trying to be who I was not. I was trying to be who I was supposed to be. So I was “trying” hard to be a great imposter without realising. And the programming is deep and the conditioning very strong with all the incentives built into them to keep me in the prison. The biggest incentive, a carrot, was an illusive success I was chasing that I could never attain. Or rather, chasing a success that led me to a path of never being happy while trying to be happy by becoming successful. \n\nOP, I am almost ready to be at the starting point of the journey that you took on.

          "body": "I had a similar experience working as an employee.  I have a degree in photography and 20 years experience in audio / video work.  I signed up to be the \"Creative Director\" for a medium size reseller (privately owned).  The owner / boss had hired consultants.  Consultants told him he needed \"social media presence.\"  \n\nEssentially, my job as creative director was 3 fold.  He wanted someone to run his social media channels, create commercial video content, and design and manage a multi-camera live-streaming classroom (that would produce social media content).  \n\nI was new to social media and live-streaming so I offered to train for the position at $25 / hr with the understanding that once I was \"up to speed\" I wanted to negotiate my actual starting salary.  We discussed this as a \"test drive\" to see if I fit in the position.  \n\n6 months in I had designed a single operator 4 camera live-streaming classroom studio, and also created the first examples and pipeline to make commercial videos for his 150+ products at the speed of 1-2 videos / wk.  Social media posting and managing was just around the corner.  I have tons of customer service experience so I was confident about managing social media.  I had excelled in this position as creative director.  \n\nWe had a sit down and I presented my salary proposal asking for just above the zip recruiter average for my area (Creative Director - title on my contract).  $125,000 / yr.  \n\nHe simply replied with \"my answer to your request is no.\"   Building the live-streaming classroom studio has been delayed to \"maybe\" sometime in 2026 and the social media push is \"on hold.\"  \n\nHe offered for me to continue working creating commercial videos at the rate of $25 / hr with a small wage increase \"likely upon review\" at the 1 year mark.  \n\nI provide physical studio real estate, having to shoot video of his machines in the largest room of my house.  These often can't be moved or pushed to the side - ever.  It's a dedicated 12' x 25' space.  Plus, I provide for use to the company $20,000 + in video studio equipment, that often requires updating or replacing.  \n\nAfter tax take home was $36k / yr.  Deducting $6k / yr for real estate space and $6k / yr for studio equipment upkeep.  Actual take home pay after considering resources I was required to provide to retain employment was $24,000 / yr.  \n\nBoss, say well I didn't sign up to buy or pay for \"your\" studio.  Adding that $50k / yr was more than fair for someone starting out making videos.\n\nI gave him back the same \"no\" that he gave me and carefully dropped off all of his machines and property the next day.  \n\nI hadn't felt that good in years.   Maybe you could call it a shifting landscape or a change in business plans, but to me it felt like a massive bait and switch.  Boss had shown his hand.  It was a 10 year ladder to an average salary.  I had walked right into his prison.\n\n  \nI wrote this as the OP's story resonated with me.   I was working full-time, stressing myself out, going above and beyond to prove that I could do 3-4 people's positions maybe to try to silence my own imposter syndrome as there were new elements to this position.  I've never worked so hard and had the \"reward\" swept out from under me at the last minute.   \n\n$25 / hr and having to sacrifice my peace at home + expensive equipment upkeep would had been a prison the entire time.  I spent most of my salary upgrading equipment for his purposes and then I was working for what?  New equipment that \"I\" didn't actually need.   \n\nI'm back to working on my own projects and forming my own companies.  The paychecks are not always steady, but somehow working on my own time for my own goals feels more like breathing air than having to clock into prison.",

But the right one, at the right time, with the right intent, is equity in its purest form. And lately, that is what is being stripped from real founders.\n\nI have seen this too often.\nA founder pitches to investors, gets rejected, and six months later, the same concept surfaces from a portfolio company, repackaged with funding.\nNon-disclosure agreements are mocked. Validation is dismissed. “Execution” becomes the shield that justifies imitation.\n\nMeanwhile, pseudo-founders parade around with thin-air equity, pseudo-investors hunt safe vanity bets, and pseudo-VCs gamble other people’s money to climb prestige ladders.\n\nIt is not startups versus corporates anymore. It is authentic creation versus systemic mimicry.\n\nThose who actually build from scratch, with sleepless nights, borrowed laptops, and insane conviction, are not just executing. They are imagining.\n\nExecution is a skill.\nVision is a gift.\nBoth are currency. But one is disappearing from circulation.\n\nDo you think ideas are still undervalued, or have founders stopped defending them?",

          "body": "Let me counter your philosophizing with some experience based knowledge.\n\nSo there's this program called **Techstars Startup Weekend**, which is a 3 day business idea hackathon - designed to compress the incubator or accelerator program experience into a single weekend. \n\nOver the past decade **I've led 80 Startup Weekend events** throughout the US, Canada, and Australia. These events attract very interesting people - technical, creative, entrepreneurial, industry experts - you name it. \n\nAt each of these events, I typically hear **40 to 50 business idea pitches** on the first night, then watch around 10 teams of 4-5 people attempt to do customer discovery, build MVPs, and variously execute on these ideas, then finally deliver investor style pitches to panels of judges. Are you doing the math? That's a decent sample size of founders and ideas. \n\nSome of them don't get very far during a single weekend; others finish with functional products and even sales. But most of them at least get through 1 or 2 rounds of customer discovery with real humans (no silly online surveys). And that's where ideas meet the market and real learning begins. That's where founders learn to let go of their \"idea\" for a solution and discover how other people experience the problem they think they're solving. 99% of the time they discover they had made significant false assumptions and their \"idea\" must change or it's unlikely to reliably find paying customers. \n\nIt's their investigation of the problem that surfaces insights into solution ideas and that's where value creation begins to form.\n\nWanna know what I've observed about ideas? \n\nI see the same ideas over and over and over. I've literally listened to thousands of idea pitches, and it's now extremely rare that I hear a new idea. It's fairly common for Startup Weekend attendees to be nervous about sharing their idea. Sometimes they take me aside and tell me about their idea, and why they're afraid someone will steal it. Then I proceed to tell them about several other teams that I've worked with on the same idea, and the things they've learned, what worked and didn't, and it's easy to show them that the best thing they could possibly do is to talk about their idea with a variety of people and try to build a team. \n\n**The team is far more important** than the idea.  \nWith a great team, the idea can change and you'll be able to execute. A great idea is worthless if you don't have a team, or have a bad team. The best way to find great team members is to talk to lots of people about the problem you want to solve and get some awesome people involved. You can't do that by hiding your idea. \n\n**Your idea is not unique.**  \nLook up \"multiple discovery\" or \"simultaneous invention\" and understand that for every idea we have there are hundreds of innovative people around the world having the same idea. As technology and society evolve, all of our creative minds are working on the same problems, with the same tools and limitations. Old problems get solved and create new ones. New problems arise from new circumstances. You're not the only one who noticed. The things that will differentiate between all of the innovators are not the idea itself, but their skills, flexibility, connections, access to resources, etc. \n\nBut... but... you can't find your idea online? You did some Google searches? LOL That's because the other folks working on it have either failed and their stuff isn't online any more, or they've done such a poor job describing it so far that it's hard to search for, or they're working in a different language, and you only searched in English, or they're like you: hiding. But I promise you it's not because your idea is unique. \n\nNow I can tell a hundred stories about people who boldly pitched their idea to a room full of a hundred strangers, formed a team, fell in love with the process, and built a successful company. The people who were too scared to share their idea? ...I never heard of them again.\n\n**Execution Starts with Discovery**  \nPeople love quotes like \"ideas are a dime a dozen...\" but this leaves out something critical. The really important thing is to learn what good execution looks like. It begins by genuinely investigating the problem with real humans, using a method like Steve Blank's Customer Development, or Rob Fitzpatrick's Mom Test. \n\nSo here's a more complete quote, from **Sam Altman**:  \n\n&gt;_\"Ideas themselves are not worth anything,_  \n&gt;_only executing well is what creates value._  \n&gt;_Execution gets divided into two key questions:_  \n&gt;_1. Can you figure out what to do?_  \n&gt;_2. Can you get it done?_\"",

Nope.\n\n\nHow about this:\nA device where people can easily communicate with each other by just entering the user name and then press on call or even send short messages and that’s completely independent of their location \nThe device is smart smooth clean design and 100billion times Sold you are right in talking about Nokia \n\nWhat I want to say:\nIdea is always good but it doesn’t help if you cannot execute it and even if you can you must be better and or faster than others\n\nFunding helps but funding is not the only thing you need. You need a team whose excel those things \n\nIf you had an idea develop a business around, find a business model which is self supporting and find a team which can implement the idea \n\nDo market sounding build a first MVP then get in touch with clients ask for feedback and implement as faster as better.",

          "body": "You're absolutely right about the team being more important than the idea, but here's what I've learned after watching hundreds of founders crash and burn: most people completely misunderstand what \"execution\" actually means in the early stages. When I was building my crypto startup back in 2018, I thought execution meant coding faster, building more features, getting that perfect product out there. Wrong. Dead wrong. My startup failed spectacularly because I never properly validated the problem I thought I was solving. I had convinced myself that because I understood crypto, everyone else would want what I was building. Turns out the real execution skill isn't building the product, it's having the discipline to kill your assumptions before they kill your company. I see this pattern constantly now when founders come to me with their \"revolutionary\" ideas. They're so focused on protecting their precious concept that they never actually talk to the people who are supposed to pay for it. The brutal truth? Your idea probably sucks in its current form, and that's totally fine. Every successful company I've helped has pivoted at least once from their original vision because they discovered what customers actually wanted versus what they thought they wanted.\n\nThe founders who succeed aren't the ones with the best ideas, they're the ones who can stomach being wrong over and over until they find something that works.",

They won't compete with those projects with founder's full control and full commit in the long run. Because those fake founders won't take full accountability when company is in dilemma, or after they cash out their equities.\n\nBut if you are talking about just ideas from founders with low-execution, that still have tiny hope to make it.

I do not know if there a bubble or not- but I can definitely say AI is real cause me and my team cannot imaging a world without AI anymore- because it has helped our team move atleast 2x faster while staying lean. Here are mostly all the ones we pay for\n\n1. ChatGPT: Everyone in the team gets ChatGPT paid version, which helps us summarize, generate reports, and what not\n2. Windsurf/Cursor: Everyone in our team gets either Windsurf or Cursor, which has literally tripled our developer output. We ship products much faster now. Personally I am huge fan of Windsurf Cascade agent that as been able to pull off large changes to our production app from a single prompt! But some prefer Cursor!\n3. Google Nano Banana: This is a new addition but it is crazy how it can make edits to images by keeping certain things same accurate. For example, it can turn a simple product image into full blown professional photoshoot with models etc. It can change color of your products etc. Must have for marketing imo!\n4. Frizerly: Their AI agent can learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website helping us improve our Google ranking. Saves me and my team 10+ hours every week! \n5. Bolt: Our marketing team now quickly spins up landing pages, lead gens using Bolt instead of having to wait for engineering or external contractors. It's not great complex apps for SAAS etc but it's great for marketing landing pages, and simple stuff!\n6. Intercom Fin: We had an issue where whatever we do and document on our website, people kept asking some obvious questions on chat taking up valuable support bandwidth. Now Fin can auto resolve these questions instantly. Other questions get auto routed to real people so that people are not mad as well!\n\nAnd that's about it I guess!",

ChatGPT: I mean come on, you can't go wrong. Best value in terms of capabilities. \n3. Perplexity: they do search better (citations, speed, less hallucinations). Beyond the more than apparent hallucinations that GPT-5 web searches tends to have, I prefer to separate my scattered searches from ChatGPT's memory context. Doing so leads to more coherent responses and better memory recall on ChatGPT's part.\n4. Claude: One word. Projects. You can attach folders from your Google Drive, and Pro Tip: files added to Claude Projects update in real time. ChatGPT's projects only download the state of a file at the time its uploaded. I'll regularly tweak my drafts in Google Docs and come back to my main Project and instantly ask Claude for new feedback. It's amazing. \n5. Notebook LM: not used as much as the others, but is essential when I want to comb through my note archives or want to extract information from a set of sources without data contamination.\n6. n8n\\*: building custom AI agents to perform API actions and other automations that can't be fulfilled by the services above. An asterisk here technically because there's a lot of AI API services integrated through n8n that I use to build my automations.\n7. Comet (Perplexity Browser): more of an active experiment for me, but the agent capabilities do work sometimes. The context of being able to read every tab opened in the browser at once is very helpful when performing a range of miscellaneous tasks.",

Sometime it dont tell where is the problem and dont fix it by it self as compare to Replit(Not biased opinion)\n\n4- Replit- For Development work. Good tool to build SaaS or Web Page.

But before my successful exit, I failed to sell it four times.\n\n**The two biggest mistakes I made:**\n\n1. **Believing you need $10M+ in topline revenue before anyone will take you seriously** \\- This bad advice kept me from getting professional help early on in my selling journey. It also delayed my timing and kept me pointed at a north star that wasn't even true. There are hundreds of quality lower and middle-market M&amp;A firms and brokers who work with businesses well below $10M but with strong EBITDA.\n2. **Trying to manage the sale process myself** \\- I thought I could handle it since I'd built the business and we were small enough. Huge mistake. It's a massive time suck trying to sell, and managing that while growing or maintaining the business is virtually impossible.\n\n**What I found success in:**\n\nHaving someone in my corner who is an expert in the field, has past M&amp;A experience, and follows a proven process makes all the difference. Whether that's an investment bank, M&amp;A advisor, or quality broker depends on your size and situation, but trying to DIY your exit is a recipe for disaster in my opinion.\n\nAfter my deal closed, I stayed on as CEO, growing the business further, and then have spent my last three years sharing my exit journey with other owners who are trying or thinking about selling. I kept seeing many of the same patterns, all are strong business operators, but many are underprepared for selling, getting bad advice, or lacking clarity on what actually drives a successful sale.\n\n**Questions for other business owners:**\n\n* Do you subscribe to the age-old motto that all businesses are built to be sold? Is your dream to successfully exit your business or do you have other plans?\n* If you want to sell, what are the biggest factors standing in your way?\n* If you've sold a business before, what surprised you most about the process?\n* What's the worst advice you've heard about selling a business?\n\nHappy to share more about what worked (and what didn't) in my experience, but for now curious on all your thoughts. Thanks in advance!",

We were still doing our finances ourselves, as opposed to having a CFO or a proper finance person do them in-house, which as you suspect is immediately what I hired after going through the initial process.\n\nOn the second failed attempt, I got to the altar, literally the day of closing, and the buyer came back and said that their investment committee had changed their minds. This was after five months of due diligence by the way. That one really hurt.\n\nThe other two occasions, I got approached by public companies directly and started negotiations, but realized that negotiation on my own behalf was a loser's game. I had no leverage and couldn't play hardball and was going to end up with a low offer so I backed out.\n\nCan't share exact multiples, but the final deal was with a PE firm, and was a solid lower middle-market transaction. Fortunately large majority was cash at closing with a small retained equity %, and a small earn-out component tied to growth over the time I stayed on as CEO.\n\nNowadays, I'm working with my son on ExitClarity, an exit readiness platform for business owners considering a sale. My mission really is to try to help others avoid all the mistakes that I made when trying to exit, and if I can do that, maybe it'll feel a little bit like it was worth it taking all those lumps haha.",

After 2 solid years of trying to buy other companies,  I decided I needed an equity partner. \n\nIn the last 4 years, I have been approached at least 3 times per week by brokers, PE. And strategic buyers. I had no intention of selling. Then,  I started talking to them. I was offered an LOI  by a strategic that I really liked for a fair amount of money. I didn't really want to go that route so I declined after a lot of negotiations and soul searching.\n\n I was then approached by a holding company that offered me a platform position. Dream come true, right? They offered me great money, but during the negotiations, they kept changing the deal to the point that we both decided to walk away. \n\nThe M&amp;A advisor from the buyers' side then called me up and said they felt that my company was stronger than the offers I was getting, and they wanted to represent me. We came to an agreement, and they put me in front of 6 different buyers. PE, strategic, and a few other types. \n\nI just sold to my dream buyer. Great track record for growth. I named the terms of the deal and got a high multiple.  They are great to work with, and we are in full acquisition mode as a platform. \n\nIt took many years of building the company I would want to buy, but it paid off. The advice OP is giving is right on. Get an advisor, an M&amp;A CPA, and a good attorney.  You need a quality team. Your CPA will also need to advise you on tax consequences.

In my area it could easily do far more what it does now in events. It has a unique track record though, especially since I acquired it in January of 2021, and the previous owner was ill for several years prior to that, so it was flying by the seat of its pants for quite some time. I happily have a large scale corporate agent who has watched me rebuild it and has a high interest in a strategic partnership. I have another entertainment business (physical with a growing digital component) that I have spent 20+ years building that has global potential, and I would much rather focus on developing that for the next 3-5 years, so this would be a great way for me to work on that with some financial security behind me. But I am learning all this as I go!  The tips for the team to hire in this thread were immediately valuable.\n\n My questions are: How do I start thinking in terms of negotiating value of items, intellectual property compensation, or salaries or pay for team members? I know with this partnership it would be an immediate value addition to their bottom line, and I don't want to sell myself short. They already have trucks, warehouse space, and an administrative team we would integrate into. Without even trying this business easily does 60 events per year and could do 10x that if it had the resources (as demonstrated by a long established competitor) and someone (not me) who thrives on a higher level of activity. I will be bringing them hundreds of new talent members, a whole set of equipment that is ready to make money, a growing client base with dozens of repeat clients, multiple formulas for multiple markets, plus a business name that has been around for over 20 years with a 5 star reputation. Of course there is so much more to the story, but those are the most salient points I can think of to start.\n\nThere was one year where we did over 100 events and still could have booked more, but that was the year I learned what the term \"uncontrolled growth\" meant and I immediately set about controlling it. We grossed $250,000 that year, but this is a VERY people dependent business so that came with a lot of headaches from other people. So I decided I would only do what I knew I could handle with a small trusted crew. We still are easily into six figures, but it operates on a boutique family level at the moment. Various family members lend skill and expertise and it contributes a form of support at the moment for all of us involved. Those family members ideally would be integrated into the partnership to help the transition over the next couple years. \n\nThat was a lot, but things are moving fast (as they always do) so any input is welcome! And if this was just a casual read for anyone, thank you for making it this far!",

I have been in corporate world since 2017 mainly in manufacturing, maintenance and facility engineering, and management experience. Ive done really cool things and built a pretty solid resume. Money has been great but im generally burned out. I several years back that I don't get fulfillment out of working for others but I stayed in the trap. I have my first child otw and I decided to leave a extremely well paying job with great benefits due to a horrible culture which honestly was turning into the worst version of myself. Hind sight, I believe i should have stayed at least until the baby was born and took my paternity leave but i figured if i didnt leave i probably never would. After i left in july, I started my own facilities and equipment consulting business. Ive been struggling on how to get things started even though I have the llc, website, business cards etc. I also dont really know how to sale, if that makes sense. I feel like im losing the fire thats in me that makes me, me. I believe i also have too much ego and pride that has been holding me back for the majority of my life, which i take full responsibility for. The burnout and loss of confidence honestly is tearing me apart as I have a pregnant wife and baby due in 3 weeks. We have a decent nest egg of savings but its tearing me apart as a man. How do I get the drive back and push through to do the one thing ive been wanting to do for years, which is have a business and work for myself. I understand there will be stress in any environment and im willing to grind through, no stranger to hard work. Has anyone experienced this and successfully started there business? Any advice is greatly appreciated. \n\nAlso to add, about 4 years ago we relocated to atlanta for my job and isolated our selves from all friends and family. I didnt realize how much of an impact it would have on me not being social and not having a team in your corner rooting for you. Again, this is all on me and having something to prove to myself at the time. My goal now is to be a good father, husband,  and to have fulfillment in my life with whatever job or business I do.",

Having a baby on the way is not the ideal time to start this full-time. \n\nI'd recommend you find at least a part time job and set realistic goals for business to test its viability. For example: close one client in 30 days. As you get more clients, you start to get a clearer idea of who to target. \n\nFinally invest in learning how to create ads for social media. If you are not ready to cold call, then shoot cold DMs. I wouldn't recommend emails yet because they go to spam and feels like more rejection when no one responds. That's my 2 cents.",

Check out mentally for half the day for a month or 2. You're in a corporate job. Who cares? \n\nIf you're contemplating quitting anyway... just start mailing it in. Don't take your work home with you ...risk a bad review here and there. What are they going to do?  Fire you  ...after several months ...with a nice severance package?  Horrors.\n\nCertainly there's plenty of people in your corporation who are just doing the minimum. Just enough not to get fired.\n\nGive yourself a break from the stress and whatever happens happens. Maybe after a month you recharge and you kick back into gear and everything's good. Maybe you realize you didn't have to work so hard to begin with. Maybe you realize you do need to quit. It's all okay\n\nBut my opinion is if you're already burned out... Entrepreneurship is not the direction you want to go. The corporate folks who think it's the easy, low stress life... Lol.\n\nYou need a break. Not more responsibility and more stress and less money",

So I started reading, watching videos, and just trying to figure things out. And there’s one sentence I keep seeing everywhere, and it obviously makes sense: “Do something you’re good at.”\n\nThe problem is: I don’t really have any skills. There’s nothing I’d say I’m genuinely good at. I’ve always been the type of person who gets fascinated by many things, but because of that, I never truly committed to one. I’ve always stayed “average” at different things, but never became great at any of them.\n\nSo, unlike a lot of people who’ve spent years mastering something they love, I’m in my mid 20s and I have nothing. And honestly, it pressures me a lot. Seeing people around me who have clear skills or passions they’ve worked on for years, it makes me feel behind.\n\nEven when I ask myself, “What do you actually enjoy doing? What could you focus on now?” I don’t have a clear answer. I like many things, but not in a way that makes one stand out above the rest.\n\nRight now, I just feel lost. How do I start? How do I find something that I can genuinely put work and passion into something I can improve in and eventually become good, maybe even professional at?",

A lot of times, they just don't tell you their insecurity.  \nOne thing I found helpful is to document the things you're working on, write them down, take photos or videos, and remember how you feel when you do those different things. When you look back after a while, you'll be amazed at how much you have achieved. Also, you'll start to find the pattern about the things that you can do well easily and the things you find greater joy in.",

I knew I wanted to get into digital products, but every bit of advice was the same *pick something you’re passionate about.* Problem was, I didn’t know what that was. So instead of trying to pick the perfect niche, I started learning the skills, branding, marketing, how online business actually works. The more I learned and stayed in the space, the clearer it got. I started seeing patterns, problems people had, questions they kept asking and that’s where I found my gap. That’s what I ended up building around.

First year hit $120k purely from contracts, then scaled to $500k the next year (though half of that was me being the talent). Year three we crossed $1M and sold to a GSI.\n\n*Here's what nobody tells you*: the \"no upfront capital\" thing is technically true but spiritually a lie. You're converting time into revenue at minimum wage rates while working 80+ hour weeks. Your capital is your sanity, and you're spending it recklessly.\n\nThe actual path? Services. Always services. Freelance consulting, web dev, content creation.. anything where you can invoice within 30 days. Products and SaaS bleed cash for months before you see a dime. With services, you're cashflow positive in weeks, then you can funnel that into something scalable.\n\nPlatforms like Upwork or Fiverr take a commission, but they're essentially free lead generation. Build credibility there, then migrate clients off-platform once you've proven you're not incompetent. After about 6 months of this grind, you'll have enough revenue to justify a proper business structure and start hiring.\n\nReal talk though.. if you're worried about phone charging costs, you're not ready. The barrier isn't capital, it's the ability to tolerate prolonged financial discomfort while building something. Most \"zero capital\" success stories are actually \"I lived off savings/a spouse/ramen for 18 months\" stories with better PR.",

You're right that having competitors validates the market, but wrong about the positioning part.\n\nSaying \"unlike other tools, we don't charge per seat\" only works if that's actually a pain point your customers care about. Most of the time founders pick differentiators that sound good but don't actually matter to buyers.\n\nWhat worked for us was talking to customers who chose competitors over us and asking why. Turned out our \"unique feature\" we were proud of wasn't important. What they actually wanted was faster implementation. So we rebuilt our onboarding and led with that.\n\nThe real issue isn't being scared of competitors. It's building in a vacuum and guessing what makes you different instead of letting the market tell you. Your differentiation has to solve a real problem people are actively frustrated with, not just be theoretically better.\n\nAlso, obsessing over competitors is a trap. I wasted months analyzing their features when I should've been talking to my own customers. They don't care about your competitive matrix.

      "selftext": "My wife and I haven’t been on the same page for a while now and it has taken a real toll on our relationship over the last year or so.\n\nWe have two kids, a 7-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old son, and yeah, it is a lot. I am not going to pretend otherwise.\n\nFor years I have struggled with my job as an accountant. There has always been this deep feeling that I chose the wrong path, and on top of that, I am not even great at it. But I stuck with it for the sake of the family. I even pushed myself to do the ACCA qualification, hoping it would lead to a promotion and better income. It was supposed to take 2 years, but it took me 5. Undiagnosed ADHD and dyslexia definitely did not help, but I pushed through and got it done.\n\nFast forward to about two years ago, a close friend and I started a media studio to host podcasts and shows. We somehow pulled it off with a £30k grant, so there was no financial risk to the family. We now have a high-end studio, multiple shows running, and viral clips on Instagram, some with over 200k views. It is not just a passion project. We have had interest from companies who said if we can get those kinds of numbers consistently, there is business to be done.\n\nThroughout all this, I have made sure to be as responsible and supportive at home as possible. I still work full time at my day job, even though I hate it. I do 50% of the school runs, cook, clean, and everything in between. Everything except breastfeeding id say chores are split 5050. When I work from home, I make sure the kids are sorted and dinner is ready so my wife can relax and have proper time with them.\n\nIf I were single, I would probably be living in the studio trying to make this work full time. But that is not reality.\n\nSo, I have carved out Sundays to work on the studio. Recording, editing, managing everything. It is a lot, but we are seeing steady progress. And even though I am gone the whole day, I try to get things done before I leave. I take the kids to soccer in the morning, hang out at home, and even get some chores done like ironing their uniforms. Then I leave around noon and make sure I am back before bath time. I help with the baths, we do some bedtime reading together, and after that I usually clean up the house so it is all set and ready for Monday.\n\nMy wife is not happy that I am out on Sundays though. She says it is too much to handle on her own. I offered her Saturdays completely off so she can recharge, but then she said we will not have a full day together as a family.\n\nFor context, my business partner also has kids, but he just commits fully regardless of what his wife thinks. I am not really built like that. I try to keep things balanced.\n\nThe hard part is that my wife has never once asked how the business is going. She is not supportive, does not show any interest, and when I asked her directly what she wants from me, she said she wants me to progress in my career. Meaning the one I have been miserable in for over a decade.\n\nWe are in a really bad place right now. We see life differently.\n\nGrowing up, I saw my dad work hard, come home just before bedtime, and we would hang out for an hour. That was enough. He is still my hero. I do not feel like I missed out. But maybe things are different now.\n\nAnyway, just wondering if anyone here has been through something similar. Would really appreciate any thoughts or advice.\n\nEdit: my wife also has a full time job. On the days she works home she will make dinner etc and visa versa. We both work from home 2/3 days so all pretty even ",

We didn't get into finances at all. I purposely left that out of the conversation. \n\nWe discussed what our ideal life would look like five years down the road, no limits. I asked her how she would want to spend her time. I had her describe her ideal day to me. We talked about where we wanted to live, and how much we wanted to travel. \n\nShe got excited about the future. \n\nThen, I reverse-engineered a business idea that would help us achieve that dream lifestyle. I explained my plan to her, but I was also upfront about the sacrifices required. \n\nOver the next 4 years, I built that business with her 100% support. I didn't compromise on family time, which included weekly or bi-weekly date nights (we have three kids). \n\nI walked away from my 9-to-5 job in September 2022 and never looked back. \n\nToday, my wife and I are in our 40s.

          "body": "You are not alone. This type of conflict with immediate family is a common thing for entrepreneurs. This conflict can happen not just with wives and kids but also with parents and siblings.  \n  \nThe reality of entrepreneurship is that a new business takes time and is risky. The people around you are likely selfish, like most people, and want you to use your time to help them, not the business. And the people around you are likely more afraid of risk than you are. Working on your business takes time away from them and makes them feel less safe. So there is conflict as they try to get you back to doing things that are good for them and make them feel safe again.\n\nYou are lucky so far that you have not had financial risk. The conflict can get more intense when the business requires large loans and cutting family spending. People around you will often have a problem with you taking out large loans and spending less on the mere hope of business success.\n\nAll of these things are why entrepreneurs often have divorces and strained relationships with their kids or other family members. It's not guaranteed, but it's not uncommon either.\n\nFrom a purely business perspective, I think you will need more time than just Sundays to have a successful business. You will compete with others and your part time effort will have a hard time winning against their full time effort.\n\nUltimately what to do is your choice. You can tell your wife \"I want to pursue this business and that's what I'm going to do\". You can tell the kids \"we need to stop soccer and other stuff for now so I can focus on my business\". You can choose what you do with your time even if other people do not like your choice.\n\nBut choosing your business may lead to your wife leaving or your kids not liking you. This is why a lot of people stay in jobs and do not become entrepreneurs. Having a corporate job like being an accountant avoids conflict and drama from the family. And you can get by in a job, even if you are unlikely to get rich.\n\nI think this is part of why a lot of entrepreneurs come from non traditional backgrounds. When your options are \"be poor driving for Uber or make my business work\", well making the business work is the best option. When your options are \"make my business work or earn a decent living with my annoying accountant job and see my kids\", a lot of people choose the job.",

          "body": "I can relate to this. My wife was absolutely not supportive when I quit a cushy job to start a business, which I'd dreamed of for years and knew without a doubt to be a large part of my purpose in life. \n\nShe came from a family that relied on having stable jobs, sometimes even more than one, and money was never enough. But I came from a family that put a lot of value on independence and creating your own path, and had found a fair amount of success in doing so. My education, career trajectory, and network of contacts had fully prepared me to venture out on my own.\n\nOf course I had anxieties about the experience, but suddenly I couldn't lean on my wife because she couldn't hear me without internalizing that fear at a primal level. Starting a business is a lonely endeavor and you need support more than ever - not a life partner who adds fuel to the fire. Entrepreneurs need peace at home more than ever. \n\nIn the end, our relationship didn't survive. I went on to grow it and sell the business profitably - to a degree that outpaced what my salary would have ever become, and then started more businesses. She went on to find another stable guy who has worked the same job his whole life. We're both happier that we'd have been had we stuck together, I'm sure. \n\nEntrepreneurship is more than just something you do. It's the fulfillment of aspiration and purpose. If there are people in your life who don't support your aspirations, they may not be the right people for the long haul. But on the other hand, if you don't know from the bottom of your heart that your aspirations are to do this - perhaps you need the support of this partner more than ever and to find other ways to fulfill yourself. \n\nYou're also going through a crazy complicated season of life - when kids enter the picture it's more difficult than ever. I don't understand why western cultures aren't more supportive of young families who have all the responsibility of parenting right at the moment in life when they need to support the full load of a mortgage, student debt, invest massive time in grinding the career, yet also put time in being present at every stage their kids' childhood. As I kid I remember getting dumped at the grandparents house almost every weekend so my parents could still go out and be adults. Now that they retired they are gallivanting around Europe, Hawaii, taking ski trips to Whistler, and everywhere nice instead of being available for the grandkids. What the heck, lol.\n\nPerhaps there are ways to create more sanity by reducing your and your wife's load, such as hiring a nanny, maid, or setting clearer work time/not work time boundaries. Additionally, setting up some goalposts and timelines might reduce anxieties - for example, if you could say: I want to work about X more hours a week on developing my business for X months. If has reached $X income by that time, I'll adjust to X+N hours of work, and reduce my other career time investment so that my availability to the family remains unchanged. This way she might be able to feel more supportive and less like this direction is a cat that isn't going back in to the box.\n\nGood luck, relationships + entrepreneurship is tough.",

I don’t think you would be trying so hard to juggle everything, to be so involved with the home and the kids and your wife and making sure you following a dream isn’t having an ill effect or burdening your wife. You are a thoughtful, kind, empathetic man, you definitely are on a higher level than most men, and the fact that you are offering to give her Saturday to either chill and relax or to pursue her own interests means you want to make sure she has equal and ample opportunity to find what she needs to be fulfilled, rested, and isn’t overwhelmed. I understand her view that if you each get a weekend day to yourself it will reduce family time, but it sounds like your job setups give you a lot of time at home, which I know doesn’t mean you can neglect work or anything, but it’s different than if you both were separated and out of the house all day except the weekends. I feel like maybe she resents that you’ve found success and something to pursue while she doesn’t have the same driving force, ambition, or direction. As we all grow in life finding new things to pursue, motivations, paths, projects, or interests to focus on and pursue we fall in a rut and can get complacent, or maybe she is fulfilled and it makes her insecure. I just feel like her lack of excitement and interest, and her trying to block or guilt trip you into letting go of those, especially after the challenges, setbacks, difficulties, and disillusionment with your career as an accountant (which bravo for staying committed to and still working to increase your knowledge and status despite feeling like this wasn’t the wrong path for you) she should be happy that you have found a path with potential that fulfills you. Especially because you have not let it stop you from being an active partner, involved, and willing to listen to her and compromise, she should be willing to support you, and understand that this part of marriage, there are ebbs and flows, time to be supportive, and time to be supported.

It creates this \"fail while doing something that you really didn't want to do\" situation.  Find it online if you haven't heard the story.

What that feels like to me is you turn this from a Sunday gig to two late nights during the week as an option.  Like, after dinner on M-W (or whenever works) you're doing your studio work until you drop.  That keeps the weekends open and might be more amenable to her.\n\nAnd it sounds like you're doing great work around the house and really trying to be there for her and your kids.  That's great.

Everyone does that.   Not play games, but waste time. Its part of having a job.  But bosses are obsessed about time and not tasks.   25 years ago I was a service manager at a car dealership. The owner insisted everyone clock out at 5pm. Not early.  So during the last 15 minutes of the day people would just stand in a line by the time clock, waiting until exactly 5pm.  So much money wasted. And time.  I've noticed that bosses care more about employees being unhappy that actually getting work done.   I also spent time as a buyer for a company. I could have layed in bed at home and called the places and did the work. Would have been more effective most likely. But I had to go into work, sit at a desk, wear a suit even though nobody from the public was ever in our building, and make calls there.  Half the day I was just sitting there waiting on hold or waiting to make a call.  \n\nThe biggest thing is the person being late or calling off.  That drives me crazy.   Employees that show up are super valuable.   I've ignored employees stealing thousands of dollars from me just because they actually showed up each day and never called off lol. \n\nI'm going to assume you are a new business owner since you are asking these questions.

Phil had broad responsibilities, including purchasing inventory. Over the years, it became clear to them that Phil had deals with some of the vendors for kickbacks paid to him and some other shady dealings. Basically, they knew that Phil was stealing 1-2% of what he was purchasing, which amounted to $100k+ per year.\n\nMy dad told me this, and I (naturally!) asked why he didn't fire Phil on the spot. His reply was a business lesson that stuck with me over the decades since.\n\n\"I could let him go, of course. But I prefer to look at that 1-2% as part of the cost of doing business. Sure, Phil costs the company money with his theft, but he is also so fiercely protective of his grift that he makes sure we get a good deal anyway, so we won't suspect him. Plus, he watches all the other employees like a hawk to ensure they're not skimming, so we won't get suspicious. This way, your mom and I can take a two week vacation if we want to, and we know it costs 1-2%. We can stomach that, and it's worth it for us. Is it right? No. But it's practical.\"\n\nSo, ask yourself - if this employee came to you and said, \"I'll keep doing a great job, but I'm going to steal $100/month worth of time and supplies. Is that OK?\" What would you say? If you'd agree to keep this person, then just pretend that conversation happened and move on. It costs a lot more to find, train, and keep another manager.\n\nIs it right to let this guy steal $10 worth of supplies? Or 40 minutes worth of time? No. But perhaps it's practical.",

Being late once a week isn't really acceptible(unless you think they have a good reason each time)...playing a game on their phone? that is't good but you know...while I am the boss look at me wasting time on here. That doesn't make your managers behavior good(it isn't) but you should talk with them about it)\n\n  \nAs far as the theft of magic erasers. THere has always been that joke about stealing office supplies. Thinking back to the times I have worked for someone....did I ever 'steal'? Not really. Maybe a pen. I remember taking a few enevelopes from the office once but I did later bring a few back in\n\n  \nyou should talk with the employee. I have a couple of employees and they used to always ask if they could take something I had laying around and pretty much always said yes(it was never big items). I wouldn't be surprised if they took a garbage bag or packing tape once in awhile(they'll bring the packing tape back). I did 'catch' one taking a iphone charging cord I had here. It wasn't a big deal but I did tell them I'd appreciate if they would ask in the future because in that case the cord had a specific purpose but I didn't think they were trying to be shady\n\n  \nSo I guess my point isn't that they are a good employee or an awful employee...but rather and employee that maybe became too comfortable and you haven't had the kind of disucssion you need ot have with them.",

Particularly if they have needed to take a second job and are still struggling.\n\nI agree with the top comment chain in that you should take them out for lunch as a gesture of thanks for the past three years, then work your way into a conversation about life outside of work.\n\nTheres not a soul alive that's capable of completely detaching their home life from their work life unless you're some kind of superhuman psychotic.

      "selftext": "**Has anyone else gone through something like this with American Express?**  If so, I would love to know **how to deal with this issue**, I will be contacting them tomorrow (Monday) morning. If you have dealt with it, how did you resolve it?\n\nI’ve been with Amex for over 25 years. Between my business and personal cards, I’ve probably run somewhere between $30–50 million through them over that time. Never missed a payment. **Never had a problem. I have paid early EVERY month** on my Plum card to receive the cash back. My personal credit score is over 800.  My business has been more profitable every year it has been in existence.  There should be zero flags to show a problem.\n\nThen out of nowhere, this past Saturday evening around 6:45 PM, I get an email saying my available credit limits have been reduced on all six of my cards. I thought it had to be spam. Logged in and it was real. Every single card had its limit cut dramatically, some by as much as 90%.\n\nThat instantly made several cards show as “over limit” by tens of thousands of dollars, even though I hadn’t made a new charge. Just because Amex decided to lower the limit after the balance was already there.  No warning, no explanation. Just an email after hours on a weekend.\n\nNow I have personal cards showing a balance greater than the credit limit, which will negatively impact my credit score if the credit bureau happens to pull the data today.\n\nSo I called the number on the back of the card and got sent to a recording saying underwriting was closed until Monday morning. There was no way to get past that prompt once I put my card info in.  They sent the email ten minutes after they closed, so there was literally no way to talk to anyone. Perfect timing, right?\n\nNow imagine if I were traveling internationally or needed those cards to cover scheduled payments. Too bad. They just stop working. Some of mine already declined Sunday morning for pending charges, and of course Amex won’t be covering any fees or fallout from that.\n\nI tried the chat on their site, spent 15 minutes explaining everything, only to be told I needed to call a “special number” where someone could help me as a “long time valued customer.” I called it, and got the same voicemail saying to try again Monday.  Valued customer...right.\n\nSo here I am, 25 years of loyalty, perfect history, and six suddenly crippled accounts that I can’t even use because someone at Amex flipped a switch and didn’t think about what that does to small business owners who rely on those cards every day.\n\nIf this can happen to me, it can happen to any of you. And it raises real questions about how Amex handles risk, or maybe just their cash exposure, without giving long-time customers any warning or chance to prepare.\n\nFor small business owners, this is something to think about before making Amex your main line of credit. Because “member since 1998” apparently doesn’t mean much when their algorithm or someone working risk on a weekend decides to cut you off on a Saturday night.",

Said letter must also disclose source of any information used to make said decisions. This usually will be information from credit reporting agencies.\n\nWith Amex usually it's because something triggered an in depth review of at least one account. When this happens Amex will usually do a hard pull on credit report and going by what they find results can be what has happened to OP. Credit limits reduced, cards closed, etc....\n\nOf course when one account is affected it prompts action with all others someone has with Amex, again Citi and other CC issuers all do same thing.\n\nKeep in mind it may not be something one has done with Amex (or Citi or whoever) that triggers these sort of actions. Simply pulling hard credit report and finding something they don't like recently with any other credit related bit on report can trigger actions.\n\nThat is to say if one CC issuer (say Amex) finds account holder has high utilization, missed payments, and or anything else they view as negative with another bank or CC they can take action.",

Instead, I stumbled into a strange pattern I didn’t see coming.\n\nWith the first couple of friends, we swapped life updates, and when I shared some good news about how things had turned out for me with my small online business, the conversations just… fizzled. They stopped replying, or in some cases blocked me completely. It felt weird because I wasn’t trying to brag, just telling them what I’d been up to.\n\nThat threw me off, so with the next people I found, I downplayed my life situation and kept things simple. Suddenly, the conversations flowed and we stayed in touch. In fact, some of the people who ghosted me originally became cool with me again after I told them I’d “exaggerated” my story the first time around.\n\nIt made me realize how unpredictable people’s reactions can be when you reconnect after years. I thought sharing positive news about business success would be encouraging, but in reality it sometimes made old friends uncomfortable. On the flip side, being more low-key has kept the door open.\n\nI guess the lesson I learned is that not everyone wants to hear about your successes, even if you’re just trying to share your story. Sometimes keeping it simple and focusing on old memories is the better way to reconnect. This kinda reminds me of how some lottery winners have stories of suddenly finding a few of their friends and family members to be resentful of them after winning.\n\n#Edit:\n\nI run a one man web design business where small mom and pop shops and blue collar businesses pay a small fee each month to manage their company websites. I don't see how any of these guys would've thought I was trying to pitch them an MLM when the conversation of what we do for a living came up.",

These hotels aren’t in great shape, but they’re far from ruins... they’re fully operational and listed on Booking.\n\nSome prices are wild (for example, found this one with [50 rooms for €450,000](https://www.buythathotel.com/listing/scenic-hotel-for-sale-in-tabiano-terme)). Of course, they’re not in top locations like Lake Como or the Amalfi Coast, but... it’s still Italy, with its culture, great food.\n\nAll the ones I’ve looked at are run by elderly owners who just want to retire. They have zero tech or marketing skills and haven’t invested much in the properties over the past decade.\n\nSo I figured that with some alternative concepts, like coliving, it would be nearly impossible not to make money (or at least be able to sell in a few years for a profit). Bureaucracy will probably be an issue, but that’s the case everywhere in Southern Europe.\n\nSo what’s the catch?",

          "body": "My on-the-ground anecdotal perspective (American expat living in a Ligurian tourist town):   \n  \n1 - Italy's population is skewed older... the typical value-add things like marketing, digital presence, have zero value to the biggest demographic. This spans across industries - hardly anyone has a website, and if they do it looks like one from the 1990's.   \n  \n2 - Italians really seem to like to preserve the traditional things - e.g., in my part of Liguria, they actively discourage street performers, creative artists, any non-Italian cuisine. There is a lot of local government regulation put into preserving the status quo. (this has pros and cons but for your purposes, probably a con)  \n  \n3 - You really should look into the tax situation and labor rights. You will quickly find that the economics are really tough and entrepreneurial success is essentially disincentivized big time, IMO. As a result, 'bare bones' businesses seem to be the norm - both my veterinarian and my optometrist have no web presence, make appointments by texts via WhatsApp, and they are the receptionist, the doctor, the accounting department and the cleaning staff in their business. i.e. sole proprietors, no employees.   \n  \nGood luck!",

From what he has told me, it is too much expenses  (and government corruption fees) all the time to keep it running and maintenance is a nightmare. It never ends, I can vouch for that. Customers want 5 stars hotel by paying 40 dolars a night and then complain about everything and beyond, with a bad review to boot. It is though work to barely even make a profit. He has been trying to sell it for years.",

Run a ln hotel in Milan can be really different from running an hotel in the south.\nYou may both have success in making a capsule hotel or a real rural and traditional hotel but you need to know where it is located.\nThat said be prepared to pay for really High labour costs (skyrocketed by taxes you have to pay for the worker if u hire him).\nIn general nobody here is against a foreigner owner, but they will tell you how to handle the hotel because people will expect Italian logics and standards.\nDon't expect a neutral management.\nThe cheap costs may require, by contract, you to restore the building if you buy it and so on.",

We’ve been paying everyone directly via bank transfers, Paypal, manual invoices, etc. since, for the time being, all our personnel are based in the US and we have no overseas contractors. But with tax season coming around the corner and our personal/business expenses being more mixed than ever, we want to avoid the same headache since we’ve only added employees to our payroll, so we’re looking to get payroll software to help us run this less manually. \n\nWe saw a few demos of ADP, Gusto, Rippling, etc. that all seem to pitch themselves well so we’re a bit torn. It’d be great to get feedback from other small businesses on your experiences and what you guys have used for payroll. It’d be amazing if you could chime in and let me know what tools made all these easier for you. We’re only open to cloud-based solutions only, nothing on-prem, thank you. ",

Rippling’s great for multistate payroll and for remote employees because it has built-in compliance for local, state and federal taxes so you don’t need to monitor as closely for compliance as when you log pay manually.

Oftentimes, a finance company or an accounting company will be one of those that can also do payroll for you for small fee.

One incident that stands out happened two weeks ago when he scolded me for leaving him in the “To” field of an email.\n\nHere’s what happened:\nHe sent an email to a vendor, addressed to them with me on cc. I wanted to add some extra info for the vendor, so I hit reply all. In doing so, my client ended up in the “To” field and the vendor in “cc.” Later that week, he actually scolded me for it on a call.\n\nI was surprised because I can’t see how that would have had any practical effect. The vendor still got the message and replied to it. I get that it’s a small etiquette thing, but to me it feels like a non-issue.\n\nNow he’s also started raising his voice at the vendor on calls, accusing them of being unprofessional when I honestly think they weren’t. I’m leaning toward ending the relationship, but I’d like to sanity-check myself first.\n\nWas I really out of line with that email, or is this just another sign that the client is being unreasonable?",

We ended up completely redesigning our product to eliminate the part and ended up using 100% China-sourced parts for the new design. \n\nWe need to stop thinking of these economic decisions as having any mass beneficial cause. Trump and his cronies are dividing up the carcass of the United States. They are accelerating the fall so they can be the ones in power when it collapses with plenty of Fart Coin available in their personal coffers so they can buy up the pieces just like the Russian oligarchs did for state-owned companies after the fall of the Soviet Union. THIS is the collaboration Trump had with the Russians.

And my customer base is US manufacturers, who are also doing surprisingly well.\n\n\n\nI'm an importer as a service. I import components for US manufacturers. All of it comes from China. They use those components in their US manufacturing facility to assemble into their finished good.\n\nMy business is up this year.\n\n  \nI can only speak for myself and what my clients are doing/ told me. Other's experiences are their own. \n\nAs of last week, to date, I had only had one order cancelled due to the tariffs. They decided to make it in-house. Which they were tooled up to do.\n\nThat particular good, the tariff is 98%. The economics of it, that's not 98% increase in cost. Tariffs were already 28% before all this. So though 70% is a big increase, not terrible when you look at the overall impact to the client. That +70% on EXW. Which means before tariff, freight, my markup. Then it's their COG. Which, the actual cost of goods portion of their cost, is relatively small.\n\nThen this week, they decided to order through me from China anyway. What they calculated was that their cost to make it in house, was about the same as importing it. So by importing it, he's got his employees working on developing new products. \n\nSo in the end, now haven't lost any business due to the tariff. I was able to absorb some of the extra, and they are absorbing some. So far, as far as I know, none of my clients have had to increase their cost to the consumer. Though again, that's clearly because of the structure of me targeting US manufacturers, and how the actual percent that affects everything being minor. For those who import finished goods to sell to the consumer, it must be brutal.\n\nBeyond that, the 98% is a rare occurrence for my stuff. Most of my stuff is between 50-60%. Which it was 25-30% before. So not a huge increase. And again, it's still on EXW vs COG. So I absorb it for the most part. Sure, lower margin for me. But i'm getting more orders than before because that's how my US manufacturer clients are choosing to reduce cost.\n\nSo I am gaining market share. I'm getting more business. So i'm doing better than ever.",

          "body": "This post comes up a lot. Here's my reply the last time I saw this:\n\n&gt; My background is that I am a senior freelance website architect and full-stack developer. I am a small business owner for over 15 years and I run my own operation. One area of my business is building brochure sites, landing pages, and simple homepages for small businesses. I also build custom solutions for WordPress, and full WordPress websites for small-to-medium size businesses.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If your choice is between Squarespace, Wix, and WordPress, I highly recommend you select WordPress. It is a highly performant blogging platform and content management system. The team who builds it has significant investment and they update it constantly.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Because it's updated so frequently, you do need to perform consistent maintenance and updates, but other than that, it's a stellar platform.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I recommend Wordfence, Contact Form 7, Flamingo, Relevanssi, hCaptcha for WordPress, and WP Super Cache. These plugins are my standard install, and they basically hit every major point you need to worry about. They all have free options available, and do not require paying. The paid options are worth it though. CF7 deserves more donations.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If you are on a strict budget, I would host directly with WordPress.com and choose a nice off-the-shelf theme. For reference, WordPress.org is the free, open source self-hosted version. Most recent themes support the block editor, and you should be good to go. If you're looking at Woocommerce, Storefront is an excellent theme.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I'm not super familiar with Squarespace, but I am intimately familiar with Wix. This past year I was tasked with an emergency job to revamp a Wix site for a client who wanted to host a charity event. It cost the client a significant amount of money; far more than would have been needed if we had gone with my recommendation of a custom WordPress theme and plugin set.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When small business clients come to me asking for consultation, I ask one question:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Do you need to update your website constantly, like posting articles, blogs, events, courses, etc., or do you really just need a brochure site? Most small businesses need a small brochure site, with about 1 hour of maintenance/updates per month.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If you really just need a brochure site, a capable website developer who offers what I offer, static landing pages, is going to be far more effective for your business than managing a content management system. Ask for on-page SEO, and the following integrations: Google Analytics, Search Console Integration, Facebook/Meta pixel, Microsoft Clarity, and a one-way contact form. Your #1 traffic source is going to be Google Business Profile/Maps Integration, so ask if they can consult with you on that too.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Invest in your online presence, but don't get taken for a ride. I would strongly recommend hiring a qualified website developer who you can work with intimately one-on-one, and doesn't pass you off to a random support team. I can't emphasize enough how frustrating working with Wix support was.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nrkd8t/what_is_the_best_website_builder_for_a_small/ngiqb34/",

Your dad, while you love him, is his own individual person making a living and making business decisions the way he chooses to make them. It’s sad, but I promise you he doesn’t care how you take this other person in the business. You need to start viewing him as a boss instead of your dad in this regard. Separate the two universes. He may be a great dad, but not the best business person too. I love my dad, he’s awesome personally, but I couldn’t get out of there fast enough after college, we all have different personalities.\n\n2. You don’t want to stay in a family business. Go start your own venture. Go do something on your own for a while and maybe come back to it. Show him you’re worth it by pursuing other opportunities first and then he’ll realize how important you are. The guy he hired is temporary. As parents age, he will eventually start thinking about handing off the business to you or selling to someone else. Again, he’s his own person making decisions (not your dad).\n\n3. You’ll have a much better relationship with dad not being in his business. Trust me. It’s just a totally different dynamic.",

Pretty happy with it overall - the compliance stuff is handled, payments are smooth, etc.\n\nHere's my situation: i am bringing on a business partner and we're merging operations. Between us, we'll have maybe 10-12 contractors instead of the 5-6 i have now. He's been managing his contractors differently.\n\nI am wondering if it's still makes sense to keep everyone on the same platform I'm using now, or if at this size there are better options? fees are starting to add up but i also value not having to think about international compliance and tax stuff.\n\nfor those who scaled a remote team - did you stick with your initial platform?\n\nNot trying to bash my curent provider at all, just trying to figure out the smartest move as we grow.\n\nthx for any insights",

Misclassify and you'll owe back taxes plus penalties.

It could be gym at 7-8, cook a good breakfast, a walk in the park from 9-11am then a coffee date with my partner and then a trip into the city in the afternoon, then a cheap comedy show in the evening.

The issue is you’re not gonna be able to sustain that type of hustle for very long.\n\nMy advise from owning three different businesses: take care of yourself first (physically and mentally) and the business will follow suite. You can’t expect yourself to perform well in any business or job if your body and mind are on life support.\n\nGo for walks, take small breaks throughout the day, go to the gym, play video games, read books, eat healthy food, etc.\n\nDo what you like to do so you don’t get burnt out. Running a business is not a sprint or cramming for an exam, it’s a marathon where you need to prepare and take care of yourself first to do well. You’re in it for the long haul. \n\nIf it was easy and simple, everyone would be running a successful business.",

Then came COVID-19 and issues with crime threatened my business in San Francisco CA.  I persevered and can technically retire fairly comfortable today.  But even though I am burned out I want to continue my business until I am 65 maybe 70. I am a glutton for punishment. Was it worth it.  I will answer yes and no.  You know that the success rate for businesses past 5 years is 50%.  I wish you well.",

The other is a place we purchase supplies from over the last 8 years is shutting the doors after 40 years. The physical change in these 2 men as their business slowly failed over 1-2 years and collapsed is terrifying.  They are shells of themselves. I am not sure either will recover if im honest. I can see how easy it would be to keep throwing in the effort to trying and savage the situation but the toll they took on themselves I dont think is worth it. \n\nAs small business owner do you think you'd fight until there is nothing left to fight for and go down swinging or throw the towel in sooner and find something else possibly saving your sanity but loosing your business?",

But then under \"Contact a Lender\" it literally named two of their competitors by name. It straight up told people to call these other businesses. \n\n  \nAlthough their site was mentioned in the carousel, it wasn't mentioned in the answer at all. \n\nThat query was high intent, and although the users domain ranks top 5 in the blue links and was included in the carousel, it wasn't referred and they got cut out compeletely. \n\n  \nI'd honestly recommend everyone here to take 5 mins asking Google/ChatGPT/Perplexity etc questions about your business and see what happens. Are you getting recommended (not just in the carousel but in the answer) or is your competiton. \n\nFull disclosure, my work is in this space, so I'm looking at these results all day and thought it was an important warning to share with other business owners who rely on search for customers. \n\nAnyone else seeing stuff like this in their industry?

I don't. \n\nFor the most part what would be better is if the product and the consumption cycle simply didn't exist. I feel that way about storage products too i guess. I want less stuff. I don't want to store more stuff. As for christmas, i guess I also don't want any tyoe of storage for christmas whether its eco friendly or not. I think consumers feel a lot of pressure to buy stuff all the time and advertising is intense and they are tapped out. The tariffs are having negative worldwide effects on tons of industries and billions of people too. People have less to spend now in my opinion.\n\nI am in the kids toys industry (which may seem ironic given what I just wrote lol) and feel like eco friendly is pretty much a scam or juat greenwashing in this industry. There is nothing eco friendly about plastic from China (or anywhere else but shipping it from very far away just adds to the idiocy of our entire world economy) period. Money is the ultimate determinant of where things get made, not environmental concerns.  Sometimes things are made from wood from places like indonesia using tapped out rubber trees. I really don't think that's much better either. The human labor and the shipping alone. There are recycled plastic toys made in the USA but they are outrageously expensive and customers care more about their money than a toy made in the US from recycled materials.  Toys made from recycled plastic, esp stuffed animals are just putting tons of micro plastics out there, and the toy industry is really on a consumption based blind box craze atm which is largely fueled by Chinese brands. It's just gambling and getting people to buy more crud.",

Eco-friendly is a tiebreaker when price and quality are equal - it's rarely the primary driver. The exception is younger demographics (Gen Z especially) who will pay a small premium (5-10%) if you can tell a compelling story about the impact.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What actually sells:\\*\\* Durability and functionality trump eco-credentials every time. If your sustainable product also happens to be more durable or multifunctional, that's the angle to lead with. \"This storage bench will last 10 years\" sells better than \"This storage bench is eco-friendly.\"\n\n\n\n\\*\\*On Christmas storage being down:\\*\\* I think you're onto something. People are buying fewer, higher-quality decorations rather than seasonal clutter. The Marie Kondo effect is real - consumers are moving away from accumulating things that only get used once a year.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Multifunctional is the future:\\*\\* This is the trend with the most staying power.

I had to purge 40 years of that stuff from my dad's house, and I swear, if it doesn't fit in a suitcase, I am not getting it. Plus, we will choose diapers and formula for grandbabies over furniture, every day.",

          "body": "In my industry, sustainability gets pushed so hard. \n\nSo we decided to dig deeper and actually ask customers what they cared about. Here’s what we found, in order:\n\n1. **Aesthetic** – Does this product align with their vision? Does it feel like theirs?\n1. **Price** – Does the cost match what they’re getting?\n1. **Features** – Do the USPs actually matter to them?\n1. **Perceived Quality** – Will it last? Will it do the job?\n\nSustainability didn’t even make the list. When we specifically asked about it, customers were actually wary, they associated sustainable products with being expensive and lower quality.\n\nI’m not saying sustainability doesn’t matter, but it’s not the primary USP. It’s so far down the list.",
