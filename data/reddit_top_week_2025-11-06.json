      "selftext": "Background: I run a small international snack brand called Pop Snax, which I started 2 years ago. Initial operations were out of my apartment where snacks took up every inch of space, lol. I've grown steadily over the last year, and I'm now working out of a co-warehouse space.\n\nAnyway, last Sunday, something wild happened. A huge influencer (Joe Bartolozzi) who randomly ordered one of my mystery snack boxes in August, unboxed it on stream/Youtube. Had no idea who he was so I had no idea he was even placing an order. Within hours, my website traffic exploded. Shopify was dinging nonstop.. I got over 300 orders in two days. I was super confused at first and asked a customer how they found me, and that's when I found out about the influencer unboxing.\n\nI cried almost constantly for the first 2 days bc this was one of those surreal “this is actually happening” moments, and I had no idea what I'd done to deserve this. Since last Sunday, orders have been heavy and consistent and the video featuring my box has hit 850k views!\n\nWhile running the business, I also work a full-time job, so, I've been running on fumes trying to keep up with customer emails, packing, and fulfilling, often late into the night. It's been exciting, but also kind of chaotic.\n\nAnyway, this viral moment has given me my first real taste of HEAVY demand at scale, but its also exposed how under-resourced I am as a solopreneur. I don’t have a team yet, or fulfillment support, and I’m still figuring out how to maintain that momentum after the viral wave calms down.\n\nEven with the boost, I know growth won't be linear. There’s still the day-to-day grind I'm trying to figure out, i.e. running ads, improving packaging, managing costs, dealing with platform issues (looking at you, Amazon 😅), and trying to make every customer happy. I'm trying to get deep into AI, so I can offload some of that pressure/manual oversight.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything! And if anyone else here has gone viral with a product or business, how did you handle the surge? Did you manage to sustain it afterward?",

Find some students to come help with packing and shipping so you can focus on the more strategic work.  Get some lined up, explaining the work will be sporadic.  Only bring them in when the surge in orders will cover the staffing expense.  If you can afford it, pay some for a few hours of training so they are ready when you need manpower\nInstall cameras in your work areas so you can keep an eye on them… you’ll soon see which are worth keeping around. Identify not only those who are good at the packing, shipping etc, but also look for those who have an “ownership mindset” who think like business people and who bring their brain to the job, not just the muscle.\nWhen you find those exceptional “owners” invest in mentoring them, involve them in marketing g and inventory and anything else you can expose them too… they become your key employees\nTry to complement your skills.if you are a great marketer, look for bookkeeping instincts.  If you love sourcing new products and managing pipelines. Look for online marketing thinkers\nInvest as much profit as you can into staffing, if you staff right, that will drive growth faster than anything\nAnd, if you don’t have a detailed business plan, write one.  The better you are at identifying key milestones and inflection points, the faster you will build the business. every library has books on writing business plans… take this step seriously and it will pay off.\nFinally, as soon as time allows, get yourself an advisory board; potential\nMentors with experience in areas you don’t know well.  They can help you refine your planning, help you avoid the predictable mistakes most new business owners make, and make connections that will support your businesses growth.  I’m not talking about big name advisors, I mean a friend of your parent who is a CPA, a local shopowner who understands cash flow, a retired exec who can help with strategy and bank contacts, etc.\nGood luck!",

If you have a local church thrift store, start there, or ask your family/friends if they’re getting rid of anything. I sell EVERYTHING I can on eBay.

Right now the economy has caused a lot of pullback in spending, but the eBay store still makes sales as people are looking for used items and deals. \n\nBetting is hard to master. Trading is even harder. They’re both tough skills, but sports betting arbitrage is the strategy I’ve used to become profitable.\n\nWish you the best",

I’d recommend not going for copywriting, dropshipping, reselling etc… every top g with an online university is teaching that shit and it’s such an overcrowded space where only a select few actually get good cash. My recommendations would bet to go for an actually desired skill that you can scale and start freelancing. For example: digital art (if u’re good at drawing or are willing to learn), 3d designing in blender, video editing, thumbnail designing, logo designing, album cover art designing, website development, and there’s just so much more this is just to name a few.\n\nSeriously, don’t go for copywriting or dropshipping. It’s not only that it’s hard it’s just so oversaturated and luck based. If you actually become good at one of the skills I listed you will have 0 problems in getting paid as long as your work is good. It’s not easy, it’s not a “get rich quick” scheme, but if you are actually trying to build something without depending on luck it’s the best option. Also you would be really surprised on how good you can get in a couple of months with focused effort. Im well off working full time as a video editor now and I still wish I started earlier myself.",

Around where I live in Liverpool daily if walk down different streets close to my house and virtually every single house or flat has been given their own wheelie bins and not just one each they've usually got 3 each or sometimes 2 each! \nOne for general waste, one for recycling and the other for gardening waste! \nAnd I noticed quite often I'd walk past certain wheelie bins and there would be a terrible smell coming from them! Even when they where empty and had the lids closed! \nAnd I know that's probably through no fault of their own, because obviously stuff get out inside the bins that is is going to have a bad smell sometimes. It's only normal!! \n\nBut then I thought to myself.........I've never actually seen anybody at all in my local area specifically! Cleaning out their wheelie bins! \n\nI mean, have you ever seen anyone cleaning their wheelie bins? \nIt's not the nicest job, it's dirty and it stinks and nobody wants to do it do they, but!!! If I asked around the houses in the streets in my local area first. In a small radius of my own house and/or advertised wheelie bin cleaning to your door! Possibly starting at £4 per bin?! I don't know?! \nTo start off with I personally think all id need to clean people's wheelie bins is a bucket, I a large sponge or a few, a large scourer or scrubbing implement (or possibly a few) \nSome overalls (or Personal protective equipment) \n\nSome latex gloves or even some marigolds would suffice!  And maybe sometimes I might require a face mask. And some cleaning agent or other dependant on what the local council's guidelines are on stuff like that, if your allowed to use bleach or not I don't know it would have to be researched!!\n\nAnd I thought initially you could go house to house and if they agree to have a wheelie bin or two or three cleaned by myself all I would need to do is ask them to put some hot water in my empty bucket (like the window cleaners do at every single house) \n\nAnd get the wheelie bin flat on the floor and get on my hands and knees and get it cleaned with a bit of elbow grease! \nI'm not scared of a bit of hard work and some horrible smells sometimes haha! \n\nSo if they agreed to have one bin cleaned that would be £4 per house\n2 bins is £8 per house \n3 bins is £12 per house, \nThen you work out how many houses would actually agree to have their wheelie bins cleaned, because it's not a job anyone really wants to do. And like I said in the beginning.....I've never actually ever seen anyone ever cleaning their wheelie bins! \n\nI've had a quick look into it in my area of Liverpool and there's not any regular wheelie bin cleaners and it would hopefully be a very low start up cost when starting out if all I used was a bucket I carried around containing my sponges or scourers or scrubbing brushes plus the correct cleaning agents that is permitted by my local council. \nAnd my gloves and overalls. (Personal protective equipment):\n\nAnd that's it! \n\nObviously if it took off and a lot of locals did want their bins cleaning I could then possibly increase the prices per bins to maybe £5 per bin, £6 per bin, I don't know, and you could possibly have a few extras that could have an extra cost maybe £1/£2 per bin for a spray of an air freshener that maybe includes an antibacterial property when their bin has finished being cleaned? \nI dunno just a thought!\n\nYou could also maybe sell numbers or stickers that can be bought for an extra cost for each bin with their house number stuck on the sides or something like that? \n\n\nWhat do people think about this for an idea of a start up business? \n\nObviously when and if I can hopefully start earning an income I can then buy the business a pressure washer or a trolley with a handle I can wheel round with me with my equipment on it. \n\nBut I really do think it could take off. Especially where I live. Due to the fact that I said many houses wheelie bins smell bad and are really dirty as expected, but I've never seen anyone cleaning them! \n\nAnd then this could be a regular service, maybe once a month or fortnightly or even weekly if the customer wanted! \n\nI think I'm going to do as much research into the idea as I can during the winter months and get as much information from the local council and try getting things set up for myself and get some advertising and marketing made up so I'm ready to launch this little business when the weather starts to warm up. \n\nGet some promotions figured out and set up. \n\nI'm really looking forward to it, and if all else fails......I won't of spent a lot of money and lost it. \n\n\nCan anyone give me any thoughts on what they think personally please? Id really appreciate it! Thanks",

If you are super stressed though your blood pressure might be too high to get it done. I had a bad week at work and couldn’t get it done at all that week 😥. \n\nSurveys aren’t what they used to be. They use to ask you all qualifiers at the beginning and now they ask you some at the end so they don’t have to pay you. If you are just going to waste time in an attempt to make money, you would have better time using ai to create some funny shorts for tiktok instead. \n\nIf you like to play games on phone try testerup/copper kind of apps. You won’t get paid a lot or fast but at least you can turn some of your gaming time into cash. \n\nWith some caution, check out facebook marketplace and Craigslist for jobs and free items you could resell near you. \n\nYou can also look into clinical trials, but always remember they could go bad. Had my asthma get worse doing one trial so I haven’t done one since. \n\nIf you aren’t continuing to rack up debt, then try debt consolidation to help lower what you owe back and make payments more manageable. Once you do that only keep one credit card and cancel the rest. Temptation is too strong. \n\nIf you can drive you might want to look into an old but decent car. Try brands that are easy to get replacement parts for and fix yourself. Be careful of dodge’s battery placement type things 😑. If not and biking isn’t an option, maybe see about carpooling with someone who lives near you. Offer to pay them so much a week to tag a long. My hubby takes 3 to work and they each give him $20/week so it pays the weekly gas costs. \n\nI hope it gets better for everyone and soon. You should be able to have a little fun at least if you work. Not just barely scraping by. Good luck and hang in there. 🤞😖",

You can state what you want to earn per hour or per job or say you need to make an estimate and put your phone number. If you have anything you can say about yourself like, “former maintenance technician “ or whatever…  You can move furniture, fix things, haul things, car repairs, clean houses, walk dogs.

Most of the ideas that worked for me didn’t come from being creative, they came from being too curious for my own good.\n\nIt started with Google Trends. I swear, I used to check that thing more than the weather. Not the usual “past year” stuff either, I’m talking “past hour.” Watching random keywords spike in real time was like a mini dopamine hit. Half the time it was garbage, but every once in a while, it was gold.\n\nThen I stumbled onto a site that pulled data faster, same concept, just way quicker. It blew my mind how most viral products start off as these quiet little searches that slowly build before exploding. Once I started spotting the same keyword popping up in different time frames, I knew something was coming.\n\nTwitter (sorry, X, whatever) is another rabbit hole. I don’t even follow big names, I scroll tiny accounts. When someone with 2k followers goes unexpectedly viral, I don’t care about the person, I care about what they posted. If the topic starts echoing across platforms, I know I’ve got something.\n\nPinterest was the cherry on top. Likes die fast, but saves stick. When I see a design that people keep saving, that’s usually my signal. More than once, I’ve seen that exact same design start trending on Etsy or TikTok a few weeks later.\n\nNone of this feels like a strategy. It’s just me connecting dots, poking around, and moving fast before everyone else realizes what’s happening. It’s part luck, part habit, part insomnia. But hey, curiosity’s been paying better than creativity lately.\n\nAnyone else treat the internet like a detective game?",

But I’m now doing the free daily spins etc, so it might speed up.  I do a survey when I’m in the bathroom 😆.\n\nThere’s the healing steps, card collection, surveys (boring but easy), and games.  \n\nMy referral code is PeacefulRhinoceros9144\n\nYou get 150 and I get 100 wards (points) once you accumulate 200 total wards.  That took me like two days.  Did a survey or two to get there fast.  The walking is fun, just have to remember to hit the convert my steps button on the Home Screen at the end of the day, or you can do it throughout the day.  I collect the cards too on the map 🗺️ feature while walking, and you can even do it in a car.  Be safe and don’t do it driving, but if I’m riding I grab them as we drive.  If you use my code, I’ll send you the extra cards I collect all the time.",

My doorbell rang and I opened the door... A 20 year old woman, blond hair, maybe 120 lbs, in pink rubber overalls, long eyelashes and I swear there was glitter. She looked like Barbie. She said, I am here to fix your septic. I looked in the driveway for someone else, assuming she was assisting. Nope, all I say was a white and pink pickup truck. I went back in the house. 1 hour later doorbell rings. She said all fixed, she rebuilt biofilter and tested all systems. I had to ask. I told her I was not expecting her when I was told someone was coming. She said instead of going to college like her friends she worked entry level at a septic company making $20 per hour. Now, 3 years later she makes $45 per hour and %20 of all repairs. Last year she made just shy of $140k. She said they cant find enough employees.. And she makes 3x the $ her college graduate friends make. I have experienced the same thing before with an 18 year old HVAC tech, who made $75 per hour. Not enough people. And a 24 year old electrician. How is it possible not to make 100k as a yound healthy adult?",

          "body": "You can try social media and tap into MomTok. Theres plenty of TikTok accounts of moms making food for their kids, doing mom housework etc. but you could stand out by cooking real good food. Most of those TikTok’s are just a woman heating up pizza pockets and pouring some chips onto a plate and calling it “lunch”. If you’re actually a good cook you could tap into that market. Show prep, show the cooking process for both your husband and kid’s food, show the cleanup, etc. brand them in different ways. Maybe one TikTok is about a quick meal you can make in 20m that’s still healthy. Make “games,” out of it for better content. For example, pull random ingredients out of your cupboards and pantry. Then cook a legit meal with those random ingredients. Title it something like “no groceries, no problem! A healthy weekday meal in 30 minutes with random ingredients from the pantry!” Or something. \n\nWhat do you post on your YouTube channel? Try double uploading when you make new videos/shorts. Instead of uploading only to YouTube you can use apps that will upload to multiple platforms at the same time. I’d start with YouTube shorts (as that sounds like what you’re making already) TikTok and Instagram reels\n\nRecord and edit multiple videos then schedule them as uploads. This way you can make a ton of content on that 1 day a week, then gradually publish them throughout the week until your next content creation day. Though obviously change outfits and etc so it seems like another day.",

      "selftext": "The idea came from someone that runs a disney holidays comparison website. She makes about 3k a month from the website while working about 3-4 hours a month on it. Most of her traffic comes from SEO which means that she barely has any costs. She earns a commission when users book through her affiliate links to sites like Booking.com.\n\nThis sounds awesome but the intitial work she put in was massive. Months and months of content writing.\n\nFor the last year I've been deep diving in vibe coding. I have some previous experience with SEO. I heard about her succesfull project and thought well I can do that as well without grinding as much.  I'll let AI do the website coding (no wordpress or CMS) and the content writing (using markdown format).\n\nThere are javascript libaries that allow you to load markdown as SEO optimized content on a web project. Lots of frontend developers have blogs that use this structure. Yet this structure is barely used in the affiliate marketing/SEO world.\n\nOf course I couldnt just copy her niche, that wouldnt be fair so I came up with a similiair yet different niche. A theme park the size of a disney theme park but a little less known. I expect to make about 1500 dollar a month from this project at the end of next year.\n\nMy first step was to create a rock-solid plan. I spent a few hours outlining a detailed, phased plan for the entire project. This document detailed the exact folder structure, the required reusable components like headers and footers. (all done with the help of my friend Google Gemini). next step was the split the plan in different phases and let my AI assistants complete the development for each phase.\n\nWhile the coding AI was churning out pages, I put another AI to work on the content. I gave it the topics and keywords, and it wrote all the descriptions for the accommodations, the SEO texts for the pages, and several blog posts, all formatted in Markdown. This content is loaded directly into the website (using mdx), no complex CMS needed.\n\nFrom the initial idea to a fully functional, content-rich website deployed on Vercel for free, the entire process took just under two weeks.\n\nI'm currently letting Google index my project and have more content to be published in my pipeline. So far the project looks incredibly promising. Will share more results once I have them.",

      "selftext": "Over the years, I explored many side hustles, including dropshipping, freelancing, affiliate marketing, and print-on-demand. I felt that whenever I discovered a promising opportunity, something kept me from pursuing it. Whether it was a complex technology, a disheartening market, or something else entirely, I kept running into barriers.\n\nFor the most part, I learned how to establish websites, develop ads, and master the marketing, but I simply wasn’t making any sales. I earned a few bucks here and there, enough to convince myself I was building a proper business, but it was so erratic and inconsistent that it hardly felt like I was constructing anything with real value.\n\nI learned how to reduce the steps I needed to take in order to begin making a profit, and this made all the difference. I identified a niche market for products I could easily acquire, which made it possible for me to concentrate on building the store and doing the marketing, all without the hassle of inventory, packing, or shipping. I was able to keep the expenses low and avoid any overly complex technology.\n\nI started an online store for easy-to-source, in-demand products. I set up my store and automated portions of my business using AI-powered tools. I could list all my products, set prices, and arrange store layout in just a couple of minutes. I felt like I was finally getting there.\n\nThe first sale was monumental and from there I was able to shift my focus to product marketing and optimizing my ads. Over time my sales started to increase consistently and I honed my skills in overall process optimization. I began my store with a small inventory of predominantly accessories and home décor and gradually added products after identifying market demand.\n\nThe journey was not easy, but my efforts paid off. I built a low-risk, low-cost business by focusing on products for which I could avoid manufacturing and storage. With everything in place, I was able to avoid technical distractions and focus on increasing my business scale.\n\nIf you’re over 35 and seeking solutions, I understand. I have gone through years of trial and error, and it is only recently that I have been able to where I want to be. But once I found my niche and acquired the appropriate tools to streamline the process, all the pieces started to fall into place. I now operate my online store full-time, earning more than I did during my 9-5, and have been able to create something that is profitable, sustainable, and in my control, which is a rewarding experience.",

No more spending Sunday nights planning next week’s promotions, no more generic “10% off everything” coupons that don’t work, no more trying to remember that Sarah always gets a latte and might want a muffin. The system learns what combinations drive sales, tests different offers automatically, and handles all the personalization without anyone lifting a finger. Set it up once, and it runs forever—turning every single receipt into a smart, personalized marketing tool while the owner focuses on actually running their business instead of being stuck in repetitive marketing tasks.",

There are now over 6,000 farts logged from 100 countries, and I’ve added a few new features: Pull My Finger (a random fart generator), Fart Confessions (where people anonymously share their funniest or most awkward fart stories)  \n  \nTotal earnings so far: $20.63 from affiliate clicks.

[Niche Job Boards](https://sitefy.co/product/remote-job-platform-saas-for-sale/)**  \n- **Revenue Streams** Job postings ($100–$500 each) AdSense ($500–$5k/month) sponsorships and premium memberships.  \n- **Effort Required** Heavy upfront work (6–12 months) then ~80% passive.  \n- **Avg Monthly Profit After Scaling** $3k–$20k across multiple boards.  \n\nI know *yawn*. But unlike crypto pumps or sketchy affiliate schemes job boards solve a real problem (employers need hires job seekers want opportunities) and scale predictably.  \n\n### **Why Most Passive Income Ideas Fail**  \n- **Freelancing** Active income disguised as passive.  \n- **Crypto/Stocks** More gambling than a business.  \n- **Print on Demand/Dropshipping** Saturated and reliant on constant marketing.  \n- **Affiliate Marketing** Requires relentless content creation or paid traffic.  \n\nJob boards aren’t sexy but they’re **recession resistant automate friendly and compound over time**. My biggest board now runs on 2–3 hours of maintenance per week.  \n\n### **Want to Try It Heres the Hard Truth**  \n- **Pick a Niche You Understand** (e.g. \"Remote DevOps Jobs\" beats \"General Tech Jobs\").  \n- **Expect 6–12 Months of Grind** before meaningful income.  \n- **Monetization Levers** Job listings (highest $) ads paid newsletters recruiter partnerships.  \n\n**Question for You** Whats your most reliable passive income stream? (And if its crypto no judgement I’ve been there.) Drop it in the comments!  \n\n*(No course to sell no hidden agenda just sharing what finally worked after a decade of trial and error.)*",

          "body": "You’re right to call out the hype. Most “passive” plays are either thinly veiled affiliate promos or labor-intensive side businesses that only feel passive after heavy upfront work. The forex replies here reinforce the problem: unlimited upside claims ignore risk, drawdowns, and the operational stress of active trading. And the linked survey and crypto pages are essentially low-yield churn or gambling, not durable income streams.\n\nA more pragmatic lens is to evaluate opportunities by four variables: ongoing maintenance load, reliable distribution, platform dependency risk, and capital intensity. Dividends from broad ETFs score well because ops load is low and distribution is built in. Modestly scoped SaaS with annual billing can be semi-passive if retention and support stay manageable. Evergreen content or IP that ranks for stable search intent can compound, provided you avoid platform whiplash. Real estate becomes semi-passive with competent property management, but capital and local risk matter.\n\nTakeaway: define “passive” as income decoupled from your time after a build phase, then choose one asset where you can win on distribution and retention, not hype. If you cannot clearly outline maintenance, acquisition, and platform risks in a one-page model, it is not passive.",

You try everything for few days or maybe 2 months and then you quit because you don’t see results, so how will you make money??\n\nMost of you have tried affiliate marketing, freelancing, CPA, etc. Guess what, you made $0. \n\nThe main reason is because you are either not taking action or you’re taking actions on the wrong things. For example, if you want to make money online with freelancing, you must know how to position yourself where the demand is and the skills/supply is limited. That’s how you make money on sites like Fiverr, upwork, etc.\n\nFor affiliate marketing, you can’t be promoting what everyone is promoting using free traffic and expect to make a dime, it doesn’t work that way. Promote a new product with paid traffic or with a strategic free traffic source like your own facebook group, YouTube channel, TikTok page, etc.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is your twist to the process that makes you money. For example recently I started promoting a browser and I made money online the first day. This is because the product is new and it is something people would be interested in.\n\nMy advice to anyone who is serious with making money online is that you should start by promoting value before you promote and offer. Only try free traffic if the product you’re promoting is Free.\n\nI’ll end my rant here!!\n\nAsk me questions if any.\n\n\nI come in peace.",

      "selftext": "So, quick backstory: I left my software dev job about 6 months ago. Sometimes feel like the worst decision of my life but whatever. I liked programming itself but hated everything around it. The meetings, the fake enthusiasm, the DSA grind every time you switch jobs, the feeling that nothing you build actually matters. I was an average dev and just couldn’t see myself doing the whole “leetcode 200 questions” cycle again, and that too for the REST OF MY MISERBALE LIFE. (Sorry if I offended any sw devs, but please bare with me, I just can't with this job anymore).\n\nAfter 3 years full-time I decided I’d had enough. Took a month off to reset and didn’t even open my laptop.\n\nThen I started thinking about what I actually enjoy. I’ve always loved puzzles. Sudoku, cryptograms, riddles, logic stuff, all thanks to my dad. He would come home from work and first thing he picked was the newspaper to solve crosswords.. He used to tell me, “You gotta move your brain as much as you move your body,” never really understood what it meant when I was child but now I see it.\n\nSo I built something around that. I made something that people like me will enjoy. A puzzle kit where you can solve puzzles and ultimately the mystery.\n\n# How it started\n\nGot together with 2 of my friends who were just as do-nothing as me. One's working on deciding the storyline, one on marketing and one on coding. The first release in June sold 5 copies. I almost quit right there, but instead decided to tweak everything. Reworked the puzzles, improved the design, rewrote some of the story, and re-released it. That version sold 454 copies. Not life-changing money, but 454 x $25 is a solid amount for a small team where we live.\n\nWe put everything we made back into the next version. We’ve just released version 3 about 10–12 days ago, and we’re already past 150 sales. I know it might sound small, but for three people who used to show up late to the office, miss deadlines, and constantly disappoint  families, even 2 sales felt like a win at one point.\n\n# What worked for us\n\n**1. Researching the market**  \nWe spent time reading forums and watching how people talk about puzzles. Found out that most puzzle lovers actually want a story or some sense of progression, not just random brain teasers. That’s how we came up with the idea of a connected mystery instead of a random puzzle pack.\n\n**2. Understanding the audience**  \nWe lurked in puzzle communities, ARG groups, and subreddits just to listen. Turns out, people didn’t want super hardcore escape-room puzzles. They wanted something relaxing but clever. That feedback changed our tone and visuals completely. We're constantly working on improving our storylines. \n\n**3. Studying competitors**  \nWe bought a few puzzle kits from bigger names and paid attention to what worked and what didn’t. A lot of them had either great puzzles with boring stories or great stories with lazy puzzles. We tried to strike a balance. But hey, they're doing something right!\n\n# Marketing (our toughest dragon to slay)\n\n**YouTube** – Tried posting short funny puzzle-related videos, but our channel got deleted because YT said we were “trying to take traffic off-platform.” That was a big loss because we actually saw a small bump from it before it went down ( I know, our fault, should've read the guidelines before, but who has time for that). Might create another one without actually trying to steal their audience.\n\n**Reddit** – Surprisingly helpful. Our first few posts here got a bit of traction and led to real customers. Had few lashbacks as well, cuz we were sounding too much like an ad. Think about the customers, before you think about the product.\n\n**Discord** – Still trying to figure it out. We made a small community but engagement is low (0). Probably need to give people more reasons to hang around beyond just solving puzzles. We're actively working on figuring out how to not just sell puzzles but actually create a community.\n\n**Twitter** – Haven't fully started. Still trying to figure this out.\n\n**Instagram / Meta ads** – This was the biggest driver of traffic. We ran small $10–$20/day ads and kept testing creatives. What worked best were short clips of the puzzles with captions like “Can you solve this?” followed by a mystery hook.\n\n**Hiring** – Hired winners from 2nd puzzle to work for us for promotion. They're learning, so are we. We have decided to hire more.\n\n# Where we’re at now\n\nWe’ve saved enough to last a few months and we’re using all business income for business expenses. The goal is to grow a small but loyal community instead of chasing quick sales.\n\nIt’s still early, and we have no idea if this will turn into something considerable, but it’s the first time in years we’ve actually been excited to wake up and work.\n\n3 \"devs\" , trying to figure out something other than being passed commands and then chatgpting the solution. Hoping we won't ever have to go back to office chairs, teams calls (I can still hear their audio in my head), waking up feeling scared if today will be the day I'll be thrown out. I mean, we are jobless right now as well, and we're not earning as much as we used too, but happiness matters right? Right ???",

          "body": "I would look into creating and scaling your own online business which can include affiliate marketing and selling digital products. The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training glfrom beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free! At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training glfrom beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free! At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

I’m more tech-oriented (computers, basic IT skills), and my wife has a background in sales. We both speak English fluently.\n\nSince we live in an apartment (no house, no garage, etc.), we’re trying to figure out what kind of side project or online work would actually make sense for us.\n\nHaving an online income still feels almost like science fiction — whenever I look into it, it seems like everything is already oversaturated. Dropshipping, for example, feels like it’s long past its prime.\n\nWe’ve thought about learning programming or website building, but the time investment seems huge, and honestly, it feels like every teenager or twenty-something already has a head start.\n\nThat said, we *are* willing to learn new skills — we just don’t know which ones are truly worth investing our time and effort in.\n\nWe don’t have a big budget (definitely not €50,000 to invest), but we’re motivated, disciplined, and ready to put in steady work.\n\nWhat would you recommend for people like us who want to start small, learn something valuable, and maybe build a modest but meaningful online income?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice or inspiration!",

Think of it as a journey a place to be creative, experiment, and be okay with failing fast so you can learn what doesn’t work.\n\nStart with your “why.” Why do you want to do this, and who do you want to help? Define your ideal customer, the lifestyle you want, and what your business should look like in 5–10 years. Then break that vision down into small, manageable steps you can take one at a time.\n\nAll businesses share the same core structure: marketing, sales, operations, and cash flow. Cash flow is what keeps you in the game without it, even the best idea fails. So you need to understand your margins, because that’s what drives profit and profit is what lets you grow and scale sustainably.\n\nThe key is to find a niche where you can stand out. Be better at something, improve something, or serve a specific type of customer in a unique way. Focus on building a brand because brands create trust, and trust allows you to charge more than your competitors. Without a brand, your only advantage is price, and that’s a race to the bottom.\n\nFinally, test everything. Start small, see what gets traction, and double down on what works. No one will tell you what’s working right now that’s the business world’s best-kept secret but everyone will tell you what used to work.",

It doesn't have the potential to scale to something huge like starting your own business, but those things can also just end up paying nothing.

You can search reddit and find huge lists of companies that hire for this and then look for what suits you best. You don't need to learn new skills.

          "body": "You are right to be wary of dropshipping and “overnight” plays. A realistic path for an apartment-friendly side income is to start with a narrow, outcome-based service that compounds into assets. Pick one customer profile where you already have familiarity, then offer a clear result such as “launch a fast WordPress store in 7 days with basic SEO and Stripe.” The WooCommerce plus Elementor stack is free to start, low friction, and gives you speed and control without deep coding.\n\nUse her sales strength to run short, targeted outreach to 30 prospects in that niche. Keep it human and specific: problem, outcome, timeline, price. Your tech role is delivery and iteration. Track three numbers from day one: response rate, conversion rate, and delivery hours. When you can repeat the same workflow reliably, turn the process into a productized package and a simple checklist, then add a small upsell like basic email capture or a one-page SEO refresh.\n\nIf you want a purely side income stream to bridge the early months, data annotation platforms can be a pragmatic filler, but they are not passive and quality varies. Treat them as temporary cash flow, not a core business.",

(See picture in the link for proof.) At first I wasn’t making as much but if you’re willing to invest a bit or time and money, you can easily get your money back fairly quickly. I broke even around 6 months. Now I can’t guarantee any specific time frame, just because there are so many factors, but it’s def possible. So how does it work? The investments you make are for actually physical real miners that the company holds in a number of warehouses (and you can even watch a live stream of the miners and can see whenever someone is working on them) and takes care of them. So investment literally buy you actual miners (but you won’t have to deal with any maintenance or electricity. We pay the company a small percentage of our earnings to cover all that. So you could literally sign up, buy your first miner, set it to reinvest in TH (more TH = More $), and just leave it in a closet and it will continue to make you money! Now it’s not going to be the quickest option, but the point is that your account just continues to get more and more profitable over time. Plus, they are just really a great company to work with!\n\nIf any of you are at all interested in signing up, please just DM me here or on Discord at: Smaug\\_LegendsOTM and I’ll help answer any questions/guidance you might have/need, including how to sign up and get the most benefits right off the top!

On a good month I can earn 2k, usually about 30/hr depending on the project and if I put my mind to it.\n\nIt started as a small side gig, but it made me realize I actually can make decent money online. Now I can’t stop thinking about whether I could turn this into something full-time or move into other kinds of online work like e-commerce, freelancing, or anything else that’s flexible.\n\nI’m not trying to chase easy money, I just feel like I’d learn more building things and experimenting than sitting through lectures that don’t connect to anything. Also, the corporate world sounds horrible for me and my mental health.\n\nFor anyone who’s dropped out, freelances full-time, or runs something online:\n\nHow did you figure out what to focus on? Did you wait until you were making enough to drop out, or just go for it?\n\nNot trying to promote anything here, just trying to figure out my next move.

You look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill.

No gambling involved, just some basic math and patience. You’ll need some starting cash (around €800 is okay), but once you get the hang of it, it can actually turn into a nice consistent income. And i say this to you cause I do this for because I have been doing this for almost 2 years and monthly I fluctuate between €4000 and €6000 per month but the relatively interesting thing is that it is a method of earning that is risk-free because mainly what you do is cover all the outcomes of that match obviously using other bookmakers so you have the security not only of not losing the money you have bet but of unlocking the bonus in real balance.",

I brushed it off because Pinterest seemed like a platform for recipes and home decor, not finance content.\n\nAfter 8 months my blog was still under 500 monthly visitors from Google. SEO is slow and competitive in finance niche.\n\nFinally tried Pinterest out of desperation. Created 20 pins, joined some Communities via Tailwind, posted consistently for 30 days.\n\nMonth 1 results:\n\n- 1,847 visitors from Pinterest\n- 89 email subscribers\n- 2 affiliate commissions\n\nPinterest traffic in one month exceeded 8 months of SEO traffic. I wasted 8 months ignoring my friend's advice because of assumptions about what Pinterest was for.\n\nNow at month 6:\n\n- 8.2K monthly Pinterest visitors\n- 450 email subscribers total\n- $340 monthly affiliate income\n\nPinterest is my main traffic source now. Google brings maybe 600 visitors monthly while Pinterest brings 8K+.\n\nThe lesson: Don't dismiss platforms based on stereotypes. Test them and see actual results.\n\nWish I'd started Pinterest when my friend first suggested it. Would be 6 months ahead now.\n\nWhat advice did you ignore that you later regretted?

How?\n* Are you using Telegram mainly for idea generation or for output polishing?\n* Does it actually stick as a daily routine?\n\nBy the way, some of these bots are built by me and some by friends in the community who shared their work with me.\n\nIf anyone wants the full list with links you can just comment below or DM me.\n\nHappy to share my work.",

Here's the 14-day update.\n\n**Quick Recap:**\n\n* Niche: Plant-based milk alternatives (oat, almond, soy, etc.)\n* Site: Interactive quiz → matches users with plant milk → Amazon affiliate links\n* Built with zero coding experience using Claude AI\n* Started Oct 9, now Day 20\n\n\n\n**What's Changed (Day 6 → Day 20):**\n\n**Content Strategy Shift:**\n\n* Pivoted HARD to SEO content\n* Published 8 blog posts in 14 days (2x/week cadence)\n* Topics: \"Best Plant Milk for Coffee,\" \"Protein,\" \"Weight Loss,\" \"Kids,\" \"Smoothies,\" \"Keto,\" \"Oat vs Almond,\" \"Is Soy Milk Healthy\"\n* All 2,000-2,500 words with proper Schema markup, internal linking, affiliate links\n* Added \"Latest from Blog\" section to homepage\n\n**Traffic Evolution:**\n\n* Week 1 (Reddit spike): 240 users\n* Week 2-3 (post-Reddit crash): \\~5-10 users/day (mostly direct)\n* Reddit experiment today: Posted golden milk recipe to r/veganrecipes (294 views, low engagement - learned I need photos for recipe posts)\n\n**Monetization:**\n\n* **$6.36 total earnings** (up from $1.69 two weeks ago! 🎉)\n* **8 items shipped** (up from 1)\n* **102 Amazon clicks** (up from 30 in first week)\n* **7.84% conversion rate** (clicks → orders shipped)\n* Funny reality: People bought a winter jacket, 5x ultrasonic mouse repellents, a car phone mount... but ZERO actual plant milk 😂\n* Amazon's 24-hour cookie captures anything they buy, not just what you link to\n\n**Tech Updates:**\n\n* Added blog index page with green \"NEW\" badge system for latest post\n* Internal linking between all 8 posts\n* Updated sitemap after each post\n* Cookie consent + Google Analytics properly configured\n* All posts have affiliate disclosure boxes\n* Added homepage blog preview section (shows latest 3 posts)\n\n**Reddit Experiments:**\n\n* Tried helpful comment in r/vegan niche question thread (genuine engagement)\n* Posted golden milk recipe to r/veganrecipes today (learned: NEED PHOTOS for recipe posts)\n* Being careful not to spam or over-promote\n* Focusing on being helpful first, promotional never\n\n\n\n**Current Stats (Day 20):**\n\n**Content:**\n\n* 8 blog posts live (2,000+ words each)\n* Strong internal linking structure\n* All with Schema markup + affiliate disclosures\n\n**Traffic:**\n\n* \\~400 total users (lifetime)\n* \\~5-10 users/day (organic baseline post-Reddit)\n* Still waiting on first Google impression (sitemap submitted 7 days ago)\n\n**Monetization:**\n\n* $6.36 earned\n* 102 Amazon clicks\n* 8 items shipped\n* 7.84% conversion rate (solid for affiliate!)\n\n**Investment:**\n\n* Time: \\~27 hours total (12 hours week 1, \\~15 hours weeks 2-3)\n* Money: Claude Pro $250/year + domain $12/year = $262 total\n* ROI so far: -$255.64 😅\n\n\n\n**What I've Learned:**\n\n**Content Production with AI:**\n\n* Claude AI is INSANE for content creation when you give it structure\n* My workflow: I write outlines, Claude writes full posts, I edit/approve\n* Can produce a 2,500-word blog post in \\~90 minutes\n* Quality is solid (readable, well-structured, properly cited with Amazon affiliate links)\n* Internal linking happens naturally when you prompt for it\n\n**SEO Reality Check:**\n\n* Google takes FOREVER (submitted sitemap 7 days ago, zero impressions yet)\n* Reddit traffic is a drug - spike feels great, crash hurts\n* Building content library while waiting for indexing\n* Playing the long game now (this is month 1 of a 12+ month play)\n\n**What Actually Matters:**\n\n* Quality internal linking (connects all 8 posts)\n* Consistent publishing schedule (2x/week is sustainable for me with full-time job + family)\n* Actually helpful content (not keyword-stuffed garbage)\n* Patience (everyone says 6-12 months to see real results)\n\n**The Weird Amazon Thing:**\n\n* People click plant milk links but buy random stuff\n* That 24-hour cookie is powerful - captures ANY purchase\n* 7.84% conversion is actually solid for affiliates\n* But you need TRAFFIC to make it work\n\n\n\n**Mistakes I Made:**\n\n1. **Relied too much on Reddit early** \\- not sustainable, just a vanity spike\n2. **Posted recipe without photo** \\- Reddit loves visuals, learned that today\n3. **Expected faster Google indexing** \\- reality = 2-4 weeks minimum\n4. **Didn't build email list** \\- should've started Day 1 (still haven't)\n5. **No returning visitor strategy** \\- everyone takes quiz once and bounces forever\n6. **Obsessed over analytics too much** \\- should focus on content instead\n\n\n\n**Next 14 Days (Day 20-34):**\n\n**Content:**\n\n* Publish 2-3 more posts (\"Best Plant Milk for Baking,\" \"Is Oat Milk Healthy,\" \"Cashew vs Almond\")\n* Target: 10-12 total posts by Day 34\n* Keep internal linking strong between all posts\n\n**SEO:**\n\n* Wait for Google indexing (should happen soon... right?)\n* Monitor Search Console obsessively for first impression\n* Optimize based on what ranks (if anything)\n\n**Traffic:**\n\n* Stop chasing Reddit spikes (not sustainable)\n* Focus on building organic foundation\n* Maybe experiment with Pinterest (visual platform, recipe-friendly)\n* Consider other subreddits for genuine engagement\n\n**Monetization:**\n\n* Add more affiliate opportunities in existing posts (protein powders, kitchen tools, etc.)\n* Consider email capture for newsletter (finally)\n* Track which posts drive clicks (protein? smoothies? coffee?)\n\n\n\n**Questions for the Community:**\n\n1. **How long did YOUR first Google impression take?** (I'm at 7 days post-sitemap submission, getting anxious)\n2. **Is 8 posts enough to start seeing traction?** Or should I hit 20-30 first?\n3. **Anyone else using Claude/AI for content?** What's your workflow? Quality concerns?\n4. **Tips for reducing bounce rate on quiz sites?** Everyone takes quiz once and leaves forever - how do I get them back?\n5. **That 7.84% conversion rate - is that actually good?** Or am I celebrating too early?\n\n\n\n**The Reality Check:**\n\nI'm in the \"valley of death\" right now:\n\n* Reddit spike is gone ✅\n* Google hasn't kicked in yet ❌\n* Traffic is \\~5-10/day 📉\n* Grinding out content hoping it pays off in 3-6 months ⏳\n* $6.36 earned vs $262 invested = -$255.64 in the hole 💸\n\nBut honestly? I'm learning a ton, the content quality is solid, and I'm building something that *should* work once Google starts sending traffic. The hard part is the waiting and not knowing if you're wasting your time.\n\nThe AI workflow is genuinely game-changing though - there's no way I could produce 8 quality blog posts in 2 weeks without Claude. That alone might be the most valuable thing I've learned.\n\n**Site:** [**noncow.com**](http://noncow.com) (8 blog posts live if you want to check quality)\n\nHappy to answer questions about the AI workflow, content strategy, Amazon weirdness, or the emotional rollercoaster of month 1! 😅",

      "selftext": "The idea came from someone that runs a disney holidays comparison platform. She makes about 3k a month from the website while working about 3-4 hours a month on it. Most of her traffic comes from SEO. The revenue model is mainly affiliate commissions.\n\nI heard about her succesfull project and thought well I can do that as well. I'll let AI do the website coding (no wordpress or CMS) and the content writing (using markdown format).\n\nThere are javascript libaries that allow you to load markdown as SEO optimized content on a web project. Lots of frontend developers have blogs that use this structure. Yet this structure is barely used in the affiliate marketing/SEO world.\n\nOf course I couldnt just copy her niche, that wouldnt be fair so I came up with a similiair yet different niche. A theme park the size of a disney theme park but a little less known.\n\nSomething to point out here is that her (and my) platform are not in English. This makes it a lot easier to rank due to less competition and lower content saturation in that language market.\n\n# Building the website\n\nMy first step was to create a rock-solid plan. I spent a few hours outlining a detailed, phased plan for the entire project. This document detailed the exact frontend folder structure, the required reusable components like headers and footers. (all done with the help of my friend Google Gemini). next step was to split the plan in different phases and let my AI assistants complete the development for each phase.\n\n# Content writing\n\nWhile the coding AI was churning out pages, I put another AI to work on the content. I gave it the topics and keywords, and it wrote all the descriptions for the accommodations close to the theme park, the SEO texts for the pages, and several blog posts, all formatted in Markdown. This content is loaded directly into the website (using mdx), no CMS needed.\n\nFrom the initial idea to a fully functional, content-rich website deployed on Vercel for free, the entire process took just under two weeks.\n\nI'm currently letting Google index my project and have more content to be published in my pipeline. Will give an update in a few months.\n\n ",

      "selftext": "With AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews taking over search behavior, brands must shift from ranking in Google to being cited in AI answers. This new discipline, called Answer Engine Optimization (AEO), focuses on getting your brand mentioned in AI outputs that buyers trust.\n\nTo succeed, you must first pick the prompts you want to own - queries that are core to your brand, competitive “knife-fights,” and experimental opportunities. Different AI platforms behave differently, so focus on the one your audience uses most before expanding. Winning citations requires hyper-specific, niche-focused content, structured comparisons, and lists that AI can easily parse.\n\n***What to do***\n\n* Identify and prioritize the prompts most valuable to your brand.\n* Focus on your primary AI platform before expanding to others.\n* Create hyper-specific, structured, and comparison-rich content.\n* Build external citations from trusted platforms and niche creators.\n* Actively engage in relevant Reddit threads (brand or anonymously).\n* Replace key images with tables and add detailed alt text where needed.\n* Track brand share-of-voice in AI answers, not just web traffic.\n* Review and update your AEO strategy weekly to keep up with citation changes.\n\n  \nDid I miss something?\n\n^(That's all for today)  :)  \n^(Follow me if you find this type of content useful.)  \n^(I pick only the best every day!)",

      "selftext": "My barber does a great job cutting hair, but like most barbershops, the prices are a bit steep these days ($30+, plus tip).\n\nPersonally, my hair grows very fast, so if I wanted to keep it clean, I would easily have to get my haircut at least once every two weeks or so. It also doesn't help that I don't have the greatest neckline (i.e. it looks messy once my hair starts to grow out). However, paying that much money just wasn't something I was willing to do so I would wait longer than I wanted to between cuts.\n\nMy barber mentioned to me that business wasn't doing well. This wasn't a surprise to me because his shop was rarely busy.\n\nI have no barbershop experience but I do enjoy thinking of ways to make businesses more efficient and profitable.\n\nI suggested that he try this: offer basic (not bad) haircuts that he could do quickly &amp; efficiently, for a lower price. This would mean no skin fades and no use of scissors (I know this might sound crazy but a previous barber of mine only used clippers and it worked completely fine for my shorter hairstyle. He had longer clipper attachment guards so this isn't a matter of everyone getting a short buzzcut) because that also rules out longer hairstyles, etc.\n\nThere is a market out there for people like myself who are wanting basic haircuts and would get haircuts more frequently if the price was lower.\n\nHe took my advice and he has never been busier. There is almost always someone waiting in line for a haircut, and he has even implemented a numbering system. He charges $22 with no tip option. Although the price is lower, his chair almost always has someone in it and he gets through his haircuts much faster.\n\nSomething I want to stress again is that these are not bad haircuts. These are just simple (compared to some other haircuts out there) haircuts. Yes, I know cutting your hair at home is an option but that is irrelevant to this. There are many reason why someone may not want to cut their own hair, and also, some people do skin fades on themselves so a basic haircut does not automatically mean that someone can do it themselves.",

But if you expect your spouse to stay at home at any point in your relationship then your prenup has to account for that otherwise it is unfair. The problem with \"traditional marriages\"(not saying you want one) is that one individual in the marriage sacrifices everything. Leaving them extremely vulnerable if a divorce were to occur. Which why splitting of assets is a thing. But if someone were to have a traditional marriage and a restrictive prenup I honestly would expect a court to throw it out during divorce proceedings. ",

Especially short form and reels etc.\n\nThe success of these strategies are heavily dependent on your industry and your model. How you design and implement these strategies too.\n\nThe big mistake I see brands making is to think they should be everywhere all at once. This really stems from not knowing your client and listening to external motivators(like agencies and content creators etc)\n\nI see brands jump on trends or jump on things like founder marketing, podcast etc. without thinking it through and really, and I mean REALly understanding the entire spend involved. We end up wasting a massive amount of time and resources to add to the noise for what we perceive to be marketing.\n\nMy business for instance, i have shut down all social channels do no founder marketing or any of this stuff that gets touted on the channels.\n\nMy website is my single source of truth. I use whatsapp for updates of our work and comms to warm leads and existing and ex clients, friends and family with a simple opt out thumbs down. Not automated. And email, same thing. Then we host our content privately tailored around specific archetypes and give them access upon request.\n\nThis is obviously specific to my business. The b2b and positive impact space. \n\nWhen it comes to your business, you need to figure out what works for you. What is sustainable for you. What is aligned with your values as a person and as a company. Because the reality is that anything that doesnt, generates friction which leads do dead ends and wasted resources when you eventually abandon this.\n\nBusinesses and people are very alike. Each has a personality, boundaries, history, context etc. if you do something because it’s who you are, you will attract more of what you put out. If you put out what you are not aligned with, you will get more of what you are not aligned with.\n\nDouble down on what you do or your business does well. \n\nDo less, more.",

          "body": "This is why a startup coach is essential for solo founders. It’s good for any startup founder, but effectively required for a solopreneur because there’s frequently no one else in the founder’s life who understands the unique emotional roller coaster that exists in the march to PMF \n\nAlso, look for CEO-specific startup events in your area. Sadly, most tech meetups are shit, but if you can find one that is specifically focused on CEOs (meaning no service providers looking for sales or ICs looking to get hired), you’ll quickly find that there are MANY people doing the same work as you and experiencing the same wild ups and downs. \n\nLastly, even if you can’t talk to them about your work, you have to maintain relationships with other people. You need a friend group. There’s an old recovery phrase that “connection is the opposite of addiction”. We are social creatures. We need human interaction. Find a men’s group. Stay connected with friends and play videogames (in person!) or grab dinner or anything to spend time building great memories with other people. \n\nOtherwise, even if you become hugely successful, you’ll still be lonely and depressed. \n\nEdit: spelling ",

We’ll hit a year in business at the end of this month and have already done ~$2M in revenue with 26% net profit margins. Long story short, I was looking for investors to help us grow at the same rate or faster. I found a great partnership and now I’m the “CEO” of my own company. \n\nThis is a complete first world problem, but how do you get over imposture syndrome? I know I’ve worked hard to get here, but it’s something I never dreamed of happening. ",

          "body": "Hitting **$2M** in your first year with **26% net margins** and earning investor confidence is not accidental. The title change just exposes a new surface area of decisions. Imposter feelings usually fade when you replace vague pressure with precise operating rhythms. Define your weekly leadership cadence around a few leading indicators that you personally own: qualified pipeline added, customer retention by cohort, payback period on acquisition, and cash runway movement. Keep a short decision journal so you can revisit how you framed choices and what you learned. Build a simple narrative report for your partners each month that ties outcomes to bets, risks, and next actions. That practice compounds credibility with yourself first.\n\nAt the team level, clarify two or three CEO responsibilities that only you can do: set focus, allocate capital, and hire or fire standards. Everything else is delegated with clear success criteria. When impostor thoughts pop up, audit your inputs rather than your identity. Are your customer conversations frequent and structured? Are you segmenting profitability and killing weak lines quickly? Are you running postmortems on misses and publicly adopting the fix?\n\nYou do not need to feel like a CEO to operate like one. Put a simple system in place, let results update the story, and let the title catch up later.",

Focus on the process, taking the steps that need to be made to achieve the goal you set. Its tough to get over imposter syndrome but as you take the steps, you realise that you can do the thing. What makes it harder is that once you get the hang of it, you start to wonder if you are doing it right because it seems easy and relatable, like you get how it works. The problem comes from the fact that you got to that aha moment with what you know which may be very little or different compared to the experts you listen to or hear about or read about. But that's life. Follow the manual and you will always have that Ikea furniture which in your case is a profitable company!\n\n  \nCongrats!",

      "selftext": "Okay so this is kinda wild. I've been messing around with n8n for like 3-4 months now, mostly just building random shit for myself because I'm a nerd and it's fun.\n\nLast month I'm sitting in Starbucks (yeah yeah I know) trying to look productive, and this real estate lady next to me is VENTING to her friend about how she keeps missing leads. Like she's legitimately stressed about it. Something about Zillow inquiries coming in at weird hours and by the time she sees them the next day, people have already connected with other agents.\n\nNow normally I mind my own business but I'd literally just watched a tutorial on webhook automations the night before so I'm like... I could fix that? So I do the awkward lean-over thing and I'm like \"sorry I couldn't help overhearing but I actually build automation stuff, I might be able to help?\"\n\nShe looked at me like I was trying to sell her a timeshare lmao but she gave me her business card anyway.\n\nWhat I actually built her: Basic webhook setup to catch form submissions from her website. Auto-reply email that goes out in like a minute saying \"thanks I got your message, I'll hit you back soon\". Everything dumps into a Google Sheet so she can see all her leads in one place. Her phone gets an SMS whenever a new lead comes in (she LOVED this part). If she doesn't check off that she contacted them within 24hrs, they get an automatic follow-up.\n\nHonest to god it took me maybe 6 hours? And half of that was me googling \"how to format SMS in n8n\" and troubleshooting why the webhook kept timing out , seems i had wrong webhook.\n\nI charged her $450 because I literally had no idea what to charge and that felt like a big number but not TOO big ya know?\n\nPlot twist: Two weeks later she calls me HYPED. Apparently a lead came through at like 11pm on a Saturday night - she was already in bed but got the text, sent a quick reply from her phone, and ended up closing the deal. The commission? Twelve. Thousand. Dollars.\n\nShe literally said \"you just paid for yourself like 25 times over\" and then referred me to two other agents in her office.\n\nIf you're thinking about doing this: Dude just start. Real estate agents need basic stuff, not rocket science. Maybe do a cheap/free first project to get a testimonial and build confidence. These people have actual budgets if you save them time. You don't need to be some automation god, you just gotta solve an actual problem they have.\n\nAnyway I'm rambling but I'm just hyped because this actually worked. Happy to answer questions if anyone wants to try this!",

That $450 one-time fee should become $150/mo (or tiered by number of lead sources they connect).\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Expand vertically fast\\*\\*: Service businesses with \"speed-to-respond\" problems are everywhere - HVAC contractors, plumbers, electricians, car detailing, cleaning services. Google Local Service Ads rewards fastest responders. Same problem, same solution.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Don't just build for one person\\*\\*: Once you have 2-3 case studies in the same vertical, that's your entry point to sell into their networks/associations.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Key growth levers:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Real estate agents have referral networks. One happy agent = 20 referrals in their office\n\n\\- Service contractors all talk to each other at supply shops, trade events\n\n\\- Industry-specific Facebook groups are goldmines for warm outreach\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The catch:\\*\\* If you stay at $450 per client doing custom work, you cap out. The winning path is building 1-2 standardized solutions, documenting the setup process, then selling it at $99-299/month with light support.\n\n\n\nYou've proven the concept. Now systematize it.

I am not just talking about loved ones (those are important); I am talking about other entrepreneurs and business people. Entrepreneurship can be a lonely journey some times, and during those periods, you want to be able to reach out to other people who will understand what you are going through. Better yet, they can give you feedback and let you know if your business has room for growth\n\n3. Whether you are building a product or offering a service, always try to focus on small metrics rather than drastic ones. For instance, if you are doing an outreach campaign, a mistake I see is founders focusing on number of calls booked. Instead, start small and focus on number of email opens and try to improve that. Once you feel that has been improved enough, work on the email's copy and start measuring number of link clicks. If you keep working on these smaller elements, the bigger picture will take care of itself.\n\nThe bottom line is that entrepreneurship is all about grit. That matters more than intelligence and more than having a great idea.",

I tried CPA, affiliate marketing, freelancing you name it. None of it clicked for me. The only things that brought in a little cash were surveys and game offers, and even then, the pay wasn’t great.\n\nI’ve been jumping from one thing to another, just hoping to find something that actually works for me. I really don’t have the time or energy to throw into something that eats up my whole day. Things are rough, I can barely afford food or basics. No matter how hard I try, I keep hitting dead ends.\n\nI even decided to focus on something I actually care about, just to see if it felt better. So, I built a Chrome extension that helps people where their researches. A few people used it, it even got featured , but honestly, it didn’t go anywhere. I’m not expecting to blow up with thousands of users, but it’s tough not to feel like I wasted all that time. It took me 4-5 months to finish that extension while seeking help on Discord Servers.\n\nI feel like a failure sometimes, especially when I look at how much time I’ve put in for almost nothing. I can’t even cover my basic needs, and finding a job feels impossible and I've applied to over a hundred jobs and nothing’s landed. I’m not asking to get rich, just want to be able to handle my own stuff without stressing about every little thing.\n\nI’m actually pretty good at computer repairs, so I tried offering my services on platforms like Fiverr, but my gig barely got any attention. Then I switched to cryp-to, and wow, so many scammers out there just trying to take your money with zero intention of helping. Funny enough, the only thing that made me any real money was gambling. I made about a hundred bucks, but I had to quit before it I become addicted. Seriously, don’t mess with gambling, so it’s not worth it.\n\nSome nights I can’t even sleep because my mind just keeps running in circles about all this stuff. I’m burned out, anxious, and it feels like I’m never going to hit my goal.\n\nI can accept failures, but I just need to find something sustainable that I can visualize it in a way that will be guaranteed.\n\nSorry for the long rant.

It’s not glamorous, but it stops you panicking every day.\n2. Turn your repair skills into real gigs: drop flyers in student halls, post on campus noticeboards or local Facebook groups and charge a small call-out fee.\n3. Treat your side projects like experiments. Every week set one clear goal (fix two PCs, get five users on your extension), note what worked and what didn’t.\n\nThose little wins build up fast and suddenly you’ve got momentum without burning out chasing the next big thing.",

I don't know many kids who started working at 14 these days.\n\nFirstly, jumping around means you're not staying long enough to build up a name and a reputation.  So you need to decide on something and stick to it.\n\nYou need to test your idea with the market. If they're not buying it, it doesn't mean the idea is wrong. It may just be the angle, or they haven't built trust in you yet. \n\nYou built an amazing Chrome extension. That is a great thing. The problem is that you poured all your time and energy into something  there is no demand for.\n\nFor now, I would suggest finding a job, any job, even if it's menial labour, so that you can pay your bills. This will give you time to work online without jumping around so you can get clear on what suits you best.\n\nDo what you enjoy because it will drain the life out of you if you don't,  and it will help you stay excited and motivated. \n\nYou mentioned computer repairs. You can do something with that. Start a YouTube channel showing people how to do that, or offer it at home as a service to your community, or both. \n\nBased on what you've shared, you probably have ADHD, which means you're thinking 10 steps ahead.

But if you want to \"train\" to become an entrepreneur one day, you have to learn how to sell [3].\nIf you don't have a technical background to build stuff, look for a role in sales at a company ideally technology because it's lucrative, fast paced and you'll get exposure to build your social capital. If it's not an option retail can help to start building your sales skills. Not only will this give you the real skill set you'll realistically need as a business owner, but it can give you some cash and capital to give you some breathing room. \n\nGetting a job:\n\nWhy do people hire employees? Because their trying to delegate and scale their business through human labour. \n\nWhat does a business do? It generates value for customers by solving their problems in exchange for money. Instead of making a hamburger yourself you go to MacDonalds because it's a system that focuses on solving a problem: fast, affordable, convenient, consistent quality. \n\nHow can you stand out in \"applying for a job\"? Think like a contrarian and get creative (also a good skillset of an entrepreneur).\n\nQ: If 40K people are applying through the same job posting, how can you differentiate yourself? \n\nA: By not playing the same game everyone else is playing.\n\nInstead find a way to get into direct contact with the decision maker of the hiring (usually hiring manager) and demonstrate your value, how you can solve their problems (making widgets, selling widgets or increasing performance of the former or latter). \n\nThis can be sending a cold email to the person introducing yourself and providing some value which requires diligence, research and work [3].\n\ne.g., \nHi Hiring Manager XYZ,\n\nI noticed you're hiring for position Account Executive, based on some analysis of your competitor ABC's products, I think DEF has the superior QRT because H, J, and K reasons.\n\nI was curious so I did some poking around and had some ideas of potential prospects that might generate some deals moving forward:\n\n1. Name at Company A - Title\n2. Name at Company B - Title\n3. Name at Company C - Title\n\nI think #3 has decision making authority and Company C has recently raised its Series B round and is in need of &lt;DEF product&gt;.\n\nAny interest in getting on a call to discuss?\n\nMy cell: ...; or feel free to send me a Calendly link.\n\nI'm not an expert but maybe that gives some food for thought.\n\n---\n\n[1] The problem with your approach thus far, at least as I read it, is your taking the \"spread fire shot approach\" - this can work if it's in your free time, but if you're burning real cash -- you have to focus on the *problems* you want to solve for other people instead of random widgets and gadgets. Businesses exist to help people solve their problems (See \"Jobs to Be Done Theory\") - most of the time at your age, you just don't have enough real world experience to know what a mid-level manager at a technology company (who is your product's prospect) needs and struggles with, instead you spin your wheels building B2C products (really hard). \n[2] Robert Kiyosaki's path to becoming a business owner and investor was this way too. \n[3] Sales today is not the same as 20 years ago, it's not the sleazy car salesman instead it's taking the role of a trusted advisor - see Dale Carnegie's Sell!",

Since you already built a Chrome extension and have tech skills, have you considered creating simple quiz funnels for local businesses? They're surprisingly effective for lead generation and you could charge $300-500 per quiz setup.\n\nYour computer repair skills could actually be your foot in the door - offer to help local businesses with their tech issues, then mention how a \"Which service do you need?\" quiz on their website could help them get more qualified leads. Tools like Interact make it pretty straightforward to build these without heavy coding.\n\nThe key is starting local where you can build relationships face-to-face rather than competing with millions online.",

Any interest in trades? If you like computer repairs, perhaps getting into an electrician trade school might be a good option? \nTLDR: I have the same head as you where I lose sleep at times overthinking everything I could be doing to make more money. I was dead broke (in CC debt) working in restaurants until about 24/25, then Covid hit and I applied to every job possible and ended up in finance (finance/econ major in college). I now make 6 figures, married, own a home, but still ask a lot of what if’s. I was always creative and think I would have killed it if I just followed my creative passions, but alcohol in the restaurant industry got in the way and I pursued booze, herb, and women. Thankfully I’m doing well now, but like I said, I still look back and forward, constantly thinking what more I can do with my skills and interests. \nCurrently exploring no-code app building but it does require $ investments.. the less technical you are the more expensive it is too, and I am not very technical and don’t have time to learn that shit with a full time job, a wife, home and a kid on the way. So here I am. \nAnyway, if you ever wanna talk ideas, strategy, etc, from someone who has failed and picked themselves back up but still yearns for more, let me know. Best of luck!",

This is the problem I've seen time and time again, Honestly it's very similar to people wanting \"romantic love\". **We often idealize what finding the right person is, or finding the right business or venture**. The reality is that every venture or \"vehicle\" can work, why? Because right now there's someone pursuing that venture and succeeding. You've mentioned many ventures you pursued, and I imagine you've gone to a point where you've hit the wall of frustration, or the valley of despair, Where you realize said venture isn't what it was cracked up to be. the funny thing is every single venture has bottlenecks, trade offs, And limitations you need to solve for. (But every time you jump ship, you're starting over!) Knowing all I know about psychology and reward systems, I think what you really want is \"A venture that yields a reward fast enough To make me feel Like **I've got it, this is the one**\" and if you get a small win early on, Then that often pushes you to want to keep pursuing said task, goal or venture. This is why it's so helpful to account for your skill set. And pick a venture that has the most crossover to utilize said skill set, **so you're not starting over from zero**! Trust me brother I know it's a struggle, **BUT** it become significantly less of a struggle, when you pick a path/ venture, Burn the boats, And commit to sinking four to five years of your life into it. At the end of that road you'll at the very least have a monstrous skill set to show for it. And in turn you just keep **getting better**! and if you just keep getting better, eventually \"better\" will yield something. Good luck my friend!",

Met a mentor on TikTok joined his discord met people just like me hungry to make it out , some bs happened with the mentor that me and some of the students in there decided to leave and make our own free discord and brought some people with us, we all been in this journey now for a year , one of the homies now he’s 24 just like me closed a $30k trade off gold that took him like 1 hr to make another friend of ours , she’s a mom lol , but her dedication to learn this is as much as all of us last week aswell she made $12k off a trade aswell , including myself , after a year of locking back in I finally broke the cycle and everything clicked I took my first ever payout of $1,800 off a prop firm called topstep , my birthday is in may and I’m on a mission to have $25k in Cash by then , I tell you this bc I can tell your hungry for more and if you are up for the late night , studying , starring at candle sticks , learn to trade , yes 90% of people fail but that’s bc they don’t have fully control of there emotion / psychology, and that’s #1 before you see any results \n\nIf you up for the challenge and want it as bad as you want to breathe here’s a good start , on YT search up “tjr bootcamp” \n\nYou may see that people talk sh*t about this guy but he’s 23 with a freaking koenigsegg AT23!!! If your bashing on him that just speaks about yourself and your mindset bc some people just hate on him while others like me see it as motivation to get out of this rat race, \n\nAnyways , his boot camps videos are beginner friendly and i recommend him to almost anyone who has no clue about trading. \nIt’s not impossible, you just got to want it as bad as you want to breathe , Goodluck if you do decide to take this path , don’t tell anyone not even your parents or closest friend that you want to trade bc off the rip they’ll tell you “ it’s gambling” but as a someone who’s spent every dollar on this combines accounts to pass and get funded  so I can actually make money and finally seeing my growth , I’m telling you F**k what anyone else thinks, you’re young rn your able to take more risk compared to a 30 year old \n\nI tell you this bc in our homie discord we got people that are 19 , 20 , 21 all of us starting to print money and we can see the change happening in front of our eyes , but I promise you this , every single person making money in trading has gone thru hell learning this skill set IT IS NOT EASY BUT IT SURELY ISNT IMPOSSIBLE",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been a long-time lurker in communities like this and noticed something interesting. We talk a lot about SaaS, e-commerce, drop-shipping, and agencies. But a business model that has been my entire career for the last decade is almost never mentioned: **Comparison Websites.**\n\nI started as an employee at a large comparison site company, then launched my own successful one, and now I consult for others. I wanted to share a bit about this world because I genuinely believe it's one of the most solid online business models out there for solo founders or small teams.\n\nFull disclosure: this isn't \"easy money\" or a get-rich-quick scheme. It takes real work upfront. But if you crack the code, it's an incredibly rewarding and scalable business.\n\n**So, what the hell is a comparison site?**\n\nAt its core, you're a digital expert who helps people make better purchasing decisions.\n\nThink about any time you've had to buy something complex:\n\n* \"What's the best project management software for a small team?\"\n* \"Which VPN is the fastest for streaming?\"\n* \"What's the cheapest pet insurance for a bulldog?\"\n\nA good comparison site answers these questions clearly and objectively. You become the trusted advisor.\n\n**The Business Model in a Nutshell**\n\nIt’s a simple flywheel:\n\n1. **Pick a Playground (Niche):** You choose a specific category to become an expert in. This can be anything from software and finance to home goods or online courses.\n2. **Build Your \"Store\" (The Website):** This is your digital real estate. It's where you publish reviews, comparisons, and \"best of\" lists. The goal is to be genuinely helpful.\n3. **Get People in the Door (Traffic):** You attract people who are actively looking for answers, using creative traffic channels - SEO, PPC, social media (Facebook, Instagram, X, Reddit, and more). Some of these audiences come with strong purchase intent, while others require nurturing through content and trust before they convert.\n4. **Get Paid (Monetization):** When a visitor reads your content and decides to buy, they click a link on your site. That link takes them to the company's website (e.g., the software company, the insurance provider). You then get paid a commission for sending them that customer. This is usually done via affiliate marketing.\n\nThat's it. You are essentially a matchmaker between confused buyers and good companies.\n\n**Why is this a great model for founders?**\n\n* **You don't create a product.** No manufacturing, no coding a complex app.\n* **You don't handle inventory or customer service.** Your job ends when the user clicks your link.\n* **It's a sellable asset.** A profitable site is a digital property that can be sold for a significant multiple of its monthly profit.\n* **It can become semi-passive.** Once a page ranks well on Google, it can earn you money for months or years with minimal maintenance.\n\n**Now, for the reality check. What are the challenges?**\n\nThe biggest hurdle is patience. Sometimes things do click fast - a certain page takes off, a niche gets traction early, or traffic suddenly spikes. But more often, it takes experimentation and persistence: publishing more content, testing new angles, and trying different channels until you figure out what really works for your niche. You have to be willing to put in the work upfront without guaranteed results, and stay adaptable as you learn what moves the needle. Secondly, competition is real. Some niches are dominated by huge players, so you have to be strategic and find a unique angle or sub-niche to get your foot in the door. Finally, your content *must* be high quality. In a world of AI-generated noise, building trust and providing genuine value is the only way to win long-term.\n\nAgain, it takes time to build authority and traffic. But you're building a real, defensible asset.\n\nI just wanted to put this model on your radar because I haven't seen it discussed. Happy to answer any general questions about how the industry works.\n\nWhat do you all think? Has anyone else ever considered this path?\n\n",

This is not a promotional comment, rather I am a builder trying to validate a genuine idea that I believe could help some of the founders out there. I am building an AI tool, basically an AI accountability partner. The most failure stories of founders and builders that I have heard about is getting initial validation and then the product failing in the market. So I thought of building an anti-empathetic AI tool that will ask critical questions at your decisions and reminds you brutally about the goals you set and how much you achieve. I am thinking of using multi AI agents orchestrations to swarm a group of personal advisory AI agents to do the work and this might cost a bit more than usual chatbots like AI, so I have to validate this idea and I think this is the best place to make that validation.\n\nSo founders, what do you think?",

However, a series of apps to address things have been integrated in the prior two.  The trouble with initial technology innovation is the average employee now works with 10 apps, never mind moving between them.\n\nNow, I suggest a primary stack with a lot things apps integrated usually described as a revenue operating system (RevOps). That said get a RevOps with a human centric AI to automate so many things in different roles.  For example, today's average salesperson spends 30% of their time selling.  The other things they do are not productive, revenue generating, and really not their job.  So align an AI to a sales person to handle meeting notes, if on the road record what happened during the trip, produce account and monthly sales reports, and more. The sales roles is one example, the same premise can be used for many other roles.  So instead laying off everybody, optimize your #1 asset or people with AI enable RevOps (reducing 10 apps a day to one central stack).",

          "body": "I read your post and started considering this.\nFrankly, there are no one-size-fits-all rules here. Sometimes what users actually want becomes your worst nightmare. Sometimes what nobody wants at all becomes the best seller.\n\n\nI think it boils down to this: great products packaged wrong don't sell. Bad products well packaged do sell.\n\n\nSo the real question isn't whether you did your homework or missed the point. The real question is how determined and patient can you be, and what's the motivation behind it.\n\n\nSome launches fail because the time to launch was swallowed by an urgent need for cash, and users can smell it. Sometimes users buy from who they know. Sometimes they prefer buying from complete strangers.\n\n\nThough there are plenty of rules out there trying to make this journey a quick one-go track, it's not always true.\n\n\nSometimes everyone does the same exact thing and they all succeed. Then you start doing the 21st exact thing and you fail. Then someone does the 22nd exact same thing and succeeds.\n\n\nSometimes you play absolutely honest cards and everyone thinks you're there to scam them. And sometimes the real scammers are welcomed by the same people who rejected you.\n\n\nSometimes that's just the way it goes.\n\n\nI've found that regardless of how much you invest whetger it be both in time and money, if it's not your time to shine, you try in vain.\n\n\nOne of the most painful lessons of life as an entrepreneur is being forced to put gain before legacy. And often this hurts more than anything else.\n\n\nThe real question of entrepreneurship is to look 200 years down the road at what will last after you, not just the quick paycheck or MRR.\n\n\nIt's true that this can be challenging, but the first question is: why are you building what you're building? And has the time ripened for you yet?\n\n\nFor some people it takes 30 days, some 60 weeks, and some 100 months.\n\n\nThere's no golden one-size-fits-all except this: make sure you wisely define where you're going before you start. This will take you a much longer way toward reward.\n\n\nIn a society where everything must be done fast and now, you can get caught up doing things to the point of burnout, and later find you're all sucked dry because your vision was focused on pleasing the ever-changing whims of consumer trends rather than impacting someone's life.\n\n\nIt's not the easiest journey, but it's the most rewarding when you've predetermined where you want to go and press forward to get there.",

These days you can easily use AI tools like Frizerly or Pulse to actually generate the strategy and blogs to post regularly if you define your target customer and solution carefully.

Trying to appeal to everyone means you're generic as hell and nobody connects with it. Pick a specific person with a specific problem and talk directly to them.\n\nThe other big one is most businesses discover their marketing isn't working way too late. They run campaigns for months assuming people are seeing their stuff, then find out their emails were landing in spam the whole time or their ads were targeting the wrong audience. By the time they figure it out, they've burned through their budget.\n\nMarketing isn't just about having good copy or a clear target audience, it's about making damn sure your message actually reaches people. Doesn't matter how perfect your targeting is if your emails go to spam or your ads never get approved.\n\nFocus on distribution first, product second.

So I just built it.\n\nWhat it does\n\nAnswers calls 24/7, books appointments, answers the basic stuff like office hours and insurance questions, and passes the complicated calls to real people. That's it. Nothing fancy.\n\nStack is super simple - ElevenLabs API for the voice (seriously their voices are insanely good now), n8n to connect everything together, and it hooks into their calendar system.\n\nWhat actually worked\n\nStarted with literally one clinic. Didn't even charge them much at first, just wanted to see if it actually worked in the real world. Spent like a full day just sitting at their front desk watching what they do.\n\nThe voice thing is weirdly important. My first version sounded like a corporate robot and people hated it. Made it sound more friendly and casual and suddenly everyone was fine with it.\n\nYou HAVE to let people bail to a human. I added a \"press 0 anytime\" thing and it made all the difference. Some people just aren't gonna talk to a bot and that's cool.\n\nHonestly the biggest lesson was don't try to make it do everything. It handles the boring repetitive calls and that's enough. The staff handles the rest.\n\nWhere I'm at now\n\nStarted in August with that one clinic, now I've got 4. Charging like $500-800 to set it up then $200-400 a month depending on call volume. Making around $1400/month right now which isn't crazy but it's growing.\n\nBest moment was when one of the office managers told me her team can actually eat lunch now without stressing about phones. Made the whole thing feel worth it honestly.\n\nNot gonna lie my first launch was a disaster lmao. It double booked a bunch of appointments because I messed up the calendar integration. But you figure it out.\n\nIf you wanna try this\n\nJust find one local business with a phone problem. Dentists, hair salons, lawyers, whatever. Build something simple that solves ONE annoying thing they deal with every day.\n\nDon't overthink it. My whole setup runs on like $50/month in costs and took me maybe 2 weeks to build the first version.\n\nAnyway hope this helps someone. Happy to answer stuff if you have questions\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all nice comments and ton of upvotes i really appreciate it.",

The fact that you started by watching the front desk in person says it all; building something useful always starts with empathy, not tech hype.\n\nRespect for keeping it simple and focusing on fit, not perfection. That “press 0 for a human” move is classic shows you actually get user needs instead of forcing full automation. The pricing and rollout are solid too. This is how actual businesses get built with AI, not just by chasing trendy prompts.\n\nAppreciate you sharing the “messy launch” failures, too. That’s what most people never admit. Rooting for your growth, would love to hear more about which features matter most as you get more clinics (and how you keep things smooth as volume grows)!",

At first it feels amazing, you’re free, no one’s breathing down your neck, but then that freedom turns into this weird pressure because *everything* depends on you. No structure, no deadlines, no one to tell you what’s “enough.” What helped me was creating fake structure, setting my own work hours, planning my day the night before, even making small rules like “no phone until I finish this task.” It sounds boring, but it keeps you grounded.

Our expenses are low so the profits were fruitful. \n\nI have pivoted my business to focus on retainers as it brings in predictable cash flow. We are at about $10k per month. Then we get cash injections from short term branding projects. \n\nAll I can say is to continue to show us everyday and you will see the change slowly.

But honestly, the hardest lessons I’ve learned have been about mindset, relationships, and mental stamina.\n\nSome personal truths fr:\n\n* *Loneliness*: No matter how many mentors or podcasts you binge, there are months where it feels like nobody truly gets what you’re building.\n* *Uncertainty*: You wake up believing, go to bed doubting. There’s no external validation for a long, long time.\n* *Small wins matter*: It’s not always the “big launch” that keeps you going, but the tiny unexpected email, the positive feedback, the day you solve a bug that’s been crushing you.\n* *Sacrifice*: Friendships change, schedules implode. Most people only see the highlights, not the isolation or self-doubt.\n\nI’m curious:(being a SaaS Founder myself)\n\n* What’s one unfiltered reality you wish you’d known before starting?\n* How do you handle the emotional rollercoaster during the silent phases... when there’s no traction yet and momentum feels slow?\n* Any routines, mindsets, or support systems that keep you grounded through the ups and downs?\n\nLet’s swap real stories and support, especially for newer founders who need to hear that the gritty parts are normal, and often the most important.",

But during those silent months with zero traction, I realised no one else will believe in it as much as you need to. That belief has to come from within, and it's exausting to maintain alone.

Once your mindset and reality shifts from \"get a job, get paid by a fixed wage, please boss, try to get a promotion, spend money to live a balanced life outside your work\" to \"see what others can't see, invest, sell, hire, acquire profit or pay for losses\", you'll become different from most people and won't be able to bond over much.\n\n  \n(b) I don't know about you, but I was severely impacted by the emotional and financial roller coaster of my businesses. At a certain point, I made several mistakes and went bankrupt. I had to juggle unpaid bills, creditors and family responsibilities. There is no crash course about emotional intelligence that is going to prepare you for that. You can't share that situation with most people, they will absolutely freak out. You also can't share the best news with a lot of people. Telling someone that you had an amazing year and your company made millions is going to get an employee relative / friend bitter very fast.\n\n  \n(c) My support system consists of three high school friends that are entrepreneurs.

I say to myself, am i on right track ,the time and energy i am investing will it lead me to the goal i wanted to achieve, and many other doubts and confusion i go through every day. But one thing that makes me get up and work is that, no matter what i am doing , one thing is that i am putting a thought into an action, an idea into a real stuff. That energy that i am putting in real world will not disappear. I know doubt and uncertainty will always be there, but yeah someone have to do the work, no one is coming to hold you and make you to achieve what you want, only you have to do it. You are the responsible for all of that. Just make sure love the journey and document it, and when you feel like you are not going anywhere look at those documents, and you will understand how far you came from an idea to a real existing thing. These things that i am saying feels like motivation but i think that it is psychological thing, kind of build a mindset of keep going. \n\nI will say take it as a war or like a game, if you heard of dark souls, follow that mindset. \n\nI am still on this journey, and i am with you, and i also face the same things everyday ,that you mentioned.

          "body": "Agree with everything OP says. In addition, the hardest truth I learnt is that the feeling of not being good enough never really goes away. You always learn more every day, realise you didn't think of something and have to learn yet another thing from scratch. You start questioning whether you really know anything at all. That feeling paralyses you from doing the learning, being productive and you end up procrastinating because you're overwhelmed. It's important to accept that this feeling won't end.\n\nThe other hard truth I learnt is that without your health, there is no business. I used to be really proud of my lifestyle. Woke up at 5, went to the gym, and ate well and was in incredible shape and was very organised, disciplined, and productive. After being a founder, I feel like I've lost control of everything. I felt guilty for spending time looking after myself and resting. I felt like I should always be working and stopped going gym, ate whatever, slept at random times and tried to work continuously. I've slowly and finally accepted that you need to take days off to rest, eat, and sleep properly. Otherwise, you will burn out fast, and end up being unproductive and inconsistent.\n\nHandling the emotional roller coaster is a beast, but what helped me is talking to other founders and someone who can hold you accountable. I started telling some of the people I see at the gym that I will be there on this day. They're expecting me so I turn up. Same with anything you have been procrastinating on, set a deadline and get someone to hold you accountable. It does work for the short term when you are struggling, and you get stuff done so you don't look stupid. Eventually, you gain control of it yourself and form the discipline necessary. \n\nI've also found that not getting excited regardless of what is happening, whether that is good or bad, keeps me in a balanced emotional state to make sound business decisions. I hope you are doing okay, and it will pay off. Believe in yourself and your dreams.",

      "selftext": "Hi,\n\n**Background**: I was doing well at my job. It was a newly launched staffing agency based in NJ. At that time, it had no clients. I worked there for about 3 years and established the brand.\n\nThen, I decided to work for my own business, I resigned on Sep 26. On October 1st, I started my own marketing agency.  \nI registered an LLC and secured a few projects in the first month. They were small companies with less than 10 employees, as I wanted to start with smaller ones.\n\nI am into lead generation and have about 15 years of experience, so lead generation is like a daily task for me.\n\nAll my 5 clients want to grow their businesses by getting more customers. They don’t care what I am doing, what methods I am working on, or how much social media is helping. Nothing. They just NEED MORE BUSINESS. That’s it.\n\n  \n**The Real Struggle Starts Here:**  \n  \nTo deliver the desired results, I have been spending 8 to 10 hours daily, thinking about new strategies and ideas. I have dedicated one whole day to each project. On Saturday and Sunday, I review the past work and make strategies for the next week.\n\nThere are no off days, no relaxing days, no holidays. I get up in the morning, open my two laptops, and the same process starts again. I hired many resources and employees to share my work, but they could not meet the clients’ expectations.  \nSo, my employees just follow my instructions. These are low-paying projects, that’s why I cannot hire experienced people like project managers, etc.\n\nFurthermore, due to this stressful workload, I couldn’t market my own agency. Its social media pages are inactive.  \nI used to write on Quora and had millions of views there, but now I hardly post once a week.\n\nAfter all expenses, I am earning less than $500 per month now. That means around $6,000 per year, while this was the amount I used to earn every month earlier, working only 8 hours a day, no stress, full 9 hours of sleep, and a peaceful mind.\n\n**The only positive thing I have achieved here is the happiness of my clients. They are getting the leads they expected from me. In fact, my clients love me, and I love working for them.**\n\nBut I think I cannot take this stress anymore.\n\n1. Either I have to choose decent clients who can pay me what I truly deserve,\n2. Or go back to a full-time job again and offer part-time marketing consultation.\n\n**What I learned**\n\n1. Every business wants more clients, not more noise. That’s what I help them get, real, measurable growth. Just wish I had more time to do the same for myself.\n2. Sometimes, chasing freedom ends up costing peace. But even if it’s tough, I’d still choose my own path, because lessons like these can’t be learned in a 9-to-5.\n3. Skills in your field+time management = SUCCESS\n\n ",

          "body": "I recommend building out pro forma financials to see what the numbers need to look like to get you paid what you need in X months. What your margins would likely be. What salary you need. Once you know your revenue target, you can try to back into how many clients at $X per month you'll need. If you have $500/month clients and you need $10,000/month in revenue to drive the comp you need, you'll need 20 clients at that rate. If you can start landing larger clients, say $3,000/month, you only need 3-4. \n\nWhen I started my accounting business, we started with startups that seemed cool at that time. We quickly realized to grow to the size we anticipated with our businesses, we'd need way too many $300/mo type bookkeeping engagements. That's a hell of a lot of work. Often times, smaller clients still have a lot of asks. So we quickly realized our ideal customer profile needed to shift. The level of service we expected to deliver was not meant of for startups. It was 7-figure businesses. \n\nSo you're on the same path as most new business owners. You take on small gigs across various industries and don't get paid much, if anything. You're sacrificing a salary to build your service lines and learn what does and does not work. You're working in the business, not on it. \n\nYou'll want to shift from doing the work to having people do the work. They'll never be as good as you when you're small. You need to scale to get out of that challenge. Read the eMyth book to learn more about working on versus in. I also recommend Fix This Next. That will help you determine where exactly you should be spending your time. Most likely, it will be your sales funnel.",

Outsource small, repetitive tasks.\n\nSecond, you may also find it worthwhile to look into 'Arbitrage'. \n\nYou hire another company to generate the leads - you enrich them or whatever your deliverable requires, add your markup, and in turn provide the polished lead to your client.  \n\nI built an entire side business of providing leads to other companies, some paid by the lead and others by monthly retainer (Larger projects). \n\nIt's not easy - you will need to source and thoroughly vet lead providers while constantly monitoring quality, but the model does work.\n\nHope this helps!",

Learn how every way you can manage your own time.  Digital notebooks,  automate sales and marketing with tech and AI, only answer emails between 8-10 and 4-6.  The rest you spend on selling, building your business, and recruiting.  The very moment you can afford to hire a virtual assistant and outsource on Fiverr, improve your phone sales and virtual sales skills.  Buy your own warm leads to build your business and fill your funnel. Most important is to take care of yourself like an athlete.  Up and bed at the same time,  write your goals and stressors and night.  Read and review in the morning, exercise daily, and never let your business interfere with your core needs: familiy, hobbies, nature, travel, skill building.

Keep increasing prices until you're getting no after no.  \n\nBuild case studies. Get out in the world and network. Meet people. Build relationships. I don't care what year it is nothing beats in real life relationships for early stage growth &amp; sales in a service based business. \n\nGet feedback on your local chamber of commerce from current members(use their directory to call people who are on it and ask them if they have a few minutes to share their opinion....guess what after you've started talking they'll be curious what you do. Now they know 😏.). Maybe join a few of them. Put in major effort. One or two might suck but damn if one works out you'll find yourself a few new customers. Nail down your local SEO. Grow from the inside out geographically.\n\nFind local founder meetups, happy hours etc.\n\nOnce you're doing that be active on LinkedIn and don't post AI garbage. Post actual valuable content and really give people a window into running your agency. Let them be a part of these wins and losses (not client wins or losses but yours as a founder, things you've learned, share stories). Share your plans, strategies you're using to find clients and generate leads for yourself and clients. Bring them in your world.\n\nAnd use your lead generation skills. I know it's scary to spend a budget in the early days. But once you've found a bit of security by attacking things old school use that money to pour some fuel on the fire. \n\nGet creative on some fun campaigns that don't cost ad spend dollars. Set up a table in the busiest park or during a busy event with a shittttty sign that says generate more leads for your business. Ask me anything. (Just an example of a scrappy idea you can do over and over).\n\n$100 profit per client in the USA isn't worth it unless it's strictly to build great case studies but you've had plenty of time to do that. \n\nTime to take the next step.

          "body": "I think almost everybody underestimates how difficult the journey will be. There are countless reasons for that:\n\n1. Survivorship bias: we all hear about the beauty of building a startup, but we only hear from those who have succeeded. We very rarely, if ever, hear from the hundreds who have failed. That said, if you were to believe that 95% of startups fail, that means for every successful entrepreneur we hear from, there are 19 others who never got to share their story and have faded into obscurity.\n\n2. The bias of overconfidence. Think of this like the dunning kruger effect: the less you know about something, the more confident you feel about it. Entrepreneurship is no different in this respect. When we choose this life, very few of us are fully aware of what we are signing up for.\n\n3. The planning fallacy, which Daniel Kahneman talks about beautifully. Basically, whenever we make plans, most of us have a horrible habit of being overly optimistic and systematically underestimating the time, costs, and risks of future actions while overestimating the benefits. \n\nAll that being said, I can also say that if you stick with it, entrepreneurship can be one of the most rewarding things you can do with your time, and I can not imagine myself doing anything else.",

Sounds great until you factor in our 8% net margin - that's about $224K profit before fees.\n\nBreakdown of what we paid:  \n\\- Card transaction fees: roughly $47K  \n\\- ACH transaction fees: roughly $23K  \n\\- Total: $70K gone\n\nThat's 31% of our profit taken. Nearly a third. On a good year.\n\nAnyone else feeling this pain? What has everyone here been using to actually get paid?\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who has responded! Was trying to keep up with everyone but had to log off and now there's way too many to get back to everyone individually.\n\nBeen getting a lot of advice and messages about needing to switch/helping me switch processors. Just want to clarify that I already have switched and haven't paid a dime in processing fees over the past few weeks. Free service, $0 ACH fee, passes card fees automatically, and free instant settlement + can pay my subs. Really appreciate everyone trying to help but don't think I'm gonna find much better than that haha.

If the customers are businesses, they can easily do so. Make sure your bank has configured it wih ACH Positive Pay (a common feature on bank accounts) so fraudsters can't just \"pull\" money from your account by knowing the account number.\n\nThen for those who want to pay by card, add a 3% surcharge.  For those who can't send an ACH, they can give you a check.\n\nYou'll want an \"analyzed\" business checking account, and then with all the above, you'll end up paying $35-50 a month for all the bank services like to receive ACH, and positive pay, and so on.\n\nThere, I just saved you $70k in fees.",

It requires very little equipment that most people don't already own, at least at first.  A first generation immigrant restaurant worker building up a nest egg and using it to open their own place is one of the only paths to prosperity available to someone with a high school education in a foreign language.  And subsequently many of their kids follow this path.  \n\nThe other side of the coin are multi-millionaires with loads of confirmation bias about their abilities due to years of selling annuities to rubes or sitting on a boring family business like an established CPA practice.  They set their kids or wife up with a passion project in a high dollar corporate lease and all the sudden they owe $8k a month for 6 years on a personal guarantee.  Their nepos burn out in 9 months and go back to just existing or maybe limp along for a handful of years. Sometimes this consumes the legacy business as well and tanks the whole family.  Either way it ends up with the usual business for sale listing quoting 4 years of best case scenario revenue as a lump sum pay out. That sits for a year before they offer the place up for raw parts and assumption of the lease.  \n\nSource: former broke ass restaurant worker, former broke ass restaurant owner, former consultant, and current financial advisor.

It was chaotic because they were chatty and I had to herd them and look out for stragglers. I wasn't used to such a large group. I had 16 complete the tour. The whole day had been stressful so I was distracted and forgot to make sure the first person paid me for the extra 4 people before ending the tour last night. Today I'm texting her for the extra tickets and so far she's not answering. Hoping she will eventually, but what can I do if she doesn't? That's $140. May not seem like much, but I'm just one person and that can pay some bills. ",

That number is a bit lower than what you are able to entertain. Now you are realizing that 16 people is a lot. Moving forward, do not go over the usual 12 people, but if a group asks in advance “hey is there any way it could be 14 or 15?” your answer is yes, but you require payment for them 48 hours in advance, otherwise they will be asked to leave at the time of the tour. They should know this, because now it’s in a contract that they sign. \n\nNow let’s say that someone *doesn’t ask* because of course, that’s going to happen. Either the extra participants are not allowed to participate, or, they have to pay a $10 convenience/last minute fee on top of the ticket fee. The booker shouldn’t gawk at this, because they will have signed a contract upon payment that says “I understand that any added participants must be agreed upon with the tour guide and paid in full at least 48 hours in advance of the tour. Failure to communicate and pay for them in advance will result in those participants to be turned away from the tour unless the extra participants pay for their ticket plus a $10 convenience fee before the tour starts.” \n\n\nIf you don’t have a contract that they sign, get one. I believe that you have some legal precedent to have her pay if you both agreed in writing, but to be honest, I would just cut the loss if she never responds and use this money to make a contract if you don’t have one that includes contingencies and policies like this.",

I am really taken back by this situation, especially as it has been 5 years since they purchased this item from me, and the item was quality checked before shipping.\n\nDo they have a claim for a full refund after the lengthy time period? Worth noting, they are in a different country- one outside the EU. Any advice would be helpful.",

          "body": "There is a difference between a refund policy and a warranty.  Usually a refund policy is like 30 days, and may be store credit only, that type of thing. It enables a husband to buy a gift and return or exchange it if his wife doesn’t like it — meaning the purpose of it is to help you sell more.  Sometimes people will abuse these, the obvious example in your business being to wear something for a party or wedding and then return it or something. Anyway, that’s a return policy. \n\nA warranty is your guarantee that something is made with good workmanship and you will stand by it.  A pavé diamond should not fall out of a ring, for example, and if it does you will replace it maybe. A warranty can be time based or “lifetime” or whatever you decide but the important thing is workmanship. If the item is properly made and the person decides they no longer like it or want it, or they failed to care for it and it’s dirty, or whatever else that does not go to workmanship, it is not your problem to fix this at your expense.  Is the ring moldy because of workmanship?  Is it tarnished because it was improperly coated and the coating wore off (idk about this stuff, just hazarding guesses)?  If so you can repair. If the workmanship is on some dimension truly poor, you can offer a refund. It does not sound like this is the case. \n\nSome jewelers offer free cleaning for life.  This is a nice thing to do but also brings people back to your store maybe to buy more jewelry, so it’s not entirely motivated by generosity. \n\nWhy don’t you tell her, bring the item by, I’ll clean it and take a look at it and see if there’s anything wrong with it.  Clean it and make it look nice. Then say, there’s nothing wrong with it, so I can’t take it as a return. If it can be resold or has value in the precious metals, you can offer to accept it in exchange for a 40% discount on something else in the store or something, and give her those choices. \n\nThere is nothing she can threaten you with that is going to go anywhere in a court of law and I would ignore any such treats and stop responding to her if she won’t stop making them.  Again, this assumes you didn’t sell something of shoddy workmanship with a lifetime guarantee. \n\nYou should make your returns and warranty policies clear and in writing and print them on your receipts. ",

It's a fairly nice one. Probably worth $800 or $900.  Flaky hard drive, all told about a $200/fix for replacement drive and reload windows we or else I'm able to recover most of her pictures and other personal files. \n\nShe had also brought along her Microsoft office discs and a few other common applications. We went ahead and loaded those up for her too. \n\nShe brought it in on a love Monday afternoon in July, it was ready for her to pick up Wednesday afternoon.  We called her and left a message that it was ready. \n\nFriday we call again and she answers we confirm that she knows that her machine is ready. She said she would be by to pick it up in a couple of days. \n\nA week later, we call she doesn't answer. We leave her a message reminding her that her computer is ready. \n\nWe do that every week for about a month.  No reply.\n\nSo I tell the employees not to bug her and she will show up when she shows up.  August passes.  On September first I call and leave a message that am the owner of the shop and letting her know that under CA law if she doesn't come pick up her machine we have the option to sell it to satisfy the outstanding bill.\n\nShe calls back an hour later and says she will pick it up tomorrow..\n\nTomorrow comes and goes.  \n\nOctober first I Mail a copy of the invoice, showing an additional storage fee, and a note that if she does not pick up her computer within the next 90 days, it will be sold to satisfy the outstanding bill. \n\nTechnically I only have to wait 30 days  and that 30 passed at the end of August. \n\nNovember 1st I send out another copy of that letter with an additional storage fee and a warning that it will be sold in 60 days. \n\nDecember 1st another copy of that letter , storage fee, the warning will be sold in 30 days.\n\nJanuary 2nd I send out one that I will sell her machine for the amount due on her bill.  Unless she picks it up by January 10th.\n\nNothing..  i waited until Feb 1.  \n\nI  post it on FB with pics and all the specs, price ... The exact amount of her outstanding bill.\n\nI had my tech dump her personal files on a dvd just for sake of argument.  Then reloaded it with a fresh copy of Windows again so as not to include any of the customers personal files.\n\nLaptop was sold on Feb 2nd.  We included the software that she had brought with the laptop when she came in.\n\nFast forward to April 10th.  She shows up at the shop looking for her laptop...it's been 9 months from the time she dropped it off.  Fortunately I was there when she came in. \n\nI told her her computer was sold 2 months ago, for the price of her outstanding bill.  It took about 15 minutes and the arrival of the police department to get her to stop screaming.  \n\nShe of course wanted to file a police report saying that we had stolen her computer etc etc.  one of the cops asked about the whole thing and I gave him the nutshell version of the story above and showed him the invoices... He agreed that there was no crime here. \n\nWe offered her the dvd with her personal files which just enraged her further.  At that point, we're not even obligated to preserve any of her pictures or files.\n\nSo I hoped it was over at that point.... Silly me. \n\nShe called probably close to 50 times over the next 6 months...  And would start giving her sob story about how I had stolen her computer, she would beg various staff members to give her the name of the person that we had sold it to so that she could try to go buy it back from them.\n\nBasically standing instructions became if this lady calls they would direct her to me, at which point she would hang up.\n\nShe filed a complaint with the state agency that regulated our shop.   15-minute phone call and an emailed copy of the invoice, they dropped the investigation as without merit.\n\nShe kept calling about every other month for the next 3 YEARS..  On several occasions she got a new employee who would be concerned until they looked up her account... referred them to me or one of the more experienced techs... And she would hang up.",

He looked decent on paper so I gave him and chance and hired him as a contractor him for a one off project. Today was his first day and was 40 mins late. WTF!!\n\nI hate to be someones dad or lecture him like a school principal but arriving late on the first day of ANYTHING is a terrible first impression. School, job, meeting, even first date just starts the entire experience on a bad note.\n\nI'm thinking about just cutting him loose after today. It might be a bit harsh but just showing up the first day 40 mins late after begging me for a shot gives me a gut feeling he's going to be a bigger headache than a diamond in the rough.\n\nHas anyone had a similar experience or got burned hiring an unproven person, family member, or person with a sob story?",

Broke down several times and finally limped home when I fibbed and said the sheriff had a warrant for him.  Truth be told, the cops didn’t care.\n\nHe eventually went to jail for scamming someone on a fence job, wife left him, etc  and seems to have finally gotten straight. \n\nI’m the guy who always wants to give someone a chance, but to be honest, if someone’s at rock bottom, they’ve probably already exhausted every opportunity that’s been offered. ",

Unfortunately, I ended up spending a ton of time trying to coach them and help them improve skills that were absolutely below expectation, then caught them committing Medicaid fraud and lying about shifts that they said they worked but didn't just a few months after hiring them. When I fired them, and they could say was, \"sorry,\" and just walked out silently.

He said he'd meet me there at 10am. I showed up and he had brought a pair of slacks,  a button down shirt, and a clean pair of shoes and socks. He gave me a fake interview so that I could practice interviewing. And then sent me off.  I didn't get the job.  But the next day I brought him the clothes and shoes back the he let me borrow and said thanks. He could see I was disappointed and that night brought me and my group a cake.  A few days later,  he told me that they just promoted a busser and were looking for a new busser. I started the next day. The prep cook let me sleep on his couch.

I made it optional because I did not want to force customers to buy it, even though it costs me a lot to provide the option. I already carry liability insurance, but if a customer damages the boat, they are responsible for those costs. The rental insurance offers several affordable plans to give customers extra peace of mind.\n\nAfter this customer made his reservation, I called him to review the meeting location and details, which are also included in the confirmation email. I like to do this personally to make sure everything is clear and to answer any questions.\n\nI also explained that he would receive a second email where he would need to sign the waiver and other documents. After that, the rental insurance page would appear, clearly marked as optional, and he could choose to decline it.\n\nHe became irritated and said I was not being transparent and that he did not appreciate it. I explained that the insurance is completely optional and that we only offer it because other customers have requested it. It is even mentioned at the beginning of the confirmation email.\n\nHe told me I had ruined his fun and said he felt obligated to buy insurance. I repeated that he did not have to purchase it, but he said, “Well, now I am worried something might happen during my trip,” and then he hung up.\n\nI am honestly confused about how I was not being transparent. If you rent a car or book a flight, they always offer optional insurance. It is the same concept. I just want to make sure my customers feel safe and protected, not pressured.",

          "body": "This is the customer's problem for the most part, so no harm done...but if you're noticing a lot of people are dropping off at the insurance page, then you might want to think about testing some alternative routes to booking completion.\n\nNote, I'm not saying you've done anything wrong at all here, just that you could potentially convert those people who are upsell / add-on averse like what happened here to potentially another successful rental.\n\nThe problem is, people see that second page and think \"why are they trying to sell me insurance now? If I needed it, why isn't it included?\" They might even go so far as to start thinking along the lines of \"this is how they get you\" - and a that would be both ends of that scale - \"they sell you insurance you don't need!\" AND \"they'll screw you for any damage at the other end, and tell you that you should have bought the insurance!!\". Obviously neither are true, but people - bloody hell.\n\nInstead of making the insurance optional in an additional step, try showing both options on the same page - still making it super clear one is WITH accidental damage insurance, and one WITHOUT. Maybe add some wording that the expectation is they bring their own insurance or take the risk, on their wallet be it.\n\nMaybe even try just one price - with insurance included as standard - and having the option to REMOVE it, instead of add it. You just need to be careful about how you can advertise your pricing then, so you don't price yourself out of the market against competitors who don't include insurance.\n\nThe reason these kinds of approaches can work? You're making them feel more in control - making their own choices, kind of thing. It's not an upsell when the options are all presented the same page, it's an informed choice.\n\nDo note however that sometimes, the smallest changes can have the biggest impacts, but good AND bad...so whenever you're testing things like this, be ready to be analysing your numbers as close to realtime as you can - have solid baseline figures recorded so you're not just going off 'feel' (though that is also important), and change or revert these changes if they're showing a negative impact.",

Seeing the cost go up and up and up and up. \n\n\nI only have three people a lot of policy in my insurance went up 16% \n\nBut it goes up pretty much every year and my insurance guy who I think has a pretty good understanding of the industry (and I’m lucky that he takes care of me because there’s not a lot of money in dealing with a small group like mine)\n\n\nHe taught me a lot about healthcare in the role insurance plays in it\n\nNobody cares about the cost of healthcare claims. All they care about is the cost of premium so nobody attributes the cost of claims to what they actually pay. They just would like that cost around differently, which is driven up the costs\n\nThe one thing he taught me that really hit home was Medicare and Medicaid pay much lower reimbursement than typical insurance companies do, and because of the fact they pay reduce rates for claims healthcare providers raise the cost for all of us who aren’t on those programs \n\n\nPeople can blame it on greed or profits but if you go to a university hospital or a nonprofit hospital, you’re paying roughly the same rates as you were at a for-profit hospital \n\n\nBut the bottom line is the fact that cost so much to provide this benefit to our employees… it’s tough\n\nI have a good friend who is executive at a nonprofit and their employees are freaking out because they’re deductible is going up to $1000 rather than 500 … and the employees aren’t paying a penny more for their coverage in premiums a month but the nonprofits gotta pay an additional 11%(keeping the deductible. The same would’ve made it go up something like 19%)\n\nHe told budget to take a look at their financial reports which everyone can look at and ask them where the money is gonna come from… how can they keep the coverage the same without increasing cost to employees?)\n\n\nPeople are legit shocked when they find out that while they pay $100 a month for their individual health insurance that their employers are paying six or 700 \n\nPeople who are fortunate enough to get family coverage and maybe pay for $500 a month think that they’re really getting hosed until they find out their employers are paying 1500 or more on top of the 500 \n\nBut the costs are getting higher and higher because every year the cost of claims goes up and I rarely see people talk about the cost of claims as being something we have to look at\n\nI’m not criticizing you for this you like a lot of people are just frustrated that our cost of doing business or going out, but I don’t think we’re going to see any improvements until people start being honest about what the real challenges has to do with the cost of claims",

My broker said 20%+ and more across the board for small and large groups in my state.\n\nI’m surprised at those who suggesting we jump on the ACA right now. Respectfully, you do know the Fed government is shut down over this issue? I have employees who used that as a great lower cost option in past several years, for their spouse as we pay employee coverage 100%. Now finding out their coverage is not great anymore, as it keeps getting chipped away at, and if subsidies expire they could be paying double soon. Paying out of pocket for spousal coverage on our plan will take a huge chunk of their paycheck. And we pay very competitively in our market.\n\nI do also feel I have a moral obligation to offer my employees excellent healthcare. It’s not right this is our job - I shouldn’t play God &amp; get to decide if you get a PPO or HMO just because you work for me. Once you deep dive on coverage, anything less than a PPO is not worth the money in my opinion. And it’s well known in my area that if you don’t have PPO you’ll have a hard time finding doctors.\n\nClearly folks who think you can get by on catastrophic coverage are young have never had serious or chronic illness. May you forever stay so lucky. I’ve endured stage III cancer, a major accident, and recurring illness and I can rattle on the daily costs of those. It’s not just the immediate cost of care it’s the follow ups, monitoring and specialists. 1 in 3 people will see cancer in their lifetime. And everyone deserves preventative care whether you are 25 or 60. To wait until the worst happens means potentially missing something that could have been caught early, saved the insurance company tens of thousands, saved your employer from losing you in the workforce, and saved you your life.\n\nSorry for the rant, but we should be all very concerned about fixing healthcare. Large business can absorb the increases. But this and other rising costs greatly jeopardize the existence of small business.",

      "selftext": "We opened up a music store a few miles from another music store that is focused on different things (we focus on school band instrument repair and rentals, other shop mostly does used gear and sells records) we are about as different as an automotive body shop is to an automotive mechanical repair shop. \n\nI have had only one interaction with the other store - he kicked me out and cursed at me when I went to deliver a package that was mistakenly delivered to us when we first opened. Other than that, I do not know him. \n\nShortly after that interaction, he started advertising that he does \"band instruments rentals\" and offering \"woodwind and brass repair\" - which is what we are focused on. It didn't bother us at all, we do not talk badly of him to anyone. Though many customers have come in and told us some very nasty stories about him - we just say we do not know him and haven't been in his shop. \n\nOver the last year we started getting negative reviews from what appear to be new Google accounts with made up scenarios and stories every other month or so. It is just my husband and I who work here so we really do know every interaction and can back it up with camera footage if need be. \n\nOne review said they took a lesson from us and was treated poorly. At the time of the review, I only had one lesson student, so it was false. After responding to the review that it was fake, the reviewer changed it to, \"called about a repair and no one got back to me\" we checked our voicemail, emails, call log and not a single person had called about repairs that we hadn't replied to. Google will not remove the review. \n\nWe got about 4 more after that and it dropped our 5 star rating to a 4.5, we have gotten a few of them removed, but two won't go away no matter how much reporting. We do reply to all of the reviews and state that what they are saying did not happen and suggest it may have been left for the wrong business. \n\nWe have no proof that it is the other store owner, other than two reviews use the same initials as the guy lol \nEvery single one comes from a google account with 0 other reviews. We have tried to counteract with getting customers to leave 5 star reviews but it still is very frustrating this is happening. \n\nHas anyone dealt with this? Is there anything we can even do other than keep reporting the reviews and encouraging more customers to leave us reviews? Getting people to leave reviews feels like pulling teeth. 😅",

Bills and receipts are a lot more work but can be optional depending on what your business needs, so if you're looking to do less admin on your end, you can provide your bookkeeper with view only access, and eliminate sortware-based receipt tracking (or track receipts only above certain amounts). You can also use a receipts-only email address that you and your bookkeeper both have access to, or use a receipts tool (i.e. Hubdoc) to streamline things.

You can basically drop in your bank statement or invoice in QuickBooks will pass all the information and do the reconciliation or create a bill for you. \nWe do $2.5 to 3.5 million dollars a year and bookkeeping takes me less than an hour every week.  \nYou definitely need something in place to know how you are doing on a monthly basis, instead of waiting until the end of the year. Even the top-tier QuickBooks online version is only about $200 a month. You can even add a live bookkeeper option for $20 a month and talk to a real person to walk you through any struggles with classifications or journal entires. \nBeing a business owner can be a pain in the ass, but having a firm grasp on your numbers is something you should definitely make time for.

          "body": "Making a second comment for more detail, there is a ton of advice here but here is a playbook:\n\nStarting out:\n\n\\- If you don't have an accountant doing your taxes, get one, non-negotiable  \n\\- HIGHLY recommended: read \"The Accounting Game\". It's written as a kids book/workbook but introduces you to the basics of business accounting very gently. We did this as a workshop in my company for anyone who might talk to clients about budgets/finances and it was immensely beneficial.  \n\\- MINIMUM BAR: put your transaction details in a spreadsheet  \n\\- Preferable: use an accounting system. Wave has a free version and it's a great place to start. Enter your transactions manually, and it will give you a proper balance sheet and P&amp;L. This will make things easier (read: cheaper) for your accountant to do tax prep. You can run invoices from here too.\n\nGrowing up a little:\n\n\\- Use paid version of Wave to automatically connect your bank account OR use another system that does the same (we use Xero, Quickbooks online is the market lead), just run invoices from whatever system you choose.  \n\\- Reconcile transactions once per week in the system, this is generally as easy as picking a category and clicking a button. For your size, should only take 15 mins / week. Get familiar enough with the process so that you can understand it for the next stage. Understanding debits/credits and how they work in a double entry accounting system, vs what types of accounts to use (asset/expense/liability etc..) will give you a foundational education that will help you later in your business as you grow it.\n\nDelegate:\n\n\\- Once you have a system in place, the basics working, and it's getting a little more complex and/or time consuming......get a bookkeeper.  \n\\- Cheap option: Virtual assistant from somewhere like the Philippines. This should get you the basic legwork done pretty easily without having to do anything yourself.  \n\\- More expensive: outsourced bookkeeper / service / agency: this is where we are now, we pay $2500/month and this includes payroll, bookkeeping, and a bunch of tax account management. Invoicing would be included but ours is a bit too project dependent to reliably outsource currently.\n\nTAX: I don't know where you are at specifically, but this is general advice for US based - the other advantage to a good bookkeeper is to find someone who can manage the tax accounts. Unemployment insurance, state by state accounts if you hire in different locations, and a bunch more. These are just awful to self manage.\n\nLast note: later on, a good bookkeeper can help you level up your financial management of the company. For example if you hire sales people, or some internal operations people you may want to categorize them differently to track a more accurate gross margin vs opex vs net margin. When you do this, reconciling payroll suddenly becomes more complex, which is why you need a good bookkeeper, it unlocks more capability as well as managing the mundane stuff you shouldn't be doing.",

One of our founding clients has approached us about going exclusive - they want us to dissolve our agency and work only for them as their dedicated in-house marketing team.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- 17 clients generating solid revenue ($48K per month) \n\n- 9-person team (2 partners + 7 staff)\n\n- Client proposing exclusive deal has been with us since Year 1 (currently paying $9500/mo) \n\n- They've grown significantly with us (but only getting ~15-20% of our bandwidth currently)\n\n- They're our largest single client but represent &lt;20% of our revenue \n\n**The Proposal:**\n- 12-month exclusive contract\n- We'd reduce from 9 to 4 people (me, business partner, 2 key team members)\n- Compensation: Base monthly retainer + 10% commission on their course/digital product sales\n- Scope: Personal brand, company brand, course business, potential support for spouse's brand\n- We'd be walking away from 80%+ of our current revenue to take this\n\n**The Numbers Being Discussed:**\n- $379K for the 4 person team ($144k yearly salary  for me and my partner each) \n- Commission could add $10-50K+ if we scale their course business\n- This would roughly match our current personal income but with commission upside (currently making $7k a month + building cash reserve for agency) \n- We'd go from managing 17 clients to 100% focus on one brand ecosystem\n\n**What We're Torn On:**\n\nPros:\n- Simplified operations (1 client vs 17)\n- Higher personal income potential with commission structure\n- Deep partnership with someone we've proven success with\n- 12-month contract = stability\n- Elimination of constant sales/client management\n- Can build elite expertise in one vertical\n\n**Cons:**\n- 100% concentration risk\n- Walking away from $460K+ annual revenue from other clients\n- Pausing agency growth trajectory (we could hit $1M+ in 3-5 years)\n- If it fails, we rebuild from zero\n- Letting go of 5 team members\n- No diversification\n\n**Questions for You:**\n\n1. **Has anyone made a similar pivot?** How did it turn out?\n\n2. **Is $30-32K/month + 10% commission fair** for dissolving a multi-client agency and going exclusive? Or are we undervaluing ourselves?\n\n3. **Red flags we should watch for?** Client has been great for 2 years, but exclusive relationships can change dynamics.\n\n4. **Contract terms we absolutely need?** We're thinking 12-month minimum, quarterly advance payments, 90-day notice. What are we missing?\n\n5. **How do you value opportunity cost?** Is the simplified life worth the concentration risk?\n\n6. **Anyone regret going exclusive?** What would you do differently?\n\n**Additional Context:**\n- Client is ready to scale (proven product-market fit with their course)\n- They have budget and seem committed\n- We'd still own our systems/processes\n- Could theoretically rebuild agency if this ends\n\n**The Real Question:**\nAre we crazy for even considering this? Or is this the kind of focused partnership that could be more valuable than spreading ourselves thin across 17 clients?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who's faced a similar decision - especially if you've been on either side of an exclusive arrangement.\n\n**Edit:** To clarify - we're not desperate or struggling. Agency is healthy and growing. This is purely a strategic decision about depth vs. breadth.",

The biggest issue is you are giving up a stable situation with a lot of long-term upside for a position that only has a short-term guarantee and that introduces a lot of risk.  \n\nI would encourage you to consider the exclusive deal as something more like an acquisition.  If they were buying your company, they would have to pay you the value of the current business, and/or in some combination give you a job at a guaranteed rate for some length of time, plus some earn-out and/or success-based compensation.  This is something like what they are proposing, except the guarantee isn't very long, and even if you max out the commission, it doesn't seem like they are paying you enough to throw away the rest of your business.  They would also have to be paying you enough to walk away from the future growth of that business -- just as in an acquisition, except you might not be looking to sell if you still have a lot of value-maximization to do in growing the company.  It's hard to imagine them ever wanting to pay enough for a 1-year deal with you to balance all that out, but if you want to exit to them and can get them to pay for the terminal value of the business, maybe it's a conversation.\n\nIt's also unclear what is motivating them to do this.  Are they not getting enough resources from you?  Get a larger guarantee from them and scale up the team serving them.  Give them some kind of preferred rate and priority SLA in exchange for it, and make sure X% of your personal time is focused on that business.  Spend the rest of your time and/or find other folks to keep growing the business that is not with this client.",

If you want to sell your soul and work for the man again, then consider the deal. Otherwise take the solid advice laid out here by others and set this account up with a curated team. Make sure the contract has a no solicitation clause for your top talent who will work the account and that your margins are set at a high enough level (higher than now) to compensate you for the loss of these team members on your other accounts. After all, you are incurring an opportunity cost by taking them out of service to others. Also consider emphasizing to the client that they do currently benefit from the fact that you are actively working in the same and perhaps other industries that will keep your content cutting edge sharp. If they insist on bringing it in house and they are a big enough growth partner, offer to help them set it up, find a few employees and provide 100 percent cooperation with their internal team.  Then, stay involved in the account growth… the new internal team does the simple stuff to save them some $ and give them the speed to market or whatever controls they are craving and you do the amazing, impactful, big idea work. Set up a mutual progress meeting quarterly. If they want exclusivity within their specific industry, no problem, but that costs more (unless this is not an issue for you) Good luck and remember, being your own bosses is why you are here!! PS, I’m marking 30 years in business with my partner come next February in marketing promotional &amp; packaging design and associated services,  including a solid but short run into digital marketing, content and SM marketing that we spun off.

      "selftext": "\nSo back when I was in my sophomore year, I got this idea to start a small clothing brand. I was broke, drowning in assignments &amp; honestly thought it’d be a fun way to make a little money in college\n\nThe idea was to do retro sports-wear, kinda like those 90s oversized tees with old school fonts and colors. I sketched out a few designs, made a logo on Canva *(yeah I know, rookie move)* &amp; thought I was ready to build a brand overnight 😭\n\nAt first I tried finding local printers but everything was way too expensive. Minimum orders were like 50 shirts and I had no clue if anyone would even buy them. So I started small with print on demand just to test the waters. My friends ordered a few and wore them around campus which actually gave me some confidence\n\nThe hard part wasn’t design, it was figuring out how to get people to care. Marketing was way harder than I expected. I made an Insta page, got like 100 followers, then hit a wall. I didn’t have time to post daily or run ads, and I didn’t wanna beg friends to buy stuff\n\nAfter a few months I basically ran out of steam. I sold maybe 20 shirts total. Nothing crazy but it was fun seeing something I made actually out there in the world\n\nLooking back now, I realize I rushed into it without a real plan. I should’ve done more research on brand positioning and maybe tested more designs before launching\n\nIf any of you have done something similar, what would you have done differently? Like, if you were starting a clothing brand in college today, how would you go about it?",

Call it \"It Has Pockets!\" or similar. Have a way for customers to choose from a variety of pocket styles/sizes/materials, pick up the clothing or have a drop-off point on campus (or a nearby drycleaner or something), add the pockets, drop the clothing back or have it available for pickup. Fast turnaround times and college-centric branding (to start) to emphasize it's a student-run microbusiness. Talk to some tailoring businesses in the area to see what they'd charge to do the same work, to get an idea of market prices and whether it would be simpler to just whitebox/resell their services, do the sewing yourself, or have a couple of part-time employees, maybe even 'work at home' people who are interested in the concept, have the sewing skills, and would prefer you handle pickup/dropoff.",

It costs me $250 a month and part of that cost is that I have to sign up for a plan with a DCP doctor. That means that if you get sick the doctor's visit is free because you're already paying the doctor a monthly fee to see you whenever you want. The health share only covers serious things like cancer or breaking your leg. And you have to cover the first 5 grand. But then the health share kicks in and it covers it 100%. So basically it makes you want to stay healthy because it would get expensive if you're not and your body starts falling apart.\n\nEdit: word",

Also, what’s your projected income for the year? That info can make a big difference in what kind of options might be available.\n\nDepending on the type of plan, there may be alternatives to compare ACA plans, private/off exchange plans, or other options, just to see what fits your budget and coverage needs.

          "body": "Hi,\n\nI own my multi-service company and one of our services is marketing. Being in the field of IT and having already some clients through referrals would be enough to kick off with marketing.\n\nUsually you would have 3 options. Hire a freelancer, hire in-house or hire with a marketing company/agency.\n\nHiring freelancer might be the most economical, but need to be careful, lots of people in freelancing might promise but under-deliver for what you've paid. But once you find a great one with honest work, it will be great asset for the business. Just heads up with the professionals. Always ask for referrals and previous work. \n\nHiring in-house is ratherly expensive these days and also there is the process of hiring. But you have the option to choose a great experienced marketer which could pay itself off. The only issue with this is really the cost to the business.\n\nHiring a company/agency might feel a little better but there's a similar issue to the freelancers which is over-promising but under-delivering, only under a contract. I would say hiring a company is the riskiest because of the contracts. But if you work with a company that's great at their jobs and at least can provide a fine ROI, they will be reliable partner. Cost is more than freelancer but usually less than in-house but it has an advantage because you hire a whole team.\n\n\nThere is also a +1 option which is to learn yourself, but as you've said, it's time consuming and even more time consuming to master it. But once you've master it, there are no additional costs you would have to pay. \n\nI just wanted to point out the important details during your search. As long as you don't fall for false promises you're all good. Important to always keep in mind \"no one can promise or guarantee results in the field of marketing\"\n\nIf you would like to, we can just discuss further. Not trying to pitch myself, but I can share some of expertise if you don't know the market at all.",

You need to focus on one niche - the websites or the IT stuff. If you want to do both, spin off the web design stuff as a DBA and make a new brand for just that and keep the IT brand seperate. \n\nThen, you need your google business profiles for each one, with lots of reviews. Then you need your location pages for your different services and locations like “cyber security experts in Rockford, IL” and Chicago, and Naperville, and oak park.  A home page can’t rank for every service and every location. You make pages specific for each one so they have a better shot at ranking and being found. \n\nThen there’s blogging. You need to write a blog answering the most commonly searched questions related to your work. Use a service like this \n\nhttps://answerthepublic.com\n\nAnd find a topic to write about. This will bring visitors to the site and add more content and authority in Google’s eyes. A good blog answers questions. \n\nNext is get off fiver. Full of low quality leads that are bottom of the barrel on pricing. They don’t value your skills. They value paying as little as possible. Not great clients. \n\nChicago is a tough market because it’s competitive. Ranking won’t be easy. And you might need to hire an SEO guy.

But make sure you have someone who can marry that process (and hit targets) with digital marketing: ads, content and audience growth. So your kpi's would be: how many visited your site, signed up to x marketing thing, contacted you etc. \nThey then need to be able to onboard those new eads &amp; prospects into a sales funnel - offers for early adopters, promo's, relationship building, whatever your end goal is or your own success metrics are. \nSo these 3 steps should be part of your person's competencies: identifying target markets, route to those markets (lead gen &amp; digital and/or traditional marketing) and 3rdly conversion into sales plan.

It's the equivalent of putting up a quick and dirty billboard made with microsoft word\n\nYour kind of work is not about big picture marketing, you just need to pay for search ads and those ads need to lead to an attractive landing page that is good at generating leads. Yes technically this is marketing but you don't need to be hitting up social media or paying for TV ads or anything like that.\n\nOnce you have a good looking functional website with good SEO and a well done landing page for your paid ads, it's basically set and forget. This admittedly is a whole can of worms to learn in of itself but seeing as you make websites already half the battle you can do yourself. It is worthwhile effort to learn effort if you're at all good with research and happen to have the time (because its slow). Alternatively you can outsource this to a google ads/SEO manager, which can be worth it. I'd find someone reputable local to do help you if you decide you have the budget to do it vs doing it yourself because ads/SEO people are a minefield of wannabes, scammers, and fake results. Maybe you can reach out to one of your current/past clients who seem to have a good ad/web presence and ask who they use?\n\nExpect to spend something like 10-15% on revenue on ads + management of them by the way if you want good results. It's worth it. We went through a slump at the beginning of this year and started spinning ads up for the first time. It's been a learning process but its absolutely paid for itself within the first month. For your industry in particular you could probably benefit from a real SEO guy you pay monthly on contract (again, ask locally), because to really kill it on the SEO front requires posting lots of relevant articles a month to your website involving your field. This signals to google that you're an authority on the subject (plus GPT searches really like that kind of content), and for your type of business coming off as an authority on information relating to what you do is valuable (vs a restaurant or a mill shop where its less useful). At least that's how it was last I checked - the google SEO landscape changes all the damn time so maybe posting frequent articles isn't so hot right now. But yeah - a good SEO guy will completely take care of all of that for you. \n\nAlso it should be said - focus on local. Go to business networking meetups, find other businesses and be seen in person. Get coffee/lunch dates with people you want to connect with. This builds healthy foundations and relationships for your business which are the real secret to success.",

Invoice chasing is just a reality of b2b unfortunately. Timesheets and invoicing workflows depend a lot on your specific setup.\n\nThe receipts and expense tracking side got way easier for us when we switched to Ramp - that cut down on a chunk of the bookkeeper questions and manual reconciliation stuff. \n\nAt 40k MRR you're probably right that a full time finance person is premature, but you might be at the point where a part time bookkeeper who does more than just answer your questions could take some of this off your plate. Or even a VA for invoice follow ups. The goal isn't to get to 0 hours (impossible) but getting it under 5 to 7 hours seems doable with the right automation + delegation.\n\n  \nHope it helped :)",
