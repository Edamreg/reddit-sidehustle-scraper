Annual performance and salary reviews is sales opportunity.\n\n3. If you ever wanted to build something for yourself, sales is the first skill you will need. Want to start a marketing agency?

          "body": "Yes, I started a side hustle in 2018 and walked away from my 9-5 in 2022, after building it into a six-figure business. People have different reasons for wanting to escape the 9-5. In my case, I was burned out, dealing with an abusive, toxic boss. I was 42 years old at the time, married, with three kids, and a single-income family (my wife is a homemaker). I was staring down another 20 years and felt like I had no options. \n\nI could have jumped ship to the same job at another company, but I knew it could turn out just as bad, or worse. I also wanted more freedom. I was tired of faking enthusiasm at work, and wanted more freedom to travel and spend time with my kids. \n\nAnyways, in the first month (June 2018), I made $200 with my side hustle. One year later, I was making $2000, then $5000, and so on. In September 2022, I reached a point where I was making the same income on the side as I was at my 9-5 (around $120k/year). \n\nI went to a conference in Orlando, Florida, hoping to get one more client for my business. If that happened, I could leave my 9-5 within about 6 months. But I got 5 clients at the conference, flew home, and told my wife I had to make a choice. I had to choose between turning down all the work I landed or quitting my job. I could no longer balance both.   \n  \nShe immediately said, \"It's time for you to quit. You got this.\"  \n\nI called my boss at the bank and gave him my 2 weeks notice over the phone. He thought I was crazy (he also thought my side hustle was selling t-shirts) lol. I walked out of my office for the last time on October 1, 2022.  \n\nI've never experienced a greater feeling of freedom than that moment. And it hasn't subsided. I think about it every day. I managed to build a fully remote lifestyle business in my mid-40s and exited the corporate world during my peak earning years. \n\nToday, my once side hustle is now a $20k/month business (2 businesses actually - I started a second one).   \nMy kids are all out of the house (our youngest is 19 and is moving to Hawaii for 6 months in a couple of weeks). My wife and I will be travelling this winter (we live in Canada), and I'll just work from my laptop. My wife helps me run the business.   \n  \nIf you're just getting started and want to build something that you can scale full-time, but don't know what to focus on, here's my advice:   \n  \nThe perfect side side hustle has 3 ingredients: \n\n1. Something you're good at (don't follow your passion, follow your talent and skills). If you lack the skills, pick something that you can learn. \n\n2. Something you enjoy: It doesn't have to be your lifelong passion, but if you're going to invest thousands of hours building something, you can't hate it. Here's the good news (relating to step 1)... people usually enjoy what they're good at. \n\n3. Something you can scale: Don't start a side hustle that can't replace your 9-5 income. That's fine if you're just wanting to make a few extra bucks on the side, but not if you want to escape the 9-5. So, no Uber or Lyft...no DoorDash or dog-walking. Ain't gonna cut it. Think, service-based businesses aka freelancing. That's your best bet to make good money fast. \n\nI could go on forever (sorry for the long-winded post), but my last piece of advice is to just get started. Most people want to figure everything out BEFORE they start, but you can't get clarity until AFTER taking action. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions about my story or need any help!",

          "body": "Not there yet, but actively building toward it. Here's my path so far:\n\nContext: 49, full-time job, two kids, building products between 9 PM and midnight after everyone's asleep.\n\nWhat I'm building: Portfolio of small digital products (SaaS/web apps) solving problems I've personally experienced. Currently have 2 launched, 3 more in development.\n\nCurrent state: \\~$150 MRR across products. Not replacement income, but proof the concept works.\n\nTimeline: Started learning to code (with AI tools - I'm not technical) in March 2025. So about 9 months in.\n\nThe strategy that's working:\n\nMultiple small bets instead of one big bet. Each product targets different audiences (family memory preservation, burnout prevention for founders, productivity coaching, etc.). If one fails, the others keep building.\n\nShip fast, ship imperfect. I've learned more from 2 launched products than I did from 6 months of planning.\n\nBuild from personal pain. Every product solves a problem I actually had. Makes the marketing authentic because I'm just sharing my story.\n\nWhat I'm learning:\n\nIt's a marathon. 9 months in, I'm nowhere near quitting my job, but the trajectory is there. Each month the products improve, the revenue grows (slowly), the audience builds.\n\nAge is actually an advantage. 20+ years of business experience means I know how to talk to customers, position products, avoid obvious mistakes. I don't have the energy I had at 25, but I don't waste time on BS either.\n\nThe \"work whenever/wherever\" dream is real but requires building the foundation first. Right now I'm grinding nights and weekends. But I can see the path to freedom.\n\nTactical advice:\n\nDon't wait for the perfect idea. Start with something you personally need and would pay for. If you'd pay for it, others probably will too.\n\nPortfolio &gt; single product. Diversification isn't just for stocks. Multiple small income streams are more stable than betting everything on one app.\n\nUse AI tools if you're not technical. Claude + Cursor = I can build functional products despite zero coding background before 2024.\n\nReality check: I'm not posting this from a beach with laptop. I'm still grinding the 9-5. Still building at night exhausted. Still months/years away from replacement income.\n\nBut the dream is closer than it was 9 months ago. And that's progress.\n\nThe fact that you're asking this question means you're ready to take the risk. Start building something this week. Doesn't matter what. Just start.\n\nWhat skills or problems do you have that could translate to a side hustle? Happy to brainstorm if helpful.",

Data cleanup on Excel, surveys, calendar management for mid sized agencies, and a few other random things here and there.\n\nIt's not regular income and some months are better than others, but I genuinely couldn't have started on this path without that first $10 push from that random post. Once you make that first bit of money online something just shifts in how you see opportunities.\n\nI want to know what was your first source of online income because we all know starting out is the hardest part.

The most i made was 200$ for 4 hours of work, but i removed multiple 8 foot tall bushes, loaded them in my truck and did dump runs. (+ clean their yard up after)\n\nOh, I also have a truck (required lol)\n\nAll this took was creating a name, a quick description of the work I am capable of completing, and some trusting members of my community.\n\nNow, I need a business license and insurance. Ive opted for just telling people I am not a registered business and I dont have insurance, and most people are happy just to have someone there to help.\n\nSo there it is. The side hustle that I could live off of. Yard care to help my community.\n\nHonestly i love it and wish I could do it full time.\n\n",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone. I’m a 23-year-old new graduate in Canada, working full-time in a university administrative role in a sales-adjacent department. While my formal title is coordinator-level, my day-to-day work is closer to first-line operations management.\n\nI currently own my team’s logistics and inventory systems end-to- end. This includes managing physical inventory of giveaway items and company-owned tech assets, maintaining tracking and renewal cycles, managing relationships with external service providers, overseeing a small team of student staff, and having limited budget oversight. My work is very systems-, problem-solving-, and operations-focused rather than creative.\n\nBefore this role, I spent two years as a frontline manager in a student services department while studying full-time. I oversaw \\~30 student staff with hiring responsibility and limited disciplinary authority, had significant budget oversight, managed multiple stakeholder relationships (both as a service provider and as a client), and handled escalations when things broke.\n\nAcross both roles, my strengths are in systems design, process improvement, debugging operational issues, and working with real-world messy constraints. I’m entirely self-taught in this area and don’t have formal business or operations credentials beyond high school business courses.\n\nI’m looking for side hustle ideas that fit around 10 hours per week, require little upfront capital, and ideally have some path to scaling over time. I’m not particularly interested in content creation, design, or social-media-driven businesses. I’m much stronger in technical, analytical, and operations-oriented work, and would prefer to sell a service rather than a product.\n\nI also have some background in tutoring and pedagogy, but I’ve already explored that path and don’t see it as a good long-term fit for me.\n\nI’d appreciate suggestions for side hustles that align with that skill set and constraints.\n\nTIA!",

No timers, no categories, no ceremony.  \n  \nWhat’s interesting is how consistently other freelancers recognize the problem when they see it laid out like that. Not excitement, just a kind of “yeah… that’s where my hours go.”  \n  \ni really want to know how others handle this in practice.

Bookkeeping has a low barrier of entry and doesn’t pay well so you will be competing with other folks for minimal pay. This could be different in Europe tho.

Back then, the biggest hurdle for me was always setup. You either paid for development and design, or you spent a lot of time figuring everything out yourself.\n\nRecently, it feels like a lot of that initial friction has shifted because of AI. I’m seeing more AI-driven store builders that can spin up a basic site and product pages pretty quickly. I came across tools like genstore while researching, and from the outside they seem to cover a lot of what used to be manual work, at least at the starting stage.\n\nWhat I’m unsure about is whether this really lowers the overall cost of running a side hustle, or just moves the cost and effort elsewhere. It sounds great to spend less upfront on setup and more on testing products and getting traffic, but I’m wondering if there are trade-offs that only show up later, like limitations, ongoing fees, or problems scaling once things start working.\n\nFor anyone who has started an e-commerce project recently using AI tools, did it genuinely save you time and money in the early stages, or did the harder and more expensive parts just show up later in different ways?",

The idea was simple - an ad funded lottery/sweepstakes game where you don't need to spend money to play you just watch ads. The napkin math seemed solid $0.02 per ad view in the US x 5 ads per day x 100k players = $10k in prizes per day and 5% for me would be great… I released the app, made a post in this sub that blew up and so I thought I’d follow up after a year. Aside from reading the story which I’ll dump in the comments, I’d really appreciate if you could try the app and give me some classic honest reddit feedback! It’s been a bit of a side hustle but my main business dried up recently and so I either need to go all in on this, or start something new!\n\n[**https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=earn.cash.with.ad.millionaire.maker.lottery.bet**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=earn.cash.with.ad.millionaire.maker.lottery.bet)\n\n**Emojingo on Google Play (classic app)**\n\n[**https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=task.emojingo.app&amp;hl=en\\_US**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=task.emojingo.app&amp;hl=en_US)\n\n**Emojingo Tasks on Google Play (higher earnings per ad view in some countries)**\n\n[**https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emojingo-live-play-the-world/id6738431720**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emojingo-live-play-the-world/id6738431720)\n\n**Emojingo on iOS (can’t cashout via app - need to use web dashboard on emojingo.com)**\n\nHere are the Emojingo basics - each advert you watch (5-30s) adds money to the prize pool and generates a ticket for the daily prize draw that I do in TikTok Live [https://www.tiktok.com/@playemojingo](https://www.tiktok.com/@playemojingo) I then take all the money from the ad views and add it to the prize pool (minus 5% for charity and 5% for me) which I then split with the players every day. Any money that is not won, gets rolled over to the next day so we can get a range of big prizes with lower chance of winning and some smaller daily prizes.  \n  \n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/passive\\_income/comments/1gprs9k/made\\_an\\_ad\\_funded\\_lotterysweepstakes\\_app\\_emojingo/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/comments/1gprs9k/made_an_ad_funded_lotterysweepstakes_app_emojingo/)\n\n**The OG post**  \n  \nI’ll dump the rest of the story in the comments",

Moral, if you’re doing anything involving rewards or paying money to people, build it robustly with a server even for the MVP.  \n  \nI started building the user base slowly, thinking everything was covered, but some crafty hackers found the one endpoint that we didn’t lock and started exploiting it very gently so I didn’t notice at first but after a while as I couldn’t figure out why the numbers didn’t add up, I tracked him down. Turns out they had a group somewhere and so a couple of hundred people were using this exploit. When we shut them down, they went and collectively dropped a bunch of 1\\* reviews saying we were a scam and Google took down our app. No appeals helped. Moral, robust server, again  \n  \nWe restarted the app, but this time decided to add Earn into the app title because it performed and into the package name. When we started again, we noticed that our ad rates dropped, spend weeks figuring out why, until finally some random Good Samaritan at an ad network told us that Earn is a trigger warning for ad networks and they’ll either outright ban you or dump your rates. Moral, if you’re incentivising ad views in your app, be careful about it and don’t rub it into the ad networks’ face. \n\n\n\nRight around that time, I experimented with screenshots and used another app’s screenshots as inspiration for Gemini to make something similar - it left a small non-copyrighted bit in, but that was enough for another removal. Moral, be careful if you’re recreating screenshots to make sure nothing gets stuck there.  \n  \nWe somehow managed to get out of that one and the app was reinstated, but then our TikTok randomly got banned and then reinstated. People in the know said that our positioning was very lottery like, even though we don’t take any money and it’s pure ads. Moral, TikTok is super sensitive around gambling so be very careful there. Instagram doesn’t really have our target audience but YouTube is good and I suspect Facebook too. ",

          "body": "OK, so after 20+ years running businesses, here's what I've seen work consistently; ocus on building something that compounds rather than trading time for money. \n\nMost 'online hustles' are essentially freelancing in disguise. Nothing wrong with that, but you're still capped by hours available. The operators I know who built real passive income did it by solving problems they already understood (usually from their day job) and automating the solution. Takes 12-18 months to see meaningful results, however the income tends to stick around. A common pitfall; chasing whatever's trending rather than playing to your existing knowledge. Your spare time is probably better spent deepening expertise than learning dropshipping from scratch.",

Now I’m looking into trying dropshipping journey to see how this gonna turn out. The only thing about online income is to try and see if is working and then scale it .

          "body": "For me, the only online “hustle” that has consistently worked in my spare time is Attapoll. I’ve been using it for about three months, usually after work or during random downtime, and I’ve made around 60€ in total. It’s not a real side‑income, but it’s been a steady 20€ a month without needing to dedicate actual focused time to it.\n\nWhat made it worthwhile was sticking to short surveys. Anything under ten minutes tends to be reliable, while the longer ones often screen you out halfway through. I also use Google Rewards alongside it, and the small credits from there cover those little 0.99€ or 1.99€ in‑app purchases, which makes it feel like a tiny cashback system running in the background.\n\nI’ve also tried some of the game tasks on Attapoll, and here’s what actually paid out for me:\n\n• **Monopoly GO**    \nThis was the best experience. No ads, smooth progression, and daily events that keep things moving. I earned 14.44€ from it, and it never felt like a chore.\n\n• **Merge games**    \nThese were the worst. They’re packed with ads and progress slows to a crawl unless you sit through endless videos. I usually grab the first easy rewards and uninstall before it becomes a grind.\n\n• **Crypto Miner Tycoon**    \nA pleasant surprise. It’s an idle‑style game with quick daily check‑ins. I made 7.98€ in about five or six days by pushing to the level 5000 milestone, and it never felt like a time sink.\n\nSome tasks even pay instantly just for installing an app, which is obviously the easiest money you can get on there.\n\nA few habits helped me keep things efficient: I cash out as soon as I hit the minimum because payments are fast. I skip surveys that look too long for the payout, since anything over twenty minutes for cents is usually a waste of time. And I keep notifications on because the good surveys disappear quickly. Treating it as a casual side activity rather than something to grind has kept it enjoyable.\n\nOverall, Attapoll has been the only thing that fits naturally into my day without feeling like work. It won’t replace a proper side‑income, but it turns those little pockets of downtime into something mildly productive instead of mindless scrolling. If you want to try it, here’s my referral: [https://attapoll.app/join/idmbj](https://attapoll.app/join/idmbj)",

If you don’t start, you won’t even get the chance to fail or win.\n\nIf I had to start from $0 and aim for $300 in a month (online focused skills), this is what I’d do as a beginner:\n\nI’d first learn basic web concepts, not coding.

This is how it would look online.”\n\nWhen people see a finished product, the chance of buying goes way up.\n\nCharge small at first:\n$50–$100 per site\n3–6 clients = $300–$600\n\nKeep doing it, improve your approach, refine the sites, and scale toward $1000.\n\nWill it work every time?

You won't make much but it's baseline income while you build other stuff. its not much but since I have been consistent its an easy 200-$250 a month with minimal work.\n\nLearn one basic freelance skill. Virtual assistant work is probably fastest since it's mostly scheduling and emails. Watch YouTube tutorials, practice for a few days, then make a Fiverr/upwork profile. Charge low at first just to get reviews.\n\nGrind Fiverr proposals and take whatever gigs you can get. Even if it's $20-30 per gig, do 5-6 of those and you're at $100-150. Combined with survey apps getting you another $50-80, you're around $200.\n\nTo hit $300 you'd need to either land one bigger freelancing gig or sell stuff you own. The $300 range is doable in a month if you hustle. $1000 from zero is basically impossible unless you already have skills or inventory to sell.\n\nWhat skills do you have right now that could translate to freelancing?",

My father passed away, and I currently don't have a job, and I now live in his apartment. I'm 22, and I don't have a high school diploma. I've tried looking for jobs, but I haven't been getting any callbacks, and everything is very spread out where I live and hard to get to on foot, we also don't have public transportation. Unfortunately, I also think I'm being a bit picky with the jobs I'm wanting but I have mental issues that make interacting with people pretty complicated. I've been looking for remote jobs too but im not sure where else to look. So now I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I'm a digital artist, and I crochet. I've tried to make money off of them, but it never seems to stick. Hopefully, someone here can at least point me in the right direction.",

No, they won’t replace a full-time job. But honestly, they’ve helped a lot of people earn something instead of nothing during free time.\n\nFor students, people between jobs, or anyone who can’t commit to fixed working hours, these apps actually create opportunities that didn’t exist earlier. Simple tasks, small gigs, surveys, micro-work — it may look small individually, but it adds up over time.\n\nWhat I personally appreciate is:\n\nYou can work anytime, anywhere\n\nNo pressure, no boss, no deadlines\n\nEven small payouts feel motivating\n\nSome apps genuinely pay on time and transparently\n\nIn a world where earning options are often limited by qualifications, location, or experience, these apps at least open a door. You decide how much time to give and what’s worth it for you.\n\nOf course, users should stay cautious and avoid unrealistic expectations, but that doesn’t take away from the fact that many of these platforms are genuinely trying to help people earn in small, honest ways.\n\nSo yeah — just an appreciation post for platforms that respect flexible work and give people a chance to earn on their own terms. 🙌\n\nIf anyone has a paid work app they genuinely like or trust, feel free to share your experience.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n\nMake it shorter (for strict subs)\n\nAdjust it for Indian audience specifically\n\nRewrite it in a more emotional or more professional tone",

I thought carefully about the skills I have, even though there aren’t many haha: drawing and digital art, understanding what my target customers want, and decent SEO. I haven’t been able to spend a lot of time on these little shops, but I’ve already listed about 60 products, and for the past four months, I’ve been making an extra 200 dollars each month. \n\nI really enjoy this work. It’s not completely passive income, but it feels pretty close. My products are all digital downloads, like digital stationery, planners, stickers, and so on. I draw some simple designs on my iPad and then use Canva to put everything together. I use AdsPower to manage my shops separately. The income isn’t huge yet, but it’s enough to cover my bills, and I’m already super excited. I just need to put in a bit more time. I really think that as long as you find the right approach, even a competitive niche can work out. \n\nSorry I didn’t share my shop! There are plenty of videos on YouTube about selling digital products. Just find what works for you. \n\n",

      "selftext": "I finally made my first money online and it didn’t come from my “main” startup, but from a tiny side project I made in a day.\n\nOn Sunday I needed a super simple, super cheap feedback widget for my own projects. Everything I found was either buggy or way too expensive for what I needed (most “affordable” tools are still $20–$50/month for basic stuff). So I said screw it, built my own version in a day, and shared it.​\n\nPeople started calling it “the most affordable feedback tool on the internet”. Someone paid, then another… and now there are 9 paying users at a very dumb, very simple price: **1$/month per site**. So right now it’s literally 9 users → 9$/month.\n\nWhat feels crazy to me is not the money, but the timing. TrustMRR stats show that going from 0 → first dollar usually takes around 5 months on average, and I hit that “0 to 1” in a day with a side project.​\n\nA few things this taught me already:\n\n* Scratching your own itch is still underrated.\n* Charging *something* beats waiting for “the perfect launch”.\n* Simple pricing lowers the mental barrier for both builder and buyer.\n\nHappy to answer any questions about how the 9 users came in, pricing, stack, etc.",

(Passive: money works for you.)\n\n• Rental property income (with property manager): Buy property, hire management; collect rent checks ongoing. (Passive after setup.)\n\n• Royalties from a book/ebook – Write and publish once (e.g., on Amazon KDP); earn royalties on every sale forever.\n\n• Online course sales – Create and upload a course once (e.g., on Udemy or Teachable); earn from enrollments with no further work\n\n• Affiliate marketing website/blog – Build a site with evergreen content and affiliate links; earn commissions from traffic/sales over years.\n\n• YouTube channel ad revenue – Upload videos that stay relevant; earn from ads, sponsorships, and views long-term (after hitting monetization).\n• Peer-to-peer lending interest – Lend money via platforms like LendingClub; earn interest automatically as borrowers repay.\n\n• App or software license sales – Develop an app once and sell/distribute it (e.g., on app stores); earn from downloads/subscriptions.\n\n• Digital product sales (printables, stock photos, templates) – Create once and sell unlimited copies on Etsy or your site.\n• High-yield savings or CD interest – Deposit money in interest-bearing accounts; earn passively with zero effort.\n• Domain name parking/flipping – Buy valuable domains and park them with ads or sell later for profit.\n\nClicking vague links from sketchy folks phishing for morons here 24/7 will NOT lead you to success in passive income. \n",

Here is what I’ve learned about the '$10/day' mindset:\n\n1. **Don't 'Work' for $10, Build for it:** If you spend 2 hours a day on a survey, you get $10 once. If you spend 2 hours building a Pinterest or Reddit presence, that content stays online and works for you 24/7.\n2. **The 'Leaky Bucket' Problem:** I just discovered I was 'leaking' traffic. I had 105 clicks to offers but $0 revenue because I wasn't capturing emails first. $10/day comes easily once you fix your 'routing.'\n3. **Start with Value:** Pick a niche you know, post helpful data on Reddit or Quora, and link to a resource.\n\nI’m documenting every failure and pivot of my 90-day build-in-public journey on my profile. It’s currently at $0, but the 'plumbing' is now doing 18k views. Happy to show you the 'architecture' if you want to see how to aim higher than $10!",

You make designs once, they sit there, and you get a small cut when someone buys. Won't make much but it's truly passive after the initial upload.\n\nFor online surveys, it's not really passive since you're actively doing tasks. But if you're okay with that, surveys can get you $10-20/month for minimal effort. I make around $300 from them on a monthly basis since I end up doing them almost everyday during my commute to work so it does feel low effort cuz I am not taking time out of my day to do them.

You already understand shipping workflows, which is a big advantage. Check Upwork / Fiverr but position yourself as operations support, not “VA.”\n* Local service arbitrage:Dubai has high demand for cleaning, moving, handyman, car detailing, etc. You don’t do the work — you just: run ads, handle WhatsApp inquiries, book jobs, take a margin, Very doable evenings/weekends.\n* B2B outreach for small companies:Many SMEs here are terrible at email/LinkedIn outreach. Learning basic cold email + lead lists can turn into a retainer side income within a few months.\n* Longer-term (not passive at first): digital products or contentIf your goal is “something of your own,” build in public slowly (blog, X, Reddit) around a niche you actually know (shipping, expat life, ops, logistics). Monetization comes later.\nBiggest advice: Avoid anything marketed as “passive” upfront. Almost nothing is. Focus on skills or leverage first, then make it passive later.",

I want to be smart about timing. My personal goal is consistent monthly income plus an emergency buffer but part of me wonders if you ever truly feel ready.\n\nFor those who actually made the leap what flipped the switch for you?  \nWas it hitting a number seeing a trend you trusted or realizing staying in your job felt worse than the risk of leaving? And looking back what do you wish you had known before going full time?",

Pay isn't amazing but it's legitimate and flexible. If you can write decently, content writing through platforms like Contently or Textbroker is an option too, though the pay per word is pretty low when you're starting out.\n\nFor tech, if you know any coding, Toptal or Upwork are solid for contract work but the competition is brutal and you need a strong portfolio. Honestly the biggest filter is just avoiding anything that asks for money upfront or promises crazy returns. If it sounds too good it probably is.

That's long-haul investing. If you reinvest dividends and choose wisely it could be substantial 10-20 years from now.\n\nTrading requires a lot of attention with lots of ups and downs.

I just said that cus that is where I am I dunno how much I'm Australian or whatever. The second one is three times longer so 72 days 3 hours a day or half that at 6 hours a day take a $350 test and that puts you in the $150,000 to $220,000 a year range after your third year of work. So he puts a ceiling of 220,000 and then you get a job making $50 to $90 and then you get that cert while you're working that 50 to 90 job and within 2 years you're going to be making $150k to $220k as a junior and senior level worker  and it sounds crazy but your second second cert lets you become eventually a senior level worker in that field and it usually takes like 3 years to become a senior level. You'd be a junior level associate like in a year and a half to 2 years and then by year three you could be making senior level pay which is $220 plus stock options and benefits. But the tech industry needs millions of people right now because of AI. And you don't need to have any computer knowledge to take these certs or to start learning them. No computer knowledge, no code knowledge, no math. It's ridiculous. It's like a dream come true to be honest",

I am in charge of my food and other necessities, and I don’t want to bother my parents with additional school fees because they are already paying for my room, my tuition, and giving me an allowance every week. I do not wish to add to their burden anymore.\n\nTo be honest, I barely eat sometimes just so I can save money for school supplies and fees. There are days when I choose to skip meals because I know there will be expenses coming up, and I don’t want to ask for more. I try to stretch what little I have as much as I can.\n\nI can’t find any jobs online, and I can’t work at fast-food restaurants since my schedule is very loaded. I also can’t do physical labor because of my poor physical health. I am a regular university student, but I think I can make time at night and cut some of my study sessions to work. I am very eager to find a side hustle, but I can’t seem to get hired.\n\nHow do people actually find online side hustles? What are some side hustles you can suggest for someone in my situation?

We are moving away from the \"signal room\" hype and focusing on data-driven probabilities.\n\nWe’ve decided to skip paid ads (too much noise/high CAC in the trading niche) and go all-in on a \"Nano-Affiliate\" strategy. \n\nWe’re targeting creators with 500–20,000 followers who have high trust.\n\nTo get these small creators to care, I’m offering a 60% recurring monthly commission. My logic is that since the LTV is high and our overhead is capped, I’d rather give the lion's share to the person who brought the customer in, creating a \"sticky\" partnership.\nFor the experienced affiliate marketers here:\nDoes 60% sound \"too good to be true\"? Does a commission that high actually scare away professional affiliates because they think the business isn't sustainable?\n\nWe use Whop for our backend to ensure transparent tracking/payouts. In your experience, do affiliates prefer 3rd-party platforms like Whop? \n\nIf you were a small creator, what would you need to see besides the commission? (e.g., Live data audits, \"swipe files,\" \"documents/white paper\" or a free account to verify the tool ourselves?)\n\nI'm trying to build this lean and partner-focused. I'd love to hear from anyone who has successfully built a similar affiliate-first business.",

Paid ads are expensive and going after small creators with engaged audiences is a great idea. \n\nTo answer your question, you won't know until you try. \n\n60% is generous.

Get it out in front of as many affiliates as you can, and they will negotiate, reject you, or try it out. \n\nThe game doesn't really start until they have the live offer and are able to measure the CVR. \n\nFor the record, I plan on copying your approach (for LATAM market) and won't even bother with rev share.

      "selftext": "So here’s the story.\n\nI was looking at some car accessories and kept seeing the same products priced at what felt like a crazy markup. Out of curiosity, I started digging into Alibaba to see what the actual manufacturing cost looked like. After a decent amount of research into suppliers, reviews, and verifying the manufacturer, I pulled the trigger on one unit.\n\nWhen it arrived, I was honestly expecting stereotypical cheap Chinese knockoff quality. But it wasn’t. The build quality was on par with the name-brand US versions I’d been comparing it to.\n\nJust for fun, I threw it up on Facebook Marketplace to see if there was any interest. The response surprised me. My all-in cost including shipping was around $1,200. Comparable products were selling locally for $2,500+. I had multiple inquiries within days.\n\nSo now I’m testing it for real. Bought a few more units, planning to flip them. If it works, I’ll open an LLC and do everything above board.\nHere’s where my background helps: I work in logistics, so I’ve been able to optimize shipping and cut some costs that I think most people wouldn’t know how to avoid. I’m wondering if that gives me a legitimate edge, or if this whole space is so saturated that margins get crushed the moment you try to scale.\n\nMy questions for this community:\n\n\t∙\tIs the “Alibaba to local resale” model played out, or are there still niches where this works?\n\t∙\tDid I just get lucky with this particular product category, or is there a repeatable process here?\n\t∙\tFor those who’ve done this: what’s the capital requirement to actually make it a real business vs. a side hustle?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s tried this, whether it worked or didn’t. Not looking for validation; just trying to figure out if this is worth pursuing seriously or if I should just enjoy the quick wins and move on.",

          "body": "I do a ton of sourcing and importing as a service. I work with basically the future version of you, companies who already have sales to justify volume. Just for context anyway.\n\n\\- Is Alibaba to local played out?\n\nNo. But it's less about the business structure and more about what type of product actually sells locally, is there used versions available locally, and how to play it off. For some products, yes, it's played out. Maybe not having anything to do with it coming from Alibaba, vs maybe just there is a lot of competition on Marketplace with just used ones. Or, there just isn't the demand. Be careful with just getting interest. Marketplace is natorious for tons of people asking if it's still available, but not ultimately selling it. I don't know why, just how people behave on the platform.\n\n\n\n\\- Did you get lucky?\n\nI guess I wouldn't know. I don't know that luck has much to do with business. You took a chance and it paid off (Assuming it sold, I didn't catch if it did or not)\n\n\n\n\\- Is there a repeatable process?\n\nI'm assuming you mean, can you repeat this with other products? The answer is basically the first question. It depends on your local dynamics. \n\n  \n\\- Is there a real business here?\n\nNo, it's a side hustle. It won't scale. Meaning, to make more money, you have to work harder. There is very little you can do to change that. And you will have to continue essentially finding entirely new products to take that chance on as the old ones get local market saturation.\n\n That's not to say it's  not worth pursuing for the fun, experience and maybe side cash. But what this does do is ties your time and money up on something with limited potential. If you don't have a lot of entrepreneurial dreams, this is fine. But if you do have those dreams, aside from this being a good learning experience, it's what will keep you from those dreams. It absolutely will hold your entrepreurial dreams back if you ever wanted to have something less side hustle and more full on scalable business.\n\n\n\n\\- Does your logistics background help?\n\nAbsolutely. A lot of people that get into reselling, regardless of the platform. They have cost prohibitive freight costs. If you have solved that problem, you are ahead of the curve no matter what you do. It essentially adds a layer of competitive advantage on landed cost. At least as far as you can have with shipping so few. But judging by the price point, I am assuming the CBM is relatively large. Meaning shipping just a few can still be above the first tier of economies of scale. Of course if you ship a whole container at once, or at least the more CBM the lower the cost. But if your outlet is marketplace, that probably isn't a possibility. Then it becomes filling that CBM with multiple different products. But honestly, I don't see that being a good business if your outlet is just market place. You might be better off actually starting a brand where you have a site and try to get distribution. Just the larger the item, the harder that gets because of the then shippng cost to the end user. But, still maybe worth looking into.\n\n\n\n\\- LLC?\n\nNo, don't do this until you have proven there is enough sales to justify. You are selling on a platform known for buying used things. You are selling them as an individual. You don't have nearly the level of reason to protect yourself as someone really needing that LLC or whatever structure. Of course you still report the income as pass-through, so you are legit enough. If you go into selling serious volume, then yes. But at this level, it's a hard not-worth-it.",

It works for sure, but the real question is how long you gonna stay ahead.\n\nThis thing is super saturated, so finding a niche is something you hold close to your chest. There’s a ton of VA’s  and full time resellers who literally spend all day scrolling Facebook Marketplace looking for the exact same deals you’re chasing.\n\nHere’s what usually happens. You’ll knock out five units quick at $2,500 each and feel like you just discovered fire. Then all of a sudden nothing moves. Next thing you know, the same item shows up from somebody else at $2,300. You drop yours to $2,200 to keep selling. They go lower. You go lower again.\n\nPretty soon you’re in a full on race to the bottom and eating your own profits.\n\nSo your real edge is gonna be that logistical experience on the import side. Mind if I ask you some questions regarding logistics? \n\nWhen ordering from Alibaba and scaling up, what are some of the specific tricks you’re using to keep shipping and import costs low that most beginners totally miss? Like smarter freight choices, consolidation, duty stuff, or anything else that’s actually saving you money and helping protect those margins?\n\nInterested in learning more.

I don’t have friendships. I don’t have that university life where people talk, hang out, and share experiences Most of my time I just sit doing nothing I feel empty and far away from people my age.\nI started thinking maybe I should use the money to study abroad (I’m in Saudi) on my own just to “live” and not waste my youth but at the same time I need to manage the car wash.\nAny advice from entrepreneurs who’ve been through something like this? Or had that same sense of emptiness? What would you do if you were in my position?",

Most of the times the feeling passes but if it lingers you may need to think inward and explore what your true passions are in life and pursue them. \n\nI went from climbing and cutting to management lately and grew very unhappy and complacent in work and life. Always feeling like something was missing. I found out that went away when I actually got out and did tree work which is my passion. I did more exploring within myself and realized I love helping others so I started another tree service (non-profit) that helps people at subsidized or no cost. \n\nIn conclusion, find out what you have a true passion for whether it’s in work or a hobby and let that bring you fulfillment and joy. The car wash may just be income but don’t give up on it. If you can find joy in other parts of your life the negative feelings about the car wash will go away. From one stranger to another I am incredibly proud of you for starting a business and I wish you success!\n\nYou need to travel. This will help some of the feelings you have but don’t lose sight of your business. Also, consider getting a mentor or a psychologist/therapist. This can help sort through your thoughts and come to your own conclusions. See the car wash through, scale it, hire employees that can run it without you but don’t stop managing the business. You’ve made a commitment to your dad and yourself. See it through.",

Several people have suggested here to join a group of entrepreneurs to learn from them, which I think is a great idea. You will meet others in the same place in life, although you'll most likely be the youngest. I think you could, from this point, begin a journey of accumulating assets, which will help get you separated out in a good way, to a place of financial independence. Learn about real estate, for example, and all of the different ways to make money with residential properties. Read the book Rich Dad, Poor Dad. There's this woman, Codie Sanchez, who has a PhD, worked on Wall Street, and now owns a portfolio of businesses. This video is about doing exactly that: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtS8rOAqoM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtS8rOAqoM), and she teaches you how to approach owners to buy their business, using their money. It's called owner financing. It would be worthwhile to listen to her life journey, too. Keep your chin up and go at your own pace. I'm excited for you!",

I would suggest applying yourself to growing your business and/or expanding.  Obviously, you want to save up a reserve of cash and pay down your loan (early, if you can) but also maybe save up to purchase your next business or expand your existing one.  If people are waiting for their car to get washed, you have a captive audience so you might be able to add retail like coffee, juice, snacks, car accessories, etc.  \n\nAlso, I don't know how it is in Saudi, but in the US as a business owner your are part of a special club of business owners.  Other business owners will likely talk to you and treat you as an equal.  Go around to the businesses near you (and any others you are interested in) and ask for the owner and introduce yourself.  Say \"My name is Joe Bob and I own the car wash down the street and I just wanted to introduce myself.\"  You will probably be surprised that they will likely be happy to show you around their business and talk business with you, even direct competitors.  You can make a lot of friends this way and do a lot of business networking.  Also, try to get to know the owners of your suppliers if they are local or find local suppliers whose owners you can know personally.\n\nAnd you can hang out with your employees, just try to keep business separate.  Take the crew out for a few drinks or pizza or something after closing, have company picnics or BBQ's, etc. Invite their families.",

      "selftext": "I just finished watching Alex's new \"26 Lessons\" video. It’s long, but honestly, there were some gems in there that hit pretty hard. I took notes for myself and figured I’d drop them here to save you guys the time.\n\nHere you go:\n\n**On Mindset &amp; Psychology**\n\n* **Fear lives in the vague.** If you’re scared, write down the absolute worst-case scenario in detail. Usually, it’s just \"sleeping on a friend's couch,\" not dying. Once it’s on paper, it’s not scary.\n* **Mental Toughness &gt; Motivation.** He breaks toughness down into: How much bad stuff can you take? How low do you get? How fast do you bounce back? And do you come back better?\n* **The \"Heavyweight Champion\" move is doing nothing.** When someone insults you or triggers you, your gut wants to punish them. But usually, doing nothing is the only move that actually gets you what you want (them going away).\n* **Think for yourself.** Most people are just picking \"identity packages\" off the shelf (Hipster, Redneck, etc) and adopting those beliefs. If you can't explain why you believe something, it's not your thought.\n* **It's okay to just make money.** Don't fall for the \"Third Marshmallow\" trap where you delay gratification until you're dead. At some point, you have to reap what you sowed.\n\n**On Business Strategy &amp; Growth**\n\n* **No \"New\" Stuff.** New is risky. The hierarchy is: Do **More** of what works &gt; Do it **Better** \\&gt; Do something **New** (only as a last resort). He only allows himself one new big project a year.\n* **Plan life first.** Once you have money, you’re paid for judgment, not hours. So prioritize sleep and an empty calendar. Let business fill the cracks, not the other way around.\n* **Ignorance isn't a defense.** Learn the laws and contracts. \"Lawyer stuff\" eats your brainpower if you don't understand the rules of the game.\n* **The Founder's Will.** The biggest risk isn't running out of cash, it's the founder just not wanting to do it anymore. You need a \"why\" that survives past the point where the money is \"enough.\"\n\n**On Team &amp; Leadership (The harsh truths)**\n\n* **The Leader is always the problem.** If a department sucks, the leader sucks. Period.\n* **A-Players or nothing.** You know if someone is an A-Player in the first 14 days. If you don't know by then, they aren't one. Cut them.\n* **A-Players hate B-Players.** If you keep mediocre people, your stars will leave.\n* **Hard conversations save millions.** If you can't have a tough talk when stakes are low (contracts), you guarantee a lawsuit when stakes are high.\n* **Delegation is painful.** The spiritual path of entrepreneurship is constantly giving up control. \"Scale Zero\" means if a task requires you, it’s broken.\n\n**On Marketing &amp; Brand**\n\n* **The Offer is King.** You can't out-market a bad offer. A good offer makes people feel stupid saying no. (Razor: Can you pitch it in a text message and get a \"yes\"? If not, it's too complex).\n* **Clear &gt; Clever.** No one is listening. You have to repeat yourself until you die.\n* **Brand is the Moat.** In an AI world, execution is commoditized. Who people trust is the only defense. Give away the secrets, sell the implementation.\n* **Volume wins.** You need thousands of ad creatives. He used like 5,000 variations for his book launch.\n\nP.S. Add yours - let's make a mega thread which is packed with value for all.",

Customers would make less impulsive purchases. It slows the whole system down for the store as there is a choke point. More product returns. If you look at grocery, it's mostly large chains with few employees and instead it's the distributers stocking the shelves, and that's why you can't get someone to help you and when they do they said \"i don't work here, sorry.\"  Grocery is mostly a real estate business today. An exception is Trader Joes which is a completely different model but you still pick it yourself. Incidentally, trading stores in the US worked the way you describe in 1800s before the modern grocery store was invented. You would go to the counter and tell the man what you wanted to buy. If you are interested in this topic, there's an episode of the Acquired podcast about Trader Joes that is fascinating.",

Staying out of stores and doing the pickup option for convenience became very popular during Covid, but near the end of Covid, people were ready to get out and back into stores. This divided customer base made omnichannel shopping far more important. People appreciated the option to walk around and browse, but there were some people who wanted to strictly purchase what they wanted and needed without the hassle of going into stores and possibly buying things they didn’t intend impulsively. \n\nAll this leads me to believe that AR/VR shopping is going to be a big middle ground once the tech catches up and becomes convenient enough for consumers to wear the displays and shop either with AR rendered 3D models in their own homes or via a full VR shopping experience where the customer could effectively “pilot” a robot shopper to walk the aisles and shop. Then, to save on labor costs, items that are purchased with be picked and packed by other robotics either for pickup or delivery. Amazon has had a patent on a massive drone warehouse for a while now where the orders would be picked and shipped from this warehouse blimp via drone delivery.

      "selftext": "I've seen hundreds of pitch decks, met dozens of founders in 2025, and made dozens of pitch decks. Talked to many investors and asked their insights about pitch decks for whole year. Here is what I learned this year:\n\n1. **The problem slide is where you win or lose.** If an investor doesn't lean forward on slide 2, the rest doesn't matter. Most founders bury their best insight on slide 8.\n2. **Founders who've experienced the problem they're solving tell better stories.** Personal connection &gt; market research every single time.\n3. **The \"platform\" word is poison.** I removed it from at least 10 decks this year. Just tell me what the thing actually does.\n4. **Traction without context is useless.** \"10K users\" means nothing. \"10K users, 23% MoM growth, $47 average revenue per user\" means something.\n5. **Most market size slides are bullshit, and investors know it.** TAM/SAM/SOM with numbers pulled from Statista doesn't impress anyone. Show me YOUR math based on YOUR customer segments.\n6. **Financial projections are fiction, but they reveal how you think.** Show you understand unit economics and investors will forgive aggressive growth assumptions. Show hockey sticks with no underlying logic and investors will assume you don't know your business.\n7. **The team slide should answer \"why you, why now.\"** Your advisor's LinkedIn profile doesn't matter. Your 10 years solving this exact problem does.\n8. **Asking for money without showing what milestones is just amateur.** \"We need $2M for hiring and marketing\" isn't a plan. \"$2M gets us to $100K MRR and 18-month runway\" is.\n9. **Design matters less than founders think, but more than they act like it does.** Your deck doesn't need to be gorgeous, but it can't look like you don't give a shit.\n10. **Every deck should answer: what's the insight only you have?** If I could've thought of your idea without domain expertise, it's not compelling enough.\n11. **Slide count doesn't matter.** Based on my experience and Carta's insights, there's no correlation between slide number and fundraising success. If a slide is meaningful, keep it. If a slide is just \"nice to have,\" remove it.\n12. **Founders confuse features with benefits.** \"AI-powered matching algorithm\" doesn't mean shit to anyone. \"Cuts hiring time from 60 days to 12\" does.\n13. **The fundraising story matters as much as the business story.** Why this round, why this amount, why now etc. If you can't articulate it clearly, investors smell desperation.\n14. **The decks that got funded weren't perfect but they were clear.** Clarity beats cleverness every single time.\n15. **Nobody reads Slide 1 (Cover slide).** They glance at it for 3 seconds. If your tagline is a paragraph, you've already lost.\n16. **\"AI\" is a feature, not a business.** In Q1 2025, slapping \"AI\" on a slide worked. Now? It's noise. Tell me what problem you solve, not what tech stack you use.\n17. **The \"Conservative Estimate\" Lie.** We know your Year 5 projection of $100M ARR is fake. You know it's fake. Focus on how you get the first $1M instead of giving huge promises.\n18. **One idea per slide.** I see founders trying to cram the Problem, Solution, and Market Size onto one slide to \"save space.\" Don't. It looks like a random note.\n19. **Your TAM is wrong.** If you claim your Total Addressable Market is \"The Global Internet,\" you don't know who your customer is. Niche down.\n20. **Font size 10 is illegal.** If an investor has to squint to read your LTV/CAC ratio on a mobile screen, they're closing the file.\n21. **Bullet points are boring.** Use icons, use charts, use big numbers. Walls of text are for legal contracts, not pitch decks.\n22. **Stop using \"Uber for X.\"** It's almost 2026. Come up with your own category.\n23. **The Appendix is your best friend.** Keep the main deck short and tell your story clearly. Put the technical deep dives in the appendix.\n24. **PDF is the only format.** Don't send a Keynote. Don't send a PPT. Fonts break. Layouts shift. Send a PDF.\n25. **Your \"Exit Strategy\" is presumptuous.** You haven't sold one unit yet. Don't tell me about your IPO plans.\n26. **Data needs context.** Don't just show a graph going up. Label the axes. Explain the spike. Everybody love labeled axes.\n27. **Consistency signals competence.** If your headers jump around and your colors shift slightly, investors subconsciously think your code is messy too.\n28. **Frameworks kill the story.** Most founders try to use famous frameworks. But those frameworks push founders to be standard. Instead of this, create your own story.\n29. **Competition slide is your positioning.** Everybody knows you cannot compete with Google, Apple, OpenAI or other big corporates. But you really can focus a niche and grow in a vertical. You don't have to write a complex competition slide. X-Y landscape is great but you have to choose the right X and Y angles and be perfect on your niche.\n30. **Don't separate \"Why Now\" into its own slide.** Weave it naturally into your problem (it's urgent), market (it's shifting), and competition (giants are slow). When \"why now\" is isolated, it feels forced.\n\n**My predictions for 2026:**\n\n**AI will review your deck before humans do.** I've talked to investors and many of them are already using AI reviews, custom GPTs, Claude, Gemini on their emails. Your pitch deck isn't just for humans anymore. You need to explain your business to AI too. Find the balance: clear enough for AI to understand, compelling enough for humans to care.\n\n**Pre-seed rounds will get harder.** Building an MVP is easier than ever thanks to AI. So investors are asking for revenue or real traction even at pre-seed, and their bar will keep rising. My advice? Generate traction first, fundraise later -when it is possible of course. (And possible doesn't mean \"if you have money\", it means \"if it is possible as technical\")\n\n**Investor outreach will be noisier than ever.** Automation tools are everywhere now. Anyone can build a bulk email campaign to investors. Standing out will require actual creativity, not just another cold email template. The spray-and-pray approach is literally dead.",

          "body": "Great list. As a VC, there are 3 critical slides that are either missing or weak in almost every deck I see right now.\n\n1. The \"Why Now\" (Beyond just \"AI\") Every single deck in 2025 says \"Why Now? -&gt; Because GenAI made it possible.\" While true, it is no longer a differentiator. It’s table stakes. I see 50 decks a week claiming this. To stand out, you need a second-order \"Why Now.\" Is there a regulatory shift? A generational behavior change? A collapse of a legacy incumbent's business model? If your only catalyst is \"LLMs exist,\" you are competing with everyone.\n\n2. Distribution &gt; Product Most founders spend 10 slides on the product and 1 generic slide saying \"We will do SEO and Ads.\" In 2026, building product is easy (thanks to AI). Distribution is the hard part. I don't care how pretty the UI is; show me you understand how to acquire a customer for $1 before you extract $3.\n\n3. \"Pain Validation\" with Real Data Don't just tell me the market is big. Prove the pain is acute. Market research reports are nice, but your own data is king. Show me the results of 50 customer interviews. Better yet show me a \"Fake Door\" test where you ran $100 of ads to a landing page describing the problem. Did they click? Did they try to sign up? \"We think people want this\" &lt; \"We have a 3% CTR on cold traffic targeting this specific pain point.\"",

The decks that actually helped execution were the ones that made priorities obvious and cut the fluff. When someone can’t explain how they get to the first real milestone, everything downstream gets messy fast. The AI point is interesting too, we already feel that pressure writing things so systems and reviewers don’t misinterpret them.",

A lot of founders are still building decks for how fundraising used to work, not how it works now.\n\nTwo things I would add from recent conversations:\n\nFirst, investors are pattern matching faster than ever. That makes clarity even more important. If your insight is not obvious in the first two slides, you do not get the benefit of the doubt anymore. The deck is no longer a conversation starter. It is a filter.\n\nSecond, distribution thinking is starting to leak into decks. I have seen more investors ask “how do you get your first 100 customers” instead of “how big is the market.” Founders who can explain one repeatable acquisition motion get taken more seriously than founders with beautiful TAM math.\n\nStrong callout on AI reviewing decks too. I have seen partners admit they skim AI summaries before opening the PDF. If your story is not legible to a machine, it probably is not legible to a tired human either.\n\nOverall takeaway I agree with: decks do not need to be impressive. They need to be precise.",

          "body": "Hi there - thanks for this list. Very helpful. I have a background in business storytelling and presentations and have thought about starting a side business helping founders uncover and effectively communicate their story. A couple questions: 1) Does a storytelling approach help founders connect on an emotional level with investors and therefore lead to more success? I.e. if you lean in to problem/conflict/emotion/story, is that what pulls in the potential investor, vs going granular on product features, etc.? Or do investors mainly care about the numbers? 2) I have recommended presenters create two decks - a presentation deck (minimal text, more visual) and a leave behind deck that summarizes the presentation and can be consumed on its own. Do you consider that a best practice? Or with AI reviewing decks first, do you need to have just one deck?",

      "selftext": "Ive been freelancing as a web designer for about 2 years and I just finished a pretty big project for a client ,small ecommerce site, it took me like 6 weeks total. We had a clear contract, milestones, everything seemed professional. Delivered the final version three weeks ago, client approved everything, paid the final invoice. Since then ive gotten probably 8 emails asking for quick changes or one small adjustment that would only take a few minutes. First it was changing some button colors. Then it was adding a new section to the homepage. Then it was reworking the entire navigation menu because they had a better idea. Each time I politely remind them that the project is complete and any additional work would require a new contract or hourly rate. The thing is, these small changes add up. Ive probably spent another 4-5 hours total on these requests because I feel guilty saying no, but now im realizing im just working for free and setting a bad precedent. How do you guys handle this without damaging the relationship? I want to be firm but also don't want them leaving bad reviews or telling people I'm difficult to work with. Im also dealing with some annoying admin stuff right now since im based internationally and trying to get a proper commercial address sorted for my US business setup. Apparently its needed for some verification stuff. Anyway, any advice on the scope creep situation would be helpful cause im getting real tired of quick favors.",

That's a huge milestone.\n\n\n\nFor the documentation/invoicing:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Quick wins:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Use Wave or FreshBooks (both have free tiers) - they generate professional invoices in 5 minutes. Include: invoice number, your business details, itemized breakdown of services, payment terms (Net 30 is standard for corporate), total.\n\n\n\n\\- For what you spent their money on: Create a simple expense report in Google Sheets. Columns: Date, Category (Software, Services, Marketing, etc.), Description, Amount. Attach receipts if you have them. Corporate clients love transparency.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The systems part:\\*\\*\n\nThey're not expecting enterprise-level operations from a 2-year-old service business. They're expecting:\n\n1. Clear communication about what you're doing\n\n2. Regular updates on progress \n\n3. Proper billing (see above)\n\n4. Basic contract/SOW for future work\n\n\n\nIf they're asking about \"systems,\" they probably mean: Do you track time? Do you have project management? Do you have a process? Simple answer: Yes, you use \\[insert Notion/Trello/Monday - even if you just set it up\\]. The important part is showing you're organized, not that you're using enterprise software.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Pro tip:\\*\\* After you send them the report, follow up in 2 days and ask if they need anything clarified. This shows you're professional and gives you a chance to address concerns before they become issues.",

          "body": "Great question! For some context,  I run a small startup with a team of about 5 people and we just crossed a million in ARR this past year! AI has been immensely helpful in keeping our team lean and moving faster as a small team! People are often surprised when we say we only have 2 engineers! That said, below is a list of what worked and what did not\n\n**What worked**\n\n1. **Writing Code got 2x faster atleast:** Thanks to tools like Cursor, Windsurf etc, our team is shipping code atleast 2x faster! Metrics like DORA clearly show this but more important, its super obvious because our product roadmap for the whole year was done in the the 2nd quarter!\n2. **50% marketing is on autopilot:** Our primary marketing channel is Google ads and I still do everything manually but there were a lot of smaller marketing tasks like SEO and social media content we have been juggling with using freelancers years! Thanks to AI tools like Frizerly and stuff, all of this is completely automated now! I just spend 5 mins reviewing content every week now\n3. **Design:** Tools like Google Nano Banana, V0 by Vercel has completely taken over designs for us. AI is able to take existing simple images, UI etc and transform it into the exact ones we want! Since you can basically chat with these, iteration speed is insane!\n4. **Translation:** Lastly, we were hiring translators again as freelancers earlier because our specific business has a lot of translation requirements often! AI has been able to completely automate this again\n\n**What did not work for us**\n\n1. **Personalized outreach:** We tried outreach via LinkedIn and email using AI personalization tools but our customers hated it!\n2. **AI support:** We connected our support chat/ticket system with AI in the hopes of faster resolution and lower overall human support load! But for some reason, again our customers hate it. We kept seeing messages like \"I WANT HUMAN\" lol! So we quickly removed it\n\nFollowing to see  what everyone else experiences have been like :)",

          "body": "One big learning from adopting AI is that it doesn’t replace fundamentals, it just amplifies them. Tools help with speed, but results still come from innovation, scalability, and staying connected to real users.\n\nAI is most useful when paired with fast iteration and validated learning. It makes shipping and testing easier, but customer feedback still matters more than intuition.\n\nAnother takeaway is that AI doesn’t remove the need to understand your ideal customer. Generating things faster only works when the output is actually valuable to the right people.\n\nAnd even with all the automation, communities still matter. Trust, relationships, and real conversations continue to be where clarity and momentum come from. AI helps execute, but humans still decide what’s worth building.",

          "body": "What did help us a lot;  \n\\- Translation in a true local tone of voice got much easier. We have a multilingual content publishing platform and the automated translations are almost always spot on. Its great you can add context and tone of voice prompts with every bit of translation. Quality has gotten up by a terrible lot and time to review very much down. \n\n\\- We sell products and a new product section \"what do actual clients say\" is way better now I can summarize all reviews into one good one. New customers like this new created content block a lot and the results make a lot of sense. So instead of reading 100 reviews most customers read that piece of content. \n\nIn 2026 we're going to do the same with \"what our experts say\" and just do a survey among all our experts and summarize it automatically. Its a great way to crowdsource new quality content. \n\n\\- Grading of lead quality. The context from leads (especially the written notes) is analyzed and returns a \"hotness rating\" for the lead which prioritizes our outbound calling. This works perfect, before we could only do this prioritization on hard data (page, product, etc) and now also on written text \"I'm in the market to buy xxx and saw this on your website\". Big win.\n\n\\- Saving on legal costs; LLM's write pretty good legal documents. So nowadays we pay mostly just for reviewing and not so much for writing all pieces. It did cut costs down. But my expectation is that legal firms will cut their prices at some point and generate these themselves (but still, costs down).  \n\n\nWhat didn't work out;  \n\\- Client support; the amount of hallucinations are way too much to let the current AI converse with our clients. Too many wrong answers even though everything is correct in the knowledge base. No matter how we structured data, answers were wrong. It worked well as a context to JSON query converter, but it was lacking the actual intelligence part.",

          "body": "We used in our restaurant chain AI assistant which was specifically developed for restaurants. It spoke around 80 hours in a month so we saved around 2400-2600$ per month, which is around 30k per year. Considering our margin of 30%ish, to net that amount of profit we would have needed to sell around 90,000$ of burgers, and it is now I consider as a \"free money\" we pocket in a year. \n\nWe felt that a lot of people are just calling to ask basic stuff, and  when our cashier wasnt able to pick up the phone, all of their complaints or questions went directly to Yelp and downgrade our reviews. We did not put a cheese in the burger and we got 1 star review on yelp. That AI we are using it asks the questions to customer and even does discounts on the next visit which goes directly to our system. It gathers basic info for catering and sets up a call with a manager. They actually provided us a mini SaaS dashboard with CRM database of our clients who actually called us several times and with complaint history.\n\nWe were very sceptic but we gave it a shot. Now I am so surprised that there are many restaurants they are not using it thinking the customers will hang up the phone, but that was not true if you choose a right one. There are a lot of crappy ones out there. Choose only who are specialized in your industry. The one we are using came with a lot of automations, so always ask if they are just providing only talking with customers function or anything else. We also \"trained\" our customers to call us and place an order through phone. During rush hour we figured that people who take a car and hit highway won't go to a website and order from there. So they call and place an order not getting distracted while they are driving.  We got monthly around 10-15k of orders placed like that\n\nMy biggest learning was not to be sceptic and always be up to date with the technology. Eventually everyone will get used to AI as we did to PC and Internet.",

Lately we’ve been using an AI tool that turns raw video into SOPs and it’s actually working.

      "selftext": "If you are in your late teens or early twenties, chances are you have felt it: a quiet but persistent sense that life is slipping by without real direction. You have ambitions like achieving financial freedom, building a family one day, giving back through charity, or simply having deep, reliable friendships. But somehow, the drive to make those things happen fades quickly. Motivation comes in waves, and the only time you feel truly alive and excited is during short escapes that leave you emptier afterward. You know you should get serious, start building habits, and chase what matters, but purpose feels out of reach. You are not alone in this. Millions of young people today wrestle with the same emptiness, and there is a clear reason why it has become so common.\n\nSomething fundamental changed around the early 2000s. Before that time, most people discovered their interests through living. You would go out into the world, experience something directly, feel a spark of curiosity, and then actively seek out more information using whatever tools existed. Schools, conversations with mentors, libraries, trial and error. Your path felt self-directed because it grew naturally from your own encounters and choices. You ended up where you were because you chose to go there.\n\nToday the flow runs in the opposite direction. Information floods toward you constantly through phones and screens, carefully selected and pushed by algorithms, companies, and hidden agendas. Interests are handed to you ready-made instead of discovered through experience. Attention gets captured before you even decide what you care about. Over time, this reverses the natural order: curated content shapes your desires, pulls your focus outward, and leaves you in a life that often feels like it belongs to someone else. The constant noise drowns out your own voice, making it hard to know what you truly want or why anything matters.\n\nThis reversal explains the widespread feeling of being stuck. When everything competes for your attention, nothing feels worth giving it to. Quick dopamine hits from scrolling, gaming, or other escapes become the only reliable source of excitement because they are designed to deliver instant reward. Meanwhile, the slower rewards of building skills, relationships, or long-term goals feel distant and uncertain. Purpose requires space, reflection, and ownership, but the modern environment leaves little room for any of those.\n\nThe way out starts with reclaiming control, one small step at a time. Begin by creating quiet moments each day to listen to yourself. Ask basic questions: What activities absorb me completely? What kind of person do I respect and want to become? Write the answers down honestly. This simple habit cuts through the external chatter and helps you reconnect with your inner direction.\n\nFrom there, pick one small action that moves you toward a goal you care about and do it daily. Ten minutes of reading about money management if financial freedom matters to you. A short walk or workout if you want to feel stronger. Consistency builds momentum far better than occasional bursts of effort. When distractions pull you away, notice it without harsh judgment and gently return to what you chose.\n\nSeek real-world connections that support growth. Join groups, clubs, or online communities built around shared interests. Show up as yourself, contribute, and listen. Authentic friendships and mentors appear when you engage steadily over time, not when you chase quick bonds.\n\nIf excitement only shows up in unhealthy ways right now, experiment with healthier sources. Try physical challenges, creative outlets, volunteering, or time in nature. These activities can awaken the same energy in sustainable forms.\n\nHelpful starting points include books such as Atomic Habits by James Clear for building reliable routines, or Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl for understanding purpose in difficult seasons. Free courses on platforms like Coursera or Khan Academy let you explore skills without pressure. Mindfulness apps can train your mind to stay present amid the noise.\n\nProgress will feel slow at first, and that is normal. Be patient as you rebuild the habit of directing your own life. By stepping away from endless feeds and toward deliberate choices, you create space for genuine meaning to emerge. Many have walked this path before you and found their way forward. You can too. The life you actually want is still within reach, waiting for you to start choosing it.",

          "body": "This describes something I have felt for a long time but never really had words for.\n\nFor me the “lost” feeling did not come from a lack of information. If anything I had too much of it. I knew what I should be doing, saving money, building skills, working on something meaningful. The problem was I never turned any of that into real action.\n\nWhat helped was not a big mindset shift but doing small things in the real world and sticking with them longer than the initial excitement. Building something tiny. Testing an idea. Even failing at it. That process gave me more clarity than months of thinking or consuming content ever did.\n\nAt some point I realised purpose does not show up first and then action follows. It is usually the other way around. You act first and meaning slowly forms around it.\n\nOne small thing that helped me move from vague ambition to actual doing was looking at real problems instead of abstract goals. I came across **StartupIdeasDB** while browsing ideas and what stood out was how specific and grounded the problems were. It made starting feel less overwhelming.\n\nYour point about algorithms shaping desire is very real. When everything is constantly pushed at you, it is hard to know what you actually care about. Doing something on your own, even if it is boring or imperfect, gives that sense of ownership back.\n\nThanks for writing this. Posts like this are rare and needed.",

When every option stays open, nothing gets chosen deeply enough to feel meaningful. Purpose usually shows up *after* sustained effort, not before it. Less consumption, more friction, fewer options, longer timelines. That’s where direction starts to form.",

          "body": "I think a big part of why so many people in their late teens and early twenties feel lost has less to do with “laziness” and more to do with how direction gets formed now.\n\nFor a long time, people have discovered meaning by doing things first, trying, failing, getting curious, and only then seeking information. Today it’s reversed. Interests, goals, and even identities are presented to us constantly before we’ve had the chance to experience them ourselves.\n\nWhen everything competes for attention, nothing feels worth committing to. Quick dopamine becomes the only thing that reliably “works,” while long-term goals feel vague and distant.\n\nReclaiming purpose often begins with small steps: creating a quiet space, choosing one thing you care about, and acting on it consistently without waiting to feel fully motivated. Direction doesn’t usually appear first. It emerges *after* you start moving.\n\nIt feels like a lot of people aren’t broken; they’re just living in an environment that makes it hard for them to hear their own voice.",

I figured it'd be easier than hunting thrift stores every weekend. Half the sellers dont even have accurate inventory counts. I placed an order for 50 phone cases last month and the guy messages me 3 days later saying he only has 38 left. Then I had to wait another week for a partial refund because apparently thats just how it works. Second issue is quality control is basically nonexistent when buying in bulk. I ordered what was supposed to be brand new chargers and when I got them half had scratches and looked like returns.  Theres no way to see all the variants side by side or check all the product photos in one view so Im literally opening like 15 tabs trying to figure out which supplier has the best deal. Sometimes items are already sold out by the time I decide and I cant even buy directly through any kind of bulk ordering system, its just regular checkout which is annoying when youre trying to move fast. Would love to hear if anyone cracked this.",

      "selftext": "Three months ago, I was talking to a client who runs a small food marketplace in Australia. She told me about one of her vendors - a single mom who started a home-based dumpling business during COVID. She was doing 50 orders a week, but after UberEats took their cut, she was netting less than minimum wage.\nThe worst part? She had no direct relationship with her own customers. Couldn't email them, couldn't offer loyalty discounts, nothing.\nMy team had just finished building a custom platform for another client, and we thought - what if we created a commission-free model specifically for home cooks?\n\nThe technical challenge was massive:\n・Home cooks are NOT tech-savvy. Whatever we built had to be simpler than Instagram.\n・Payment processing had to handle individual vendors under one platform.\n・We needed a way for customers to discover multiple vendors in their area.\n・Android app was non-negotiable (most vendors only had phones, not computers).\n\nWhat we ended up building:\n・A 2-tap order system for customers\n・Vendor dashboard that literally any grandma could use\n・Automated payout system every 24 hours\n・Zero commission on pickup/self-delivered orders\n\nThe result that still gets me: That same dumpling vendor is now doing 80 orders/week, keeping 100% of her profits, and has a direct SMS list of 200+ customers. She sent us a video of her new kitchen setup last week.\nWe learned that custom software isn't about fancy features - it's about removing the middleman that's eating someone's livelihood.\nThe platform now has 200+ vendors and processes 500+ orders weekly. Not huge numbers, but every one of those orders represents more money in a small business owner's pocket.\n\nWhy I'm sharing this: We have capacity for one similar marketplace project this quarter. If you're in an industry where middlemen are eating your margins (or your vendors' margins), I'd be happy to share our architecture and vendor acquisition playbook.\n\nThe tech stack is React/Node/AWS if you're curious, but honestly, the tech is the easy part. The hard part is designing for non-technical users who just want to sell their food without becoming software experts.",

To see if there’s any way to improve. To get feedback whether it will be received well with my market.\n- I post and put myself out there without self-judgement. I’ve been consistent posting 1-2x daily and only taking days off for “creative expansion” days where I recalibrate and make room for even better ideas\n- I evaluate every single piece of content / sales page / offer I make by sharing my performance stats with ChatGPT. It shows me whats effective and where people are falling off. I take this info and reiterate and repost without worrying if people notice.”\n- I am constantly feeding my brain with expert ideas strategies and ways of thinking via low ticket info products. I feed what’s relevant to me into ChatGPT to help me expand on my current ideas and way of writing and working.\n\nSo far I’ve grown my Facebook platform from 0 to 8000 daily views and engagement has increased similarly too.\n\nI’ve got two different offers in the works - low ticket books and courses for my mom audience where I help them mitigate meltdowns\n\nAnd a mid-ticket group consulting offer for high level biz owners / marketers who want to reach more of their followers on Facebook like I have.\n\nI suppose I’m a mix of excited / curious :)\n\nAnd I keep myself in check asking myself “am I striving?

      "selftext": "I'm 25f, recently opened a marketing agency with my husband and we're expecting to make a good amount of money very soon which is great. I know the title sounds a little dramatic but I could genuinely use some advice especially if you're a bit older and a business owner. I married my husband a year and a half ago, left my country and moved to his, literally into his childhood bedroom. We're together 24/7, working 24/7. No weekends off. I haven't seen my family/friend for like 6 months and they don't even know what we're doing because we don't like to talk about it before we're successful. Actually, I didn't even talk to my dad in around 6 months but thats a different story. As you can probably imagine at this point, our social life is basically dead. \nTime really flies so I don't even really get the time to think about all the things I don't have time for, all I get is exactly 2,5 hours of break at night and that's barely enough to watch some show just to get my mind to stop thinking about work. \n\nWhen my family calls me at random times I almost get annoyed at them for thinking I have time to talk when all I can think of is how to get stuff done. I'm not sure if anyone can relate but my family history is quite diffcult. Addiction and depression, money issues and all of that stuff so running away from that to actually build something that could potentially solve my families problems is what gives everything I do a meaning. Is this something anyone else experiences? And if so, how the f do you deal with it? I don't really wanna make time for anything else but at the same time I feel like people are starting to build resentment because I make them feel like I don't care when it's the opposite. \n\n\nEdit: A lot if you are basically saying \"just talk to them\" which yeah ofc makes sense lol it's family. But I guess not everyone comes from my background so I'll elaborate. I got two bipolar brothers that are both thousands in depth and a bipolar alcoholic unemployed dad with a god complex that was absent for 15 years of my life and lives in a \"third world\" country with another family which means I have another brother thats 14 years old that I feel responsible for. My mom is probably the most normal but even she used to be gone travelling around the world with strange men when I was 14. So talking to my family isn't just a quick nice chat it's usually stressful. It's not even that we argue, but there's always a problem. Money, mental health or someone's about to become homeless LOL. It's not that easy to focus on work and be in contact with them without getting dragged into some Bs. I hope that helps to understand my situation. ",

Replace this with walks or healthy meal prep or reading a book. \n\n2. As soon as you can, hire staff to help reduce the burden. Even before you start making “a good amount of money”. \n\n3. You and your partner should both go out one night a week. Together or even better apart. You don’t have to spend much. But that bedroom will do you in. \n\n4. Remember that your doing today what other people won’t so that you can have tomorrow what other people can’t. I sacrificed much of my 20s into\nmy businesses, but today I have it better than most. \nThere is no balance in the beginning. Don’t listen to the part time “life coaches” that tell you there should be. But try to squeeze in a little bit of personal time. This is where your aha moments come from. Kind of like finding your keys when you stop looking so hard for them. \n\n5. Eat as healthy as you can. Bad food leads to low energy and less than ideal states of mind. \n\n6. Your why is VERY powerful. Print it out and put it up on your wall along with anything else you want. Your partner could do the same. Smile every time you look at it and imbue it with emotion. \n\n7. Talk to your family during your 2.5hrs. You can combine this with walking or meal prepping. When they ask what you’re doing, just let them know you’ll tell them when the time is right.\n\nAnd in the words of Tim Ferris: “Find joy and delight in everything you do”\n\nYou’ve got this!!",

Ofc they can’t do that so much, that you can’t focus on it. But yes you do need to talk to them, when they need it and maybe even you too. For some people that have a shitty family situation, it’s easier to just cut it and become obsessed with work and success. Eventually they’ll either come around or not. They’ll eventually understand, maybe. But you do need to understand it’s your life, so do you. If they try to stop you by time draining then that’s another story then they aren’t your family they are an enemy. But if they care about you, they want to spend time with you and support you. Also it will help make your journey a tiny better. It’s just money and work. For some it’s a way out, for others it’s a way of supporting or other situations, we all have our motivations for why. But you could end up building bad feelings as a byproduct if they feel like they are a burden to your work. But again it depends on the situation, from an visionary perspective. Do you, but don’t ruin your family if they care and love you. That’s stupid. But also practically some people actually don’t need that much time if we boil it down. But you do need to enjoy each other’s company when together and make quality time. And remember money have ruined a lot of families. Don’t say it will, but be careful.

I called it a fuel mule when I was developing it (originally just for my own use fueling my boat up at my dock so I didn't have to overpay at the marina), it was innovative and is now patented, and solves a problem in a new and unique way that really benefits people that have the right use case-- hence 'Smart'.  I've always been a bit of a smart aleck...   And well...  Smart Ass Fuel Mule it is!\n\nThis was our second full year of selling the product, and sales are up about 60% over year one.  That's a step in the right direction, but we've got plenty of room to grow.  I expect 2026 to do really well, especially with how much we're hearing from, and selling to, people starting fuel delivery businesses.  Turns out a motorized fuel caddy is inspiring a lot of new fuel delivery startups, and helping one larger franchise company to expand their offerings.\n\nWe're working hard to reach new markets in addition to the marine market which is our bread and butter (and what this was originally designed around).  We're now reaching the general aviation market better, and even beginning to get some government interest/sales which is exciting.\n\nThis year we continue to press forward into these and other verticals, and we're expanding our product offerings too.  People keep asking for bigger capacity, we've responded and now have a 70gallon unit, and we're working on a 110gal unit with full off-road capabilities.  It's gonna be a good year.",

We borrowed money from our siblings and had 150 custom energy drinks with 3 flavors.\n\nIt didn't do too good so we added add on items like collectibles, plushies, kids toys that related to the gamer niche and it sold really good from average $150 from the energy drinks to making 4-5k a month just from collectibles and toys. The last 3 months, we sold 0 energy drinks but all the kids collectibles kept being sold out. Our brand name has the word energy in it and we don't know if we should rebrand OR keep the site and just keep selling collectibles, plushies and kids toys. Should we throw our main brand energy drinks and tailor to collectibles and the kids market instead? We have passion in our energy drinks and we are worried that it might kill our future passion as we wanted to keep being in the gamer and fitness niche. This is our first business together and we are stuck on what to do. ",

Not at Lan parties, not at eSports events, not on your clan or guild website and especially not with your face on it because you are a famous streamer. Unless you have big boobs maybe. But even then it will not justify the effort. Best outcome will be you have free drinks on your next clan lan party and everyone gives 20 bucks to get rid of your inventory. Concentrate on your collectibles. Cheap worthless crap people don't need always sells well and has huge margins. Especially if you have famous promoters.

You don't have product-market fit for the energy drinks. Something is off in who you're selling it to, what you're selling, how you're selling it, or why your target audience would want to buy it. This business needs it's foundations looked at, starting with the ideal customer you want to serve, what is their name, what do they care about, and why they make energy-drink buying decisons.\n\n\n\nBusiness Two is a plushie/collectible biz, which so far, you HAVE got the hang of. You know who you're selling to. They clearly want the product (plushie-collectibles). They know why they're buying it, at least subconsciously, and you can clearly see the demand. This business could be scaled up if you want to earn some solid income, or it can be closed/sold if it's not a business you're interested in being in.\n\n\n\nIf the businesses are meant to work as one, ie: two-sides-of-one-business, similar to red bull's sports-media branch + red bull's energy drink branch, then you'll either need to find a way to make both profitable, or accept one will always be a loss-leader, not meant to generte income, but instead to found a culture/movement. This is ambitious though, and usually something that is done AFTEr you have a successful product, as the culture will build around it. Technically still doable, but like I said, ambitious if you don't already understand biz basics.\n\n\n\nThe \"name\" issue is irrelevant until you understand the businesses, and who the businesses will be serving, because whatever name you choose must resonate with, and appeal to, the target market (as opposed to turning them off.)\n\n\n\nUltimately the seemingly money-obsessed (or at least money-focused) people in the comments likely aren't worth listening to.\n\n\n\nYou don't have to make important life decisions such as what you're gonna do as your career for the next little while based off of \"money.\"\n\n\n\nThe truth is that consumers will flow dollars to you for *all sorts of things,* when marketed and sold to in ways that resonate with them. This means you can absolutely succeed with energy drinks, or you can succeed with plushies. The only difference is, you stumbled on product-market-fit with one of those already, but not the other.\n\n\n\nThis means plushies will feel \"easier\" for now, since you've got past one of the hardest parts of business, but it doesn't mean you can't do similar with energy drinks.\n\n\n\nIn any case, understanding business deeply, and approaching the situation with calm, maturity, and inner-peace while looking objectively at the facts of the matter, will empower you to make a decision that will serve all involved to the highest level possible.",

Handles everything (payroll, time, taxes) and has clean integrations with QuickBooks/Xero. Decent UI and solid support.\n\nRippling (US) - A step up if you want serious automation. Accurate time tracking, native integrations. Bit pricier but scales well.\n\nFactorial/Sesame HR (Europe) - If you need the full HR package beyond time tracking. Well-made but can be overkill for just payroll + time.\n\nSomething I've noticed almost nobody solves well is the connection between hours worked → projects → actual profitability. Most tools give you the data but you have to manually crunch numbers to know if a project is actually making money or bleeding it. There are some newer options (like [Regist.es](http://Regist.es) in the European market) specifically focused on that: seeing real-time margin per project while the team clocks in/out. For teams with field workers or multiple simultaneous projects, that visibility changes management quite a bit. (Still in development but they let me check out a demo - the approach is interesting.)\n\nMy advice: If you just need basic payroll + hour tracking, QuickBooks Payroll integrated might be enough. If you need profitability visibility per project on top of time tracking, look for something that connects those dots automatically.\n\nAre your workers office-based or in the field? Do you manage multiple projects at once or is it more continuous operations?",

Money allocated to buying your product will often end up in managers' and local officials' pockets, especially when you offer to install a full working version first that they can use to \"prove\" to corruption investigators that it was paid for.  \n\nIf third-party escrow services aren't an option, with a software system you can install a temporary license file for site acceptance, and once they make final payment install the permanent license. Don't tell them about it, though, and if the temporary license file expires (say, after six months) have your system throw up \"data misconfigured, unable to start\" type error messages, and to call customer support. \n\nThat's what we did with a fairly corrupt government agency, and when they called for help to get it running (despite not making the final payment) we said we'd start support once we received payment. They ghosted us (the money was long gone), and some years later when they were audited in an anti-corruption drive, the investigators asked us why that expensive system was apparently never used. I had to testify (via zoom fortunately) and the main bosses went to jail. We did get the initial 30% down payment so it wasn't a total loss for us, though.",

          "body": "Don't know if it's relevant to your situation (or for the future), but in our contracts for things like code deliverables we always include language that says allows the customer to sign off BUT that the project is complete and payable if the customer does not raise any substantive (defect) issue within 30 days of delivery, and therefore due in full. \n\nIn contracts, we include language that says that we'll rectify errors beyond this time for some period--mainly to get over the possible customer objection to signing off and paying. It puts the burden of performance in our court, since we've already been paid, and I trust us more than I trust some customers. \n\nThe dependency on them signing an \"acceptance certificate\" is a real problem, and I'd never go into an engagement in which the client can just not sign a paper and leave things in limbo. But that alone isn't enough if the client is operating in bad faith and has more power than you do. \n\nProgress payments, of course, cut down your financial risk and allow the customer to prove that they are operating in good faith. Optimally we ask for 20-40% on signing, another chunk at V1 milestone, and some portion 20-35% on completion, for a small-medium sized project. More milestones for bigger and/or longer engagements. \n\nIt happens in the US. We once had a large legal information company that might rhyme with, uh, plexus, leave us holding the bag for $180K. Bad on me for letting it get to that point, but I kinda thought that they were good for it. It didn't kill us but it put a dent in the profitability for that year.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this. In a previous time, when we hit the wall during the dot-com meltdown, I talked with my creditors--large and small, including individuals. I explained where we were adn that if they would offer some forebearance I would do my best to pay them as we recovered. It took about 18 months but I repaid everyone little by little and with interest. Have you tried to talk to your creditors? If their reality is that if you go out of business (or they force you out of business), what they recover will be little or nothing, working with you is actually their best option. And talking with them may give you some peace of mind, rather than stiffing everyone and trying to duck creditors.",

It’s one of their textbook “best practices.” They’ve stolen power plant designs, fighter jet designs, etc. You were never going to win, justice doesn’t exist with contract law in China. Who you are and who you know decides the outcome of the cases. They were never going to pick a foreign company over their own.\n\nThat’s why everything there is based on deep personal relationships: “Our families have been doing business for three generations. Your son has married into my brother’s family, so I know you won’t screw me over.” If you don’t have that level of relationship, you’ll get screwed over.\n\nChinese people don’t even trust other Chinese people because contract law isn't really effective-that’s why relationships are everything there.",

The rest is answering emails, managing social media, tracking expenses, dealing with shipping issues, and trying to convince people my pieces are worth the prices I'm charging.\nLast week, someone asked why my necklace cost sixty dollars when they saw \"\"similar ones\"\" for ten dollars elsewhere. I tried explaining handmade quality versus mass production, but they just walked away. It's discouraging to have your work undervalued constantly.\nI've been sourcing some materials from Alibaba to keep costs manageable, which helps with margins, but I worry about maintaining quality while staying competitive on price. Finding that balance is exhausting.\nI'm starting to understand why so many small businesses fail in the first year. The romantic idea of being your own boss crashes hard against the reality of uncertain income and constant problem-solving. Some days I miss my old job security. Other days, I'm proud of every sale I make.\n\n",

Your target market isn’t customers buying $10 garbage. It’s customers interested in a higher quality product and willing to pay more for it. The key is you have to actually make it higher quality. \n\nThe question is also whether there is a market for what you’re selling.

There is a medicine that can help. Do it as a side hustle first! Test, test, and test it some more. Prove it works, and prove you can do it. Then slowly change over to it. \n\nI've seen this a lot with family and friends. Smart, capable people save a bunch of money and quit their job to run their own business. They buy all the things and fill out and sign all the contracts and think that's the hardest part, that's the easiest part! Managing a business while it struggles will take you to the brink, and nobody is prepared for it. \n\nI have a friend who started her own consulting business. Her logo is perfect, she pays every bill early, she spent weeks reading about local and federal taxes to make sure she paid everything correctly, all while her product floundered and she lost money. She was doing the easy stuff to feel productive. The stuff that had a manual. At great cost and a steep learning curve she is starting to make money, but she still struggles a lot and in 5 years has made much less than her day job she quit.\n\nI have a family member who bought a local serciving business. I remember him calling me in tears. \"It's so hard, I have to do everything! I take calls, I set the appointments, I have to do the bookkeeping, I just want to do the work.\" He then blamed me for not volunteering to help enough, so I stopped answering my phone. He eventually sold the bisiness for less than half of what he paid and got his old job back. BTW I told him not to buy it in the first place but he was convinced it would save him and make him happy, it did the opposite.\n\nLastly, I have a super successful friend. Very talented and makes good money being an engineer. Every few years he and his wife get ideas of buying a business. Generally they come to me with an existing business costing $200k to $500k. It has been a restaurant, a cafe, a gym, and recently a sandwich shop. Each time I tell them the same thing, are you prepared to fail and lose all of the money and a year or 2 of your life? And have a miserable time during that time. I also tell them to test and find a business they can start with little to no investment of money. They then decide against it. \n\nThis is probably going to hurt, but almost everyone I know that \"made it\" with their business started in their teens and 20s. You have less to lose and you're more resilient when you're younger. People in their 30s/40s and older have so much more to lose and much less resilience. Think long and hard before quitting your job. Test the business first, and try to start with no or very little startup capital. Having capital upfront will not make you more successful or learn faster, from what I  have seen it does the opposite.",

Some people are gonna be able to participate in (afford) your brand and others wont- thats life and life isnt fair.

I have a great repeat customer that understands what we do and he is almost at a six figure spend with me in under a year. On this giant rock of ours there is bound to be people who \"get it.\" If brands can sell $600+ t shirts, your jewelry made of actually valuable materials is more than justifiable- you just havent found your people yet.

If you have to convince someone of the value of your product then they’re not a customer you want.\n\nIf retail doesn’t seem like a fit for you personally, I would try jumping into wholesaling. It’s much easier to deal with 10 people than 100. Ideally, you’d have both but it’s always a work in progress. \n\nIf you want to spend your time making jewelry, you need to learn to outsource and hire people. Outsourcing does not have to be super expensive if you’re smart about how you do it. \n\nFor example, hiring a cheap freelancer for social media could be beneficial. Let them create the basic posts that clog up your time so you can focus on more sophisticated marketing or something else entirely. \n\nUse software like quickbooks (or whatever works for your industry) that have preset systems and adapt to them. Let tech do the work for you. \n\nThe more you can push off your plate, the more time you can spend selling and making jewelry.",

Payment upfront: they've lost the privilige of credit with you. \n\nBased on their response, it sounds like their business is on its way down. It feels like they'll shut down tbh if they can't manage their finances well enough to avoid this. I bet you're not the only business they're stiffing right now.\n\nTalk to whoever is in charge and be kind, but firm. You're considering legal action but you don't want to torpedo this relationship. You know that they are having difficulties paying, but it's screwing you over after you've already provided services/products to them. Try to negotiate some solution: maybe they pay the biggest invoices first, maybe they pay the oldest first, maybe it's a simple payment plan where they pay $1000 a month. At the very least, if they shut down in 6 months, you'll have received *some* money back.\n\nDuring the Great Recession, the company I worked for really struggled to pay bills. I wasn't there, but my dad is the owner and there were many months where he did not get a paycheck so all the employees and utilities could get paid. The company had to negotiate many payment plans to not lose their vendor relationships. They felt awful not being able to pay, but they knew that not paying anything was screwing over the other businesses - after all, some of their own woes were from people not paying *them!* Some of the payment plans were really longterm (with the vendors with the best relationships we could lean on. some of the payment plan documents I saw lasted years.), some of them were much stricter and shorter. The company made everyone whole, but those companies who were willing to negotiate solutions were very appreciated versus those who went immediately to legal action with no other communication.",

A collections agency can sometimes recover debts faster without involving court, but they typically take a percentage of what they recover. A lawyer might be more expensive upfront but can pursue legal action if the client refuses to pay.\n\nYou could start with a collections agency to attempt recovery, and if that fails, escalate to legal action. Also, make sure all your invoices, agreements, and communication are documented clearly before taking any steps.",

If you go the collection agency you'll pay a substantial amount of whatever they recover, if they recover anything, and that's it.  If you go the lawyer route you'll pay a fortune for their services and if they recover anything they'll take a cut of that also.  Small claims court islike $50-100 to file a claim. It'll involve a few mornings or afternoons of your time for an hour or so each time, but if you were hired for work or they ordered goods and did not pay, they are dead In the water and have no argument against you.  The court will issue a judgment against them, which is the ugly stain on a credit report, and then you can file for either a lien application to their personal property, or you can file for a wage garnishment if they work.  Either way, there's a roadmap to getting money out of them hopefully, and quite often a court officer will convince them to pay up to avoid the credit woes or to negotiate a settlement.  Half is better than zero if they're willing to make a deal.",

      "selftext": "Five years ago, my cousin and I started a small blue‑collar business that has recently become pretty successful. From the beginning, we agreed to pay ourselves a modest monthly amount and reinvest most of the profits back into the business. I trusted him to handle the financial side because he had experience and I didn’t.\n\nI’ve now discovered he’s been using the business account for personal expenses—family vacations, a vehicle for his wife, private school tuition for his kids, and more. He also took out a $40k loan under the business without telling me, and I still don’t know what the money was used for. The business account is drained, and we’re now in debt under both of our names. He is not sorry for what he's done.\n\nTo make things worse, we never signed any formal partnership agreement, but we did create an LLC. I was inexperienced and didn’t realize how risky that was.\n\nI want to leave and start my own business, but I’ve spent five years helping build the reputation, customer base, and goodwill of this one. I’d like him to keep the current business, but I feel like I should be compensated for the value I helped create.\n\nHow can I determine what a fair buyout amount would be? Has anyone been in a similar situation?",

          "body": "This is practical advice only based on my experience. \n\nI've been party to an unfriendly two-person LLC breakup, with me and a silent partner. As the operating member I made financial decisions, including for my own compensation, with which my silent partner later took issue. He sued and I lawyered up, just like you will do.\n\nHis suit focused on my comp. My goal all along had been to buy him out of the company, but he was completely non-responsive to any communication. So having him sue me was a good thing in that sense--it started the process. That's a strategy--your partner will have to pay attention.\n\nBut--as soon as he sued, I had legal representation from a top-5 law firm. I think receiving my response to his suit from a very serious firm settled him down a bit and let him know that we would not be bullied or put off. That was key, in my opinion. \n\nOur response proposed that we submit the matter to mediation. But we required him to drop the suit, reasoning that we could talk or we could fight but not both. We mediated and came to a price that was about what I had thought to offer him before he sued. I even got him to finance it.\n\nI'm sharing this because I believe it would be wise to figure out what you want to have happen, but also how you would like it to happen. Think down the road past the dispute and keep it about numbers, whether you want to retain the business or walk away. There may be other considerations. For example, I'd suggest talking to your bank about an SBA loan to potentially finance the company on the other side of the transaction. Your partner may not have a lot of cash if he's taking from the company. If you take him out of the existing company and finance it over time (not optimal, given distrust), you may need some cash for operations. Or, on the other hand, he may need financing to buy you out (though that might be tough if the books are a mess). \n\nAbout mediation--I think my legal costs were about $25K (though I got a bit of deal through connections), much less than they would have been had we pursued the matter via lawsuit, and really just noise in terms of the total buyout cost.  \n\nGood luck.",

      "selftext": "TLDR: Vietnamese parents, born in NY, live in Tokyo, wasted my fathers final investment into me, but 2 years ago turned it around by thinking radical first principles and building a streetwear brand that's on track to hitting $3M+ next year.  \n\n5 years ago, my father told me \"this is the last I'll ever invest into you\", when he gave me $5,000 to invest into inventory for my previous failed brand. This year, we hit $1M in revenue. The harsh truth is, the $5k investment my father gave me went to $0 because I failed to get traction with the 3rd Fashion Brand idea I had come up with. \n\nI'm Vietnamese, born in NY, now live in Tokyo. The pain and guilt of spending my fathers hard earned money on a failing business was something that has taken me years to shake off and still to this day, despite my earnings I still feel a strong level of imposter syndrome. I plan to repay my father very soon for all that he has given to me, but for some reason the sweetness of the triumph just isn't what I anticipated, it's more of a relief rather than excitement. \n\nWith all that being said, I feel like I have learnt a lot of lessons building 4 Fashion Brand, 3 of which failed miserably and the 4th is now on track to hitting $2 - $3M next year. \n\n1. Psychographics. Psychographics. Psychographics.\n\nYou know how everyone talks about ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) and your Target Customer. All of those concepts IMO fail to capture what the essence of market research. Credit where credit is due, this is a concept I learnt from Seena Rez who's a fashion YouTuber, as well as Seth Godin's Purple Cow. Psychographics is the study of people according to their attitudes and aspirations. It's learning everything about who these people are, more than just their age, gender, education level...It's about understanding their social media algorithms, the brands they love to buy from, the deep rooted identity based insecurities and desires they have. This is the single most important concept that I learnt that enabled me to be able to actually create a brand that resonated with a specific niche of people. I heard a quote from Seena Rez on David Ogilvy, the famous advertiser in the 1950's who said \"your customer is your wife\" and it means to truly understand your customer far beyond what you imagined to understand, like how you'd understand your wife. \n\n2. Early Adopters\n\nIn fashion it's all about spotting trends, trickle down theory but this concept applies to a ton of verticals. You've got Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority and Laggards. When it comes to finding opportunity, we find it through Early Adopters, a specific characteristic of people who validate a product/concept right in that goldilocks zone where it's got enough validation without being too adopted (saturated). This is part of the Diffusions of Innovations Theory and I saw this graph in the Purple Cow by Seth Godin but it was the video by Seena Rez on YouTube where he built a fashion brand using this exact same concept, where it revitalised that lesson and actually resulted in me implementing it this time. \n\nRegardless of what market you are in, ask yourself, do you know 20 Early Adopters in the market? Do you know where they congregate and hang out? Knowing who they are go's hand in hand with the concept of Psychographics, it's what allows us to be able to find opportunity and resonate\n\n3. First Principles reasoning\n\nI've seen a lot of Business Guru's talk about this concept. Alex Hormozi mentions how he studies Elon Musks thinking style, similarly the Fashion YouTuber Seena Rez talks about Marc Andreeson. But it wasn't until 2 years ago where I actually grasped what it meant to think through First Principles and the best way I understood it was comparing it to reasoning by analogy. \n\nI would find brands that were doing well, and copy what they were doing without a fundamental understanding as to why they were actually doing well. Which resulted in me creating these frankenstein copy cat dropshipping brands that lacked any soul or resonance with my market. Once I started \"questioning the requirements\", I began to actually figure out what people wanted and then worked up from there. This allowed me to look outside of the fashion world and understand the Streetwear culture's entire ethos, which gave way to a lot of innovation within my brand. \n\nIt was through reasoning with First Principles, that I was able to get in touch with a Vietnamese manufacturing hub to solve one of the biggest issues Street Wear brands have when it comes to sourcing. Leveraging my heritage (being Vietnamese), I noticed that most of these brands struggled to figure out supply chain with a specific style of SKU, and that's been really killer for us as well. \n\nAll in all, have to give credit to Seth Godin, Seena Rez especially for allowing all of the lessons that were dormant inside of my mind to click when it comes to fashion specifically and a few other fashion YouTubers as well. Don't be afraid to listen to material from other creators, if you maintain a radically first principles like reasoning method, you won't be prone to copy catting and getting lost in the sauce of their nuance. \n",

That way when a location wants something quick you're not starting from scratch every time. Also don't sleep on just reposting the same content with slight tweaks across locations on different days.

          "body": "Edit: just jumping in to say I absolutely confused cash flow for revenue in the below original comment and  the numbers are off in that regard, but the below analysis should absolutely be considered for anyone buying a business. You will still need to factor in a huge hit of cash flow if financing any deal. That was my biggest shock when I bought my business.\n\n***\n\nOK I'm just going to approach this from a purely numbers perspective. Here's what I did.\n\nI bought a business with advertised revenue of 450k and Owner earnings of 150k. That 150k was split between a husband and wife that would both eventually exit.\n\nReality was the 450k was due to the pandemic, my normalized revenue first year was closer to 370k. I also gave all employees a 10% raise as soon as I took over, which pushed labor cost to be 50% of revenue due to the nature of this service business.\n\nMy projected yearly owner earnings were going to be 80k before purchase, but after purchase and Reality hit in the first 2 years it was closer to 40k per year. This is due to lower than expected revenue and insane interest on the SBA loan I took out. \n\nBefore you purchase, consider this:\n1) 1m for 350k cash flow is a steep price, especially for a franchise. 350k per year is 30k per month. Are you financing the deal? \n\n1m financed with 20% down can expect a payment of around 10.7k per month. So you're down to 19.3k per month.\n\nExpect franchise fees of 10% from top line revenue. So we're down to 16.3k per month.\n\nNow, how much is labor going to cost you? In an ideal perfect scenario, it's 30% of revenue, but expect 40% until you get things figured out. This is no leadership hires. We are down to 6.3k per month. \n\nSo with 6.3k per month are you able to afford all other expenses to run the business AND pay yourself to live, AND pay a GM to run it all?\n\nThe answer is most certainly no. Unless you're buying it with cash, which frees up 10.7k per month, but I have a feeling that's not the case.\n\nHope this helps.",

They are passionate about kava and there is a big culture around it. They like to take shots and yell “Bula” as a cheers.\n\nI’ve been going to kava bars since I was high school.

Before you sign an LOI, you need to run a **'Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)'** analysis with a sensitivity check:\n\n* *If regulations tighten and sales drop 15%, does the business still generate enough cash to pay the loan?*\n\nIf the answer is no, you could personally default on the loan even if the business is technically 'profitable.'\n\nHappy to help you run those loan scenarios if you want to see if the risk/reward actually makes sense.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I run a small family restaurant and honestly, I'm kinda freaking out right now. Last week, out of nowhere, we got slammed with 10 one star reviews on our Google Maps listing. All of them are super vague, like \"terrible service\" or \"food was cold,\" but here's the thing - I've checked our records, and none of these people have ever actually eaten here. I'm pretty sure it's from other restaurants on my street trying to sabotage us because business has been picking up lately. any tip on how to remove quickly those reviews? Google is not answering to our reports and emails.",

This is a very common google maps extortion scam and the agencies know about this. The first step is file a police compliant, file FBI with their online crime division, forgot their name, I3 or something. Then, appeal all these reviews. The appeal will most likely be rejected but you will get an appeal number. Make an excel list of all these fake reviews along with the appeals theyre under and then goto google business community page and look for similar cases. They will like you to post it in a certain way. Hopefully a diamond or a platinum member will pick this up and then they will block your account first and delete these. Its frustrating why Google allows reviews to be posted on US businesses from overseas. I’m saying this from memory, but if you need specific directions let me know and i will have to look at exactly what i did and will direct you to the template",

ICHRA can be a great exit ramp from the small-group hamster wheel, but it’s not magic.\n\nPros:  \n- Cost control – You set a defined budget. No surprise 12–20% renewals driven by things your team didn’t even use.  \n- Decouples risk – One employee’s cancer, NICU baby, or specialty drug doesn’t blow up everyone else’s rates. If community rated today, not relevant, may be worth taking a quick glance at something like UHC AllSavers or Aetna AFA for a medically underwritten proposal instead of community rated  \n- Employee choice – People can pick plans that actually fit them (single vs family, HDHP vs richer plans, different networks/carriers).  \n- Portability – Coverage isn’t tied to staying at your company forever, which employees increasingly value.  \n- Scales – Works the same at 12 lives as it does at 120.  \n\nCons:  \n- Execution matters – ICHRA done “DIY” often fails, EE self-service is a struggle  \n- Employees need real help shopping and understanding tradeoffs.  \n- Change management – Some employees like group plans simply because they’re familiar, no national PPO access with most ICHRA markets  \n- Essential Health Benefits vary by state (mainly relevant if in multiple states)  \n- Market variability – Individual market quality varies by state and carrier density.  \n- Perception risk – If framed poorly, employees think “company is dumping insurance,” even when the math is better for them and the company.  \n\nICHRA isn’t a plan replacement as much as a funding strategy.\n\nThe experience your employees have depends almost entirely on:  \n- how much guidance they get,  \n- how transparent you are on dollars,  \n- and whether you treat it as a benefit redesign vs a cost cut.\n\nIf works well for:  \n- Employers who want predictability more than carrier logos  \n- Owners willing to over-communicate during the transition\nUsing a platform + advisor combo instead of “here’s a link, good luck”  \n\nIf your group plan keeps getting worse and more expensive, you’re not crazy, that’s the system behaving exactly as designed. ICHRA just lets you opt out of that design.\n\nHappy to answer more specific questions if helpful.\n\nThink of it as the 401k of healthcare, that's how I like to explain it anyways. It's not a pension (group health plan), it's very similar to the democratization that 401ks provided.\n\nYou'd certainly be an early adopter still at this stage, but it's the fastest growing segment of the \"group insurance\" market today.",

I also know there is cost pressure to keep prices the same or lower.\n\nLarge corporate customers will continue to ask for discounts or longer payment terms: Net 45 to 60, Net 60 to 75, or 90 days, etc. \n\nI would rather keep prices at 2025 levels and extend payment terms within reason than accept a price reduction.\n\nFor Q3-Q4 '25, I had a large corporate client negotiate a 20% holdback, payable at the end of the year plus 30 days. This definitely helped their cash flow, and hurt my Q4.\n\nHow is your business handling any pricing adjustments for 2026? Have you thought of pricing strategies or payment term strategies to appease your existing, large clients?\n",
