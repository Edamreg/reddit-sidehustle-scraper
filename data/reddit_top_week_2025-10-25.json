      "selftext": "For years I tried everything... Im talking so many different things.. dropshipping, website design, URL website arbitrage,  affiliate programs, freelancing, print-on-demand....you name it. Every time I thought I‚Äôd found ‚Äúthe one,‚Äù I would lose steam out after a few weeks. Sometimes it was because it wasnt for me, other times it was because life got in the way.\n\nNow I‚Äôm 40, and about a year ago (my wife told me about it 4 years ago ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)  I stumbled into something that finally¬†*worked*: UGC, which stands for user-generated content.\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt heard of it, it‚Äôs when regular people (not influencers.. Im just a random normal dude) create videos that brands use for their paid ads or organic social media. No following required, no crazy tech setup, just the ability to film, talk naturally, and understand/follow requests from a brand.\n\nFor me, this clicked because it rewards experience, not youth. The industry is full of younger creators, but many brands actually want creators who look like their real customers. Parents, homeowners, professionals, real people with life experience.\n\nIt took me 5 years of failed side hustles to find something that let me use my personality, storytelling, and creativity and actually get paid for it. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúeasy,‚Äù but it‚Äôs accessible, and it‚Äôs been life changing.\n\nIf you‚Äôre 35+ and still trying to find something that sticks, UGC is worth looking into.. it changed my life and as I was sitting here eating lunch I figured I would share because maybe it could change someone else's too.",

Package it as a niche retainer: 4 videos per month per brand with 30-day usage included, upsell a paid usage extension and whitelisting after month one, and ask for a 3-month minimum so two retainers cover the base. Are most of your deals one-offs right now, or could you shift two brands into retainers next quarter?",

      "selftext": "A few days, I shared a post titled\\*‚ÄúIt took me 5 years to finally make money online and now I‚Äôm finally full time and thriving.‚Äù\\*\n\nSince then, I‚Äôve had hundreds of people reach out asking¬†how to get started in UGC, so I figured I‚Äôd make a road map post breaking it all down.\n\nLet‚Äôs be clear:¬†it‚Äôs not easy.  \nBut it¬†*is*¬†accessible and that‚Äôs the beauty of it.  \nIt‚Äôs just a matter of putting the pieces together and staying consistent.\n\nThat said,¬†UGC isn‚Äôt for everyone.  \nIf you hate being on camera, don‚Äôt like sending emails, negotiating, or doing admin work then this probably isn‚Äôt for you.\n\nAlso, anyone who says¬†*you have to buy a course*¬†to learn ANYTHING is a liar.  \nYou can 100% learn UGC or anything else in this world on your own using posts like this, YouTube, and trial and error.\n\nThat said,¬†courses and mentorships can shorten your learning curve, you‚Äôll learn faster, make fewer mistakes, and have people to lean on when you hit roadblocks.  \nIt‚Äôs optional, but it¬†does¬†speed things up.\n\n# Quick FAQ\n\n* **What is UGC?**¬†‚ÄúUser Generated Content.‚Äù It‚Äôs content (usually short-form video) made by regular people for brands to use in paid ads or organic social posts.\n   * **Do I need followers?**¬†No. Brands care about the quality and relatability of your videos, not your audience size. If they do care about your audience size then its influencer marketing not UGC\n   * **Do I need to show my face?**¬†Not always. Voiceovers, product demos, and unboxing videos are all fair game but in my opinion if you never plan on showing your face I probably wouldn't recommend UGC\n* **What equipment do I need?**¬†Your phone and a tripod. A lav mic and LED light (each around $20) are great bonuses.\n* **Do I need experience?**¬†No. You‚Äôll learn as you go. Brands care more about energy, clarity, and authenticity.\n* **What age can do it?**¬†All ages and the industry really needs more people**35+**¬†right now.\n* **Do I need to be good-looking?**¬†Nope. The more¬†normal and relatable¬†you are, the better.\n* **Will my friends/family see my videos?**¬†Probably one day. So only create content for products you‚Äôd be comfortable being seen promoting.\n\n# Step-by-Step: How to Get Started\n\n# 1. Understand What UGC Is\n\nSearch¬†**#UGCexample**¬†on X (Twitter) to see real examples.  \nUGC videos are typically ads for Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube where a creator promotes a product in a real, authentic way.\n\n# 2. Build a Simple Portfolio\n\nUse¬†**Canva**¬†(free version).  \nYou don‚Äôt need Canva Pro.  \nCreate a clean, single-page site with your example videos and an¬†*About Me*¬†section.  \nBuy a $20 URL inside Canva so it looks professional.\n\n# 3. Create 4 Example Videos\n\nUse products you already own.  \nFocus on¬†**good lighting**¬†and¬†**clear sound.**  \nPick four different niches to show variety e.g.:\n\n* 1 beauty or skincare\n* 1 pet-related\n* 1 fitness or wellness\n* 1 app or SaaS product\n\nMake each video a¬†*different style:*\n\n* Talking head with b-roll\n* Voiceover + only b-roll\n* Green screen\n* Testimonial/review\n\n# 4. Film an ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù Video\n\nThis goes on your portfolio alongside your written intro and you can also use it on profiles inside UGC specific platform.  \nUse natural light, keep it conversational, and overlay b-roll that represents you.\n\nDon‚Äôt just say ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Roseanne and I create authentic content.‚Äù  \nInstead, make it personal and specific: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Roseanne, a 38-year-old stay-at-home mom from Utah. I love gardening, fitness, and art. After years in the corporate world, I‚Äôm tech-savvy and love testing new apps and tools. My lean on my past experience in XYZ to work with brands, understand their vision and the scope of their needs, and then deliver content that is valuable and meaningful.\n\nBullet points are easier to read and focus on what makes¬†*you*¬†unique: glasses, grey hair, pets, travel, hobbies, etc.\n\n# 5. Start Applying for Gigs\n\nOnce your portfolio and 4 examples are ready, start applying daily.  \nCheck:\n\n* subreddit : ugccreators has a lot of  job listings \n* X (hashtags: #UGCCreatorsNeeded, #UGCOpportunities)\n* UGC platforms:¬†**Billo, JoinBrands, Vidsy, Cohley, Vidovo, Insense, Popfly, Backstage, Upwork**\n\nTreat it like a¬†**numbers game.**  \nIf you apply every day for an hour, you‚Äôll start landing gigs.  \nIf you apply to 2x more, you‚Äôll land 2x more. ( if you apply 1 hour a day and land 1 gig a week, then apply 2 hours a day and youll land 2 gigs a week)  \nOver time, you can add social proof to your portfolio, your examples get better, and reviews snowball into consistent paid work.\n\nI hope this helps and feel free to ask me anything below.  \nI try to respond to every message, even if it takes a bit.",

I can link you my social media accounts in DMs if you're interested in seeing what kind of videos I do currently (and see what you think about the quality).",

If you want something more flexible, you can do online tasks  like freelancing basic stuff on Fiverr or Upwork (data entry, writing short descriptions, etc.) or even managing social media pages for small local businesses.

Do they all drive really expensive cars? Do they have fancy gardens and lawns? Do they all like to play tennis? etc.\n\nNow go home and look up the things you see those rich people doing. And see what jobs there are that help maintain those rich people things. Some of those jobs have a low barrier to entry. Like waxing fiberglass, it takes a $50 tool, some buffing compound, and strong arms that don't get tired easily. But people with money will pay to have their boat waxed every year because then it's shiny.  Or maybe they want to have their cars professionally detailed in their own driveway? Or maybe they want their leather golf club bag given some leather care and cleaning? Or maybe they'd like to have someone come to their house and use a sonic cleaner for their jewelry? Or have all their stupid-expensive knives sharpened up to 3000 grit? Or wash their walkway, driveway, patio, &amp; brick with a pressure washer?  Or have the numbers for their house repainted?\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nFind what people who have money don't want to do themselves, and offer to do that thing. If you don't have a skill, offer to do a thing that doesn't require a lot of skill, but does require a lot of time and maybe gets dirty. Things rich people don't like dealing with.\n\nStart your own business. As you get better at it, you can raise your price. As you get even better at it, the fact that you take less time means you can do more jobs without lowering your price making you more money. Maybe you can even hire a helper or two.\n\nThis is how my ex's brother went from student to independently wealthy in about 5 years. He just took most of the money he made (in his case lawn care) and spent it on expanding his little business. In the end he had multiple trucks, a whole bunch of lawnmowers, about 15 employees, and he sold the business to his best employee and used it to buy a McMansion for cash.",

You could also print out paper fliers and post them around neighborhood shops (with permission). Make sure a trusted adult knows the addresses you‚Äôre visiting to work. \n\nYou could also try offering babysitting, simple tutoring, or pet sitting services in the same way, but these services may be harder to sell with 0 experience. People will want to know why they should trust you with their kids (a you CPR certified? trustworthy? good with kids? etc) or knowledgable about pets, or that you are tutoring a subject you are good at (did you get straight As in AP Language Arts?) etc. Maybe you have a skill you had not considered before tho? \n\nThe other old fashioned way to get a job. I‚Äôd suggest restaurants if you can swing it, they usually pay unskilled youth the best, because you‚Äôll generally get a share of tip money in addition to minimum wage. Sometimes you can take cash home the same day you work. Any job will do, though! See if you can help out in a field you are interested in possible working in someday. \n\nThe new-fashioned way is online. Sell crafts on Ebay or Etsy, make videos for Tiktok &amp; YT. Write an ebook. There are lots of posts about this, look them up.",

      "selftext": "Okay, after nine actual side hustles, I'm pretty sure my biggest accomplishment is proving I can come up with way more terrible ideas than good ones. Seriously.\n\nI‚Äôve tried everything‚Ä¶. Etsy shops, blogs, print-on-demand, random AI projects, Pinterest loops, even indexing experiments that made my laptop sound like it was about to take off. Most of them died quietly. A few survived. And the stuff that stuck honestly had less to do with talent and more to do with timing.\n\nFirst lesson learned: quit the guessing game. My 'cool' ideas always crashed and burned. But when I simply started paying attention to the data, like trending keywords, those sudden search spikes, and what people were actually buying, things finally picked up. It's unsexy, sure, but it gets the job done.\n\nNext up, I realized loops are king. Forget doing one-off projects; it‚Äôs all about creating these little engines. Like Pinterest traffic sending folks to a blog, or old Medium articles funneling people to Etsy, or even just old listings getting evergreen sales thanks to reviews. The best ones were the ones that just kept going without me having to obsess over them.\n\nLesson three, ditch the 'originality' obsession. I seriously thought I needed to conjure up something nobody had ever seen. Nope. Turns out, just taking a winning concept, giving it your own spin, and getting it out there quickly is a far more profitable game.\n\nThe rest? It‚Äôs mostly noise. Fancy tools, new ‚Äúgrowth hacks,‚Äù even ads, they helped sometimes, but not for long. What actually worked was keeping things small, repeating what clicked, and not getting bored when it got repetitive.\n\nOn paper, none of this sounds particularly impressive. But it's effective, and it just works, silently. And after diving into nine different hustles, I can tell you, 'quietly working' is now infinitely more appealing than the fleeting promise of 'maybe going viral.\n\nAnyone else find that the simple, boring stuff ends up working best?",

You can go shopping all day, hit up your favorite stores, bring the kids if needed etc. It's a ton of fun and easy money. It's how I initially got into Amazon FBA, but some of the most lucrative and high earning retail arbitrage sellers are SAHMs. I learned most of the initial tips watching a lady on youtube who was a SAHM, she was my gateway into the entire thing.

It is really simple you can start for $20 dollars buying designer colognes directly from the factory supplier and resell for $200+. I have being doing this for 3 months and i am already up to $1000 a week.\n\nYou just have to find good vendor/suppliers, I got mine from here [shadowresellz.com](http://shadowresellz.com) all great and high quality.",

With your skill set you could also offer freelance and consultant services if your skills are in demand. You can use TikTok and YouTube to advertise your services and if you get enough views you may even get a bit of ad revenue from TikTok and YouTube after a period of time although that would be long-term and slow rather than fast.\n\nDigital products might be a good idea but you need to come up with solutions for problems that no one has addressed yet and position yourself as a subject matter expert as digital products are very saturated.\n\nOf course check what other people are doing on Fiverr and similar websites and copy them while also undercutting them and later raise your prices after getting many sales and reviews.",

Like a brick wall or some such. \n\nFor extra money do some photoshop for either skin issues or transparent glasses. See YouTube on how to do that. \n\nI setup, 15 min, shoot 15 min, Lightroom maybe 30 min. I buy USB thumb drives in bulk from Aliexpress. Put exported Jpgs on it (3 different resolutions, low for Facebook, mid for computer background, 8x10 600dpi), parent can go anywhere for prints. \n\nGather stuff 15 min. I stay longer to ensure customer is happy and won‚Äôt charge more, to a limit. Depends on next customer that day. \n\n100$ - 200$ for such a service would be standard. Plus if kid is ready, all is done in 5 minutes. The other ten minutes (or more), get each parent also, whole family, etc. Bother and sister is very popular. Custom backgrounds are also very popular. \n\nI often just take random pics on vacation (beach), in parks and near landmarks with perfect noon-day sunny day just for this. I‚Äôm thinking of printing 8x10 or A4 format, 6 or 8 backgrounds, put in a catalog, have the parent select while taking pictures. \n\nSchool pics are easily 100$-300$ as you pay per printed kit. A cheap kit is like 100$. \n\nI shoot with Nikon D800 and lens for portrait mode.\n\nYa my setup is top notch but sometimes you can improvise, find used, and lower your portable studio startup costs.",

My brother taught me a bit of python, I felt smart, I thought rent would sort itself out. It didn‚Äôt, it didn‚Äôt at all. I spun up WordPress, let chatgpt and Gemini grind around 500 posts, added meta tags and whatnot, watched the analytics like a hawk, refreshed again, refreshed again also. Ad revenue after half a year was $28.35, which might buy me a lunch.\n\nI tried AI faceless videos too. Stock voices, avatars, tool recs. One clip hit 48 views, most did 30 or less, and I was down \\~280 for subs. A comment said it felt like an ad made by an AI for another AI, which is kinda fair and also also painful.\n\nI even pushed AI stock photos. Hundreds uploaded, ten downloads, $6.3 usd. The only thing that actually gave me money back was price drop monkey, clawed about $148.5 in gift cards from pirce drops. Not income, but defintely real cash back, unlike teh promise of passive anything.\n\nIf someone here cracked it without ads or an audience, I‚Äôm listening.",

That's where the magic happens, this is like nicotine, you will always upload at the same time, giving the followers a routine, in the end it can only \"snowball\". \n\nto summarize :  \n\\- Study your audience before\n\n\\- Find the best niche for your audience\n\n\\- Built first WITHOUT EXPECTING ANY RETURNS\n\n\\- Your punctuality will make your community grow\n\n\\- Make longer videos once you have regular viewers who already like your content\n\nYou will eventually have videos who wont pop off but that's part of the game, your on your own, you try things, you don't need ads, you just need to work your audience.\n\nIn two weeks I gained 1Million views across 28videos + 4K followers and 83K likes, ALL WITHOUT ADS !",

It surprisingly took off: the world leaderboard now has over 3,000 farts logged from 100 countries. At first I just wanted to see if something that absurd could go viral, I now added a personal leaderboard recently so users could compete with themselves. Already six people have signed in with google and i'm so happy to say I have pushed my revenue from $1 to $2.46 (mostly through affiliate clicks). It‚Äôs not life-changing money, but it‚Äôs validation that even the weirdest ideas can earn something if you: Build fast and iterate based on feedback, Find joy in a micro-niche and don‚Äôt overthink ‚Äúscalability‚Äù early on. Cheers. Tuute CEO ",

I‚Äôm willing to work hard. I just can‚Äôt seem to find something that clicks long-term. I‚Äôve thought about freelancing, learning a trade, starting something online, even going back to school‚Ä¶ but every option feels like starting from zero.\n\nIf you‚Äôve been through this or found your direction later in life, how did you figure it out? What helped you break through that ‚Äústuck‚Äù feeling?\n\nWould love to hear real stories or advice from others who‚Äôve been there.\n\nA 40-year-old still trying to figure it out, I feel depressed!",

Do you have any hobby interests that translate, maybe think outside the box?\n\nThese are all skills I developed at seperate points in my life, but really dedicated the initial time to learn, leaving me huge variety now, flexibility, and fun!  $$ amounts are Canadian\n\n- I teach guitar/piano ($80/hour, currently 30 hours a week from home, because I am really enjoying it, but sometimes I slim it to 15-20 hours if my other interests are higher. $60,000-$100,000/yr\n\n- I teach people how to fly model planes and racing drones($50/hour ish), and teach groups of kids how to build and launch rockets. Very casual, i do this in the dry months, probably just a couple times a week. Most parents are lazy, and won‚Äôt help their kids/youth with these specific hobbies, or think they are going to be expensive (they are not ).  So plenty of room for private instruction. \n\n- Book Keeping for small businesses. Not much skill required. It is not mathy and accounting. It is book keeping.  Don‚Äôt need any license or schooling. Just take some free courses online and find a mentor. Flat rate per month.  Probably $60k/year for 10 hours a week of whenever-I-want work at the coffee shop. \n\n- I enjoy working with wood. I have a full garage of wood working tools and machines, all paid for exclusively by making wooden towel ladders, and wood wall hexagons to sell to moms/wives on Facebook.   Towel ladders cost about $10 to make, and about 40 minutes to make 4 or 5 of them. I sell for $40-60 depending on details\n\n- I love flipping and trying music gear on marketplace. I rarely buy anything and then sell it for less.  I recycle the money into more gear. Guitars, PA Systems, FX pedals, etc.\n\n- I make video courses and sell on Udemy.  I have a course on how to solve the basic Rubik‚Äôs cube for a complete beginner.  It took me 4 hours to completely create and upload the course including design and film and edit.    It has made $500 total so far in about 6 months. But that‚Äôs a good hourly rate for the work.  I have other similar courses that do better, but that‚Äôs a good example of just thinking outside the box. \n\nOverall, private instruction is just a great living if you are confident in your skill. There are millions of people who only learn well with face to face human contact, and not online videos.    Teach/Instruct anything. \n\nI do have a degree in music, but it‚Äôs in a box in the basement since I got it and no one has ever asked to see it.  I‚Äôve made more money from hobby endeavours, than when I taught in school/college level. \n\nIt‚Äôs the literal ‚Äòfollow your dreams‚Äô approach. \n\nGood luck, message me anytime.",

          "body": "First of all, it's not too late. At age 40, I felt completely stuck in my career as a bank manager. And while I was grateful to have a good-paying job, the work environment was terrible. I had a borderline abusive boss, high-stress, high pressure, and I felt like I had no option but to stick with it until retirement (at least age 60). I couldn't afford to quit. I had a family to look after (married, 3 kids) and we were a single income family. \n\nThankfully, that wasn't the end of my story. \n\nAt age 42, I hit my breaking point, and decided that I was going to do whatever it takes to create another path. Not just go to a different company, but build a business that aligned with the lifestyle my wife and I dreamed of. For us, that was self-employment - a fully remote business that would give us full control over our time and allow us to work from anywhere. \n\nWith no entrepreneurial background and very few skills in online business, etc. I taught myself how to build a basic website, and I started a personal finance blog. I must have watched a couple hundred hours of YouTUbe tutorials to figure it out. That led to a freelancing side hustle, which became a full-time business and replaced my $120k/year bank manager job. \n\nI walked away from the 9-5 in 2022. \n\nToday, I own 2 profitable businesses, both from my laptop. My wife is at home with me and helps me with parts of both businesses. \n\nTwo of our kids are out of the house now, our youngest (19) is still at home. But we have so much time for our kids, our schedules are such that we can help them with various things when needed. For example, we dog-sat for our son and his wife this week while they were out of town. I just worked from their place. Next month, we're flying to Vancouver to see our daughter off as she leaves for Hawaii for six months. \n\nThen, we'll be heading south later in the winter to escape the cold in Canada. \n\nIf you had asked me if any of this was possible in my early 40s, I would have said you are crazy. But I just started on that path, took control over my future, and it completely changed the trajectory of my life. \n\nIf you have more specific questions, let me know. I'd be happy to share any wisdom I have.",

But it is possible to make it work.  \n  \nI've done many different businesses since I was 15-16, some did quite well, some failed completely, but I think all of those failures made me learn new skills that compounded. But even if I was able to make some of those businesses work and had enough saves up, after covid I still got depressed and pretty much wasted 5 years of my life not doing anything, until life forced me to start doing something.

I must say, I feel you. \nI screwed up high school for various reasons, then started in life with no degrees (in France, that is terrible as this is the main criteria that determines your value on the work scenery, but I had some hope at the time that I will find my way).\nDid several jobs, mostly mechanical maintenance in the steel industry and nuclear power plants, but that was definitely not my cup of tea (I studied biology...). It paid decently though, especially nuclear shit.\nI also lived abroad and travelled a lot, which made me a different thinking person compared to the average people in my place, quite out of the box and definitely not a good rat for the race.\n\nI eventually started doing ecomm, later opened an ecomm company with my wife that did pretty well for several years but things turned bad and we went out of business, with all the problems you can imagine, debts, wrecked psychological and mental health.\nHad to start a job from way below zero at 38, with 2 kids, a low paying one because, you know, it's all about degrees.\nI just turned 40 a few months ago, and comparing my life, my situation with other people my age or even younger is really depressing, since I lost almost everything and still have debts.\nAnd I am on the way to find THE path, my situation may sound desperate to me at nighttime, when I can't sleep, but this life gave me a strong resilience capacity and the power to keep hope.\n\nI know it will be damn hard, will have to start again from scratch, but trust me, this is not as rough as you may think, if you find some pleasure in it or have an attainable financial goal, the path will be enjoyable. The most important, now that I lost all that shit, is to not lose yourself. If you know who you are, what you are capable of and what you love, you can do great things. And it is the most valuable thing I lost, myself...\n\nSo, as it was said earlier, travel, do new things, get out of your comfort zone, try to find yourself before trying to find your path, this will lead you to things you may not be aware of !\nBut never forget you are not alone stuck in this scheme, and no matter where others are at, write your own story buddy, and that requires you to deeply know yourself. \nWish you the best, as I do to everyone who is lost in their own life ‚úåüèº",

Money is a placeholder for, and a way to measure, the relative value of something.\n\nYour goal for employment is to find the highest and best use of your time. For example...you might be qualified for the following jobs:\n\n$10/hour Fast Food Cashier\n\n$15/hour CostCo employee\n\n$25/hour Bank of America Teller\n\n$50/hour Plumber/Electrician\n\nIn each of those scenarios, you're giving up an hour of your time, but the value that you get is very different across those roles.\n\nIf you're only qualified for the first 2 jobs, then your goal is to figure out what training/education you need to upgrade your options.\n\nA bigger problem right now is that for quite a while now there4 have been more people graduating college than are needed for jobs that require a college degree. Since there are so many more people with college degrees out there than there are jobs that need college degrees, it means that people without college degrees are competing against people with college degrees for jobs that don't require college degrees. And since those people with college degrees largely have student loans and HAVE to work or else they will default on those loans, employers can get away with hiring college grads for cheap in jobs where someone doesn't really need a degree...and that relegates people who just have HS degrees and no other training to basic service jobs. And if you don't have a HS diploma/GED, fahgeddaboudit.\n\nSo if you find yourself struggling to make money, you need to do a real inventory of your skills, spend some time researching what various jobs pay (including any benefits, which have real value by the way) and see where there's overlap\n\nIncome generally doesn't just happen...you are far more likely to get the income you want if you make a plan for how to get there and then take steps down that path. It may take a while, but it'll probably happen because most other people don't make that plan.\n\nGood luck to you!\n\nedit:\n\nFor me, I grew up poor, but did very well in school. Prior to meeting my wife, I almost always have 2-4 roommates and was able to live cheaply and/or save because splitting bills 3+ ways generally is a good strategy for keeping living expenses low.\n\nI eventually got a master's degree from a well-regarded school, and started a business. I struggled to make money in that business for a decade. After 10 years, I decided to change directions and switch industries. During that time, I'd met and gotten to know a lot of people. One of them had several businesses and recognized that I was talented and referred me to a company that he knew was hiring. I started at a salary that was less than I was worth ($72k), and earned meaningful raises. I distinguished myself (provided a lot more value than he was paying for) while there and learned a new industry. I worked there for 10 years until I was making about $275k per year. At that point, I was still underpaid and for that and other reasons I quit. I now work for myself making comparable money in the same industry, and have a flexible schedule that allows me to spend more time with my family.",

I consider passive savings to be the same as passive income ( or better since it‚Äôs not subject to income taxes). I earn about $3000 per year in cash back on credit card spend by using the ‚Äúright‚Äù card for most of my purchases.\n\nI started a lending business that required some up front work in underwriting clients, and about 30 minutes of ongoing work each week (so technically not totally passive) that made about $30k the first year, and was up to $100k by the 4th year. It‚Äôs year 7 now and the income is back down to around $65k a year.\n\nI used to post articles on eHow that would generate $30-$40 per month collectively.\n\nI‚Äôve subscribed to a site that lists class action lawsuit settlements, and when I see one I qualify for I join the settlement. Classaction.org\n\nI‚Äôve checked my name on the abandoned property websites maintained by the states I‚Äôve lived in and found some lost monies I was owed.\n\nI‚Äôve done medical research studies (in college) that paid a few thousand. Not totally passive, but not exactly work either.\n\nOnce upon a time there was a service called Earny‚Ä¶you‚Äôd sign up and give access to your email account and it would track online purchases made at retailers that offered a price match if the price you paid for something dropped within X days of your purchase. Sometimes that price protection was offered by a store, but it was also a feature of some of the premium credit cards. After signing up, I‚Äôd literally just get checks on the mail to deposit. I don‚Äôt believe that service still exists.\n\nI knew someone who worked at a coin collector who would pay a premium for certain collectible sets that would go on sale at a mint. As an example a set might cost $3200 from the mint (available in limited quantities), his company would offer $100-$200 above that, and I‚Äôd buy it in my credit card (getting $30 worth of cashback in addition to the cost plus premium paid back to me by his company). A bunch of us would do that‚Ä¶apparently the coin collector was looking for pieces that were ‚Äúperfect‚Äù quality in those sets that would fetch a far higher premium and he was still able to unload the new sets we ordered for a profit no matter what. That was like 20 years ago.\n\nI‚Äôm sure there have been other things over the years. I haven‚Äôt done any video content creation, digital agency work, or guides/eBooks. Never tried dropshipping either.",

It‚Äôs easy to spread yourself too thin trying every method (digital products, affiliate links, stocks, etc.)  and end up with nothing sustainable. The key is to focus on one or two income streams, master them, and automate as much as possible before adding anything else.\n\nI started in print on demand 4 years ago and have been succesful in this. I consistently make 10-20 sales per week with POD. I started digital marketing in April of this year, and after a lot of tweaks, I have been seeing sales in this area also.

          "body": "This is actually the right mindset to have. Passive income isn‚Äôt about getting rich overnight, it‚Äôs about building something once and letting it keep working for you over time. One of the most approachable places to start is digital products. You can create planners, templates, or ebooks using beginner-friendly tools and list them on platforms like Gumroad or Etsy. Once they‚Äôre uploaded, they can generate income without requiring constant active work.\n\nPrint-on-demand is another great option if you want something scalable without having to handle inventory. You design products like T-shirts, hoodies, or mugs, and the platform takes care of the printing and shipping. It‚Äôs simple to start and can run in the background once your store is up.\n\nAffiliate marketing is a strong choice if you‚Äôre interested in recommending products. You share links, and when someone makes a purchase through your link, you earn a commission. When paired with content like a blog, newsletter, or social media, this can turn into a reliable income stream.\n\nStarting a YouTube channel is one of the most powerful ways to build something long-term. You don‚Äôt have to be on camera if you‚Äôre not comfortable with it, and there are tools that make voiceovers and editing simple. Once your channel gains traction, it can bring in income through ads, affiliate links, sponsorships, and even your own products.\n\nYou could also explore freelancing or offering digital services as a way to build initial capital while working on more passive streams. And for a long-term foundation, investing in things like index funds or dividend-paying stocks can be a smart move to grow your income steadily.\n\nThe key is to pick one lane to start, build momentum, and layer in other streams over time. That‚Äôs how people create real freedom without needing to hustle endlessly.\n\nI cover all the strategies to build an online income business in my newsletter. Visit my newsletter, link in my bio.",

My goal is to be 100% transparent about the work, the costs, and the mistakes.\n\n**The Niche:** I chose niche \"vintage camera repair\"\\] because I had a personal interest in it, but I also saw low-competition keywords.\n\n**The Strategy (The \"Passive\" Part):** The income is \"passive\" now, but it took a year of very active, upfront work.\n\n1. **Content:** Wrote 50 high-quality, SEO-optimized articles (avg. 1,500 words).\n2. **Monetization:** Started with display ads (Ezoic/Mediavine) once I hit traffic thresholds.\n3. **Affiliate Links:** Added affiliate links for \\[Products related to the niche, e.g., \"camera parts, specific tools\"\\].\n\n**The Numbers (Approx.):**\n\n* **Month 1-6:** $0 - $20/mo (The \"Google Sandbox\" is real)\n* **Month 7-9:** $100/mo (Traffic started picking up)\n* **Month 10-12:** $300 - $500/mo (Hit ad threshold, articles ranking)\n\n**Total Upfront Cost:**\n\n* Domain: $10\n* Hosting: $120 (for the year)\n* SEO Tool (optional): $99/mo (I used it for 3 months)\n* **Total:** \\~$430\n\n**My Biggest Mistake:** Wasting the first 3 months writing about topics *I* thought were interesting instead of what people were *actually* searching for. Keyword research is everything.\n\n**What's Next:** I now spend about 2-3 hours a month just updating plugins and maybe adding one new article. It's not \"set it and forget it,\" but it's highly leveraged.\n\nI hope this breakdown is helpful for anyone starting out.\n\n**What's the biggest \"mistake\" you made early in your passive income journey that you wish you could go back and fix?**",

Everyone has unfair advantages‚Äîconnections, skills, personality traits, timing, geography, family, even struggles that shaped resilience.\n\nThe ones who win are not the ones who play ‚Äúfair,‚Äù but the ones who double down on their edges.\n\nIf you have charisma ‚Üí leverage it to build a network faster.\n\nIf you grew up broke ‚Üí leverage your survival mindset, you already know how to stretch resources.\n\nIf you‚Äôre in tech ‚Üí leverage your ability to automate, build, and scale faster than 90% of the world.\n\nIf you‚Äôre in a city with opportunity ‚Üí leverage proximity, go to every meetup, knock on doors others can‚Äôt reach.\n\nIf you know how to write/speak well ‚Üí leverage content, make your words work 24/7 online.\n\n\nStop waiting for permission, stop wishing you had what others have. Take inventory of YOUR unfair edges and lean on them shamelessly. Let‚Äôs say, start a business with platform like Sitefy and gpt. That‚Äôs how people actually pull ahead.\n\nQuestion: What‚Äôs an unfair advantage YOU have that you‚Äôre underutilizing right now?",

You can cashout via crypto or paypal as low as 0.5$ for ur first cashouts which is very good to test it out.",

My passive income project had its \"best day ever\" with a $400 sale, which turned out to be a fraud attack.\n\nI almost got hit with hundreds in chargeback fees ($15 per transaction!) on top of the lost sale.\n\nThe scary part? This happened because Stripe's most important fraud-prevention settings are OFF by default.\n\nHere's the 3-minute fix to protect yourself:\n\n* Go to your Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Radar ‚Üí Rules.\n* Find and ENABLE the rules to BLOCK payments if:\n   1. CVC verification fails\n   2. Postal code verification fails\n* For ultimate protection, enable 3D Secure (3DS) in your payment settings. This shifts fraud liability from you to the bank, so you're covered.\n\nI caught it in time, but it was a massive wake-up call. Don't learn this lesson the expensive way.\n\nI wrote a full post-mortem on what happened, the exact fraud pattern to look for, and a step-by-step guide with screenshots on my blog.\n\nFull Story &amp; Guide:¬†[https://choy.in/blog/stripe-is-dangerous](https://choy.in/blog/stripe-is-dangerous)\n\nHope this helps someone avoid a disaster!",

That's *active* emotional and financial work.\n* **Real Estate?** You have to find the deal, secure financing, fix toilets (or manage the property manager who does).\n* **Niche Site?** You have to build it, write content, do SEO, and maintain it.\n* **SaaS/App?** You have to code it, market it, and handle customer support.\n\nWhat we're all chasing is **Leveraged Income**: The ability to de-link our time from our earnings. You do the work *once*, and it continues to pay you 10, 100, or 1000 times over. A blog post you write today can earn ad revenue for 5 years.\n\nCalling it \"passive\" implies no work. Calling it \"leveraged\" respects the (often massive) upfront effort.\n\nChanging my mindset from \"passive\" to \"leveraged\" helped me focus on building *systems and assets*, not just looking for a magic money button.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way?

Traffic and trust come from posting valuable content regularly, whatever valuable means to your customer, financial or emotional. Storytelling helps you explain the benefits to the customer, meaning what benefit they might receive, based on past stories and testimonials. Typically what they receive is a personal transformation, a new self. Sales is a matter of testing, using authoritative framing and tone, and relating to the customer, to find out why they as an individual need this. Trust is important in sales, but that's already built up with content in the traffic funnel. Once they trust you and they're interested in the product, it's then a matter of getting them to convince themselves they need it, without being desperate or pushy.",

I completed the qualification and received an email on October 8th about completing an identity verification process in order to stay on Project Sonic and receive pay.\n\nPoint is, I completed the qualification task and identity verification shortly after receiving said email.\n\nI never got an email confirming that I could start working on Project Sonic (it was mentioned in the qualification email that I would get a follow-up email indicating whether I passed or not). However, when I go to the Multimango platform and login using the provided credentials from TelusInternational, I can see tasks that are available to work on (again similar to Project Coffee on Crowdgen). Does this mean I could start working now? It'd really help considering Project Coffee has been paused for many users (including myself) while they undergo quality reviews.\n\nIf I can start working on the project, how exactly will I be paid? I don't think I was able to add any payment information on my TelusInternational account nor was I prompted to use any app.\n\nAny advice/help would be appreciated.",

I've tried affiliate marketing, CPA marketing, dropshipping, e-com, SMMA, lead generation / client acquisition agencies... you name it. Some of them failed, some of them did alright, some of them did quite well.\n\nFast forward to today: I've been doing KDP for over a year now, 14 months to be precise and in that time I went from living in my car to having a full blown business with 4 full time employees.\n\nFor anyone unfamiliar Amazon KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing) is Amazon's self publishing platform where you can sell paperbacks, hard cover books, ebooks, and even audio books (through ACX). It doesn't require any upfront investment.  \nIs there a learning curve? Yes.  \nIs it worth it? ABSOLUTELY.\n\nAnd in my opinion this is one of the best and easiest online business models right now, especially for beginners, because:\n\n* You don't need to be a writer\n* You don't need a big budget\n* You can work from anywhere\n* You get access to Amazon's traffic (instead of paying for ads)\n* The books that you made continue to sell almost passively\n\nKDP isn't a \"get rich quick\" scheme, but if you're willing to learn, experiment and stay consistent, it can genuinely change your life, just like it did mine. A year ago I had nothing, today I own a real business that is still growing.\n\nI hope you guys give it a try and have success with it! YOU CAN DO IT!",

Bezos made a TON of money as an angel investor into Google.\n\nTLDR: In 1998, Amazon acquired a startup called Junglee and the acquisition was basically a disaster. But one of the employees, Ram Shriram, ended up intro‚Äôing Bezos to Larry Page and Sergey Brin. They show him a prototype, and he wrote a $250k check on the spot into their $1M seed round.\n\nFast forward to Google‚Äôs IPO in 2004, that $250k was worth $280M. If he had held on to it, that would have been $20B today (I heard that on the Acquired podcast).\n\nPretty much the reality of investing in startups. If you're already meeting smart people and building relationships, the opportunities show up in your workflow. Not from \"deal hunting.\"",

I have been to over 65 countries and spouse has been to over 100 but most of those had been vacations and done at speed.  This time around though, the experience is very different due to slow traveling.

I didn‚Äôt have a plan just curiosity and a few late nights spent looking into multiple listings.  \n  \nI began to notice patterns. Certain categories like electronics and collectibles sold quicker and had better margins. I started tracking what sold best, improving my listing descriptions , and focusing more on things like PC laptops, video cards, and even men‚Äôs shoes.  \n  \nOnce I found what was working the income became steady. It now brings in around $3k a month which still amazes me considering how it all started. But everybody has to start somewhere I guerss.  \n  \nStill learning as I go but thought Id share it here to inspire others. For those who tried it which products or niches did better for yo??",

It felt like a loss at the time but that imbalance of power never leads to good business. With hindsight, I'd probably try to introduce premiums for specific bad behaviour (e.g. last minute request fee) and stick to them religiously. Then if the customer leaves, they leave. If they stay they'll be incentivised to behave better, and who knows, maybe they will (if not you can keep increasing those premiums). I think the scenario where they accept the blanket price increase but continue behaving badly doesn't do enough to fix the issue - they'll still make your life hell.",

We sent all 12 a letter explaining that due to blah blah etc their fees moving forward **would triple**; and obviously we understood that was significant and would help them transfer to a different firm if they wished.\n\nAll 12 stayed at the new pricing. We so often undervalue ourselves - sounds like you‚Äôre set up for a win-win, good luck!",

(Which will be horrible- admittedly.)\nDuring that time focus on the basics with them and say that you want to give them the tools to make it easier for whoever they get to take over - within that 2 months).\n\nWhile this is happening- market your ass off to try get 3-4 smaller paying clients to help build the shortfall. Use the current client as reference (with their ok) or just mention it in passing in person if not. \n\nAfter this period of grind, the aim would be to have at least 3 smaller clients to make up a good bunch of what you are losing from the big one.  Going forward then try devote half a day each week if possible to marketing so you end up with no one client being more than 15% of your income.

I was in a group of people that believed in NFTs in 2017, we saw the benefits to homes represented by NFTs, cars represented by NFTs, art, it was all about cutting out the middleman, preventing fraud and provable ownership online.\n\n2021 was a bit of a up and a down. It was a great up for those that had been in the space four years a long time before real money was there. People wanted our old stuff, so we happily sold it to them.\n\nSadly instead of this amazing tech that would go hand in hand with the financial world was turned into ape pictures on TV and 69m sales of art to prop up a token / collection sale. \n\nMost of you reading this will think of NFTs as some kind of scam, which is like saying emails are a scam because of Nigerian prince emails. So we took the hit on our passions reputation for the sake of our bank accounts. That makes it sound like we had any say in the direction of things, we obviously didn‚Äôt. \n\nPersonally I got to a million via gambling, identified a way to turn myself into the house rather than the casino, expanded, found others doing it, expanded even further. Stopped with Covid, when NFTs took over.\n\nOf our group of ~15, three broke $100m, one via selling their shares in a company they founded and two via huge collections of what became grails.\n\nMost broke above $5m, all above $1m. It was a bit like early bitcoiners who weren‚Äôt investing (or spending on drugs etc), but playing around, it wasn‚Äôt for money, then in four short years it became.\n\nWhen you are right, you‚Äôre right.",

They list all sorts of requirements that scare most good people off; entry level jobs needing experience, niche tools that are not well known but similar to other tools being used in the field.\n\nEmployers have, in an effort to handle the endless amounts of applications they could get online, made job searching a complete sham with the unreasonable requirements. The only people that get to the interview part are people who are overqualified or lie like this guy. Networking is the only honest way left and a lot of the times it leads to someone that doesn't know all the tools but is \"solid\" and \"trustworthy.\"\n\nMy advice if you want it, reduce requirements and do contract to hire.",

It's less about volume and more about relevance.\n\n\n\nThat said, it's a grind and the ROI can be questionable when you factor in your time. Some folks get traction, but they're usually in specific B2B niches where decision makers actually check email.\n\n\n\nOut of curiosity, what kind of service/product were you pitching, and were you targeting a specific industry or just casting a wide net?",

          "body": "Yeah we actually get better results with email and LinkedIn than we do with calling, I assume because it‚Äôs easier to ignore an email or LinkedIn message than tell a good cold caller to fuck off. 300 isn‚Äôt a ton of emails, and getting one or two good replies off that seems reasonable. The thing is that when you use list building tools and a good deliverability setup you can easily send thousands of emails per month and convert anywhere from 0.5%-5% to warm leads depending on how targeted and exciting your offer is. Say 10% of the warm leads buy, you back into needing to send 1,000 emails and talk to 10 people to close a deal. Call that $500 in tech costs and a day of work to net a deal. If you‚Äôre shooting for the standard grifter/new B2B service rate of $1,500 all in first contract value this puts you in the money as long as you have decent COGS. I would avoid email for B2C services and anything with less than $1K LTV in terms of gross profit - so once you‚Äôve netted out your expenses to fulfill the service your price needs to be $1,000 more than that. Assuming your customers will eventually buy again if they have success, or some sort of recurring relationship, worst case you‚Äôre shooting to conservatively break even on the initial contract once you factor in COGS and CAC and a fair market value for your time spent selling and seeking to profit off of retentions referrals and upsells.\n\nShoot for 95% deliverability, 30-40% open rates, and 25% of your replies being positive. Any metric substantially below these is killing you. Too much bounce -&gt; spam. Nobody opens your email -&gt; spam. People aren‚Äôt happy they got it -&gt; also spam. Keep in mind there‚Äôs an artificial 10% open rate baseline generated by programmatic clicks such as the inbox scanning links for malicious activity - so a 10% open rate means nobody is opening your email and a 20% open rate means 10% of people are. This is why youre shooting for 30-40 and 20% isn‚Äôt as good as it looks. If your bounce rate is over 5% scrub with neverbounce and keep valid emails and catch all emails, discard invalids and unknowns. End your emails with a question geared to start a conversation instead of asking for a meeting if response rates/happy responses are feeling too low.",

Rest of the copy ( Everyone claims copy is the pinnacle, I claim offer is the pinnacle, nobody will read the rest of your copy if your offer doesn‚Äôt resonate)\n4. Volume ( If you‚Äôve managed to nail down your copy, leads, the copy all that‚Äôs left is to add volume ).\n\nAlthough many say that volume is the way to start, sure, it works but it can rack up the bill pretty quick for someone just starting out on email.",

      "selftext": "\nWhen I first started buying companies, I didn‚Äôt have investors, fancy financing, or any kind of silver spoon. What I did have was time, curiosity, and a willingness to talk to business owners who wanted to retire. Over time I figured out that most people selling good companies don‚Äôt care about finding the highest bidder. They care about finding someone who will take care of what they built. That shift in thinking is what made everything possible.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned from actually buying businesses with limited capital in 2025.\n\nI look for companies that are simple and steady. No hype. No startups(unless we think we can make something work with the existing owner staying on full time). I like plumbing, concrete, restoration, logistics, small manufacturing, marketing agencies with retainers, and local service companies that people rely on every week. They‚Äôre not glamorous, but they make consistent money and they‚Äôve usually been run by the same person for twenty or thirty years. Those owners are tired. They want to slow down, but they also want to know their employees and customers will be taken care of.\n\nI build my own list. I pick an industry, use Google Maps, and write down every company that looks active. Then I just reach out. I‚Äôll call or email the owner and say something like, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôve followed your business for a while and really respect what you‚Äôve built. I own and operate a couple small companies and was wondering if you‚Äôve ever thought about stepping back or bringing someone on to help with the next stage.‚Äù That‚Äôs it. No big sales pitch. Just a human conversation.\n\nMost people say no the first time and second time. Some never call back. But a few will talk. And those few conversations are where all the good deals come from. I keep track of everyone I contact and follow up every few months. Timing is everything.\n\nOnce a conversation turns serious, structure matters more than anything. I‚Äôve used seller financing in nearly every deal I‚Äôve done. One deal went like this: $1 million purchase price, $100k down, $500k SBA loan, and the seller carried $400k at five percent interest for five years. They liked the idea of getting paid over time instead of walking away. It gave me enough breathing room to run the business right.\n\nIf I don‚Äôt have the down payment, I find a partner who‚Äôs comfortable lending it in exchange for interest or a small profit share. I keep control by structuring it as a loan, not equity. That kind of creativity gets deals done without losing ownership. That said I always want an active partner. No passive guys - not worth the headache. \n\nI always talk to banks before I need them. I‚Äôll call local SBA lenders and ask what they like to see from borrowers. They‚Äôll tell you exactly how they think. That‚Äôs free education. When you finally bring them a real opportunity, you already know how to package it so they can say yes. Also keep in mind some of the local banks aren‚Äôt really SBA. \n\nDue diligence is where most buyers get lazy. I don‚Äôt. I ask for tax returns, bank statements, vendor lists, customer breakdowns, and payroll reports. I compare deposits to income. I verify that employees are real and staying on. I want no surprises after closing.\n\nWhen I negotiate, I care more about structure than price. I‚Äôll ask for a few months of interest-only payments or a transition period where the seller helps part-time. Those little details protect cash flow while you learn. Sellers usually say yes because it helps everyone succeed.\n\nIf you want to get started, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do right now.\n\nWeek 1: pick one or two industries you understand. Build a list of 25 businesses in your area.\nWeek 2: call or email 10 owners. Get two real conversations.\nWeek 3: ask one of them for basic financials. Build a rough deal model just to practice.\nWeek 4: talk to one SBA lender and ask what it would take to fund a deal like that.\n\nThen repeat the cycle every month. If you stay consistent for 90 days, you‚Äôll have real leads, real numbers, and one or two sellers who are thinking about it.\n\nBuying a business with limited capital isn‚Äôt magic. It‚Äôs process, patience, and communication. The 2025 market is full of retiring owners who want someone capable to take over. If you can listen, plan, and follow through, you can become that person.\n\nIf anyone wants to talk through how to start, how to reach out to sellers, or what to look for in a deal, drop your questions. I‚Äôm happy to share what‚Äôs worked for me.\n\nDr Connor Robertson",

          "body": "I hear the mix of grit and patience in your post, and I can relate to that tired but hopeful place where you want to do the right thing and need practical steps to get there. I have started and lost businesses, had marketplace accounts shut down, and poured a year into a project that failed, and that cycle taught me to favor steady, repeatable systems over chasing quick wins. I also spent years bouncing between ideas, battled binge drinking, and have been maintaining sobriety while rebuilding focus, so I know how clarity and structure feel when they finally click. I once found purpose again coaching kids, and that piece of meaning helped me steady my next moves. I share that because your approach of listening to retiring owners and valuing structure resonates with how I rebuilt my work life. \n\nHere are simple, concrete steps you can use right away: start by building a local list of 25 businesses and use a short, human outreach script to get two real conversations this month, talk to at least one lender now to learn what documents they need so you can model a clean deal later, insist on seller financing or convert a partner contribution into a loan so you keep control while preserving cash flow, and create a due diligence checklist to verify payroll, deposits, and customer concentration before you sign. Keep notes, follow up every 90 days, and protect a short transition period with interest only payments while you learn the business. I admire your patience and the listening mindset you described, and if you want to run a real outreach script or a deal model together I am happy to help. Small consistent actions win. \n\nAustin Erkl - Entrepreneur Coach",

      "selftext": "# \"Comfort is the worst addiction\" - Marcus Aurelius\n\nI think some of you might relate to this, some of you might learn from my mistakes.\n\nSince I was 15-16 years old I did every business model you can think of: forex, stock trading, affiliate marketing, SEO blogs, dropshipping, customer acquisition/lead generation agency, CPA marketing, SMMA, POD, Amazon FBA, Amazon Merch, Amazon KDP... you name it. I wasn't afraid of work, I wasn't afraid of risk, I was disciplined.\n\nBut in 2020 everything collapsed around me.\n\n* My Amazon KDP account got banned (how I was earning money at that time)\n* I broke up with my girlfriend\n* One of my closest friends and my accountability partner passed away\n\nI still had around $150k saved up, so financially I was comfortable, that's where my life really fell apart.\n\nI though I'll have a few months off to reset, but that turned into five years of comfort, depression, procrastination and avoidance. Having no pressure and no accountability I sliped into all the easiest escaped of all, video games, distractions, mindless media, short dopamine hits, ZERO DISCIPLINE. I told myself \"I would start again tomorrow\", \"...next week\", ...next month\"...\n\nComfort was my drug. The worst part is that it didn't feel harmful at the time, but it was killing my ambition.\n\nThen life hit me again. In early 2024, a series of unexpected expenses wiped me down to \\~$15k and shortly after, I got hit with a fine from an old dropshippping project where my business partner screwed me over. I went from comfortable... to broke... to in debt.\n\nBut that pain made me wake up. It brought back the hunger that comfort had stolen from me.\n\nI returned to Amazon KDP with purpose and I managed to build a decent business and because of it I am going to pay off my debt by the end of this year.\n\nI'm sharing this because some of you are in the exact danger zone that I lived in. Enough comfort to survive, not enough pain to change, slowly dying inside while calling it \"rest\", \"balance\" or \"taking time\".  \nComfort isn't rest, it is a cage with pillows.\n\nSo if you're building your business now, procrastinating your next project or thinking about quitting.¬†**LEAN INTO THE DISCOMFORT**. That is where all the progress lives.\n\nI wasted 5 years of my life learning this the hard way. I just hope that even one person who reads this, avoids the same trap that got me.",

I feel like a lot of people give it a lot of different names But the one I've liked the most is. **thinking on a long time horizon** or \"***What will the actions I've done today get me, multiplied by two years? Where will i be? What will i have?\"*** It helps you realize that all you really are is a series of inputs and actions. I'm not saying you can't enjoy video games, Or even enjoy a TV show and so on. But it's the level of severity that matters, Playing an hour of a video game after a long stay of work can feel fantastic. We're playing 6 to 8 hours for eight days in a row? Where will that get you in two years? But if you look at your life as merely actions that will eventually amount to something, it can make things clear On what you'll need to do to increase the percentage chance you'll succeed or have the life you want. and when you think about it like that, **the game of life becomes clear**. In order to play the game you need to ***flip the coin as many times as possible***, Knowing full well you'll fail. The second thing you'll need is an ***understanding of how to flip the coin In a better way***, The aggregation of skills.

I would recommend no to stage the event around a party or drinks. You can give them under a very control system like one drink like a beer for every person. No hard drinks and please set a reasonable ending time. Lite 6 o 7 pm. After that if the people want to go out or go into a party its going to be their responsibility of course outside of the office. \n\nCheers and good luck",

The more frequent the problem the better. As Alex Hormozi says look for pain that happens every day or every week not once a year. That way your business lives in people‚Äôs day to day life not their once a year wish list.\n\nJeff Bezos used to say build around things that never change. People will always want convenience trust good service and something that saves them time or makes them feel good. When you build for what stays true you don‚Äôt need to chase trends. Build around those timeless needs instead of chasing trends.\n\nAnd because you‚Äôre introverted we already have the patience to think deeply and build quietly. That‚Äôs a strength. We don‚Äôt need to shout just solve something meaningful and let your work speak. We just need to help a few people really well.\n\nStart small. Observe deeply. Build patiently.

That validates whether there's demand before you invest time building infrastructure.\n\nOur clients who overthink \"how to start\" before doing anything usually never start. They research endlessly, plan perfectly, then get paralyzed by fear. Just pick something small and try selling it to one person. That teaches you more than any advice.\n\nCollege students have built-in advantages for starting businesses. You have a network of peers, low living expenses, and time to experiment. Use those instead of focusing on limitations like being introverted.\n\nCommon beginner businesses for college students: freelance services (writing, design, tutoring), dropshipping or selling products online, campus-focused services. Pick something with low startup costs so failure doesn't hurt financially.\n\nStop looking for permission or the perfect plan. Just start selling something, even if it's imperfect. You'll learn what works through real experience way faster than reading about how to start.\n\nBeing introverted might actually help because you'll focus on systems and processes instead of relying purely on personality to sell. Plenty of successful online businesses run by introverts who never meet customers face-to-face.\n\nPick something, offer it to 10 people, see what happens. That's your starting point, not endless research on how to begin.",

At the moment she's a nail technician as well, and also takes on the manager role (maintenance, supplies, etc), and she's built up clientele and the like, to the point where she herself is pulling in $300k+ profit herself a year. The thing is, she plans to sell the spot in a couple years, and plans to sell it someone else who will take over it as a nail salon business, but for some reason in her mind it's ingrained to sell it simply at the cost of the location (not accounting for the cost of the business she built up, etc). Is this a bad idea on her part in her opinion? I definitely don't want to think for her, but I was curious about what you guys think\n\n  \nEdit: the new owner would just take on the name and clients, and she'll no longer be in the nail business",

If she has a longer-term lease locked in, this has value, especially for someone who wants to continue substantially the same business if there's a built-up clientele.  One assumes many of the techs and other employees would be willing to stay on with any reasonable new owner, so this really is a turnkey business your mom is handing over. \n\nIf the lease is short-term and there aren't clean renewal options at a fixed or structured price, she has a decision to make:  does she want to walk away without being able to sell it for too much, or would she want to get the landlord to agree to a lease extension, or option, that would enable her to bundle the sale per above.\n\nIf she owns the building, she should keep the building and become a landlord to the new owner, at the very least. Landlords in this situation have a lot of leverage, so even if she sells the business itself below market, then she could make up for it in time through reasonable rent increases.  \n\nIf owns but is planning to sell the building, my advice to you is, buy it and offer the new salon owner a long-term lease on terms that work for you both!

As a potential owner, I am looking only at the profit from the other nail techs, if the current owner works, Ill add 40% of their earnings minus 20% (to account for tips) to the profit calculation. Then Ill look at the size of the salon, and the condition of the salon, and location of the salon. In particular I want to know how many nail techs there are in the salon, how many are staying. The more nail techs the more valuable the business. Also I want to know how many pedicures chairs the salon has, and the condition of the pedicure chairs. A pedicure chair can cost up to 10k to install plus the cost of the chair itself 1.5 to 4k. If the if the salon's chairs and furniture are too old that would decrease the value. \n\nYou haven't really given much valuable information to determine a prize. It could be as low as 100k or as high as 500k. You won't get 3x profits like some others suggest. My current place makes me 250k and I bought for 80k, I hope to sell it for 100k in a couple of years.",

      "selftext": "I‚Äôve always been interested in entrepreneurship and like a lot of people have echoed in this sub, despite the long hours, the stress, and the dark days, I‚Äôd way rather work towards building something that lasts a lifetime rather than show up lifeless everyday to a 9-5 job with a secure paycheck and then retire by 65.  \n\nBut with that being said, I just need to rant a bit about YouTubers / ‚ÄúGurus‚Äù. \n\nThe way they paint the process of running a  business as so glamorous and full of sunshine, rainbows, and instant financial freedom is terrible for the mindset of anybody looking to get into business. \n\nYou‚Äôll see a drop shipping YouTuber showing you screenshots of $100,000 revenue months, but you won‚Äôt see that the same product that is being sold is rated 2.8 stars on Amazon because it‚Äôs cheap Chinese garbage, so therefore you aren‚Äôt being told how many customer return requests there are or how razor thin the margins are after ad costs, shipping, fulfillment agents, and other OPEX. \n\nIt‚Äôs the same fluff with AI agents. The whole promise is minimal effort (‚Äúget started in a day‚Äù) and boom, you have a $50,000 a month business. \n\nI‚Äôm not saying that there is no potential for success using any of these mediums - but rather there is soooo much work, research, and understanding of the customer that goes into forming a successful, and more importantly, lasting business.\n\nThere‚Äôs a reason why there are more 9-5 workers than business owners. A tale as old as time: ‚ÄúIf it were easy, everyone would do it‚Äù. \n\nTherefore, if you are trying to rush things because you are feeling left out of the ‚ÄúAI gold rush‚Äù or whatever the new ‚Äúbig opportunity‚Äù is, just remember business is a marathon, not a sprint as it portrayed so much on the internet today by people simply trying to sell you on a course. \n\nNobody in their right mind putting up those big numbers is going to have the time or energy to start a course and make 3 hour long YouTube videos about it. Remember that. \n\nCorrect me if I‚Äôm wrong on any of this but over the past 5ish years of trial, error, and observation, that has been my understanding.\n",

Comment 'Shorts' and blah blah blah\"\n\nI called them out on it because my shorts consistently get millions of views and I know the math. That was NOT a real screencap. Of course they hid my comment. \n\nAnyway, I pretty much focus on providing as much evidence as I can for my course like 'here's my results, heres my channel, go look for yourself, if you want to learn how i make my shorts, take my course'\n\nNot in those words but you know what I mean. Everything sucks so bad these days you cant trust anyone.. and now, companies are making Ai UGC ads!?\n\nLike fake people talking about how they use their product. Not actors, not influencers, and definitely not real customers. Just Ai. I hope some day the hammer drops and every business that made Ai UGC ads unethically (meaning not disclosed ai) gets publicly shamed.\n\nSorry. I did not expect this rant to come out.\n\nAll that said, some of the people ive learned the most from are called 'gurus'\n\nLike Hormozi. I have his books. Man I have learned so much from those damn things. Russell Brunson too.\n\nSome people start to get tired of the content these advice givers put out because they say 'its all the same shit!' And they're right. When people like that start to sound repetitive, it means youre done learning what they have to say.\n\nAs someone whos been called a Youtube Guru, Ive been accused of saying the same thing over and over and it was true. Either because new youtubers would ask me the same questions on livestreams, or because theres only so much advice to give. The talking points dont change very often.\n\nAnyway, this comment got away from me. When I get tired of someone's advice, I stop watching.

This year, thanks to AI especially, our engineering team was able to move atleast 2x faster, and we were able to do a lot of stuff that we used outsource to contractors on Upwork/Fiverr in house. I just pulled up our Mercury report and here are all the new tools we have been paying for this year\n\n1. Cursor and Windsurf: Everyone in our team gets either Cursor or Windsurf paid for. I am personally a huge fan of Windsurf cascade agent. Its been able to make huge changes to our app on it own from simple prompts. We mostly just have to test the changes, review the code and just push it to deployment lately. Our team is moving definitely 2x faster with the same headcount. We use the Sonnet model almost unanimously inside our old!\n2. Google Nano Banana &amp; Veo 3: We used to hire contractors to make product images, photoshoots, videos for social media/ads etc. Google Nano Banana has mostly replaced all of that. It is great how it can take a product and change colors etc, and turn it into full blown photoshoots with models etc in seconds. And then you can just use it as a first frame in Veo 3 to make a full video/reel from it. Crazy!\n3. Frizerly: Its a great AI agent that learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website helping us improve our Google ranking. Saves me and my team 10+ hours every week!¬†We used to hire contractors on Fiverr/Upwork earlier for this!\n4. Intercom Fin: We had an issue where whatever we do and document on our website, people kept asking some obvious questions on chat taking up valuable support bandwidth. Now Fin can auto resolve these questions instantly. Other questions get auto routed to real people so that people are not mad as well!¬†!¬†\n5. Lovable &amp; Bolt: Our marketing team now quickly spins up landing pages, lead gens using Lovable/Bolt instead of having to wait for engineering or external contractors. It's not great complex apps for SAAS etc but it's great for marketing landing pages, and simple stuff!¬†\n6. ChatGPT: Obvious, but everyone in our team gets ChatGPT to brainstorm, summarize reports etc\n7. N8N: To automate lots of workflows inside our org.\n\nCurious what others are using tho!",

For us, all of this changed how we run outbound. Half our stack now runs on autopilot\n\nHere's a small breakdown:\n\n1. **Smartlead + n8n:** We used to spend hours checking deliverability, tagging campaigns, and updating reports manually. Now everything flows through n8n, from Smartlead data to Slack summaries. Each AM saves around 6 hours a week.\n2. **Supabase + Clay:** Our Apollo data lives inside Supabase, and Clay is our main research engine. It enriches and segments leads automatically instead of relying on VAs. Lead quality and positive replies both went up noticeably.\n3. **Claude + Claude Projects:** We use Claude for thinking, writing, and debugging ideas. Its Projects feature is perfect for keeping consistent tone across client reports and campaign analyses. It replaced hours of doc writing and alignment calls.\n4. **Lovable / Codex / Cursor / Bolt:** Still experimenting with these to build our internal reporting and client dashboards. The goal is a fully ‚Äúvibecoded‚Äù platform that looks great but runs straight on live campaign data from our DB.\n5. **Slack + custom bots:** Every campaign‚Äôs health, domain status, and weekly CDRs now post directly to Slack. No dashboards to check, no files to pull. Keeps the team synced in real time.\n\nThis year has been more about wiring everything together using the small pieces that have been out in the market and gained enough stability to not break our systems. \n\nOverall, all of this implmented results in the systems running smoothly and the team focussing only on thinking and strategy.",

So convince them to go away by being expensive. The ones who value your work will pay for your value.\n\nThe other thing I made sure to do is there are customers who haggle everything.  It's who they are. Typically they are fresh from countries where you DO haggle everything.  They are not bad customers, but they want to haggle. So after that first time I went into my computer and raised their rates 10% for parts and labor.  Then I would let them \"haggle\" me down to my normal rates.  I got what I wanted, they got what they wanted.",

Multiple interactions: \n\n\n\n-*\"If I buy two, will you give me the second for half price?\"*  (Dude...) the guy I sold a 100 units to just now, didn't get a single dollar off. (What makes you think your measly two piece order is going to sway me?) \n\n\n\n-*\"If I buy a dozen, how much will you give it to me for?\"* Same price as labeled (in bold 250 point font on the product itself, need me to read it to you fuck face!?!)  *\"Ok, if I buy ten of these, how much for me?\"* (Again,) if you take one or a hundred, the price is the same. *\"What about if I take 30 pieces of this one, how much for me?\"* (OMFG!!  I start blinking slower and narrow my eyes a bit) If you order a truck container's worth of product, pay it in full up front, and wait 2-3 months, and agree to storage fees if you don't pick up immediately, I can give you a decent discount. \n\n\n\n-*\"But I always get a lower price than this\"* (No one does) Only the boss can give you a discount, he's on vacation, and returns next month, you can come back then. *\"No that's ok, I need it now\"* (If you clean up my inventory at a discount, I too need to replenish now, but my NOW is going to take 2-3 months to get my order from China. So selling at a discount is not to our benefit) \n\n\n\nWhen I start getting tired of them, I actually send them to my competitor without directly saying gtfo. They come back and pay my asking price without any more haggling.\n\nEdit: Just yesterday. I had a guy who was from our same hometown in Syria. Never met him before here. He thinks because we're both Syrian, he's going to convince me with his bullshit. He wanted to invest his money, and take zero risk. That he wanted to take 10 units of our product, he wants it at a discount, AND (here's the kicker) wants it on consignment, so that if he doesn't re-sell the product successfully, he can return it and get his money back even though we have 5 signs All Sales Final and No Returns No Exchange signs spread out across our showroom. This one in particular was kinda fun to knock him off his high horse watching him deflate when I wouldn't budge on any of his negotiation attempts.",

For three years I kept walk in hours because I thought thats what customers wanted and I was terrified of losing business.\n\nThe reality was way different tho. Id have people walk in right when Im in the middle of a hem on a wedding dress, or Id block out time to finish rush orders and then spend 45 minutes with someone who just wanted to ask if I could fix their jacket zipper (which I dont even do). My actual turnaround times were getting worse because I couldnt focus.\n\nI spent like two months researching what other alterations places were doing, talked to my regular customers, even checked polymarket to see what the recession odds were since I was worried people would stop spending on alterations if the economy tanked. But mostly I just tracked my own numbers for a month and realized that 60% of walk ins either didnt book anything or wanted services I dont offer.\n\nMade the switch to appointment only in September. Put up signs, updated my google business, sent emails to my regular clients. First week I was stressed as hell thinking my phone would stop ringing.\n\nOpposite happened. My schedule is actually FULLER now because people book in advance and I can plan my day properly. Im finishing work faster, taking on more jobs, and honestly my stress levels dropped like crazy. Plus the clients who book appointments tend to be more serious and respectful of my time.\n\nOnly downside is I do get the occasional person who shows up anyway and gets annoyed when I cant help them right then. But honestly thats on them for not reading the giant sign on my door lol\n\nIf youre on the fence about this just do it.

Most orgs consider the cost of redundant infrastructure and assume there will be rare outages and that is just the cost of doing business. \n\nBut even when I managed colo in geographically separate data centers no one wanted to pay for true redundancy because it means having the gear hot at independent locations - that's not a cloud problem. \n\nMoreover, that gear is worthless if you aren't routinely testing it and running it as production gear occasionally. \n\nDoctora still have pagers not because they can't get alerts to cell phones, but because it's an i dependent band to be contacted on.

Some months I‚Äôd earn just enough to get by, and other times I‚Äôd go an entire month without a single project. That kind of uncertainty really messes with your head. Even now that I have a full-time job, those quiet months still haunt me. There‚Äôs this weird mix of relief and fear. Relief that things are stable now, but fear that it could go back to that at any moment.\n\nI think what helped me most back then was learning to detach my worth from my income. Because when you‚Äôre self-employed, it‚Äôs so easy to take a slow month personally like it‚Äôs a reflection of how good you are. It‚Äôs not. Sometimes it‚Äôs just timing, or algorithms, or people‚Äôs budgets drying up. I used to open my laptop at 2 a.m. thinking maybe a client had messaged me back lol spoiler, they hadn‚Äôt. \n\nI eventually started a small studio (we offer full social media management for $79/month) because I didn‚Äôt want to go through that cycle alone anymore. We started small, helping other freelancers and small business owners manage their social media for an affordable rate. It wasn‚Äôt even about the money at first, just building something steady while helping others who were going through the same grind.\n\nYou do get better at living with it, I think. The anxiety doesn‚Äôt disappear, but it becomes more manageable once you start recognizing the patterns. The highs don‚Äôt make you cocky, and the lows don‚Äôt make you spiral, they just become part of the rhythm. ;)",

I‚Äôve been putting a lot of effort into my account by posting regularly, creating reels, using hashtags but growth has been painfully slow.\n\nEDIT: Thanks everyone, based on these recommendations I‚Äôve decided to buy Instagram followers with StillViral, and so far so good! I‚Äôll keep you updated on how it goes.  \n  \nI‚Äôm considering trying to buy Instagram followers just to give my profile a small boost, but my main concern is safety. I‚Äôve read that if you buy from the wrong site especially those that use bots, your account could get flagged or the followers will just disappear in a few days.\n\nHas anyone here found a legit site that provides real looking followers that actually stay? I‚Äôd really appreciate hearing which service you used and whether it felt worth it in the long run.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to figure out:\n\n* What‚Äôs the best place to buy real Instagram followers that don‚Äôt drop overnight?\n* Can buying Instagram followers actually help with reach or engagement?\n* Which sites sell safe, high-quality Instagram followers that look authentic?\n\nAny recommendations are appreciated!",

I have never seen someone buy followers and later be glad they did it. \n\nIf you want to buy something, put $5/day on your posts for 7 days, and tell Meta to use your profile visits and followers as a model.

      "selftext": "We operate a horseback riding business. Obviously, this requires physical ability and makes people prone to injury as they are getting on/off horses. Over the past few years, we have had families bring elderly relatives - people in their 80s and 90s, some with very frail bones or broken hips. This is extremely dangerous as they cannot easily get on/off the horse. Some of them are so immobile they cannot even walk from their cars to our staging area let alone get on a horse.\n\nToday we had an elderly fall off the horse and smash her head open.\n\nI want to be able to legally refuse service to people in such a condition. Here is the problem, federal law (Age Discrimination Act of 1975) does not permit us to discriminate based on age or disability. So we are in a gray area here.\n\nI do not want elderly people who are physically immobile to use our service and if they show up I want to be able to legally deny them, but I do not want to violate federal discrimination laws (such as Age Discrimination Act of 1975) and get sued. Are there any out clauses in the law that we can use for denying service based on it being say \"a risk to that person's safety\" or something? Of course I don't know if we are subject to federal age discrimination laws as we are a private company and do not receive federal funding.\n\nDoes anyone know a way around this. I'm thinking if we make a 'safety and risk' policy for ALL customers instead of just elderly that would work. Any info would be appreciated.\n\n  \nWe do have liability waivers customers sign but I still do not want people getting injured.",

The course had spaces that blocked bodies of all ages who couldn't complete the course and we had an addendum you had to sign that if you get \"stuck' we would be rescuing you with our privately owned rescue services for $3000 an hour. \n\nWe reduced our course completion failure from 20% to 1% and increased our revenue because despite stopping a good amount of people from buying tickets, the ones who didn't make it through the obstacle course or decided not to go up with their group, they still bought pizza and played coin operated games instead of shutting down the course and blubbering for 45 minutes as our team dragged them back down the mountain. \n\nIf I were you, I'd buy a big draft horse statue and require all participants to climb over it to qualify for the riding experience. Add in that you can make exceptions to this rule if needed and then you can quietly let kids or anyone you need to skip the requirement but not great aunt Agnes. \n\nHere is the most important part though, set up a nice waiting area so Agnes has something to do somewhere. Mount a TV in the tack room, add a few chairs and play Seabiscuit on a loop. Psychologically no one wants Agnes on the horse they just don't want her sitting in a hot car while they have fun. If you give her a chair and a vending machine somewhere they will ditch her there and feel zero pressure to put her on a horse. It doesn't have to be fancy it just has to look like whoever doesn't go riding will have somewhere to be that is shaded and comfortable. \n\nWe started with just a few seats and a shelf of books and eventually built it up to a pay-fridge, microwave and some pinball machines which paid for themselves immediately.",

It's been a good run, but after all these years I'm trying to figure out if now is the right time and what kind of valuation I should realistically expect.\n\nThe site is monetized through advertising, primarily Google AdSense (around 55%), though I've diversified over the years with other ad networks and direct sponsors. All traffic is organic (SEO-driven), and I run a very lean operation.\n\nLast 12 months the business did about $1.3M in revenue with roughly $1.16M in profit (around 90% margins).\n\nHere's where I'm struggling: I've heard wildly different numbers on multiples. Some say sites like this trade at 3x SDE/EBITDA (especially from competitors), while others mention 5-6x or even higher for strategic buyers who see specific synergies.\n\nFor those of you who've recently sold similar businesses, what kind of multiple did you actually get? And what should I be realistically targeting here?\n\nAny guidance would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

          "body": "To value a business you look at the past several year's average free cash flow (how much money truly available to spend, so not profit) and then divide that by the relative risk of the business (20% for a super super low risk business, 40%+ for a high risk business). That's basically it, the hard part is determining appropriate free cash flow and risk. You can subtract the expected continued growth rate from risk if you'd expect it to keep growing. \n\nYou say 1.1 in profit, are there any costs not included in that? Does that include your salary (fair market to replace you?). Let's say it's actually $900k in free cash flow this year, but an average of $800k over the last 3 years. So let's say your business grows ~10% every year and can reasonably expect that to continue. \n\nIt's a website, that has inherent risk as it's very low barrier to entry for competitors. How vital are you to the success so far? Losing you would be risky. If I had to guess, id think an investor would determine maybe a 35% risk rating. \n\nTherefore the value in this example is: $800k/(0.35-0.1) = $3.2M. You can play with those numbers as you want, but you'll have to convince an investor why they are different. Hopefully this semi helps you understand how to value your/any business.",

You can set up bank rules to help automate recurring expense transactions which will save you time on any backdated work too. From here you‚Äôll also be able to report on your P&amp;L and cash flow and drill down into the detail behind any numbers.\n\nA2X - this is the app we recommend to pull your Amazon payouts analysis through into Xero in a useful and meaningful way. It will help you to analyse the payouts between revenue and the various fees. You can also go further in your analysis and look by country or product category. If you have TikTok synced to Shopify, you‚Äôd also be able to use A2X to analyse those sales too. Otherwise, there are other apps available you can look at for a direct Xero-TikTok sync.\n\nBriefcase - this is an AI first bookkeeping app that will enable you to capture and process all of your purchase invoices and the detail from them through in to Xero.\n\nHow confident are in you in the accuracy of your current spreadsheet analysis, is it delivering proper accrual based accounting reports for you? It‚Äôs often e-commerce businesses can think they‚Äôre loosing money but will actually just be cash negative - particularly if you‚Äôve got too much money tied up in stock.",

Monthly sales, taxes paid on those sales, marketplace selling fees, the net sales, number of sales, average sale price, refunds, and so much more.\n\nI just sit down for about 2 - 3 hours once per month and bulk fill it out the previous month.

I was spending days trying to fix and organize them, but they never seemed to balance. So then i would spend hours reconciling them, and they would be missing bank &amp; credit card transactions. They never took into account marketplace fees or transactions, so i would have to hand add them. It was awful. \n\nBut at 90k per month, get a good bookkeeper, cpa, or whateverthey are called.

Mainly focused on web design then started expanding into other services as my clients started requesting (facebook ads, google, funnels, etc.) so I just turned into a full stack agency.\n\nFirst year was hell and really tough but I pushed through and started getting some clients on a recurring basis. Most of them still with me right now.\n\nPricing is different per client some pay 2k/mo while others pay 1.2k or 1.6k depending on the scope.\n\nUp until 5 months ago I was mostly doing everything myself and just recently got some people to help me out.\n\nI have a media buyer who I pay 1.2k/mo for 3 ad accounts he manages for me and a design agency I started paying 1.5k/mo to take over all the creative production and design for me.\n\nMinus other expenses to run the business it brings my profit to around 5k/mo and I feel thays pretty good considering I‚Äôve never seen that money before and I used to make less than 1,600 every month before this business.\n\nSorry about all the details but now to my actual question. I no longer feel the same drive that I used to have when I started my business. \n\nI remember putting in 12+ hours every single day and not being able to sleep because I had so many ideas I wanted to execute. Every day I would wake up excited to get to work. \n\nNow I have to force myself to work. Dealing with clients, messaging, revisions, out of scope requests, etc. is just irritating now. Every time I hear my phone ring with a whatsapp I feel some type of anger and frustration because It‚Äôs going to be some client asking for more things.\n\nAnd I get it sometimes it sucks and you do need to eat shit for a while but I no longer enjoy what I do.\n\nI started the business because I genuinely wanted to help these businesses but now I can‚Äôt find that passion or energy to work again. \n\nSo I‚Äôm wondering if I should eat shit a little longer and see if I can fix things. Maybe focus on systems and what I can do to actually go back to how I felt.\n\nOr if I should listen to this constant dialogue to just close everything down and start something else.\n\nAnd if I‚Äôm just whining too much and being a bitch just tell me straight up. I‚Äôm the type of person that prefers things straight up hahah so won‚Äôt hurt, it‚Äôs encouraged.\n\nIm curious what are any of your thoughts or ideas on what I could do? It would really help. Thank you for reading.\n",

Try to take a break soon, but not a total disconnect - unplug from the day to day \"tyranny of the urgent\" and spend some time mixed between relaxing and thinking about the things that got you excited in the first place. Catch up on YouTube videos etc whatever content in your niche that you watched when you were hungry early on. Reflect on how you've learned and grown, and rediscover what caught your interest in the first place. Come back with a refreshed perspective. \n\n2) no more WhatsApp. Force your clients to use a professional communication method like email, where things can be categorized, tagged, and prioritized instead of being on call without a salary \n\n3) think about whether your current tier of clients are the kind you want to work with long term. In my experience, the lower end of the market is where most of the needy, micromanaging clients are. If you've got the chops on the team to service upmarket clients, consider raising rates to price out some of the low end. You can take fewer clients for more money and less stress.",

What people don't tell you when you start an agency is that you aren't your own boss - you have 10 bosses on many different projects that you aren't all that interested in. Making payroll each month was tough. I had all sorts of health problems that stemmed from working constantly and being under so much stress. When we'd get a good contract for like $100k, the client ended up owning us and wanting most of our time and attention. It was difficult to sub out work to reliable contractors, but doing everything in house didn't scale.\n\nI don't want to discourage you, but it sounds like you are already picking up on what the road ahead looks like.

      "selftext": "Have you ever had to end a collaboration with someone you genuinely liked working with?\n\nRecently, my business partner and I had to make that call with a freelance developer we both appreciated a lot. He wasn‚Äôt lazy or unskilled. At the beginning he was one of the most reliable people on the team. But over time something shifted. Tasks took longer, communication became distant, and it started to feel like he was working just to fill hours instead of driving things forward.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt dramatic or toxic, just that slow fade where motivation disappears. We tried to talk things through, but nothing really changed. In the end, keeping him on didn‚Äôt feel fair to him or to us.\n\nWhat surprised me most was how heavy it felt afterward. I actually liked the guy, and I kept wondering if I could have done more to help him reconnect. The next day, I spoke with another developer who has been working with us for a while, consistent, reliable, never any drama. I took a moment to thank her for her work, and she seemed genuinely touched.\n\nIt made me realize how often we forget to appreciate the people who quietly do things right until something goes wrong somewhere else.\n\nHave you been through something similar in your business? How did you handle it on your side?",

          "body": "Sounds like you and your partner might just be poor managers.\n\nIt's not up to a freelance developer to \"drive your company forward\", they're hired for a specific job and the expectation should be clear for them.\n\nIt's your job as a manager to set expectations, targets, deadlines, and negotiate all that up front as part of the contract. \n\nIf the freelancer isn't keep up on their end, meeting those expectations, then you take action accordingly.\n\nInstead you create this weird, nebulous situation where you're expecting a freelancer to care about your company as much as you do. They don't, and won't, and it's crazy to expect otherwise. No one will ever give a shit about your business as much as the owners of the business, and you can't ever expect them to.\n\nSounds like you let a good relationship end because you couldn't set proper terms.\n\nedit: also generally speaking, sometimes employees are overambitious early on, think of it as the \"honeymoon stage\", they might feel like they have something to prove, or be all starry-eyed, and reality is that it can just fade over time, especially if their expectations are not in line with reality, if they had high hopes for things, and eventually realize that reality is not as glamorous or exciting as they imagined. We all like to gas ourselves up like we're great employers, but sometimes employees also feel undercompensated (and sometimes are actually undercompensated relative to the market) and that's something else that can disillusion them. So it's completely normal to see an employee who was once a star, eventually fade into \"just average\" over time. It sucks but it's normal.",

Or how much you are a squad leader after playing CoD?\n\nTake for example [software.inc](http://software.inc) \\- pretty realistic in aspects and perspective, but cuts down the micro- and macro- management you'll need to do during all steps.\n\nAccounting is heavy in most business. It's actually the biggest pain point of any business. In the game it's literally few clicks and \"work on loan application\" &lt;- that loan application is a effing pita which might turn into several years if your books are crap.\n\nYou will have issues with inventory which any game won't show, for example it is easier to hold to old electronics I have instead of selling them off or throwing them out because they expired and if company throws them out then it is extra payment, if you sell it - it will take much more time to post it up and negotiate than you'll make back. Selling to liquidator is easier but you need bulk amount to make it viable financially. So you are stuck with old hardware for plenty of time. In the game you just upgrade it for the price of the new system which is not true in reality.\n\nI'm not even talking about HR or other things like working longer means better results - this is all false.\n\nThe very vital inventory is messed up by default in all games, you don't need to figure out location for everything based on size, material, usage rate etc.\n\nThen don't forget financials are always messed up in games - you have regulations, requirements etc.\n\nI like business games because they are very relaxing for me and easy, because everything is intuitive and straightforward.\n\nIRL you will be fumbled by how many layers there are to very simple things you'd never even think of.\n\nThat is why it is important to start trying business early in your lifetime - first and foremost is ability to zone-out into another charismatic person and talk to people, you'll get tired but you'll be selling to people. Thankfully mine is online only but if it happens offline I'm trying to be the most cheerful person out there (i have resting bitch-face by default though).",

You have one time expensive things (POS system, maybe), you have fixed recurring costs (like rent), you have cost of goods sold (what it costs to buy your inventory), and THEN you have some costs that actually depending on whether you are open that day, mostly wages.

What I have learned after being in business for close  to 35 years is that there is a segment of the population that operates from a position of how they can get one over on the business....they go into the transaction with that in mind....they are looking for a discount, a freebie, an argument to justify refusing to pay, etc. They set this up to hold you essentially hostage. You should always be in the position of control and authority. \n\nCan I ask what type of work (or product, item) you do? When customers start that type of behavior I refuse to give them their item/work until it is paid in full. I also require all of them to pay a 50% deposit upfront. I have had to contact the police to remove irate customers, I have thrown customers out of the shop that are out of line, and I have played hard ball when necessary (suggesting involving the court). Their inability to conduct themselves properly, read documents thoroughly, ask questions and so on is not our problem but, in theory, becomes our problem. If it starts difficult, it will end difficult. I want to earn money but I will refuse to chase down or deal with the difficult customers as it never ends well. A mentor always told me \"not all money is good money.\" Even if you perform to standard and deliver, it still ends with them bad mouthing your business. \n\nYou need to learn to stand your ground. Be a professional but be firm. Are you rushing to correct this order and doing it for free? Did they bully you into that....I want it fixed and I want it tomorrow? Did you charge them for the rush job and the additional requests?",

Three people, six states which means six payroll registrations, six different tax portals and about a hundred logins that all somehow expire every month. The first time I tried to onboard someone in another state i spent the entire day just figuring out if I needed a workers comp policy or not. The website crashed twice, customer support told me to check the FAQ and by 5 pm I had a spreadsheet full of red flagged deadlines I didnt even know existed. My breaking point was when one state mailed me a letter saying we were out of compliance because of a missing quarterly filing I never heard of. I started researching, googling alternatives and ended up finding central payroll, a platform that combines payroll, HR, and compliance into one place. Their tagline literally says they handle all the bullshit for startups. I realized the burnout wasnt just about forms or deadlines it was the mental space it took. Every time I wanted to brainstorm or build something I would get pulled back into admin chaos. Its crazy how the thing you love creating can start to feel buried under all the stuff you never signed up for.  \nDo other teams hit that point where the freedom of remote work started to feel like red tape? How do you handle payroll or compliance without losing your mind? Do you keep it in house, outsource, or just hope nothing goes wrong?",
