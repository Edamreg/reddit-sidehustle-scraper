      "selftext": "Ever make money purely by accident? That’s exactly how my first sale from a random keyword went down.\n\nI remember just aimlessly scrolling Etsy one evening, and bam, 'AI journal' started subtly appearing more often. It was totally off-script. On a whim, I fired up Canva, hastily designed a basic digital template, put 'AI prompts' on the cover, hit publish, and logged off. I didn't give it another thought.\n\nWoke up the next morning and “cha-ching”, a sale. I couldn't believe it.\n\nThat minuscule sale was a profound wake-up call. It felt infinitely more satisfying than any elaborate scheme I'd meticulously crafted. No advertising, no aggressive marketing, no sophisticated funnel. Just perfect timing. I'd inadvertently caught a nascent trend before it swelled.\n\nAnd then, a few weeks later, it happened again. This time the keyword was 'coquette bow.' I'll be honest, I didn't even personally like that whole aesthetic, but people were absolutely losing their minds over it. So I just whipped up a few pastel prints, chucked them online, and literally forgot they existed. And boom, they sold too.\n\nAnd that, my friends, was the big 'aha!' moment. I'd spent months (probably years, honestly) torturing myself trying to be 'original,' constantly chasing ideas that literally no one was even asking for. But the money? It only showed up when I finally stopped guessing and just started actually paying attention to what people were already searching for.\n\nThese days, my time is way better spent just observing, seeing what people are saving, what they're searching for, what they're chatting about, rather than trying to brainstorm some brilliant new thing from scratch. And honestly? It's wildly freeing.\n\nSo yeah, that tiny 'AI journal' sale taught me the biggest lesson of all: the internet doesn't give a damn about who's the smartest or most 'original.' It pays the person who just shows up first, period.\n\nEver have a 'dumb' idea that made money, while your 'genius' projects flopped?",

I wanted to have a legit photography session done for them, but it was too expensive for this particular style of photography. \n\nAfter searching online with no luck, I decided I could edit the photo to look like that myself. Once it was done, it looked exactly like I had it professionally taken in a studio and it only took me about 15 mins. Once I understood the process it took just a few minutes to do an edit. \n\nI made a listing on Etsy for that type of photo editing for $25 per photo. I didn’t think anything else about it. Until I got a sale. Then I started getting sales all the time. Sometimes 5 or 6 per day, especially near holidays. \n\nA giant Etsy store jacked my idea and once they were promoting it, there was no more business for my little shop. But it was a super random but successful side hustle for about a year.",

Around where I live in Liverpool daily if walk down different streets close to my house and virtually every single house or flat has been given their own wheelie bins and not just one each they've usually got 3 each or sometimes 2 each! \nOne for general waste, one for recycling and the other for gardening waste! \nAnd I noticed quite often I'd walk past certain wheelie bins and there would be a terrible smell coming from them! Even when they where empty and had the lids closed! \nAnd I know that's probably through no fault of their own, because obviously stuff get out inside the bins that is is going to have a bad smell sometimes. It's only normal!! \n\nBut then I thought to myself.........I've never actually seen anybody at all in my local area specifically! Cleaning out their wheelie bins! \n\nI mean, have you ever seen anyone cleaning their wheelie bins? \nIt's not the nicest job, it's dirty and it stinks and nobody wants to do it do they, but!!! If I asked around the houses in the streets in my local area first. In a small radius of my own house and/or advertised wheelie bin cleaning to your door! Possibly starting at £4 per bin?! I don't know?! \nTo start off with I personally think all id need to clean people's wheelie bins is a bucket, I a large sponge or a few, a large scourer or scrubbing implement (or possibly a few) \nSome overalls (or Personal protective equipment) \n\nSome latex gloves or even some marigolds would suffice!  And maybe sometimes I might require a face mask. And some cleaning agent or other dependant on what the local council's guidelines are on stuff like that, if your allowed to use bleach or not I don't know it would have to be researched!!\n\nAnd I thought initially you could go house to house and if they agree to have a wheelie bin or two or three cleaned by myself all I would need to do is ask them to put some hot water in my empty bucket (like the window cleaners do at every single house) \n\nAnd get the wheelie bin flat on the floor and get on my hands and knees and get it cleaned with a bit of elbow grease! \nI'm not scared of a bit of hard work and some horrible smells sometimes haha! \n\nSo if they agreed to have one bin cleaned that would be £4 per house\n2 bins is £8 per house \n3 bins is £12 per house, \nThen you work out how many houses would actually agree to have their wheelie bins cleaned, because it's not a job anyone really wants to do. And like I said in the beginning.....I've never actually ever seen anyone ever cleaning their wheelie bins! \n\nI've had a quick look into it in my area of Liverpool and there's not any regular wheelie bin cleaners and it would hopefully be a very low start up cost when starting out if all I used was a bucket I carried around containing my sponges or scourers or scrubbing brushes plus the correct cleaning agents that is permitted by my local council. \nAnd my gloves and overalls. (Personal protective equipment):\n\nAnd that's it! \n\nObviously if it took off and a lot of locals did want their bins cleaning I could then possibly increase the prices per bins to maybe £5 per bin, £6 per bin, I don't know, and you could possibly have a few extras that could have an extra cost maybe £1/£2 per bin for a spray of an air freshener that maybe includes an antibacterial property when their bin has finished being cleaned? \nI dunno just a thought!\n\nYou could also maybe sell numbers or stickers that can be bought for an extra cost for each bin with their house number stuck on the sides or something like that? \n\n\nWhat do people think about this for an idea of a start up business? \n\nObviously when and if I can hopefully start earning an income I can then buy the business a pressure washer or a trolley with a handle I can wheel round with me with my equipment on it. \n\nBut I really do think it could take off. Especially where I live. Due to the fact that I said many houses wheelie bins smell bad and are really dirty as expected, but I've never seen anyone cleaning them! \n\nAnd then this could be a regular service, maybe once a month or fortnightly or even weekly if the customer wanted! \n\nI think I'm going to do as much research into the idea as I can during the winter months and get as much information from the local council and try getting things set up for myself and get some advertising and marketing made up so I'm ready to launch this little business when the weather starts to warm up. \n\nGet some promotions figured out and set up. \n\nI'm really looking forward to it, and if all else fails......I won't of spent a lot of money and lost it. \n\n\nCan anyone give me any thoughts on what they think personally please? Id really appreciate it! Thanks",

I’d recommend not going for copywriting, dropshipping, reselling etc… every top g with an online university is teaching that shit and it’s such an overcrowded space where only a select few actually get good cash. My recommendations would bet to go for an actually desired skill that you can scale and start freelancing. For example: digital art (if u’re good at drawing or are willing to learn), 3d designing in blender, video editing, thumbnail designing, logo designing, album cover art designing, website development, and there’s just so much more this is just to name a few.\n\nSeriously, don’t go for copywriting or dropshipping. It’s not only that it’s hard it’s just so oversaturated and luck based. If you actually become good at one of the skills I listed you will have 0 problems in getting paid as long as your work is good. It’s not easy, it’s not a “get rich quick” scheme, but if you are actually trying to build something without depending on luck it’s the best option. Also you would be really surprised on how good you can get in a couple of months with focused effort. Im well off working full time as a video editor now and I still wish I started earlier myself.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI want to share something practical that actually worked for me. I’m not a tech person, not a full-time creator, but I found a simple system that started bringing in around $50/day after 3 months — and it’s surprisingly doable if you stick with it.\n\nStep 1: Start small &amp; solve a real problem\n\nInstead of chasing trends, I looked at what I was struggling with — too many side-hustle ideas, no clear plan.\n\nSo I built a tiny digital guide + checklist (think: what to do in week 1, 2, 3). That’s it.\n\nIt wasn’t fancy, but it solved one pain point: “Where do I start?”\n\nAnd people paid for that clarity.\n\nStep 2: Make your content look professional (without hiring anyone)\n\nThis was the key: I realized presentation matters. People buy what looks valuable.\n\nBut I didn’t want to spend hundreds on filming or models.\n\nSo I experimented with a few tools that let you create realistic human visuals. I used them to make lifestyle-style visuals and short explainer clips for my digital product.\n\nIt made my brand look way more trustworthy, even though it was just me behind the screen.\n\nStep 3: Focus on one platform &amp; post consistently\n\nI picked TikTok (because organic reach is still good in 2025).\n\nMy content formula was:\n\n· 3 videos per week\n\n· Each one showing a piece of the process (“how I made my first sale”, “what I learned about pricing”, etc.)\n\n· CTA: “Free checklist link in bio”\n\nNo editing team, no paid ads — just showing small progress each week.\n\nStep 4: Monetize through simple upgrades\n\nOnce I got traction, I added two things:\n\n1.A “premium” version of the guide with templates and extra walkthroughs ($19)\n\n2.A small group for Q&amp;A support ($15/month)\n\nTogether, that brought me to \\~$2K/month in 3 months.\n\nNot crazy numbers, but real and consistent.\n\nStep 5: Things that helped me most\n\n· Don’t wait to look perfect. Post even if your setup is basic.\n\n· Pick one product and one platform, don’t scatter your attention.\n\n· Recycle content: one visual → three clips → carousel post → blog.\n\n· Use AI tools to save time, not replace creativity.\n\n· Talk to your early buyers. They’ll tell you what version 2 should be.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe online income space is loud right now, but there’s still room for small, thoughtful creators who actually help people.\n\nYou don’t need to build an agency or code a SaaS. Sometimes it’s just:\n\nidentify a pain point, make something useful, present it well, stay consistent.\n\nHope this breakdown helps anyone thinking about starting something small.\n\nEdit: A few people asked about the visuals I mentioned. I used a tool called APOB for most of the promo content.\n\nYou can create a custom human-like model, pick poses or actions, and it automatically turns it into images or short videos. Super helpful if you want realistic faces or “brand spokesperson” style clips without filming yourself.",

I could confidently teach the basics, the major/minor scales, minor pentatonic stuff, blues, circle of fifths, modes.  But I'm still learning myself, slower now that I'm an adult but the advanced harmony and playing jazz are more of my practice and not something I could teach.",

No, they are not more than a couple of bucks here and there.\n\nHowever, I'm with the mindset that 1$ I get passively is one dollar I don't need to work for, which is a win in my book. For example, cashback programs are a must. I use Trading212 because it's the best one easily avaliable to me (hmu if you want an link) but there are others out there. I use \"invest cashback\" option which would in theory generate more passive income over time, too. High yield savings for any money you will need soon but you don't need at the moment. I also have a post on my profile for Microsoft Rewords. Another one is renting formal clothing, I rent a dress through a local service. People get it for special events and then return it.\n\nDon't expect wonders from low effort no investmant incomes. However, they do stack up and are petter than nothing.",

      "selftext": "I’ve put years into side hustles, and I’ve come to realize they’re not as profitable as I once hoped. Over the years, I’ve come across so many “get rich quick” schemes, and I can confidently say about 50% of them are scams. The crazy part is that the people buying into these schemes don’t always realize they’re the ones being sold. The sellers often pretend to be buyers, making it seem like a legitimate opportunity. But really, the whole thing is just one big scam where the buyers are sold the idea that they’re going to make money while the scam itself just keeps going.\n\nWhat’s worse is that the legit side jobs I once relied on are starting to disappear. Freelancing gigs that used to make sense are now being taken over by AI. More and more tasks are being automated, and it’s only going to get harder for those of us trying to make a little extra money.\n\nI’ve found ways to keep some things manageable by using AI tools to streamline my work. Genstore is one of the tools that’s really helped me. I was able to get my store up and running quickly, leaving me more time to focus on what really matters like interacting with customers and getting their feedback.\n\nIf your side hustle feels overwhelming, this is where AI and humans really work well together. It’s about working smarter, not harder. AI has its limitations, but tools like these help you focus on the important stuff while saving you time and energy.\n\nBuilding a business is tough, but it also creates opportunities to find creative solutions that others might not have thought of. Finding ways to make your process easier can give you a serious edge. If you haven’t made the shift yet, now’s the time.\n\nLet’s keep the conversation going. If you’ve tried something similar or are thinking about it, I’d love to hear about it. Adapting is key right now, and it’s one of the most valuable skills we can have.",

      "selftext": "What 40 Days of Writing Taught Me\n\nwell.... we are starting off on the wrong foot. It is actually only 39 days but I didn't wanna wait another day to write this out as it's fresh in my mind. SO here we are on day 39 of writing everyday. 40 just sounds better in the header. It made you click didn't it? \n\nI’ve written every single night for 39 days straight.\n\nAfter work. After my kids went to sleep.\n\nJust me, my laptop, and my thoughts.\n\nHere’s what I’ve learned; the stuff that actually matters 👇\n\n  \n1. Don't wait to start. Start today and figure out what you wanna write about after writing a few. I still don't know what i wanna write everyday I am just writing. \n\n2. 66 days builds a habit - I see why this is true.. I'm almost at day 66 and I don't plan on stopping\n\n3. I write at night so it has been added to my routine. Which is nice because i never know what i'm writing about each night. \n\n4. No need to moitvate myself. Now i ust pay a game with streaks. Consisetency is now my motivations. \n\n5. I have had 5 or more days with no new subscibers. But i kept going and never stopped. \n\n6. I only focused on writing. Now the rule is simple. I can write anywhere else so tonight i'm doing this reddit post. But I have to write. No building a saas, new product etc. No more shiney obects just focus. \n\n7. Fail fast. I wrote about 7.... different topics the first 10 days. I learned quickly that i shouldn't focus on one thing. I stopped wasting time updating my landing page. Now i keep it very generic. \n\n8.  One idea = 10 posts (I wrote about it in an issue. bascially i'm taking 1 newsletter issue and publishing it on X, Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, Youtube, Medium, and a few others. \n\n9. Don't sell. The issue I wrote that said I wrote a book(even though it was a free one) didn't get open nearly as much as my average. Only 15% opened that email because they most likely thought i was selling them something. \n\n10.  Automate the boring parts, not the marketing parts.\n\n11. You won't  figure out what you wanna do unless you do a bunch of things. \n\n12.  Test your audience with content just like a comedian does. Track who visits your site and see what social channel brings in the most refferals then triple down on that one \n\n13. If you wanna write about the latest trending topic. Make sure to have it flow into your day to day writing not just talk about it only. Tell a story behind it. \n\n14.  My kids don't care about followers, they just wanna hang with daddy. Make time for those you care about.  Great businesses don't make you work 24/7. They let you sleep and enjoy life. \n\n15. Help others instead of being helped. It's alot more reasonable for people to see you are making an effort then asking for it. Message that famous person, give them suggestions without pluging your stuff. \n\n  \nHope this helps. Yea there is formatting errors and spelling errors but I'm not going back to proof read it. ",

      "selftext": "As a freelance designer who tried side hustle on fiverr and working in a design company, I’ve been, or the designers around me all have been feeling the squeeze lately. Recently we have been discussing nano banana 2, which will supposedly be dropped in a few days. The industry vibe shifted for me in an instant, and I believe it is the same for all the other designers. I wasn’t just worrying about tools getting smarter; I worried about my own voice getting buried in the noise.\n\nIt isn't a futuristic breakthrough, but rather an adjustment in my mindset. I recognized the tools at my disposal (particularly those designed to simplify the design process) and embraced them productively. I now understand that dealing with change does not need to be a mental hurdle; rather, I can use it to sharpen my ideas and move rapidly. Tools that simplify processes have been developed to assist designers in the transition from ideas to execution.\n\nIn order to improve my workflow, I have tried a variety of methods. To begin, I wanted to try tools that were inexpensive and friendly to freelancers. These tools, while not a substitute for everything, do help me narrow down my ideas, organize my workflow, and improve my end product in a time-efficient manner. I work in the following steps: 1. Identify as precisely as possible the core problem, audience, stylistic cues, and the main creative points. 2. Allow the AI to provide a few options for directions to get a broader idea. 3. Use my own design sensibilities to filter, adjust, and tailor the outcome to tell the client’s story.\n\nMy takeaway: calm down; do not resist; try the changes. Use AI to improve our ideas and strengthen what we already have.",

From freelancing and crypto (RIP my portfolio full of meme coins) to affiliate marketing and digital products, I’ve wasted time money and energy on more dead end strategies than I can count. Although I made good money via affiliate marketing and digital products.\n\nBut here’s the surprising truth **The most boring business model ended up being the most reliable.**  \n\n### **The Winner? [Niche Job Boards](https://sitefy.co/product/remote-job-platform-saas-for-sale/)**  \n- **Revenue Streams** Job postings ($100–$500 each) AdSense ($500–$5k/month) sponsorships and premium memberships.  \n- **Effort Required** Heavy upfront work (6–12 months) then ~80% passive.  \n- **Avg Monthly Profit After Scaling** $3k–$20k across multiple boards.  \n\nI know *yawn*. But unlike crypto pumps or sketchy affiliate schemes job boards solve a real problem (employers need hires job seekers want opportunities) and scale predictably.  \n\n### **Why Most Passive Income Ideas Fail**  \n- **Freelancing** Active income disguised as passive.  \n- **Crypto/Stocks** More gambling than a business.  \n- **Print on Demand/Dropshipping** Saturated and reliant on constant marketing.  \n- **Affiliate Marketing** Requires relentless content creation or paid traffic.  \n\nJob boards aren’t sexy but they’re **recession resistant automate friendly and compound over time**. My biggest board now runs on 2–3 hours of maintenance per week.  \n\n### **Want to Try It Heres the Hard Truth**  \n- **Pick a Niche You Understand** (e.g. \"Remote DevOps Jobs\" beats \"General Tech Jobs\").  \n- **Expect 6–12 Months of Grind** before meaningful income.  \n- **Monetization Levers** Job listings (highest $) ads paid newsletters recruiter partnerships.  \n\n**Question for You** Whats your most reliable passive income stream? (And if its crypto no judgement I’ve been there.) Drop it in the comments!  \n\n*(No course to sell no hidden agenda just sharing what finally worked after a decade of trial and error.)*",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nLately my feed has been full of small founders posting revenue milestones. Stuff like “just hit my first $1k MRR” or “made it to $10k a month.”. \n\nIt’s easy to see why these posts get so much attention. For anyone used to trading hours for money, the idea of building something that earns while you sleep is incredibly appealing. You’re no longer capped by how many hours you can work. Making money while you sleep pretty much sums up what passive income is all about.\n\nI started noticing some patterns in their posts. \n\nHere’s what I kept seeing:\n\n**1. They solve small, specific problems.**  \nThey are heavily niched down. They find a small, annoying issue that a specific group of people has and fix it really well.  \nExample: a developer named Viktor Seraleev built a little collage app called BabyFrame. It helps new parents make cute baby photo collages without a complicated editor. It’s now making over $700 a month. Not flashy, just focused and useful. Source: [https://x.com/seraleev/status/1982460201413358066](https://x.com/seraleev/status/1982460201413358066)\n\n\n\n**2. Recurring revenue is the goal.**  \nAlmost none of them rely on one time sales models. The focus is steady, predictable monthly income. This is perfect for passive income. You build something once and it generates a steady recurring monthly income.\n\n  \nRob Hallam, for example, hit $10k a month with his SaaS and is aiming for $100k. That kind of recurring revenue is insane. source: [https://x.com/robj3d3/status/1982390087284318350](https://x.com/robj3d3/status/1982390087284318350)  \n\n\n**3. They move fast.**  \nThe best indie builders don’t spend years polishing an idea. They launch early to see if anyone cares.  \nOne guy named [Alex ](https://x.com/qwertyu_alex)went from writing his first line of code to making his first dollar in five days. That’s possible now because of all the tools out there. Things like Supabase for the backend combined with AI coding assistants make it now possible.\n\n\n\n**4. They build in public.**  \nThey don’t build in silence. They share their progress, numbers, struggles, and lessons as they go.  \nWhen [Rob Hallam](https://x.com/robj3d3) shared that he hit $10k a month, he also documented how he got there. [Matt Welter](https://x.com/mattwelter), who built ReelFarm and hit $35k MRR, publicly thanked his users for helping shape the product. Being open builds trust and community, and it works as marketing too.\n\n\n\n**Key learnings:**\n\n* Find a small, painful problem for a niche audience.\n* Focus on recurring revenue.\n* Launch fast and improve as you go.\n* Build in public.\n\n  \nHope this inspires you on your passive income journey! \n\n",

And most legit remote/work from home jobs do prefer either skilled workers or people who already live in the same country due to tax, payroll, and regulation issues. WFH has been harder nowadays, lots of people returning to the office, and if an opportunity does come up, there are thousands of applicants.\n\nI don’t know what country you’re in, and that matters a lot, because job opportunities vary heavily by region. For example, where I live there are call centers that are constantly hiring. They usually have a very high turnover rate, so they’re almost always looking for people. Some of them even let you work remotely after a short training period and they usually don’t require special skills beyond communication and some basic computer knowledge.",

Basically, it means that if you apply for a Capital One card with a 680 credit score, you're stuck there permanently. It doesn't matter if your credit score is now 820 like mine is (basically perfect, 1% utilization with $90k max credit.)

It’s designed for both home and industrial setups — super quiet, efficient, and easy to run.\n\nIt claims to pull up to $6k/month mining Litecoin (depending on network difficulty), and my early returns are lining up decently so far.\nSetup took less than 10 minutes — plug in, Wi-Fi connect, input wallet, start earning.\n\nIt’s not exactly “set and forget,” but it’s surprisingly hands-off.\nAnyone else diversifying into physical tech-based income streams?",

It wasn’t a fortune, but it added up to about $100 in a month, and the sales kept coming even when I wasn’t touching anything.\n\nPhotography used to dominate these platforms, but AI has taken over that space. Right now, the real opportunity is in areas AI still struggles with clean, editable vector designs and motion graphics with transparent backgrounds. Those take real structure and creativity.\n\nIf you’re new to this, here’s the foundation that actually matters:\n\n* Learn how to make proper vector files (icons, shapes, or simple illustrations).\n* Learn basic motion graphics  how to move layers and export clean animations.\n* Study what’s trending in marketplaces before you upload.\n* Be consistent; upload small batches regularly instead of random drops.\n\nI put everything I learned into a short PDF guide that explains the workflow and lessons in detail.  \nIf you’re interested or want to know how it all works, just DM me.",

Before I explain the strategy, I am not selling a membership nor am I asking for any personal information. This strategy is called reverse split arbitration. Basically, whenever a stock reverse splits, there is a chance that it rounds up. The round up is where we make the profit.

But I figured I’d link it to a few stores I already use and just forget about it.\n\nNow it’s sort of running quietly in the background. I’ll buy something online, the little notification pops up, and a few weeks later I notice a few dollars added back. It’s not a big deal each time, but it adds up over time in this subtle way.\n\nWhat surprised me more than the money is how it’s changed my mindset around spending. I don’t chase deals or buy things just because there’s cashback. If anything, I’ve started pausing before clicking “checkout.” Every purchase now has a small moment of reflection like, do I actually need this, or am I just reacting to a sale?\n\nIt’s definitely not a get-rich thing, but that small pause has become the real reward. The cashback itself is nice, but the awareness it built feels even more valuable. Kind of funny how a small experiment in saving ended up turning into a quiet spending habit reset.",

There are 2 machines one is a candy and snack, the other is a pop. I went and saw the machines yesterday and they do appear to be older machines, but can be upgraded to a credit card reader. He mentioned he doesn't stop in very often maybe once a month but when he stopped in last, the candy machine made $50, but much of the big sellers were sold out so he thinks he could make much more if he went more often and added in different items. The pop machine made about $80, and same thing the big sellers were sold out. He's asking $2,500 for the machines and the location it comes with. The profits seem a bit low for the price I was given, and would take me a pretty long time to make back my initial investment. There's no commission to the owners and being able to upgrade the machines to card readers could increase sales by a good margin. Wanted to get a few other opinions on this, and if this would be a good or bad move. ",

At this point it’s 100% passive — no inventory, no manual approval, no support tickets. Just the occasional “Wait, someone *really* bought April 20th??” moment.\n\nI’m mostly sharing this here because I’d love to know how to make it more visible *without turning into one of those spammy side hustles*.  \nIf you’re curious to take a look, here’s the site: [ownthedate.com](https://www.ownthedate.com)\n\nAnd since I know Reddit hates marketing: here’s a **50% off code** — `REDDIT50`.  \nUse it or ignore it, no hard feelings. 😅\n\nWould love your thoughts — whether it’s about the concept, the tech stack, or how to scale something like this ethically.",

      "selftext": "Hey r/JustStart! Two weeks ago I shared my interactive plant milk quiz site built with Claude AI. Here's the 14-day update.\n\n**Quick Recap:**\n\n* Niche: Plant-based milk alternatives (oat, almond, soy, etc.)\n* Site: Interactive quiz → matches users with plant milk → Amazon affiliate links\n* Built with zero coding experience using Claude AI\n* Started Oct 9, now Day 20\n\n\n\n**What's Changed (Day 6 → Day 20):**\n\n**Content Strategy Shift:**\n\n* Pivoted HARD to SEO content\n* Published 8 blog posts in 14 days (2x/week cadence)\n* Topics: \"Best Plant Milk for Coffee,\" \"Protein,\" \"Weight Loss,\" \"Kids,\" \"Smoothies,\" \"Keto,\" \"Oat vs Almond,\" \"Is Soy Milk Healthy\"\n* All 2,000-2,500 words with proper Schema markup, internal linking, affiliate links\n* Added \"Latest from Blog\" section to homepage\n\n**Traffic Evolution:**\n\n* Week 1 (Reddit spike): 240 users\n* Week 2-3 (post-Reddit crash): \\~5-10 users/day (mostly direct)\n* Reddit experiment today: Posted golden milk recipe to r/veganrecipes (294 views, low engagement - learned I need photos for recipe posts)\n\n**Monetization:**\n\n* **$6.36 total earnings** (up from $1.69 two weeks ago! 🎉)\n* **8 items shipped** (up from 1)\n* **102 Amazon clicks** (up from 30 in first week)\n* **7.84% conversion rate** (clicks → orders shipped)\n* Funny reality: People bought a winter jacket, 5x ultrasonic mouse repellents, a car phone mount... but ZERO actual plant milk 😂\n* Amazon's 24-hour cookie captures anything they buy, not just what you link to\n\n**Tech Updates:**\n\n* Added blog index page with green \"NEW\" badge system for latest post\n* Internal linking between all 8 posts\n* Updated sitemap after each post\n* Cookie consent + Google Analytics properly configured\n* All posts have affiliate disclosure boxes\n* Added homepage blog preview section (shows latest 3 posts)\n\n**Reddit Experiments:**\n\n* Tried helpful comment in r/vegan niche question thread (genuine engagement)\n* Posted golden milk recipe to r/veganrecipes today (learned: NEED PHOTOS for recipe posts)\n* Being careful not to spam or over-promote\n* Focusing on being helpful first, promotional never\n\n\n\n**Current Stats (Day 20):**\n\n**Content:**\n\n* 8 blog posts live (2,000+ words each)\n* Strong internal linking structure\n* All with Schema markup + affiliate disclosures\n\n**Traffic:**\n\n* \\~400 total users (lifetime)\n* \\~5-10 users/day (organic baseline post-Reddit)\n* Still waiting on first Google impression (sitemap submitted 7 days ago)\n\n**Monetization:**\n\n* $6.36 earned\n* 102 Amazon clicks\n* 8 items shipped\n* 7.84% conversion rate (solid for affiliate!)\n\n**Investment:**\n\n* Time: \\~27 hours total (12 hours week 1, \\~15 hours weeks 2-3)\n* Money: Claude Pro $250/year + domain $12/year = $262 total\n* ROI so far: -$255.64 😅\n\n\n\n**What I've Learned:**\n\n**Content Production with AI:**\n\n* Claude AI is INSANE for content creation when you give it structure\n* My workflow: I write outlines, Claude writes full posts, I edit/approve\n* Can produce a 2,500-word blog post in \\~90 minutes\n* Quality is solid (readable, well-structured, properly cited with Amazon affiliate links)\n* Internal linking happens naturally when you prompt for it\n\n**SEO Reality Check:**\n\n* Google takes FOREVER (submitted sitemap 7 days ago, zero impressions yet)\n* Reddit traffic is a drug - spike feels great, crash hurts\n* Building content library while waiting for indexing\n* Playing the long game now (this is month 1 of a 12+ month play)\n\n**What Actually Matters:**\n\n* Quality internal linking (connects all 8 posts)\n* Consistent publishing schedule (2x/week is sustainable for me with full-time job + family)\n* Actually helpful content (not keyword-stuffed garbage)\n* Patience (everyone says 6-12 months to see real results)\n\n**The Weird Amazon Thing:**\n\n* People click plant milk links but buy random stuff\n* That 24-hour cookie is powerful - captures ANY purchase\n* 7.84% conversion is actually solid for affiliates\n* But you need TRAFFIC to make it work\n\n\n\n**Mistakes I Made:**\n\n1. **Relied too much on Reddit early** \\- not sustainable, just a vanity spike\n2. **Posted recipe without photo** \\- Reddit loves visuals, learned that today\n3. **Expected faster Google indexing** \\- reality = 2-4 weeks minimum\n4. **Didn't build email list** \\- should've started Day 1 (still haven't)\n5. **No returning visitor strategy** \\- everyone takes quiz once and bounces forever\n6. **Obsessed over analytics too much** \\- should focus on content instead\n\n\n\n**Next 14 Days (Day 20-34):**\n\n**Content:**\n\n* Publish 2-3 more posts (\"Best Plant Milk for Baking,\" \"Is Oat Milk Healthy,\" \"Cashew vs Almond\")\n* Target: 10-12 total posts by Day 34\n* Keep internal linking strong between all posts\n\n**SEO:**\n\n* Wait for Google indexing (should happen soon... right?)\n* Monitor Search Console obsessively for first impression\n* Optimize based on what ranks (if anything)\n\n**Traffic:**\n\n* Stop chasing Reddit spikes (not sustainable)\n* Focus on building organic foundation\n* Maybe experiment with Pinterest (visual platform, recipe-friendly)\n* Consider other subreddits for genuine engagement\n\n**Monetization:**\n\n* Add more affiliate opportunities in existing posts (protein powders, kitchen tools, etc.)\n* Consider email capture for newsletter (finally)\n* Track which posts drive clicks (protein? smoothies? coffee?)\n\n\n\n**Questions for the Community:**\n\n1. **How long did YOUR first Google impression take?** (I'm at 7 days post-sitemap submission, getting anxious)\n2. **Is 8 posts enough to start seeing traction?** Or should I hit 20-30 first?\n3. **Anyone else using Claude/AI for content?** What's your workflow? Quality concerns?\n4. **Tips for reducing bounce rate on quiz sites?** Everyone takes quiz once and leaves forever - how do I get them back?\n5. **That 7.84% conversion rate - is that actually good?** Or am I celebrating too early?\n\n\n\n**The Reality Check:**\n\nI'm in the \"valley of death\" right now:\n\n* Reddit spike is gone ✅\n* Google hasn't kicked in yet ❌\n* Traffic is \\~5-10/day 📉\n* Grinding out content hoping it pays off in 3-6 months ⏳\n* $6.36 earned vs $262 invested = -$255.64 in the hole 💸\n\nBut honestly? I'm learning a ton, the content quality is solid, and I'm building something that *should* work once Google starts sending traffic. The hard part is the waiting and not knowing if you're wasting your time.\n\nThe AI workflow is genuinely game-changing though - there's no way I could produce 8 quality blog posts in 2 weeks without Claude. That alone might be the most valuable thing I've learned.\n\n**Site:** [**noncow.com**](http://noncow.com) (8 blog posts live if you want to check quality)\n\nHappy to answer questions about the AI workflow, content strategy, Amazon weirdness, or the emotional rollercoaster of month 1! 😅",

      "selftext": "A few months ago, I decided to take my side hustle more seriously. I’d been juggling my 5–6 job and my passion for building online stores, but I always told myself I needed more time, more knowledge, or the perfect idea before I could really start.\n\nEventually, I realized that “waiting to be ready” was just another way of procrastinating so I took action. I picked a niche, built my first store, and committed to learning through doing.\n\nIt wasn’t smooth at all.  \nI tested multiple products, redesigned the store more times than I can count, and even faced a few failed ads. But with each setback, I learned something new  from how to identify better products to how customer experience impacts conversion more than flashy design ever could.\n\nThe real turning point came when I started collaborating with a few people who were more experienced than I was. Instead of trying to do everything alone, I learned to build around teamwork, consistent testing, and small daily improvements. That’s when I began seeing consistent sales and growth not overnight success, but steady, measurable progress.\n\nWhat I’ve learned so far:\n\n* Execution beats endless planning.\n* Collaboration can speed up your learning curve dramatically.\n* Every failure hides a lesson  sometimes, that lesson is worth more than the win itself.\n\nI’m still learning every day, but looking back, I’m glad I stopped overthinking and just started.\n\nHas anyone else here experienced that shift  when you moved from planning to actually doing? I’d love to hear how it changed your results.",

      "selftext": "My barber does a great job cutting hair, but like most barbershops, the prices are a bit steep these days ($30+, plus tip).\n\nPersonally, my hair grows very fast, so if I wanted to keep it clean, I would easily have to get my haircut at least once every two weeks or so. It also doesn't help that I don't have the greatest neckline (i.e. it looks messy once my hair starts to grow out). However, paying that much money just wasn't something I was willing to do so I would wait longer than I wanted to between cuts.\n\nMy barber mentioned to me that business wasn't doing well. This wasn't a surprise to me because his shop was rarely busy.\n\nI have no barbershop experience but I do enjoy thinking of ways to make businesses more efficient and profitable.\n\nI suggested that he try this: offer basic (not bad) haircuts that he could do quickly &amp; efficiently, for a lower price. This would mean no skin fades and no use of scissors (I know this might sound crazy but a previous barber of mine only used clippers and it worked completely fine for my shorter hairstyle. He had longer clipper attachment guards so this isn't a matter of everyone getting a short buzzcut) because that also rules out longer hairstyles, etc.\n\nThere is a market out there for people like myself who are wanting basic haircuts and would get haircuts more frequently if the price was lower.\n\nHe took my advice and he has never been busier. There is almost always someone waiting in line for a haircut, and he has even implemented a numbering system. He charges $22 with no tip option. Although the price is lower, his chair almost always has someone in it and he gets through his haircuts much faster.\n\nSomething I want to stress again is that these are not bad haircuts. These are just simple (compared to some other haircuts out there) haircuts. Yes, I know cutting your hair at home is an option but that is irrelevant to this. There are many reason why someone may not want to cut their own hair, and also, some people do skin fades on themselves so a basic haircut does not automatically mean that someone can do it themselves.",

      "selftext": "Quick update to my previous posts about the nightmare client situation.\n\nContext: one client makes up $5k per month which is almost half of my revenue. They've been complete chaos, disorganized records, 2am receipt dumps, constant weekend emergencies. I posted asking if I should fire them and Reddit overwhelmingly said raise rates and set boundaries instead.\n\nI sent an email last week raising their rate from $5k to $7.5k per month and included an actual service framework with 10-day submission deadlines, rush fees for last-minute requests, communication hours Monday through Friday 9am-6pm only, and no more weekend work.\n\nThey went silence for a week. I was legitimately convinced they were ghosting me and started mentally preparing for losing half my income. Yesterday they called me and we had this tense 20 mins talk with lots of questions and pushback, but I honestly couldn't tell where it was heading.\n\nThis morning, I got their email response and I'm honestly conflicted about what to do. Screenshot attached.\n\nThey want to move forward but counter offer $7k per month instead of $7.5k. They're also pushing back on the timeline, saying they want to start with 7 business days deadlines instead of 10 and work up to it over the next quarter. And here's the one that's really bothering me, they accept the Monday-Friday 9-6 communication hours but want to discuss exceptions for quarterly filing periods where some weekend work might be necessary. They did acknowledge that they kinda expected this coming given how they've been operating, and they need 90 days to review how it's working. But I'm genuinely torn here.\n\nPart of me says take the deal because I won the principle, $7k is still a 40% increase, and some of their pushback seems reasonable for a transition period. Part of me says hold firm because I set $7.5k for a reason, that quarterly exception language feels like the exact slippery slope back to weekend chaos, and they're already negotiating boundaries before even accepting them. I'm leaning more towards the take the deal part.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/57jxtujji6yf1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=deb53723b067c6ddadac9b593edf1b46a22dc38f\n\n",

      "selftext": "Background: I run a small international snack brand called Pop Snax, which I started 2 years ago. Initial operations were out of my apartment where snacks took up every inch of space, lol. I've grown steadily over the last year, and I'm now working out of a co-warehouse space.\n\nAnyway, last Sunday, something wild happened. A huge influencer (Joe Bartolozzi) who randomly ordered one of my mystery snack boxes in August, unboxed it on stream. Had no idea who he was so I had no idea he was even placing an order. Within hours, my website traffic exploded. Shopify was dinging nonstop.. I got over 300 orders in two days. I was super confused at first and asked a customer how they found me, and that's when I found out about the influencer unboxing. \n\nI cried almost constantly for the first 2 days bc this was one of those surreal “this is actually happening” moments, and I had no idea what I'd done to deserve this. Since last Sunday, orders have been heavy and consistent and the video featuring my box has hit 850k views!  \n  \nWhile running the business, I also work a full-time job, so, I've been running on fumes trying to keep up with customer emails, packing, and fulfilling, often late into the night. It's been exciting, but also kind of chaotic.\n\nAnyway, this viral moment has given me my first real taste of HEAVY demand at scale, but its also exposed how under-resourced I am as a solopreneur. I don’t have a team yet, or fulfillment support, and I’m still figuring out how to maintain that momentum after the viral wave calms down.\n\nEven with the boost, I know growth won't be linear. There’s still the day-to-day grind I'm trying to figure out, i.e. running ads, improving packaging, managing costs, dealing with platform issues (looking at you, Amazon 😅), and trying to make every customer happy. I'm trying to get deep into AI, so I can offload some of that pressure/manual oversight. \n\nFeel free to ask me anything! And if anyone else here has gone viral with a product or business, how did you handle the surge? Did you manage to sustain it afterward?",

My site crashed immediately. I got it shored up with my hosting provider and I got 30 orders that day. I had just started and was previously doing 5-10 orders a week. \n\nWith another, we launched a seasonal product after one month in business that really worked well for our customer base. We got 20 orders in two days. Worse, I had to leave about 2 days later and my wife was left making and packing all these orders. \n\nWhat I think is worth remembering is that these blips don't necessarily sustain. For both businesses we saw an ongoing increase in traffic and orders, but if we had expanded based on those blips we would have lost money. \n\nWe also could have learned to capitalize on the attention better to get a longer term benefit.

Especially short form and reels etc.\n\nThe success of these strategies are heavily dependent on your industry and your model. How you design and implement these strategies too.\n\nThe big mistake I see brands making is to think they should be everywhere all at once. This really stems from not knowing your client and listening to external motivators(like agencies and content creators etc)\n\nI see brands jump on trends or jump on things like founder marketing, podcast etc. without thinking it through and really, and I mean REALly understanding the entire spend involved. We end up wasting a massive amount of time and resources to add to the noise for what we perceive to be marketing.\n\nMy business for instance, i have shut down all social channels do no founder marketing or any of this stuff that gets touted on the channels.\n\nMy website is my single source of truth. I use whatsapp for updates of our work and comms to warm leads and existing and ex clients, friends and family with a simple opt out thumbs down. Not automated. And email, same thing. Then we host our content privately tailored around specific archetypes and give them access upon request.\n\nThis is obviously specific to my business. The b2b and positive impact space. \n\nWhen it comes to your business, you need to figure out what works for you. What is sustainable for you. What is aligned with your values as a person and as a company. Because the reality is that anything that doesnt, generates friction which leads do dead ends and wasted resources when you eventually abandon this.\n\nBusinesses and people are very alike. Each has a personality, boundaries, history, context etc. if you do something because it’s who you are, you will attract more of what you put out. If you put out what you are not aligned with, you will get more of what you are not aligned with.\n\nDouble down on what you do or your business does well. \n\nDo less, more.",

Sadly, most tech meetups are shit, but if you can find one that is specifically focused on CEOs (meaning no service providers looking for sales or ICs looking to get hired), you’ll quickly find that there are MANY people doing the same work as you and experiencing the same wild ups and downs. \n\nLastly, even if you can’t talk to them about your work, you have to maintain relationships with other people. You need a friend group. There’s an old recovery phrase that “connection is the opposite of addiction”. We are social creatures. We need human interaction. Find a men’s group. Stay connected with friends and play videogames (in person!) or grab dinner or anything to spend time building great memories with other people. \n\nOtherwise, even if you become hugely successful, you’ll still be lonely and depressed. \n\nEdit: spelling ",

      "selftext": "When I first started my business here in LA, I was that guy who thought contracts were only for people who didn’t trust each other. Everything we did was based on a handshake, a few texts, and “we’ll figure it out later.” It felt easy and honest until real money got involved. That’s when things started falling apart. A few missed payments, miscommunication over who owned what and suddenly everyone remembered things differently. I had to learn the hard way that paperwork doesn’t kill trust it protects it.   \nNow, every deal, every partnership, even small projects it all goes in writing. It makes things smoother and honestly saves friendships too.  \nAnd I’ve kind of started seeing it the same way in my personal life. Even something like a prenup isn’t about mistrust its just being clear early, before emotions or money complicate things",

Came from a disadvantaged background, spent some months homeless as a child with my whole family living in a 1 bed B&amp;B that they packed a sofa bed into. I'm 34 now, life is so different and I worked really hard to get here. But I remember when I was 27 I had just been listed as a 30 under 30 rising star of my industry in a national title and meanwhile my elderly mum and I were renting a horrible flat where the electrics were shot, there were mice in the walls and black mould. The imposter syndrome was real. My closest friend has an evening more amazing career trajectory and now makes $200k a year but she sleeps on the floor of a crowded house while supporting her mum with her family of 4 and her dad who's in the late stages of dementia. She looks pristine whenever you see her but behind closed doors she's trying to cover everything for her family. She works remotely and no one really know the reality of her situation. So believe me when I say everyone is just keeping up appearances.",

They see “Sir” as an older more respected term of endearment when speaking to an authority male, and “mam” for female. But the biggest thing is it’s a sign of respect. \n\nAlthough you feel like an imposter, you still have a bit of training and education, and your reviews and compliments should reflect that if you are doing a good job. If your business is still going you can’t “suck” that bad if you are still up and running. And I’m gonna waiver and bet you are YouTubing things and learning things outside of school on how to keep this business going and learn more. School Vs Real world experience is invaluable. \n\nLastly, you are 21. You are an adult. You can drive a car, go to a bar, carry a fire arm, drink, serve in the military. Do they really let “kids” serve in the military? Sorry to take your innocence away lol! \n\nSo, “Sir” good job on closing the deal, keep up the good work, and for God sakes take the compliment of someone respecting you as a business owner!",

      "selftext": "Okay so this is kinda wild. I've been messing around with n8n for like 3-4 months now, mostly just building random shit for myself because I'm a nerd and it's fun.\n\nLast month I'm sitting in Starbucks (yeah yeah I know) trying to look productive, and this real estate lady next to me is VENTING to her friend about how she keeps missing leads. Like she's legitimately stressed about it. Something about Zillow inquiries coming in at weird hours and by the time she sees them the next day, people have already connected with other agents.\n\nNow normally I mind my own business but I'd literally just watched a tutorial on webhook automations the night before so I'm like... I could fix that? So I do the awkward lean-over thing and I'm like \"sorry I couldn't help overhearing but I actually build automation stuff, I might be able to help?\"\n\nShe looked at me like I was trying to sell her a timeshare lmao but she gave me her business card anyway.\n\nWhat I actually built her: Basic webhook setup to catch form submissions from her website. Auto-reply email that goes out in like a minute saying \"thanks I got your message, I'll hit you back soon\". Everything dumps into a Google Sheet so she can see all her leads in one place. Her phone gets an SMS whenever a new lead comes in (she LOVED this part). If she doesn't check off that she contacted them within 24hrs, they get an automatic follow-up.\n\nHonest to god it took me maybe 6 hours? And half of that was me googling \"how to format SMS in n8n\" and troubleshooting why the webhook kept timing out , seems i had wrong webhook.\n\nI charged her $450 because I literally had no idea what to charge and that felt like a big number but not TOO big ya know?\n\nPlot twist: Two weeks later she calls me HYPED. Apparently a lead came through at like 11pm on a Saturday night - she was already in bed but got the text, sent a quick reply from her phone, and ended up closing the deal. The commission? Twelve. Thousand. Dollars.\n\nShe literally said \"you just paid for yourself like 25 times over\" and then referred me to two other agents in her office.\n\nIf you're thinking about doing this: Dude just start. Real estate agents need basic stuff, not rocket science. Maybe do a cheap/free first project to get a testimonial and build confidence. These people have actual budgets if you save them time. You don't need to be some automation god, you just gotta solve an actual problem they have.\n\nAnyway I'm rambling but I'm just hyped because this actually worked. Happy to answer questions if anyone wants to try this!",

          "body": "Very valid point. Entrepreneurship is one of those things that will definitely let your insecurities creep up to the surface, and you will doubt yourself a million times along the way.\n\n  \nHowever, there are a few things that I feel have helped me:\n\n1. Rather than trying to build a business, obsess over an idea. Find an idea that you know the world will be better for it, then go out there and make it a reality. The belief in the idea and its importance will help you overcome those dark days\n\n2. Surround yourself with a solid support system. I am not just talking about loved ones (those are important); I am talking about other entrepreneurs and business people. Entrepreneurship can be a lonely journey some times, and during those periods, you want to be able to reach out to other people who will understand what you are going through. Better yet, they can give you feedback and let you know if your business has room for growth\n\n3. Whether you are building a product or offering a service, always try to focus on small metrics rather than drastic ones. For instance, if you are doing an outreach campaign, a mistake I see is founders focusing on number of calls booked. Instead, start small and focus on number of email opens and try to improve that. Once you feel that has been improved enough, work on the email's copy and start measuring number of link clicks. If you keep working on these smaller elements, the bigger picture will take care of itself.\n\nThe bottom line is that entrepreneurship is all about grit. That matters more than intelligence and more than having a great idea.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been a long-time lurker in communities like this and noticed something interesting. We talk a lot about SaaS, e-commerce, drop-shipping, and agencies. But a business model that has been my entire career for the last decade is almost never mentioned: **Comparison Websites.**\n\nI started as an employee at a large comparison site company, then launched my own successful one, and now I consult for others. I wanted to share a bit about this world because I genuinely believe it's one of the most solid online business models out there for solo founders or small teams.\n\nFull disclosure: this isn't \"easy money\" or a get-rich-quick scheme. It takes real work upfront. But if you crack the code, it's an incredibly rewarding and scalable business.\n\n**So, what the hell is a comparison site?**\n\nAt its core, you're a digital expert who helps people make better purchasing decisions.\n\nThink about any time you've had to buy something complex:\n\n* \"What's the best project management software for a small team?\"\n* \"Which VPN is the fastest for streaming?\"\n* \"What's the cheapest pet insurance for a bulldog?\"\n\nA good comparison site answers these questions clearly and objectively. You become the trusted advisor.\n\n**The Business Model in a Nutshell**\n\nIt’s a simple flywheel:\n\n1. **Pick a Playground (Niche):** You choose a specific category to become an expert in. This can be anything from software and finance to home goods or online courses.\n2. **Build Your \"Store\" (The Website):** This is your digital real estate. It's where you publish reviews, comparisons, and \"best of\" lists. The goal is to be genuinely helpful.\n3. **Get People in the Door (Traffic):** You attract people who are actively looking for answers, using creative traffic channels - SEO, PPC, social media (Facebook, Instagram, X, Reddit, and more). Some of these audiences come with strong purchase intent, while others require nurturing through content and trust before they convert.\n4. **Get Paid (Monetization):** When a visitor reads your content and decides to buy, they click a link on your site. That link takes them to the company's website (e.g., the software company, the insurance provider). You then get paid a commission for sending them that customer. This is usually done via affiliate marketing.\n\nThat's it. You are essentially a matchmaker between confused buyers and good companies.\n\n**Why is this a great model for founders?**\n\n* **You don't create a product.** No manufacturing, no coding a complex app.\n* **You don't handle inventory or customer service.** Your job ends when the user clicks your link.\n* **It's a sellable asset.** A profitable site is a digital property that can be sold for a significant multiple of its monthly profit.\n* **It can become semi-passive.** Once a page ranks well on Google, it can earn you money for months or years with minimal maintenance.\n\n**Now, for the reality check. What are the challenges?**\n\nThe biggest hurdle is patience. Sometimes things do click fast - a certain page takes off, a niche gets traction early, or traffic suddenly spikes. But more often, it takes experimentation and persistence: publishing more content, testing new angles, and trying different channels until you figure out what really works for your niche. You have to be willing to put in the work upfront without guaranteed results, and stay adaptable as you learn what moves the needle. Secondly, competition is real. Some niches are dominated by huge players, so you have to be strategic and find a unique angle or sub-niche to get your foot in the door. Finally, your content *must* be high quality. In a world of AI-generated noise, building trust and providing genuine value is the only way to win long-term.\n\nAgain, it takes time to build authority and traffic. But you're building a real, defensible asset.\n\nI just wanted to put this model on your radar because I haven't seen it discussed. Happy to answer any general questions about how the industry works.\n\nWhat do you all think? Has anyone else ever considered this path?\n\n",

Google best of anything and you will see the results littered with them.

I tried CPA, affiliate marketing, freelancing you name it. None of it clicked for me. The only things that brought in a little cash were surveys and game offers, and even then, the pay wasn’t great.\n\nI’ve been jumping from one thing to another, just hoping to find something that actually works for me. I really don’t have the time or energy to throw into something that eats up my whole day. Things are rough, I can barely afford food or basics. No matter how hard I try, I keep hitting dead ends.\n\nI even decided to focus on something I actually care about, just to see if it felt better. So, I built a Chrome extension that helps people where their researches. A few people used it, it even got featured , but honestly, it didn’t go anywhere. I’m not expecting to blow up with thousands of users, but it’s tough not to feel like I wasted all that time. It took me 4-5 months to finish that extension while seeking help on Discord Servers.\n\nI feel like a failure sometimes, especially when I look at how much time I’ve put in for almost nothing. I can’t even cover my basic needs, and finding a job feels impossible and I've applied to over a hundred jobs and nothing’s landed. I’m not asking to get rich, just want to be able to handle my own stuff without stressing about every little thing.\n\nI’m actually pretty good at computer repairs, so I tried offering my services on platforms like Fiverr, but my gig barely got any attention. Then I switched to cryp-to, and wow, so many scammers out there just trying to take your money with zero intention of helping. Funny enough, the only thing that made me any real money was gambling. I made about a hundred bucks, but I had to quit before it I become addicted. Seriously, don’t mess with gambling, so it’s not worth it.\n\nSome nights I can’t even sleep because my mind just keeps running in circles about all this stuff. I’m burned out, anxious, and it feels like I’m never going to hit my goal.\n\nI can accept failures, but I just need to find something sustainable that I can visualize it in a way that will be guaranteed.\n\nSorry for the long rant. I know it’s not your problem, and maybe it’s annoying to read, but I just needed to say it. I’m 18, by the way.",

If it's not working, change strategies, not businesses. You have to be willing to put in 80hr weeks, especially when things get hard, so find joy in what you do.\nI've \"tried\" 7 or 8 businesses over the years.

          "body": "Find a sales role. \n\nLook for a company that crosses verticals and subject matters that you've explored and look for an entry level account executive position. \nBased on the number of books I've read from founders/biz folks (e.g., Ready Fire Aim, Making Money is Killing Your Business, Rich Dad's Before You Quit Your Job) and some experience: the main role of an entrepreneur is sales; to paraphrase Michael Materson (RFA), in the initial startup phase that's all that matters: build something good enough to sell. \n\nIn business someone has to make the widgets [1] and someone has to sell them [2] - the sooner you figure out which one you are the more you can focus on that. But if you want to \"train\" to become an entrepreneur one day, you have to learn how to sell [3].\nIf you don't have a technical background to build stuff, look for a role in sales at a company ideally technology because it's lucrative, fast paced and you'll get exposure to build your social capital. If it's not an option retail can help to start building your sales skills. Not only will this give you the real skill set you'll realistically need as a business owner, but it can give you some cash and capital to give you some breathing room. \n\nGetting a job:\n\nWhy do people hire employees? Because their trying to delegate and scale their business through human labour. \n\nWhat does a business do? It generates value for customers by solving their problems in exchange for money. Instead of making a hamburger yourself you go to MacDonalds because it's a system that focuses on solving a problem: fast, affordable, convenient, consistent quality. \n\nHow can you stand out in \"applying for a job\"? Think like a contrarian and get creative (also a good skillset of an entrepreneur).\n\nQ: If 40K people are applying through the same job posting, how can you differentiate yourself? \n\nA: By not playing the same game everyone else is playing.\n\nInstead find a way to get into direct contact with the decision maker of the hiring (usually hiring manager) and demonstrate your value, how you can solve their problems (making widgets, selling widgets or increasing performance of the former or latter). \n\nThis can be sending a cold email to the person introducing yourself and providing some value which requires diligence, research and work [3].\n\ne.g., \nHi Hiring Manager XYZ,\n\nI noticed you're hiring for position Account Executive, based on some analysis of your competitor ABC's products, I think DEF has the superior QRT because H, J, and K reasons.\n\nI was curious so I did some poking around and had some ideas of potential prospects that might generate some deals moving forward:\n\n1. Name at Company A - Title\n2. Name at Company B - Title\n3. Name at Company C - Title\n\nI think #3 has decision making authority and Company C has recently raised its Series B round and is in need of &lt;DEF product&gt;.\n\nAny interest in getting on a call to discuss?\n\nMy cell: ...; or feel free to send me a Calendly link.\n\nI'm not an expert but maybe that gives some food for thought.\n\n---\n\n[1] The problem with your approach thus far, at least as I read it, is your taking the \"spread fire shot approach\" - this can work if it's in your free time, but if you're burning real cash -- you have to focus on the *problems* you want to solve for other people instead of random widgets and gadgets. Businesses exist to help people solve their problems (See \"Jobs to Be Done Theory\") - most of the time at your age, you just don't have enough real world experience to know what a mid-level manager at a technology company (who is your product's prospect) needs and struggles with, instead you spin your wheels building B2C products (really hard). \n[2] Robert Kiyosaki's path to becoming a business owner and investor was this way too. \n[3] Sales today is not the same as 20 years ago, it's not the sleazy car salesman instead it's taking the role of a trusted advisor - see Dale Carnegie's Sell!",

So you need to decide on something and stick to it.\n\nYou need to test your idea with the market. If they're not buying it, it doesn't mean the idea is wrong.

This will give you time to work online without jumping around so you can get clear on what suits you best.\n\nDo what you enjoy because it will drain the life out of you if you don't,  and it will help you stay excited and motivated. \n\nYou mentioned computer repairs.

Met a mentor on TikTok joined his discord met people just like me hungry to make it out , some bs happened with the mentor that me and some of the students in there decided to leave and make our own free discord and brought some people with us, we all been in this journey now for a year , one of the homies now he’s 24 just like me closed a $30k trade off gold that took him like 1 hr to make another friend of ours , she’s a mom lol , but her dedication to learn this is as much as all of us last week aswell she made $12k off a trade aswell , including myself , after a year of locking back in I finally broke the cycle and everything clicked I took my first ever payout of $1,800 off a prop firm called topstep , my birthday is in may and I’m on a mission to have $25k in Cash by then , I tell you this bc I can tell your hungry for more and if you are up for the late night , studying , starring at candle sticks , learn to trade , yes 90% of people fail but that’s bc they don’t have fully control of there emotion / psychology, and that’s #1 before you see any results \n\nIf you up for the challenge and want it as bad as you want to breathe here’s a good start , on YT search up “tjr bootcamp” \n\nYou may see that people talk sh*t about this guy but he’s 23 with a freaking koenigsegg AT23!!! If your bashing on him that just speaks about yourself and your mindset bc some people just hate on him while others like me see it as motivation to get out of this rat race, \n\nAnyways , his boot camps videos are beginner friendly and i recommend him to almost anyone who has no clue about trading. \nIt’s not impossible, you just got to want it as bad as you want to breathe , Goodluck if you do decide to take this path , don’t tell anyone not even your parents or closest friend that you want to trade bc off the rip they’ll tell you “ it’s gambling” but as a someone who’s spent every dollar on this combines accounts to pass and get funded  so I can actually make money and finally seeing my growth , I’m telling you F**k what anyone else thinks, you’re young rn your able to take more risk compared to a 30 year old \n\nI tell you this bc in our homie discord we got people that are 19 , 20 , 21 all of us starting to print money and we can see the change happening in front of our eyes , but I promise you this , every single person making money in trading has gone thru hell learning this skill set IT IS NOT EASY BUT IT SURELY ISNT IMPOSSIBLE",

At first it feels amazing, you’re free, no one’s breathing down your neck, but then that freedom turns into this weird pressure because *everything* depends on you. No structure, no deadlines, no one to tell you what’s “enough.” What helped me was creating fake structure, setting my own work hours, planning my day the night before, even making small rules like “no phone until I finish this task.” It sounds boring, but it keeps you grounded. Also, be kind to yourself, it takes time to adjust after years of having your day decided for you. Freedom’s great, but it needs discipline to actually feel good. You’ll find your rhythm.",

This last one is the most productive,  but all of them were a way to hide from my insecurities.  When im involved in work, im not dealing with relationship issues, trust, thoughts of fat ot thin, family problems,  money, past mistakes,  deep heart break. As a trained recovery specialist,  I know what's going on, and I still choose work. I have to intentionally carve out time in my life to actively heal from the things I am working so hard at hiding from.  And it's not that I think this is wrong. Rather it's that I know if I dont invest in my mental health, I will never be as successful as I hope to be. Many people succeed without out killing themselves in the process.  Balance. What's that? Oh yes, it's that 30 minute I take to meditate and refocus. Its that time I schedule to spend time with my grandchildren.  Its that 3 day camping trip I take by myself with work, but also walks on the beach, photography,  and my journal. These things are important.",

      "selftext": "**A bit of context**  \nI have been building mobile apps for a long time. I also ran an agency in Europe that shipped consumer apps. In the last two years I learned as much as in the eight years before. Consumer can work, but it is hard. There is a lot of competition. Many teams are funded. Good branding and design matter. Ads and store strategy matter. Vibecoding helps with speed, but it does not give you product sense or design skills. Most solo builders don’t have all of that.\n\n**What this is about**  \nI started building internal mobile apps for small businesses. These apps are private. The icon has their logo. The data is theirs. The app runs one important job their team does every day. Owners can build it. Or a builder can build it for them. The value is simple: fewer mistakes, faster hand-offs, cleaner records, money collected sooner.\n\n**What the apps do, in plain terms**  \nField work: the worker arrives, taps “start,” takes photos, collects a signature, taps “done,” and the invoice is sent.  \nStudios and salons: bookings are kept in one place, reminders go out on time, no double booking.  \nShops and wholesalers: scan items, update stock, get a clean export for accounting.  \nForms and compliance: fill forms offline, require all fields, get a signed PDF saved in the right folder.\n\n**Pricing and learning to watch**  \nSome platforms look cheap, then get expensive with seats, credits, or add-ons. Read what counts as usage. Check if you can export the project. Check who owns the data. Test the tool before paying. Plan time to learn it. One focused week now is cheaper than rebuilding later.\n\n**What must be solid**  \nThese are utility apps. One core feature must work every time.  \nIf the core is booking, the app must not lose state.  \nIf the core is notifications, they must arrive on time.  \nIf the core is inventory, scans must be reliable.  \nIf the core is forms, offline must work and signatures must stick.  \nNice screens do not fix broken behavior.\n\n**Ownership and scope**  \nKeep the brand of the business. Icon, splash, wording. Keep the data with the business. Keep roles simple. Decide if the app is only for staff or also for clients to see status or book. Fewer options means more use.\n\n**A simple way to build and improve**  \nMake a small version that runs end to end. Put it on the phones of the people who do the job. Watch where they get stuck. Fix the biggest problem. Ship again. Repeat once or twice. When it feels smooth for them, brand it fully and roll it out.\n\n**How to build**  \nI am technical, and for this kind of job I would not use Cursor. I would pick a mobile-focused vibecoding platform with three qualities: a good code model that handles real app logic (not only UI), built-in help for store tasks like signing, builds, TestFlight or internal testing, and App Store and Play submission, and clear pricing that stays reasonable without surprise per-seat or credit spikes. I use Vibecode App. It is free to start, the credit system is fair, and it is easy to ramp up. Whatever you choose, test navigation, state, auth, and push on real devices before you commit.\n\n**How to charge**  \nCharge a monthly fee that includes support and small improvements. Add a setup fee if there are integrations or data migration. Be clear on what is included. No surprise bills.\n\n**Reddit can help**  \nSpend time where your users talk. Read pain posts. Do not spam. Good places to start: smallbusiness, salons, truckers etc (there is a TON). Search for “no-show,” “double booking,” “inventory count,” “invoice delay.” Build the fix they describe.\n\n**Last tip**  \nIn many industries, just saying “we have a mobile app” still helps, even if the first version is simple. It opens doors. Then you earn trust by making one workflow work very well.",

Clients still come to me with problems that I have to use my mind to determine and infer who all the key players will be based on the customer's situation, which I can quickly eyeball within a few seconds in a conversation, whereas an AI, you have to feed it an entire storyline where what one assumes is always missed. AI has mostly gotten rid of my need for grunt workers. Those are the guys who are truly screwed. I no longer need to pay someone to make a design for me. I no longer need to ask someone to write a series of emails for me. All the low level tasks are replaceable because they require very little direction. \n\nIf you have a passion for IT, you will be the person who uses the AI tools to accomplish things without the need of low level workers, so your profits are actually higher in the end or you pass the savings onto the client and gain more clients.\n\nCompanies still need to hire IT workers because of the human element which is far more advanced than any AI  currently in the world.",

Signup for freelance work websites like upwork,etc (start with 2,3 popular and trusted ones)\n\nNow comes trust which will be your biggest entry barrier in any field. To build trust\n1. Reddit- start posting and commenting on your niche sub reddit(genuine help is what you are supposed to do, do not sell your services, remember you are here to build trust)\n2. Linkedin- start posting 3x a week for 2 months, see what kind of posts are working and then double down on it, your post should resonate with your ideal customer base.\nWhile you do that you can simultaneously start approaching people on LinkedIn and people on sub reddits if they require your services. What their immediate pain points are that you can resolve with your skill set.\nRemember while you create content you are supposed to engage with other people's content especially who are doing well in your field of service.\n\nApproach method:\nStart DM ing people who interact with your post and introduce yourself and what you do, do not sell them anything, yet. Once you have little trust and they know you you can ask them about what their pain points are that you can resolve for them with your skill sets. Most people will be open to discussing it since you are not an unknown character for them now.\n\nStart with this first then you will understand, improve and make your own strategies as you go \n\nPS- Think of this as a starter kit so you are not lost while you take the first step.",

      "selftext": "Hi,\n\n**Background**: I was doing well at my job. It was a newly launched staffing agency based in NJ. At that time, it had no clients. I worked there for about 3 years and established the brand.\n\nThen, I decided to work for my own business, I resigned on Sep 26. On October 1st, I started my own marketing agency.  \nI registered an LLC and secured a few projects in the first month. They were small companies with less than 10 employees, as I wanted to start with smaller ones.\n\nI am into lead generation and have about 15 years of experience, so lead generation is like a daily task for me.\n\nAll my 5 clients want to grow their businesses by getting more customers. They don’t care what I am doing, what methods I am working on, or how much social media is helping. Nothing. They just NEED MORE BUSINESS. That’s it.\n\n  \n**The Real Struggle Starts Here:**  \n  \nTo deliver the desired results, I have been spending 8 to 10 hours daily, thinking about new strategies and ideas. I have dedicated one whole day to each project. On Saturday and Sunday, I review the past work and make strategies for the next week.\n\nThere are no off days, no relaxing days, no holidays. I get up in the morning, open my two laptops, and the same process starts again. I hired many resources and employees to share my work, but they could not meet the clients’ expectations.  \nSo, my employees just follow my instructions. These are low-paying projects, that’s why I cannot hire experienced people like project managers, etc.\n\nFurthermore, due to this stressful workload, I couldn’t market my own agency. Its social media pages are inactive.  \nI used to write on Quora and had millions of views there, but now I hardly post once a week.\n\nAfter all expenses, I am earning less than $500 per month now. That means around $6,000 per year, while this was the amount I used to earn every month earlier, working only 8 hours a day, no stress, full 9 hours of sleep, and a peaceful mind.\n\n**The only positive thing I have achieved here is the happiness of my clients. They are getting the leads they expected from me. In fact, my clients love me, and I love working for them.**\n\nBut I think I cannot take this stress anymore.\n\n1. Either I have to choose decent clients who can pay me what I truly deserve,\n2. Or go back to a full-time job again and offer part-time marketing consultation.\n\n**What I learned**\n\n1. Every business wants more clients, not more noise. That’s what I help them get, real, measurable growth. Just wish I had more time to do the same for myself.\n2. Sometimes, chasing freedom ends up costing peace. But even if it’s tough, I’d still choose my own path, because lessons like these can’t be learned in a 9-to-5.\n3. Skills in your field+time management = SUCCESS\n\n ",

          "body": "I recommend building out pro forma financials to see what the numbers need to look like to get you paid what you need in X months. What your margins would likely be. What salary you need. Once you know your revenue target, you can try to back into how many clients at $X per month you'll need. If you have $500/month clients and you need $10,000/month in revenue to drive the comp you need, you'll need 20 clients at that rate. If you can start landing larger clients, say $3,000/month, you only need 3-4. \n\nWhen I started my accounting business, we started with startups that seemed cool at that time. We quickly realized to grow to the size we anticipated with our businesses, we'd need way too many $300/mo type bookkeeping engagements. That's a hell of a lot of work. Often times, smaller clients still have a lot of asks. So we quickly realized our ideal customer profile needed to shift. The level of service we expected to deliver was not meant of for startups. It was 7-figure businesses. \n\nSo you're on the same path as most new business owners. You take on small gigs across various industries and don't get paid much, if anything. You're sacrificing a salary to build your service lines and learn what does and does not work. You're working in the business, not on it. \n\nYou'll want to shift from doing the work to having people do the work. They'll never be as good as you when you're small. You need to scale to get out of that challenge. Read the eMyth book to learn more about working on versus in. I also recommend Fix This Next. That will help you determine where exactly you should be spending your time. Most likely, it will be your sales funnel.",

What I learned as self-employed is a huge help now, and most importantly - I am motivated mostly by my own desire to achieve results, more assertive and decisive, and can easily understand a lot of aspects of the business.",

Outsource small, repetitive tasks.\n\nSecond, you may also find it worthwhile to look into 'Arbitrage'. \n\nYou hire another company to generate the leads - you enrich them or whatever your deliverable requires, add your markup, and in turn provide the polished lead to your client.  \n\nI built an entire side business of providing leads to other companies, some paid by the lead and others by monthly retainer (Larger projects). \n\nIt's not easy - you will need to source and thoroughly vet lead providers while constantly monitoring quality, but the model does work.\n\nHope this helps!",

Or do it now.\n\nIf they stay, you're making more money. \n\nIf they leave, you have less stress and can focus on bringing in high paying clients.\n\nIf you can keep 2 or 3 you're now making the same money but with much more freedom.\n\nThen for every new client keep that rate or raise it even more! Keep increasing prices until you're getting no after no.  \n\nBuild case studies. Get out in the world and network. Meet people. Build relationships. I don't care what year it is nothing beats in real life relationships for early stage growth &amp; sales in a service based business. \n\nGet feedback on your local chamber of commerce from current members(use their directory to call people who are on it and ask them if they have a few minutes to share their opinion....guess what after you've started talking they'll be curious what you do. Now they know 😏.). Maybe join a few of them. Put in major effort. One or two might suck but damn if one works out you'll find yourself a few new customers. Nail down your local SEO. Grow from the inside out geographically.\n\nFind local founder meetups, happy hours etc.\n\nOnce you're doing that be active on LinkedIn and don't post AI garbage. Post actual valuable content and really give people a window into running your agency. Let them be a part of these wins and losses (not client wins or losses but yours as a founder, things you've learned, share stories). Share your plans, strategies you're using to find clients and generate leads for yourself and clients. Bring them in your world.\n\nAnd use your lead generation skills. I know it's scary to spend a budget in the early days. But once you've found a bit of security by attacking things old school use that money to pour some fuel on the fire. \n\nGet creative on some fun campaigns that don't cost ad spend dollars. Set up a table in the busiest park or during a busy event with a shittttty sign that says generate more leads for your business. Ask me anything. (Just an example of a scrappy idea you can do over and over).\n\n$100 profit per client in the USA isn't worth it unless it's strictly to build great case studies but you've had plenty of time to do that. \n\nTime to take the next step.

I have chased quick wins, had accounts shut down, and watched projects I poured a year into implode, so I know how perfectionism and fear of looking stupid can become a time sink. That experience taught me to trade future proofing for rapid learning, and that shift saved my energy and sanity. As a coach who has rebuilt after multiple setbacks and career pivots, I get where you are coming from. \n\nHere are simple steps you can use right now. Set a two week deadline to ship a tiny version that proves the one core value you think users need, then iterate weekly based on real reactions. Talk to many more people than feels comfortable, aim for dozens, and ask direct questions about the problem, willingness to pay, and how they solve it now. Remove features, not add them, focus on one metric that measures learning not vanity. Finally, create a brief accountability loop, for example share weekly progress with one trusted peer and schedule 30 minute user interview blocks on your calendar. You are already curious, resilient, and willing to learn, that will carry you farther than chasing perfection. I can help sketch a two week launch plan or a short interview script if you want. Remember, speed of learning saves you time and money. \n\nAustin Erkl - Entrepreneur Coach",

If though you contacted them about a verifiably fake review and refused to pay they would without any subtlety explain that knowing this review was hurting a real business they would not only leave it up but promote it heavily via seo and other methods as well as search out other existing negative reviews or people willing to give negative reviews. \n\nYou either paid up or every search associated with your business be it name or market in your area would get the worst reviews presented high up in the results. \n\nI paid a lawyer and in the end found that they were legally untouchable and that it was much cheaper to just pay the extortion and move on than it was to try and fight it. \n\nIt was one of the things during a rough 6 year period that led me to see our legal system for what it has actually become.

          "body": "Yelp does exist because it primarily falls under the legal umbrella of free speech and public opinion. The platform definitely positions itself as a public forum where consumers can share their experiences. These experiences can be good, bad, or sometimes even fabricated. And this is because it's all user-generated content. We need to understand that Yelp isn't held directly liable for what users post under Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act. In simple terms we can say that they do provide the megaphone, but not the message. I would say it's perfectly legal for anyone to create a review of a business listing, even without the owner's consent, as long as the content doesn't meet the legal definition of defamation. So while Yelp's survival might seem insane to many of us, it's definitely not illegal. We should understand that it's just internet, unfiltered and unregulated.\n\nYou can ask your customers to share their experiences on yelp and this should help boost the review score. If you look at the review pages of largest companies in the world you will realise that the percentage of negative review is more then positive ones. This is primarily because happy customers usually do not care about leaving review. Fear is not reality. You will have so many positive reviews and just in some time that negative review will go down and your profile will shine again.\n\nSearch for Delete Yelp Reviews on google there are some sites that offer such services.\n\nI hope this helps.",

In most small claims courts, you need permission from the judge but they will likely grant your request if it's reasonable. Yelp will not like being sued and probably delete the information and block the villain.\n\nThis shouldn't take too long. File the case, request permission from the judge, file discovery, and go to court if necessary. If you drop the case against Yelp, then you can still go after the villain if you want compensation and revenge. I don't know how you prove damages but Google should have some guidance. \n\nIf you get a judgment against the villain, then collecting is another process but they can be forced to a deposition to provide their banking information and other assets. If they are a no show for this deposition, this will be civil contempt of court and they will have a warrant for their arrest. I believe they sit in jail until they comply or make bail promising to show. \n\nLiens and wage garnishment are yet another step in the process after deposition. You can attach their bank account and go after their wages and other eligible assets which another step in the paperwork process. Homesteads are generally exempt so you can't file a lien against it.\n\nThe best part about your case is these are what are known as intentional torts which cannot be discharged through bankruptcy. The villain is stuck with it forever and it's earning interest at the statutory rate which is 6% in my state.\n\nThis is an undertaking but if you have a penchant for revenge, you can go after the villain.",

It’s important to me to see a democratized record of quality and what to expect that the business can not tamper with or control the narrative of.

Also people spend more on credit.\n\nGive customers a discount it it really bothers you or charge a fee for use of the card. I wouldn’t personally because people don’t like it.",

Instagram/Tiktok isn't much better but I like to think of those more as algo-based galleries vs classic social media, so your interactions on them tend to be a bit more genuine. These platforms are their own can of worms too though, and they really aren't appropriate unless you're a business that is served well via short form video/picture posts (like trying to sell designer shirts or a \"viral product\"). I mostly use ours as a dumping ground for low effort content that is visible on our website, to give potential customers a sense of who we are rather than actually trying to go viral on it.",

She had 12 people confirmed and asked if she could just pay me the time of the tour if more friends decided to join. It turned out to be 18, but then several dropped out after a few minutes. It was chaotic because they were chatty and I had to herd them and look out for stragglers. I wasn't used to such a large group. I had 16 complete the tour. The whole day had been stressful so I was distracted and forgot to make sure the first person paid me for the extra 4 people before ending the tour last night. Today I'm texting her for the extra tickets and so far she's not answering. Hoping she will eventually, but what can I do if she doesn't? That's $140. May not seem like much, but I'm just one person and that can pay some bills. ",

          "body": "Yeah, moving forward, if they want to add to the tour, your new rule is that payment for added participants after the first booking must be received 48 hours in advance of the tour. \n\nHave a number in mind that you prefer to entertain. That number is a bit lower than what you are able to entertain. Now you are realizing that 16 people is a lot. Moving forward, do not go over the usual 12 people, but if a group asks in advance “hey is there any way it could be 14 or 15?” your answer is yes, but you require payment for them 48 hours in advance, otherwise they will be asked to leave at the time of the tour. They should know this, because now it’s in a contract that they sign. \n\nNow let’s say that someone *doesn’t ask* because of course, that’s going to happen. Either the extra participants are not allowed to participate, or, they have to pay a $10 convenience/last minute fee on top of the ticket fee. The booker shouldn’t gawk at this, because they will have signed a contract upon payment that says “I understand that any added participants must be agreed upon with the tour guide and paid in full at least 48 hours in advance of the tour. Failure to communicate and pay for them in advance will result in those participants to be turned away from the tour unless the extra participants pay for their ticket plus a $10 convenience fee before the tour starts.” \n\n\nIf you don’t have a contract that they sign, get one.

You bent the rules to be nice but in the process found yourself stressed and now even literally shortchanged. \n\nOr, if people must have more than 12 then charge accordingly and have a helper assist that would get paid...as in maybe tickets are $10 per person for the 12 person limit and if we add on folks then it becomes $15 per person.\n\nMake everyone pay upfront whether this be at the time of booking or upon arrival, no exceptions...no payment, no moving forward with the tour. I have found after being in business for years that people do not care about you or your bottom line (finances)...they want what they want and if you give a freebie or overlook some aspect they are going to take it or take advantage of your generosity. People have a hard time respecting or understanding that in some professions it may not be a \"tangible\" item of exchange but rather the exchange of TIME that they are paying for....it is the oh, well what is one more person, or an extra 30 minutes, etc. Time is money. \n\nBe professional in your attempt to collect:\n\nHello Jane. As you are aware, the max for my tours is normally 12 guests. In an attempt to accommodate your request for a larger party I did agree. However, there is an outstanding balance of $140 which needs to be addressed and paid by Monday. You requested a service and I provided that service. If there is some other outstanding issue please clarify.\" \n\nNormally you might be able to tie in a line about needing to contact the court or the police or some other tactic but I don't think you have that leverage in this case.",

I then offered them a replacement at a reduced cost, and they have also refused this offer and demanded a refund and have started to threaten me. I am really taken back by this situation, especially as it has been 5 years since they purchased this item from me, and the item was quality checked before shipping.\n\nDo they have a claim for a full refund after the lengthy time period?

          "body": "There is a difference between a refund policy and a warranty.  Usually a refund policy is like 30 days, and may be store credit only, that type of thing. It enables a husband to buy a gift and return or exchange it if his wife doesn’t like it — meaning the purpose of it is to help you sell more.  Sometimes people will abuse these, the obvious example in your business being to wear something for a party or wedding and then return it or something. Anyway, that’s a return policy. \n\nA warranty is your guarantee that something is made with good workmanship and you will stand by it.  A pavé diamond should not fall out of a ring, for example, and if it does you will replace it maybe. A warranty can be time based or “lifetime” or whatever you decide but the important thing is workmanship. If the item is properly made and the person decides they no longer like it or want it, or they failed to care for it and it’s dirty, or whatever else that does not go to workmanship, it is not your problem to fix this at your expense.  Is the ring moldy because of workmanship?  Is it tarnished because it was improperly coated and the coating wore off (idk about this stuff, just hazarding guesses)?  If so you can repair. If the workmanship is on some dimension truly poor, you can offer a refund. It does not sound like this is the case. \n\nSome jewelers offer free cleaning for life.  This is a nice thing to do but also brings people back to your store maybe to buy more jewelry, so it’s not entirely motivated by generosity. \n\nWhy don’t you tell her, bring the item by, I’ll clean it and take a look at it and see if there’s anything wrong with it.  Clean it and make it look nice. Then say, there’s nothing wrong with it, so I can’t take it as a return. If it can be resold or has value in the precious metals, you can offer to accept it in exchange for a 40% discount on something else in the store or something, and give her those choices. \n\nThere is nothing she can threaten you with that is going to go anywhere in a court of law and I would ignore any such treats and stop responding to her if she won’t stop making them.  Again, this assumes you didn’t sell something of shoddy workmanship with a lifetime guarantee. \n\nYou should make your returns and warranty policies clear and in writing and print them on your receipts. ",

I can just imagine someone buying it on credit then making minimum payments or perhaps defaulted a couple times and now has an astronomical interest rate which they couldnt afford and couldnt even afford the regular rate 5 years ago. Its not like the item can be repo'd or foreclosed like a car or house. They probably are thinking that by refunding through that credit card would somehow undo that initial transaction and get them out of the huge financial debt that they got themselves in. Sadly it doesnt work that way. \n\nBut its jewelry and its been 5 years. So wouldnt the item still have value once its cleaned up and appraised? (Unless it was personalized with engravings or something.) Is there a chance its worth more now then when they had originally bought it? It wouldnt depreciate would it? They could resell it.

It's a fairly nice one. Probably worth $800 or $900.  Flaky hard drive, all told about a $200/fix for replacement drive and reload windows we or else I'm able to recover most of her pictures and other personal files. \n\nShe had also brought along her Microsoft office discs and a few other common applications. We went ahead and loaded those up for her too. \n\nShe brought it in on a love Monday afternoon in July, it was ready for her to pick up Wednesday afternoon.  We called her and left a message that it was ready. \n\nFriday we call again and she answers we confirm that she knows that her machine is ready. She said she would be by to pick it up in a couple of days. \n\nA week later, we call she doesn't answer. We leave her a message reminding her that her computer is ready. \n\nWe do that every week for about a month.  No reply.\n\nSo I tell the employees not to bug her and she will show up when she shows up.  August passes.  On September first I call and leave a message that am the owner of the shop and letting her know that under CA law if she doesn't come pick up her machine we have the option to sell it to satisfy the outstanding bill.\n\nShe calls back an hour later and says she will pick it up tomorrow..\n\nTomorrow comes and goes.  \n\nOctober first I Mail a copy of the invoice, showing an additional storage fee, and a note that if she does not pick up her computer within the next 90 days, it will be sold to satisfy the outstanding bill. \n\nTechnically I only have to wait 30 days  and that 30 passed at the end of August. \n\nNovember 1st I send out another copy of that letter with an additional storage fee and a warning that it will be sold in 60 days. \n\nDecember 1st another copy of that letter , storage fee, the warning will be sold in 30 days.\n\nJanuary 2nd I send out one that I will sell her machine for the amount due on her bill.  Unless she picks it up by January 10th.\n\nNothing..  i waited until Feb 1.  \n\nI  post it on FB with pics and all the specs, price ... The exact amount of her outstanding bill.\n\nI had my tech dump her personal files on a dvd just for sake of argument.  Then reloaded it with a fresh copy of Windows again so as not to include any of the customers personal files.\n\nLaptop was sold on Feb 2nd.  We included the software that she had brought with the laptop when she came in.\n\nFast forward to April 10th.  She shows up at the shop looking for her laptop...it's been 9 months from the time she dropped it off.  Fortunately I was there when she came in. \n\nI told her her computer was sold 2 months ago, for the price of her outstanding bill.  It took about 15 minutes and the arrival of the police department to get her to stop screaming.  \n\nShe of course wanted to file a police report saying that we had stolen her computer etc etc.  one of the cops asked about the whole thing and I gave him the nutshell version of the story above and showed him the invoices... He agreed that there was no crime here. \n\nWe offered her the dvd with her personal files which just enraged her further.  At that point, we're not even obligated to preserve any of her pictures or files.\n\nSo I hoped it was over at that point.... Silly me. \n\nShe called probably close to 50 times over the next 6 months...  And would start giving her sob story about how I had stolen her computer, she would beg various staff members to give her the name of the person that we had sold it to so that she could try to go buy it back from them.\n\nBasically standing instructions became if this lady calls they would direct her to me, at which point she would hang up.\n\nShe filed a complaint with the state agency that regulated our shop.   15-minute phone call and an emailed copy of the invoice, they dropped the investigation as without merit.\n\nShe kept calling about every other month for the next 3 YEARS..  On several occasions she got a new employee who would be concerned until they looked up her account... referred them to me or one of the more experienced techs... And she would hang up.",

Was late first day, late the second day because he crashed the vehicle I gave him to drive (as his own was repossessed in bankruptcy) and wrecked a tyre. Later that week I had to go into hospital overnight for a minor surgery. So I had another friend who also worked for me part time work alongside him and he spent the whole two days talking about how I did all these things the wrong way, didn't like the way I spoke to customers etc...etc. all these pearls of wisdom from an unreliable bankrupt.  \nWhen I was told about this it was a real gut punch. So after only one week the following day I sat him down and told him it wasn't going to work out as firstly I knew about all the shit he was talking, the fact he was persistently late, and he was already talking about 'taking holidays' all after only one week. Paid him an extra 2 weeks pay and said see ya later. He phoned the following day to apologise but hey it was all too late for that.  \nFound in business it's really not worth sticking your neck out for others most of the time, as sadly almost no good deed goes unpunished, that, and to trust your gut instinct about these things as most times it's right.",

      "selftext": "We opened up a music store a few miles from another music store that is focused on different things (we focus on school band instrument repair and rentals, other shop mostly does used gear and sells records) we are about as different as an automotive body shop is to an automotive mechanical repair shop. \n\nI have had only one interaction with the other store - he kicked me out and cursed at me when I went to deliver a package that was mistakenly delivered to us when we first opened. Other than that, I do not know him. \n\nShortly after that interaction, he started advertising that he does \"band instruments rentals\" and offering \"woodwind and brass repair\" - which is what we are focused on. It didn't bother us at all, we do not talk badly of him to anyone. Though many customers have come in and told us some very nasty stories about him - we just say we do not know him and haven't been in his shop. \n\nOver the last year we started getting negative reviews from what appear to be new Google accounts with made up scenarios and stories every other month or so. It is just my husband and I who work here so we really do know every interaction and can back it up with camera footage if need be. \n\nOne review said they took a lesson from us and was treated poorly. At the time of the review, I only had one lesson student, so it was false. After responding to the review that it was fake, the reviewer changed it to, \"called about a repair and no one got back to me\" we checked our voicemail, emails, call log and not a single person had called about repairs that we hadn't replied to. Google will not remove the review. \n\nWe got about 4 more after that and it dropped our 5 star rating to a 4.5, we have gotten a few of them removed, but two won't go away no matter how much reporting. We do reply to all of the reviews and state that what they are saying did not happen and suggest it may have been left for the wrong business. \n\nWe have no proof that it is the other store owner, other than two reviews use the same initials as the guy lol \nEvery single one comes from a google account with 0 other reviews. We have tried to counteract with getting customers to leave 5 star reviews but it still is very frustrating this is happening. \n\nHas anyone dealt with this? Is there anything we can even do other than keep reporting the reviews and encouraging more customers to leave us reviews? Getting people to leave reviews feels like pulling teeth. 😅",

I'm not an attorney but I've filed my share of lawsuits in the past, and actually had an attorney disbarred in Louisiana Supreme Court without representation so I know a little about law. \n\nThe first step-if you are serious about stopping this clear disruption to you and your spouse's ability to operate your business (and you are) - is to begin documenting every instance of interference from the very beginning. \n\nNow before you throw your hands up and say you didn't want to go this far with it, if that's the case you are not that serious about this blatant assault on your livelihood. \n\n 1) You are going to have to retain a lawyer. \n\n 2) You need to bring these documents with you to the \n      lawyer\n\n     Evidence \n\n       a. Screenshots of each review (with timestamps and        \n          \n           platform name(s).\n       \n       b. URLS to the review(s) or reviewer(s) profile(s)\n\n\n       c.

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I run a small IT services company (\\~$1M revenue, 5 employees).\n\nI've been doing the same chaotic thing every year: I use QuickBooks to invoice customers, but I never reconcile bank statements or record expenses during the year. Then tax season hits and my accountant asks for everything. I end up spending a weekend manually going through 12 months of bank statements, matching receipts, categorizing expenses, before sending it all to him. He charges $2k for year-end filing.\n\nThis year it finally caught up with me. I kept postponing the filing because I was dealing with other business challenges and ended up paying penalties to the government. \n\nI only have about 100-120 transactions per month including payroll, so it's not massive volume. My accountant asked $800/month for bookkeeping, but I think I'd still have to send him receipts, bills, statements, answer his emails etc.. etc..  so I'm doing half the work anyway.\n\n**My question:** Is there a middle ground between:\n\n* Doing nothing all year and paying penalties \n* Paying $9k/year for a bookkeeper when I'm still doing half the work\n\nAre any of you in a similar boat? What's working for you? Is monthly bookkeeping actually worth it, or are there tools/approaches that make DIY less painful?",

Bills and receipts are a lot more work but can be optional depending on what your business needs, so if you're looking to do less admin on your end, you can provide your bookkeeper with view only access, and eliminate sortware-based receipt tracking (or track receipts only above certain amounts). You can also use a receipts-only email address that you and your bookkeeper both have access to, or use a receipts tool (i.e. Hubdoc) to streamline things.

Once the system starts learning, it becomes super easy and quick to import, classify, and keep track of everything. They even have started offering AI assistance for reconciling, invoicing in other areas for business insight. You can basically drop in your bank statement or invoice in QuickBooks will pass all the information and do the reconciliation or create a bill for you. \nWe do $2.5 to 3.5 million dollars a year and bookkeeping takes me less than an hour every week.  \nYou definitely need something in place to know how you are doing on a monthly basis, instead of waiting until the end of the year. Even the top-tier QuickBooks online version is only about $200 a month. You can even add a live bookkeeper option for $20 a month and talk to a real person to walk you through any struggles with classifications or journal entires. \nBeing a business owner can be a pain in the ass, but having a firm grasp on your numbers is something you should definitely make time for. You’ll be surprised how little effort it really takes and how much more comfort you’ll have knowing that everything is mostly accurate when you hand it off to your accountant.",

          "body": "Making a second comment for more detail, there is a ton of advice here but here is a playbook:\n\nStarting out:\n\n\\- If you don't have an accountant doing your taxes, get one, non-negotiable  \n\\- HIGHLY recommended: read \"The Accounting Game\". It's written as a kids book/workbook but introduces you to the basics of business accounting very gently. We did this as a workshop in my company for anyone who might talk to clients about budgets/finances and it was immensely beneficial.  \n\\- MINIMUM BAR: put your transaction details in a spreadsheet  \n\\- Preferable: use an accounting system. Wave has a free version and it's a great place to start. Enter your transactions manually, and it will give you a proper balance sheet and P&amp;L. This will make things easier (read: cheaper) for your accountant to do tax prep. You can run invoices from here too.\n\nGrowing up a little:\n\n\\- Use paid version of Wave to automatically connect your bank account OR use another system that does the same (we use Xero, Quickbooks online is the market lead), just run invoices from whatever system you choose.  \n\\- Reconcile transactions once per week in the system, this is generally as easy as picking a category and clicking a button. For your size, should only take 15 mins / week. Get familiar enough with the process so that you can understand it for the next stage. Understanding debits/credits and how they work in a double entry accounting system, vs what types of accounts to use (asset/expense/liability etc..) will give you a foundational education that will help you later in your business as you grow it.\n\nDelegate:\n\n\\- Once you have a system in place, the basics working, and it's getting a little more complex and/or time consuming......get a bookkeeper.  \n\\- Cheap option: Virtual assistant from somewhere like the Philippines. This should get you the basic legwork done pretty easily without having to do anything yourself.  \n\\- More expensive: outsourced bookkeeper / service / agency: this is where we are now, we pay $2500/month and this includes payroll, bookkeeping, and a bunch of tax account management. Invoicing would be included but ours is a bit too project dependent to reliably outsource currently.\n\nTAX: I don't know where you are at specifically, but this is general advice for US based - the other advantage to a good bookkeeper is to find someone who can manage the tax accounts. Unemployment insurance, state by state accounts if you hire in different locations, and a bunch more. These are just awful to self manage.\n\nLast note: later on, a good bookkeeper can help you level up your financial management of the company. For example if you hire sales people, or some internal operations people you may want to categorize them differently to track a more accurate gross margin vs opex vs net margin. When you do this, reconciling payroll suddenly becomes more complex, which is why you need a good bookkeeper, it unlocks more capability as well as managing the mundane stuff you shouldn't be doing.",

Not sure what they do now but ~10 years ago their harshest penalty was to put your site at the literal bottom of all search results, which could mean thousands of pages from the top. \n\nEven if they don’t penalize you directly, they’ll generally see purchases reviews, links, social mentions, etc., as low or no quality. \n\nI don’t know if anyone even uses Yelp anymore but in the past their algorithms wouldn’t even make reviews visible unless the reviewer had done multiple reviews with a mix of good and bad ones. It was a simple metric but it did screen out one-off review from employees or family members as well as paid reviews. \n\nFinally, potential customers quickly learn to ignore spammy reviews and testimonials. \n\nTL;DR: don’t waste your money.

Could something like this succeed, success being $40k/yr income, since the overhead would be so low? No labor costs and very low rent.\n\nThe location is downtown in a mid-sized city of 300k people with a metro over a million.\n\nI would need to sell 15 books per day if relying on book sales alone with the expenses I’d have. It’s a high foot traffic area, and the small bookstore offers novelty especially with the right aesthetic. Also, the space for the inventory would be 10x20, which is enough for a book isle for 4-5 major fiction genres.",

Do you want to do a breakfast rush for the tea?(I’d say in most communities in the United States selling a Tea alone might not be a huge draw, but you never know)\n\nBut to make the kind of money you’re talking about… and I could be way off but assuming you’re open 50 hours a week you probably have to sell $70 worth of books and tea an hour to come close to making it work for you\n\nMaybe the margin on books is better that I think so he get by selling $50 an hour worth of books \n\nBut I think you still have to sell 3000 a week \n\nMaybe maybe I’m off because there’s better margins and used books.

Your space is quite small, though, and I think if you're willing to treat this as a start to your dream store, it could work with a different angle.\n\nDue to the size, I'd look at selling teas and accessories like cool mugs, tea balls, strainers, stirring sticks, etc. I'd also add book accessories like reading lights, bookmarks, fluffy pillows, and tea gift baskets - you get the idea. Make a list of all things tea/books/cozy nook, and I bet there's a lot you could sell!\n\nI do think you'd have to go the more niche, boutique route, and carry harder to find brands and accessories. I can order tea from the grocery store, but it's difficult getting certain brands, and the cool accessories for tea are not readily available in my area - I have to order online or go to a boutique store downtown, lol.\n\nIf you really want to sell books, I think you have to pick 1/2 genres and stick to that for now. Like all things gardening, self-help, or romance, etc. I don't know if it would work, but you could look at having a small pub table with a tablet/laptop where people could maybe order books... \n\nAnyway, I love your bigger goal, and this small space may be a great starter to build towards that goal. You'd have your store name established and, when ready, could make a move to a larger space :)",

You are talking about a specialty book shop, it would have to be about the coffee and it would have to be some crazy good coffee to work. If you are doing a bookstore you need to have an extensive list to get people to come. If you have a coffee shop that happens to sell bagels, muffins, and books, then you can put pretty much anything you want in there that catches people's eye. I own a store that sells books, we have about 300 titles and I sell 3-5 books daily.",

It's a LOT harder and more complicated than you are making it seem so far. A lot of ppl get in over their head because they don't do enough research. And there are way more factors and business costs besides rent and utilities, believe me. Brick and mortar bookstores historically have very low margins. \n\nHave you even thought about an online POS and book inventory organization system, because they aren't cheap. All the little things like business licenses, email and website operating fees, tax, physical supplies, insurance, and more add up so no, it's not as simple as selling 15 books a day. I feel like it's a very simplistic take on it and you need to do more research on what running a business is like. You'd be shocked how long admin stuff can take. \n\nA big draw of brick and mortars is bc ppl like the events, community aspect, bookseller staff knowledge, etc. It's definitely not price, as Amazon exists and you will get ppl who come in, take photos of your books, and buy it on Amazon bc it's cheaper. What do you offer that Amazon doesn't so you can bring people into your store? How are you different , what makes you special? This is something vital to figure out before you start. \n\nDo you know how to create partnerships with different publishers to even get books? Do you know what type of books folks in your area like? Learning your niche and audience will make or break your bookstore anyway as people have particular tastes and it can vary by area in terms of what sells. You can't just stock things you like, you need to stock what sells and what the customers want. It can take time to learn what that is. And it's vital, smaller space means less space to make mistakes and buy books that don't sell. \n\nI do think the idea is really cute but 100% recommend you look more into what you're getting into first, and what running a business and a bookstore is like. Def try to find groups/online resources and hear from veterans who know the industry as it's quite niche.",

          "body": "[Edited For Fornatting]\n\nHey there. First off, mad respect for your drive to build this from the ground up on your own terms. I work in this space, and I completely understand wanting to shield your new project from personal opinions until it's stronger. It's a very common feeling.\n\nGrowing from zero while staying anonymous is a specific challenge, but it's 100% doable. It just means you have to be more strategic.\n\nSince you (the founder) are anonymous, your brand has to become the entire personality. Here’s a game plan.\n\n1. Optimize Your Profile to Be Your \"Face\"\nYour profile is now your entire first impression. Before you do anything else, make this solid.\n\nProfile Pic: Use a clean, clear logo. Don't use a personal photo or a generic stock image.\nUsername: Make it as close to your business name as possible.\n\nBio: This is your elevator pitch. It must be crystal clear. Use this structure:\nLine 1: What you do / Who you help. (e.g., \"Handcrafted ceramic mugs for cozy mornings.\")\nLine 2: The value you provide. (e.g., \"Daily inspiration • Pottery tips • Shop our drops\")\nLine 3: A Call to Action (CTA). (e.g., \"👇 Shop the new collection\")\nLink in Bio: This should go to your website (once it's ready). For now, you can use a free Linktree/Stan/etc., but a direct website link is always more professional.\n\n2. The \"Cold Start\" Growth Strategy (Getting 0 -&gt; 100)\nYou have no friends/family to tap, so you have to find your first followers \"in the wild.\"\n\nDO NOT: Follow 1,000 random people hoping they follow back. This gets you low-quality followers and can look spammy.\n\nDO THIS INSTEAD (The 10/10/10 Method):\nFind 10 \"competitor\" or \"shoulder\" accounts. These are accounts where your ideal customer already hangs out.\nGo to their most recent posts.\nLeave 10 genuine, thoughtful comments. This is the key. Don't just post \"Nice!\" or a fire emoji. Add to the conversation. If it's a potter, say, \"That's a beautiful glaze technique! Does it work well on stoneware?\"\n\nPeople will see your insightful comment, see your (now optimized) logo/name, get curious, click your profile, and—if your bio is clear and your content is good—they will follow.\n\nThis is the single best way to get your first 100 relevant followers who actually care about what you do\n\n3. Your Content Strategy (Faceless &amp; Valuable)\nYou need to give people a reason to follow you. Your content must provide value. Every post should either Educate, Entertain, or Inspire.\n\nReels are Your #1 Growth Tool: The algorithm pushes Reels to non-followers. This will be your main discovery engine.\n\nFaceless Reel Ideas:\nShow your product in use (a hand holding the mug, not your face).\nShow the process (packing an order, designing on your computer, sketching an idea).\n\nUse text-on-screen with a trending audio to share a quick tip.\nUse high-quality, aesthetic stock video clips (from Pexels or Canva) and add your tips/info as text overlays.\nCarousels are Your #1 Nurture Tool: These are great for your existing followers.\n\nUse them for tutorials, step-by-step guides, myth-busting, or sharing a list of resources. These get a lot of saves, which the algorithm loves.\n\nUse Canva: You can create 90% of your graphics and simple video content in Canva. It's all you need to look professional without being a graphic designer.\n\n4. How to Be Found (Hashtags)\nHashtags are how you tell Instagram what your post is about. Don't use massive tags like #business (100M+ posts). You'll be invisible.\n\nUse a \"niche-down\" strategy. In each post, use a mix of 10-15 tags:\n\nBroad (3-5): #[your_industry] (e.g., #pottery)\nNiche (5-7): #[your_specific_product] (e.g., #handmademugs, #ceramicart)\nCommunity (3-5): #[your_target_audience] (e.g., #pottersofinstagram, #coffeelovers)\n\nThe biggest thing is consistency. It's a marathon. You're starting on \"hard mode,\" which is slower, but it's so much more rewarding. You'll know that every single follower and sale was 100% earned by your own effort and the quality of your brand.\n\nYou've got this. Good luck.",

I'm also in the US, but wouldn't presume it works too differently there, but consult an accountant and see. I'd imagine that it's mostly a wash and putting back in money you've been paid isn't going to have major negative repercussions in most tax situations.\n\nThe flip side is the risk (again, speaking from another country experience, but wouldn't assume the basics are that variable). Money in the company bank account is more vulnerable than money in your own account, assuming that you didn't bend or break any rules in getting it there.",

It builds good habits.\n* Reevaluate every 3 months. If your revenue stays steady, slowly bump it up.\n\nYou don’t need to wait until you go full-time, if you start small now it can help the transition later!\n\nHope this helps!",

So you pay tax on the net income whether it’s in your business account or not.\n\nI keep a small reserve amount in my business account, use a credit card for all expenses (paid with biz acct) the rest goes into Betterment savings. Now I do pay myself since it’s my full-time gig, but anything above what I actually need gets tossed into Betterment. I do my books monthly so I know roughly what I’ll owe in income tax, so that plus “profit” and working capital—into Betterment. \n\nWhy? For a while they were paying over 4% APY, now they’ve dropped it to 3.75%. There are other high yield options out there I’m sure. I do this for rental properties as well. I used to keep 3 months’ worth of expenses in each property account, but I learned it was passing through anyways. So enough for mortgage-taxes-insurance and about $1,500 extra in case I need access quickly. I also use credit to pay for materials, utilities, etc. Anything more is usually planned ahead of time or at least enough time for the ACH transfer to go through. \n\nThat way whether the money is going to get used, saved for taxes, or saved for major expenses, it’s earning at least something. \n\nWe also set our household up this way, too. Paychecks come in, transfer money for fixed monthly expenses into a monthly expenses checking account, a few bucks in personal checking, rest into savings.",
