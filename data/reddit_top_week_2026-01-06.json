      "selftext": "I've been flipping electronics (mostly Gaming PCs) and other items (random vintage stuff) as a side hustle for about 5 years now. Started at thrift stores, garage sales, then moved to online sourcing from Facebook Marketplace, OfferUp, etc.\n\n**The Problem That Was Killing My Efficiency:**\n\nThe actual sourcing part was taking FOREVER. For every item I'd consider buying:\n\n* Take photo or screenshot\n* Google Lens it to identify what it is\n* Search eBay sold listings manually as a makeshift eBay price checker\n* Calculate fees (eBay takes 13.25%, PayPal another cut, shipping costs)\n* Figure out actual profit margin\n* Decide if it's worth my time\n* Add to my tracking spreadsheet if I bought it\n\nThis process took 5-10 minutes per item. When you're looking at 50+ items a day, that's 4+ hours just doing research trying to answer \"what is this worth\" and \"how much can I sell this for.\"\n\n**What I Learned After 5 Years:**\n\nThe difference between profitable flippers and people who quit is speed of decision-making. You need to know instantly:\n\n* Is this worth buying?\n* What's my actual profit after all fees?\n* How fast will it sell?\n* Any red flags I should check?\n\n**My Solution (After Trying Everything):**\n\nI tried various reseller tools:\n\n* ChatGPT (too generic, doesn't know current prices)\n* Google Lens (identifies item but no profit analysis)\n* Manual eBay research (too slow)\n* Various paid tools (either too expensive or missing key features)\n\nNone of them did the full workflow for retail arbitrage, so I spent 6 months building my own reseller app that works as a complete deal finder app and thrift store price checker app:\n\n* Identifies the item from a photo (brand, model, year, condition)\n* Pulls real eBay sold prices (not asking prices - actual sales)\n* Calculates net profit after ALL fees with a built-in profit calculator for resellers (platform fees, payment processing, shipping)\n* Gives a deal score (0-100) so I know instantly if it's a good deal to flip\n* Flags red flags (common fakes, damage to check for, authentication tips)\n* Tracks everything in one place (what I paid, where I sourced it, sale price, actual ROI)\n\nTakes 15-30 seconds per analysis instead of 5-10 minutes. It's basically become the best app for resellers in my workflow because it answers \"is this worth buying\" instantly.\n\n**Real Example:**\n\nFound a Canon camera lens at a thrift store for $45. Took a photo:\n\n* Item identified: Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM lens\n* eBay sold median: $98\n* After fees &amp; shipping: $73 net to me\n* Profit: $28 (62% ROI)\n* Deal score: 78/100 (GOOD)\n* Days to sell: 7-14 days typically\n* Red flags: Check for lens fungus, test autofocus\n* Best platform: eBay\n\nTotal time: 20 seconds. I bought it, sold it 9 days later for $95, netted $27 after everything. Analysis was spot-on.\n\n**The ROI on This Approach:**\n\nBefore automation:\n\n* Research time: 4+ hours/day\n* Items analyzed: 50-60/day\n* Items bought: 5-8/day (lots of bad decisions from rushed research)\n* Average profit per flip: $18\n* Monthly profit: \\~$2,000\n\nAfter automation with my reselling app:\n\n* Research time: 45 minutes/day\n* Items analyzed: 80-100/day (faster = more opportunities)\n* Items bought: 12-15/day (better decisions = higher hit rate)\n* Average profit per flip: $24 (avoiding duds)\n* Monthly profit: \\~$4,300\n\nThe 3+ hours I save daily let me either source more or actually have free time.\n\n**Key Insights for Anyone Doing This Side Hustle:**\n\n**Speed matters more than perfection** \\- If you spend 10 minutes researching a $15 profit item, you just made $90/hour. Not bad, but you could analyze 6 items in that time and find a $50 profit item instead. This is why having a thrift store app that works like a retail arbitrage scanner app is crucial for making money flipping.\n\n**Know your fees cold** \\- eBay: 13.25% + $0.30. PayPal/Managed Payments: 2.9% + $0.30. Shipping varies. Factor ALL of this in with a reseller profit margin calculator or you're fooling yourself on profit.\n\n**Sold prices, not asking prices** \\- I don't care if someone is asking $200. I care what it actually sold for recently using a comparable sales finder. Huge difference.\n\n**ROI &gt; Profit sometimes** \\- A $10 item that flips for $40 (300% ROI) in 3 days is often better than a $50 item that flips for $90 (80% ROI) in 60 days. Your money is tied up. A good thrift haul profit calculator helps you understand this.\n\n**Platform matters** \\- Some items sell better on Poshmark (great Poshmark seller tools exist now), others on eBay, Mercari, or Facebook Marketplace. Knowing which platform to use with a Facebook Marketplace listing analyzer saves time and fees.\n\n**Track everything** \\- I log every single flip: source, cost, fees, sale price, days to sell. This data tells me which categories are most profitable and where to focus my time. Essential for understanding how much profit can I make flipping different categories.\n\n**Common Mistakes I Made (So You Don't Have To):**\n\n❌ Buying items because \"it seems valuable\" without checking actual sold prices (no flipping app to verify)   \n❌ Forgetting to factor in shipping costs (kills your margin fast)   \n❌ Not checking for fakes (lost $200 on a \"Nike\" jacket once - now I use authentication tips)   \n❌ Listing on wrong platform (eBay fees ate my profit when Facebook Marketplace would've been free)   \n❌ Not tracking my flips (couldn't tell which categories were actually profitable)\n\n**Results After Systematizing Everything:**\n\n* Monthly revenue: $4,500-7,000\n* Monthly profit: $2,000-3,000\n* Time invested: \\~20-30 hours/week when I'm off work (real side hustle app potential)\n* Best month: $7,200 profit (holiday season + few very lucky finds at thrift store)\n\n**Is This Actually Scalable?**\n\nYes and no. You're limited by:\n\n* Time to source (finding deals)\n* Time to list (photos, descriptions, shipping)\n* Storage space (inventory)\n* Cash flow (buying inventory)\n\nI've maxed out around $3k/month profit working 20 hours/week solo. To scale past that, you'd need to hire help or transition to wholesale/arbitrage models.\n\nFor a side hustle though? This beats most gig work. $2-3k/month for 20 hours/week doing thrift flips with the right reseller tools.\n\n**The Unglamorous Truth:**\n\nThis isn't passive income. You're trading time for money, just at a better rate than most side hustles. It's:\n\n* Driving to thrift stores\n* Scrolling Facebook Marketplace at 6am when new stuff drops (having a Facebook Marketplace app helps)\n* Taking photos and writing listings\n* Packaging and shipping\n* Dealing with buyer questions and returns\n\nBut it's flexible (work whenever), low barrier to entry (start with $100), and actually profitable if you're systematic about it.\n\n**Questions I Always Get:**\n\n**Q: What items should I flip?** A: Start with what you know. I do electronics because I can spot deals and know common issues. Others do clothing, shoes, collectibles, books. Knowledge = edge. Learning what to flip from thrift stores and understanding the best items to resell from garage sales takes time. Using a price checker app speeds up the learning curve dramatically. Many people ask about goodwill finds worth money - electronics, vintage items, and brand-name goods are solid bets.\n\n**Q: How much money do I need to start?** A: I started with $100. Buy a few items, sell them, reinvest. You'll be cash-flow limited at first but it builds.\n\n**Q: Where do you source?** A: Thrift stores (Goodwill, Value Village), garage sales, estate sales, Facebook Marketplace, OfferUp, Craigslist. Online sourcing is huge now. Having an app to check eBay prices and a Mercari price checker helps when sourcing online.\n\n**Q: What about returns/scams?** A: Happens. eBay heavily favors buyers. Budget 5-10% loss rate from returns, damaged in shipping, or occasional scam. It's part of the business.\n\n**Q: Is the market saturated?** A: Some categories yes (iPhones, popular sneakers). But there are thousands of niches. I focus on Gaming PCs + older electronics that most people don't know the value of. That's where a vintage value checker app really shines - helping you identify hidden gems.\n\n**Q: How do you handle taxes?** A: Track everything. Mileage, purchases, fees, shipping supplies - all deductible. I use my app's in-built inventory tracker + reports. Made $52k revenue last year, profit was $48k after costs, actual taxable income was \\~$42k after deductions. Pay quarterly estimated taxes.\n\n**Bottom Line:**\n\nIf you're looking for a side hustle that:\n\n* Can start with &lt; $100\n* Has legitimate $2-4k/month potential\n* Doesn't require special skills (just learning how to know if something is worth flipping)\n* Gives you flexibility\n\nFlipping/reselling is legit. But you need to be systematic, fast, and data-driven with the right reseller tools. The people making money aren't guessing - they use tools like an AI price checker for resellers to know their numbers cold.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone's interested in trying this or wants to know more about specific aspects (sourcing strategies, platform differences, automation tips, etc.)",

I'd like to find a sidehustle that I can do on my personal computer in the down times. I already do some data annotation, but the burn out on that is getting pretty high. Here are the requirements/info about my skill set:\n\n  \n1. Must be accomplishable while staying at my desk. \n\n2. Must be something I can set to the side if I am called to work on something at my own job(ie no set hours or blocking out large portions of time).\n\n3. Must be something that I can do making \\~$15 or more an hour.\n\n4. I know some programming(mostly SQL with some Python, R, etc). I am also familiar with AWS products.\n\n5. I do photography for fun, and I am experienced in photo editing. \n\n6. I'm tech savvy and quick to learn things. I actually began my data career by getting a job that required I know SQL and learning it on the fly. \n\n  \nAnything to point me in the right direction would be much appreciated. Thanks! ",

It’s not programming, but it’s also not mindless. You have to follow complex guidelines, make judgment calls, and stay consistent over time.\n\nThere *is* a learning curve. Most people drop out early because they treat it like quick gig work. The ones who stick around learn how to work predictably and end up with better access and higher-paying projects.\n\nIt’s not creative in the artistic sense, but it’s analytical and structured.

It’s not AS hard as other people make it seem like, and I’ve been in the space for a while so I know how to navigate supplier sites, how to set up storefronts and what not. I’ve ran 2 dropshipping sites before this, and it’s in the product more than anything. One did nothing, then the other one did like 20 sales, but my margins were so low that it wasn’t really worth it. If you get the right product and market it right you’ll make money either way.

This way you don't have to worry about promoting your products, you just have to worry about making sure that you have product in stock to sell and ship out quickly. Trying to do ecommerce on your own is harder, because people don't just trust any new website that is selling products. Think of it like this, would you buy a pizza from Pizza Hut or from some guy selling out of his house?",

      "selftext": "Roughly 12 months ago I traveled to Asia (Japan and China) for just over two weeks. I had an incredible time and an epiphany I wasn’t expecting. \n\nThis is the most time I have consecutively taken away from work, fully focused on fun and relaxing. I work in sales, six figure deals, grueling hours, but I find it for the most part fulfilling. \n\nWe flew from Japan to China to see my partners family, flight from Tokyo to Shanghai, and then a 3 hour drive. This left me with a ton of time to reflect on the trip so far and also the trip to come. I felt completely overwhelmed by the idea that I want to be able to do this more. I started thinking about ways to make passive income to pay for a trip like this again, but in reality money wasn’t as much of the issue as time was. \n\nI have a job that doesn’t allow me to work remote nor would it be a good idea for me to negotiate a hybrid or remote position at my current company. My job is reliant on being in front of the consumer. So I pivoted and started thinking about what I could possibly do at the same time as my day job, with minimal risk.\n\nAfter traveling in China and returning home with a huge inspiration to break out of my predictable life and really try something new I began brainstorming. I thought about all of the things that I saw in Asia that I didn’t see in the US.\n\nAfter a lot of time compiling ideas I remembered these charging kiosk that were everywhere in China. Scan a QR, portable charger pops out, plug your device in and carry on. We used these a few times when we needed a boost and it was so easy.\n\nInitially I began looking at sourcing a kiosk like I saw from a Chinese company, but that idea faded after confusing product descriptions and huge shipping costs. \n\nI know this exists to an extent in the US, I have seen versions of this product at malls, stadiums, and a few restaurants. Most of these required an individual sign up, leaving your phone at the kiosk, or no where to return it.\n\nI found a US company that created a product that I felt was closest to what I experienced in China. I scheduled a call with a rep to learn more and I was impressed. The rep answered a lot of questions and encouraged me to “act fast” as this was around the time that the tariffs were being introduced.\n\nI bought 10 kiosks that house 10 portable power banks available for rent. \n\nI live in New York City, a place I believe could hugely benefit from an integrated portable phone charging infrastructure. In my head this was like the “Citi bike” of phone charging. \n\nUpon receiving my 10 kiosks I started my outreach to businesses. Again, I currently work in sales so I assumed this was the easy part. I had a pipeline full of leads, I made an excel tracker to monitor my business and I was off to the races.\n\nI sent probably 500 emails and got one reply which I later found out was an AI assistant lmfao. I continued the email outreach but changed my template and introduced some A B testing. I added cold calls to the equation…\n\nIf you have never called a business in Manhattan and tried to pitch something, let me tell you… character building. Anyways I had no luck. So I also incorporated messaging on social media, which surprisingly got the most traction.\n\nHere is the question:\n\nMy rep told me that If I at any point wanted to return the chargers he would buy them back from me.\n\nSo after almost 12 months of trying to make this work should I call it quits? Or am I not trying hard enough?\n\nI certainly assumed this would be easier and that my sales background would make it almost a cake walk but I have been humbled.\n\nI have more ideas on gaining traction in the new year but at the same time I am so sick of failing. \n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nI have been a passive income enthusiast since high school and one of my favorite forms of passive income has been through bandwidth sharing apps.\n\nI started using them because I loved the idea of being able to make money by just leaving my computer running. It was amazing to check on the earnings at the end of each month and realize that I made money doing almost nothing.\n\nOver the years bandwidth sharing apps have become more popular and there have been a lot of different apps launched. I have experimented with several of them and know how hard it is to find the bandwidth sharing apps that \"work\".\n\nSome are fake and will never payout. Others are dangerous and can infect your device. I have learned the hard way how to vet these services and now I launched a website to help people find the best bandwidth sharing apps.\n\n[ShareData.app](http://ShareData.app) is a directory of bandwidth sharing apps classified by reliability. I launched this app out of my dorm room with a few friends who are also passionate about passive income.\n\nEvery month we update the classification based on three criteria:\n\n1. Financial Return\n2. Payout Reliability &amp; App Consistency\n3. Safety, Security, &amp; Risk Mitigation\n\nThe goal is to help find the bandwidth sharing app that pay their users and do not harm your system or use your bandwidth to access any troublesome sites.\n\n**We do not accept any sponsorships nor do we use any advertisements.**\n\nNew bandwidth sharing apps cannot use our platform to advertise themselves and our ranking is based solely on the performance of the bandwidth sharing app.\n\nWe are hoping this community benefits from this directory and welcome any feedback you have about the website!",

      "selftext": "So I have a small YouTube channel about home organization and decluttering, been doing it since like March last year. Making around $400-500 from adsense depending on the month, plus maybe another $150-200 from affiliate stuff. Not huge but pays for groceries.\n\nLike I did a video about organizing under the sink and it got 80k views, that one probably made me $200. But most videos get like 5-10k views.\n\nProblem is I spend like 10-15 hours a week filming and editing and im kinda burned out. My wife keeps saying I should post the same content on tiktok and instagram. She sends me tiktoks of other organization accounts like \"see they're making money, you should do this.\" Shes probably right but I really dont want to film everything twice. Also my youtube videos are like 12-15 minutes and nobody watches that on tiktok.\n\nBeen trying to repurpose content for the past 2 months and its kinda working but also kinda a mess. My workflow is all over the place. Sometimes I use Descript to pull clips, sometimes I just do it manually in CapCut cause Descript crashes a lot. Sometimes I use those AI avatar things for videos where I dont want my face, tried a couple like APOB and HeyGen but not sure if people think its weird. Sometimes I just use stock footage with my voiceover.\n\nSo far after 2 months:\n\n* TikTok: posted maybe 30 videos, got around 2k followers somehow, made like $45 from affiliate links\n* Instagram: posted 25 reels, got maybe 700-800 followers, made $30\n* YouTube Shorts: posted 20, complete waste of time, best one got 400 views\n\nThe annoying part is I still dont know what actually works. Some of my avatar videos do ok on tiktok, some flop completely. My real face videos are hit or miss too. Algorithm makes no sense.\n\nAlso im spending like 5 hours a week just repurposing stuff which defeats the whole purpose of trying to save time. Like yesterday I spent 3 hours trying to export a video and CapCut kept freezing. Almost gave up.\n\nFunny thing is my wife started posting the same content on her own account just using her phone and shes already at 5k followers in like 6 weeks. Meanwhile im here spending hours with all these tools making $45 a month on tiktok. She keeps laughing at me.\n\nNot sure if I should keep doing this or just focus on YouTube and forget the other platforms. Anyone else deal with this?",

Don't forget to make catchy and eye catching thumbnails that are on point. Make sure video intros are good highlighting the video in someway that attention grabbing.

      "selftext": "I've been lurking on this sub for a few months now and it genuinely changed how I think about making money on the side. I started out looking for quick ways to make extra cash and ended up building something way more sustainable than I expected. Now I'm sitting at around $1000/month from mainly 2 streams, so I'll share what worked:\n\nThe Main Thing : Canva Creator Program ($600-800/month)  \nI've been uploading FB and IG ad templates to Canva since earlier this year and it's turned into legit royalty income. The cool thing is I don't need to keep uploading to maintain the cashflow, it just compounds over time. All those elements and templates you see in Canva are made by individual creators and we get paid a small percentage based on how much they're used by Pro subscribers. Since I started earlier this year I've been seeing consistent growth month over month.  \nMy process is super simple. I use Meta's Ad Library to see what's working in paid ads right now. You can filter by industry, see what formats are popular, and basically get a masterclass in what converts. Then I take that inspiration and add my own twist to it. Sometimes it's color schemes, sometimes it's layout variations, but the core structure is based on what's already proven to work. I mostly upload ad templates, gradients, and design elements. A lot of it is stuff I make while warming up before actual client work or things I created for projects but didn't sell the IP to.\n\nThe Background Stuff - GPT Apps ($100-200/month)\\[I know it's been said 100 times on the sub alr\\]  \nI saw a post on this sub a few days back about someone using their spare time to do GPT apps and it reminded me that this is something I've been doing too. I replaced my scrolling time with these apps. Like instead of mindlessly going through Instagram or Twitter for 20 minutes, I'll open one of these apps and do surveys or game offers.\n\nI'm pulling around $100-200/month from a mix of survey platforms and game reward apps. Some months are better than others depending on what's available, but it averages out to that range.  \nThe biggest shift for me was understanding the difference between trading time for money and building assets that pay you repeatedly. The Canva stuff is asset building. I make a template once and it earns for years. The reward apps are time trading, but low effort time that I'd waste anyway. If you're just starting out, don't sleep on things that seem small or beneath you. I almost didn't start with reward apps because I thought it was kind of lame. But even $100 is real money and it required basically zero skill to start.  \nAnd if you have any creative skills at all, seriously look into Canva's creator program. The Meta Ad Library trick alone is worth trying, even if you're not uploading to Canva. It's free market research. Anyway, this sub planted a lot of these seeds for me so figured I'd give back.",

Freelancing or small service businesses online, like basic SEO cleanups, customer support, or simple video edits, still pay if you get a couple steady clients. Marketplaces are noisy and you’ll see a lot of ghost jobs and recruiter spam, so build a tiny portfolio and pitch directly. If you just need something steady while you ramp up, wf​haler​t is a simple service that emails vetted remote jobs like data entry or admin work, less junk to wade through.

Microtasks are rarely worth the effort beyond pocket change. AI tools are powerful, but mostly as an accelerator, not a business by themselves.\n\nPersonally, I think digital products have the biggest long-term potential right now. You can build something once, improve it over time, and sell it repeatedly. No clients, no constant meetings, and it scales much better than hourly work. The key is keeping it simple and actually useful — guides, templates, systems, things that save people time or confusion.\n\nThere’s no magic shortcut, but combining real skills with digital products and a simple distribution strategy has been one of the most sustainable models I’ve seen.",

What flopped was KDP low content, I got crushed by competition, and I’d never touch dropshipping again because of returns and payment holds.

          "body": "Coming from corporate finance you should actually have a really good leg-up in that you understand money better than the average Joe.\n\nMy main strategy is grid-trading. Without going into too much detail I focus on a top 20 crypto that  has pretty much stayed in the $12-30 range for the last few years. I have a bot that simply automates sales orders every time the price fluctuates 1.5%. This isn’t enough to replace my day job when you average out the good &amp; bad periods and even if it was I’d probably just divert that income to other investments for the time being but it’s enough that if I suddenly got laid off it would cover my bare minimum under realistic but bad conditions and potentially exceed my day job during short periods of high volatility.\n\nExtremely low effort and surprisingly high ROI but there is a fair amount of fluctuation due to the market plus the risk that it could all go to zero. Also a reasonable but respectable amount of capital is involved (think a year’s worth of salary).\n\n\n\n\nA shocking percent of people in the investing space have very little knowledge of accounting, forecasting, understanding financial ratios, hedging, etc so you could possibly create content to address that gap and get better returns by using “sweat equity” instead of cash to get the ball rolling.\n\nAt the end of the day though you have a few factors you gotta balance: time, capital, risk, and required returns. You can make a ton of money with little risk and little effort if you have a lot of money to start with,  can make a lot of money with little upfront effort if you are willing to lose it all, you can put in a ton of time and build something that will reward you down the road, etc.\n\n\nThere is no such thing as a free lunch so you gotta tweak the inputs to get where you are comfortable but passive income isn’t a myth but you do gotta temper expectations. It’s unrealistic to think that you can replace your day job with zero effort and $1k. But depending on how much effort &amp; capital you are willing to invest you can build a nice revenue stream.",

My father passed away, and I currently don't have a job, and I now live in his apartment. I'm 22, and I don't have a high school diploma. I've tried looking for jobs, but I haven't been getting any callbacks, and everything is very spread out where I live and hard to get to on foot, we also don't have public transportation. Unfortunately, I also think I'm being a bit picky with the jobs I'm wanting but I have mental issues that make interacting with people pretty complicated. I've been looking for remote jobs, too, but im not sure where else to look. So now I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I'm a digital artist, and I crochet. I've tried to make money off of them, but it never seems to stick. Hopefully, someone here can at least point me in the right direction.\n\nEdit: Hi! I really appreciate all the comments people have been leaving and that this is being seen. I just wanna clear up a couple of things really quickly. I've seen a lot of people mention getting my GED, I was in the process of that before my dad passed because he could drive me. But I can't drive, so I have no way to get there. I've looked online for any free GED programs, but as far as I can tell, there aren't any. Maybe this isn't the right sub to be posting on. I'm not sure. But again, thank you for commenting. I'm gonna keep looking for jobs and other things!",

I was not trying to build a big brand, just something simple that could run quietly on its own.\n\nHere’s what i did:\n\n* Choose custom ceramic mugs and a few small customizable accessories like key chains and desk items. They are affordable and work well as gifts also people tend to reorder. It also felt like a good option for anyone who wants to start something new without going all in.\n* Used a product designing tool in which I wrote a simple product description and it generated a basic tech pack I could send to manufacturers. That made it much easier to explain sizes, materials, print areas and finish without confusion or multiple revisions.\n* Build everything through Instagram. No ads at the start. I treated it like a small shop and did clear product posts with pinned pricing, highlights answering common questions and real reviews.\n\nOnce I saw repeat questions and orders I simplified everything. Fixed mug sizes, limited options, saved replies and a clear order flow. Now it stopped feeling like daily work and takes very little time to maintain. Orders still come from posts I made months ago. It is not fully passive but gives low stress and actual profit.\n\nHave you started a business this year or are you planning to start one next year? Share experiences and thoughts.\n\n",

The one that is relatively low effort/bordering on passive: Social media pages (mostly Facebook, but starting to spread out).    \n   \nI started a Facebook page over the summer with the intent to monetize it. It finally happened about 2 weeks ago. The money isn't great yet (~$200/mo), and I definitely made some mistakes that are impacting that, but I'm learning and there's a pretty clear path to scale the money. I think it could be \"good enough\" income for me within the span of a month, and full-time job replacement income within 6 months. I'm able to spend part of an afternoon making and queuing up posts once every two weeks. So not fully passive, but pretty low effort.   \n    \nAnd that's just from content monetization (i.e. just getting paid to post). No affiliate marketing, no selling anything (although I'm working on print on demand stuff), no brand deals. I would like to sell my own merch, but the rest of the stuff I don't want to deal with, and shilling someone else's stuff doesn't really mesh with what I've made.    \n    \nI'm trying to settle on what my true attempt #2 is going to be, but I have a basic framework mostly narrowed down.",

      "selftext": "Hi reddit, so in the last three months I've made a little over $1200 using ( what I think ) is a simple workflow I've built. Let me explain\n\nI'm junior account &amp;  just want to make some extra money for Christmas, I already had this workflow built but just for financial news. Its connected to Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok &amp; various other news outlets &amp; social media platforms. Then it alerts me of new stories before they hit the big platforms.\n\nThree months ago I started using my workflow to take trades on polymarket, thus this post. Its been fruitful so far. I get alerts on underreported news &amp; place trades on outcomes before the market reacted &amp; that's about it. Its not a sure fire method in the slightest, nor is it something super lucrative, &amp; it is risky as I often have to filter out fake news but it has been helpful as far as side hustles go.\n\nNow, I'm sure some of you are aware that this isn't exactly passive but I will be using this month to fix that issue. I'm currently working on making the workflow place the trades for me as well. Once this is done &amp; tested, I'll share an update.\n\nWhat i really wanted to share with you guys is that you should overlook the simple things, you never know, a simple system you use could be a money maker under different circumstances.\n\nAlso I apologize if this is super short, I really dont know how to explain, but feel free to ask questions &amp; ill try to answer as much as possible.",

So my only advice: pick something you really enjoy out of them and stick to it the most. If you put all your time in to so many other side hustles you’ll never get there. Put most of your time in to one you really enjoy and you’ll get there. And it’s not a sprint: you won’t make it in a day or week. People take months and even years before seeing a profit. So if you’re not in it for the long haul and growth then get a real job, finish school, and mature some then try. Not saying you’re too young, but if you don’t have discipline and patience you won’t succeed. Or at least from the people I’ve seen with those mentalities.",

It was a lecture for a college class, no one was mic-ed except the professor and he asked a lot of questions to the students. I had to determine the different students with only the audio, like if one answered more than 1 question i had to be able to recognize their voice. no video came with the audio. I submitted it several times and it was rejected for failing to properly identify speakers correctly, despite the otherwise accurate transcription of what was said. that was very frustrating.\n\nanother job involved a non-native english speaker with a strong accent.\n\nbasically, the starting jobs seemed to be the jobs the seasoned workers didn't want to touch. if i remember right, the more jobs submitted and the better the accuracy, the higher priority one could get for the easier to transcribe work.\n\nthe time required and the pay for that time wasn't really that good for someone like me, my typing average at the time was about 65wpm at 99% accuracy which i admit, isn't that impressive, basically the bare minimum needed for the jobs.\n\nif you are a fast and accurate typer, have good listening skills and hearing, it might be feasible if you stick with it. especially if you have and know how to use the foot pedal transcription things. you still might get work rejected however, sometimes for reasons that seem unfair or don't make sense. having a low rating at the beginning can prevent more work from becoming available.\n\njust my take on it, like i said, it was awhile ago and maybe they have changed. it is a legit company though. i did get paid. it was not easy and not much.",

          "body": "Some things to keep in mind, since the topic of time has been touched on. (Years) and consider what starting actually means. I intend to touch on the corners that I didn’t see explored much on these posts. \n\nI started out learning about running a business and started my own experimentally before i considered myself an entrepreneur. \n\nI started learning skills long before i considered myself an entrepreneur. I filed for my first llc etc; long before i needed to, and did a lot of derping around as do many of us. \n\nThe things I would say I learned that would have sped up the process was, consistency, in particular if your plan requires building and nurturing an audience. Also take advantage of Ai. Sure you can be successful without it, probably. But why make it harder on yourself? Be mindful of shiny object syndrome. The strength i already had was willingness and vision to pivot.\n\nI did make some money as a consultant as I’ve built out other things. I had a client who was previously a CFO and I learned a lot through that.\n\nLearn from whoever there is to learn from. Make sure they actually have success and know what they are talking about. Be very mindful of any partnerships or collaborations you make. \n\nTo bring another important perspective I haven’t seen much of on this thread, the people in your life have a huge impact on your success. So does self awareness. There’s a higher prevalence of things like narcissist personality disorder and adhd (me lol) in entrepreneurship, so self awareness and solid boundaries and genuine confidence are super important. Yes there are people who don’t have these who are successful, but it definitely makes it easier. You will learn all of these things the hard way if you don’t learn it with intention. \n\nBe mindful of bottle necks, and learn to take calculated risks. Those that are risk averse tend to be less likely to get to this level as well. \n\nYou are in control of your own time and life. You will find how much of the time we tend to spend doing busy work that doesn’t actually move the needle. Failure is feedback. That’s it. \n\nYour self care MATTERS. I have spent countless time living off of redbull and prayer. Learning balance gives you a clear head and the opportunity to make better decisions. \n\nWhatever you struggle with today and master tomorrow is an important opportunity. Especially if you struggled because you couldn’t find the thing you needed and had to create your own solution. Simple is almost always better.",

      "selftext": "Not sure if other app devs are seeing this, but wanted to share a shift we made recently that’s honestly been bigger for our growth than ASO or traditional SEO.\n\nA few months ago, we started getting feedback emails saying things like, *\"I asked ChatGPT for a cycling app that focuses on privacy\"* or *\"Gemini recommended you guys as a good Strava alternative.\"*\n\nIt happened enough times that we actually updated our onboarding survey. We added an \"AI/LLM Recommendation\" option to the \"How did you find us?\" question.\n\n**Two months later, nearly 30% of our new users were selecting that option.**\n\nWe realized that while we were fighting for keywords on the App Store, our actual users were just asking Claude or ChatGPT for specific recommendations. We’ve started calling it **LMO (Language Model Optimization)** internally. It’s definitely not mainstream yet, but here is exactly what we changed to make the AIs \"like\" us:\n\n**1. We started \"feeding\" the communities** We realized LLMs are basically scraping Reddit (r/cycling, r/bicycling), bike forums, and Quora for \"truth.\" So, instead of just posting on our own dev blog, we started heavily contributing in these communities. We noticed a direct correlation: the more we were mentioned in actual human conversations about \"alternatives to X\" or \"battery friendly apps,\" the more ChatGPT started recommending us.\n\n**2. We started writing content for robots, not just humans** We stopped with the flashy \"Ride Beyond Limits\" marketing slogans. LLMs love structure and literal facts. We updated our website and press kit to be super literal:\n\n* *Exactly what sensors we support (HRM, Cadence, Power)*\n* *Exactly how our battery usage compares to the big guys*\n* *Explicit statements on our privacy policy (No data selling)*\n\nWe basically gave the AI the \"context\" it needs to understand exactly where to file us in its database.\n\n**3. We planted \"memory seeds\"** We started posting content specifically designed to be indexed by these models.\n\n* Comparison tables on our blog (Us vs. The Big Competitors) regarding feature sets.\n* Documentation that links our app name with specific long-tail keywords like \"offline GPX export\" or \"commuter tracking.\"\n* Guest posts on cycling tech blogs that we know are in the training data.\n\n**4. We answered the questions people actually ask AI** We reverse-engineered what cyclists type into ChatGPT. Instead of targeting short keywords like \"bike app,\" we put exact match questions on our site:\n\n* *\"What is the best free cycling app without a subscription?\"*\n* *\"Which bike tracker drains the least battery?\"*\n* *\"How to track rides without sharing location data?\"*\n\nWhen you provide the direct answer to a direct question, the AI seems to prioritize your info as the \"correct\" answer.\n\n**The Result:** We stopped sweating over Google updates or App Store algorithms. Now, when you ask the major LLMs specifically about *\"Best privacy-focused bike tracker\"* or *\"Simple cycling apps for commuters,\"* we show up about half the time.\n\nWe’ve even had our team test this via VPNs and incognito windows to make sure it wasn't just personalized result and it holds up.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to dump this here in case it helps any other devs trying to figure out where their traffic is coming from. Happy to share the actual content calendar framework we use if people are interested in a Part 2.",

      "selftext": "I’m posting this because I keep seeing people online claiming they’re making money with AI, side hustles, tools, prompts, whatever. I tried. Properly. And it went nowhere.\n\nThis wasn’t “get rich quick”. I was aiming for a very modest amount per month. Something realistic. I’ve worked in large organisations for years, so I approached it like a real project, not hype.\n\nHere’s what actually happened.\n\nFirst I tried starting a blog (WordPress). That alone took way more time than expected. Setup, themes, plugins, decisions everywhere. No clear design. And the chatbot had absolutely NO CLUE about how to create and build a wordpress blog, even though it constantly told me how to do it, only to find that that was impossible then kept blaming Wordpress for changing its UI.  SO annoying.\n\nThen I spent several weeks building a Ghost blog site. The idea was AI would surface rumours and I’d investigate or debunk them. This fell apart completely. AI could not provide *any* reliable sources for any rumour it generated (and it generated A LOT!) Since provenance was the whole point, the project was dead. If I couldn't prove there was a rumour, how could I disprove, reject or corrorobate it?\n\nIn parallel I put up 4 Fiverr gigs. Carefully written with AI leading the way on how to correctly create a gig for maximum exposure. Low prices. Clear scope. Weeks later, zero orders. Maybe something comes eventually, but there’s no sign yet that this works at all. OK, probably not directly attributable to AI, BUT - it was AI that led me down this rabbit hole...\n\nI also explored a bunch of other AI-related service ideas. Every single one sounded OK until I asked basic questions like:  \n\\-who is actually paying?\n\n\\-why would they pay someone who is basically cold calling them?\n\n\\-what work already exists?\n\n\\-what cost is being replaced?  \nOnce you force those answers, most ideas collapse pretty fast.\n\nCosts weren’t huge but they were real:  \nChatGPT Plus \\~$50  \nGhost blog \\~$20  \nPlus six weeks of focused time\n\nReturn so far: zero.\n\nWhat bothers me is how misleading the public narrative is. From what I can see, most people “making money with AI” fall into one of four categories:\n\n1. they already had an audience\n2. they’re selling to people who want to make money with AI\n3. they’d earn the money anyway and AI gets the credit\n4. they’re exaggerating or lying\n\nAI is useful. I still use it. But as a way for an individual to create *new* income from scratch? I just don’t see it.\n\nI am posting this because negative experiences don’t get shared much, and I suspect a lot of people are quietly finding the same thing and assuming they’re the problem.\n\nI don’t think I was.\n\nPostscript - and THIS is ironic.  I got the chatbot to write up exactly why you should not use AI in the way I wanted to generate a small income. But Reddit would not accept it because it was written by an AI!!  So even *criticising* AI monetisation using AI tools can get you blocked from the places where the warning would matter most!",

But there's not a lot of actionable real world content out there, it's mostly \"How to build a websites worth 25,000 with AI\" content that never actually shows you how to go from end-to-end, it just entails doing a couple prompts and then having a completely non-functional website that doesn't usually look very good.\n\nThen there's somebody like me who actually is a web designer, has 10+ years of experience in the industry, and is actively working at an agency. I use AI as part of my web design process from end to end, starting with strategy all the way to delivery. I never see any content talking about the way that I do it and how to actually use it for real client work.\n\nI've presented work that I have built and designed with AI to real clients, and they have loved it. These are not cheap projects; this is not $5K or $10K websites. These are $20K, $30K, $40K websites.\n\nI would love to create content around that to help educate people and fill that void because I go out and see that there's just no content, and all the content is trash, not actionable, and not actually presentable to real clients that are paying real money.

Then in October I had some personal stuff come up and I literally had to set boundaries. Started blocking out actual work hours, stopped responding to non urgent stuff after 6pm, and told clients upfront that I batch my communications twice a day.\n\nI was honestly scared theyd leave. But the opposite happened? My retention jumped to like 89% over the last 3 months. Clients seem happier, they respect the boundaries, and weirdly they value my input MORE now. I think because Im not constantly available Im forced to be more strategic with my responses instead of just reactive. Im working probably 15 hours less per week and somehow I've actually got some money set aside now which never happened before. Sometimes doing less is actually the move.",

None of your friends have become doctors, and hardly even nurses after two years.\n\nWhat do you mean you've always been an entrepreneur at heart? you just started your adult life.\n\nI don't want to give life advice, it's all about you and how you want to live your life.  If you really have entrepreneurial spirit this is most likely what you should explore. If you want to be a doctor as well, be an entrepreneurial doctor. Become a dentist and aim for a chain of dental clinics. Become a surgeon and instead of curing people fill up their boobs, or much easier, just spend your days injecting some tiny amounts of liquid into their lips and muscles for massive profits. You can be passionate about heart surgery yet invent a non existing procedure or device and make millions upon millions, and you can do that probably do similar in almost any medical specialty.\n\nNurses? overworked and probably underpaid. Doctors? mostly very busy, stressed, have no life, and probably therefore even if well paid are underpaid, since they have no life and are literally giving their life away to the job.\n\nYou quite simply need to decide what you want to be and how your want to live, and what kind of lifestyle you want in the future.\n\nSo what if your first business is failing or failed, or your second or third. If and when you make it, you could retire while watching your peers give their lives away for \"good pay\" and status, but literally having no life. However, you could also keep on failing forever, or at least not making it the way you want to and they took over in any way that you consider as a success, be it home ownership, an expensive car, a trophy wife, or whatever else people compare themselves with, with their peers.  None of that is a guarantee of any degree of happiness. In fact I guess most people are unhappy, frustrated or jealous in some shape or form.  Life and your choices are filled with risks, and you need to be able to live with your choices.\n\nYou are right to start thinking about this early, however, you need to always be vigilant and decide what is best for you, and what your path is, and be flexible at allowing yourself to make a change at any moment.\n\nTry to look far into the future, and think where you REALLY want to go.",

Here's one:\n\nDo not quit your job! At least not right up front. You made up your mind to quit and start a company. Fantastic. My advice is not to quit your job to pursue your company full time until the last possible moment. While you are still working (and getting paid!) spend six months or so in the evenings planning. Get a team together, do your research, build a business plan, go another level deeper and get all of the detail of product development and the company administration planned out.\n\nBuild as much of your company as possible while someone else is footing the bill for your survival. I can't tell you how many times I've had this discussion and when I say this the founder hangs their head a little. My response - you quit your job already, didn't you? Founding a successful company is hard enough without putting the (unnecessary) added pressure of having to worry about survival money on the first day. Even if you've saved, why not use a continuing salary from your current job to get going.\n\nMore in future posts. Hope this helps some.",

That's a huge milestone.\n\n\n\nFor the documentation/invoicing:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Quick wins:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Use Wave or FreshBooks (both have free tiers) - they generate professional invoices in 5 minutes. Include: invoice number, your business details, itemized breakdown of services, payment terms (Net 30 is standard for corporate), total.\n\n\n\n\\- For what you spent their money on: Create a simple expense report in Google Sheets. Columns: Date, Category (Software, Services, Marketing, etc.), Description, Amount. Attach receipts if you have them. Corporate clients love transparency.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The systems part:\\*\\*\n\nThey're not expecting enterprise-level operations from a 2-year-old service business. They're expecting:\n\n1. Clear communication about what you're doing\n\n2. Regular updates on progress \n\n3. Proper billing (see above)\n\n4. Basic contract/SOW for future work\n\n\n\nIf they're asking about \"systems,\" they probably mean: Do you track time? Do you have project management? Do you have a process? Simple answer: Yes, you use \\[insert Notion/Trello/Monday - even if you just set it up\\]. The important part is showing you're organized, not that you're using enterprise software.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Pro tip:\\*\\* After you send them the report, follow up in 2 days and ask if they need anything clarified. This shows you're professional and gives you a chance to address concerns before they become issues.",

Most contractors can receive it within 1-2 days.\n\nPayoneer works well too and some freelancers prefer it cause they can keep money in USD and withdraw locally when rates are good.\n\nReal talk though - just ask your contractors what they prefer. Some countries have better options than others. Like in Philippines, GCash or local banks might be easier. In India, direct bank transfer through Wise works great.\n\nSet a specific pay date (like 1st and 15th of month) and stick to it so you're not constantly managing who got paid. Automate reminders so you don't forget.\n\nThe 10% fees you're seeing are prob from using the wrong method. Switch to Wise or Payoneer and it drops to 1-3% depending on country.",

The logistics end up taking more time than the work itself.\n\nWhat helped me wasn’t finding a single “perfect” method, but standardizing the rules on my side. Same pay day for everyone, clear cutoff times, and no one-off exceptions. That alone reduced a lot of the mental load and back-and-forth.\n\nThe other big lesson was separating speed from cost. The fastest options were almost always the most expensive, and the cheapest ones required planning ahead. Once I accepted that tradeoff and planned payouts a few days earlier, things got way smoother.\n\nIt really shouldn’t be this hard, but right now the biggest win I’ve seen is reducing variability so you’re not constantly tracking who’s paid, who’s pending, and who’s stuck in limbo.

I just want to let you guys know that I like Entrepreneurship not for the money but the joy of building.

Because you can't learn what products to build, services to offer, how to sell, and market without understanding the world. \n\nYou don't have to be consumed by it - but you should not ignore it. \n\nPlus, you need to be able to relax. And have friends that have nothing to do with your business. \n\nYou won't see the benefit to that right now because you're in the honeymoon stage of your business, but eventually you will.",

Same cycle of idea → plan → build → see the result. Tangible output you can actually touch, which is satisfying in a way that software sometimes isn't.\n\nTeaching or mentoring. If you've been building things, passing that knowledge on can be weirdly fulfilling. You're still \"building\" something - just with people instead of products.\n\nOpen source contributions. If you're technical, you can build things on weekends that aren't tied to revenue pressure. The building is the point.\n\nThe key is finding things where progress is visible and measurable - that's what most builders are actually addicted to, not entrepreneurship itself.",

Gym, running, cooking, random skills, even stupid hobbies. Something where you’re not trying to optimise or win.\n\nAlso you’re probably not boring, you’re just stuck in builder mode all the time.

Actually I admire people who can be so passionate about anything. \nI really do think that if you want to get really good at something, you have to invest a majority of your time and energy into it &amp; of course it’s difficult to excel at something like entrepreneurship and then at the same time have several hobbies. \nI think it’s okay to have one thing that you are really good at and really care about, rather than being someone, who’s kinda good and kinda interested in many things, but in a way not extemely passionate about anything in patricular at all. \n\nIf you’re worried about being boring to other people, I think you should surround yourself with other entrepreneurially spirited people, you can connect over your passion. Same goes for dating, if you care about that: being with a person who shares your passion for whatever is the most amazing feeling. You can talk about them for hours about the specific thing you have a shared interest in. \n\nHowever, if it’s really causing you distress, that you feel like all you can think about is entrepreneurship, then to me it sounds like you’re in a bit of a burnout actually. \nMaybe you are overwhelmed and don’t actually have the mental capacity to care about anything at all. \nMaybe you could have a break where you get away from your routine for a while and try something new, like going to a pottery class, skiing, hiking - whatever it is that can take your mind off things and maybe reinvigorate you.\n\nFinding a new hobby, although this shouodn’t be the goal, will also help you achieve more in your entrepreneurial endavours because you’re able to switch your mind off and actually think more creatively again therefore be better at problem solving.\n\nPs: don’t listen to people calling you boring, you are not, rest assured!!",

So entrepreneurship seemed like the quickest way to spot something wrong and just go fix it myself.\n\nMy reasons for doing it changed over time. I kind of break it down into a few stages.\n\nFirst theres control like deciding what I work on and how I use my days. Back when I started that felt way more important than making money right away.\n\nThen leverage came into it building something once and watching it grow without starting over all the time every week or so.\n\nAnd meaning too working on stuff that Id still want to do even if nobody else cared or noticed.\n\nThe whole point for me isnt some huge exit or anything dramatic. Its more about having options being able to turn down things and pick projects because I want to not because I have to.\n\nTalking to other people who started businesses Ive noticed something. If the only reason is money or looking good it wears you out in that long boring stretch in the middle. But if its about being curious or having some freedom or scratching a real problem you can keep going longer without resenting it all.\n\nI wonder how others think about this.\n\nLike did your main reason shift after messing up the first time or getting a win.\n\nWhat are you aiming for in the end freedom or making a difference or something else specific.\n\nHonestly what keeps you showing up every day in this entrepreneurship thing.\n\nIt seems like we dont just pick it once most of us have to choose it again every year or so.

      "selftext": "My journey started out of necessity, not ambition. I was working at a truck repair shop when management kept making these insane decisions - one after another. Me and my coworkers eventually had enough and quit. At the time, I didn't realize I was about to become an entrepreneur.  \n  \nThe next few weeks were a blur. I was hustling just to keep the lights on - reselling stuff on eBay, fixing phone screens, building basic websites for friends. Whatever paid the bills. One night while I was down the reddit rabbit hole, I ended up on r/Entrepreneur and saw this post about someone crushing it with their cleaning company. I remember thinking 'why not? I could do that.' I’m writing this post hoping it inspires someone reading this as it did to me back then.   \n  \nStarting off was rough. I had no idea how to find cleaners, price jobs or even structure the business. The first website? Just a cookie-cutter theme that every other cleaning company was using. But it worked well enough to get us started. As we grew, I realized the website needed to be better - this wasn't just some placeholder anymore, it was an actual asset bringing in money. So I invested in a proper logo and custom site. We kept on growing but felt limited by leads we were getting as most of them were paid. The cost to acquire clients was high and we wanted to convert as many as we can - which presented its own challenges.  \n  \nThis prompted us to look at how to rank our website which took me on another trail I wasn’t ready to go down on. The first overseas team we worked with ranked us but for landing pages built on their website and for keywords no one was searching for! At that time I didn’t understand long tail keywords or much related to the art of sending signals to google. I soon moved on and tried my luck locally. We hired a local firm on a premium retainer basis and under a year-long contract to deliver us that sweet local organic traffic we hoped would result in bookings. A year later? Barely anything to show for it. Started investigating and found out the blog content I paid for was recycled from their other cleaning clients. The back-link strategy? Just a web of links between all their customers. I was beyond pissed when I figured it out.\n\n  \nAt that point, I'd been burned enough that I just started learning it myself. Optimized our Google Business Profile, rebuilt the website properly, created actual useful content and a bunch of other stuff - the agencies should've been doing way back. We started to see the organic leads increase month by month and stopped relying on paid leads eventually. It took years and cost me way more than it should have, but it was worth every headache to finally have this figured out. \n\n  \nPerhaps it's too soon to be writing this out here because it's only just the beginning but I wanted to connect with other entrepreneurs who've been on similar journeys. The road gets lonely sometimes, and hearing other people's stories - the wins, the failures, the pivot moments - that's what keeps me going.  \n  \nI’d love to read your stories about how you became or plan to become an entrepreneur. Cheers!",

      "selftext": "I started my business in April 2025, so officially less than 12 months. Started negative and used my credit card to fund the business.\n\nLittle back story about myself. I’m a carpenter by trade. Always been entrepreneurial and had an interest in business/making money. Didn’t come from money. Had a few small businesses over the years, some failed, others just weren’t viable. \n\n2025 started rough for myself. I experienced severe anxiety for the first time. Spent 2024 hustling and trading. Managed to build up an account to multiple 6 figs but got greedy and lost majority of it at the end of the year. Even lost my finances 10k that she trusted me with. I had to come clean and admit what I had done.. it was one of the hardest conversations of my life. \n\nThat leads me into the business, obviously having lost a significant amount of money, still had a job. I had to figure out ways to earn more to somehow get myself out of the hole I dug.\n\nSo I started doing a few cash jobs on the side, outside of work hours.\n\nInstalling basic shower screens, found work from apps where people posted jobs they needed done and I could quote/compete with others. \n\nAfter a few months of doing a few jobs a week. I could see there was profit to be made and the jobs had a quick turn over. 1 job in 45mins in some cases with profit of 50-60% \n\nSo I built a website with the help of AI, very basic, stock images and a few of images from\n\nI had done. Then I setup a Google ads campaign. Very basic, just let Google guide me. (I did have some previous experience with Google ads). \n\nWithin 10mins of the campaign being live. I had a form enquiry, I actually couldn’t believe it. Here I was laying in bed. I showed my fiancé and she brushed it off but I got excited, thinking if I can get a lead from $25 campaign.. imagine how many I can get if I increase my budget.\n\nWell the next day I increased to $50 a day.. and sure enough the leads increased. Here I was at work, phone ringing and emails coming through. Booking in as many jobs as I could. I could earn my weeks wage in a day - so I had to make a decision and speak to my fiance. Knowing I had a secure income, 150k a year and just lost a heap of money a few months prior. I didn’t expect her to support me, but she did.\n\nSo I took the leap. It was hard work, I was doing everything and sure enough had no idea how to run a business. Constantly learning, I had no idea what was involved and the amount of work behind the scenes. \n\nFast forward to now. I now have 2 employees. We are on track to do $1M revenue in the first year of business with 20% net profit. I still don’t have a factory, working out of the garage for as long as possible. \n\nThe goal is to expand to other states but first build the business and systems, test and ensure it’s a well oiled machine.

And did you start with stores then go online or vice versa?\n\nFor context, I run a B2B SaaS focused on retention analytics.

Retail is simply one of your distribution channels. I didn't think that was a common model anyway.\n\nCurious of the 30% you don't manufacture, why don't you? Where does it come from. Do you have any plans to import anything? I know you said you are generally low volume per design, but it seems like by manufacturing in-house, you have dangerously high labor expenses at US rates. And are spread across what is considered two entirely different business models. Manufacturing/ Retail. Do you think that's sustainable in a down turn?",

      "selftext": "At the start of 2025 I got into an online business model. For months I was just learning, watching videos, studying etc. I’ve always been better at talking than doing, but I really did understand the model inside and out.\n\nBy September I finally took the leap and it actually worked. Within two weeks I was earning, and in November I made over $20,000. For the first time I felt like \"oh damn im actually gonna make it\"\n\nBut then I messed up... I lost more than half of it because of a platform policy violation. Honestly, I could've avoided it but it is what it is.\n\nAround the same time, a guy I’d been talking to since February basically disappeared from my life. We had over 100k messages between us and talked every single day about this business. He started building a tool, I helped him, and we became partners. I genuinely thought we were building something together. Then he found loopholes in our contract and cut me out to work with someone else.\n\nSo within a few weeks, I lost a lot of money and someone I thought had my back.\n\nI’m 18 and still live with my parents. I pay my share of the bills and I have enough saved to get through 2026 without a job, so I’m not in danger or anything. But mentally, I’ve been stuck. I wake up around 1pm, watch YouTube, play games, tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve fixed a few small habits, but I just can’t get myself to actually work again.\n\nAt night it’s worse. I stay up until 3am because when I try to go to bed I either feel lonely or my brain won’t shut up. I do have a girlfriend, and honestly, all I want long term is to be able to provide for her one day. That’s what drives me deep down. But right now, I just feel like I lost my momentum and don’t know how to get it back.\n\nI’m not looking for hustle clichés or “just grind harder” advice. I’m just wondering how people get themselves moving again after losing money, trust, and confidence all at once.\n\n**TL;DR:** Built an online business at 18, made good money, lost most of it due to a mistake, then got cut out by a partner I trusted. Now I’m stuck, barely working, sleeping badly, and trying to figure out how to start again.",

Not because you need it or you're out of shape or anything, because it will help focus some of your energy, and I'm sure you got some angst built up. Put all that to good use and start lifting weights, do it for 90 days and see how you feel. \n\nIt won't really change anything, but I promise you will feel better. Cardio is good too, I just lift, it helps so much just a lift heavy, makes you feel really good afterwards. Do it everyday, because every day you will get a boost from it. Try to do it first thing in the morning, but just do it every single day even if it's not like a huge thing. I spend about 30 to 45 minutes in the gym everyday, it ain't life-changing, it's enough to boost me through the day. \n\nBetter than any drugs I ever tried.",

I made no income since all of the rent money from one home was being reinvested into the other, and once it seemed like things were going good, my tenants would stop paying. Since selling last year, I continued working in transportation with my CDL and am almost done with my BS in finance and accounting which I am finishing online. My entire net worth of $200k is mostly liquid, I own a few ETFs, a couple individual stocks, some Bitcoin, and my car. I have no debt, I max out my Roth every year, and my student aid will cover the rest of my degree which I'm finishing this December.\n\nMy problem is that I have no idea what I'm doing really. I don't want to drive a truck forever, and if the career I want to go into doesn't work out right away (personal finance), then I'll be driving this truck for who knows how many more years. I don't want to buy my own truck or start my own transportation business, and anyone who does is probably insane. I'm not wanting to become filthy rich, I just want to have fun and make enough money to pay my bills and take care of my family when the time comes for me to start one.\n\nJust interested to hear what you guys would do if you were me. I'm not sure if I'll take a huge plunge into something different right away, but I would love to shake things up this year. I am not happy in my career, and I'm willing to take a risk to change that and be my own boss. Just looking for some inspiration.\n\nThanks!",

You’ve already learned one of the hardest lessons early (landlording isn’t passive and tenant risk is very real), you have zero debt, real capital, a finance/accounting degree about to finish, and a high-income fallback skill that pays the bills while you experiment. That combo gives you something most people don’t: time and optionality. I wouldn’t rush into another capital-heavy business or try to “force” entrepreneurship right now. Instead, I’d keep the CDL as a safety net, tighten your investments into something boring and diversified, and start testing low-risk paths aligned with where you’re already leaning: personal finance content, fee-only advising later on, or even a small solo service like bookkeeping, tax prep, or financial coaching once you’re properly licensed. Those paths let you build credibility, income, and autonomy without lighting your capital on fire. You don’t need a huge plunge to change your life this year; you need controlled experiments while preserving your downside. You’re not lost, you’re just early, and you’ve earned the right to be patient while you build something you actually enjoy.",

If your goal isn’t to get super rich then there’s really no need for risking that capital to start a business at this time. Continue to focus on long term investments in the market, especially with ETFs. That money will compound in no time. I would also look into house hacking, you can get a traditional loan on a 1-4 unit residential property, live in one unit and rent out the others. You can essentially live for free while building equity in the house. Eventually you can move out and rent the other unit and turn a profit as well. Rinse and repeat and before you know it you own multiple properties increasing your net worth as the properties get paid down and increase in value. The main goal is to buy assets, especially ones that can cash flow. Whatever they may be, holding on to a lot of cash and just letting it sit is never good because it’s losing value. Get your degree, get a good job (with growth potential) and keep being responsible with your money. If you eventually wanna roll the dice on a business idea, go for it but it has to align with your goals. But remember, no 9-5 will be harder than starting your own business.

They rely on standards and routines that look the same day after day, whether it’s yours or someone else’s.\n\nFor the first couple of years, being a franchisee is significantly less stressful because the infrastructure is built and many questions are already answered. Starting as an independent, on the other hand, feels like going 80 with your hair on fire. Anything but boring.\n\nI personally prefer the latter because I value control. I’ve done both, and at 57 I’m better served by bringing my own answers to the bigger questions. In the end, the right choice hinges largely on experience and available cash.",

          "body": "Look, the honest truth is you're probably going to spend about the same amount of money either way. If you do it on your own, you're going to spend money in testing and trial and error, and things are more expensive because you don't have economies of scale. If you go the franchise route, you pay a bit more up front but the mistakes have already been made and the processes have been refined.\n\nThere's over 4,000 franchises in existence but less than 10% of them ever get over 25 locations. So the franchise that you partner with is extremely important and you need to make sure that it's well-established.\n\nOne of the more glaring red flags is a franchisor that hasn't learned how to be a franchisor yet. In that process you run the risk of their learning curve. By partnering with a more established franchise, there's repetition and time to improve or perfect the model. This is a much safer route in my experience.\n\nIf you're a self-starter and highly independent, you might be better off going on your own. But if you like mentorship, a coach, or a guide who can shorten your learning curve, franchises provide that. Either way you're going to pay. The biggest question is: do you want to pay for your learning curve or for someone else's? \n\nI'm a franchise consultant and I deal with established brands every day. If you want to talk it through or what to look for and how to interview a franchise company, let me know. I'm happy to help!",

We own the property and a nearby house that we rent out to staff at a substantially discounted rate **(€50 a week)**.\n\nMy father currently **does the work** of 3-4 employees. We don't have a floor manager; **it's** him who runs it. He also handles stock management every week, **alongside** the staff wages. He often wakes up at 6 am and doesn't get home until 10 pm, 6-7 days a week.\n\nTruthfully, **it's** incredibly hard. I work in the kitchen, and we are so short-staffed that I ask myself if this is even worth taking over. We don't have a head chef, just two chefs and me. Three **guys** operating a business year-round? **It's** crazy we've even made it this far.\n\nOur business has changed a lot over the years. Going from having head chefs and many cooks to just three of us shows that business has slowed.\n\nMy father doesn't understand social media, and the advertising for our business has been very poor. \n\n* What are some questions I need to ask myself here?\n* What questions can I ask my father to see evidence of long-term business growth?\n* Should I quit to work at other restaurants and see how they operate?\n\nI wanted to pursue a career in graphic design but who am I kidding, ill earn at most 45k gross a year and probably lose my job to you know what(Cant say the word as its banned)\n\nThanks",

If the total is more than 100k per year, then the restaurant doesn’t net anything - it’s losing money. \n\nRenting below market value is also a loss of income. \n\nMany small business “owners” think they own a business, when all they really have is a terrible job.

I'm only a few years older than you but was around the same age when I was introduced and \"required\" in a sense to take over.\n\nWhat may have worked for him in the past may not work in modern times as you mentioned, your father does not understand social media. You however do so it is left to you to follow up and try something with it as our society mostly revolves around social media now. An idea would be perhaps try to find if there are influencers (doesn't have to be incredibly famous) in your area who review food joints and treat them to a full course meal.\n\nIf the food you are serving is good and there is still business along with frequently returning customers, then that part doesn't need immediate attention. Try the influencer idea first and if traffic picks up then you will have the financial leisure to hire a head chef. This way you could perhaps add new and more modern dishes to the menu for testing. It's all trial and error at the end of the day and I believe that we are more fitted for failure than our parents who most likely started the business from scratch with no back up. However what we do have is the foundation that they have laid out for us and if one dish fails, it's not going to change much if any, just keep trying.\n\nI wish you the best of luck and hopefully provided a bit of help. It's a lot of pressure at once but I'd say both you and I are somewhat lucky to be in such a situation. A lot of people are just slaving away and would pray to be in a situation such as this.\n\nEdit: typos",

They must sit in the booth and be ready to support and or work if needed.\n\nThis is more for them to let go slowly and it’s probably one of the great favors you will ever do them to two things: still feel needed and ease into awareness they are not needed because the place is in the hands they raised. \n\nThis is important for them they put their everything into it and a transitional structure is emotionally needed. Especially at the age they are and the letting go at that age scares elderly of any cut of cloth because everyone this age thinks about losing their edge just when they have earned relaxation. I’m talking about faculties, bruv.\n\nMeanwhile, you are busy not only optimizing everything you can (that hasn’t been done already) and making alterations that show the customers what a great tradition is continuing in the community. This is smart business.\n\nThe real transfer of leadership (despite your managerial skills) will come when the matriarchal ladies of your community make complimentary comments to your parents at their table praising you.\n\nThey get to beam proudly and always will and you learn the community grants you customer side ownership socially. The smaller the town, the more important this is.\n\nA few years later, after the menu and decor and productivity changes you made your thumbprint with are established, one day your parents won’t be sitting at their table you set for them.\n\nHave something set aside and call a travel agent and send them on a cruise for at least a couple weeks.  They will love it and reconnect with a lot of each other they didn’t have time for because of the 17 years of hustle. This will be happiness you gave them.\n\nThey will begin to spend more time at home and not too many years of your life have passed.  You have done right by them and have kept yourself in the game of “I still can go do what I want.”\n\nThis is important for your life.\n\nUr 28, and after all this transitions you will prolly be 33-35.\n\nAll this while, to yourself, you have been keeping and eye on the market around your area and the right time to sell the business will become evident.  Have a broker, a good broker lined up as things change macro economically quite quickly sometimes and let the economy save you from the emotions everyone will have, including your parents because selling would have been a big economic mistake not to jump.\n\nYour parents will understand most of all.\n\nYou will still be young, have been saving and investing all this while because your salary is in the budget like everyone else’s and you have no real reason to do anything but invest for the future anyway working your 50-60 hour weeks.\n\nIf ownership isn’t clear by gosh deadline it in the takeover talks.  \n\nThen jump when the money comes in a decent offer.  The broker is feduciarily obligated to make sure you get a fair price and you’re going to be 35, have investments and savings while you managed and a big check for the sale of the business, happy parents who couldn’t have had the takeover go any sweeter, and still have a lot of youth and years ahead of you.\n\nThere’s only one real hitch, and it’s not a bug it’s a feature- you may want to keep it going and pass it on to your kids.",

My guess is also the restaurant has a lot of deferred maintenance that will cost tens of thousands of dollars/pounds to fix.  So their 100k income might work fine for their life, there's a very real chance it won't work for you in 2025/26.\n\nUltimately while it's a generous offer in many ways, it's also a bit of a poisoned chalice because they're giving you a business that requires you to do a lot of work, doesn't pay enough, and needs a bunch of money invested.\n\nThe other way to take this is a completely different option:  \"Dad, there's just no way I can take on all that you do.  I don't know how you do it.  If I take over, the business will surely fail.  I'd much rather see you sell it to someone than have to worry about taking it over and failing.\"",

This is common among business owners... if you were to open your own graphic design studio, you may find yourself doing multiple roles (and capable of doing them faster and more efficiently than hiring).\n\nThat said, first evaluate why your father is doing those roles.  It sounds like you used to have hired staff, but due to reduced revenue the roles have been cut, resulting in him doing them just to keep money going.  This is admirable.\n\nThe problem is by being so overwhelmed, everyone involved is so busy working in the business that no one is working on the business.\n\nCut items, inventory, and stock for menu items that aren't selling.  Start developing more.  Specifically designed to maximize social media appeal.  You haven't mentioned what genre of resturuant, but just rip some basic ideas.  Make a crazy complicated milkshake with a piece of pie and ice cream on the top. Sell a giant cookie shaped like a taco with ice cream in it.  \n\nIdeas has nothing to do with your genre... you have a very unique opportunity you will never have in a job:  You have an inside route to control what is or is not on the menu and likely all other related operations.\n\nIf you want to pursue graphic design, you should be doing it for the restaurant.  No reason to go to school or get a job in it, you literally can already start doing it.  \n\nYou're doing dual duty sure, but your goal of doing dual duty is to create menu items and design ads that bring in more customers.  More customers = more revenue = hiring more people.  \n\nYou would advance infinately further in your career doing this for 1 year than in a job.

It is a family hobby that is being treated like a business.\n\nBefore you look at profits or future plans, you need clear answers to some very basic questions.\n\nHow much is your father paying himself.\n\nHow much is he paying you.\n\nHow much is he paying your mother.\n\nAnd most importantly, are these amounts paid before or after the stated 100K net profit. Without clarity on this, the number means absolutely nothing.\n\nThe next step is a proper financial analysis of the business. You cannot base decisions on the 100k figure. You need a full overview that includes the value of the building, the full kitchen equipment, the nearby house if that is part of the setup, and the amount of cash or liquid assets the business has. If the restaurant has been operating for 17 years, nets around 100K per year, and you say it used to be more successful, I would expect there to be a minimum of 200K to 1M in cash or equivalents. If that money is not there, you need to understand exactly where it went.\n\nYou should also separate the real estate from the restaurant business in your thinking. Check what similar buildings rent for in your area. If the property could realistically be rented out for 4K to 10K per month, your parents could still generate fifty to one hundred thousand per year in rental income while retired, and you would be free to pursue a different job.\n\nIf you are considering continuing the restaurant, do a market analysis. Look at how many people actually live in the area, how other restaurants nearby are performing, and whether this is a touristic region or are you guys fully dependent on regulars. How old is the surrounding population Are your prices too high, or are they actually too low etc...\n\nNext go through the menu in detail and recalculate your pricing. A simple rule of thumb is that if something costs you 1 dollar it should sell for at least x4 to x5 that amount. You need to calculate gross revenue, food cost, labor cost, overhead, and the actual net profit behind that 100K figure.  \nThen you need to add realistic labor costs for all the roles your father currently fulfills. Then recalculate your menu prices and ask yourself honestly whether customers would still be willing to pay those prices. If the answer is yes, you raise prices gradually. If the answer is no, then the business model itself is the problem.\n\nIf you have a decent POS system, you should be able to see exactly which items sold over the past year. Compare those numbers to your menu. Items that only sell a few times per year should be removed.\n\nAlso don't forget you have some advantages compared to people your age who want to start a restaurant business. You are not paying rent, and you do not need to buy or lease kitchen equipment. Depending on the area, that alone can be a100K per year advantage",

He also took out a $40k loan under the business without telling me, and I still don’t know what the money was used for. The business account is drained, and we’re now in debt under both of our names. He is not sorry for what he's done.\n\nTo make things worse, we never signed any formal partnership agreement, but we did create an LLC. I was inexperienced and didn’t realize how risky that was.\n\nI want to leave and start my own business, but I’ve spent five years helping build the reputation, customer base, and goodwill of this one. I’d like him to keep the current business, but I feel like I should be compensated for the value I helped create.\n\nHow can I determine what a fair buyout amount would be?

          "body": "This is practical advice only based on my experience. \n\nI've been party to an unfriendly two-person LLC breakup, with me and a silent partner. As the operating member I made financial decisions, including for my own compensation, with which my silent partner later took issue. He sued and I lawyered up, just like you will do.\n\nHis suit focused on my comp. My goal all along had been to buy him out of the company, but he was completely non-responsive to any communication. So having him sue me was a good thing in that sense--it started the process. That's a strategy--your partner will have to pay attention.\n\nBut--as soon as he sued, I had legal representation from a top-5 law firm. I think receiving my response to his suit from a very serious firm settled him down a bit and let him know that we would not be bullied or put off. That was key, in my opinion. \n\nOur response proposed that we submit the matter to mediation. But we required him to drop the suit, reasoning that we could talk or we could fight but not both. We mediated and came to a price that was about what I had thought to offer him before he sued. I even got him to finance it.\n\nI'm sharing this because I believe it would be wise to figure out what you want to have happen, but also how you would like it to happen. Think down the road past the dispute and keep it about numbers, whether you want to retain the business or walk away. There may be other considerations. For example, I'd suggest talking to your bank about an SBA loan to potentially finance the company on the other side of the transaction. Your partner may not have a lot of cash if he's taking from the company. If you take him out of the existing company and finance it over time (not optimal, given distrust), you may need some cash for operations. Or, on the other hand, he may need financing to buy you out (though that might be tough if the books are a mess). \n\nAbout mediation--I think my legal costs were about $25K (though I got a bit of deal through connections), much less than they would have been had we pursued the matter via lawsuit, and really just noise in terms of the total buyout cost.  \n\nGood luck.",

So I left.\n\nNow I’m building two things from scratch , one is a small, steady business that’s working but still fragile, and the other is a more ambitious idea that needs constant experimentation. Marketing, testing, figuring out ads, learning how much attention everything really demands… I massively underestimated how competitive and mentally exhausting this phase is.\n\nThe hardest part isn’t even the money. It’s the identity shift.\n\nI used to be “the one with the good job.” Now I’m the person explaining I’m building something and hoping it doesn’t sound like I’m making excuses. It’s choosing cheaper dinners, skipping trips, and feeling that subtle sting when old colleagues casually mention bonuses.\n\nSome days it’s empowering. Other days it’s honestly humbling in ways I didn’t expect.\n\nWhat I’ve gained, though, is a whole new respect for anyone who makes it through this awkward middle stretch , the part where nothing is certain yet and you’re lying awake at 3AM wondering if you made the bravest decision of your life… or the dumbest.\n\nIf you’ve gone through that identity whiplash after leaving a “safe” career, I’d really like to hear how you handled it.",

It’s a quieter kind of confidence, but a more durable one.\n\nYou’re not weak for feeling this. You’re in the part most people never see because they turn back before it passes. Hearing from others helps, but so does recognizing that this discomfort is a byproduct of growth, not a signal you failed.",

Set up location-specific folders for assets and drafts, so you’re not digging around every time you post.\n3. Schedule posts in batches and plan a month ahead where possible.

I own several locations of a food business that I began 15 years ago. I employ a large number of college age people and a healthy number of 20somethings, then a group of people in their 30s and early 40s that have worked here since I started the business.\n\nThe problem we run into many times a year is we can’t grant everyone their day off requests. We can get staff really trimmed down, but we still need people to work. We have shortened hours on holidays, which are our busiest days of the year, but when we have to deny a day off request, they end up calling in sick anyway. It happened Christmas Eve, it happened again this morning.\n\nIf you have a similar business, retail or food service that needs to be open holidays (not the actual holiday but the day before), how do you handle it when literally everyone asks for the same day off? And then calls in anyway??\n\nObviously I’m frustrated this morning because I have several locations that are completely screwed and have customers picking up orders etc. etc. And I can’t be in all places at the same time.\n\nOutside of a holiday, how do you handle people calling off a shift and no one else picking it up? Do you have a sick day policy like they have have to produce a doctors note after so many days?\n\nThanks so much, any advice is welcome!\n\nEditing to add: thank you for the feedback! I appreciate it so much. We do time and a half for the holiday and day before, and at the end of the year they get a bonus for every holiday worked. For most of them, time and a half is around $25, for some it’s closer to $40. The problem is most of them don’t need the job. They’ll quit if they don’t get the days off or if we require a doctors note. They’ll argue they don’t have insurance and don’t need a job and they peace out. It wasn’t this bad a few years ago but this year and last it’s been constant.",

This is one of the most frustrating realities of running a food business right now especially with a workforce that does not actually need the job.\n\nFirst off you are already doing more than most. Time and a half holiday premiums end of year bonuses. That is solid. At some point though money stops being the lever. If someone is willing to quit over working Christmas Eve no incentive was going to change that.\n\nOne thing that has helped me and others I know is intentional over hiring around holidays. You know these days are coming and you know call offs will happen. Bring in seasonal or short term people who actually want the hours. They are usually grateful not jaded and far more likely to show up. Even better if you can cross train across locations so you are not stuck when one store gets hit.\n\nIf you can swing it build a small on call bench. Pay them a small flat rate to be available and if they get called in they get the full shift pay plus the premium. It is cheaper than losing sales and sanity.\n\nThe other big piece is clear firm policies and sticking to them every single time. Holiday time off has to be first come first served. Once the schedule is posted that is it. If someone gets denied and then magically gets sick that gets documented. No drama no arguing just tracked.\n\nInstead of doctors notes which usually blow up in your face go with progressive consequences. A couple unexcused call offs fine. Keep doing it and you lose priority for holidays preferred shifts or hours. If it becomes a pattern you move on. Not as punishment just because reliability actually matters in this business.\n\nAnd honestly this is the hardest but most freeing mindset shift. Not everyone is a fit for a job that requires holidays. That is okay. But it is not optional. If someone would rather quit than work one or two key days a year they are telling you who they are. Let them.\n\nOne unreliable person can wreck an entire location burn out your good people and put you in firefighting mode all day. At some point protecting the business and the team that does show up has to come first.\n\nYou are doing your best in a tough environment. Tightening the structure is not being heartless it is how you keep the whole thing from breaking.",

Basically each quarter or month (depends on how the business works), we set aside a fixed percentage of gross profits that goes into the employee bonus pool.  All else being equal, that pool gets evenly divided across everyone who works there so long as they've worked for the whole period (you can't get hired 3 days before bonus day and get paid out).  But, anyone who has an unexcused absence during the period simply becomes ineligible for the bonus pool.  That means everyone else gets a little more and it becomes a legitimate incentive as the period goes on, more people miss a day, etc.  The only real downside in practical terms is that if someone has an attendance hit 2 days into the period, it's kind of a write-off for them to miss more days.  But, I found most of our good employees didn't have that kind of attitude anyway.  Good luck, sounds like a challenging business!",

          "body": "So there are some things you have to take into account here.  Holidays should be business closed days so everyone can spend time with their family and actually have the holiday.\n\nBeing open is a choice that comes with consequences which will always be people wanting to actually take the day off and may take the day off no matter what management says.\n\nFor Christmas I drove around to see who was open and who was closed and respecting their employees over trying to make a squeeze of profits.  Same goes with professionals in the NFL, nobody wants to work on Christmas, they want to be at home with their family and doing this year over year on Holidays really messed up their family they are trying to build and maintain.\n\nAs a business you have to think about the people that work for you and how working on a day the whole country gets off and how it makes them feel to just be there working for 1/100th of their value.\n\nNow I understand it might be a busy day, and you choose to be open because you make a ton of money but you have to pay the price for being open on a national holiday which means staff crunch.  Now if you want to show some care and love and have to be open because it is good for cashflow do so but also make sure you are paying by default holiday pay.\n\nWhy holiday pay you ask, because extra pay is how businesses actually say thank you when asking people to do things they normally wouldn't do like work on the holidays.  If this means paying them 3x or 4x their hourly rate to include overttime that will more than likely drastically reduce your problem with people calling out or taking off during this time.  You might even have the problem of too many people requesting to work during this time.\n\nMoney talks, you want to send a message to the employees that them being their is wonderful for the business let your checkbook do the talking.  I would actually recommend setting a new policy that starting January 1, 2026 Xx holiday pay will be standard going forward. Whatever that multiplier is you set it and maybe even make it variable starting at 2x and going up depending on how bad you need people there.  Send that out and make sure you send out a reminder before holidays come up weeks in advance to get bookings and make sure you have enough people on staff in case a couple of people are legitimately sick and need to stay home.\n\nJust like in big business if you want someone to work on Thanksgiving, 4th of July, Christmas, etc. it better be an emergency.  Treating these as normal work days shows zero empathy and doesn't set things well if you are also looking for people to stay long term.  Let the money speak and you'll see some serious change in your staffing situations.",

I’ve seen this exact issue in food + retail businesses, especially with younger staff who don’t need the job.\n\nWhat eventually worked for a few operators I know wasn’t tighter rules, but predictability + consequences:\n\n• Holidays aren’t “request off” days — they’re opt-in work days decided months in advance. If you opt in, you’re committing. If you opt out, you’re not scheduled at all and that’s known upfront.\n• Calling in sick on a denied request off day = treated differently than a random sick day. Not punishment, just fewer preferred shifts going forward.\n• Managers stop scrambling to save every shift. If a location has to shorten hours or close early once or twice, staff quickly realize the policy isn’t bluffing.\n\nThe hard truth is: if most of your staff doesn’t need the job, incentives stop working. At that point it becomes about building a smaller core of reliable people and designing around expected absenteeism instead of reacting to it.\n\nIt sucks, but I don’t think this is you doing something wrong — it’s a labor reality shift the last couple years.",

People work for incentive, not for you, or \"rules\" lol. Employees (aka people) would rather be with their family, make it worth their while. Not sure why that is so clear to me and not others, they are people. If they are declining or \"opting out\" whatever you are offering is not enough. Make it voluntary, let them know upfront how much the bonus will be plus double time, signup for the voluntary work a month ahead of time, if no one signups add more bonus until it doesn't make sense anymore for you, and then close those days, or pay triple time and a bonus and take a loss to keep the customers happy for repeat business.

      "selftext": "Hello Reddit, \n\nI recently hired an employee who has a physical disability which results him in having little fine motor skills which is essential for the work that he would be doing. It's becoming pretty obvious to me that he would probably be working at 0.5-0.7x of the speed any other employee would be working at. This is my third employee I've hired (second employee I currently have). How do I navigate letting him go? Obviously this is a pretty finicky area with the disability and I'm not trying to get any sort of fine or break any sort of fair employment law. Anyone have any advice on what to do and especially what not to do?\n\n  \nI'm in California since that probably matters.",

          "body": "I’m not familiar with Cali laws but should be similar issues like NY which have strong employee protections.\n\n1. Setup an employee manual. Have your employment attorney set that up for you, it is state and city specific. Don’t go cheap here, it will be pricey to set it up for first time. It will cost you a lot more if you don’t set it up correctly. \n\n2. Setup probationary period. I recommend it just under when unemployment insurance kicks in. For NY, it’s 6 months. We have ours set at 5 months and 29 days. That means, you can terminate whenever you want without dinging your UI premium.\n\n3. Setup employee duties and KPI’s. It must be clearly  stated and listed in your employee manual. Failure to meet KPI = retraining, sanction, then eventual termination.\n\n4. Evaluation - new hire are evaluated weekly for first 8 weeks. They need to know whether they’re meeting KPI’s or not. The written evaluation with KPI metrics is what legally protects you. Employee may claim any false statements, but a weekly evaluation with poor KPI and signed by both you and the employee, that is your proof that you terminated due to poor KPI, not due to whatever issue they claim. Depending on nature of the job, after 8 weeks, we do bi weekly then monthly. We switch to quarterly for all employees after probation.\n\nMost small business owners don’t do evaluations, and find quarterly to be a pain. You want to do this so you can also give bonus and rewards based on KPI’s. We give staff bonuses for monthly KPI’s and quarterly KPI. It also shows to the employee that you are the captain of the ship, employees want a leader. Most owners are not leaders therefore there's nobody manning the helm. That invites employees to start getting away with anything, such as theft, time clock theft, PTO abuse, etc. Quarterly eval and business meetings help reinforce your business vision and goals, which boost morale and focus employee energy to a productive goal.\n\nOnce you list KPI’s are not being met, give a verbal warning. Document it in their file, date, time, what you said and their response. Email yourself for time stamp proof. Employees get two verbals then written reprimands.\n\nAs the old saying is true, fire fast, hire slow. I’d talk with your employment attorney quick, prep to terminate that employee soon.\n\nFuture hiring, create a more stringent hiring system to ensure they can do the KPI’s. That employee should never have made pass the screening phase, definitely shouldn’t have made pass the interview test which should include testing the KPI’s, and if they somehow made it through and not meeting KPI, terminate within 2 weeks or sooner.",

Also in my business, we make the best products in the market and it still applies. You could make the best product possible and 1% of people will complain. You need to accept this fact. Don't let negative feedback pull you down. Too much negative feedback as a % of sales is what you should be concerned about.\n\n3-Just do it, if the risk is low, JUST TRY THE THING. We spent too long trying to make the perfect product, listings, images etc. You learn more by just doing. We also know that as much as 30% of everything we list will fail. So we will remove it from Amazon FBA after time (this applies to any business). \n\n4-The right people are more important than anything else. Do you have the right mix? Do you complement each other? Can you drive eachother forward? Success can be magnified X10 or even fail depending on the people. If they aren't the right fit, walk away.

      "selftext": "I’ve always wanted to own my own coffee shop, I’ve had a name and vibe for it for years, but have never really pursued it because I didn’t think I’d be capable of making it happen so it’s always just been a dream, I’m currently just about finished with my bachelors in communications, particularly marketing and it’s making me think a lot about how I could be marketing for my own coffee shop so I kind of want to get some ideas and opinions from other small business owners/ coffee shop owners. I’ve been a barista for about 8 years now. I spent about 5 1/2 years In a local coffee shop and almost 3 years at a huge corporation ahem.. Starbucks which sucks and isn’t real coffee but I needed the benefits. So I have plenty of barista experience. I have been a supervisor/manager at both places. The small business i handled all of the inventory, did a lot of the marketing, a lot of the drink creating and spent a lot of my time and effort there. So I know how internally a coffee shop works and runs too but having my own business seems intimidating. I live in a very populated city, where coffee is a huge demand I’ve found a location I’d love to rent that fits the moody/ witchy vibe I’m going for (garage door, loft, rustic, dark exterior vibe) it’s apart of shopping/event center which I think would be perfect for foot traffic and exposure. There’s no coffee competition, just a hair salon, tattoo shop, bakery, pizza shop, brewery and some boutiques. I’ve done a lot of the research and have calculated the price of all of the things I’d need to do and have, my question I guess is what’s next? How do you make it happen? Is it worth it? ",

It's hard work... And you have to be able to work long hours and lead from the front. Keep all your costs low, and start with skeleton staff... and add more staff in when you need them,\n... it's ok to be busy and have people wait for a good product as long as they can see you are being efficient... if they are standing around waiting while staff are wandering around chatting or being a prima Madonna with the coffee machine they'll be gone. Don't buy the 'best' equipment, or have the best fit out but make sure it is functional, efficient and looks good. Make the coffee prices competitive but make sure you charge for every extra, and have lots of visually appealing grab and go style treats and food well displayed near the point of sale. And also try and budget for custom printed takeaway cups. Hopefully you are a good barista that is clean and efficient, has a good eye for extraction and making timing and grind adjustments and can effortlessly make silky smooth milks.... Because remember you must lead from the front and set a high standard for your staff. Good luck.",

Drop shipping, courses, affiliate marketing - it's all the same pitch with different wrapper. You spend 60 hours a week for 18 months building the thing, then maybe - MAYBE - you get to work 20 hours a week maintaining it while pretending you're on a beach somewhere.\n\nMeanwhile, the guy who opened a boring HVAC company in 2019 is pulling $200K profit and actually takes weekends off because he hired competent people and built systems that don't break every time Google changes an algorithm.​\n\nThe real kicker? Half the \"passive income\" gurus on YouTube are making their money teaching you how to make passive income. It's turtles all the way down.​\n\nI'm not saying don't automate or systematize - that's just smart business. But can we stop pretending that any income stream doesn't need feeding? Your Shopify store isn't a Tamagotchi. It needs actual work.​\n\nSo here's my question: when did \"I run a profitable business that doesn't consume my entire life\" become less sexy than \"I make $47 a month while I sleep\"?",

The world is more complex now and a term such as passive income doesn't really explain things or cover the entire breadth of all possible types of passive income.\n\nA better word is simply 'work'. Business takes work and it's always a gamble. The gamble on some types of businesses take longer to pay off or see a return. But lets say content creation as an example - this can take years to pay off but when you reach a certain point, you can call it passive income (to an extent).\n\nThis ties very heavily into the platforms someone chooses. If you are a streamer then your income is almost 100% tied to performing streams. If you do youtube then your income relies on you staying relevant so that your content is promoted. If you stop, your income wont stop immediately but its still tied to putting out content.\n\nI'm not saying this is a better business model than any other, but it does have unique advantages. You can quit youtube for a whole month (or longer) if you build up enough content to release on a schedule. People do this all the time. During this holiday or time off, the income is passive.

And actually if you see how many hours you need to invest regularly, you see that it's a job still.\n\n2) A classic example of renting out assets, such as real estate - you make several grand each month and feel that it's passive income since you rarely do much more than collecting rent, but in reality you have maintenance, depreciation, pay taxes on it, service fees, insurance, etc and have risks like insolvent tenants that would be hard to evict / vandalism, etc., and in the long run you could be far better off selling that house / apartment, putting your money into S&amp;P 500.

Businesspeople wouldn't try to shut their brain off, nor would they seek out the adrenaline rush of undue risk, they engage in risk-reduction. Wantrepreneurs instead amp themselves up to recklessness and put themselves on the wrong side of the percentages.\n\nHad you read posts here, you would notice many details. People ask what is possible here, not what the probability is. Even moderately skilled gamblers make themselves aware of the odds. As they would read books on gambling. Most have what they will call a 'system' for wagering worked out, a strategy.\n\nHere, I had to write a big long post to explain the relationships between words like \"strategy\" and \"tactic\" and \"objective\" and \"technology.\" Because people were posting to ask about digital strategy and commenters would post the name of this weeks magic platform. Not why, how to use it, what to do. Just the name. And nobody even blinked.\n\nI wouldn't just hesitate. I would fold up my money, put it back in my pocket, then walk away from such a lunatic fringe. The last thing I would consider is popular advice to crap something out, market-blind and trust to the luck I just slapped in the face. These guys make a gambling addiction look like sanity.\n\nThe business answer to hesitation is study, risk-reduction, due diligence, and well-ordered thought. The quippy retorts actually posted to counter this are lunacy and almost qualify as hysterical over-reaction. I'm not advocating for delay nor do I endorse anything different from what an eighth-grade student does when writing a moderately important book report. A few days is typical for such a task and makes zero difference.\n\nPeople here behave as if books cause cancer and research is a four-letter word. Which indicates where all the bad business math comes from. Just Do It dogma causes an attitude of all gas, no brakes ...which leads them to crash their venture into a ditch. Only to post here like a distraught child with a broken toy they've come to an adult to fix. \n\nIf you're so curious, you could have scrolled through posted issues and posted an analysis. This would have been a contribution to the forum, rather than the common strip-mining operation everybody tries.",

          "body": "I have been running my own freelance business for about 5 years now and I think the simplest way to describe it is that I am basically a business partner for hire. People come to me with an idea or an existing business and I set up the administrative side, collab on the entreprenuerial side, and help them develop the \"technician\" side (the product/service in which they are the expert and I don't desire to be a part of - plumbing, building cabinets, or cleaning offices for example). \n\nHere are the main hangups I often see (in no order):\n\n* lack of understanding of what drives business success - Lets say a person wants to start or runs a new locksmithing business. You see a lot of someone thinking something like \"I need to be on TikTok but I don't know how\" to get a business started rather than \"I should go talk to the property manager of this nearby office building and ask who they use for rekeys and lockouts\" (I actually dont know anything about locksmiths but hopefully that makes sense)\n* Incorrect understanding of priorities - similar to above, but I see people focus on something like Social Media before they have their offer and audience figured out and really understand what they are trying to say and who they are trying to say it to. \n* getting overwhelmed by the different \"lanes\" - It's a lot at first to think about not just your service and customers, but also payment processing, invoicing, licenses/insurance, a website, social media, brand, bookkeeping, lead generation, SOPs, and everything else. It can be difficult to carry so many different moving parts, and shuts a lot of people down.\n* All or nothing thinking - This one is similar to the \"lanes\" but its really about overthinking and perfectionism. Believing you need to be 100% dialed in or you aren't ready. It's a good way to keep yourself working towards continuous improvement if you harness the energy, but it kills most people's ideas because you will never have a project fully dialed in before you take a step.\n* Lack of due diligence - People tend to make TONS of assumptions about demand, competition, audience, costs, and other things that they should really take the time to go gather data on - and it has NEVER been easier to get decent data on just about anything than it is now. Acting on bad assumptions has been a huge cause of wasted energy and effort with a lot of business owners I know and work with.\n* fear of networking - this one is simple. Lots of folks are just afraid to talk to people, and even more of them are affraid to talk about their business and why it is awesome.\n* a desire to do it all yourself - This is usually from a cost perspective. I build a lot of websites for clients, often as a one-off service based on referrals. I'd say at least half of the clients I work with have a website that they feel ashamed of that they attempted to build themselves and want me to help them. It is almost always that they didn't want to spend the kind of money that a lot of agencies wanted to charge them (which is also understandable because that is usually nuts also). So, they try to do it themselves. What they don't see is that the amount of time spent on it if looked at from a $/hr perspective isn't usually far off from what they would have paid someone else to do it, and they would have ended up with a decent site rather than a site that they feel does not represent the quality of their business (even if it was overpriced). Nobody would ever try this with something like taxes, but it is WAY too common with stuff like logos, social media, and websites especially. The kicker is that a plumber could be out doing paying jobs INSTEAD of spending that time building a website, which they have zero ability to do.\n\nI have worked with a ton of different types of businesses across different industries, and most of my friends run businesses of some kind, and those are the biggest ones that I see. I think this is why mentorship helps so much - you have someone who can help you see reality. \n\nIn my opinion, entrepreneurship and running a business are huge practices in checking your own thoughts and assumptions, seeing things clearly and without your own filters, and being able to look at things from different perspectives - being objective and getting out of your own way.",

I currently make good money working at a W-2 software company and people in tech complain about 9-9-6, but in the small business world it is more like 6-11-7. I understand the tax savings and potential lifestyle if the small business runs itself once it becomes successful. However, the extreme mental and financial stress is something I have witnessed and I am fortunate enough not needing to do that since our family will make $700k in W-2 in a few years after my spouse finishes up residency. Only thing that is fun and low stress for us is real estate leasing since it is mostly hands off compared to running a small business but it has a capped upside but also a quite large capital investment.\n\nSo to answer your question, W-2 is comfortable and relatively stress free compared to starting a real small business from the ground up.",

And that I'm scared of failing at 'business social media'. That I am afraid of lenders saying no and that's it, no more chances. Or worse, they say yes and I fuck the whole thing up.\n\nI've got fears to face and plenty of work to do but I already feel better just writing it down and acknowledging it. \n\nNext steps is seeking more frequent, smaller feedback from my mentor and writing things down. Stop thinking of every little 'what if' at once and get it on paper as smaller tasks. And, get offline, go find a business group to awkwardly have coffee with :)",

One wrong hire and your credibility is gone. You’d also have to find a whole lot more people justify the cost of adding staff. Payroll taxes, benefits, supplies, etc are just the starting point.\n\nIf you keep it small and boutique, but high touch, hospitality-focused and really provide the experience a customer is looking for, you can charge whatever you want. Wealthy people pay for their time and stress to be lowered. They’ll pay much more than you think. If you can give them their time back (10 hours per week for example) what is that worth to them?

I don't even know how many times I met with the previous owner. At least a dozen. \n\nWhat I was looking for was signs that the business was healthy but they had the wrong owner, or wrong marketing strategy, or wrong fulfillment, etc. Had it been that their customers liked them but they had inconsistent cleaners, I could fix that. \n\nIt ended up being that they had low prices and one main customer who was up for a new contract within the first 6 months of when I would've taken that business over.

Regulations: particularly important is square footage per student and teacher to student counts as they relate to classroom size. You also want to look at bathroom rules.  For instance our classes are set up where we have the exact square footage for a teacher and an aide to operate with the legal student numbers. We have in classroom bathrooms that allows the aide to handle that while the teacher continues.  We have a floating teacher that does enrichment that lets the mainline teachers take a lunch break. In other words you want to maximize labor to student counts while maintaining a good product. This stuff is so decisive we had an offer for free use of a building that we declined because the room sizes and bathroom locations made it a nightmare on labor to effectively staff it\n\n2. Security: Prior to Uvalde we had a dozen police officers who we gave tuition discounts to in exchange for working pick up and drop off. Since Uvalde we have an armed officer on campus at any time students are there.  Parents want to feel their kids are safe. Off duty cops make $45-$55 an hour in our area. If it doesn't have a camera system better set aside the money to put one in. \n\n3. Competition: Does the school district offer free pre k and kinder? If so you better deliver a high quality preschool rather than a day care or you are limited to very young kids who are more labor intensive.  Also be aware that many churches use preschool and daycare to both draw in new members and absorb building overhead costs but don't expect them to pay off the mortgage on a building or generate a profit. In both cases you may have legacy competition with essentially free real estate\n\n4. What sort of state funding is available for tuition and how bureaucratic is that system? If you go that route you may have a significant staff chasing reimbursement payments.\n\n5. Who is your customer and are you convenient? We specialize as the high end pre school. We are around the corner from the high end elementary magnet elementary school so multi kid parents aren't trying to drive across town.  As a result we have a very geographically diverse student body. Other schools mostly grab from either the residential neighborhoods near them or in the case of the downtown ones the employers near them.\n\n6. What's the vaccine policy? Highly polarizing issue that will cause parents to not consider you or leave when you choose one or the other.\n\nBig piece of due diligence I'd ask for is their file from the state regulators.",

How fast do you think you can get teachers for 100+ students?\n\nDaycares can have waiting lists for months, so getting students shouldn't be a constraint it's just hiring, training, and retaining the staff to allow you to intake 100+ students. Also notice how I say teacher and not staff. You will likely have staff who won't be with kids so they can't count towards the teacher:kid ratio.\n\nLet's say the state mandates 1 teacher for every 7 students. You should absolutely strive to be better than that, let's say 1:5. This allows you to have teachers call in sick and still be in compliance with the ratio set by law.",

Private equity firms are likely to snap up a decently-run center because they can add it to a larger portfolio and spread the risk around.

Fraudulent workers’ comp claims, now increasingly framed as “mental stress,” have driven our insurance costs to an unsustainable level. The financial impact has been devastating, not because we did something wrong, but because defending ourselves, even against claims with no merit, is incredibly expensive.\n\nWhat has made this even more alarming is seeing claims and PAGA filings arrive in bulk, with little apparent due diligence. We’ve now been hit with multiple PAGA cases, including one against a company that has never even had an employee. Despite that, we still have to pay attorneys just to prove the obvious.\n\nThe money being spent on legal defense is money that should be going to employee raises, better benefits, and keeping a long-standing business healthy. Instead, it’s being siphoned into attorney fees and skyrocketing insurance premiums.\n\nI’m sharing this because I’m genuinely wondering if other California employers, especially in agriculture or other labor-intensive industries, are experiencing the same thing. Has anyone else been targeted by Abramson Labor Group, or seen a sudden wave of workers’ comp and PAGA filings?\n\nThis isn’t about opposing worker protections. Those matter. This is about a system that has lost balance and is pushing responsible employers to the brink.\n\nIf you’re dealing with something similar, you’re not alone. And if you’re wondering why so many family-run businesses are struggling or leaving the state, this is a big part of the reason why.\n",

If you could generate a 40% profit margin before tax and all cost deducted, you'd be in fantastic shape.\n\nYou could become a reseller for a brand that is unknow in you area and sell their goods. You could pursue a brand that stand for sustainability and dislike fast fashion etc. Which will give you higher profit margins.\n\nOr maybe there is a restaurant in your area that doesn't have take away yet.

There are perks but there are many additional stresses as well. You're going to have to pay and manage your own insurances (health, business, etc), finding work, keeping jobs coming in, marketing, negotiating, dealing with the public, unrealistic deadlines and being held accountable for anything that goes wrong. That's not even the tip of the iceberg. No matter how strong or motivated you are, there's always going to be worry and fear in the back of your mind about things going wrong or slowing down. It's not all glorious, and I often envy those with more consistent pay-checks and less worries. The freedom of it does come with a price. I watched the health of some of my friends suffer because of the stresses of owning a business. I have suffered the same fate and believe my mental, physical and relationships have all suffered from the constant struggle / hustle of trying to keep the engine moving. I suffered my worst  break down and had to seek  therapy which is something I thought I'd never have to do - not all  because of the business but because of not being equipped to handle the stresses that comes with it.  My best advice is to have a strong mind, soul and body.  Be prepared to constantly work on and keep your metal health as top priority. Second would be physical because it does take a toll. Last, be able to balance your relationships with work or that too will suffer. Trust me, I thought I had it all together until I became a business owner. Then it exposed every flaw and weakness in me. If you can maintain your sanity and keep your mental and physically well-being as top priority, the sky is the limit. I'm still in it but it played a role in breaking me, and I'm looking for ways to eventually scale back and transition out. Best of luck",

I noticed how many students needed phone and laptop repairs and decided to start fixing devices myself cracked screens, dead phones, struggling laptops, whatever people brought in.\n\nThat small side idea slowly turned into a real business. Over time, we expanded into full electronics repair: phones, laptops, tablets, and more. What began as word-of-mouth work locally has grown into what it is today.\n\nToday we are in the US and also have a branch in the UK, was advised by a friend to replicate while he manages. Even with growth, we’ve focused on keeping repair quality and customer trust consistent across locations.\n\nNow I’m looking ahead and trying to figure out how to scale further without losing what made it work in the first place. For those who’ve grown service-based businesses:\n\n* How do you scale while maintaining quality?\n* Is franchising a good move for repair businesses?\n* What systems or processes matter most at this stage?\n\nWould love to hear lessons learned or mistakes to avoid.

The moment quality depends on “this tech just knows how we do things,” you’re capped.\n\nA few things that usually matter most at this stage:\n• Defining what “good repair” actually means in measurable terms (checklists, tolerances, time-to-resolution, post-repair testing)\n• Locking down intake + diagnosis so every location solves the same problem the same way\n• Training for judgment, not just steps — why certain repairs get declined, refunded, or escalated\n\nFranchising can work in repair, but only once the above is boringly documented. Otherwise you end up franchising inconsistency.\n\nThe businesses I’ve seen do this well obsess less over growth tactics and more over making the best location impossible to mess up.",
