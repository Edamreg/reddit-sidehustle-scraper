      "selftext": "Not clickbait. Let me explain.\n\nI sell AI websites to local businesses. The method works. But I kept losing sales to one objection:\n\n\"What if I need to change something? I don't know how to edit websites.\"\n\nThey're scared of being stuck. Paying you for every small edit.\n\n**The Google Sheet trick:**\n\nConnect the website to a Google Sheet.\n\nThey open a spreadsheet. Change their hours, prices, services, images. Site updates automatically.\n\nNo code. No developer. Just a spreadsheet they already know how to use.\n\nThis one trick increased my close rate by 30%.\n\n**The full method:**\n\n1. Google Maps → find businesses with no website or garbage sites\n2. Build them a site with AI (bolt.new, lovable - free)\n3. Connect it to a Google Sheet\n4. Record a 30-second video walkthrough\n5. Send: \"your SEO score is low, built you a new one, here's a quick tour\"\n6. Attach the video. Not a link. The actual file.\n\n**Best niches:**\n\nDentists, plumbers, car detailers, cleaners, landscapers, personal trainers. Anyone where you reach the owner directly.\n\n**What I charge:**\n\n$500-$1000 per site. One-time.\n\n**The math:**\n\n* 50-100 outreach/day\n* 30% reply rate\n* 10% convert\n* 1-2 sales/day\n* $10k-$20k/month\n\n**What I do now:**\n\nAutomated the whole thing. One prompt handles scraping, site building, video, outreach.\n\nBut the Google Sheet is what closes the deal.\n\nHappy to answer questions.",

My brick and mortar business receives at least 15-20 emails every week offering seo, web design, financing and every possible service you could imagine.  The way it works in the web design is indians jump on all the working methods first then burn them out.  Then all other third world countries catch up and pick up breadcrumbs. By the time any decent method makes it to the open public it's wore out and exhausted. \nAnd what happens with this method is in theory this system works.  But in reality it doesn't.  For one - nobody is buying anything from random strangers who reached out via email. They just don't. And the only way to make money in this \"business\" is to sell tools with ephemer promises of gold mines to desperate people without imagination - much like the shovel sellers did during a good rush.  So what the op does is sell you the gold digging shovel . He puts the twist on his own method, posts the subtle sales funnel and hopes that there would be 20(or more) fools who would fall for those crazy numbers dangled in front of them who would send him a pm.  Then out of those 20, 4 would buy his automation \"shovel\" and 1 end up not charging back. \nDon't be a fool.

There's no skill you can learn in a month that reliably pays $1k/month. Most of this is compounding over time. You have to go into it accepting it might not work in 1 year, maybe not even 2 - but in 5 years it will.\n\nIt's that saying \"People overestimate what they can do in 1 year and underestimate what they can do in 10\"",

I’ve tried flipping things online and didn’t have a whole lot of luck. I guess what I’m looking for is an online side hustle that isn’t a full time commitment that I can do on my own time? I don’t really have too many skills I can make money off of. I’ve considered doing food delivery services but the idea of driving to random people’s houses makes me a little nervous. Any suggestions?

Quick little surveys, and immediate payout (once daily) through Venmo when you reach $6. I would spend spare time here and there doing studies throughout the day and usually avg about $10/day. Not a lot, but it adds up. DataAnnotation is another one I spent a large amount of time doing. I actually made $28k two years ago on that, but they can be tough to deal with and it is sporadic. PulseLabs is another one I use regularly.\n\nI’d recommend you spend your spare time on building an asset though, that will generate passive income for you. What are your interests, hobbies, etc.? What excites you? You have expertise in something. You may not feel you are an expert, because there are always others more knowledgeable, but surely people ask you questions about something you have knowledge about. Build a niche around it, get a system in place, feed it every now and then, and let it grow and return revenue to you going forward while you sleep.",

I wanted something I could manage in short pockets of time from home.\n\nWhat made it work for me is how simple the setup is once you understand the flow. eBay already has buyers, so I’m not running ads or doing marketing. I don’t keep inventory or ship anything myself. Most days it’s just checking for orders, placing them, and replying to a message or two. After the learning phase, it becomes pretty mechanical.\n\nAt the start it does take effort because you’re learning and making small mistakes, but once things click, it stops feeling like a second job. I can handle a lot of it from my phone when I have downtime.\n\nThe biggest value for me wasn’t even the money at first. It was realizing I didn’t need to trade more hours for extra income. I just needed a simple system I could run without stressing myself out.\n\nIt’s not passive and it’s not for everyone, but if someone wants something boring, repeatable, and realistic alongside a normal job, it’s been solid for me.",

          "body": "First thing i see wrong is \"Took a $300 website job\". You're a developer with a certain skill set. Don't take jobs. A plumber or electrician doesnt say ok you called me and im gonna do this job for you based on what you want to pay me. They show up and investigate the situation then give you an estimate.  You gotta work on not being over eager and treat every customer like they have the money to afford your skill set. It's up to them to decide if they can or they can't. \n\nThis is where discovery time comes in. A consultation. Talk through the project. Discuss barriers that may exist. Then you work out an itemized invoice for the work. Put those details in your contract a long with your time lines, expectations for payment and any Terms and Conditions that you have set for your freelance business. \n\nTake some time to set some baseline prices for yourself. If a client wants a landing page what all does that entail? Are you providing domain hosting, email accounts? Will you have to come up with the page copy on your own. Will you have to source images? Will you be offering maintenance? Will you be providing on page SEO with the copy? \n\nTheres not a single instance for me that i would accept $300 to build a landing page. It's too important for them and requires thoughtful planning if there will be no additional pages to follow. \n\nI also only build in wordpress and have all of the Pro features  for my builder and my widgets. \n\nI chose to handle my business one way, that lets people im very good and efficient at what I do. I take my business seriously and take their project seriously. It's our job to lead them to understand why your prices are what they are and that goes beyond your portfolio. \n\nI'd advise you to stop \"Taking Jobs\"  based on what they can pay and start setting your prices for yourself and what you need to be able to operate your business and live your life. \n\nThink about getting a CRM I use Honeybook its great. If someone has an issue with my prices, at that point and at my discretion i can offer breaking it into payments that they can handle. My only policy with that is Auto-Pay must be used for a payment plan. I will shut shit down if i dont get paid. \n\nNever had an issue. I build 30-50 page sites. It got easier getting those clients when i was able to present myself confidently as a business and i put in place a professional workflow. \n\nLesson learned. Good luck.",

I don’t care how “small” a job is, you always, ALWAYS need two things:\n1) an agreed upon and *signed* scope of work detailing what is included and how much it costs, (who is writing copy? How many revisions of copy? How many revisions of design? How many revisions of wireframes? Is there content? Who is providing it? Does the project include wireframes? How many sections? Who is providing imagery? Who is going to QA? What functionality is included? What is the expected timeline?Etc. etc.)\n2) a standard creative briefing document for your client to fill in that essentially becomes the “bible” of the project. It will outline the objectives, deliverables, target audience, give info on competitors, design req and spec, budget, schedule and timeline, how hosting and maintenance will be handled, expected outcomes, etc.\n\nI know all that seems like a lot, but once you develop a standard template, it’s extremely easy to populate AND will help you manage your time AND the client better, prevent scope creep, and enable you to ask for additional budget when scope creep inevitably happens",

YT content creation is also great but it's def not for starters and staying consistent on it is a bit harder than doing shortform ugc content. you can also do reselling by decluttering your own items first and sell it online and you can use tools like spadeberry and such to help you list items and price it to ebay.

      "selftext": "I’m a office worker, marketing role, nothing fancy. Most days by the time I get home, eat something random, and sit down, it’s already close to 9pm. That’s basically the only time I have for my own stuff.\n\nI’ve been trying to start a small side project for months now. Not some big startup dream, just a little online store idea I kept thinking about during work. The idea itself never felt that hard, it was always the starting that stopped me. Once I thought about hosting, themes, product pages, payments, I’d just close the laptop and scroll instead.\n\nLast week I finally forced myself to do something, even if it was messy. I told myself, one night, no overthinking, just try to get something online. So I basically just Googled how to start an online store, listed out the products I wanted to try, did a quick and very rough market check, and then used genstore to put together a store page. I don’t really know much about building websites, but while I was searching I realized a lot of this stuff can be auto generated now, so I just went ahead and made a rough first version instead of overthinking it. It wasn’t perfect. The copy needs work, product selection is probably bad, and I’m sure a real ecommerce person would roast it. But when I saw an actual storefront with my idea on it, at like 12:30am on a Thursday, it felt oddly motivating.\n\nI’m still figuring out whether this thing even deserves more time. But something about having a live site makes me more willing to keep going the next night instead of starting from zero again. \n\nSo if there’s a side hustle you’ve been thinking about, maybe don’t overthink it too much. Start while the excitement is still there, even if it’s not perfect, and adjust as you go. Really believe you’ll get something out of it.",

Around March 2025 I decided to organize what I was already reading into a simple format, mainly for myself at first, just to reduce the mental overhead.\n\nOver time a few people asked if they could follow along, so I kept it going. It takes around 8 to 10 hours a week and only works because I batch everything and stick to a routine. The first few months had almost no traction, but the structure itself was useful so I didn’t stop.\n\nMost of the early growth came from being helpful in relevant threads rather than sharing links. Narrowing the focus helped a lot. Things like Twitter and SEO never really worked for me. The biggest challenge now is keeping up with it alongside a full time job and figuring out whether it’s worth continuing to invest more time into it or keep it lightweight.\n\nCurious if anyone else here has turned something they already do daily into a side project and how you decided how far to take it.",

          "body": "My job is market research. Reputable companies should compensate adequately for the time involved but often the survey ends up longer than it should be. Better money is in qualitative research - focus groups (live or online) or individual interviews (usually online). Because we expect you to spend 30-60 minutes or more, compensation can be $100-$200 and it's more fun. \n\nBut - getting those opportunities depends on passing the screener survey, which depending on the client/product category, asks about product use and things like whether you have kids or cats, etc. Ex, if you don't have a cat it's pointless for us to get you in a discussion about your experience with cat food. \n\nThe easiest way to get survey projects (qual or quant) is to:\n\n1. Be in the demographic most companies want to sell to - usually 28-45.\n\n2. Sign up to be on a panel and fill out their forms on demoraphics, product use, lines/dislikes. You'll get more targeted screeners. Lots of research companies have panels and you can be in as many as you like.\n\n3. Participate in one of those apps where you scan your receipts. Often, those are owned by companies like mine who use the data from the receipt uploads to provide real info on sales and demographics to manufacturers and retailers. Data is provided in aggregate and clients aren't allowed to contact panelists. The US now has very strict privacy laws and we have to abide by them or risk a lawsuit that could put us out of business. Our lawyers will only let us work with clients who sign our PII agreements.\n\nThe value of doing this is that if the marketing research company has your verified purchase info the screening isn't as annoying. It's not as much of a fishing expedition to find the right respondents, don't have to send a ton of surveys to people who don't qualify, so you don't waste their time. \n\nBottom line - this is legit but not in any way a regular thing, not even a part-time job. Most companies have rules about how often they will send surveys to the same people because it's not in their interest to burn panelists out or talk to the same 1000 people all the time. \n\n I'm about to retire and if I was a panelist I would not get many survey invites because of my demographic. Also, if you don't consume a lot of stuff, you won't get a lot of survey invites either. The point of market research is to understand how to sell stuff to people who like to buy stuff! \n\nNote - I have never worked in political opinion polling so I don't know how that works or what they pay.",

      "selftext": "Posting this because one of my comments in another thread in this sub unexpectedly blew up and a bunch of people asked me how I ended up here. I thought it was a great opportunity to do an AMA, so here we are.\n\nMy story started as a management consultant in Canada during COVID. I worked at a lower mid market consulting firm, but the pay was honestly not great for the hours and the grind (carrot and stick) never really clicked for me.\n\nWhen Covid hit, I did what a lot of people did and tried to build something online. I did a bunch of research on Youtube and decided to I should launch a dropshipping business selling an ergonomic product. It failed for the many reasons a lot of you probably experienced. Supplier was unreliable, shipping was a mess cause of COVID, and I was learning Meta ads, Google ads, and ecomm operations all at once. Looking back, it was exactly what you would expect from a beginner trying to learn everything in real time and trying to master global supply chains during a global pandemic. Painful, but it forced me to actually understand paid traffic and conversion, which ended up mattering later.\n\nA few months after that, I came across a Twitter thread about local services booming. Plumbers, electricians, cleaners. People in trades making serious money. I brushed it off. We had just lived through COVID and the idea of strangers in homes still felt uncomfortable. Then a few days later I saw another tweet (gotta thank the Twitter algo for that or else I wouldn’t be where I am today). A girl my age sharing her story about running a remote cleaning business. No cleaning herself, just managing demand and cleaners. It sounded almost too simple, which made me skeptical. I DM’d her, we had a short back and forth, and she pointed me to a resource that made everything click and work for her. It was a course from an ex Wall Street guy who built and scaled his own remote cleaning business. I obviously did not buy anything right away. I had never bought a course in my life and was still in the mindset of having to do more research and “If he did it, I can figure this out myself”. That said, I signed up for their free content and started reading the emails. The free content and emails broke the model down in a way that made it click + paired with my own research I understood this was legit and not some other online business trap. I eventually bought the course. I am not going to promote it here, but I do want to give credit where it is due. The material and the free 1:1 calls that came with the course with the person running it genuinely changed the trajectory for me from that point on.\n\nThings moved fast. It took me about 20 days to set everything up. In hindsight, it could have taken a week. I am naturally skeptical, and skepticism is the enemy of action so I kept double checking things, doing extra research, and trying to disprove the model and what was being taught. Ironically, the more I did that, the more I realized how simple and underserved the cleaning market actually is and how all the steps make perfect sense.\n\nChoosing a market to open up shop in ended up being straightforward. The rule of thumb is pretty simple: avoid massive cities like Miami or LA. Too competitive, too many sophisticated players, lots of illegal labor. Focus on smaller cities and towns with decent population and income (there are A LOT of them). Anything under 1 million people is great, closer to 500k is ideal. The idea is to be a big fish in a small pond. As part of the selection framework you should also be looking for markets where the biggest cleaning company barely has a functional website and maybe 30 Google reviews mot. Once you find a market like that (there are plenty), you then show up with a good brand, modern looking website with online booking, and great client experience.\n\nPersonally, I picked a market and have never expanded outside of it because demand still feels endless. Cities with high rental turnover are especially good. Student towns with colleges are gold. Landlords do not clean themselves. They will pay $400 to 600 for move out cleans without hesitation. Even today, about 20-30% of our monthly revenue comes from moving related cleans. Higher ticket, easier to execute since homes are empty.\n\nFinding cleaners is usually the biggest bottleneck and the only real stress you’ll have throughout your journey. You almost always have more demand than supply, which is a GREAT problem to have, but turning down clients because your cleaners are all too busy strings. In reality, it was a me problem because I was not approaching it well. I was relying only on job boards but once I started posting in local Facebook groups, I unlocked A LOT of new applicants and found several awesome teams that allowed me to scale. A piece of advice I am very glad I did follow though was hiring cleaners before launching any ads. Finding clients was the moment where everything became real. The first two cleaners I hired are still with me today. I have always been extremely selective during the hiring process, which is what I was taught to do, and that felt uncomfortable at first, but is the right thing to do. Once you stop trying to rush this step and find the best channels for your local market, the whole thing becomes much smoother.\n\nWe landed our first client on the first day we launched ads. A biweekly client paying $140 booked online. I remember being nervous dispatching the first cleaner, waiting to see if something would go wrong. Well.. the clean went great! Payment processed after the clean and I personally called the client, thanked them, and asked for a 5-star review, explaining we were early and it really helped. He left one and has been a client ever since. He is grandfathered into that pricing forever. I will do almost anything to never lose him because of how symbolic that first full loop was.\n\nThat first month we closed seven more clients, including a few one time deep cleans. At that point I was fully hooked.\n\nHere are my rough revenue numbers, month by month.\n\nMonth 1: 3.4k  \nMonth 2: 5.2k  \nMonth 3: 7.8k  \nMonth 4: 11.5k  \nMonth 5: 14.9k  \nMonth 6: 18.3k  \nMonth 7: 22.1k  \nMonth 8: 26.7k  \nMonth 9: 31.4k  \nMonth 10: 35.9k  \nMonth 11: 38.2k  \nMonth 12: 42.6k  \nMonth 13: 39.8k  \nMonth 14: 44.1k  \nMonth 15: 48.9k  \nMonth 16: 52.3k  \nMonth 17: 58.7k  \nMonth 18: 57.4k  \nMonth 19: 55.2k  \nMonth 20: 55.0k\n\nRoughly 60% of revenue is recurring. The rest are one time deep cleans or post renovation cleanups (we got into this a few months in). We do 0 commercial right now. I want to add it this year because higher ticket recurring contracts could realistically double the business.\n\nAbout 4 months ago, I hired my first virtual assistant in the Philippines. It took about a month to fully onboard and train her. She now runs the day to day operations (not easy to “let go” but 100% worth it). I spend about an hour a day on the business, sometimes less because I only step in for rare edge cases, escalations, or when she has a question (we just text). That was the moment the business truly felt passive and not just location independent in theory. Having a high % of my business being recurring helps with the transition as things are already rolling.\n\nTwo mistakes I made early on: 1)  I underestimated how much Google reviews matter. I automated review requests and it worked, but once I started personally following up with texts and occasionally calling clients, reviews grew much faster. We were already ranking top 3 locally due to low competition, but reviews massively increased organic bookings. 2) I waited too long to raise prices. Early on I was uncomfortable charging over $50/hr. Once I realized I had more demand than supply, I raised prices to an effective $60-65/hr depending on the job. Almost no negative impact. Demand kept coming in.\n\nHappy to answer anything.\n\n  \nEDIT: Cleaners are all independent subcontractors. I have 0 employees on payroll. They bring their own equipment and supplies (which is factored into their rate which is far above market).",

I wanted to address one question that came up most often:\n\nWhat if the market I'm interested in already has a bunch of players with decent websites and a bunch of reviews?\n\nThe answer is that it doesn't matter. Just avoid shitshow markets like New York or LA. This market is so big that demand feels never-ending. There are countless cities and towns across the US or whatever country you're located in. If you're the number 10 player in the market and you're making $40k or more in revenue a month, well, who cares? You're literally making $40k or more. Ideally, you want to find a market that is underpenetrated, but trust me, most of the companies that have over 100 reviews with a decent website and running operations making over $2M are operated by amateurs or people that are not even picking up the phone half the time. Also, they have A LOT of overhead so far less flexibility and margin to play with than we do. The opportunity is endless, just execute marginally better than them and you will take market share VERY quickly.",

But I wonder, have you thought about expanding to other locations to expand the business? \n2. How do you hire cleaners? Ads? Job portals? Facebook groups? \n3. What kind of clients bring the most business and are easiest to work with? Which channels are bringing them for you? \n4. I would love to also know about the course. Although i’m a bit skeptical like you and thinking of looking at youtube first and perhaps ChatGPT as an assistant in setting it up. \n\nThanks so much for this post. You honestly inspired me to try this out. I feel like it is also applicable to other trade industries so I can always pivot in case it doesn’t work or gets automated with AI/robot cleaners. \n\nI know you probably get a lot of DMs but I if you find the time, would love to get the course to start working on it. \n\nI’m really keen on starting my own business.

      "selftext": "So I have a small YouTube channel about home organization and decluttering, been doing it since like March last year. Making around $400-500 from adsense depending on the month, plus maybe another $150-200 from affiliate stuff. Not huge but pays for groceries.\n\nLike I did a video about organizing under the sink and it got 80k views, that one probably made me $200. But most videos get like 5-10k views.\n\nProblem is I spend like 10-15 hours a week filming and editing and im kinda burned out. My wife keeps saying I should post the same content on tiktok and instagram. She sends me tiktoks of other organization accounts like \"see they're making money, you should do this.\" Shes probably right but I really dont want to film everything twice. Also my youtube videos are like 12-15 minutes and nobody watches that on tiktok.\n\nBeen trying to repurpose content for the past 2 months and its kinda working but also kinda a mess. My workflow is all over the place. Sometimes I use Descript to pull clips, sometimes I just do it manually in CapCut cause Descript crashes a lot. Sometimes I use those AI avatar things for videos where I dont want my face, tried a couple like APOB and HeyGen but not sure if people think its weird. Sometimes I just use stock footage with my voiceover.\n\nSo far after 2 months:\n\n* TikTok: posted maybe 30 videos, got around 2k followers somehow, made like $45 from affiliate links\n* Instagram: posted 25 reels, got maybe 700-800 followers, made $30\n* YouTube Shorts: posted 20, complete waste of time, best one got 400 views\n\nThe annoying part is I still dont know what actually works. Some of my avatar videos do ok on tiktok, some flop completely. My real face videos are hit or miss too. Algorithm makes no sense.\n\nAlso im spending like 5 hours a week just repurposing stuff which defeats the whole purpose of trying to save time. Like yesterday I spent 3 hours trying to export a video and CapCut kept freezing. Almost gave up.\n\nFunny thing is my wife started posting the same content on her own account just using her phone and shes already at 5k followers in like 6 weeks. Meanwhile im here spending hours with all these tools making $45 a month on tiktok. She keeps laughing at me.\n\nNot sure if I should keep doing this or just focus on YouTube and forget the other platforms. Anyone else deal with this?",

Freelancing or small service businesses online, like basic SEO cleanups, customer support, or simple video edits, still pay if you get a couple steady clients. Marketplaces are noisy and you’ll see a lot of ghost jobs and recruiter spam, so build a tiny portfolio and pitch directly. If you just need something steady while you ramp up, wf​haler​t is a simple service that emails vetted remote jobs like data entry or admin work, less junk to wade through.

I think that has to be the reason you get into it, passion for something. People can grow quick and make money but generally that doesnt last long term because youll burn out from it.

Most of the noise you see about AI automation and microtasks is garbage designed to keep you poor. Real income is never passive when you start. It is active, painful work. If you want realistic results, you need to ignore the shiny objects.\n\nThe most reliable path is simpler than people admit. You need to sell a product that solves a painful problem. This can be software you promote as an affiliate or a simple digital guide you create. That is it. I wasted years jumping between dropshipping and crypto before realizing that boring businesses pay the best. You don't need a groundbreaking idea. You just need a boring system that works every day.\n\nPick one traffic source and master it. It will feel like you are screaming into the void for the first six months. That is the barrier to entry. Most people quit there. I built my entire income stream by focusing on email collection while everyone else was chasing viral dances. Build an audience, move them to an email list, and sell them something useful.\n\nDo not overcomplicate this. Focus on one thing until it works. The only reason people fail is that they get bored and switch lanes too early.",

Download the app \"Money Time\" from Google playstore next run the game \" sword slash\" and get as high a level as you can for more cash (I usually go about level 11 to 13 its easy) then you want to just sit your phone down while the game is playing make sure your phone screen timer is set as high as possible. Then you wait for as long as you want to collect money. 30 minutes for me makes $3 and while that doesn't sound like much I run this on 3 different phones and it makes bank. It aslso cashes out directly to PayPal and does so within like 10 seconds. Hope this is seen bro you'll thank me.

This is exactly what kills this business.  People fall in these traps, then are faced with friction, get overwhelmed, frustrated to finally quit prematurely because they didn't make a single dollar the first month when they were expecting 10K$.  \n\nWith such a bad experience, experience that was started with the wrong expectations, it's not surprising why so many beginners a considering \"passive income\" (nothing is truly passive by the way) business models such as affiliate marketing, to be scam. \n\nIf true, well, these gurus don't tell you how many years they were trying online without any income, the skills they most have acquired to build performance, the effort done, the huge audience they have grown with time. 10K$ is usually the results of a 1 month campaign backed with years of experience.\n\nThose gurus have all the merit for the effort, but not for promoting easiness that make a beginner to believe everyone succeed except him.",

What flopped was KDP low content, I got crushed by competition, and I’d never touch dropshipping again because of returns and payment holds.

          "body": "Coming from corporate finance you should actually have a really good leg-up in that you understand money better than the average Joe.\n\nMy main strategy is grid-trading. Without going into too much detail I focus on a top 20 crypto that  has pretty much stayed in the $12-30 range for the last few years. I have a bot that simply automates sales orders every time the price fluctuates 1.5%. This isn’t enough to replace my day job when you average out the good &amp; bad periods and even if it was I’d probably just divert that income to other investments for the time being but it’s enough that if I suddenly got laid off it would cover my bare minimum under realistic but bad conditions and potentially exceed my day job during short periods of high volatility.\n\nExtremely low effort and surprisingly high ROI but there is a fair amount of fluctuation due to the market plus the risk that it could all go to zero. Also a reasonable but respectable amount of capital is involved (think a year’s worth of salary).\n\n\n\n\nA shocking percent of people in the investing space have very little knowledge of accounting, forecasting, understanding financial ratios, hedging, etc so you could possibly create content to address that gap and get better returns by using “sweat equity” instead of cash to get the ball rolling.\n\nAt the end of the day though you have a few factors you gotta balance: time, capital, risk, and required returns. You can make a ton of money with little risk and little effort if you have a lot of money to start with,  can make a lot of money with little upfront effort if you are willing to lose it all, you can put in a ton of time and build something that will reward you down the road, etc.\n\n\nThere is no such thing as a free lunch so you gotta tweak the inputs to get where you are comfortable but passive income isn’t a myth but you do gotta temper expectations. It’s unrealistic to think that you can replace your day job with zero effort and $1k. But depending on how much effort &amp; capital you are willing to invest you can build a nice revenue stream.",

The game was good; it was noticed by the Play Store (4.5 stars) and I got several Google featuring (Editor’s Choice / Adventure). Whenever Google featured it, I saw a spike in downloads and sales. The features typically lasted from about a week to a month. As soon as the featuring stopped, I dropped back down to a very low number of sales.\n\nMy game was free-to-play (with ads), with a paid option (premium, no ads). Replayability was low (two things I would definitely change if I were to release a narrative game again). In short, the Play Store is extremely competitive — you get pushed out quickly in favor of new games. If I had managed to sustain $600 a week, I would have been the happiest developer.",

I pick the underlying stocks following a refining process that I'm still improving:\n\n1. Pick underlying stocks: I wrote a program to screen stocks based on some of my own formula and no earnings coming out before the expiration date (my formula calculates a value similar to IV so higher value implies higher premiums). Or sometimes I just pick the ones I'm more familiar with and repeatedly traded before;\n2. Further refining: Pick those with 1% - 1.5% biweekly premium. (Don't chase higher premiums and avoid pharmacy stocks. I've been bitten by those.)\n3. Then: Look at fundamentals. Select a few with good fundamentals or I'm confident / familiar with its financials.\n4. Next: Review technical charts and find the patterns that I like.\n5. Finally: ask Chatgpt if any meaningful events will happen before the expiration date (for example debt maturity). (Sometimes a future event will make the premium high)\n\nAt this point I'll have 3 - 5 stocks I'll sell CSP.\n\nI close or roll the position if I the stock falls to near or below the striking, or I have 80%+ profit, or the premium for the rest of the days is too low to hold. I very rarely get assigned.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. Don't chase high premiums.\n2. The game is in a way that you can win 10 times, but one loss could wipe most of the gains if not all, so need to be extra cautious with losing positions, epecially when the market is on a downhill where you have higher chance to loss.\n3. I trade in a margin account where my money is fully invested, and I use the margins to secure puts. The good thing is that you are not actually using the brokers money so it is interest free. So if you can boost your total return by a few percent with CSP that is still a win. The bad thing is that you have to be extra cautious with margins. I usually use a margin within 30% of my account value.",

Honestly, I was looking for for a software with AI that would suggest stocks to trade, but a tracker would be very helpful. I do weekly options.  I have been at it since 2020.  I always research the stocks and sell puts based on that.  Great comments on \"don't chase premiums\".  I have learned to fine tune how I do the strategy.  One comment for everyone.  I do this because it is fun for me and I make money.  However, this should not replace your 401K or your retirement savings.  This should be done with money you could afford to lose.  I know this sounds strange, but it is important to understand.  In reality it would be hard to lose all your money unless the company goes bankrupt.  I also spend like 30 minutes a day.  In my experience, it is hard to do this strategy with less than $50K.",

When you're running a side hustle, you can't afford variable per-second billing that spikes every time a user runs a complex prompt.\nWe spent the weekend migrating to Hypereal AI as a replicate cheaper alternative. \n\nThe main reason we switched was their credit system ($10 for 1k credits). It’s so much easier to calculate your \"profit per user\" when you know exactly what a generation costs, rather than guessing based on milliseconds of GPU time.\nIt’s been a solid replicate cheaper alternative so far no monthly \"vampire\" fees, and the API handles Flux and video models without the cold start lag we were getting before. If you're struggling to make your AI side hustle profitable, I'd highly recommend looking into a credit-based infra provider. It literally saved our margins.",

After 4 years of testing different side hustles, I’ve finally realized that the secret to success in 2026 is building high-value, low-friction digital products.\n\nSince I just had my first few sales on my breakdown today, I wanted to pass on 14 specific lessons I've learned to help you guys get a head start:\n\n1. **Solve \"Micro-Pain\" Points:** Don't solve a life problem; solve a 2-hour problem.\n2. **Prioritize Clarity over Length:** A 10-page guide that works is better than a 100-page book that is confusing.\n3. **The \"Coffee\" Price Point:** Selling for a low price is the \"sweet spot\" for impulse buys and building trust quickly.\n4. **Validation First:** Don't spend a month building. Spend 48 hours on a \"Version 1\" to see if anyone wants it.\n5. **Use \"Social Proof\":** Once you get your first sale, tell people! It shows your product is real and working.\n6. **Focus on Workflows:** Passive income isn't a \"set it and forget it\" magic trick; it's a repeatable system.\n7. **Organize your \"Digital Office\":** Separate your brainstorming time from your execution time to avoid burnout.\n8. **Build for 2026:** People want fast, actionable roadmaps, not long-winded theory.\n9. **Be Transparent:** If you use tools like AI to help you, be honest about it. Authenticity is a superpower on Reddit.\n10. **Community is King:** Provide 10x more value in comments than you do in your sales pitch.\n11. **The \"Loop\" over the \"Launch\":** Don't just launch and stop. Every customer question is a clue for your next update. Improving your product based on real feedback is what creates long-term passive income.\n12. **Own Your Traffic:** Don't just rely on one platform. Use social media to drive people to a simple landing page or email list. This way, you aren't at the mercy of an algorithm change.\n13. **Compound Your Assets:** One guide is a side hustle; five guides are a business. Once you find a workflow that works, repeat it for different \"Micro-Pain\" points in the same niche.\n14. **Focus on \"Evergreen\" Value:** Trends die fast. Solve a problem that people will still have 12 months from now. That is the difference between a quick buck and a steady income stream.\n\n**I've pinned the full 11-page breakdown on my Reddit profile for anyone who wants the deep dive (I put it there to keep this feed clean!).** I’m happy to chat in the comments if you have questions!\n\n**Note on this post:** I used AI to help me structure and write this post so that it is easy to read and the information is presented clearly for everyone.\n\n*(Disclaimer: The link on my profile leads to my personal digital product for beginners).*",

Most people make it sound like if you’re not rich by 25 you’ve failed, but that’s just not real life.\n\nOP, the average business owner actually starts around 40. Social media loves pushing the young rich outliers because it gets clicks, not because it’s normal. You genuinely have time. The good thing is you’re aware of it and you’re trying to change things. That already puts you ahead.\n\nIf I had one suggestion, it would be to put as much time as possible into learning. But not learning what you think you should learn. Learn what actually energizes you. That matters more than people admit. I found a bunch of resources along the way too, like this newsletter https://wealthrewired.beehiiv.com which helped me reframe how I thought about growth and time.\n\nAt one point I literally gave myself a learning budget. I let myself spend money on books, newsletters, courses, whatever helped me move forward. Amazon books, trends.co which was about $300 a year, theadvault.co.uk which is free. I didn’t care what the format was, I just needed momentum.\n\nFor context, my first job after college was in music after I ran out of money as a music producer and had to pivot. I was making about $35k a year in LA which was nowhere near enough to live. While working there I started experimenting with online businesses on the side. After some trial and error I had a couple small wins, then my company found out and didn’t like me building things on the side. I went back to work, hid my projects honestly, but kept going because I enjoyed it. Eventually I got good enough at coding to leave for a job I liked more, paid me double, and let me keep building side projects.\n\nI’ve felt lost more times than I can count. That feeling doesn’t mean you’re failing. Use it as fuel, keep learning, and stay focused on what actually pulls you forward.",

Unsubscribe and hit the three dots and select Don't Recommend Channel. Do not watch them. They're liars. Period.    \n    \nSecond, pick a thing and commit to it for *at least* a year. Anything you pick, you need to tell yourself \"Ok, I'm going to do this for a full year.\" I've certainly fallen into the \"it didn't work in the first couple weeks\" trap, and the problem with that usually is that you don't set a duration.      \n   \nIt's always    \n\"I'm going to to this and see what happens.\"   \nand not   \n\"I'm going to do this for a year and see what happens.\"   \n    \nMaking that mindset shift where you know how long you're in for is a huge help. Being 2 weeks in with no progress feels bad. Being 2 weeks in with no progress when you know you're committed to 52 weeks isn't a big deal because duh, you're just starting. Of course you're not seeing progress yet, and that's ok. You're going to keep going because you've barely scratched the surface.   \n    \nHonestly, if you cannot commit to doing one thing for a full year, don't even waste your time starting.",

          "body": "So many different options :) just try different ones and see if any get traction. What about offering a service in your town? I used to mow lawns on Saturday mornings and it was paying my mortgage every month. I set up a [Google business profile](https://business.google.com/en-all/business-profile/) in my town and that is where I received all of my leads. The Google business profile is cool because it’s free and if you work on getting good reviews you’ll probably out rank your competitors. People locally constantly turn to Google when they need a service. Something you could do is graphic design that specializes in logos and use ChatGPT, grok or Gemini to design them for you. You can get leads by making a google business profile for that as well and set up the primary category as “graphic designer”. Make sure you fill out the google business profile fully, so add photos, website, etc. If you’re worried that you don’t know how to build a website then use something like [Carrd](https://carrd.com), which is super easy to use and very cheap. Also, I read in newsletter [side hustle builders](https://open.substack.com/pub/sidehustlebuilders) that if you have a local garage sale/business facebook group for your town you could get leads that way too just by networking. Hope this helps!",

If you want legit remote job leads to practice applying, wfha​l​ert emails verified roles like entry level customer support or basic admin work, not all will fit a teen but it’s a decent way to spot real listings and see what skills they want.",

Well, that was before Apple had its way with it and now it’s only 69 cents but it’s something!\n\nIt’s been a big boost mentally, and if anybody is on the fence about shipping - just do it!!\n\nIf anybody is curious, the app is called **SpeakEasy** ([speakeasy-app.com](https://speakeasy-app.com)). I’m genuinely open to feedback, especially around the feature set and the UI. If anyone wants to try it out, I’d really appreciate it 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽\n\nHappy to answer any questions about the process or what I learned along the way.",

Also, I read in newsletter [side hustle builders](https://open.substack.com/pub/sidehustlebuilders) that if you have a local garage sale/business facebook group for your town you could get leads that way too just by networking. If you wanted to try something online then maybe you could do graphic design that specializes in logos and use ChatGPT, grok or Gemini to design them for you.

I don’t touch a single line of code.\n\n\nI’m basically a human \"editor\" for AI. I read through responses it generates and help refine them so they’re more accurate and conversational. \n\nIf you have a good handle on language and a sharp eye for detail, that’s really all the \"technical\" skill you need. They didn’t require any prior AI experience to get started, which was the big selling point for me.\n\n\nA few things I’ve appreciated so far:\n\n\n**Real Flexibility:** I log on when it fits my schedule. No one is hovering over my shoulder.\n\n**Low Barrier to Entry: **You just take a skills assessment in your strongest subject (like writing or general knowledge) to get started.\n\n\n**The Work Itself: **It’s actually kind of interesting to see how the \"brain\" of an AI develops based on the feedback you give it.\n\n\nIt’s been a great way to get into the tech space without having to go back to school for a CS degree.

It was a lecture for a college class, no one was mic-ed except the professor and he asked a lot of questions to the students. I had to determine the different students with only the audio, like if one answered more than 1 question i had to be able to recognize their voice. no video came with the audio. I submitted it several times and it was rejected for failing to properly identify speakers correctly, despite the otherwise accurate transcription of what was said. that was very frustrating.\n\nanother job involved a non-native english speaker with a strong accent.\n\nbasically, the starting jobs seemed to be the jobs the seasoned workers didn't want to touch. if i remember right, the more jobs submitted and the better the accuracy, the higher priority one could get for the easier to transcribe work.\n\nthe time required and the pay for that time wasn't really that good for someone like me, my typing average at the time was about 65wpm at 99% accuracy which i admit, isn't that impressive, basically the bare minimum needed for the jobs.\n\nif you are a fast and accurate typer, have good listening skills and hearing, it might be feasible if you stick with it. especially if you have and know how to use the foot pedal transcription things. you still might get work rejected however, sometimes for reasons that seem unfair or don't make sense. having a low rating at the beginning can prevent more work from becoming available.\n\njust my take on it, like i said, it was awhile ago and maybe they have changed. it is a legit company though. i did get paid. it was not easy and not much.",

But I’m also sharing this because I wasted months following bad advice and I see the same patterns here daily.\n\n  \n**TL;DR:** Low KD, random posts and backlinks didn’t move the needle. Topical focus + intent did.\n\n  \nI started exactly like most people here.  \nWatching YouTube, reading blogs, making spreadsheets of low KD keywords, thinking “if I just publish enough, it will work.”\n\nIt didn’t. Not for a long time.\n\nWhat actually happened:  \nI ranked for some keywords.  \nGot impressions.  \nEven got traffic.  \nAnd still… no meaningful results.\n\nThat’s when I realized a few uncomfortable things.\n\nFirst: **low KD doesn’t mean good keyword.**  \nSome of the easiest keywords I targeted were also the most useless. No buying intent, no urgency, no real problem behind them. On paper they looked great. In reality they were dead.\n\nSecond: **random content doesn’t build authority.**  \nI was writing about whatever keyword I found that day. One post about X, next about Y, next about Z. To me it felt like progress. To Google it probably looked like noise. Once I stopped and went deep on one topic instead of touching ten, things slowly started making more sense.\n\nThird: **backlinks didn’t save me.**  \nYes, links matter. But they didn’t fix weak content. They didn’t fix lack of structure. They didn’t magically make Google understand my site. Cleaning up internal links and covering subtopics properly helped more than most links I chased.\n\nFourth: **most AI content is painfully obvious.**  \nI tried it. It saves time, but it also produces very generic stuff unless you heavily guide it (yes, it is possible but needs really good knowledge). Google may index it, but it doesn’t seem to trust it. You still need real depth and specifics.\n\n  \nThe biggest shift for me was this:  \nI stopped asking “how many posts should I write”  \nand started asking “what is missing for someone trying to solve this problem?”\n\nWhen I used Search Console data instead of keyword tools, and built around what was already getting impressions, things became much clearer.\n\nIf you’re grinding and feel like SEO “isn’t working”, there’s a good chance you’re not bad at it, you’re just following advice that sounds good but doesn’t map to reality.\n\nI wish someone had told me this earlier. Posting so maybe it saves someone else a few months.",

          "body": "Andy Frisella has a power list system of doing just 5 things; action items each day. I started doing this in early 2017. My list usually is mostly business but some days there's family and personal items in that five.\n\nI write it down in a note book every night. Then, at the end of each day, I write win or loss. If you win enough days, you win the week. If you win enough weeks, you win the month. \n\nIt also gives me a journal of action items that I can go back and look at over the years. If I don't hit a quarterly goal or if a habit doesn't change in my personal life. I can take a look and see what I did each day in that time period.\n\nAnother aspect of building a business, they're people don't talk about is how easy it is to lie to ourselves. We try to make ourselves believe that busy is productive. Are you really moving the needle though? \n\nIt's the easiest form of discipline building i've ever implemented. Now there have been some dark nights of the soul so to speak throughout the last ten years. Where I don't wanna do anything. In those moments on those days I make myself get up and do something very uncomfortable.\n\nA couple weeks ago, we had a cold front come through Texas. Nothing major but colder than what we're used to. I live in a rural area, surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of acres. I think it said thirty five mile an hour winds that day but our wind gauge was hitting fifty plus. It was miserable outside.\n\nI'd made myself get up at 6:30 in the morning, because I usually sleep until I wake up naturally. I got dressed quickly, and I went out to the horses barn/shed. And got his bucket and I hiked back to the shop to fill it with feed and let it soak with warm water. I made myself stand outside in the cold wind for that ten minutes. Then, I hiked back out through multiple gates that I had to unlock and lock. Disengaging and reengaging electric fences. Gave the beast his bucket. When I hiked back through the gates and went inside. All in all, it took about thirty minutes.And I was cold.\n\nI jumped in a hot shower.Got dressed again for the day. Grabbed my backpack with my business stuff in it and I headed to my office. I didn't feel better but I was moving. I started into my list which I had purposely made very easy for the day. Knocked it out within about two hours. \n\nWhen you're done with your five things, you're done for the day. Myself included everyone always says, oh I can do twelve things or thirty things. Just do the fucking five things. \n\nI finished my five things and I went to sit on the couch in my office and just scroll the internet. Then, my phone rang with a new customer. Then, another, and another, and another, and another. Turns out, one of our competitors was bought out, and the new company's prices went up another thirty percent. I have no employees.I handle everything for my company and it's quite large. When a new customer contacts us, though I have to do all the onboarding, enter their order set up the financials and the emails and then pick their order pack their order and ship their order all before three p m.\n\nI was not in the mood or the mind state.To do this shit. I was done for the day. \n\nNow i've switched into a different phase, which is called test days.... Another Andy Frisella process. This is where your discipline kicks in. I knocked out all the orders on time.And then I went back to the office to tally up the financial. $17,356 in new sales in one day. That was a record.My previous record was $13k. Each one of these customers will re order every single month forever. I had just had the best day. I'd had in business in a long time and it was one of the worst days for me mentally.\n\nIf I had not of woken up early and done the horse feeding  before forcing myself to the office to knock out my powerlist, it would have been too late in the day for me to accomplish all three things. \n\nThat leads me to another belief that I personally have, is that I have a path. I'm on my path and as long as I stay on my path, things will work out.\n\nThose test days are The Times that you look back on for brief encouragement when you need it to reinforce your discipline.\n\nKnow this though, when you become successful, even though you're still dealing with this type of shit, weekly, people are gonna tell you that you must have gotten lucky to be as successful as you are.",

Or wont be good enough. This makes you feel demotivated. and most people thing just getting through the work will fix it. But Action without alignment is just a distraction. \n\nTry  Visualizing having achieved your goal. and feeling those emotions. if you feel like your not fully convinced you will achieve it. set a small goal that you KNOW you can do and visualize having already DONE that. these small actions compound, Maintaining these emotions will create the reality you want ,you will intuitively see the actions you need to take to make it real.

But psychology and structure are what save you when motivation tanks.\n\nWhat helped me:\n\n* I stopped working in isolation. I joined a business model where there’s community, shared systems, and mentorship, not just noise or pressure, but actual direction.\n* I built a rinse and repeat plan. No more waking up wondering what to post, who to talk to, or what needle moving even looks like.\n* I started measuring progress, not just results. Some days, showing up is the win. Especially when you’re still proving the model to yourself.\n\nYou’re not lazy. You’re just carrying too much without support and structure.\n\nAnd no, you’re not wasting time, you’re building resilience most people never touch.\n\nThat matters more than it feels like right now\n\nI just want you to know: you’re not broken. This is just the part no one posts about.\n\nKeep building. Even the messy days count",

It's not supposed to.\n\nWhat you're experiencing now is normal. It's the middle of the journey, where the excitement wears off and reality sets in. This is where most people quit. Not because they're not disciplined - because they're exhausted.\n\nThe \"just be disciplined\" advice is bullshit. You can't discipline your way out of building from the wrong place.\n\nHere's what helped me:\n\n**Stop asking \"am I motivated today?\"**\n\nStart asking \"why am I building this?\"\n\nIf the answer is external (prove something, hit metrics, look successful), you'll burn out. Because external goals keep moving. There's always another milestone.\n\nIf the answer is internal (this matters to me, this aligns with who I am, this serves something bigger), you'll find a different kind of fuel. Not motivation - purpose.\n\n**The mental side you mentioned?**\n\nThat doubt, that comparison, that \"am I wasting my time\" spiral - it's all coming from one place: you're building from pressure, not purpose.\n\nPressure to perform. Pressure to succeed. Pressure to prove you're not wasting your time.\n\nWhen you build from pressure, every low day feels like failure. Every slow week feels like proof you're not good enough.\n\nWhen you build from purpose, low days are just... days. Not evidence. Not identity.\n\n**Practically, what I did:**\n\n\\- Stopped checking metrics first thing (they controlled my mood)\n\n\\- Got clear on why THIS project, not just \"be successful\n\n\\- Set boundaries (work hours, offline time, non-negotiables\n\n\\- Found someone who'd been where I am, and five years ahead of me (coach, not just cheerleader)\n\nThe discipline people talk about? It's easier when you're building something that matters to you, not something you \"should\" be building.\n\nYou're not stuck because you lack motivation. You might be stuck because you haven't figured out if this is YOUR thing or someone else's idea of success. It's a lonely journey and sometimes you might lack the accountability, guidance, structure that you might have had before. That's ok to have.\n\nNot quitting is good. But also - ask yourself, am I building the right thing? Or am I just stubborn?\n\nThose are different questions.\n\nI also echo u/FatherOften on the 5 priority list items that no matter what, you action on.\n\nGood luck.

Think of it like an **LLM**: if you don’t provide clear **constraints**, the output is just high-speed hallucinations and chaos. That’s exactly what we do to our brains.\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\n* **Strategy vs. Busywork:** Being submerged in tasks isn’t 'grinding'; it’s a one-way ticket to Burnout City. If your strategy doesn’t dictate a lean action plan, you’re just throwing spaghetti at the wall and wondering why the wall is messy.\n* **The 'Void' Factor:** For a first-timer, entrepreneurship is a literal leap into the void. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed. Give yourself actual time to **somatize** the shift. A total identity overhaul takes much longer than we’re willing to admit, and you can't rush the biological clock of adaptation.\n* **Neuroplasticity is your gym:** The 'mental side' isn't just something to 'endure.' You’re using neuroplasticity to hardwire the habits of the person you want to become. This takes time, repetition, and a lot of recalibration.\n\n**TL;DR:** Stop adding tasks and start add better constraints. Above all, be supportive to yourself, you deserve it, even if only for the massive step you took by starting this journey on the first place.\n\nHope this helps and good luck!",

Like responding to emails at 11pm, hopping on calls whenever they wanted, basically being their personal support bot.\n\nMy retention was okay, around 65% after 6 months which isnt terrible but not great either. Then in October I had some personal stuff come up and I literally had to set boundaries. Started blocking out actual work hours, stopped responding to non urgent stuff after 6pm, and told clients upfront that I batch my communications twice a day.\n\nI was honestly scared theyd leave. But the opposite happened? My retention jumped to like 89% over the last 3 months. Clients seem happier, they respect the boundaries, and weirdly they value my input MORE now. I think because Im not constantly available Im forced to be more strategic with my responses instead of just reactive. Im working probably 15 hours less per week and somehow I've actually got some money set aside ($2.3k from Stаke) now which never happened before. Sometimes doing less is actually the move.",

When you’re always on, clients start to treat you like support instead of an expert. Putting structure around your time changes that dynamic and makes your input feel more intentional.\n\nBatching communication also forces better thinking. You’re not just reacting to every message, you’re responding with context and strategy, which is what clients are actually paying for. The retention jump kind of proves most clients don’t want 24/7 access, they want clarity and confidence.\n\nA lot of agency owners only learn this after burning out.

      "selftext": "I've been mentoring startups for many years now. Thought I'd share some advice over a few posts that I always end up giving new entrepreneurs starting out. Here's one:\n\nDo not quit your job! At least not right up front. You made up your mind to quit and start a company. Fantastic. My advice is not to quit your job to pursue your company full time until the last possible moment. While you are still working (and getting paid!) spend six months or so in the evenings planning. Get a team together, do your research, build a business plan, go another level deeper and get all of the detail of product development and the company administration planned out.\n\nBuild as much of your company as possible while someone else is footing the bill for your survival. I can't tell you how many times I've had this discussion and when I say this the founder hangs their head a little. My response - you quit your job already, didn't you? Founding a successful company is hard enough without putting the (unnecessary) added pressure of having to worry about survival money on the first day. Even if you've saved, why not use a continuing salary from your current job to get going.\n\nMore in future posts. Hope this helps some.",

      "selftext": "hi everyone, \n\ni've been building serviceorca with my team, a zero-commission marketplace for service providers. We launched in September 2025.\n\n  \nmy original go-to-market strategy was:\n\n1. launch in UAE then expand to US and then other countries.\n\n2. burn cash on ads to get plumbers/electricians etc to sign up.\n\n3. burn cash on SEO to rank for keywords.\n\n  \nthen the weirdest thing happened. In October and November we started seeing registrations from random places, like small towns in Europe, Asia, USA, UAE, Australia, etc. i assumed it was a spam bot, but the profiles were real service providers. \n\ni dug into referral traffic. it wasn't google search. it was AI.\n\n  \npeople and other agents were asked tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, perplexity, Claude, ... you name it: \"where can i list my service business for free?\" or \"alternative to Angi/Thumbtack with no fees\"  \nBecause my site was new, lightweight, and the value prop was clear (\"Free\"), the AI models picked it up and started recommending it as the primary answer. \n\n  \n**The result**\n\n* 5 years ago i would have needed a massive budget to get 1000+ worldwide verified listings.\n* Today, AI did the heavy lifting for free.\n\nI decided to pivot. i scrapped the \"US Only\" restriction. if AI wants to send me a carpenter from Berlin or a graphic designer from Tokyo, i'm taking them.\n\n  \n**The challenge now:** The \"Supply\" side (service providers) is scaling automatically thanks to AI. Now i have to solve the \"Demand\" side (customers) to make sure these pros actually get work. \n\nThings are growing slowly, but surely, and i see the progress over there. \n\nI'm curious if anyone else has stumbled into this sort of \"accidental\" traction recently? To be clear, i don't consider this \"success\" in the traditional sense yet - we aren't huge, and we still have a mountain to climb regarding revenue and daily active users. But as a first step, having AI drive our initial user base for $0 feels like a fundamental shift from the old playbooks. If you've had similar small wins or weird AI- driven growth stories in these early stages, i'd love to her them. ",

Just New York alone is a crazy big market to build significant local traction for a single services category to be remotely interesting to the buyer side. Your AI just created a huge problem where you have to get A) millions and millions of listings to be interesting enough in just one city and B) get world wide consumer traction.\n\nIn my opinion AI already totally messed up your directory and you might have to start over again. These  marketplaces work if you have at least one category, in one single city figured out well.\n\nIts a bit the same as when you let your META ads just focused on lead volume, often you only get volume of the shittiest possible leads.

Two years of working till midnight most nights. My wife basically didn't see me. When I sold, she was mostly just relieved I'd have evenings again.\n\nSo yeah, keep the job if you can. But don't underestimate how hard it is to do both for years. It's not sustainable forever.",

Three of my long-term clients decided to retire early and close their business because the impacts of tariffs made their business no longer feasible.

None of your friends have become doctors, and hardly even nurses after two years.\n\nWhat do you mean you've always been an entrepreneur at heart? you just started your adult life.\n\nI don't want to give life advice, it's all about you and how you want to live your life.  If you really have entrepreneurial spirit this is most likely what you should explore. If you want to be a doctor as well, be an entrepreneurial doctor. Become a dentist and aim for a chain of dental clinics. Become a surgeon and instead of curing people fill up their boobs, or much easier, just spend your days injecting some tiny amounts of liquid into their lips and muscles for massive profits. You can be passionate about heart surgery yet invent a non existing procedure or device and make millions upon millions, and you can do that probably do similar in almost any medical specialty.\n\nNurses? overworked and probably underpaid. Doctors? mostly very busy, stressed, have no life, and probably therefore even if well paid are underpaid, since they have no life and are literally giving their life away to the job.\n\nYou quite simply need to decide what you want to be and how your want to live, and what kind of lifestyle you want in the future.\n\nSo what if your first business is failing or failed, or your second or third. If and when you make it, you could retire while watching your peers give their lives away for \"good pay\" and status, but literally having no life. However, you could also keep on failing forever, or at least not making it the way you want to and they took over in any way that you consider as a success, be it home ownership, an expensive car, a trophy wife, or whatever else people compare themselves with, with their peers.  None of that is a guarantee of any degree of happiness. In fact I guess most people are unhappy, frustrated or jealous in some shape or form.  Life and your choices are filled with risks, and you need to be able to live with your choices.\n\nYou are right to start thinking about this early, however, you need to always be vigilant and decide what is best for you, and what your path is, and be flexible at allowing yourself to make a change at any moment.\n\nTry to look far into the future, and think where you REALLY want to go.",

Google &amp; LinkedIn Ads: as I said, \\~60% of our customers come from Google and LinkedIn ads! We spend about $7k combined every month! LinkedIn is slightly more expensive but we have basically hit the ceiling on Google alone unfortunately!\n2. Conferences:  We send someone from our team to most present at extremely specific industry conferences! I guess about 10% customers come this way\n3. Cold emails: We have setup Clay recently to automatically do cold outreach based on our ideal customer persona both via email and linkedin! The outreach is basically to book a sales call! About 10% customers come this way\n4. SEO: Since we already get customers from Google ads, it made sense to invest in SEO as well to ideally get some organic traffic without ads! We have setup an automation using AI tools like Frizerly to use our Google search data to automatically publish a highly specific blog on our website on relevant keywords! About 10% of customers come this way when they search these keywords on Google!\n5. Communities &amp; Reddit: Last but not least, we have used tools like F5B etc to setup alert on specific keywords all across reddit and few niche online communities and we usually join the conversation, provide value and subtly plug our product  in about 10% of the conversions! Again about 10% of customers this way!",

That works, but it hits a ceiling fast. What’s worked better for us is helping the right people realize they even have a problem before they’re in buying mode. Content and real examples have done more than ads there.\n\nOne thing I didn’t expect: founder-led stuff works really well. People don’t trust brands that much, but they do trust people. Sharing honest takes, lessons learned, even mistakes in places like Reddit or smaller communities builds trust surprisingly fast.\n\nWe also stopped trying to make broad content. Generic blog posts didn’t move anything. Very narrow, very specific content for one clear ICP did.\n\nCold outbound still works too, but it’s way better when it’s not actually cold. If someone has seen your content or recognizes your name, replies go up a lot.\n\nOverall, what’s worked best is just showing up where our ICP already hangs out, talking about the problem, sharing what we’re seeing, and helping.

In my experience, the next channels that actually convert tend to be things like outbound (email or LinkedIn) once the ICP is clear, and content that’s tightly tied to the buying problem, not generic thought leadership.

At 23 I was hitting numbers that looked great from the outside. But internally I was constantly stressed, exhausted, and close to burning out. Not because the business was failing, but because I had built it in a way that worked against who I actually am.\n\nI was showing up in sales calls, client conversations, and daily work in ways that didn’t feel authentic. It felt like I had to perform a version of myself every day. Over time that creates a huge mental tax, even if things look “successful” on paper.\n\nThe hardest realization for me was understanding that you can build something profitable that still drains you if it’s misaligned. I spent years thinking the heaviness was just part of the grind. Only later did I see that the business itself was designed wrong for me.\n\nWhat I’d do differently much earlier is design the business around how I actually want to work, communicate, and think. Money matters, obviously. But being able to wake up and say “this feels like me” matters more long-term. That shift alone removed more stress than any revenue milestone ever did.",

      "selftext": "I’m going to share a story with you about how the company I work for actually started, before it was a proper SaaS.\n\nNot the founder, not the dev. I work close to product and growth at a SaaS that turns Google Maps into usable lead lists. Seeing the \"behind the scenes\" here has been a serious reality check.\n\nBefore there was an automated platform, the founders were coming off a failed project. They were burned out from building features that looked great on paper but didn't sell. So for this new idea, they made a simple rule: Don’t code. Just sell.\n\nFor the first few months, the product was just a manual service. They found people who needed local business data, and when someone asked for a list, they ran scripts manually on a laptop. They cleaned the Excel files by hand, line by line, and sent them via email with a simple PayPal invoice.\n\nIt sounds counter-intuitive for a tech company, but this manual grind is exactly what saved the business. If the data was wrong, the customer complained instantly. They didn't need to analyze user behavior to know what was broken, they felt it in the inbox. It also proved that people weren't paying for a slick tool, they were paying for the result. If a customer is willing to wait 24 hours for a manual email, you know you have a real business. Plus, those early sales literally funded the first months of actual development.\n\nThe automated dashboard was only built once the manual work became physically impossible to handle.\n\nThe lesson from inside the machine is clear: The SaaS was built to scale a solution that already worked, not to try and find a problem with a shiny UI. If what you’re doing right now feels ugly, slow, and unscalable, you’re probably exactly where you need to be.\n\n**🛡️ Authenticity verified:** this content is based on real-world data and real-world events involving real people.

          "body": "This is such a real post and honestly refreshing to read.\n\nThe \"don't code, just sell\" rule is harsh but it makes you face the only question that matters: will someone actually pay for this? Not would they maybe use it if it were free, but will they literally give you money.\n\nWhat gets me is how the manual process wasn't just validation, it was education. Every angry email about bad data, every question about what fields they needed, every \"can you also include...\" request. That's signal you just can't get from analytics or surveys. You're learning what the product needs to be because you're doing the work yourself, feeling every problem firsthand.\n\nThe timing thing is huge too: \"The automated dashboard was only built once the manual work became physically impossible to handle.\" Most founders do the opposite. They build the whole thing before knowing if anyone wants it. By the time you're drowning in manual work, you know exactly which parts to automate first because you're living the pain.\n\nThere's also something powerful about being willing to do unscalable things. It shows early customers you're serious, that this isn't just a side project that might disappear. Someone who will manually clean a spreadsheet at 11pm to get you your data actually cares about solving your problem.\n\nOne thing though: this works great for services where the value is immediate and tangible, like data or clear results. It's trickier for products where the value is in the tool itself or needs network effects. But even then, the core idea holds. Find the simplest way to deliver the value and see if anyone actually cares.",

          "body": "Interesting story, and a great lesson in focusing on real customer demand before over-engineering. I can imagine that initial manual grind felt quite demoralising at times, but it turned out to be the exact path your founders needed.\n\nYou're right that sometimes the \"ugly, slow, and unscalable\" stage is actually the most valuable. When you're so close to the problem, it's easy to feel like the solution has to be sleek and automated from the start. But those early manual workflows are often where you surface the true pain points and prove there's a market.\n\nIf this feels like the current phase for your product, I'd encourage you to lean into it. What specific aspects of the manual work are the most illuminating? Where do customers seem most engaged or frustrated? Observing those raw interactions can give you invaluable insights that may get lost once things are fully automated.\n\nJust remember to pace yourself. Avoid the temptation to over-optimise before the core foundation is solid. As long as you're learning and getting paid, the \"ugliness\" is a feature, not a bug. What's one small step you could take next to make that manual process just a little bit smoother?",

That’s a perfectly valid choice.\n\nI’m talking about founders who want to leverage **talent**, **capital**, **infrastructure**, and **speed**.\n\nWe tend to underestimate the value of being born or operating in Western countries nowadays. Yes, there is a lot to criticize and improve, no system is perfect, but the legacy you inherit is invaluable.\n\nWhen a founder operates with a team, efficiency matters. You don’t have time to constantly deal with:\n\n* people not being punctual (and it being “normal”)\n* deadlines not being respected (and it being “okay”)\n* feedback not being taken seriously\n* lack of accuracy and accountability\n\nIn many Southern countries, people are raised in environments where predictability is not a priority. A predictable environment with fewer frictions and fewer surprises is something many people in Western cultures take for granted.\n\nAs a founder, you end up wasting an enormous amount of energy on things that are **not core to your business**.\n\nThe hardest part is this:\n\nSome people accept this as “part of the culture” and don’t want to improve it, because changing it feels like betraying their identity and you are the one told you’re taking things too seriously.\n\nI know this is a sensitive topic, and I’m not trying to generalize or stigmatize anyone.\n\nBut as a founder, you don’t have the luxury of failing because of things that have nothing to do with your product, your market, or your execution.",

Entrepreneurship is wonderful, but you have to follow a path full of strategies. And that's quite complicated, haha, because you don't always win. And when I say win, I'm not talking about competitors, because over time you realize that your competitors are actually your partners, haha. It's crazy. Because there are days when you'll only have \"water\" to survive and there are days when you'll have a \"banquet.\" The entrepreneur is always in the worst situation, because the objective is first and foremost their organization.\n\n\nNote: I am an entrepreneur in the technology sector and also a PhD in entrepreneurship. And do you know what the secret is? You must persevere. Change your product, but don't give up. However, if I were to tell you what I intend to specialize in from now on, it would be in manufacturing products and the financial market. Oh, and choose a partner who is resilient to loss. That's important. They also need to be strong enough to handle your yelling. Yes. A fragile partner won't do.

      "selftext": "At the start of 2025 I got into an online business model. For months I was just learning, watching videos, studying etc. I’ve always been better at talking than doing, but I really did understand the model inside and out.\n\nBy September I finally took the leap and it actually worked. Within two weeks I was earning, and in November I made over $20,000. For the first time I felt like \"oh damn im actually gonna make it\"\n\nBut then I messed up... I lost more than half of it because of a platform policy violation. Honestly, I could've avoided it but it is what it is.\n\nAround the same time, a guy I’d been talking to since February basically disappeared from my life. We had over 100k messages between us and talked every single day about this business. He started building a tool, I helped him, and we became partners. I genuinely thought we were building something together. Then he found loopholes in our contract and cut me out to work with someone else.\n\nSo within a few weeks, I lost a lot of money and someone I thought had my back.\n\nI’m 18 and still live with my parents. I pay my share of the bills and I have enough saved to get through 2026 without a job, so I’m not in danger or anything. But mentally, I’ve been stuck. I wake up around 1pm, watch YouTube, play games, tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve fixed a few small habits, but I just can’t get myself to actually work again.\n\nAt night it’s worse. I stay up until 3am because when I try to go to bed I either feel lonely or my brain won’t shut up. I do have a girlfriend, and honestly, all I want long term is to be able to provide for her one day. That’s what drives me deep down. But right now, I just feel like I lost my momentum and don’t know how to get it back.\n\nI’m not looking for hustle clichés or “just grind harder” advice. I’m just wondering how people get themselves moving again after losing money, trust, and confidence all at once.\n\n**TL;DR:** Built an online business at 18, made good money, lost most of it due to a mistake, then got cut out by a partner I trusted. Now I’m stuck, barely working, sleeping badly, and trying to figure out how to start again.",

Not because you need it or you're out of shape or anything, because it will help focus some of your energy, and I'm sure you got some angst built up. Put all that to good use and start lifting weights, do it for 90 days and see how you feel. \n\nIt won't really change anything, but I promise you will feel better. Cardio is good too, I just lift, it helps so much just a lift heavy, makes you feel really good afterwards. Do it everyday, because every day you will get a boost from it. Try to do it first thing in the morning, but just do it every single day even if it's not like a huge thing. I spend about 30 to 45 minutes in the gym everyday, it ain't life-changing, it's enough to boost me through the day. \n\nBetter than any drugs I ever tried.",

One biggest advice I would give for your situation to stop pushing yourself in doing what you can't. You have to build actually discipline from here on. I'm assuming that it's been a good amount of time since your lifestyle has gotten worse. So to fix it, you have to fix the environment first. You don't have to change everything at once or keep a separate time for \"work\". My real advice is to change the place where you live. If possible, just move to another room with a different kind of setup which is minimal. With a new environment, your brain would allow you to let go of current habits and allow you to build new good ones. If you can't change your room, just change the place of furniture. Just make a change. That could also mean minimalising your room by removing unnecessary things. Regardless, best wishes!",

It's not just about the bold moment of launching - it's about the daily courage to:\n\n* Make decisions with incomplete information\n* Pivot when your original vision isn't working\n* Have difficult conversations with co-founders, employees, or investors\n* Keep pushing through the \"messy middle\" when the excitement fades but success hasn't arrived yet\n* Stay authentic to your mission even when shortcuts seem tempting\n\nThe entrepreneurs who make it aren't necessarily the ones with the perfect idea or the most funding - they're the ones who have the courage to adapt, learn from failure, and maintain conviction in their vision even when others doubt them.

These increased marketing activities are very mentally taxing for me.\n\nAs a way to wind off, I like to play games. Particularly, Dota 2. A game I used to play 20 years ago, one I still enjoy.\n\nThis leisure time is one of the things that helps me unwind and not think about the business after I've drained my battery on it; any other input in business would be unproductive.\n\nHowever, I found that the morning after playing a few games, I feel even more mentally fatigued. I assume this is because I've exhausted 100% of my mental capacity, and then a gaming session, which pushes it to 110% or more, draws on reserves from another day.\n\nMy dilemma is that, for me, games are one of the best ways to unwind and not think about the business. But games are also what drain my energy for the business.\n\nI wanted to ask you, entrepreneurs who also enjoy gaming: how do you approach this? Did you just quit gaming, or how did you reorganize your time?",

It shuts your brain off from work, yeah, but it does not let it recover.\n\nWhat clicked for me is there are different types of off. Anything competitive still hits the same mental system I need for work. So I didn’t quit gaming, I just boxed it in hard. No ranked. No long sessions. And never on nights before heavy days. Sounds boring but the next day fog mostly disappeared.\n\nSwapping some sessions helped too. Walking with music. Light gym, not chasing numbers. Even mindless YouTube. Feels less satisfying in the moment but you wake up way clearer.\n\nTiming matters a lot. Gaming when you’re already mentally cooked is the worst combo. If I play now it’s earlier in the evening, strict stop time, and not every day. Maybe two or three times a week. Otherwise it leaks into tomorrow exactly like you described.\n\nI don’t think quitting gaming is the answer. It’s more accepting that some games are mentally expensive and you have to budget them like energy, not time. Business drains you, Dota drains you, stacking them back to back overdrafts tomorrow.\n\nAlso random thought. Intense games wreck sleep quality even if you fall asleep fine. That alone can explain the morning fatigue.\n\nShort version. Keep gaming, just treat it like caffeine. Nice, useful, enjoyable, but wrong dose at the wrong time messes you up the next day.",

I’d rather play solo or with others because they take that shit way too seriously to the point of getting toxic. The games themselves are pretty tense.\n\nThat’s why I got myself a VR headset and been cycling through some of the best VR games and trying out some old classic. Right now I’m doing Doom 3. Another positive about VR is that I don’t normally do more than 40-60 minutes because it gets a bit headachy after hours, unless maybe if you’re used to it. This gives me the break I need, to get back to work.\n\nI balance it out with exercise, and taking family out somewhere. Through the years, when I really was feeling mentally down, I would go on for runs. Eventually ran about 10-12 miles a few times. It helped understand that sometimes I tell myself I’m tired and done, but I could always can push a little further. That had a positive effect on other metal activities. Now I have a walking treadmill, kettlebells, dumbbells, pull up bar and a bench.\n\nWe should hop on some game some time. Maybe you’ll be able to help me out with marketing.",

E.g. person who rings up drink isn't person who makes them. Person who makes them, only makes drinks with tickets. \n\nNow you need 2 people to run a scam...still happens but way more coordination needed and easier to spot.\n\nWhen you see corporate restaurant bartenders with all those tickets...it's not because they can't remember, it's to ensure things are rang in properly. \n\nThat being said...finding ways to take care of regulars goes a long way but stuff like remembering their name or something about them is way more impactful than a free $5. The \"extra\" espresso shot on a Monday or \"baked good\" that's going to be \"thrown away\" is more meaningful than free esp if it feels they are the only one.\nLoyalty cards work but aren't as good a real loyalty via service/hospitality",

Apparently shed been creating drama and making their shifts miserable but I was so focused on the customer facing stuff I didnt see it.\n\nThe pocketing cash part is clearly theft, but the rest sounds more like custom &amp; culture. For example, I've never worked in a restaurant where we didn't get free pop &amp; a shift meal. That was never tracked and I'm sure a shift meal went out some someone's friends now &amp; again, but the owner kept a hawk's eye for abuse of the privilege.\n\nWe don't really do annual reviews like a lot of larger places do, but we do have regular cost of living increases for staff. When I sit them down to discuss that, at the very end I ask if they have any comments/concerns/complaints/frustrations/pain points/whatever with their job or the business, in general. I make it clear that there's no discipline on this and that their answer has no bearing on the raise we just discussed. I want real candid thoughts.\n\nThe point is, I can't trust people to come forward with some of that themselves, for fear they'll rock the boat too much. This gives them a chance to express their thoughts in the grey areas, where it's more opinion or custom than actual rule breaking or illegality. \n\nBecause I want to find out things like what you just described before it becomes a problem.",

          "body": "What I can say is I have an HVAC company I use. I am another local business owner. It ALL started from me calling them randomly when my office air went out at 1PM on a hot July day. I called after seeing their reviews and the dispatch said they wouldn't be able to get out to me for another 24 hours. Anyway I go to leave around 6pm I hear some banging on the wall and two of their guys are out there. I said \"I thought you weren't coming until tomorrow!\" Their answer \"Well we were on our way home and was passing your office anyway we figured we might as well take a look\" I was locked in from that day. They were my HVAC guys from here on.\n\nMany years down the road I buy a house and the AC went down and they came out and said I needed a 3 ton (3100 sq ft) furnace and AC unit (I knew it was time). I asked them on three different discussions \"Are you SURE I don't need a 5 ton?\" I was told no over and over. Well, the day came and two service techs showed up went to work and I asked them \"You guys sure I don't need a 5 ton?\" at this point they're installing the furnace. Suddenly they come down and call me over. \"Well.....you need a 5 ton\" I laughed and said \"See!\" they said \"Well we gotta go get the 5 ton units and take the furnace back out so we will be here longer.\" I asked what kinda pizza they liked.\n\nSo they go to leave and I say \"So whats it going to cost me now?\" he looked at me and said \"Nothing! This is on us\". I will never use another HVAC company and use them for my commercial property. They always come out quick and are honest. So yes once you do right by a solid customer they will  call you every time. To date I have probably paid out $13k to them over the years and there is NO ONE else I will call going forward.\n\nI will NEVER leave them and I will tell you something else watching them has enforced my standards at my own business. We can always do better and learn. I know how they made me feel so I want to do that for my clients as well. You're doing it the right way, don't ever stop doing it the right way because  there's not many of us out there doing it the right way.",

We've been in business for 18 years and I have processed a good many state-mandated wage garnishments for child support so I am well acquainted with the process.\n\n  \nThis week I was served papers by a process server for a Continuing Writ of Garnishment against one of my employees.  This is not child support related but rather a debt owed to a bank for about $3,500.00.  The papers were served by a law firm and have been filed with our local court.  These read very differently from the regular child-support garnishments I am used to.  This garnishment letter states that my failure to execute all documents and as well as begin garnishing wages in a timely manner could result in the full debt obligation being charged to us (our company).  \n\nI am directed to fill out the paperwork enclosed, expedite return to the law firm and file a copy with our local clerk of court within 20 days of receipt.\n\nAnd the fee I can charge for all the work - $17.  State of Florida allows a $5 admin fee for the first payroll garnishment and $2 each payroll after.  I have to pay for the expedited return shipping of docs to the law firm.  I have to pay for the filing fee with the clerk of court.  And $17 does not begin to cover the amount of administrative time that will be applied to this endeavor.\n\nIt absolutely BOGGLES my mind that I am expected to bear the costs for this person's inability to pay their bills or handle their personal finances.  Not only that but if I fail to respond/take action quickly, I could be responsible for HIS debt!!!  \n\nI am upset and outraged.  I have enough expenses and worries being a small business owner.  Now I have to also handle/solve the debt issues of those I hire??  Insane.",

It's a small agency that services a rural area. Most of our clients are a county away, at the furthest. Several years ago we get a very official looking cease &amp; desist from a similarly named company on the other side of the country. They demand a settlement payment because we're infringing on their name/trademark/whatever, citing several laws, and that we change our business's name immediately or they will sue us in federal court of blah, blah, blah . . .\n\nWell, one partner was fretting about how we were going to come up with the cash to pay them off and change everything about the business. We send the letter to our legal counsel and ask what we have to do, what our obligations are, etc. The lawyer sends back his draft of a response letter with the legalese version of telling them to politely fuck off. Our lawyer advises us that we don't do business in the same states so they have no standing. We never heard from them again, but we do occasionally get calls from that area from people that found us online. I guess that's more a testament to how good our webhost is with their site design &amp; SEO, though.",

You being the small business, and your employee - being just a small little individual. It sucks but it is what it is.\n\nI used to work for a bank. I worked there through the housing market collapse of 2008. I saw first hand how predatory banks would get. Charging people $35 overdraft fees per transaction regardless of the amount of the transaction. There was a cap of five overdraft fees a day before the collapse. They raised it to ten overdraft fees max per day during the crisis. So I had to justify these fees to customers by saying ‘well we paid for the item’ or ‘you didn’t manage your account and so it cost us money to receive and reverse this charge so here’s a fee for each’. All while many people just had less than a hundred dollars of charges that brought them negative - then getting $350 of fees per day, plus fees for the account staying negative. \nAll it takes is a mortgage payment, a hospital bill that was paid, to get so negative, then a mountain of fees for the ‘burden’ of having this negative account on the books and you’re done.

The silly part is the employees don't have to be married, so I'll let you fill in the blanks on that one. Sure they pay into the insurance scam... of pennies on the dollar.\n\nWhy not compensate employers just as well? Don't want to shell out double the price for the $100 dollars they paid over one year?

Many small business owners find this crazy the first time it happens, especially since the language of those commandments sounds intentionally threatening.\n\nThat said (and without diminishing the unfairness of the situation), in Florida these types of garnishments are not optional, and the employer only faces risk if you don't respond or comply with their requests. In practice, if you fill out the form correctly, submit it on time, and follow the process, you don't end up being responsible for the debt. The system is designed to force you to cooperate, not to transfer the obligation to you… even if the wording is awful.\n\nI completely agree that the administrative fee is absurd and doesn't reflect the actual time or costs (especially postage and filing). Unfortunately, the state views it as a \"civic duty\" of the employer, not as a service you provide voluntarily.\n\n\nIf you don't already, it's usually worthwhile to have a standard internal procedure (checklist + templates) for these situations. This reduces the administrative burden and stress when they arise. It shouldn't be necessary, but it helps protect you.\n\n\nIn short: your frustration is valid; the system is clumsy with small businesses. However, as long as you strictly adhere to deadlines and complete all the paperwork, the actual risk to your company is low.",

She had a stall at her school’s end-of-term event and asked me to help her with sales. My son came along to help and, for the first time, saw a small amount of money turn into a pile of cash as we sold out in two hours. He was fascinated by how money is made.\n\nWhat happened next:\nA week later, he asked me for a drone. I told him I wouldn't buy it for him. After he realized I wasn’t going to budge, he asked if he could start a business to earn the money himself, inspired by the day at the cupcake stall.\nHe convinced my sister to teach him how to make chocolates. He invested ₹300 of his own pocket money into molds and chocolate compound. He and his cousin made 100 chocolates and, before we even woke up the next morning, they had sold them all for ₹5 each, making ₹500. They have since bought more supplies and sold even more.\n\nThe advice I need:\nWhile I am very happy and proud of what he has achieved, I’m honestly not sure how to handle this.\n-Should I fully support this and let him continue?\n-Should I be setting specific rules for him?\n-How do I manage a child of this age starting a \"business\" venture?\n-Any other advice you might have for me?\nI’m looking for perspectives on the best way to guide him through this.",

You don’t need to shut it down, but you also don’t want it to turn into pressure or a grind.\n\nI’d support it, but with guardrails. Keep it clearly framed as a learning project, not a responsibility or expectation. Let him run it when he wants, pause when he’s bored, and stop entirely if it stops being fun.\n\nSetting simple rules helps. Things like fixed hours, adult supervision for money and food safety, and a clear split between saving, spending, and reinvesting. This keeps it educational instead of chaotic.\n\nUse it as a teaching tool. Talk through basic ideas like costs, profit, and why he doesn’t get to keep every rupee as “free money.” You can even introduce a rule where part of the profit goes toward the drone, part goes into savings, and part is for fun or sharing.\n\nMost importantly, protect his childhood. Don’t scale it, don’t optimize it, don’t turn him into a mini entrepreneur. The real win here isn’t the drone, it’s that he learned he can create something, take initiative, and follow through.

These could be used in the school bookstore to purchase snacks or small toys.  My son and his friends got one and made counterfeit Eagle Bucks.  They would buy snacks and toys with Eagle Bucks and sell them for cash at highly inflated prices.  One day he got a pencil topper toy.  He friend wanted to see it and my son said $1 for 30 seconds, after 30 seconds he took the toy back.  The next day his friend wanted to buy it, so he sold it for $5.  He made $6 on a $0.25 toy that he got for free.  We encouraged him not to do unethical things like counterfeit currency, but he use those skills to build his own small business.",

Nothing bad will come of it, but he can pick himself up and jump on the next fascination if all goes downhill (hoping for his explosive success, but life does happen). If he comes to you with a problem offer to help, make sure he knows he has you as a parachute, and by all means give insights and support, but truly encourage him to make his own decisions and make or break things. It'll be a hard at times, and he'll inevitably want to do things differently than you would, but the mindset he's building now will carry him so so far. I honestly believe that being comfortable with the idea of \"I might fail and that's okay\" is the biggest lesson that's learned too late by most, and he's in such a privileged spot to learn it early. I promise you this won't be his last attempt at this either, just keep fostering that idea that it's possible to enjoy the bads just as much as the goods\n\nHonestly, I'd see this more of a character and bond building exercise for both of you than anything.

Okay on to my story. \n\nMy oldest son and his next oldest brother (we have 8 kiddos) are 10 and 8 years of age. I am in the trades and have been for a while but over time moved up to more of a managerial position and learned the business side and loved it. My passion for this spawned a small side business that is essentially a handyman style ordeal and I have 2 guys that work as needed for me and I keep them fairly busy, they are paid by job not hourly and older gentleman. One day we had a customer ask if we could fix up her dog house, it was trashed and falling apart so we rebuilt it. My oldest son and I knocked it out pretty quick for building portion then he and my younger son painted it and all the small details. Naturally I paid them for their work and my God did it light a fire.\n\nTyler(oldest) Mav(younger) came to me about a week later and asked to borrow some paper and pencils to draw up some stuff. Low and behold this little entrepreneur has come up with a full blown business building dog houses and play houses and made a whole layout of plans for about 6 different setups ( they were highly crude and made no sense on layout but hey it was a start!) They showed it to me with biggest smile and said they wanted to do a business building these for folks and called it 'Sweet T and Lil Mav's Construction'  it was a cool little run, didnt last long unfortunately they petered out quick, but it was ridiculously fun while it lasted. My oldest still occasionally does little stuff like that but the younger one is much more introverted and lost interest fast. \n\nAnyways ultimately I say let that man cook and conquer the market !",

If you use the drone to make even a penny an any way shape or form in the US you have to take another expensive and complicated test. In the US its called a part 107.

I bought her out for £37,000 and we had both initial put in £17000. legally I don’t owe her anything and everything was done properly. i feel like such an idiot but at the end of the day she is still my little sister so my emotions are all over the place with this one. I can afford to pay her but feel like the way she is going about it is just so wrong. If she asked me for money I would happily give it to her but why come at it like this.

Many business owners have friends, family, and/or mentors that motivate them to push forward with their goals and ideas. Lots of people get help along the way in their journeys. But business owners don't compensate every single person who gives them some advice or motivation along the way. That's not sustainable. \n\nYour sister clearly had zero desire to do the work necessary to get the business to where it is now. She wanted out after TWO MONTHS?! That's basically no time or effort. She realized that there would be a lot of work that needed to be done to operate the business and she had no interest in doing any of that work. Now she wants the money earned from the hard work she was unwilling to put in. That is absolutely asinine. \n\nTell her if she wants to earn money from the business you're running, she can work as an employee on the truck and you can pay her.\n\nAnother option if she wants to feel like an owner, since you say you have the ability to scale, you can franchise the business and she can be a franchise owner. She can run her own truck but will have to pay you franchising fees etc in order to use the brand name and the brand's ingredients like any other franchise structure.\n\nUnder no circumstance should you just outright give her money.

Doing this means he can decide when (or if) to pay you, so he doesn't have to factor it in much on his expense schedule. Basically, you're low-priority to him (and yes, you are being disrespected).\n\nIn addition, there is the [time value of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money) - the longer a payment can be delayed, the less it's worth in real-world value. Getting paid in January is worth more to you than having the same amount paid in September, and likewise delaying a payment means the customer is paying you less in value even if they're paying the same amount in raw numbers.\n\nTo mitigate this, you may want to look at including items in your contracts, such as late payment penalties that increase over time (and, at some point, become extreme enough to trigger payment), base rate increases (or loss of access to discounts) for customers who regularly pay late, or simply declining credit (including n30/n90 etc) for customers who have a history of late payments.\n\nIn addition, move everyone over to the new contract at the end of the current one - this guy should not be able to 'grandfather' themselves in just because they're a long-term customer; what they actually are is a long-term *deadbeat*.",

Use a voice prompt on your virtual phones such as \"you have reached AAA, if you know your party's extension, dial it now.

Also in my business, we make the best products in the market and it still applies. You could make the best product possible and 1% of people will complain. You need to accept this fact. Don't let negative feedback pull you down. Too much negative feedback as a % of sales is what you should be concerned about.\n\n3-Just do it, if the risk is low, JUST TRY THE THING. We spent too long trying to make the perfect product, listings, images etc. You learn more by just doing. We also know that as much as 30% of everything we list will fail. So we will remove it from Amazon FBA after time (this applies to any business). \n\n4-The right people are more important than anything else. Do you have the right mix? Do you complement each other?

Half the \"passive income\" gurus on YouTube are making their money teaching you how to make passive income. It's turtles all the way down.​\n\nI'm not saying don't automate or systematize - that's just smart business. But can we stop pretending that any income stream doesn't need feeding? Your Shopify store isn't a Tamagotchi. It needs actual work.​\n\nSo here's my question: when did \"I run a profitable business that doesn't consume my entire life\" become less sexy than \"I make $47 a month while I sleep\"?",

          "body": "You can call it whatever you want. In some ways true passive income is closer to an investment.\n\nYou calling it ;active income; makes no sense to me because no one says this. The world is more complex now and a term such as passive income doesn't really explain things or cover the entire breadth of all possible types of passive income.\n\nA better word is simply 'work'. Business takes work and it's always a gamble. The gamble on some types of businesses take longer to pay off or see a return. But lets say content creation as an example - this can take years to pay off but when you reach a certain point, you can call it passive income (to an extent).\n\nThis ties very heavily into the platforms someone chooses. If you are a streamer then your income is almost 100% tied to performing streams. If you do youtube then your income relies on you staying relevant so that your content is promoted. If you stop, your income wont stop immediately but its still tied to putting out content.\n\nI'm not saying this is a better business model than any other, but it does have unique advantages. You can quit youtube for a whole month (or longer) if you build up enough content to release on a schedule. People do this all the time. During this holiday or time off, the income is passive. But the business itself isn't truly passive.",

And actually if you see how many hours you need to invest regularly, you see that it's a job still.\n\n2) A classic example of renting out assets, such as real estate - you make several grand each month and feel that it's passive income since you rarely do much more than collecting rent, but in reality you have maintenance, depreciation, pay taxes on it, service fees, insurance, etc and have risks like insolvent tenants that would be hard to evict / vandalism, etc., and in the long run you could be far better off selling that house / apartment, putting your money into S&amp;P 500.

      "selftext": "Edit: thanks for all the comments! I'll get back to everyone by tomorrow :)\n\nHey everyone! Just over two months ago, I launched a side project that’s quickly showing potential, and I’d love some advice on how to grow it.\n\n**The concept:**\n\n• I host regular board game nights at public venues.\n\n• Entry fee is $5 cash per person for the entire evening.\n\n• People can come alone or with friends, I place them on a table, they play games (not the niche tabletop ones, more social party games), and meet new folks.\n\n**Current setup:**\n\n• I’ve built a group on a popular social app (300+ members have joined organically, though only a fraction attend these events).\n\n• So far, attendance per event has ranged from as little as 2 ppl, to as high as 23 people (although these are the extremes, I have an average attendance of 7 ppl, and am consistently trending higher in recent events). I also happen to have a pretty good return rate, and there are now 6-8 regulars.\n\n• Upfront costs: \\~$547.22 for several board games, a few bits and bobs (pens, name badges, etc) and the app membership.\n\n• Income: \\~$645.00 in total (210 the first month, and 435 the second); I’m now officially in profit.\n\n• Venue is free (local bars or food courts), so no additional costs on my part there.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n• I want to grow attendance (30 attendees per session would be solid) and attract specific crowds (young people, 20-30, as well as more women to balance it out) and better leverage social media platforms.\n\n**Questions for you (and please share any useful advice):**\n\n• How would you scale something like this without raising prices? The $5 fee matches local board game café pricing and I want to keep it the same.\n\n• As the group grows, I'm aware that hosting duties will become more and more complicated, but I'm still unsure how to proceed - should I pay someone to help me host?\n\n• I’m struggling to reconcile my financial objectives with my willingness to make sure everyone is having a good time; basically, I’m very picky with who I invite. Most of my promo so far has been done through subreddits for the town I live in and Facebook groups – I always do a background check on people first, and have a quick chat with them to gauge the kind of person they are. I do this to avoid having problematic profiles (creeps, scammers, intolerant people, you name it) but this comes at an extra effort, and also highly limits the clients I get (I must lose 50% of potential customers with this system). I know it’s a stupid question even before I ask it, but have some of you found a good way to filter out the bad weeds in a more efficient way, or do you just take the risk to have these sorts of clients anyways?\n\n• I've had some suggestions to use a subscription system, but sounds quite complicated to set up logistically, and I like the idea of people having the flexibility of paying per session. Are there any real upsides to this system?\n\n• Creative ideas to reach more people? I'm struggling to find people in their twenties - it seems most user pools I'm targeting have 30 year olds...where are all the twenty year olds?? Same goes for finding women – very few of them seem to respond to my posts…I’m trying Instagram and TikTok which I hope might attract these crowds, but growth is painfully slow.\n\n• Anything else I should keep in mind moving forward? This is my first entrepreneurial project so I’d really appreciate any insights :)",

          "body": "I hate to be a downer but I'm not sure this makes sense as a business. It may make more sense simply as a fun thing that you enjoy, where the entry fees defray some of your costs. As a business, you've made $100 in profits over two months while ignoring the cost of your own time, which includes hosting the game sessions themselves as well as all the time you spend promoting them and recruiting and screening attendees. If you're doing this on a larger scale then you'll also probably want liability insurance. And a larger scale also probably means it's not always you who's personally running the game nights and doing the screenings, so you'll need to pay somebody. Even if it's just you, you should include your own notional \"salary\" in your figures in order to be realistic and not fool yourself - your time is not free. Try to estimate how much you're ultimately earning per hour of effort, after considering all your costs.\n\nTo make this work, I think you need to find ways to get more income per session. $5/person seems really low. Maybe buy games at wholesale and sell physical copies during sessions at retail prices: people like instant gratification. Sell game-related T-shirts and merch. Charge a small fee to indie game companies for including/promoting their games at your sessions. Create a newsletter or social media account for the group with affiliate links to where people can purchase the games that they played, so you earn a commission. Strike a deal with a bar or restaurant to get some percentage of the tab or a flat fee if your session brings in a minimum number of extra people on a normally slow day. Offer a membership option for something like $15/month as an alternative to paying as you go - many people are lazy and will sign up but then come rarely/never.",

          "body": "Good for you. I'm not sure how long you will be able to continue charging. I attend a weekly game meetup. It's free and there are anywhere from 25 to 40 ppl in attendance. It has been going for 13 years. I would be worried at some point a few of your attendees will swap contact info and say, \"hey, let's just start meeting at X and skip the entrance fee\". I recommend introducing at least one new game a month. Keep a real close eye on BGG's lists to stay current on your game selection. This might keep people coming back. All the game stores in my area have free weekly game nights, and game libraries ranging from 10s to 100s. So you need to determine what sets your paid event apart and better than the alternatives.\n\n20s is the wrong demographic IMO. I've been to boardgame conventions and boardgame meetups. The age demographic is more like 35 to 65. I'm guessing about 75% male to female. Also, college kids are pretty savvy using social media to coordinate and would also quickly recognize they don't need to pay someone to play a game. \n\nIf you are a really good story teller or theater geek, I recommend you look into Blood on the Clocktower and start hosting BotC events. If you get really good, people would definitely pay to attend and most would be regulars. But it doesn't scale well. 10 people at $10 each for 3 hours is not really worth it unless you love it.",

It could be a one off contest to start with a prize at the end, bonus points if the prize is a gift certificate to the venue if they want to offer that. If it goes well, could turn into a repeatable thing like how people often do trivia nights.",

The fact that you screen people is already a step above public events.\n\nIt sounds like you could lean on the 'club' angle even though you are operating in public spaces now. This wouldn't feel very club-like or exclusive. For that you would need to think about paid venues, starting small like finding cafes or restaurants in their off hours and seeing what deals you can do.\n\nHaving a new mystery location could be part of the fun but it would take a lot of effort to continually do this. But it could be done on rotation basis, adding more venues as you find them. \n\nNext is turning the event into more of an event. Making it more enticing, enough for people to get out of the house, maybe bring some of their friends and plan for it instead of taking it for granted.\n\nIf every games day/night is the same old, people are going to think they can always go to another event. This is how I feel about a friend's regular games day.\n\nI don't know what could be done or what is feasible. I mentioned planning food but this is very high effort, but could be done in conjunction with venues you find. \n\nFast forward a bit - you now have a few reasonably sized restaurants or cafes who let you use their space in exchange for buying food. Now you can do a rotation so each event is different and people who miss out can eventually 'try' it. \n\nYou can combine the above with additional themes, dressing up/cosplay, specific games, awards and prizes, etc to make each event even more enticing. \n\nUltimately you want to target people who have money to spend. They can already buy whatever they want, but they can't buy an experience off the shelf. Find and target these people within the gaming demographic if you want to scale.",

      "selftext": "I’m 28 and I’ve been working for about a year and a half as the only assistant for the owner of a small but high revenue entertainment and business management company. It’s just me and her. No HR, no backup, no real systems. On paper it looks like a solid job. I make around 72k a year, I have autonomy, and I’m exposed to finance, payroll, taxes, and high profile clients. In reality, I am completely burnt out and wake up most mornings with a pit in my stomach.\n\nI handle almost everything. Paying company and client bills, payroll, reconciling endless bank and credit card accounts, handling physical mail and deposits, dealing with IRS and state notices, and putting out constant fires that pop up with no warning. Over time the workload has increased a lot. We onboarded new major clients, migrated banks, and are still using outdated systems that do not scale. None of that came with more support or clearer processes. The expectation is always to just figure it out. When something goes wrong, it turns into a personal issue instead of a systems issue.\n\nRecently I tried to have an honest conversation with the owner about getting help, improving processes, and talking about the future. She had previously told me that one day I could take over or buy the business, so I asked what that would even look like. She told me she has no succession plan, no long term plan, and no intention of changing how she runs things. The conversation quickly turned defensive and blame focused. It became very clear that we have completely different ways of thinking and working. I left that meeting realizing I have lost respect for her leadership and I do not see a future here.\n\nFor context, I am not afraid of hard work. I graduated college in 2020 with a bachelor’s degree in business administration. Before this job, I worked in high end real estate sales at a brokerage that even had a Netflix show, but I left because the culture and status games were extremely toxic. Before that, I worked restaurant jobs, grocery stores, manual labor, home inspections, and even admissions at a major health system. I stayed at every job for over a year and I have always shown up and done what was asked of me. I am proud that I have been able to handle this level of responsibility at my age, but I am realizing that responsibility without support is not growth. It is just burnout.\n\nRight now I feel stuck. I know I cannot do this long term. It is affecting my mental and physical health. At the same time, I am scared to quit without another job lined up. This role is so custom built that even a standard two week notice feels unrealistic. My current plan is to stay professional, emotionally detach, do what is required, and quietly start applying elsewhere while I am still employed.\n\nI am looking for outside perspective. Is it reasonable to job search while mentally checked out like this? How do I frame this role to future employers without trashing my current boss? Are these red flags that mean I should leave sooner rather than later? And has anyone else been in a small business role where everything falls on one person, and how did you get out?",

And there's some graphic design and signage lessons you might need to watch.\n\nReal quickly I can list out a few.  Way - way back in the day I used to do mailers. I was the lead graphic designer.\n\n* Don't say shit that you don't do on the job. \"We won't break your windows.\"\n\n* Don't claim things that should be obvious to your trade.  \"We are clean and use sterol equipment at our dentist office.\"\n\n* The main thing you need to get out there is \"who\" you are, \"what\" you can offer, and \"how\" they can get in touch.  Optionally, \"where\" you are located maybe relevant.  So you may want to include that as well. \n\n* Slogans are risky but can be rewarding. Keep it short and make sure it sounds and reads well.  Ask a friend if it's appropriate too.  \n\n* Adding discounts and other incentives should be reserved, strict and limited.  Offering someone 50% off of something calls into question the value of what you're offering.  Instead offer 10 or 15% off for a limited time under a limited condition. \n\n* Don't use fonts and graphics that you can't read.  Do a thumbnail test.  You can shrink down your ad very very small on your screen.  If you can still see what's what, you're good.  \n\n* It's super risky to include photos - cartoons and graphics are okay.  Most of the time a photo feels inappropriate and off-putting with some added liability.  Using pictures of employees is a time bomb, hire actors if needed.  Never include your own face in a photo unless you're a real estate agent. There are exceptions, but do so at your own risk.   A picture of a work vehicle or fleet is one of the exceptions.  People like to see you're a permanent, established business. \n\n\n* Avoid light on white, dark on dark, or any similar color on color text and graphics.  While it may be cool to have your gray logo on a black background.  It's going to look like noise to someone who has half a second to see your ad.  If you do want to do this still, consider adding an outline around your graphic or text.\n\n* Avoid tangents. This is complicated to explain with words.  Essentially, it's when a perceived line touches another perceived line which makes viewers uncomfortable.  For example, the point of a square touching the edge of a page.  Or the edge of the square touching the edge of the page or a border of another graphic. See link. https://share.google/aLoGXHnmUfPyslBeQ\n\n* This one is tough for me. Proofread your work.  Or get an AI to help you with it.  I'm super bad at proofing because I'm dyslexic.  But if you misspell even one word - even when it is intentional, potential customers will look down on you. (This one is really touchy. I've had to call clients, telling them we corrected typos and they would get stupid angry.  If someone points out something odd about your ads, please use your business brain. They are not attacking you, they are bringing up real concerns about making money.)\n\n\nI don't know if this is what you're looking for.  I think you want to know more about the logistics of ad placement and frequency.  But I thought I'd chime in with this little tidbit.",

When you don't know exactly where the friction is, every bad day feels like a personal failure instead of just a data point to be adjusted.\nIn my experience, restructuring for a shop at your level usually boils down to three things:\n\n1.Are you sending all your traffic to the same landing page? If you segment your entry points (Ads/Social) by audience intent, your conversion reliability goes up, and your stress goes down.\n\n2.Often, it’s not the ad failing; it’s a failure in how the user moves from the ad to the sale. If you isolate exactly where they drop off, you don't have to guess what to fix.\n\n3.You mentioned using AI for monitoring, but are your DMs and Email flows automated? Replacing manual handling with structured flows is the fastest way to lower management cost and mental load.\n\nSo in general even though this might sound harsh, the stress doesn't magically go away when you spend over 10k, it only stabilizes when you move from fragmented activity to a coherent revenue system.\n\nThere is a bunch of more variables which could play a part depending on industry among other things but I hope that helped.

You don't need to hyper optimize your ads strategy right now if it's doing *good enough*.\n\nStill, it did take me a solid 6-10 months of learning and making mistakes and optimizing my approach before I felt like I was getting more revenue out of them then I was spending. It got to the point where I've had them disabled for the past few months because now we have too much work.\n\nIt's important to not constantly hyper fixate and tweak - make a decision and let it run for a week or two before deciding to analyze your approach. Ads work best on the long game.\n\nMinor advice: if you're a hands on person who helps run a leads based business like I am, you might find way more success using manual CPC vs trying to optimize for max clicks of whatever AI based garbage google &amp; their salespeople wants to sell you. A lot of the other ad strategies are optimized entirely for major brands or people looking to have global reach with the money to waste on it. You will blow a LOT of money on garbage traffic doing max clicks, pmax, or AI run campaigns. If you are running your own ads, do manual CPC and then ideally once you get enough data from that you can run campaigns that target conversions hooks you've set up. Make sure you have a good landing page. That's 80% of the battle right there.",

The irony is the checking creates the anxiety you’re trying to manage.\nWhat changes at higher spend isn’t that fear disappears, it’s that patterns get clearer and you stop reacting to every blip. People who feel calm at 10k plus aren’t braver, they’ve just accepted longer decision windows and fewer levers. The moment you start judging ads day by day, you’ve already lost the mental game.\nIf it were me, I’d simplify before I outsourced. Fewer campaigns, fewer changes, fixed review days. Agencies don’t remove uncertainty, they just move it out of sight while you pay for the privilege. The relief only sticks if the structure is sound. Otherwise you’re still anxious, just with invoices.\nSo yes, you’re overthinking, but it’s understandable. The fix isn’t another dashboard.

If you can offer something that your competition can't, or won't, do it!  I know people that go to Les Schwab (ewwwwwww!) for their free popcorn!!!  Seriously.  If there's a special service or product line or something that sets you apart, try it!  Maybe a store kitty!  or doggo!  Or you'll load their lumber for them!  Whatever, just think about adding extra 'something'.  Pair with a local restaurant and offer free burritos or.....  I do wish you good luck and I hope you can make it work.  We NEED locally owned businesses!  They are what drives America!",

Right now interest rates are at an all time high. So people who finance home construction/renovation are just not doing it right now. This is prolly 90% of your audience. People who pay cash for home construction/renovation are likely not messing with small local lumber yards.\n\nAlso, the economy in general is super crappy right now. I build websites for small businesses. I'm finding that in general all of my clients across multiple industry segments have 20-50% lower web traffic this year when compared to last year. This directly translates into fewer phone calls and as a result lower income. All of my contractor/construction clients have canceled their websites this year. So I think this is your audience.\n\nWithout knowing exactly where you are, I would suspect a substantial portion of your historic clientele either own a small business or are directly employed by one.\n\nHere's my advice, your family has likely spent decades building relationships with your community. Just because they're not spending money right now doesn't mean they wont when the interest rates come back down. Which let's be honest will happen when Powell is replaced in May. This year's gonna be rough for you, but if you can find a way to cut costs and hold on, eventually there will be a recovery, and if you have decades of history with your community you'll be at the forefront of the local recovery. Your audience know who you are and are counting on you even if they're not buying anything right now.\n\nthis is assuming things don't get worse. There's really no way to tell anymore.",

          "body": "There are diff ways to do valuations. With businesses like this I typically use SDE like this:\n\nOwner’s SDE x (multiplier of 0.8-1.2) + fair market value of assets - liabilities. \n\nThe multiplier is based on the recent growth of the business. Strong growth in profits? 1.1-1.2. Flat growth? 0.95-1.05. Declining profits? 0.8-0.9. \n\nFair market value of assets is tricky but you can just go to Facebook marketplace and look for similar. Generally I use the “priced to move” valuation. \n\nBrand recognition, loyalty, “good will” is harder to put a price on,  it ultimately it boils down to the profit the owners are taking home. So I don’t usually put a big number on that. \n\nThe fact that the owners are taking such a low pay for a big job is a concern. You’ll likely have to adjust the SDE to hire a replacement for one of them.\n\nSo $50k SDE x 1.0 multiplier + assets (rounding up) $40k - 0 liabilities = $90k valuation.",

          "body": "Sounds like the initiative would be a strategic sale, or a sale to some youngblood with hopes and dreams. The separate kitchen doesn't come with the business, but can a contract be put in place? What relevance is the full-time baker if they (presumably) work in the separate kitchen?\n\nIt sounds like the sellers are banking on an attractive location, established reputation, and \"could make\" $X level. You don't pay them for the incremental increase you have to pursue, so that last factor is irrelevant. My thoughts are the key, at least in the short term, is ensuring continuity of product availability and quality, particularly if you don't already have ovens or a third-party baker. Take a long, hard look at that part of the equation. Would your COGS be commensurate as what they were doing when they were, effectively, baking in-house?\n\nBeyond that, I would have to assume the location is a large part of the intangible value given retail bakers don't typically have much else that's readily long-lived and transferrable. And I'd get a sense of the sellers' intentions once they offload this location. If they're so good that they can forget this location and just start another near or at their bakery, and simply market themselves as \"We moved to...\" and undercut your prospective operations, then all you'd really be receiving is their stand at a historic location.",

Anything consistently above that is either very efficient, very niche, or not fully counting costs yet. Plenty of people doing big top-line numbers are sitting in the single digits or even barely break-even.\n\nFor most, margins have gotten worse over the past year. Ads are more expensive, shipping hasn’t fully come back down, returns are higher, and software creep is real. You have to work harder now to protect the same margin you used to get more easily.\n\nThe biggest “aha” moments usually come from indirect costs. Ad inefficiency hidden by scaling, subscriptions that seemed cheap individually but added up, returns and refunds quietly eroding profit, and labor time that wasn’t being costed properly. A lot of people realize too late that growth masked leaks instead of fixing them.\n\nIf you’re still profitable, cash-flow positive, and not burning out, you’re probably doing better than you think. The real lever usually isn’t more revenue, it’s tightening one or two big leaks. Most margin improvements come from fewer moving parts, not bigger swings.",

          "body": "I don’t think it’s just you, this is a very common experience with business brokers, especially on the smaller deals. A lot of them aren’t really acting like salespeople, they’re acting like gatekeepers whose main job is to not screw up the listing they already have.\n\nThe reason everything feels so locked down is usually seller paranoia mixed with weak qualification systems. Sellers are terrified their employees, landlords, or competitors will find out they’re selling, so brokers overcorrect by hiding even basic info. Instead of filtering serious buyers properly, they default to NDAs, questionnaires, and forced calls because that’s the only process they know.\n\nThe irony is that many brokers are also undertrained and overloaded. They blast generic auto replies because they’re juggling too many listings and most inquiries are tire kickers. When you ask for numbers before a call, some take it as a threat to their control of the process rather than a reasonable request. The “threatening to drop you” behavior usually means they’re insecure about either the deal quality or their own value.\n\nBusiness brokerage is very different from real estate because there’s no standardized disclosure culture. In real estate, rent and square footage don’t reveal who the seller is. In a small deli, revenue numbers can basically identify the business if you’re local, so brokers treat them like state secrets even when it hurts deal flow.\n\nIf you want less friction, you usually have better luck going one layer off the big listing sites. Accountants, commercial lenders, local attorneys, and even restaurant suppliers often know who’s quietly looking to sell and will make warm intros without the theatrics. Another option is dealing directly with owners through local networking or old-school outreach, which avoids brokers entirely, though you lose some protection.\n\nThere are good brokers out there, but they tend to work on larger, cleaner deals and don’t advertise heavily. On the lower end of the market, a lot of what you’re experiencing is just an industry that hasn’t evolved and doesn’t feel pressure to improve because sellers, not buyers, are their real clients.",

If nothing is removed after 2 weeks, you can either respond with how you would treat any unhappy customer (kill them with kindness) or ignore them aka get more better reviews. \nNew reviews should \"counter\" the \"facts\" of the bad reviews. \n\nWhen responding, I would suggest you encourage them to reach out to you directly as you would any unhappy customer. Show other potential customers how you service unhappy customers. aka going above and beyond.\n\nWith getting reviews, you can automate with in emails, or have QR codes everywhere.
