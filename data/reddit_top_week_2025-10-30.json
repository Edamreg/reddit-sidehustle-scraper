Take inventory of YOUR unfair edges and lean on them shamelessly. Let‚Äôs say, start a business with platform like Sitefy and gpt.

      "selftext": "A few days, I shared a post titled\\*‚ÄúIt took me 5 years to finally make money online and now I‚Äôm finally full time and thriving.‚Äù\\*\n\nSince then, I‚Äôve had hundreds of people reach out asking¬†how to get started in UGC, so I figured I‚Äôd make a road map post breaking it all down.\n\nLet‚Äôs be clear:¬†it‚Äôs not easy.  \nBut it¬†*is*¬†accessible and that‚Äôs the beauty of it.  \nIt‚Äôs just a matter of putting the pieces together and staying consistent.\n\nThat said,¬†UGC isn‚Äôt for everyone.  \nIf you hate being on camera, don‚Äôt like sending emails, negotiating, or doing admin work then this probably isn‚Äôt for you.\n\nAlso, anyone who says¬†*you have to buy a course*¬†to learn ANYTHING is a liar.  \nYou can 100% learn UGC or anything else in this world on your own using posts like this, YouTube, and trial and error.\n\nThat said,¬†courses and mentorships can shorten your learning curve, you‚Äôll learn faster, make fewer mistakes, and have people to lean on when you hit roadblocks.  \nIt‚Äôs optional, but it¬†does¬†speed things up.\n\n# Quick FAQ\n\n* **What is UGC?**¬†‚ÄúUser Generated Content.‚Äù It‚Äôs content (usually short-form video) made by regular people for brands to use in paid ads or organic social posts.\n   * **Do I need followers?**¬†No. Brands care about the quality and relatability of your videos, not your audience size. If they do care about your audience size then its influencer marketing not UGC\n   * **Do I need to show my face?**¬†Not always. Voiceovers, product demos, and unboxing videos are all fair game but in my opinion if you never plan on showing your face I probably wouldn't recommend UGC\n* **What equipment do I need?**¬†Your phone and a tripod. A lav mic and LED light (each around $20) are great bonuses.\n* **Do I need experience?**¬†No. You‚Äôll learn as you go. Brands care more about energy, clarity, and authenticity.\n* **What age can do it?**¬†All ages and the industry really needs more people**35+**¬†right now.\n* **Do I need to be good-looking?**¬†Nope. The more¬†normal and relatable¬†you are, the better.\n* **Will my friends/family see my videos?**¬†Probably one day. So only create content for products you‚Äôd be comfortable being seen promoting.\n\n# Step-by-Step: How to Get Started\n\n# 1. Understand What UGC Is\n\nSearch¬†**#UGCexample**¬†on X (Twitter) to see real examples.  \nUGC videos are typically ads for Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube where a creator promotes a product in a real, authentic way.\n\n# 2. Build a Simple Portfolio\n\nUse¬†**Canva**¬†(free version).  \nYou don‚Äôt need Canva Pro.  \nCreate a clean, single-page site with your example videos and an¬†*About Me*¬†section.  \nBuy a $20 URL inside Canva so it looks professional.\n\n# 3. Create 4 Example Videos\n\nUse products you already own.  \nFocus on¬†**good lighting**¬†and¬†**clear sound.**  \nPick four different niches to show variety e.g.:\n\n* 1 beauty or skincare\n* 1 pet-related\n* 1 fitness or wellness\n* 1 app or SaaS product\n\nMake each video a¬†*different style:*\n\n* Talking head with b-roll\n* Voiceover + only b-roll\n* Green screen\n* Testimonial/review\n\n# 4. Film an ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù Video\n\nThis goes on your portfolio alongside your written intro and you can also use it on profiles inside UGC specific platform.  \nUse natural light, keep it conversational, and overlay b-roll that represents you.\n\nDon‚Äôt just say ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Roseanne and I create authentic content.‚Äù  \nInstead, make it personal and specific: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Roseanne, a 38-year-old stay-at-home mom from Utah. I love gardening, fitness, and art. After years in the corporate world, I‚Äôm tech-savvy and love testing new apps and tools. My lean on my past experience in XYZ to work with brands, understand their vision and the scope of their needs, and then deliver content that is valuable and meaningful.\n\nBullet points are easier to read and focus on what makes¬†*you*¬†unique: glasses, grey hair, pets, travel, hobbies, etc.\n\n# 5. Start Applying for Gigs\n\nOnce your portfolio and 4 examples are ready, start applying daily.  \nCheck:\n\n* subreddit : ugccreators has a lot of  job listings \n* X (hashtags: #UGCCreatorsNeeded, #UGCOpportunities)\n* UGC platforms:¬†**Billo, JoinBrands, Vidsy, Cohley, Vidovo, Insense, Popfly, Backstage, Upwork**\n\nTreat it like a¬†**numbers game.**  \nIf you apply every day for an hour, you‚Äôll start landing gigs.  \nIf you apply to 2x more, you‚Äôll land 2x more. ( if you apply 1 hour a day and land 1 gig a week, then apply 2 hours a day and youll land 2 gigs a week)  \nOver time, you can add social proof to your portfolio, your examples get better, and reviews snowball into consistent paid work.\n\nI hope this helps and feel free to ask me anything below.  \nI try to respond to every message, even if it takes a bit.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI want to share something practical that actually worked for me. I‚Äôm not a tech person, not a full-time creator, but I found a simple system that started bringing in around $50/day after 3 months ‚Äî and it‚Äôs surprisingly doable if you stick with it.\n\nStep 1: Start small &amp; solve a real problem\n\nInstead of chasing trends, I looked at what I was struggling with ‚Äî too many side-hustle ideas, no clear plan.\n\nSo I built a tiny digital guide + checklist (think: what to do in week 1, 2, 3). That‚Äôs it.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt fancy, but it solved one pain point: ‚ÄúWhere do I start?‚Äù\n\nAnd people paid for that clarity.\n\nStep 2: Make your content look professional (without hiring anyone)\n\nThis was the key: I realized presentation matters. People buy what looks valuable.\n\nBut I didn‚Äôt want to spend hundreds on filming or models.\n\nSo I experimented with a few tools that let you create realistic human visuals. I used them to make lifestyle-style visuals and short explainer clips for my digital product.\n\nIt made my brand look way more trustworthy, even though it was just me behind the screen.\n\nStep 3: Focus on one platform &amp; post consistently\n\nI picked TikTok (because organic reach is still good in 2025).\n\nMy content formula was:\n\n¬∑ 3 videos per week\n\n¬∑ Each one showing a piece of the process (‚Äúhow I made my first sale‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat I learned about pricing‚Äù, etc.)\n\n¬∑ CTA: ‚ÄúFree checklist link in bio‚Äù\n\nNo editing team, no paid ads ‚Äî just showing small progress each week.\n\nStep 4: Monetize through simple upgrades\n\nOnce I got traction, I added two things:\n\n1.A ‚Äúpremium‚Äù version of the guide with templates and extra walkthroughs ($19)\n\n2.A small group for Q&amp;A support ($15/month)\n\nTogether, that brought me to \\~$2K/month in 3 months.\n\nNot crazy numbers, but real and consistent.\n\nStep 5: Things that helped me most\n\n¬∑ Don‚Äôt wait to look perfect. Post even if your setup is basic.\n\n¬∑ Pick one product and one platform, don‚Äôt scatter your attention.\n\n¬∑ Recycle content: one visual ‚Üí three clips ‚Üí carousel post ‚Üí blog.\n\n¬∑ Use AI tools to save time, not replace creativity.\n\n¬∑ Talk to your early buyers. They‚Äôll tell you what version 2 should be.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe online income space is loud right now, but there‚Äôs still room for small, thoughtful creators who actually help people.\n\nYou don‚Äôt need to build an agency or code a SaaS. Sometimes it‚Äôs just:\n\nidentify a pain point, make something useful, present it well, stay consistent.\n\nHope this breakdown helps anyone thinking about starting something small.",

      "selftext": "I‚Äôm just an average person who keeps burying myself in my life. Two hours ago, I suddenly realized I had been in Gap for two years, but my deposit hasn‚Äôt decrease much. This matter is quite interesting and beyond my understanding, so I'll do a self-reflection and record it.\n\nFeel free to discuss and share knowledge about making money.\n\nBefore deciding to take the Gap, I had some ‚Äúf\\*\\*\\* you money‚Äù money, enough to support around five years of personal life. I thought the Gap was necessary because at the time, the industry I was in wasn‚Äôt going to be my career for life, so I spent my youth searching for a second income source.\n\nDuring the entire Gap period, my requirements for myself were:\n\n1. Try different industries, drop old thoughts, and let new ideas develop.\n2. Don't be so focused on money-making projects, but more on choosing projects based on interest.\n\nThis is my understanding of the Gap: not fight for traditional success or development, but to give myself a period to look at the world and understand the world.\n\nThe following are the side jobs I did during my 2-year gap:\n\n1. Barista: I usually look for coffee shops I like in my city, and if there‚Äôs an open spot, I‚Äôll take a part-time job there. I prefer cafes with unique interiors and interesting customers, it makes work feel less tiring. But to be honest, this job can be physically demanding, and the pay isn‚Äôt great.\n2. Account Executive in Advertising: The reason I got into this is that my previous job was related to the ad industry, so I already had some clients who started reaching out to me for freelance projects. It feels a lot freer than working for a company, but it also requires more self-discipline and planning. I mainly handle client communication, content planning, and project follow-ups. It‚Äôs not physically exhausting, but it‚Äôs still pretty draining, classic agency life haha.\n3. Stocks &amp; Funds: My investment strategy is pretty simple. I use half of my capital for short-term trades in stocks I‚Äôm familiar with, usually making about 1‚Äì8% every two months. The other half goes into areas I‚Äôm less familiar with, but I try to analyze candlestick charts and follow the news daily to predict trends. Since I‚Äôm still learning, the results are pretty average, probably below what a rational investor would typically earn.\n4. Youtuber: I generate story outlines using ChatGPT and make videos with MagicLight. The workflow is pretty simple, which allows for regular updates, and it‚Äôs a high cost-performance side job. There were times I was anxious about data, but then I realized I couldn‚Äôt control the flow. Learning some tricks and posting on different platforms helped me create more engaging content. The results were decent, and I‚Äôm also exploring new ways to monetize this account.\n5. DJ: I have some friends who make music, and we often hang out at clubs together. I‚Äôve always been interested in making music too, but I never had time to learn when I was working full-time. So during my gap period, I studied some DJ basics and started working part-time at a small club I really like. I love the job, though I often worry I‚Äôm not good enough yet ‚Äî but surprisingly, it actually pays pretty well.",

But after a few months, I realized how much I actually\nenjoyed it. Watching someone go from struggling with their first G chord to playing full songs\nis one of the most satisfying things I have ever experienced.\n\nThe schedule is flexible, the pay is steady, and it never feels like work. I usually teach around six\nto eight hours a week, and that easily covers a few bills. More than that, it gives me a creative\noutlet outside my day job.

No, they are not more than a couple of bucks here and there.\n\nHowever, I'm with the mindset that 1$ I get passively is one dollar I don't need to work for, which is a win in my book. For example, cashback programs are a must. I use Trading212 because it's the best one easily avaliable to me (hmu if you want an link) but there are others out there. I use \"invest cashback\" option which would in theory generate more passive income over time, too. High yield savings for any money you will need soon but you don't need at the moment. I also have a post on my profile for Microsoft Rewords. Another one is renting formal clothing, I rent a dress through a local service.

      "selftext": "What 40 Days of Writing Taught Me\n\nwell.... we are starting off on the wrong foot. It is actually only 39 days but I didn't wanna wait another day to write this out as it's fresh in my mind. SO here we are on day 39 of writing everyday. 40 just sounds better in the header. It made you click didn't it? \n\nI‚Äôve written every single night for 39 days straight.\n\nAfter work. After my kids went to sleep.\n\nJust me, my laptop, and my thoughts.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned; the stuff that actually matters üëá\n\n  \n1. Don't wait to start. Start today and figure out what you wanna write about after writing a few. I still don't know what i wanna write everyday I am just writing. \n\n2. 66 days builds a habit - I see why this is true.. I'm almost at day 66 and I don't plan on stopping\n\n3. I write at night so it has been added to my routine. Which is nice because i never know what i'm writing about each night. \n\n4. No need to moitvate myself. Now i ust pay a game with streaks. Consisetency is now my motivations. \n\n5. I have had 5 or more days with no new subscibers. But i kept going and never stopped. \n\n6. I only focused on writing. Now the rule is simple. I can write anywhere else so tonight i'm doing this reddit post. But I have to write. No building a saas, new product etc. No more shiney obects just focus. \n\n7. Fail fast. I wrote about 7.... different topics the first 10 days. I learned quickly that i shouldn't focus on one thing. I stopped wasting time updating my landing page. Now i keep it very generic. \n\n8.  One idea = 10 posts (I wrote about it in an issue. bascially i'm taking 1 newsletter issue and publishing it on X, Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, Youtube, Medium, and a few others. \n\n9. Don't sell. The issue I wrote that said I wrote a book(even though it was a free one) didn't get open nearly as much as my average. Only 15% opened that email because they most likely thought i was selling them something. \n\n10.  Automate the boring parts, not the marketing parts.\n\n11. You won't  figure out what you wanna do unless you do a bunch of things. \n\n12.  Test your audience with content just like a comedian does. Track who visits your site and see what social channel brings in the most refferals then triple down on that one \n\n13. If you wanna write about the latest trending topic. Make sure to have it flow into your day to day writing not just talk about it only. Tell a story behind it. \n\n14.  My kids don't care about followers, they just wanna hang with daddy. Make time for those you care about.  Great businesses don't make you work 24/7. They let you sleep and enjoy life. \n\n15. Help others instead of being helped. It's alot more reasonable for people to see you are making an effort then asking for it. Message that famous person, give them suggestions without pluging your stuff. \n\n  \nHope this helps. Yea there is formatting errors and spelling errors but I'm not going back to proof read it. ",

My number one, best sweet treat I make is my chocolate chip cookies, and in general the other cookie recipes I have are really good too! I only have ever made them for fun, parties, and most recently, a 150 person sweet 16 where they were a hit!! \n\nI thought it would be a great start to maybe advertise my cookies as the holidays are coming up, but I don‚Äôt know where to start? The goal here is not to really start a business, but just make some extra money in general. I think id like to just start by selling locally? Maybe advertise selling them by the dozen or as holiday platters for people who don‚Äôt have the time to do it themselves?\n\nIf I am able to get into a bake sale, should I be printing business cards ahead of time or just see how it goes?\n\nI‚Äôm open to any and all recommendations or ideas!",

And yes, 100% get some simple business cards for the bake sale! Even just your name and an email is perfect for people who want to order more later. As you get going, managing orders through DMs can get a little messy. I actually built a site called [LocallyCaked.com](http://LocallyCaked.com), which is a marketplace for home bakers to list their treats and connect with nearby customers.

These codes became a necessity as they had modules that teachers used for homework and a digital copy of the book.

          "body": "Agreed. My favorite is the predictable upsells. Buy my ebook for 7 dollars, then here's 5 more upsells, inevitably being a 100-300 full course, and then coaching for 5000 or more. \n\nIt is called digital marketing for a reason. That's what they are making money off of, even if they are or are not doing the thing they are selling. \n\nBut its also a double edged sword. Ecom is a common topic in this space. Nobody can deny that people buy things online. And yes, it is possible to start doing it. But a 7 dollar ebook, 300 dollar course, etc is not going to flip a switch and turn on the money machine. It is a business, and far from \"passive\". And the real dirty secret is that any business will require a good chunk of capital to start. \n\nHere's a few pointers ive found helps:\n\n1. If youre seeing an ad for a course on socials, that space is already flooded and will be tough to compete in unless you have a really good plan on how to differentiate. \n2. If you dont have at least a few thousand dollars base to get everything setup and marketing up and running, prob not gonna happen, and it will be another wasted attempt.\n3. Any course you are seeing an ad for that is multiple hundreds of dollars, that information can usually be found for free, or much cheaper on sites like Udemy. Any time im tempted to purchase a course like that, I go and check udemy, and can usually find something similar or better for 50 dollars or less. \n4. Your time is precious, and the most valuable resource you have. Don't under value it. Most of these things listed as \"passive\" income simply aren't. They will require alot of your time, and they will require money to get up and running. And as with any business, its never guaranteed. Using ecom as the example, you could spend dozens or hundreds of hours, and thousands of dollars to launch a store/product/brand etc, all to see it not take off. Then that time and money is gone. \n\nFinally, the only real \"passive\" income is investing. Park your money in assets, and watch it grow. I have spent thousands on courses, alot of which has to do with the fact that I like learning, and dont mind spending 50 bucks to see what dream someone is selling. But looking back, if I would have just parked all that money over the years into something as lame as boring old index funds, id have some serious returns by now.",

Do you have any hobby interests that translate, maybe think outside the box?\n\nThese are all skills I developed at seperate points in my life, but really dedicated the initial time to learn, leaving me huge variety now, flexibility, and fun!  $$ amounts are Canadian\n\n- I teach guitar/piano ($80/hour, currently 30 hours a week from home, because I am really enjoying it, but sometimes I slim it to 15-20 hours if my other interests are higher. $60,000-$100,000/yr\n\n- I teach people how to fly model planes and racing drones($50/hour ish), and teach groups of kids how to build and launch rockets. Very casual, i do this in the dry months, probably just a couple times a week. Most parents are lazy, and won‚Äôt help their kids/youth with these specific hobbies, or think they are going to be expensive (they are not ).  So plenty of room for private instruction. \n\n- Book Keeping for small businesses. Not much skill required. It is not mathy and accounting. It is book keeping.  Don‚Äôt need any license or schooling. Just take some free courses online and find a mentor. Flat rate per month.  Probably $60k/year for 10 hours a week of whenever-I-want work at the coffee shop. \n\n- I enjoy working with wood. I have a full garage of wood working tools and machines, all paid for exclusively by making wooden towel ladders, and wood wall hexagons to sell to moms/wives on Facebook.   Towel ladders cost about $10 to make, and about 40 minutes to make 4 or 5 of them. I sell for $40-60 depending on details\n\n- I love flipping and trying music gear on marketplace. I rarely buy anything and then sell it for less.  I recycle the money into more gear. Guitars, PA Systems, FX pedals, etc.\n\n- I make video courses and sell on Udemy.  I have a course on how to solve the basic Rubik‚Äôs cube for a complete beginner.  It took me 4 hours to completely create and upload the course including design and film and edit.    It has made $500 total so far in about 6 months. But that‚Äôs a good hourly rate for the work.  I have other similar courses that do better, but that‚Äôs a good example of just thinking outside the box. \n\nOverall, private instruction is just a great living if you are confident in your skill. There are millions of people who only learn well with face to face human contact, and not online videos.    Teach/Instruct anything. \n\nI do have a degree in music, but it‚Äôs in a box in the basement since I got it and no one has ever asked to see it.  I‚Äôve made more money from hobby endeavours, than when I taught in school/college level. \n\nIt‚Äôs the literal ‚Äòfollow your dreams‚Äô approach. \n\nGood luck, message me anytime.",

          "body": "First of all, it's not too late. At age 40, I felt completely stuck in my career as a bank manager. And while I was grateful to have a good-paying job, the work environment was terrible. I had a borderline abusive boss, high-stress, high pressure, and I felt like I had no option but to stick with it until retirement (at least age 60). I couldn't afford to quit. I had a family to look after (married, 3 kids) and we were a single income family. \n\nThankfully, that wasn't the end of my story. \n\nAt age 42, I hit my breaking point, and decided that I was going to do whatever it takes to create another path. Not just go to a different company, but build a business that aligned with the lifestyle my wife and I dreamed of. For us, that was self-employment - a fully remote business that would give us full control over our time and allow us to work from anywhere. \n\nWith no entrepreneurial background and very few skills in online business, etc. I taught myself how to build a basic website, and I started a personal finance blog. I must have watched a couple hundred hours of YouTUbe tutorials to figure it out. That led to a freelancing side hustle, which became a full-time business and replaced my $120k/year bank manager job. \n\nI walked away from the 9-5 in 2022. \n\nToday, I own 2 profitable businesses, both from my laptop. My wife is at home with me and helps me with parts of both businesses. \n\nTwo of our kids are out of the house now, our youngest (19) is still at home. But we have so much time for our kids, our schedules are such that we can help them with various things when needed. For example, we dog-sat for our son and his wife this week while they were out of town. I just worked from their place. Next month, we're flying to Vancouver to see our daughter off as she leaves for Hawaii for six months. \n\nThen, we'll be heading south later in the winter to escape the cold in Canada. \n\nIf you had asked me if any of this was possible in my early 40s, I would have said you are crazy. But I just started on that path, took control over my future, and it completely changed the trajectory of my life. \n\nIf you have more specific questions, let me know. I'd be happy to share any wisdom I have.",

But it is possible to make it work.  \n  \nI've done many different businesses since I was 15-16, some did quite well, some failed completely, but I think all of those failures made me learn new skills that compounded. But even if I was able to make some of those businesses work and had enough saves up, after covid I still got depressed and pretty much wasted 5 years of my life not doing anything, until life forced me to start doing something. I lost all my savings and had to live in my car for a few weeks.   \nThat was 14 months ago and now I have a pretty successful KDP business and 4 full time employees, so it can always get better, keep that in mind.",

I must say, I feel you. \nI screwed up high school for various reasons, then started in life with no degrees (in France, that is terrible as this is the main criteria that determines your value on the work scenery, but I had some hope at the time that I will find my way).\nDid several jobs, mostly mechanical maintenance in the steel industry and nuclear power plants, but that was definitely not my cup of tea (I studied biology...). It paid decently though, especially nuclear shit.\nI also lived abroad and travelled a lot, which made me a different thinking person compared to the average people in my place, quite out of the box and definitely not a good rat for the race.\n\nI eventually started doing ecomm, later opened an ecomm company with my wife that did pretty well for several years but things turned bad and we went out of business, with all the problems you can imagine, debts, wrecked psychological and mental health.\nHad to start a job from way below zero at 38, with 2 kids, a low paying one because, you know, it's all about degrees.\nI just turned 40 a few months ago, and comparing my life, my situation with other people my age or even younger is really depressing, since I lost almost everything and still have debts.\nAnd I am on the way to find THE path, my situation may sound desperate to me at nighttime, when I can't sleep, but this life gave me a strong resilience capacity and the power to keep hope.\n\nI know it will be damn hard, will have to start again from scratch, but trust me, this is not as rough as you may think, if you find some pleasure in it or have an attainable financial goal, the path will be enjoyable. The most important, now that I lost all that shit, is to not lose yourself. If you know who you are, what you are capable of and what you love, you can do great things. And it is the most valuable thing I lost, myself...\n\nSo, as it was said earlier, travel, do new things, get out of your comfort zone, try to find yourself before trying to find your path, this will lead you to things you may not be aware of !\nBut never forget you are not alone stuck in this scheme, and no matter where others are at, write your own story buddy, and that requires you to deeply know yourself. \nWish you the best, as I do to everyone who is lost in their own life ‚úåüèº",

          "body": "It's super simple.\n\nYou have to have something of value to trade for the money. Money is a placeholder for, and a way to measure, the relative value of something.\n\nYour goal for employment is to find the highest and best use of your time. For example...you might be qualified for the following jobs:\n\n$10/hour Fast Food Cashier\n\n$15/hour CostCo employee\n\n$25/hour Bank of America Teller\n\n$50/hour Plumber/Electrician\n\nIn each of those scenarios, you're giving up an hour of your time, but the value that you get is very different across those roles.\n\nIf you're only qualified for the first 2 jobs, then your goal is to figure out what training/education you need to upgrade your options.\n\nA bigger problem right now is that for quite a while now there4 have been more people graduating college than are needed for jobs that require a college degree. Since there are so many more people with college degrees out there than there are jobs that need college degrees, it means that people without college degrees are competing against people with college degrees for jobs that don't require college degrees. And since those people with college degrees largely have student loans and HAVE to work or else they will default on those loans, employers can get away with hiring college grads for cheap in jobs where someone doesn't really need a degree...and that relegates people who just have HS degrees and no other training to basic service jobs. And if you don't have a HS diploma/GED, fahgeddaboudit.\n\nSo if you find yourself struggling to make money, you need to do a real inventory of your skills, spend some time researching what various jobs pay (including any benefits, which have real value by the way) and see where there's overlap\n\nIncome generally doesn't just happen...you are far more likely to get the income you want if you make a plan for how to get there and then take steps down that path. It may take a while, but it'll probably happen because most other people don't make that plan.\n\nGood luck to you!\n\nedit:\n\nFor me, I grew up poor, but did very well in school. Prior to meeting my wife, I almost always have 2-4 roommates and was able to live cheaply and/or save because splitting bills 3+ ways generally is a good strategy for keeping living expenses low.\n\nI eventually got a master's degree from a well-regarded school, and started a business. I struggled to make money in that business for a decade. After 10 years, I decided to change directions and switch industries. During that time, I'd met and gotten to know a lot of people. One of them had several businesses and recognized that I was talented and referred me to a company that he knew was hiring. I started at a salary that was less than I was worth ($72k), and earned meaningful raises. I distinguished myself (provided a lot more value than he was paying for) while there and learned a new industry. I worked there for 10 years until I was making about $275k per year. At that point, I was still underpaid and for that and other reasons I quit. I now work for myself making comparable money in the same industry, and have a flexible schedule that allows me to spend more time with my family.",

Started a niche blog in pet supplies (specialized gear for a particular pet type). Figured it'd be easy - write reviews, slap affiliate links, profit, right? Yeah... no.\n\nMonths 1-4: The delulu phase  \nWriting 2-3 articles per week. Checking Google Analytics every 5 minutes.  \nTraffic? Maybe 10 visitors/day, half were probably me refreshing üíÄ  \nRevenue? $23 over 4 months. I made more finding a $20 bill on the street lmao.  \nMonths 5-8: The reality check\n\nStarted actually learning SEO instead of hoping Google would magically find me. Turns out you can't just write and expect to rank. Who knew? (Everyone except me apparently)\n\nMonths 9-11: The pivot\n\nStopped trying to be an SEO expert and outsourced the heavy lifting. Used Fatjoe for link building 'cause spending 15+ hours/week on outreach to get ghosted by 97/100 people wasn't it.\n\nCurrent stats (Month 14): Traffic: \\~400 visitors/day. Revenue: $800-900/month. Time investment: 5-6 hours/week. Total articles: 67.\n\nWhat moved the needle:\n\n1. Long-tail keywords (not \"best dog food\" but \"best grain-free food for senior dogs with allergies\")\n2. Actual link building from relevant sites\n3. Product roundups convert way better\n4. Patience (nothing happened for almost a year)\n\nThe weird part? Articles from 8 months ago are making money now. You do the work today, maybe it pays off in 6-9 months. Or doesn't lol.\n\nMy advice: Don't expect fast results. Add 6 months to whatever timeline you're thinking. Learn basics, delegate the rest. Long-tail keywords are your friend. Track everything.\n\nAnyone else grinding on niche sites? I feel like everyone either gives up in month 3 or becomes a millionaire and I'm just out here in the middle lmao",

If more than one blows up, the payouts stack like crazy.\n\nI've been doing it myself and already pulled in some solid extra cash. If you want details, drop a comment and I'll share.\n",

I‚Äôm not just looking for quick cash or random gigs‚ÄîI want something that actually teaches me new skills and could potentially turn into a reliable source of income. There are so many options out there, from freelancing and social media management to digital marketing, e-commerce, and content creation, and I want to take the time to figure out which one fits me best. I like the idea of being able to work from anywhere and build something of my own while gaining experience that could open up new opportunities down the road. It feels a bit overwhelming trying to decide where to start, but I‚Äôm excited about the process of learning, experimenting, and finding something that not only pays but also keeps me motivated and growing.",

Traffic and trust come from posting valuable content regularly, whatever valuable means to your customer, financial or emotional. Storytelling helps you explain the benefits to the customer, meaning what benefit they might receive, based on past stories and testimonials. Typically what they receive is a personal transformation, a new self. Sales is a matter of testing, using authoritative framing and tone, and relating to the customer, to find out why they as an individual need this. Trust is important in sales, but that's already built up with content in the traffic funnel. Once they trust you and they're interested in the product, it's then a matter of getting them to convince themselves they need it, without being desperate or pushy.",

This strategy doesnt really teach you any useful skills in life or skills that you can add onto your resume. You also can not grind hours on it to get better, the money is there over time but you do not need to put effort in that time. It is called reverse split arbitrage. Basically when a stock reverse splits, sometimes they round up and in that round up you make profit. For example if a stock had a 1:10 reverse split, every 1 share you owned will turn into 0.1 shares (at 0.1 shares your original value did not change since the stock price is multiplied by this ratio, in this case 10) or if they round you up, you get 1 whole share back. If you want, im open to DMs if your interested in learning the risks/rewards to this method and how to actually maximize it.",

And everytime I try to increase my credit limit they either reject me or give me $500.\n\nThe bucket system is horrible. Basically, it means that if you apply for a Capital One card with a 680 credit score, you're stuck there permanently. It doesn't matter if your credit score is now 820 like mine is (basically perfect, 1% utilization with $90k max credit.) Your score when you apply is your permanent score.\n\nI know this is somewhat unrelated, but fuck Capital One (ironically I use their Chrome extension for coupons anyway lol I was too lazy to switch to Honey.)",

      "selftext": "Hi r/passive_income,\n\nI've been a long-time lurker and wanted to finally contribute by sharing my journey of building a niche blog from $0 to \\~$500/mo in passive income over the last 12 months. My goal is to be 100% transparent about the work, the costs, and the mistakes.\n\n**The Niche:** I chose niche \"vintage camera repair\"\\] because I had a personal interest in it, but I also saw low-competition keywords.\n\n**The Strategy (The \"Passive\" Part):** The income is \"passive\" now, but it took a year of very active, upfront work.\n\n1. **Content:** Wrote 50 high-quality, SEO-optimized articles (avg. 1,500 words).\n2. **Monetization:** Started with display ads (Ezoic/Mediavine) once I hit traffic thresholds.\n3. **Affiliate Links:** Added affiliate links for \\[Products related to the niche, e.g., \"camera parts, specific tools\"\\].\n\n**The Numbers (Approx.):**\n\n* **Month 1-6:** $0 - $20/mo (The \"Google Sandbox\" is real)\n* **Month 7-9:** $100/mo (Traffic started picking up)\n* **Month 10-12:** $300 - $500/mo (Hit ad threshold, articles ranking)\n\n**Total Upfront Cost:**\n\n* Domain: $10\n* Hosting: $120 (for the year)\n* SEO Tool (optional): $99/mo (I used it for 3 months)\n* **Total:** \\~$430\n\n**My Biggest Mistake:** Wasting the first 3 months writing about topics *I* thought were interesting instead of what people were *actually* searching for. Keyword research is everything.\n\n**What's Next:** I now spend about 2-3 hours a month just updating plugins and maybe adding one new article. It's not \"set it and forget it,\" but it's highly leveraged.\n\nI hope this breakdown is helpful for anyone starting out.\n\n**What's the biggest \"mistake\" you made early in your passive income journey that you wish you could go back and fix?**",

That's *active* emotional and financial work.\n* **Real Estate?** You have to find the deal, secure financing, fix toilets (or manage the property manager who does).\n* **Niche Site?** You have to build it, write content, do SEO, and maintain it.\n* **SaaS/App?** You have to code it, market it, and handle customer support.\n\nWhat we're all chasing is **Leveraged Income**: The ability to de-link our time from our earnings. You do the work *once*, and it continues to pay you 10, 100, or 1000 times over. A blog post you write today can earn ad revenue for 5 years.\n\nCalling it \"passive\" implies no work. Calling it \"leveraged\" respects the (often massive) upfront effort.\n\nChanging my mindset from \"passive\" to \"leveraged\" helped me focus on building *systems and assets*, not just looking for a magic money button.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way?

It wasn‚Äôt a fortune, but it added up to about $100 in a month, and the sales kept coming even when I wasn‚Äôt touching anything.\n\nPhotography used to dominate these platforms, but AI has taken over that space. Right now, the real opportunity is in areas AI still struggles with clean, editable vector designs and motion graphics with transparent backgrounds. Those take real structure and creativity.\n\nIf you‚Äôre new to this, here‚Äôs the foundation that actually matters:\n\n* Learn how to make proper vector files (icons, shapes, or simple illustrations).\n* Learn basic motion graphics  how to move layers and export clean animations.\n* Study what‚Äôs trending in marketplaces before you upload.\n* Be consistent; upload small batches regularly instead of random drops.\n\nI put everything I learned into a short PDF guide that explains the workflow and lessons in detail.  \nIf you‚Äôre interested or want to know how it all works, just DM me.",

I've taught English online, content moderation, worked for Real Estate agents, social media algorithm analysis and now AI training and language processing. (A lot of these jobs and companies aren't available anymore so I really can't guide people to remote work).\nMy college background was in microbiology.¬† None of these fields.\n\n\nI can't tell where AI is going to actually be useful for reducing human workforce jobs (it's failing a lot more than most people realize) but a lot of them will likely be those things people do remotely, such as chat support, coding, administrative tasks, etc. And it's not AI necessarily that is taking away work- it's the cheapskate CEOs wanting to charge the same amount but not pay employees. You'll be looking for those that want to pay for human produced creative output. And competition will be more intense for those jobs. But, as of right now, AI lacks the human aspect to art and creativity so most people can detect as being AI made. But as time goes on it's less and less apparent to the majority of people. There are podcasts, music, commercials and even üåΩ (yes, ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è even that) that is improving every month to where I struggle to tell the difference when a year ago there were major issues. YouTube is saturated with AI created animation and video editing, likely not the best focuses right now.\n\n\nIf you want to work remotely be prepared to do what's needed, such as customer service phone work, and look for project based jobs on some of the bigger sites that will give you experience in multiple fields. It may be contract work with no guarantees or benefits or it might be employee based.\n\n\nIf you want to do creative jobs then you may need to be flexible to working in office. You will be competing against AI and being flexible to working anwhere may be an advantage.¬†\n\n\nFor anyone looking to work remotely and are worried about AI I will say #1-that's a valid concern (I'm literally training myself out of a job) and #2- diversify what you do.¬†\n\n\nNot trying to be a downer at all, I do think AI is limited with artistic and creative fields but it's what the employers and customers will pay for, will they settle for unnatural but cheap but human made and more costly? AI will never have that spark that makes art like a human... Hell even the chatbots acknowledge that.¬†",

I‚Äôd been juggling my 5‚Äì6 job and my passion for building online stores, but I always told myself I needed more time, more knowledge, or the perfect idea before I could really start.\n\nEventually, I realized that ‚Äúwaiting to be ready‚Äù was just another way of procrastinating so I took action. I picked a niche, built my first store, and committed to learning through doing.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt smooth at all.  \nI tested multiple products, redesigned the store more times than I can count, and even faced a few failed ads. But with each setback, I learned something new  from how to identify better products to how customer experience impacts conversion more than flashy design ever could.\n\nThe real turning point came when I started collaborating with a few people who were more experienced than I was. Instead of trying to do everything alone, I learned to build around teamwork, consistent testing, and small daily improvements. That‚Äôs when I began seeing consistent sales and growth not overnight success, but steady, measurable progress.\n\nWhat I‚Äôve learned so far:\n\n* Execution beats endless planning.\n* Collaboration can speed up your learning curve dramatically.\n* Every failure hides a lesson  sometimes, that lesson is worth more than the win itself.\n\nI‚Äôm still learning every day, but looking back, I‚Äôm glad I stopped overthinking and just started.\n\nHas anyone else here experienced that shift  when you moved from planning to actually doing? I‚Äôd love to hear how it changed your results.",

      "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI'm working on my own business for 1.5 years now. Since then I embraced the digital nomad lifestyle somewhat but never fully committed to it. I basically travelled to one place and then ended up back where I started after a couple of months. My issue was that whenever you travel somewhere you are at a metaphorically blank page. If you like that good for you. For me I'm open to meet new people but it's an effort in a city where you never set foot before.\n\nOnce around 3-5 years ago I met a founder called Jan. He had what I would call the solution to this problem which never really left me but I never decided to act on it until today.\n\nHe was living in shared flat somewhere in Berlin with 3-4 other builders in a apartment which had a big living room, workstations setup and was just living the builders life but not in isolation but rather with other like-minded people.\n\nNow I had that every now and then but usually I work from home, sometimes in a co working space but none of these environments are very socially Inducive. As entrepreneur/builder or whatever you wanna call yourself you already commit to a life where you spent most of your time working alone on your idea/agency/projects.\n\nI want to replicate what I experienced a couple of years ago. I created a \"manifesto\" where I describe that experience and my ask is simple: I'm looking for 1-2 entrepreneurs who are open to join this experiment. If you see yourself in this document then hit me up with the contact details seen in the link.\n\nP.S Seems like I can't drop a link here. DM me and I can send you the document.",

      "selftext": "2 years ago, a friend and I started an eCommerce brand and tried the same things as everyone else. We found a product, built a site, ran some paid ads on Facebook and TikTok, and thought we‚Äôd just scale from there. \n\nWe consumed as much content as we could on advertising. All of these eCommerce creators were saying the same things: \n\n‚ÄúYou just have to let the algorithm figure it out and keep spending, it‚Äôll start working eventually‚Äù ‚ÄúIf your ads aren‚Äôt working, it‚Äôs your creatives. Keep testing new ones.‚Äù\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch it! Every time you touch the campaign, it resets the learning phase.‚Äù\n\nBut man‚Ä¶ the results were all over the place. One week we‚Äôd have great days, then the next week sales were dead. Costs kept rising, and if we paused ads for even a day, the traffic dried up instantly. By the end of every month we‚Äôd be lucky to break even. Most of the time we were down quite a bit (I don‚Äôt even want to say how muchüòÇ). \n\nWe knew losing money like that wasn‚Äôt sustainable. Everyone‚Äôs running ads these days, so CPCs have gotten ridiculously high. So we switched gears and started focusing purely on organic traffic: SEO, blog content, community engagement, backlinks, the whole thing. It took longer to get going, but the traffic started stacking. And once it did, it didn‚Äôt stop. Even when we weren‚Äôt actively working on it, sales kept coming in from Google and blog posts we‚Äôd written months earlier.\n\nThat shift literally changed our business. We had consistent sales and after the Christmas rush we decided to sell that brand at the start of the year. Following that exit my friend and I took some time off. After a while we decided that we wanted to create something that helps other brands get the same kind of sustainable, compounding traffic we found with our previous business. \n\nSo we started [TheClickMill.com](https://theclickmill.com). An SEO agency that cuts through all of the crap out there and focuses on what really matters. Getting your brand more clicks and sustainable clicks. Clicks that don‚Äôt go away when you stop paying. Clicks from primed leads that are searching for exactly what you‚Äôre offering. Not some guy who‚Äôs video is getting interrupted by your ad because they searched your keyword a month ago on Google. The clicks we provide come from customers that want to buy what you‚Äôre selling right now.\n\nIf you‚Äôve ever felt stuck paying Meta or Google every month just to stay afloat, we feel you. If you want to break out of that loop and start generating sustainable sales that aren‚Äôt reliant on your wallet then head over to [TheClickMill.com](https://theclickmill.com). We suggest starting with a community mentions package to start generating traffic asap. From there we can work on building up your domain authority and getting you ranked on the first page for a bunch of keywords in your niche with our other services.",

Bezos made a TON of money as an angel investor into Google.\n\nTLDR: In 1998, Amazon acquired a startup called Junglee and the acquisition was basically a disaster. But one of the employees, Ram Shriram, ended up intro‚Äôing Bezos to Larry Page and Sergey Brin. They show him a prototype, and he wrote a $250k check on the spot into their $1M seed round.\n\nFast forward to Google‚Äôs IPO in 2004, that $250k was worth $280M. If he had held on to it, that would have been $20B today (I heard that on the Acquired podcast).\n\nPretty much the reality of investing in startups. If you're already meeting smart people and building relationships, the opportunities show up in your workflow. Not from \"deal hunting.\"",

I know it was the right decision at the time since it was really affecting my confidence and mental health (due to toxic coworker). Still, I wish I had found better ways to cope with the stress back then or ways to manage it better so I could‚Äôve kept that stable monthly income.\n\nBuilding a business now has been even more challenging for my mental health and confidence. But I know this is what I really want to do than work for someone else's dream. But it‚Äôs hard, especially when you‚Äôre surrounded by people with steady jobs. You start feeling like you‚Äôre missing out or doing something wrong, even when you‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs definitely a bit of FOMO.\n\nOne thing I‚Äôve learned is that I will never leave a job again without a backup plan, no matter how much I have saved. I really thought I‚Äôd be fine living off my savings for a while that can sustain me for a year or two, but it‚Äôs different when you don‚Äôt have that regular income. I end up feeling lost, distracted, and constantly doubting myself, questioning whether I‚Äôm doing the right thing.\n\nI used to think that working on my own business full time would help me focus more, since having a job seemed like a distraction. But in reality, the pressure of doing your own thing without seeing results quickly can be overwhelming. Maybe I just need to build a stronger mindset, be more patient, be consistent, practice delayed gratification, but looking back, even during my school days, I was never great at working under pressure - and working on building a business full time is a whole lot of pressure.\n\nHas anyone else left a stable job to chase their dream, only to find it‚Äôs way harder than you expected?\n\nI‚Äôd love to hear your experiences and any lessons you learned along the way.",

          "body": "That mental health pressure you're describing hits different when your entire identity becomes tied to the business succeeding, and honestly most people underestimate how much psychological safety a regular paycheck provides even in toxic situations.\n\nThe thing about entrepreneurship is it amplifies everything - your existing coping mechanisms, your relationship with uncertainty, your self worth issues. If you struggled with pressure in school, jumping into full time founder mode without addressing those underlying patterns was always gonna be rough.\n\nI crashed my first startup pretty hard and had to move back home, but what really helped was developing actual stress management systems instead of just hoping I'd magically become better at handling pressure. Tools like Headspace or Calm for the daily anxiety, but also practical stuff like time blocking so you're not just floating in this endless void of \"work on the business.\"\n\nThe backup plan thing is spot on though. Even successful founders like those behind companies like Buffer or ConvertKit kept their day jobs way longer than their egos wanted to admit. There's this weird mythology that you have to go all in from day one but that's mostly just survivor bias from the few who got lucky.\n\nYour savings runway psychology changes completely when you're burning through it without revenue coming in. Two years sounds like forever until month 3 hits and you realize you haven't made any real progress on the things that actually generate money.",

That way you can put a timeframe on it. I think that having timeframe will help you to not be so hard on yourself by comparing to others. Having a timeframe can possibly help give you enough grace to stay in your own lane. I would say that within those 2 to 3 years just keep working on growth and multiple ways to profit. Once your business hits the 3 year mark and still has not profited, then that is your sign to regroup. I hope this helps a little. It is interesting to hear the many different feedbacks as they are so encouraging throughout this entire thread. However, as a person who has the same desire to take the good leap of faith soon myself, I am almost quite sure that it is easier said than done. All the best of your endeavors!",

A practical move that helps a lot of people: get a flexible, minimum-wage or part-time job while you build the business. It fixes a few things fast and gives you breathing room.\n\nYou‚Äôll stop feeling useless or guilty about not earning.\n\nThe financial 'pressure' eases, so doubt and panic start to dissipate, and time becomes your ally.\n\nA steady routine and even a small income often sharpen focus and make you more productive in the business, not less.\n\nStraightforward steps you can take today:\n\nFind a flexible role with predictable hours, retail, hospitality, temp agencies or short freelance gigs work well. Make sure it's something you can switch off from mentally.\n\nProtect focused startup time: block 10 to 20 hours a week and treat it like non-negotiable work time.\n\nSet short milestones (30 and 90 days) so you can measure progress and adjust/pivot quickly.\n\nYou can always use the job income as runway, not as a reason to slow down: I'd keep it in a separate account altogether and budget to extend your runway.\n\nBuild accountability: weekly check-ins with a friend, mentor, or keep us updated here to keep momentum and reduce second-guessing.\n\nIf you want a quick read, try Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell; it‚Äôs full of useful 'perspectives' on how success actually happens.

      "selftext": "Quick update to my previous posts about the nightmare client situation.\n\nContext: one client makes up $5k per month which is almost half of my revenue. They've been complete chaos, disorganized records, 2am receipt dumps, constant weekend emergencies. I posted asking if I should fire them and Reddit overwhelmingly said raise rates and set boundaries instead.\n\nI sent an email last week raising their rate from $5k to $7.5k per month and included an actual service framework with 10-day submission deadlines, rush fees for last-minute requests, communication hours Monday through Friday 9am-6pm only, and no more weekend work.\n\nThey went silence for a week. I was legitimately convinced they were ghosting me and started mentally preparing for losing half my income. Yesterday they called me and we had this tense 20 mins talk with lots of questions and pushback, but I honestly couldn't tell where it was heading.\n\nThis morning, I got their email response and I'm honestly conflicted about what to do. Screenshot attached.\n\nThey want to move forward but counter offer $7k per month instead of $7.5k. They're also pushing back on the timeline, saying they want to start with 7 business days deadlines instead of 10 and work up to it over the next quarter. And here's the one that's really bothering me, they accept the Monday-Friday 9-6 communication hours but want to discuss exceptions for quarterly filing periods where some weekend work might be necessary. They did acknowledge that they kinda expected this coming given how they've been operating, and they need 90 days to review how it's working. But I'm genuinely torn here.\n\nPart of me says take the deal because I won the principle, $7k is still a 40% increase, and some of their pushback seems reasonable for a transition period. Part of me says hold firm because I set $7.5k for a reason, that quarterly exception language feels like the exact slippery slope back to weekend chaos, and they're already negotiating boundaries before even accepting them. I'm leaning more towards the take the deal part.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/57jxtujji6yf1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=deb53723b067c6ddadac9b593edf1b46a22dc38f\n\n",

      "selftext": "# \"Comfort is the worst addiction\" - Marcus Aurelius\n\nI think some of you might relate to this, some of you might learn from my mistakes.\n\nSince I was 15-16 years old I did every business model you can think of: forex, stock trading, affiliate marketing, SEO blogs, dropshipping, customer acquisition/lead generation agency, CPA marketing, SMMA, POD, Amazon FBA, Amazon Merch, Amazon KDP... you name it. I wasn't afraid of work, I wasn't afraid of risk, I was disciplined.\n\nBut in 2020 everything collapsed around me.\n\n* My Amazon KDP account got banned (how I was earning money at that time)\n* I broke up with my girlfriend\n* One of my closest friends and my accountability partner passed away\n\nI still had around $150k saved up, so financially I was comfortable, that's where my life really fell apart.\n\nI though I'll have a few months off to reset, but that turned into five years of comfort, depression, procrastination and avoidance. Having no pressure and no accountability I sliped into all the easiest escaped of all, video games, distractions, mindless media, short dopamine hits, ZERO DISCIPLINE. I told myself \"I would start again tomorrow\", \"...next week\", ...next month\"...\n\nComfort was my drug. The worst part is that it didn't feel harmful at the time, but it was killing my ambition.\n\nThen life hit me again. In early 2024, a series of unexpected expenses wiped me down to \\~$15k and shortly after, I got hit with a fine from an old dropshippping project where my business partner screwed me over. I went from comfortable... to broke... to in debt.\n\nBut that pain made me wake up. It brought back the hunger that comfort had stolen from me.\n\nI returned to Amazon KDP with purpose and I managed to build a decent business and because of it I am going to pay off my debt by the end of this year.\n\nI'm sharing this because some of you are in the exact danger zone that I lived in. Enough comfort to survive, not enough pain to change, slowly dying inside while calling it \"rest\", \"balance\" or \"taking time\".  \nComfort isn't rest, it is a cage with pillows.\n\nSo if you're building your business now, procrastinating your next project or thinking about quitting.¬†**LEAN INTO THE DISCOMFORT**. That is where all the progress lives.\n\nI wasted 5 years of my life learning this the hard way. I just hope that even one person who reads this, avoids the same trap that got me.",

I feel like a lot of people give it a lot of different names But the one I've liked the most is. **thinking on a long time horizon** or \"***What will the actions I've done today get me, multiplied by two years? Where will i be? What will i have?\"*** It helps you realize that all you really are is a series of inputs and actions. I'm not saying you can't enjoy video games, Or even enjoy a TV show and so on. But it's the level of severity that matters, Playing an hour of a video game after a long stay of work can feel fantastic. We're playing 6 to 8 hours for eight days in a row? Where will that get you in two years? But if you look at your life as merely actions that will eventually amount to something, it can make things clear On what you'll need to do to increase the percentage chance you'll succeed or have the life you want. and when you think about it like that, **the game of life becomes clear**. In order to play the game you need to ***flip the coin as many times as possible***, Knowing full well you'll fail. The second thing you'll need is an ***understanding of how to flip the coin In a better way***, The aggregation of skills. The last thing you'll need ***is a long enough time horizon*** Where all your effort compounds and you can win a majority of the time.   \n\\~Alas, it's easier said than done. Good luck to all to play this game of life!",

I wrote all the code myself and know it really well.   I'm totally maxxed out but I'm doing it without debt or investors and the biggest organization in the niche is interested.  I had a part time contract employee this year to test the waters and he was absolutely brilliant but also has seasonal affective disorder and ODD and was hard to manage and he can't work between November and April his brain and motivation just collapse as the light goes so it's back to me...   Main issue at the mo' is I'm in California and want to hop back over to border to Oregon before scaling due to just a bit easier regulatory environment but would have to sell my house to do that to create a new domicile so just being in the discomfort of small town isolation while I build more base...

LinkedIn is drowning in them. Twitter is full of \"building in public\" threads. But here's what's strange: actual product launches haven't increased proportionally. Neither have real SaaS companies reaching profitability.\n\nWhat we *have* seen is an explosion of:\n\n* Productivity tools for founders\n* Communities for founders\n* Courses teaching founders\n* Newsletters about founding\n* Tools to help founders build tools\n\nThe picks-and-shovels game has never been better. Why? Because the identity of \"founder\" has become more appealing than the reality of building a product. It's easier to buy a course about validating ideas than to actually talk to 50 potential customers. It's more comfortable to join a community than to write cold emails.\n\nThis isn't criticism, it's market observation. If you're actually building something real, you're now competing in a space where most \"competitors\" are just role-playing. And if you're selling tools to founders, you've found a market that's growing faster than the actual problems they're meant to solve.\n\nThe question is: which side of this do you want to be on?",

That huge market you described the one buying tools to solve problems they don't even have yet, here‚Äôs what. They all eventually hit the RevOps Failure Cascade. That's the moment their forecast becomes a lie, their teams start battling, and they realize the tools don't talk to each other. We don't sell the tool. We sell the certainty that the whole damn system won't break when you need it most. That's the only way to build a real company in this market.

Whether they can be called a founder should be judged by whether they have created something valuable.\n\n\n\nI see many people pursuing founder status as a form of self-PR and a desire to promote their products. However, this approach should be completely opposite. Before your product is released, excessive PR can make you impetuous, lose yourself, and forget what's truly important. For a product, when it's not truly ready, premature PR will bring low value and ROI.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the excessive obsession with the identity of the founder is caused by premature PR, but premature PR has low value and ROI for both individuals and products.",

      "selftext": "I was a technical recruiter at a mid-size agency for 4 years. Good at my job, consistently hit quota, but watching the company take 85% of my placements was killing me. I was generating maybe 400k in fees annually and taking home 60k plus a 35k bonus.\n\nDecided to go independent in late 2023. Scary as hell because i didn't have established clients and wasn't trying to start a whole agency with overhead and employees.\n\nFound a marketplace model where i could access companies that were already looking for recruiters. Started taking roles in my specialty (devops and platform engineering), and focused on actually placing people instead of doing business development.\n\nMonth 1-3 was slow. Made maybe 4k total because i was still learning how to work independently and building reputation on the platform.\n\nMonth 4-8 started clicking. Placed 2-3 people per month, income jumped to 15-20k monthly.\n\nMonth 9-18 has been consistent. Averaging 18k per month, placed 31 people total. Some months are 25k, some are 12k, but it averages out.\n\nWhat's different: i work 30 hours a week instead of 50. I only take roles i actually want to work on. No more weekly team meetings or having to hit arbitrary quotas. I pick my own schedule.\n\nDownsides: no benefits, have to figure out my own health insurance and retirement. Income can swing month to month. Some months i don't place anyone.\n\nWould i go back? Absolutely not. Even with the uncertainty, making 3x what i made before and controlling my time is worth it.",

If it makes you feel better... add yourself in a bonus every few months. You make enough money to do that. PTO... take some time off when you want, you make enough to do that... plus, you already work 20 hours less a week so that is over a weeks vacation right there.

A few missed payments, miscommunication over who owned what and suddenly everyone remembered things differently. I had to learn the hard way that paperwork doesn‚Äôt kill trust it protects it.   \nNow, every deal, every partnership, even small projects it all goes in writing. It makes things smoother and honestly saves friendships too.  \nAnd I‚Äôve kind of started seeing it the same way in my personal life.

      "selftext": "Long story short, over the past decade or so, my mom built a nail business. At the moment she's a nail technician as well, and also takes on the manager role (maintenance, supplies, etc), and she's built up clientele and the like, to the point where she herself is pulling in $300k+ profit herself a year. The thing is, she plans to sell the spot in a couple years, and plans to sell it someone else who will take over it as a nail salon business, but for some reason in her mind it's ingrained to sell it simply at the cost of the location (not accounting for the cost of the business she built up, etc). Is this a bad idea on her part in her opinion? I definitely don't want to think for her, but I was curious about what you guys think\n\n  \nEdit: the new owner would just take on the name and clients, and she'll no longer be in the nail business",

That's usually 2-3x sde. 600k-900k.\nFor bigger businesses, it's ebitda. This is when you really take into account mgmt...but also get higher multiples. \n\nAt 300k/yr profit/sde...you can absolutely hire a great nail salon manager. And still probably take home 200k.\n\nLet's call the purchase price 1mm (which is prob high). That costs you about 12k/month if you go sba and put 0 down. So 144k annual debt service, 100k for manager. You net 56k profit. That's how you know biz has value.\n\nReal estate is real estate and should be valued separately from business. Highest and best use might not be a nail salon...but keeps your rent costs fixed for the most part and likely makes that 300k profit grow over years.\n\nShort version: hire a small biz broker that's sold nail salons. They will tell you what's market in your area and financials.",

As a potential owner, I am looking only at the profit from the other nail techs, if the current owner works, Ill add 40% of their earnings minus 20% (to account for tips) to the profit calculation. Then Ill look at the size of the salon, and the condition of the salon, and location of the salon. In particular I want to know how many nail techs there are in the salon, how many are staying. The more nail techs the more valuable the business. Also I want to know how many pedicures chairs the salon has, and the condition of the pedicure chairs. A pedicure chair can cost up to 10k to install plus the cost of the chair itself 1.5 to 4k. If the if the salon's chairs and furniture are too old that would decrease the value. \n\nYou haven't really given much valuable information to determine a prize. It could be as low as 100k or as high as 500k. You won't get 3x profits like some others suggest. My current place makes me 250k and I bought for 80k, I hope to sell it for 100k in a couple of years.",

If she has a longer-term lease locked in, this has value, especially for someone who wants to continue substantially the same business if there's a built-up clientele.  One assumes many of the techs and other employees would be willing to stay on with any reasonable new owner, so this really is a turnkey business your mom is handing over. \n\nIf the lease is short-term and there aren't clean renewal options at a fixed or structured price, she has a decision to make:  does she want to walk away without being able to sell it for too much, or would she want to get the landlord to agree to a lease extension, or option, that would enable her to bundle the sale per above.\n\nIf she owns the building, she should keep the building and become a landlord to the new owner, at the very least. Landlords in this situation have a lot of leverage, so even if she sells the business itself below market, then she could make up for it in time through reasonable rent increases.  \n\nIf owns but is planning to sell the building, my advice to you is, buy it and offer the new salon owner a long-term lease on terms that work for you both!   Even if you have to pay you mom back over time or something.  Then you can be the landlord per above.",

Equipment assets depreciate and during an ownership transfer clients tend to leave the business due to tech loyalty, not brand loyalty. Most salons tried to make as much cash as possible and not everyone has a good track record of proper bookkeeping making it hard to go through bank loans for the sale. Hence why it's more of a cash price and whatever is deemed decent in terms of assets and client list.

The clients are tied to her and there‚Äôs a high probability they‚Äôre there for her and not the business. She hasn‚Äôt successfully replaced herself in the business. The business may not even be able to afford replacing her.

Otherwise, to a random buyer it‚Äôs fairly risky. If they know what they‚Äôre doing, they are unlikely to want to pay more money for more than the location. With a long enough training/support period (as in your mom helping with the transition of the clients to the new owner) and good terms it could work for a random buyer though. \n\nI‚Äôd say there‚Äôs value to the business (separate from the real estate), but you probably want to do some work to prep it prior to a sale to make it more valuable and expand your buyer pool.",

I have about 250 Instagram followers, don't have a TikTok account, and my Facebook Group has about 50 members. \n\nHowever, I make about $15k-$17k a month (full-time, started as a side hustle, walked away from the 9-5 in 2022), and I'm trending towards $20k months in the near future. \n\nHere's what I've learned. People put WAY too much stock in attention (follows and likes). What's FAR more important is building trust with people. I was listening to a podcast recently, and Seth Godin said something that I love. \n\nI'm probably paraphrasing here, but he said \"Marketing is telling a true story to people who want to hear it, and creating a story that people want to spread. \"Likes\" doesn't mean anyone likes you, \"friends\" doesn't mean they're your friend, and \"followers\" doesn't mean they're following you. What you have to do is figure out how to matter.\" - Seth Godin. \n\nWhat works for me is building strong, 1:1 relationships with as many people as I can. And helping people, with no expectation of anything in return. Find people's specific pain points, and help them solve a problem. \n\nI'm going to give you a very recent example....   \n  \nI commented on someone's Reddit post the other day... it was just my heartfelt attempt to help someone who was struggling. \n\nA guy read my comment and thought, \"I have to talk to him! He's speaking directly to what I'm going through.\" But then, as he told me later, he accidentally closed the Reddit window and couldn't find the post or the comment. He said she started to panic. But then he remembered that he had opened a separate window from my Reddit bio and was able to reach me.   \n  \nHe reached out and booked a call with me. We talked for over an hour, and he's now a coaching client. I didn't do any marketing, and there was no promotion on my part. I didn't even try to pitch him on my coaching services. But after spending an hour on the phone with me (for free), he was like \"I need to work with you\". \n\nAnyways, my point is... find ways to help people solve a real problem they are struggling with, one person at a time. \n\nFocus on trust, not attention!",

If your target people only buy from TikTokkers, scratch that business (or target) off the list and keep looking until you find a target market you can address in ways that you are particularly good at (or can fake it until you hire).\n\nI did well when I started an IT services business because I knew what I was doing, had a solid pedigree from my previous employer and contacts which I'd been building for years. I attended networking events (think of rotary, or your local chamber of commerce), which lead to a lot of top of funnel opportunity because there I could find my target market - small and mid sized business owners.

Concentrated mode is dedicated to application of your business ideas when you know what to do. But new ideas are seldomly born in this mode. \nAnd there is a diffused mode. When Aha moments come. Aha moment is when your brain idles. Idling is not equal thoughtless social media scrolling. \nFor example Thomas Edison, when he was out of ideas, he took metal ball, sit at the table with metal plate, and did .... nothing. \nIn your business endeavors, make sure that both modes of your brain are used: phocused and diffused. Otherwise, as was already mentioned, burnout awaits on you. \nAnd one more, read about Eisenhower matrix.",

Easily save thousands of dollars we used to spend on contractors and a lot of time trying to coordinate stuff between teams!\n* Cursor/Windsurf: These help everyone in our engineering team write code atleast 2x faster. That's atleast $10k in savings per month I guess!\n* Frizerly: we used to hire freelancers on Upwork to do keyword research and blogs for our website to improve our Google ranking! Now their AI automates all of that for us! That's about $2k saved every month!\n* Google Nano Banana/AI Studio: Great to create marketing assets like photoshoots, change colors of products etc. This again is money we used to pay freelancers saved, on top of time ig!\n\nCurious what others have found as well!",

I would love to hear what others have found but here are two that I often find people overlook\n\nI often find businesses either not using the blogs feature on their website or writing blogs without an intent.  With proper keyword planning using your Google Search Console data, blogs can help your website show up as top result for various queries people are searching for! These days with AI tools like Frizerly and Pulse that can automate both keyword research and drafting the blog itself, it's a no-brainer! Free organic traffic for life in the long run if you are consistent imo!\n\nSimilarly find the subreddits and forums your customers hang out and be an active participant there. Genuinely add value. I suggest not ever adding links but instead honestly plug your brand/company name when it makes sense. This does not only get people currently on that thread but these often show up on google search results bringing more customers over time",

          "body": "Honestly, it's simple. The low hanging fruit is showing up where your audience already is. A lot of people think they have to start their own blogs/websites without realizing that to be able to get traffic with their website, they need to build authority and promote their content so they can then rank higher on search engines and get long term exposure that way.  \n  \nSEO isn't something you focus on at the begining, it's something you start doing as you scale up. Instead, what I like doing is using SparkToro to see where my audience is and then join relevant communities. Also, I like doing a competitive analysis to find gaps I can fill, targeting low competition topics first.\n\nFor example, say I'm in the cybersecurity industry and want to get more exposure. The first thing I'd do is search on SparkToro. According to SparkToro, the social networks most used by searchers of cybersecurity are:\n\n1. Github\n2. LinkedIn\n3. X\n\nIn that order. Meaning, me joining Facebook or Instagram would be a bit of a waste of time (or at the very least more expensive to reach the same audience). After all, those aren't the platforms people go to to learn more about cybersecurity.\n\nNow that I now which platforms to target, I'd research problems I can solve and content I can create. Tools like Ahrefs help you find keywords (topics) with low competition or at the very least, keywords you can compete for (taking advantage of the massive authority Github, LinkedIn and X have).\n\nThen it'd be a matter of filtering those keywords to spot the topics that actually have business value. Just because something has low competition, doesn't mean we should waste our time creating content around it. You need to know your target persona so you can create content specific for them.\n\nFocus on solving problems, not selling your products or services. What I mean is, your product or service should be a part of the solution to the problem they have, you shouldn't hard sell.\n\nLet me give you an example. Say you are selling antivirus software and the problem you seek to solve is removing malware specifically from browsers. You could target a topic like: \"How to remove the Yahoo search redirect virus\"\n\nAt that point, you'd know your target audience is someone who isn't very technical and is likely someone older, around 40-50 years old. Then you can write your copy using a copywriting framework like PAS (Problem - Agitate - Solution).\n\nYou can say something like:\n\n&gt;I had the same problem two years ago. I tried to search for stuff on Google but it would automatically redirect me to Yahoo to a random page. The biggest problem was I didn't know what was happening, but I talked to a friend who is more tech savvy and he recommended I do the following.  \nFirst, download the \\[product\\] extension. \\[this would be your product\\]  \nThen create an account and... \\[continue with the explanation\\]\n\nThat's it. After that, it's just a matter of promoting it. No matter how good your content is, if nobody sees it, it's useless. If you don't have an audience, use advertising to reach your target audience. Just promote the content you created in the platform you know you audience already hanges out in.\n\nThis is a bit of an oversimplification but that's what I'd do. It works every time for getting leads and selling products and services.",

You go onto Semrush and find most high volume keywords within the niche are low competition and much easier to rank for than say, a reporting SaaS software. \n\nPlus it is not too difficult to use AI and semrush to do great, relevant keyword research and then a tool such as Wincher ($30/month - cheap) to optimize your various landing pages for the best keywords.

      "selftext": "**A bit of context**  \nI have been building mobile apps for a long time. I also ran an agency in Europe that shipped consumer apps. In the last two years I learned as much as in the eight years before. Consumer can work, but it is hard. There is a lot of competition. Many teams are funded. Good branding and design matter. Ads and store strategy matter. Vibecoding helps with speed, but it does not give you product sense or design skills. Most solo builders don‚Äôt have all of that.\n\n**What this is about**  \nI started building internal mobile apps for small businesses. These apps are private. The icon has their logo. The data is theirs. The app runs one important job their team does every day. Owners can build it. Or a builder can build it for them. The value is simple: fewer mistakes, faster hand-offs, cleaner records, money collected sooner.\n\n**What the apps do, in plain terms**  \nField work: the worker arrives, taps ‚Äústart,‚Äù takes photos, collects a signature, taps ‚Äúdone,‚Äù and the invoice is sent.  \nStudios and salons: bookings are kept in one place, reminders go out on time, no double booking.  \nShops and wholesalers: scan items, update stock, get a clean export for accounting.  \nForms and compliance: fill forms offline, require all fields, get a signed PDF saved in the right folder.\n\n**Pricing and learning to watch**  \nSome platforms look cheap, then get expensive with seats, credits, or add-ons. Read what counts as usage. Check if you can export the project. Check who owns the data. Test the tool before paying. Plan time to learn it. One focused week now is cheaper than rebuilding later.\n\n**What must be solid**  \nThese are utility apps. One core feature must work every time.  \nIf the core is booking, the app must not lose state.  \nIf the core is notifications, they must arrive on time.  \nIf the core is inventory, scans must be reliable.  \nIf the core is forms, offline must work and signatures must stick.  \nNice screens do not fix broken behavior.\n\n**Ownership and scope**  \nKeep the brand of the business. Icon, splash, wording. Keep the data with the business. Keep roles simple. Decide if the app is only for staff or also for clients to see status or book. Fewer options means more use.\n\n**A simple way to build and improve**  \nMake a small version that runs end to end. Put it on the phones of the people who do the job. Watch where they get stuck. Fix the biggest problem. Ship again. Repeat once or twice. When it feels smooth for them, brand it fully and roll it out.\n\n**How to build**  \nI am technical, and for this kind of job I would not use Cursor. I would pick a mobile-focused vibecoding platform with three qualities: a good code model that handles real app logic (not only UI), built-in help for store tasks like signing, builds, TestFlight or internal testing, and App Store and Play submission, and clear pricing that stays reasonable without surprise per-seat or credit spikes. I use Vibecode App. It is free to start, the credit system is fair, and it is easy to ramp up. Whatever you choose, test navigation, state, auth, and push on real devices before you commit.\n\n**How to charge**  \nCharge a monthly fee that includes support and small improvements. Add a setup fee if there are integrations or data migration. Be clear on what is included. No surprise bills.\n\n**Reddit can help**  \nSpend time where your users talk. Read pain posts. Do not spam. Good places to start:¬†smallbusiness, salons, truckers etc (there is a TON). Search for ‚Äúno-show,‚Äù ‚Äúdouble booking,‚Äù ‚Äúinventory count,‚Äù ‚Äúinvoice delay.‚Äù Build the fix they describe.\n\n**Last tip**  \nIn many industries, just saying ‚Äúwe have a mobile app‚Äù still helps, even if the first version is simple. It opens doors. Then you earn trust by making one workflow work very well.",

But the truth is ***most people don't know what they want***, but what most people want Is to see *\"any signal\"* That you are **trustworthy, Loyal, And a safe bet**. And you can signal many of those things By simply **showing up and being a positive force** in whatever they're doing. This can be as simple as finding three people in your industry, across whatever platform you desire, discord, LinkedIn, Hell even Twitter. and then consistently reaching out to them on their posts, encouraging, offering your perspective in a positive way, and sometimes even trying to offer value, But I find encouragement works the best. If you persistently do this for around three weeks, *then they'll start to notice you*, And so long as what you ask for is reasonable and at a small enough level, Many will offer you a helping hand because of your encouragement. (Think: Hi \\_\\_\\_\\_, I am Starting to Build my First Webpage, could i tap into your experience and could I show you &amp; could you tell me if i\"m on the right track?) then After they do that small ask, **offer them a list of thing your willing to help them with Because of what they've done for you**, make sure it is a list of thing they might find valuable. *The funny thing is they might never take you up on any of these things*, But what you've done is shown that you're willing to reciprocate, That when something is done for you, you are fully open to doing something for them and in turn this **builds trust, loyalty, And assures them that you're a safer bet** than a stranger when they might need a favor. It's also just a really good method of building rapport with anybody.... \n\nI know this is a more analytical Approach than you might have been looking for, but being an overly emotional person such as myself, I find things are almost always simpler when you break them down to the actions you need to take, And why those actions result in a meaningful connection with another person. it makes things clearer and more easy to act upon.   \n\\~Anyways I hope this was helpful my friend, please take care and good luck in your journey to make connections!",

Find a niche Industry(It helps to narrow down your ideal customer base even if you can serve a wider audience)\n2. Find where they hangout Reddit, LinkedIn, etc\n3. Signup for freelance work websites like upwork,etc (start with 2,3 popular and trusted ones)\n\nNow comes trust which will be your biggest entry barrier in any field. To build trust\n1. Reddit- start posting and commenting on your niche sub reddit(genuine help is what you are supposed to do, do not sell your services, remember you are here to build trust)\n2. Linkedin- start posting 3x a week for 2 months, see what kind of posts are working and then double down on it, your post should resonate with your ideal customer base.\nWhile you do that you can simultaneously start approaching people on LinkedIn and people on sub reddits if they require your services. What their immediate pain points are that you can resolve with your skill set.\nRemember while you create content you are supposed to engage with other people's content especially who are doing well in your field of service.\n\nApproach method:\nStart DM ing people who interact with your post and introduce yourself and what you do, do not sell them anything, yet. Once you have little trust and they know you you can ask them about what their pain points are that you can resolve for them with your skill sets. Most people will be open to discussing it since you are not an unknown character for them now.\n\nStart with this first then you will understand, improve and make your own strategies as you go \n\nPS- Think of this as a starter kit so you are not lost while you take the first step.",

Lead times still suck but at least these companies actually answer their phones.\n\nPlacing smaller orders with 3 different suppliers now instead of putting all eggs in one basket. Expensive lesson but whatever, live and learn.\n\nBlack Friday is still probably shot but maybe I can salvage something for December. Thanks for the reality check everyone.",

      "selftext": "I‚Äôm running a small startup from korea with around 10 people. revenue is $80k a month, and the company has grown about 10√ó compared to a year ago without external investment.\n\nBut as the business grew, I realized there‚Äôs another kind of problem. I am becoming more lonely. I‚Äôm in my mid-30s and have spent almost a decade coding and building startups, mostly alone. I have 2 years experience in a company as a employee but most of my career is working as a solo freelancer developer.\n\nAlso, I‚Äôm not married, and I‚Äôve never really been a social person. I have a couple of friends, but they‚Äôre all married and busy, so we rarely see each other.\n\nNow that the company has 10 people, I actually feel more isolated. The more we grow, the heavier the decisions and responsibilities get. I can‚Äôt really talk about these things with my employees, and there aren‚Äôt many people around me who would understand.\n\nI just want to stay focused on building a better product, but lately it feels like my personal struggles are growing faster than the company. Sometimes I wonder, is this deep loneliness just part of being a founder? Or am I doing something wrong?\n\nIt‚Äôs starting to affect my weekends. Instead of learning or doing something meaningful, I waste time playing games or doing nothing. My focus is fading, and I‚Äôm honestly scared that if this keeps up, it might start hurting the company too.\n\nI don‚Äôt know how to deal with this. Any advice would mean a lot.\n\n*(P.S. Last time I posted something similar, I got a bunch of DMs from people offering ‚Äúconsulting sessions.‚Äù Most of them were just ads. Please don‚Äôt do that this time.)*",

Today, I have a girlfriend, and she and my family are practically all of my relationships. Since I was 16, I've always worked hard and relied on the fact that professional success would solve everything else. But today, I realize that managing your social relationships is exactly like running a small business. The currency is replaced by laughter, attention, a shared moment, and without that, it becomes increasingly difficult to move forward internally. So I think it's up to us to make the effort (at first) until it becomes natural again to surround ourselves with the right people.

Having a reserve set aside for the \"famine\" periods helps, as does signing clients up for recurring work.\n\nThere's also going to be natural slumps in the cycles of any business, and they're often somewhat predictable. January is a traditional slow month, for example, because everyone is just getting back from the holidays and the new year's budget approvals aren't in yet.

Far easier said than done, I know, but try and make doing that a priority, and it will help.",

But I still see this period as \"establishing my roots\".  Every single customer you do work for, could potentially call you again or recommend to you someone else.  Might not be soon, could be that one customer you serviced will call you again in 3 years, but the more customers you do work for the more people out there will know who you are.  \n\nI got into the habit of requesting reviews when I send invoices receipts, and following up with customers a few weeks to a month after servicing them.

      "selftext": "\n\nI run a small residential roofing company (just me + 4 guys, doing around $40k/month) and there's one competitor who's always been our biggest rival in the area. We're cordial at supply shops but definitely competing for the same jobs.\n\nLast week I found out (through our shared insurance broker, long story) that they've been straight up lying to clients about having a general contractor's license. Like they claim to be \"fully licensed and insured\" on their website, truck wraps, everywhere. But they're not. At all. Never have been. I checked the state licensing board myself - nothing under their business name or the owner's name.\n\nThe kicker? Three of their current clients are homeowners I gave quotes to in the last 6 months and lost the job to them. One lady SPECIFICALLY told me she went with them because \"they seemed more legit with all their certifications\" and she felt safer. These are $15k-30k jobs btw.\n\nNow I'm sitting here like... do I say something? Part of me wants to send a \"hey just fyi\" message to those homeowners because like, if something goes wrong on their roof and the guy has no license, their homeowner's insurance might not cover it?? But another part of me feels like that's sketchy territory and I'll just look like a salty competitor trying to poach clients.\n\nMy lead guy says absolutely not, \"let karma handle it\" and it'll eventually blow up in their face anyway. My wife thinks I have a moral obligation to say something, especially since unlicensed work can void warranties and insurance claims.\n\nBut also like... they're literally breaking the law and winning contracts because of it. In our state you NEED a contractor's license for jobs over $10k. This isn't just shady, it's straight up illegal, right?\n\nThe thing that's really eating at me is one of those clients is an elderly couple on a fixed income who scraped together money for a roof replacement. They're getting scammed by someone who might leave them with zero recourse if something goes wrong. That one bugs me the most.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? What did you do? I'm losing sleep over this and honestly just need some outside perspective from people who get it.",

          "body": "Yelp does exist because it primarily falls under the legal umbrella of free speech and public opinion. The platform definitely positions itself as a public forum where consumers can share their experiences. These experiences can be good, bad, or sometimes even fabricated. And this is because it's all user-generated content. We need to understand that Yelp isn't held directly liable for what users post under Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act. In simple terms we can say that they do provide the megaphone, but not the message. I would say it's perfectly legal for anyone to create a review of a business listing, even without the owner's consent, as long as the content doesn't meet the legal definition of defamation. So while Yelp's survival might seem insane to many of us, it's definitely not illegal. We should understand that it's just internet, unfiltered and unregulated.\n\nYou can ask your customers to share their experiences on yelp and this should help boost the review score. If you look at the review pages of largest companies in the world you will realise that the percentage of negative review is more then positive ones. This is primarily because happy customers usually do not care about leaving review. Fear is not reality. You will have so many positive reviews and just in some time that negative review will go down and your profile will shine again.\n\nSearch for Delete Yelp Reviews on google there are some sites that offer such services.\n\nI hope this helps.",

File a case in small claims court against Yelp and the villain then file discovery motions with Yelp regarding what they have for the listing. You may have to follow up with the ISP to identify the villain if they used a fake name. In most small claims courts, you need permission from the judge but they will likely grant your request if it's reasonable. Yelp will not like being sued and probably delete the information and block the villain.\n\nThis shouldn't take too long. File the case, request permission from the judge, file discovery, and go to court if necessary. If you drop the case against Yelp, then you can still go after the villain if you want compensation and revenge. I don't know how you prove damages but Google should have some guidance. \n\nIf you get a judgment against the villain, then collecting is another process but they can be forced to a deposition to provide their banking information and other assets. If they are a no show for this deposition, this will be civil contempt of court and they will have a warrant for their arrest. I believe they sit in jail until they comply or make bail promising to show. \n\nLiens and wage garnishment are yet another step in the process after deposition. You can attach their bank account and go after their wages and other eligible assets which another step in the paperwork process. Homesteads are generally exempt so you can't file a lien against it.\n\nThe best part about your case is these are what are known as intentional torts which cannot be discharged through bankruptcy. The villain is stuck with it forever and it's earning interest at the statutory rate which is 6% in my state.\n\nThis is an undertaking but if you have a penchant for revenge, you can go after the villain.",

The work is steady and ive built up a solid clientele the past 6 years. \n\nPart of the job sometimes involves getting calls from farmers ive never dealt with inquiring about my prices etc. Cue sketch ball McGee. (SB for short)\n\nI get a call from a farmer not in my territory, which was a red flag. My service isnt super unique. You travel and hour or two any direction and you find another of me thats happy to do the work. Why wasn't he calling them?\n\nSays he cant get anyone to spread ag lime for him. Red flag #2. Has 120 acres he wants a whopping 4 tons to the acre. (Note, 1-2 tons an acre is most common, 3 is max if the ph is awful). \nI say sure ill do whatever you want. Asks for a quote, get him one, $30 a ton for purchasing the lime, trucking and spreading. $120/acre. He says sure sounds good. Start anytime. \n\nNow normally with my usual farmers this is no big deal. I spread, pay all the inputs, then bill them for all materials plus my time on top. Never had an issue. But something was off with him, but at the same time if he was real this was a big profit job. My dad whose much wiser than me told me to ask him for half up front. \"Tell him this is standard procedure with new clients.\" So I did. Dude said ok ill get back you. Never heard from again. Dodged a bullet i think. \n\nNow I know why no one in his area would work with him. ",

Everything was great until about six months ago or so.\n\nWe have a shared business account but we both also use our personal cards for business stuff pretty regularly cuz if you're at home depot or whatever it's very normal to use whatever card is in your wallet. The problem is that he's just TERRIBLE about telling me what he bought or sending receipts.\n\nLast month I'm going through our bank statements and I see all these random Venmo transactions I don't recognize at all. Turns out he's been paying contractors in cash and venmoing himself reimbursements without documenting anything. When I asked him about it he got defensive and said I should 'trust him' and that I should not worry about it which is fucking crazy because I don't have a single bill screenshot nothing to know what was paid\n\n We've been friends for 15 years but I also need to know where our money is going because I've worked so fucking hard for this business and I barely get 6 hours of sleep every SINGLE day (including weekends) for it to work. We're not a lemonade stand we have actual obligations and I'm pretty sure our accountant is going to murder us at tax time.\n\nThe worst incident was two weeks ago. He bought a 3.8k piece of equipment that we'd talked about but hadn't decided on yet. He just bought it. Using his personal card btw and he didn't mention it at all. I found out because the company that sold it called OUR business line asking about delivery and I had no idea what they were talking about and I had to play dumb on the phone\n\nWhen I confronted him he said he saw a good deal and didn't want to bother me and now I'm the asshole for being upset about an unauthorized 3.8k purchase? He says I'm being controlling and acting like his mom.\n\nI don't want to ruin our friendship but I also just can't run a business like this. Have any of you dealt with this? How do you set up financial boundaries with a business partner without making it weird?  \n  \nI'm sorry everyone for the long post but I'm not sure how to solve this and just keep the friendship at the same time",

We capture clear action items on what to do next and make sure we both agree. Weekly has worked well for us. And we capture discussion points throughout the week for our next meeting and just bang them out quickly over 30 minutes.\n\nThere will be times when someone can't wait for the next meeting to make a big decision. In that case, you either need to have clear predefined/agreed upon roles for what sorts of decisions people can make solo. But you also need a mechanism for how to handle emergent issues. That's like just a text saying \"hey, need 5 minutes to discuss doing X.\" \n\n---\n\nFYI: that word _mechanism_ is key. You need an agreed upon way to handle decisions and what process you will follow. You want it to be consistent, repeatable, and clear to both people. Keep it light weight, especially if you are still getting the company stable. If he pushes back on this stuff, say you need to be in the loop on all company decisions as it helps you make better decisions as things shift. If he doesn't get that, then he isn't really interested in building a business... \n\n---\n\n&gt; When I confronted him he said he saw a good deal and didn't want to bother me and now I'm the asshole for being upset about an unauthorized 3.8k purchase?

I'm going to give you a basic rubric for a conversation, and I think you should think about using this when you're talking to your friend.\n\nWhat I'm going to tell you is a brief and incomplete synopsis of the book \"Rapport: the four ways of reading people\". The title is a misnomer - It's actually the result of two PhD psychologists studying terrorists to try and interrogate them better. They found a way of having conversations that keeps people in difficult conversations without them tapping out. It turns out that it works on terrorists, it works on teenagers, it works on my fiance now wife and it works on the people I have to interview for work. \n\nThe fundamentals of this kind of conversation are HEAR. Honestly, Empathy, a respect for Autonomy, and Reflect what you hear. \n\nFor example, the conversation may sound like this.\n\n\"Hi Jim. Listen, we have to talk about something. First, I want to tell you that I hate this kind of conversation - we've known each other for forever, and I feel like I'm picking a fight with one of my best friends, and that's not my intent (Honesty). I can imagine how what I'm about to say will make you feel too - as I said, It's not my intent to pick a fight or nothing (empathy). The fact is that this business can't be ran without better communication on purchases and expenses. The problem isn't the paying contractors in cash or you fronting the money, the problem is that there's no records, and that you've made some big purchases on your own. Let's talk about the first one. I don't think you're stealing anything, but there are tax implications and liability implications as well, plus it makes things 10 times harder to handle accounting on the back end, and we need to be sure we're making money. I know that it's paperwork, but at the minimum you need to be putting invoice numbers for every time you do a venmo transaction, and there can only be one invoice per transaction. Let's talk about the second one - That $3,800 is a big expense for a business like ours. I know we talked about it, but That is x weeks profit for our business.  There should have been consensus.\n\nNow I know what you're going to say. First, I'm not your mom. I don't do laundry, and in any case I'm more like your wife - The shit that you do affects me too. I can't make you work with me on these issues, but I hope to make you see that they actually are issues that affect profit and how we run this business going forward. I want to be able to keep working with you on this until we sell out and retire at 35 (respect for autonomy). What do you think? Do you think these are problems, and do you think there's anything needs to be done about them?\"\n\nThat turned into more of the wall of text then I wanted, but you get the idea. I recommend picking up that book and giving it a skim (It's highly repetitive in places), because the reason I can't give you a complete synopsis is that you need a diagram in the book. Anyway, good luck.",

We never had a real partnership agreement (just something we downloaded and signed) until we decided to incorporate. Four years into our partnership I was drowning. I was working my ass off while she was on paid maternity leave and working remotely from another state \n\nEventually she moved back to my state and we hired three employees. Suddenly she said we didn‚Äôt have enough to pay ourselves and the employees. How? We had dozens of clients and were really humming. So we skipped paying ourselves. But, while her husband had a job, I was a single mom of two. So every time we had to skip paying ourselves I choked harder\n\nEventually I needed to find a job or I‚Äôd lose my house. My partner was livid when I told her I was leaving. When we met with our attorney I learned that we were $30k in debt (this was 2007). So instead of getting paid for half the value of the business, I OWED the business my half of that debt to buy myself out. I was a single mom who hadn‚Äôt even made my full $24k salary that year (yes, that was low back then too)\n\nTurns out we‚Äôd been taking down payments and advance billing our clients but not paying our vendors. We had a huge leased office and lots of business loans. I take 100% responsibility for not paying attention to my business financials. I started a business with no business experience and I made some big mistakes and learned a hard lesson. I should have consulted a lawyer before starting the business, but I was afraid of the expense. I should have had a real partnership agreement from day one. I should‚Äôve been more aware of the financial status of my company.\n\nUltimately, I took out a personal loan for $15,000 which I paid off within two years and subsequently ended up debt free a few years later. I don‚Äôt know what happened to her or the business and I eventually changed career paths\n\nI recommend you familiarize yourself as much as possible with everything about your business as quickly as you can. If your partner resists or doesn‚Äôt want you to see information that is a red flag, trust me. You need to review your partnership agreement and understand what legal options you have. If you have an operating agreement and your partner is in defiance of it then you need to consider legal options. this will be uncomfortable, but you don‚Äôt have to get angry or rude. Keep it cool and do your best to be respectful of your friend, even if he isn‚Äôt respecting you. Keep your head up a new what you can to get through this. Good luck!",

I‚Äôve talked to a few small business owners through my MBA who went into business with close friends, and almost everyone said the hardest part wasn‚Äôt the business itself, but the partnership dynamics.\n\nIt sounds like you‚Äôre right to be concerned. What‚Äôs happening here isn‚Äôt about trust, it‚Äôs about transparency and protecting both of you. The best operators I‚Äôve met handle this by putting SYSTEMS in place that make accountability automatic, so it doesn‚Äôt feel personal. For example, agree that any purchase above a certain amount (say $500) requires a quick written check-in even just a Slack or WhatsApp message before pulling the trigger. Make reimbursements contingent on documented receipts, like uploading a quick photo to a shared Google Drive folder. And if you can swing it, bring in a part-time bookkeeper or use accounting software like QuickBooks that both of you can access; having a third party involved takes the emotion out of it and adds structure.  \n  \nI know it‚Äôs tricky because you‚Äôve got years of friendship layered into this, but a lot of founders say the moment they treated the partnership like a board relationship, things got healthier.\n\nYou‚Äôre not being controlling; you‚Äôre acting like an owner.

It ist he service I provide. I deliver the equipment and am very quick to respond to any issues or problems. What stinks when it comes to companies like this fortune 500 customer is that if my contact retires the newer people aren't always as loyal but it is what it is\n\n  \nand I'm sure you provide the kind of value customers want by being responsive to any issues or questions they have. YOu can't always be the cheapest and be the beast",

      "selftext": "I have recently started my own small business. I thought it would make me financially independent, as I cannot work in a normal job like everyone else because of my Bipolar Disorder. But the moment I started my business, I began facing many issues.\n\nThe first issue was trusting vendors I met online. I foolishly got scammed by fake vendors who sent me realistic invoices, but the products never arrived. This drained my savings and made my family lose trust in me. So instead of taking a big loan and a big risk, I decided to start a small business with a small loan‚Äîwithout realizing that there would be many gatekeepers, hidden costs, and the challenge of operating without working capital.\n\nI finally found an honest vendor who provided me with my goods, but our definitions of ‚Äúgood quality‚Äù were very different due to social status. I wanted to sell to middle and upper-middle-class people, but he thought the same quality applies for all. In India, there is also so much paperwork, and I got scammed by those who handle documentation. I was overcharged by those who made my labels.\n\nI am the first person in generations of my family and caste to ever start a business, so we had no inside knowledge. My own friends who come from business castes acted as gatekeepers‚Äîbecause that‚Äôs what they are taught. I tried to find distributors for my product, but most of them first take the product and then pay only if it‚Äôs sold. This meant I would have to blindly trust them, because even with proper documentation, no legal authorities would care or intervene if they cheated. They know that, and they take advantage of it.\n\nNow, I have a lot of products and no way to sell them. Social media marketing attracted a few friends and supporters to buy, but then the Postal Department refused to send my product because it‚Äôs food. I had to rely on private couriers, which cut all my margins. Nobody reveals where to buy cheap packaging, how to deliver packages at low cost, or how to find honest distributors.\n\nIn India, I think society is designed to keep new entrants out of business and to preserve business opportunities only for certain communities, while keeping the rest of society enslaved to corporates‚Äîso they continue buying from these same communities when it comes to small-scale businesses.",

What you described, gatekeeping, opaque systems, unreliable partners, can make entrepreneurship feel way lonelier than people expect.\n\nOne of my professors likes to say that running a small business is ‚Äúan endurance game of controlled chaos,‚Äù and that really stuck with me. You‚Äôve already shown a lot of resilience by adapting. Those scars are actually the foundation most real entrepreneurs build on, it‚Äôs just that people rarely talk about them publicly.\n\nIf you‚Äôre still up for it, one thing that might help is connecting with local small business networks or accelerators, not the flashy startup ones, but those that focus on local trade or regional entrepreneurs. Even informal WhatsApp or Facebook groups can be gold for getting tips on packaging, logistics, or honest vendors. A few classmates doing ventures in emerging markets leaned heavily on those kinds of micro-communities; they‚Äôre messy but real.\n\nYou‚Äôre right that the system isn‚Äôt designed to make it easy, but the persistence you‚Äôve already shown puts you ahead of most people who stop at the first setback. I hope you don‚Äôt lose that spark even if you pause for a while. This experience will 100% shape how you think about business (and people) going forward.",

Will there be delays due to holidays? Flaky middle sellers? Rising in shipping costs? Drop in market demand? Competitors pricing you out? What can you tolerate? How low can you go? How much time and effort and money will all this cost? Can you do it alone? If you have to hire someone how does that complicate your business and life in terms of time, effort, money, profit, trust, taxes, and laws? All this is investigated and lightedly tested before even considering dropping the 9-5 job. \n\n2.

They don't care if it's scam engagement. They're literally profiting from my ad spend while scammers get free real estate\n\nI calculated last month's damage:\n\n* 47 legitimate customer questions buried under spam\n* 12 people who commented \"how do I buy?\" that we missed for 8+ hours\n* Estimated $2,100 in lost sales from unanswered questions\n\nthe most insulting part? When I report obvious scam comments, FB says \"this doesn't violate community standards.\" Of course not - scam comments INCREASE their engagement metrics!\n\nQuestion for other business mates: At what point do we start treating fb ads as hosting costs for scammer content rather than customer acquisition? how much are u losing to this digital graffiti on ur paid ads?\n\n",

It's been a good run, but after all these years I'm trying to figure out if now is the right time and what kind of valuation I should realistically expect.\n\nThe site is monetized through advertising, primarily Google AdSense (around 55%), though I've diversified over the years with other ad networks and direct sponsors. All traffic is organic (SEO-driven), and I run a very lean operation.\n\nLast 12 months the business did about $1.3M in revenue with roughly $1.16M in profit (around 90% margins).\n\nHere's where I'm struggling: I've heard wildly different numbers on multiples. Some say sites like this trade at 3x SDE/EBITDA (especially from competitors), while others mention 5-6x or even higher for strategic buyers who see specific synergies.\n\nFor those of you who've recently sold similar businesses, what kind of multiple did you actually get? And what should I be realistically targeting here?\n\nAny guidance would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

          "body": "To value a business you look at the past several year's average free cash flow (how much money truly available to spend, so not profit) and then divide that by the relative risk of the business (20% for a super super low risk business, 40%+ for a high risk business). That's basically it, the hard part is determining appropriate free cash flow and risk. You can subtract the expected continued growth rate from risk if you'd expect it to keep growing. \n\nYou say 1.1 in profit, are there any costs not included in that? Does that include your salary (fair market to replace you?). Let's say it's actually $900k in free cash flow this year, but an average of $800k over the last 3 years. So let's say your business grows ~10% every year and can reasonably expect that to continue. \n\nIt's a website, that has inherent risk as it's very low barrier to entry for competitors. How vital are you to the success so far? Losing you would be risky. If I had to guess, id think an investor would determine maybe a 35% risk rating. \n\nTherefore the value in this example is: $800k/(0.35-0.1) = $3.2M. You can play with those numbers as you want, but you'll have to convince an investor why they are different. Hopefully this semi helps you understand how to value your/any business.",

What I have learned after being in business for close  to 35 years is that there is a segment of the population that operates from a position of how they can get one over on the business....they go into the transaction with that in mind....they are looking for a discount, a freebie, an argument to justify refusing to pay, etc. They set this up to hold you essentially hostage. You should always be in the position of control and authority. \n\nCan I ask what type of work (or product, item) you do? When customers start that type of behavior I refuse to give them their item/work until it is paid in full. I also require all of them to pay a 50% deposit upfront. I have had to contact the police to remove irate customers, I have thrown customers out of the shop that are out of line, and I have played hard ball when necessary (suggesting involving the court). Their inability to conduct themselves properly, read documents thoroughly, ask questions and so on is not our problem but, in theory, becomes our problem. If it starts difficult, it will end difficult. I want to earn money but I will refuse to chase down or deal with the difficult customers as it never ends well. A mentor always told me \"not all money is good money.\" Even if you perform to standard and deliver, it still ends with them bad mouthing your business. \n\nYou need to learn to stand your ground. Be a professional but be firm. Are you rushing to correct this order and doing it for free? Did they bully you into that....I want it fixed and I want it tomorrow? Did you charge them for the rush job and the additional requests?",
