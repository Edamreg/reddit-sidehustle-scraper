      "selftext": "I bought a Chevrolet Colorado in July of last year with the intention of starting a side hustle. I considered doing landscaping, hauling junk, or even buying a vending machine. However, while browsing Facebook Marketplace, I came across a listing for a used throne chair. I decided to research how much these chairs typically rent for in other areas and what I could potentially charge if I bought one. Keep in mind, I had no prior experience in the party or event business.\n\nDespite that, I decided to take a chance, bought the chair, and posted it for rent. The post received a lot of views, but no bookings at first. Most businesses in my area charge around $150 to rent a throne chair, plus a delivery fee, which usually brings the total to $180–$200. Since I wasn’t getting much interest, I decided to lower my price from $150 to $120, which also includes delivery within 30 minutes of where I live.\n\nAfter about 3.5 weeks and spending roughly $760, I honestly started to think buying the throne chair had been a bad idea. However, just a couple of days after lowering the price, I received my first booking—then my second, third, and so on. As bookings picked up, I eventually purchased a second throne chair for about the same price, except this one was brand new.\n\nFrom the end of August through the end of December, I made a little over $1,500. While most of that money went toward paying off the chairs, it became clear that there is a lot of potential in this type of business. Along the way, I’ve connected with people from schools, event coordinators, venue owners, and other local businesses.\n\nMy goal for this year is to make over $4,000. While that may not sound like a lot, it’s relatively easy money. The hardest part of the job is loading the chairs onto the truck and properly taking care of them. I make sure to clean them after every event and use bubble wrap on the corners and other important areas that could be easily damaged. I also purchased a tarp and stretch wrap to protect the chairs from dirt during delivery or while they’re waiting for the next booking.\n\nMy next goal is to add a bench throne and a 360 photo booth to the business. We’ll see what the future holds.",

          "body": "If you already work in data or analytics, there are a few side incomes that tend to be realistic and actually leverage that skillset instead of starting from zero.\n\nA lot of people do analytics consulting for small businesses. Things like setting up GA4 properly, cleaning up dashboards, or explaining where traffic or conversions are leaking. Small ecommerce brands especially struggle with this and will pay for clarity.\n\nAnother angle is freelance reporting or dashboard builds. Many founders don’t want complex models, they just want a simple weekly or monthly view that answers “what’s working and what isn’t.” That’s a fast win if you know SQL, Looker, Power BI, or Tableau.\n\nSome go the data audit or tracking setup route. Reviewing event tracking, pixels, attribution, and fixing broken data. It’s boring work for founders but high value.\n\nLonger term, people turn their experience into templates, tools, or micro products like dashboards, attribution spreadsheets, or cohort analysis templates and sell those repeatedly instead of trading time.\n\nThe common thread is that the money usually comes from translating data into decisions, not just running numbers. Businesses pay when analytics directly help them make or save money.",

I've been looking around and seen quite a few ideas and I'm mostly looking for something I can do online besides some nearby work like door dash etc.   \nSo I'm pretty shy overall as a person but I saw there's lots of different options I simply don't know exactly what to do or how? I saw that there was something like shopify and been trying that sort of but it's really confusing even with designs etc and even then I wouldn't be sure how to make use of it although its kind of set up haha. There's selling digital designs and again that's confusing.. I'm pretty shy and not too creative or artistic. I know there's feet finder and as a guy I don't really know if there's a market?   \nI just more so wanted some general help with a direction or advice or.. well, whatever you guys got!  \nthanks for sticking to the end and I'd appreciate any genuine ideas or advice, have a good one :)",

I'd of course like to get into more skilled work, where I'll be able to make more in short bouts.\n\nUnfortunately, I realistically can’t take a job/apprenticeship right now to learn a trade, and I don’t have the capital to buy specialized equipment and hope it pays off. I’m a student with a car and can invest under $1,000.\n\nSo what I'm wondering is do any of you have any ideas, or similar stories? I know sometimes it's just worth it to bite off more than you can chew and learn as you go along.\n\nI'm thinking things like drywall repair, TV mounting, painting. All of which I have no experience with whatsoever. There is also things like house cleaning on the list, which I of course have some experience with, but maybe not enough to charge much for it.\n\nAnd as a P.S, I am okay with some ideas that might be well over $1,000. I do want to start things long into the future too, but would prefer some more accessible ideas so I can at least get closer to that capital.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nHope 2026 has started well for you.\n\nI’m currently building DIFM (Do It For Me), a London-first managed home services platform. The product build is already underway with a CTO, and I’m now narrowing in on a number of strong candidates for a GTM / Ops co-founder role.\n\nI’ve spent the last 15 years working hands-on in property maintenance and residential environments in London. I’m building DIFM because this category is massive but structurally broken. Pricing is unclear, fulfilment is unreliable, and customers are left in the dark when something goes wrong. Most platforms fail not because of demand, but because the operating model collapses once real jobs start happening.\n\nWe’re now close to MVP and entering that pre-launch phase where a lot of important but unglamorous work needs doing. This is the kind of work that gives you a real understanding of how startups are actually built. Not theory, not courses, not buzzwords, but real execution and decision-making under constraints.\n\nI’m looking for one switched-on person who wants to work closely with me during this phase.\n\nTo be clear on expectations from the start: this is not a formal job posting and not a corporate role. The commitment is light, flexible, and fully async, designed around existing commitments. It is initially unpaid as we’re pre-revenue and bootstrapped. If it becomes genuinely valuable on both sides, there’s room to formalise things later, either as a paid role once revenue or funding exists, or through equity only if someone ends up taking real, ongoing ownership.\n\nI’m deliberately not listing a rigid set of tasks. Different people bring different strengths. Some are strong at research, some at outreach, some at organisation, some at spotting problems early. I’d rather understand what you’re capable of than force a title on it.\n\nThis probably isn’t a fit if you’re looking for something polished, guaranteed, or highly structured. It is a fit if you’re curious how real businesses are built from the inside and want exposure to actual decisions while something real is going live.\n\nIf this resonates, send me a short intro, what you’re currently doing, what you’re good at or interested in working on, and a LinkedIn profile or CV.\n\nNo formal process, just a straightforward conversation.\n\nRegardless of whether this is for you or not, wishing everyone a great year ahead!\n\nEddie",

      "selftext": "Four months ago I saw those accounts reading AITA stories getting millions of views. I was like fuck it I'll try.\n\nFirst 10 videos were complete trash. Just my voice over text on screen. Maybe 300 views each. I was ready to delete the whole account.\n\nThen I noticed something. The accounts that were actually blowing up all had a person on screen. Not a real person, like some AI thing. I figured maybe that's what I was missing.\n\nStarted using ElevenLabs for voice cause I sound terrible on recordings. For the avatar I use APOB, edit everything in CapCut. Took forever to figure out but got something that works.\n\nFirst video with an actual face on screen got 4,800 views. I almost shit myself. Next one got 8,000. Then one randomly blew up to 35k and I thought I figured it out.\n\nI didn't figure it out.\n\nIt's been a couple months since then and I still have no idea what makes a video work. Some get 5k views. Some get 60k. One hit 240k and I tried to recreate it like 10 times. Nothing. The algorithm makes no sense.\n\nRight now I'm at:\n\n\\- 2-3 videos a day (used to do 4 but I was losing my mind)\n\n\\- 25k to 40k views per video on average but it's all over the place\n\n\\- 30-40 minutes per video, finding stories takes the longest\n\n\\- Making around $700/month total between TikTok and brand deals\n\nThe process is pretty simple. Find a story on Reddit, usually AITA cause those perform the best. Relationship advice is hit or miss. Edit it down cause people's attention span is like 5 seconds. Generate the voice, make the avatar talk, edit in CapCut, add subtitles cause nobody watches with sound apparently, post around 7pm.\n\nCosts:\n\nAPOB: $14/month\n\nElevenLabs: $22/month\n\nCapCut Pro: $10/month\n\nTotal: $46/month\n\nNot bad but it adds up.\n\nMost of my income comes from brand deals honestly. TikTok payments are inconsistent as hell. Some months it's $200, some months $400. Brand deals are more reliable, usually $300-400/month.\n\nHere's where I'm stuck.\n\nOne, I'm running out of good stories. I've gone through every top post on AITA from the last year. Now I'm scraping through random subreddits and most of it's garbage. Where do you even find good stories at this point? I tried confession and tifu but they don't hit the same.\n\nTwo, my views have been dropping for like 3 weeks straight. I don't know if TikTok changed something or people are just tired of this content. Some days I post 3 videos and they all die under 10k. It's frustrating as hell.\n\nThree, last week someone commented \"isn't this just stealing people's stories\" and now I can't stop thinking about it. I put credit in the description but I honestly don't know if that's enough. I've seen some accounts get taken down. Is this even legal? Like technically it's public content but I'm making money off it so I don't know.\n\nFour, the avatar looks weird sometimes. Especially the hands. I've had people call it out in comments. I don't know if I should try to fix it or just ignore it cause most people don't seem to care.\n\nOne video I did about this wedding drama where the bride uninvited her sister got 240k views. People were in the comments arguing for DAYS about who was wrong. That's when I realized controversy is everything. But I can't predict what's gonna be controversial.\n\nMy girlfriend thinks this whole thing is dumb but she can't argue with the extra $700 lmao.\n\nI want to keep doing this cause the money helps but I feel like I'm one algorithm change away from this whole thing disappearing.\n\nHas anyone else done something like this? How do you deal with views randomly dropping?\n\nAlso where do you find content when you've burned through the obvious stuff?\n\nAnd does anyone actually know the legal situation with using Reddit posts? I keep seeing different answers.\n\nI'm probably overthinking all of this but yeah. That's where I'm at.",

To your point that you give credit; there is no way for the writer of a reddit post to actually gain anything but upvotes (from the 1 out of 20 people who will actually look into that user) by simply tagging their username.  I'd have found it more insulting than anything tbh when my content was stolen if the creator actually admitted 'Yeah this random reddit user put in the work, but I am looking to make cash from it.'  \n\nWhy don't you try specific TV show subs, or r/fantheories and such?  \n\n&gt;TL;DR:    \n*Ppl love learning deep lore, or coherent theories on shows that they like.  I myself have watched many game of thrones videos which go into the finer points (which is why I should have realized I could have made money off of my content to begin with).  This may be an avenue which you could try, though it may be saturated already with all the low hanging fruit already harvested.*  \n\nI wrote a long post about a Dexter theory on there a few years back, spent hours reviewing episodes for relevant quotes and everything.  It got a lot of attention with almost a thousand upvotes, and sat at a 99% upvote ratio.  I only did it to kill time and do something I like to do; write long posts for ppl to engage with.  \n\nIt came to my attention after that someone had taken some of those clips from the show, and basically narrated the video verbatim from my post.  My post was clearly the inspiration for the video, and they used huge chunks of my writing in their narration.  This video was at like over a million views by the time I saw it.  I felt robbed and used.  \n\nGranted, if I were smarter, I guess I should have just made the video myself to begin with.  I wasn't thinking about money though, just providing interesting content on reddit.  To this day I am resentful that some asshole basically took my content and made money off of it; what kinda pisses me off more though is how low effort that was.  (Yes, editing a video takes skill and time, but once the actual creative thinking part is done for you it's not hard to turn it into \"revenue\".  \n\nI spent a lot of effort to make that post, expecting nothing in return except maybe some agreement/discussion of my theory.  This guy, just copy pasted my shit, cut some clips up and turned my efforts into his money in probably less time than I used editing the grammar through drafts of my post.  It feels shitty to be on that end.  Though again, it's my fault for not having the foresight to know it'd be stolen, and not trying and monetize my efforts to begin with I suppose.  \n\nAfter I watched the video, I started getting a ton of recommendations for similar videos which present theories on TV lore, most of which had millions of views.  So if you are going to do this, I suppose that's an angle to try to pursue as well; though it's already saturated.  To avoid repeating other videos; maybe start digging into the lore of newer TV shows rather than ones that have been speculated on for a decade already.  \n\n&gt;*You seem to be mindful of the \"stealing\" aspect of all this, so I am simply giving you a point of view from someone who has been stolen from in this way.  At the end of the day, again I should have known it would happen regardless and either have done the video myself or not even bothered to post the thread.  I can't really be mad that someone saw a chance I did not to make money from something I put out for free, but yet I am resentful.*",

      "selftext": "so this wasnt planned at all but figured id share since it might give someone ideas. I got into drones about 2 years ago just for fun, mostly filming my weekend hikes and local spots around Portland. Posted some clips on instagram and this small real estate agency hit me up asking if they could use one of my neighborhood shots for a listing. I said sure and charged them like $50 thinking that was fair\n\nfast forward and now i have 6 local businesses (3 realtors, a wedding venue, and 2 small hotels) that have me on retainer for $150-300/month each. Theyre basically paying for access to my footage library that i keep updating. I spend maybe 4-5 hours a month flying around getting new stuff and the rest is just them downloading whatever they need from the shared drive I set up\n\nthe best part is i was gonna do this hobby anyway. I had some money saved up from Stakе for a better drone and just reinvested the first payments into upgrading my equipment instead. now its covering itself plus giving me around $1200-1400 extra monthly without much effort",

      "selftext": "First of all, I’m not in the US so pardon my grammar. Basically, I have a less than a year old youtube channel that's letting me enjoy a leisure life and travel around the world. Let me share how I did it for those who are in need of passive income too (like I was before). I will try to give abundant options of the tools as much as I can\n\nFor clarification, this isn't the usual guided meditation channel. The voiceover style is like one but the video is more like national geographic style, I talk about animals and connect it to the human experience in a meditative soothing style (You’ll learn why)\n\nGenerate your script using AI: Gemini/Chatgpt/Claude -  I am using these 3\n\nIt should be 1500-2000+ words so that it reaches more than 8 mins when narrated so you can place more ads\n\nAlso tell the ai that you want scene by scene direction of the script in a national geographic style \n\nCreate the voiceover. \n\nWhat I did was hire someone in Fiverr for $10 per voiceover. I have a long-term vo artist i found there whom I can tip often now because of my channel’s growth\n\nGo to fiverr and search “meditation voiceover” or something and find the cheapest with good reviews. TIP: YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE  EXPENSIVE ARTIST, the difference is negligible imo.\n\nYou can also try Elevenlabs but I found the first one cheaper because ai cannot do humanly breathing yet and it costs so much tokens just to get the tempo and feel I want + stress haha\n\nVideo direction is a must for monetization. Most meditation channels aren't monetized because they just use static images and no storytelling. I use Flow 4k or even the basic version to generate the animal clips. Any ai video generator is fine. I’ve also tried Haylo Labs before\n\nThen Capcut or cracked Adobe premiere for the editing (anything is fine) I don't recommend hiring someone since all you just need to do is drag the generated clips then add the voiceover. But if you really dont want the hassle you can also just hire $5 editing service in Fiverr\n\nVery important: Just make sure the video is 8 mins long or more\n\nDont stress on branding or anything, my channel didn't even have a banner until this year\n\nMy main audience is from the US on the older age side so rpm is above decent\n\n$1,000-$3,000 a month is already huge in my country so I’m happy about my progress. \n\nFeel free to drop your questions below",

So I would never suggest Etsy. It's also fickle, so I'd be in trouble if I depended on that alone. I have a 9-5 that is dependable. \n\nMy point is an actual job is going to make you income to support yourself while you find a side hustle to begin. Most side hustles are on the side because they don't give real pay the rent/mortgage type money. And all of them take a bit of time to develop.\n\nMy 'side hustles' that are fairly passive are things like Fetch Rewards and Evidation where you get points to exchange for gift cards. It isn't quick or steady money. \n\nThat's the biggest trouble with side hustles or working in ecommerce, you never know how much you will earn at any given time. It depends on trends, economy, how you present yourself/product, and how big of a social media following you can gain. \n\nI only mention all this because if you need the money to pay your bills, this isn't something to start now.",

One thing I’d suggest is focusing on skills or systems that don’t trade time for money forever. \n\nI’d look at options that aren’t tied to hourly work long term. Affiliate marketing is one, no inventory, low startup, but it does take learning and patience. Pinterest works especially well because content can drive traffic for months instead of days.\n\nDigital products are another good route if you have any knowledge or experience you can package into templates, guides, or simple resources. You create it once and sell it repeatedly.\n\nIf income is urgent, pairing something faster (freelance, VA work, local services) with a longer-term online strategy can take pressure off! \n\nWhatever you choose, I’d avoid anything promising “quick passive income.” The legit stuff usually takes effort upfront, but it does compound over time.\nAlways open to chat more!",

It’s pretty easy to outsource to other people over time, and it’s less physically demanding than other forms of care work.\n\nAnother example would be party rentals. I saw a post on Reddit today (not sure which sub fortunately) of someone who rents out a large, ‘throne’ style chair for photo shoots at birthdays and baby showers.\n\nIt’s bulky and expensive enough to deter people from buying their own, and the OP was able to undercut their local competitors (ie lower rental and free delivery within a certain area). \n\nAlternatively I would try to leverage a niche skill that has local demand. I have a family friend who rents out enormous cooking pots to members of his community to cater weddings and celebrations. Commercial rental companies don’t stock the style of pots needed by his community, and they can’t guarantee that their equipment has only been used to prepare specific types of food. He runs the business out of his garage and it’s about as close to passive as you can get (ie customers pick up and drop off, pay online).",

You can also make Canva Templates using photo pea but photo shop would be better!",

Game changer was looking at what people searched for on Etsy and Pinterest.\n\nWhat worked:\n\nBundles sell way better than single products. A $27 bundle moves faster than a $7 template even though they take the same time to make.\n\nEtsy SEO isn’t optional. Boring but necessary if you want to be found.\n\nQuality over quantity. 10 good products beat 50 mediocre ones.\n\nWhat didn’t work:\n\nPinterest ads (wasted $200), daily Instagram posting (low conversions), lowering prices (attracts problem customers).\n\nNovember breakdown: $1,840 Etsy, $780 Gumroad, $420 Creative Market.\n\nStill takes about 10 hours a week for customer service and new uploads. Not truly passive but beats a 9-5.\n\n​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

I’m aware of Gumroad, but from a consumer standpoint, do everyday people who purchase digital goods actually go to Gumroad directly? Are they aware of the site and what it’s for?\n\nFrom a creator’s point of view, when I think of Gumroad, I think of it like other platforms where sellers list products, similar to Etsy. But I’m trying to look at it from a user’s perspective. Do people actually go to Gumroad and search for things, or is it mostly your job as the creator to bring in the traffic?\n\nI’m not saying this to be lazy I’m just genuinely curious. If you’re not actively driving traffic, do people actually browse Gumroad from time to time on their own?",

You can outsource editing, script writing, thumbnails, and even channel posting and management. This means you just need to show up and film sometimes, which is pretty decent in terms of working hours I would say.\n\nIt's such a grind at the start, but it's also fun :) happy to answer any questions if you have any also!",

There are definitely some glaring issues, but I'll continue bug fixing as I go along.\n\nOne interesting thing I noticed is that the bot actually takes less trades &amp; i think its due to the lack of that human element. The bot doesn't get those \"gut feelings\" it sticks strictly to its data &amp; parameters. This isn't a bad thing, but there were a few instances the bot ignored while adhering to parameters, that I would have jumped at.\n\nI'm not sure I can code \"emotion\" on the bot &amp; I think doing so may ruin its edge. This is all ramble anyway as I don't have nearly enough data to make a conclusion. Maybe I'll do another update in 3 months to determine idk.\n\nOn my last post there were some of you who asked how I built it, mine is custom coded, but I did say I'll try to find a no code alternative for you guys.\n\nI did find one &amp; took the liberty to try to build out as much of the workflow as I could. Before I dive into it let me just say that if you really want to make custom workflows, learn to code. It was actually harder ( for me ) to build this cause these no code editors have quite a few constraints you don't get coding.\n\n[Regardless here is the workflow](https://www.gumloop.com/pipeline?workbook_id=fn8cXAevPdxcJLPoMyuTfy). I forgot to add a trigger, but in my defense the entire thing was pissing me off so i could focus. ( don't bully me please )\n\nDO NOT under any circumstance use the stupid Ai chat builder thing, i think gummie is the name. It will break the entire workflow. You are better off experimenting &amp; trying different things yourself. Also I'm sharing this workflow as I'm sure one of y'all can improve it &amp; make it infinitely better than I can.  \n  \nHopefully I've covered everything, if not, if I make an update to the update then I'll cover anything I may have left out. As usual feel free to ask any questions. ",

I have an Associates of Arts degree and hoping it will help me land a side job for extra income.  However, the job will have to be online.  Even though I do have an AA degree I am also learning disabled and have an audio processing disorder.  Are there any simple side gigs jobs I can do daily online for extra income?  Looking to make at least $1200 a month to pay for my meds. I did hear about one Data site so I signed up for it, but I am told it can take months to ever hear back if I passed the beginners test.  I really need the help.  Anything you can tell me I will be super thankful for. ",

That’s not how it works.\n\nAffiliate marketing is simple:\n\nYou recommend something. Someone buys. You earn a commission.\n\nThe hard part? Getting the right people to see it.\n\nMost beginners fail because they focus on links instead of learning how to attract attention, explain value, and build trust. Random links in random places don’t convert.\n\nYou don’t need a big following or fancy tools. You do need consistency, patience, and a willingness to learn what actually works.\n\nIt’s remote-friendly, beginner-friendly, and legit, but it’s not passive in the beginning. Think effort first, results later.\n\nTreat it like a real skill, not a shortcut, and it can work.\n\nHope this helps someone avoid wasting time.",

          "body": "This is a really honest question, and it’s good you’re asking it *now* instead of blindly copying whatever’s trending.\n\nI’ll be straight with you, but gently. Most people talking about “digital products + affiliate income” online are either very early, very lucky, or leaving out a lot of context. Consistent income does exist, but it’s usually way smaller and slower at the beginning than TikTok or Twitter makes it look. Think months of nothing, then maybe a few hundred, then gradual growth if you don’t quit.\n\nWhere people get stuck is starting with *vibes* instead of value. “Personal growth, life, mindset” sounds nice, but it’s incredibly hard to monetize unless you already have lived experience people trust or a very specific angle. At 20, that doesn’t mean you can’t do it, but it does mean you’ll need patience and humility. Most people don’t follow accounts for motivation, they follow because something consistently helps them think or act differently.\n\nA better way to think about starting is: who do I want to help, and with what very specific problem? Content works best when it’s tied to something practical, even if it’s small. Studying better, learning a skill faster, navigating early career mistakes, building discipline, saving money, learning a tool. Clarity beats inspiration every time.\n\nMonetization usually comes later and more indirectly than people admit. Affiliates work when you’re already using and recommending tools naturally. Digital products work when you’ve solved a problem enough times that packaging the solution makes sense. Most people don’t “decide” to monetize — it happens because people start asking for more.\n\nAt your age, the biggest win isn’t quick side income, it’s building skills and credibility in public. Content can be part of that, but it shouldn’t be the whole plan. Learn something real, document the process honestly, help others who are one or two steps behind you. That compounds way better than chasing funnels and links.\n\nIf you start with curiosity, consistency, and actually being useful, money becomes a byproduct. If you start with money as the main goal, burnout usually shows up first. You’re early. That’s an advantage, not a disadvantage.",

          "body": "I didn’t start with content creation or personal growth. I started with high intent audiences. In the UK I noticed soccer tipsters running £10 to £1,000 challenges and daily picks on Facebook and Twitter. Every post had hundreds of people emotionally invested in the next bet. These people already had bookmaker accounts and were actively trying to make money.\n\nInstead of competing with tipsters, I targeted their audience. I explained, using basic maths, why long term tipping is mathematically impossible for most people. I shared expected value, variance, and why chasing picks fails. I also drip fed examples of value betting where odds were longer than the implied probability, which built credibility fast.\n\nOnce people trusted the logic, I introduced matched betting as a risk free way to convert bookmaker bonuses into cash. Because the audience was already high intent, conversions were strong. Even after 9 years, my conversion rate has never dropped below 20%.\n\nA few years later I immigrated to the east coast of the US. By then I had long standing affiliate relationships with UK brands, and when those operators launched in the US , the partnerships carried over. The same model worked even better in the US because incentives were larger and the concept was brand new to the market, only available since 2018. \n\nToday it’s essentially passive. The content runs itself, the funnels are mature, and I don’t actively sell. I even have a QR code magnet on my truck that links to a simple explainer with my affiliate tracking embedded. It still converts because it meets people at the right moment with the right message.",

      "selftext": "\n\nNot a huge number compared to some posts here, but it’s a personal milestone so I wanted to share what actually worked.\n\nI started about 8 months ago after losing my job. I sell Canva and Notion templates on Etsy, Gumroad and on my website bought via a [portal](https://sitefy.co/product/digital-products-website-to-sell-digital-downloads-online/).\n\nThe first 3 months were rough. I made around $400 total. Biggest mistake was creating things I liked instead of what people were actively searching for. Things changed once I started researching Etsy search terms and Pinterest trends.\n\nWhat worked:\n\n• Bundles sell much better than single products. A $27 bundle moves faster than a $7 template, even though both take similar effort.\n• Etsy SEO is not optional. It’s boring, but it’s the difference between zero views and consistent sales.\n• Quality over quantity. 10 solid products outperform 50 average ones.\n\nWhat didn’t work:\n\n• Pinterest ads. Lost about $200 with almost no return.\n• Daily Instagram posting. Lots of effort, very low conversions.\n• Lowering prices. It didn’t increase volume and just brought more support issues.\n\nNovember breakdown:\n• Etsy: $678\n• Gumroad: 228$\n• Creative Market: $42\n\nI still spend around 10 hours a week on customer support and uploading new products, so it’s not truly passive. But it beats going back to a 9–5.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone’s curious.",

      "selftext": "Quick background: Started a niche site in September 2025 in a moderately competitive space (home office equipment reviews). This is my third site but the first where I'm seriously experimenting with social media as a traffic/authority driver alongside traditional SEO.\n\n\n\nWanted to share what I've learned so far about using social signals to help a new site gain traction faster.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The theory I'm testing:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nGoogle's helpful content update seemed to emphasize \"real\" sites with actual audiences vs pure SEO plays. My hypothesis: if I can build genuine social engagement around my content, it might send positive signals that help with indexing and initial rankings.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What I set up:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Created accounts on IG, TikTok, Pinterest, and YouTube Shorts\n\n\\- Each piece of content I publish gets repurposed into short-form social content\n\n\\- Goal: drive some initial traffic + build \"brand signals\" that Google might pick up\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The problem I ran into:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nStarting from zero followers on every platform meant my content was basically invisible. Even good stuff got like 50 views max. The chicken-and-egg problem is real.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What I tried:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Pure organic grinding\\*\\* (first 6 weeks): Posted consistently, engaged with others, used trending sounds/hashtags. Result: painfully slow. Got to maybe 200 followers across all platforms.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Engagement pods\\*\\* (weeks 7-8): Joined a few Discord groups for mutual engagement. Result: felt fake, took way too much time, and the engagement didn't seem to help reach.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Small paid boosts\\*\\* (weeks 9-12): Used a combination of platform ads and an SMM service (Crescitaly - it's an Italian panel that delivers pretty realistic-looking engagement). I'd give new posts a small push of 100-200 likes/views to help them get initial traction.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Results so far (Month 4):\\*\\*\n\n\n\n| Metric | Month 1 | Month 4 |\n\n|--------|---------|----------|\n\n| Social followers (total) | 200 | 2,400 |\n\n| Monthly social referral traffic | \\~50 | \\~800 |\n\n| Indexed pages | 8 | 34 |\n\n| Organic traffic | 0 | \\~150/day |\n\n| DR (Ahrefs) | 0 | 8 |\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What I think is happening:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nThe social traffic, even though it's small, seems to be sending positive signals. Pages that get social shares tend to get indexed faster. I also noticed a few natural backlinks coming from people who found my content through social.\n\n\n\nThe SMM boosts didn't directly help SEO (obviously), but they helped my social content get seen by real people who then engaged organically. It's like using a small paid push to unlock organic distribution.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What flopped:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Pinterest: Took way more effort than expected for minimal return\n\n\\- Trying to grow all platforms equally: Should have focused on 1-2\n\n\\- Over-boosting: When I tried larger boosts (500+ likes), the engagement looked suspicious and didn't convert to real followers\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Questions for the community:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. Anyone else experimenting with social as part of their niche site strategy? What's working for you?\n\n\n\n2. Do you think Google actually factors in social signals, or am I just getting lucky with timing?\n\n\n\n3. For those further along: did early social investment pay off long-term, or is it just a distraction from content/links?\n\n\n\n4. Is there an ethical line with using paid boosts to kickstart social? I go back and forth on this.\n\n\n\nHappy to share more details if anyone's interested. Still very much learning but wanted to document the journey.",

But the thing that got me was how many other older people in her neighborhood were in the same boat but had no one to help them.\n\nThese weren't your typical \"hire a junk removal service\" situations. These folks needed someone patient who understood that every item has a story and you cant just toss everything. They also needed help deciding what actually has value vs what doesn't, how to sell stuff on facebook marketplace (most of them have no clue), and someone to physically do the heavy lifting.\n\nStarted offering this super specific service in my area. \"Downsizing assistance for seniors\" basically. I help them sort, list valuable items online, coordinate donations, and handle the actual cleanout. Charged $35/hour which felt fair and I had a little money saved up from Stakе so I could test it without stressing about immediate income.\n\nFirst client came from my moms friend. Then word of mouth exploded because apparently every boomer in a 10 mile radius is dealing with this. Now I'm booked 3 weeks out and averaging around $4k/month working maybe 20 hours a week. The crazy part is how many of their kids are willing to pay me to do this because they either live far away or dont have the patience.\n\nIm wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?",

When I sold my Grandma's house in 2016, I went down there for a week and loaded up a trailer with the valuable items or things I thought I'd use at home. The rest of the house was evacuated by a team of some 5 laborers who bagged/boxed up clothes, linens, books, etc and brought them to their warehouse. It took them maybe half a day to tie up loose ends. From there, the business model was simple. Once a month, this business would hold a public auction that went from like 7am till 9pm. Lots of similar items from different estates would be placed in this enormous warehouse/outdoor space and people would come through and make offers on items (or just buy outright for a fixed price). Throughout the day, at different time checkpoints, the price would be reduced by 25% until the last few hours of the day it would be 75% off. At the end of the day, all unsold goods were landfilled or donated. \n\nIn terms of making money, the contract was set up where I owed the company $1,000 no matter what and 25% of net revenue of sold goods. They ended up getting around $3,000 for the miscellanea of her house so I only owed $250 above what they got from the sale. They also set me up with a contractor/realtor to get the house minimally ready for sale.\n\nI'm not saying you need to scale it that large, but that's how that company was able to provide families with some peace of mind that the entire house wasn't just going in the trash.",

You operate in a unique space of being able to come from outside and handle the downsizing/listing of items. For example, if you, a stranger/expert come and tell them that this item should be listed and is worth ~$20, they might accept your word for it while if their son or daughter comes and says the same thing, they might argue and tell them they're wrong. \n\nI deal with the same thing with my family all the time. I did my degree in computer science and economics. I work in tech. My parents are academics (researchers at a uni). They will argue with me till they're blue in the face about systems I've literally worked on because I'll always be their son and kid in their head, but if one of my colleagues said the same thing as me, they'd accept it as expert testimony.\n\n&gt; Im wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?\n\nI mean, it's a specialist version but you have a lot of parallels. You should think about what exactly makes up the core parts of your profession and how it differs from other similar, overlapping industry professions. From there, you can figure out a)where to hire from, b) how to hire, c) what needs to be taught, and d) how you continue to refine that niche. It can totally scale. (and as others have said, $35 an hour is less than what I pay just for regular cleaning ladies to come dust my place every week lol. You also have to keep in mind if you take outside help, your prices need to scale so you make your cut and can also handle other things like equipment, liability, etc.. At least in LA, I pay $50 an hour pp (e.g. $200 for 2 hours with a crew of 2) and that feels fairly standard/not the lowest budget but certainly not high end. So yeah, $35 for specialist help? Not surprised to hear that it's popular).",

Credit card saved for processing and if you bid and won, it was yours.\n\nIf I recall correctly, you had to agree that you could pick up the goods on the specified pickup date during a set of hours. This allowed the company to arrange all pick ups of goods from the house on one single day. They'd only have to worry about what didn't sell.\n\nIf a customer didn't make it to pickup between the set hours on the pickup date, the goods went to second place in the auction for an arranged day, and you were charged anyway.\n\nI think each lot had an easy minimum set, like that Sports Stuff example would start at like $6.\n\nWas pretty awesome.",

But actually sitting down with someone while they go through their things? That’s rare.\n\n\n\nI’ve seen companies try to scale too fast, hiring a ton of people, and that’s when things start slipping. It’s not always about hiring the wrong people. The truth is, you can’t teach real empathy with a checklist. If you want to grow, you’re better off sticking with a small, solid team you trust. Chasing bigger numbers just isn’t worth it if you lose that personal touch.\n\n\n\nHonestly, making $4k/month for twenty hours of work and having more demand than you can take on?

If that bothers you (I know the feel), grandfather in the people who your current clients refer to you after the rate change, or grant those referrals a reduced rate special for the first X hours or something.\n\nScaling something like that is tricky. The reason you're so successful, and distinguishing yourself from what's out there, is your emotional intelligence and empathy. That can be recruited, but not really realistically taught on an employee-training timeline. I wouldn't try to make this a big company with many agents or anything like that.\n\nThat said, with careful consideration and selection, you could probably justify expanding to a very small team, and perhaps dividing up labor would be efficient as well, like having someone to list things for sale, someone else to do hauling with a truck, whatever of that nature comes to mind for you based on your operation. Or each person could just take on the full scope of services, and the team just divides up clients. You have lots of cool options for helping people in your area, hooking up one or two or a few other people with a good job, and making your business easier on yourself. But yeah, I think if you try to expand very far beyond a smallish company in your particular city/region, it would probably succeed, but probably also lose a lot of the real core value being provided (that being the compassionate shepherding of people through a difficult life transition). Only you can decide what your priorities are.",

Eventually I put in up to about \\~70k of my own funds (owners capital) to grow the business. I started with no funding, no mentor, no one in the business and no courses. Lost 2k on my first 2 watches in 2024. Lost another 8k later that year. I mostly sell Rolexes and luxury brands. Nothing under 1k. Average watch price is around 10k.\n\n2024 - First 6 months:\n\n\\- 561k in sales\n\n\\- 22k gross profit\n\n\\- 13k net profit\n\n2025 - One year:\n\n\\- 1.2m in sales\n\n\\- 87k gross profit\n\n\\- 63k net profit\n\n\\- \\~8k payroll (salary to myself)\n\nIve been wholesaling pretty much everything. Fast flips. I aim for 6-12% margins, depending on how long I’m holding a watch. I’ve lost a few times, can count on one hand probably. I’m trying to get to a point where I’m making a consistent 10k / month net, after all expenses including my salary of 1k / month.\n\nI do some social media / marketing but very little. Trying to really focus on that this year so I can sell to more retail clients for a healthier margin. As well as buy more watches from retail clients.\n\nIt’s been really fun and I love watches and enjoy getting to wear them while I try to sell them. I still have my day job and don’t think I’m going to quit anytime soon.\n\nJust wanted to share this. If I missed anything or any questions just ask below. I’m going to try to post regular updates to track my progress and engage with others as I have never done it before. \n\nThanks!",

Faster, clean decisions with imperfect info often beat waiting for the perfect price. I think that’s a big part of why you’re hitting consistent volume now.\n\n\nCurious, do you ever formalize that into a rule?

Nothing flashy, just something I thought could actually turn into a real business if I stayed consistent. I have some money saved up, so I wasn’t risking rent or groceries, which made me feel like I was being “responsible” about it.\n\nWhat I didn’t expect was how much mental energy it would take. Every decision feels heavier than it should. Pricing, timing, whether I should launch now or wait, whether I’m overthinking or underthinking. I’ll make a choice, feel okay about it for a few hours, then start questioning if it was the wrong move.   \nThere are nights where I’m sitting on the couch scrolling on my phone, not even working, but my brain is still stuck on the business. Wondering if I should’ve done something differently that day, or if I’m already messing it up without realizing it. It’s not burnout exactly, more like this constant low-level pressure. The funny part is, when I talk to friends, they think it’s exciting. And it is, sometimes. But a lot of it just feels lonely and uncertain in a way I didn’t really anticipate. There’s no one to tell you “yes, this is correct” or “no, that’s a bad idea.”\n\nFor those of you who’ve been doing this longer, does that part ever get quieter or do you just get better at living with the uncertainty and trusting your own decisions?",

That way, the next day will be an exercise in getting the important stuff done.\n\nAnd don't forget to include some \"timeout\" slots to let your engine cool down.\n\nGoogle \"Pomodoro timer\" and how it helps your brain reach maximum performance without turning into a big pile of discouraging spaghetti.\n\nPlan your work AND work your plan.

          "body": "This part is very real and rarely talked about. The money risk is finite, but the mental load is constant because every decision feels like it could compound in the wrong direction. What seems to change over time is not the doubt disappearing, but your relationship to it. You start recognizing which decisions are reversible and which ones are not, and that alone lightens the pressure. Having some kind of external cadence helps too, like regular reviews or deadlines, so your brain does not spin endlessly. Loneliness is common because responsibility removes the feeling of being validated by default. Most people who stick with it learn to trust their process more than any single choice. The uncertainty never fully goes away, but it does get quieter once you see that most “wrong” decisions are survivable.",

There’s kind of two vectors that converge with entrepreneurial experience:\n\n1. You learn the methods the madness, coping with chaos, making the calls, techniques in intuition and creativity etc. And you get better at managing it all personally. Getting timing right. You learn from failures and learn even more from successes (success is where you get patterns you know work, and can now remix those patterns to the next thing).\n2. You learn how to make the chaos transform into insight and actual information about the product and businesses you are building. You learn things like pretotyping, lean startup, Osterwalder’s 3 fits, MVP, and a wealth of other ways to reduce your risk and accelerate your learning. And maybe most of all you learn that there’s this thing called the customer. Wonderful source of insight and knowledge on what works, what they are willing to pay for and how. Much of chaos goes away when you go to the customer with decisions you would need to make, and get their input on the choices. Or just use design thinking as a strategy: really listen to the customer, empathize with their situation, and learn heavy from it. Learn to ask questions like: “I have a legally binding purchase order here for my product, it’s 75,000$ would you sign it right now?” And when they don’t sign it, asking “what would it need to have to for you to sign it right now?” And then you listen very carefully what follows.\n\nThere’s even a literal science to this. People like Steve Blank / Harvard have cracked a lot of it. Alexander Osterwaldwer / IMD as well. Anyone can learn from these leading educators on how it’s done.",

You operated within a legal framework someone else created.\n\nThe rugged individualism myth erases all the invisible support that enabled your \"solo\" success.\n\nNobody builds anything truly alone. But admitting you had help doesn't fit the narrative entrepreneurs want to sell.\n\nYou had family money for startup capital. You had connections from your expensive university. You had a safety net if things failed. But the story becomes \"I started with nothing\" because acknowledging privilege doesn't inspire people to buy your course.\n\nI was on my laptop last night reading another \"self-made\" success story and every sentence ignored the massive support system that person had. Partner who paid bills during the lean years? Never mentioned. Parents who let them live rent-free? Erased from the story.\n\nThe myth is harmful because it makes people think they're failing when they need help. That asking for support means you're not a real entrepreneur.\n\nSuccess is collective even when one person gets the credit.",

The “I built this alone” narrative often resonates because it simplifies complexity into a story that’s easy to tell. It doesn’t reflect reality. Most successes are built on networks of support, systems, mentors, community infrastructure, and the ecosystem that makes opportunity possible.\n\n\nThat said, there’s also something to be said for the personal agency in execution. Two people can have the same resources, but only one might put in the sweat, iteration, and discipline needed to move an idea forward.\n\n\nI think the record should show both elements: acknowledge the support that made a thing possible AND the individual choices that drove it over the finish line.\n\n\nCurious, for people here who do talk about having built something “alone,” what do you think that phrase is trying to communicate? Is it about resource constraints? Autonomy of decision? Ego? Or something else?",

Did you know that majority of new business have to close down because of health insurance? Having good health insurance as self employed is necessary. \nIf you have a partner that takes care of the household, that is help. If you can afford to outsource, that is no longer self made. \nIf you can work 100 plus hours on your business, your entrepreneurship journey, how do you have time to do anything else?\nHave you tried working on a business while still trying to maintain a part time or full time job and have to take care of a household all on your own? The problem is, everyone tells you, you just have to work all day and night, just focus on your business. \nBut they never tell you the help they had. We are not made to make every decision on our own. I have a great example of a guy I knew that, even though he had a great support system that put him to the peak of his success, everything started crashing down when he stopped using his support system. \nIf you do not have a good support system, having no support system is better than a bad one. \nI’ve learned that trying to manage everything myself, I can’t do it alone. Now I’m learning how to outsource. I wish a “self made” entrepreneur would point this out in very simple words. \nThere is no such thing as self made. You can come up with an idea on your own, but the execution might not be great on your own. And if you want to grow your business, okay you’re saving money by doing it on your own, but time is money.

I built and maintain essentially the entire product, run infrastructure, fix bugs, and handle most customer support. My two co-founders focus on business and sales.\n\nEquity is split 40% / 40% / 20% (me). Originally it was meant to be equal, but it changed at incorporation due to capital contribution issues. I also don’t have sole signature rights.\n\nOver the last months, they:\n\n\\- Excluded me from business meetings\n\n\\- Started discussing decisions privately\n\n\\- Reduced communication\n\n\\- Admitted later they “distanced themselves”\n\nThen they began blaming me for:\n\n\\- Not being involved enough\n\n\\- Not asking about meetings I was excluded from\n\n\\- “Acting like an employee” because I mainly do technical work\n\n\\- Not doing business/sales/networking (which was never my role)\n\nNow one of them gave me an ultimatum:\n\n1. Become an employee and give up founder equity\n2. Leave completely\n\nThey refused my proposal to align expectations or do a measurable performance plan.\n\nThey also said things like:\n\n\\- “We can’t have someone who does nothing and bunkers equity.”\n\n\\- “This is just derisking for us.”\n\n\\- “It’s too late to fix things because there is now distance.”\n\nWe do have a co-founders’ agreement that says:\n\n\\- Equity reflects long-term contribution\n\n\\- Performance issues should go through a written improvement plan with a cure period\n\n\\- Disputes should go through negotiation -&gt; mediation -&gt; arbitration\n\n\\- Vested equity can’t be forced to transfer (5% vested)\n\n\\- Role or equity changes need unanimous consent\n\nThey skipped all of that and went straight to an ultimatum.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\\- Is this a normal “professionalization” move or a co-founder squeeze-out?\n\n\\- Do I actually have leverage here, or will majority control win anyway?\n\n\\- Should I refuse both options and force mediation / legal process?\n\n\\- Is accepting employee status a bad idea long-term?\n\nThanks for any advice.",

It could be beneficial for all, if that's what fits your personalities, competencies, ambitions etc. What was necessary in the beginning may no longer be the best setup now. However, you have built something, and taken risk, and you need to be rewarded for that (in equity or cash) based on what is your current legal right.\n\nI think your priority now should be to balance the following two things:\n\n1. Make use of professional legal services, a lawyer that represents your interests only. They can also have a lawyer. Don't share lawyers. This is a business matter, act as a professional.\n\n2. Keep your relationship and interactions with your co-founders very friendly. It feels like being attacked because that's what it is, but it's a business matter. Keep business and personal worlds separate and remain friends and don't burn bridges.",

Analyzing your situation, you're already in a real bind. The only thing they haven't done that keeps you in the game is your 20%. If I were you, I'd sell that 20% for as much as I could, hire a lawyer, set several demands, demand royalties for the development, and include a clause to be recognized as a titleholder, making it clear that these royalties are non-revocable. I'd make a legal defense clearly stating that you're being wronged because you have no knowledge of the meetings. It's a shame you're in Switzerland. I'd fight this battle with you!",

Even a warm phone call, a personal visit, shared routines become the memories that actually last.  \nChasing success for them is beautiful, but don't turn love into a deadline. if they raise someone this driven and this caring, you have already given them proof they disn't fail.\n\nI was in similar boat a while ago, but my oldman gave this advice, and my wife validated the same, now we are in happy space.",

One of the purest motivations is the desire to repay those who have sacrificed for you.  \nHowever, don't wait until you \"make it\" to spend time with them or express your concern. Success isn't only about the major event; it's also about the small things that happen along the route. Give them a call, stop by when you can, and show them that you're trying.

Offering a discount if you can showcase the work you do with them to other clients as part of your marketing might make it worthwhile.  Obviously, depends on the business.\n\nThat said, if they come in promising to pay more later, that's a pretty big red flag.  I very likely would also walk away.  Even if they could bring you in steady work in the future, they likely will always push to give you minimal margins, so you'll be working a lot for them, but not really profiting.  Again, depends on the type of business if this is worth it or not.",

If they truly valued what you bring and saw the ROI potential, they'd find the budget or wait until they could afford you properly.\n\n\n\n$50k hurts to walk away from but you just saved yourself from potentially months of undervalued work and the resentment that comes with it.

There is no rush or time table on whatever you are working on... Just do what you can when you need the distraction. Don't do anything that will require your time, unless you need the distraction, or are sure you unable to be spending it with your loved one. I will share some of my story. I don't know if it will help or not, as I'm still not sure how it turns out....\n\nI quit my job (6-figures) last February to move 200 miles back to my hometown to take care of my father. He was  having a hard time and seemed to be going through early stages of dementia. My Dad in the 8 months before that lost his brother, his wife (step-mom) and his sister. He was best friends with his brother, extremely close to his sister, and married to his wife for over 40 years. The year before we lost his father and the year before that his mother. The lost seemed to take a piece of my Dad's mind each time. But I was just far enough a way to not see it... I talked to him 4 or 5 times a week but he was always according to him doing good. \nMy Dad and I have always been really close and if you ask him, his whole life he was always good, or fine. By the time I got here I instantly knew he wasn't good. It took a few months to find out he had stage 4 lung cancer, that had traveled to his brain, and bones. My Dad who was never sick, never had a surgery, or illness, and was the rock in my life. He was a good man, that was always smiling, and really cared for everyone he ever met. I only saw him mad a few times in my life, and never sad except when we lost loved ones.\nI dropped everything in my life the day he called me to ask if I had talked to his sister, my aunt.. who we lost 6 months before. I literally quit my job as a Program Manager at a Fortune 100 company, packed a suitcase, and drove the 200 miles to his house. I gave everything else I owned away to family and my wife of 30 years that I had recwbtly seperated from. \n\nI came here and since that day I took him to every appointment and treatment, watched him waste away all the way down to 85 lbs after the radiation treatments, cooked his meals 3 times a day that he just couldn't eat eventually, carried him to the bathroom, bathed him, and held his hand when he took his last breath on December 13th 2025. By then I was struggling to feed myself and keep the lights on. I scrapped up just enough to pay for the funeral. Now I have to be out of his home by February 1st and not sure what I'm going to do... probanly sleep in my car. Idk... \nWhatever happens I'm thankful for the time I had.. I'm haunted by it as well. He was who I talked to whenever anything happened in my life. I sometimes would put off something or whatever it was for days before talking to him, because I knew he would tell me the right thing to do.. and that was usually the hard thing I was avoiding. But that was the kind of person he was. He was good. In the 10 months we probably had 5 or 6 people stop by... He didn't want others to know or worry about him.. ever. But over 100 people showed up at his funeral. Many I didn't know. He was truly a great man, quiet, good looking, funny, talented, humble... and really so talented... as an artist, a musician, and really everything, he could literally do everything. The man was amazing and just so so humble. A professional musician his whole life. He could play any instrument since he was 6 years old. Didnt read music, you could just turn on the radio, hand him any instrument and he would start playing along with whatever was playing. He was a studio musician and recorded for a ton of names everyone would know. He was flawless thats why they hired him when making the final cut of a song or album. He also was a  business owner, and so much more. He was just good and I know I'm blessed to have had him as a father.  Sorry for going on. \nI'm still lost, I don't know how to deal with it or anything anymore. \n\nBut if you take anything away from my ramblings, just be thankful for whatever time you have left. Spend as much time as possible with your loved one. Ask them questions, make them tell you all their stories, experience anything they are still able to do... bring your laptop. There will be plenty of time between those moments to turn your mind to websites and whatever just to distract yourself from the doctor's office, or hospital room, or the nap they are taking. That's all I have. I will pray for you and your family. If you want to talk or need someone just to listen, im available.",

It could be a larger property management company writes you a big check and you walk away immediately or in the very short term.  It could be a private equity leveraged buyout where you get a decent sized check but still own some of the company and work with your new lords and masters toward some bigger multi-year goals and a second payoff down the the road.  It could be a large corporate entity where you get a big check and become a middle manager employee doing essentially the same job you've been doing but now for a salary+bonus structure (contract or at will) under the umbrella of the corporation.\n\nI would start by asking one or more of those who have approached you.  Pick one who is actually in your business, not a broker or middleman type, and just have a chit chat about it.  But certainly don't just dance with one fella.  If you decide to get serious about working a deal, engage experienced help such as brokers and lawyers.  Cast a wide net and find the right deal for you.  I don't like to pay big bucks to brokers and lawyers any more than the next guy, but this is an area where professional help is a must.

      "selftext": "When I started my company, I was naive.\n\nI thought success and money would come fast.  \nSix months. Maybe a year.\n\nI believed that if the idea was good and I worked hard enough, things would line up.  \nThat investors were out there, waiting for founders like me to show up with the right story.\n\nThat belief didn’t come from nowhere.  \nSocial media makes entrepreneurship look fast, obvious, and rewarding, especially if you are willing to sacrifice a bit.\n\nReality was very different.\n\nEarly on, I met an entrepreneur who had been through a divorce.  \nI asked him about his journey and about the divorce.\n\nHe told me something simple:\n\n“Everything has a price.  \nIf you are not willing to pay it, you don’t get the reward.”\n\nAt the time, I understood the words.  \nI didn’t understand the depth.\n\nWhat I know now is that entrepreneurship doesn’t just test your skills.  \nIt tests how much uncertainty you can live with, and for how long, without breaking.\n\nIt’s lonely.  \nNot in a dramatic way.  \nIn a quiet, repetitive way.\n\nThere are very few celebrations.  \nJust an endless stream of decisions, doubts, and problems to solve.  \nEvery day.\n\nYou lose people along the way.\n\nNot because you become arrogant.  \nNot because you “don’t care anymore.”  \nBut because you stop building an acceptable life, one where responsibility is shared, and move toward a life where outcomes fall largely on you.\n\nYou stop drifting.  \nYou take control.  \nAnd once you do, there’s no one left to blame.\n\nThat mindset doesn’t stay at work.\n\nIt changes how you see relationships.  \nTime.  \nCompromise.  \nRisk.\n\nYou start operating with a level of intensity and accountability that not everyone around you wants or can follow.\n\nIn my case, this contributed to my divorce.  \nI couldn’t stay in a relationship that no longer worked for either of us.  \nThat choice came with real loneliness.\n\nI also used to believe entrepreneurship was about eventually sharing success with your family.  \nMore freedom.  \nMore time.  \nMore presence.\n\nWhat I didn’t anticipate is that the transition itself is costly.\n\nYou lose time before you gain any.  \nYou are less present than you’d like.  \nAnd the emotional margin shrinks long before the rewards show up.\n\nThere is something important I wish I had understood earlier.\n\nEntrepreneurship is not just hard.  \nIt is hard in a very specific way.\n\nIf you struggle with prolonged uncertainty,  \nif you need frequent reassurance,  \nif financial stress or ambiguity quickly destabilize you,  \nthis path can slowly erode you.\n\nNot because you are weak.  \nBut because not everyone is wired to operate for long periods without feedback, validation, or safety nets.\n\nAnd that is okay.\n\nThere is no shame in choosing stability.  \nIn preferring predictable income.  \nIn building a life with more emotional space.\n\nEntrepreneurship isn’t better.  \nIt isn’t braver.  \nIt is simply a different set of trade offs, and a very expensive one psychologically.\n\nI am not sharing this to complain or to glorify suffering.  \nI chose this path, and I still do.\n\nBut if you are considering it, be honest with yourself about the price.  \nAnd if you are already on it and feeling this weight,\n\nyou are not broken.\n\nYou are experiencing what this path actually demands.",

When I was in my early thirties, I almost gave up and chose stability. Find a large growing family and my wife wasn't on the same page with my long-term goals, and who I was as a person. After fifteen years it led to our divorce.\n\nAt absolute rock bottom in December 2016 I went out one New Years eve, broken, and ready for the end. I met my now wife that night just before midnight. We spent three and a half days talking. She told me to kick off bottom.She saw who I was deep down.\n\nIt made all the difference in the world. I thought maybe...\n\n2017 I started my business with literally nothing but my skills, knowledge, and enough spark to kick hard off bottom. I'd built companies over and over again that were very successful for the people that i've worked for over the years. I knew what to do, and I had a new energy to do it. I had nothing to lose and I had everything to lose.\n\nLooking back, I did believe within that first year we would break seven figures easily. We had a commercial truck part that had never been manufactured overseas. We chose higher grade materials, and we modified the designs to make installation a fraction of the time. I set the price at 50%-60% less than anyone else in the market. I made a 150-200 cold calls everyday except some Sundays for many many years consistently.\n\nLike you I slowly realized that it was definitely going to be a much longer journey. Those first four years we ate at food banks more than we ate at grocery stores. Well, at least my wife and I did. We let the kids eat the good stuff and they never knew.\n\nThe divorce dragged on for 6 long years. I changed my goal to wanting. Fuck you money so I could get better lawyers, specialists, and private detectives. I lost 2 daughters in that season and a son whom I was eventually able to find and reconnect with. I gained three amazing stepchildren. Lost a few people to covid. Almost lost the home five different times. Eventually, choosing to sell it, and buying an r v to live in. Cut all holidays and birthdays down to homemade gifts. Downsize everything out of our lives. Ran up hundreds of thousands in lawyer debts. \n\nThe struggles were what motivated me to work through it though. I couldn't sleep. I knew my kids were out there somewhere alive. A human is not built to successfully grieve a child that is missing but still alive.\n\nAfter my wife and kids were in bed, I would get out of bed and work until 2-4am at times. Not because I wanted to, but I couldn't sleep. Those days and weeks and months may have been what pushed us through those first four years. \n\nI wouldn't change any of it. We achieved the freedom of time, more control of our lives, touched countless lives with the resources we have built at the fuck you money stage. \n\nIt's not for everyone now.And that's okay. My biggest lesson that i've learned is you have to find bliss in the day to day.No matter what.",

          "body": "Thanks for sharing. You bring out a number of points that I certainly experienced as a two time entrepreneur. Maybe one of the most insightful and honest words about what it takes to be a real entrepreneur. What really hits home is:\n\n“Everything has a price.\nIf you are not willing to pay it, you don’t get the reward.”\n\nI started my first company as a spin off of another company that was sold. I had a partner who was the university-based founder of the first company. Plus, other key people from that company were investors in the spin off. I was CEO for 2 years and stepped back into a CTO role and my partner left the university to come on board as CEO. We raised over $70M, got in the pipeline to do an IPO, then 911 hit and the shit really hit fan. We ended up laying off 80% of our staff (many who were good friends).  We refocused on our core and took a few years to stabilize. We got new investors, my cofounder was pushed out, new management came in and the company was sold for 2-3 years later for $50M. I worked my ass off for 10+ years and only got about $300K out of the sale. I left shortly after, looked for job, couldn’t find one and decided to start a new company again.\n\nI moved with my wife and 12 year old son to a state where I didn’t know anyone. A fresh start. I licensed technology out of the local university and started a new company on my own. I did everything myself for a year and got some part time contractors to help (including key tech workers from the university). I got some early sales and had investors knocking on my door. I was trying to avoid taking any investor money, but I was burning thru my personal savings, so I decided to take on some investment. My goal was to raise as little as possible while getting sales. Ultimately ended of raising about $15M over an 8 years period and sold the company for nearly $100M. As the sole founder I did pretty well. \n\nAlong the way, I experienced many of the personal issues you mentioned. My wife left me because I just didn’t have time for her or my son. This still pains me nearly 20 years later. Eventually we reconciled and are doing well today, but the journey was extremely painful on a personal basis, but hugely rewarding from a business perspective.

Engineering probably has changed the most but here are some use cases that has impressed me personally as the CEO:\n\n1. Writing Code: Like Ryan Dahl said, all of our software engineers have kinda become product managers because almost all actual code is written using AI agents like Windsurfs Cascade! I believe Cursor is pretty good as well but we use Windsurf mostly!\n2. A/B Testing at Scale:  Our team setup an automation flow using N8N that automatically uses Google Nano Banana and Gemini to generate ad variations using our Google ads data! This is then tested and auto improved on based on results! This is literally manual work that used to take ours and freelance designers to modify the assets! We still review the ads but 90% of the time is saved! \n3. Call Summary &amp; Action Items: We have setup otter to record all our customer calls! It auto generates transcript, summary and action items. This is then auto sync'ed to our customer database in notion so now no meeting ever gets lost again. \n4. Blogs &amp; Social Media Content: We have used AI tools like frizerly to automate the process of coming up of a content strategy using our Google search data. This is then used to automatically publish a blog on our website every day using our internal data like customer testimonials, case studies etc. The content is then repurposed into social media posts and posted automatically as well! This has helped us show up more often on Google search results and not look dead on social media tbh! It's quite impressive how AI can create full blown images for instagram posts featuring actual products etc!\n5. Auto Resolving Repetitive Support Tickets: We have been able to resolve repetitive customer support tickets using Intercom fin quite well! Other questions are still manually handled by our support team! \n\nAnd that's all I can think of rn! Following to see what others are using it for :)",

Here are a few use cases I think are helpful for almost any business:\n\n1. Faster content creation + repurposing (marketing/social media) AI can help generate ideas or turn one concept into multiple formats: posts for different platforms, story/script ideas, and it can also improve or help create captions, descriptions, headlines, and versions for different tones and audiences. This saves time and makes posting consistently easier, without burnout.\n2. Call summaries + follow-up support for sales. After speaking with a potential client, you can use AI to quickly create a short call summary, highlight key points (what the client needs, their questions, concerns), and draft a follow-up message: an email or a short text with clear next steps.\n3. Customer support + FAQ automation A simple chatbot/support assistant that answers common questions and hands off complex cases to a human. Saves time and improves response speed.\n4. Internal knowledge base search So your team can ask things like “what’s our refund policy?” or “how do we price X?” and get answers directly from your docs. Saves time and makes work smoother for everyone.\n5. Basic operational automations Workflows like: form submitted → create a deal in the CRM → assign an owner → send an onboarding email → set a follow-up task. It removes a lot of unnecessary steps and simplifies the workflow.\n6. Data cleanup + research. AI can help with lead categorization, summarizing competitor pages and reviews, and spotting recurring patterns in customer feedback.\n\nOne key point: the best ROI usually comes from embedding AI into an existing workflow, not trying to replace everything at once. Start with one bottleneck (support, sales, admin) and measure the impact.",

But you have to master the skill you wanna outsource to AI.\n\nAs a tech founder, I started to use CLI tool for development purposes to help me in my prototyping but I am sure a sales rep or a marketing guy could find some tasks he knows well enough to outsource it to AI tools.\n\nHowever tools are pretty mature in the coding / development fields and not so much in the sales area at the moment.\n\nSo I ll say:  \n  \n1- coding / development is a mature field where you can use AI.\n\n2- Sales, SEO, marketing and personal branding are emerging but careful about what tools you are choosing most of them aren't helping much (this is part of the reason I built my own to be quit honest).\n\n3- I also heard about after-sales service or customer services use cases that are taking care of with AI but watch out anything with video or voice is AI slop as of today (jan 2026).\n\nHope it helps!",

And then it's gone.\n\nMeanwhile, a handful of founders treat their fundraise like a marketing moment and the difference in outcomes is wild.\n\nWhy does this even matter?\n\nHere's what most founders don't realize: a fundraising announcement isn't just \"news.\" It's one of the only moments where you have a legitimate reason to be loud. You have something to say. People expect you to share it. And if you do it right, you're not just announcing money. You're doing three things at once:\n\n1. Building credibility. When your announcement gets traction, future investors see momentum. It makes the next round easier. The halo effect is real.\n2. Driving signups. A viral fundraising moment doesn't just impress VCs. It brings in users who were on the fence. People want to be part of something that's clearly working.\n3. Creating leverage. When everyone's talking about you, recruiting gets easier. Partnerships open up. Press reaches out. You're suddenly on people's radar.\n\nBest example I've seen: Arlan Rakhmetzhanov dropped a cinematic video recreating that famous scene from The Social Network. It hit 2-3 million views across LinkedIn and X. Investors reached out. Other founders started talking about him.\n\nThe money matters. But the attention you get for free might matter more.",

Basically, you need to be able to do every role proficiently. The best place to learn that is whatever job you're working. Every business has some of the same basic roles.And you're already there, and you're already being paid for doing something. It can take years to develop these skill sets just like going to college.\n\nYour knowledge and experience needs to be developed again. That can be done at any job that you work. You just have to be creative.\n\nThen, you also need to develop your character. Your personal value let's say. Everyone thinks they have good character.Because they feel like they're moral or honest.But that's not what i'm talking about. Grit, discipline, fortitude, perseverance, courage, dialectical thinking, aggressive patience......\n\nThe good news is, you can work on all of these things simultaneously, while becoming the best in whatever role you're working at whatever job.\n\nListen to biographies on founders podcast. Don't allow personal the judgments of the business owners or famous people that they cover cloud the ability to learn the lessons. It's a buffet.Take what you want and leave the rest.\n\nI learned so much about what we call the robber barons, listening to these and then doing further reading myself over the years. Many of these people that are framed as these evil individuals lived amazing lives of hardship. They started in times and circumstances that we cannot even fathom, and they did things that haven't ever been repeated. There's lots of obscure people from different industries that you can learn a lot of lessons from as well. This helps you think more like a business owner and not an employee.Because there's a severe difference in that mindset that most people wont make the jump across.\n\nI have listened to Jim Rohn every day since my early twenties. I probably have every word he's ever spoken memorized.But I still listen to it because I still glean things from it.\n\nYou gotta work harder on yourself than you do your job. You can have more because you can become more valuable. Money's not the most important thing in the world, but it's up there with oxygen as far as tools go.\n\nIt's definitely a journey, not a destination. And you may spend 10 years building your personal value and finding something of value to bring to the marketplace and still fail.\n\nAt the end of the day, your goal is to find something of value and bring it to the marketplace.

Last year I landed this marketing agency that became my anchor client steady projects, $1,000-1,200 a month, super professional, paid within 48 hours every time. I'm thinking this is what sustainable freelancing looks like. Around November they tell me their business partner is launching a new venture and needs a developer. \"You'd be perfect for this, they're great to work with, we've been in business together for 6 years.\" I take the referral because of course I do. Good client vouching for someone, easy decision. First call with the referral and I can already tell something's off. Vague about requirements, keeps saying \"we'll figure it out as we go,\" but I push through because I trust my original client's judgment. Project starts and it's a nightmare. Constantly changing scope, wants daily updates, questions every decision, rude on calls. \"Why is this taking so long?\" \"I found a template that does this in 10 minutes.\" \"My nephew said he could build this.\" I'm bending over backwards trying to make it work detailed documentation, extra calls, revisions I'm not charging for. Two months in I finally realize this isn't going to get better. I send a professional email saying I don't think we're the right fit, offered to transition everything to another developer, even gave them a partial refund for the hassle. They lose it. Email my original client saying I \"abandoned their project\" and \"wasted their time.\" Suddenly my anchor client is cold. \"You made me look bad in front of my partner.\" \"I vouched for you.\" Haven't gotten a new project from them since. It's been two months.\n\nThat referral didn't just cost me one bad client, it killed a $10K/year relationship I spent a year building. The thing that kills me is I don't even know what I was supposed to do differently. Keep working with someone who made every day miserable? Or stand my ground and lose my best client anyway? How do you handle nightmare referrals from good clients without torching the relationship? Or do you just never take referrals?",

The only time that you can really end this relationship with the bad client without upsetting the other client is to make sure that you don’t take on a bad client.\n\nOnce you have a bad client, you have to stick to your process.

If you need time to decide what you want or what you need that's fine, and if you change your mind while we work we can stop and I'll quote out the changes and upon your approval of the new quote I'll continue. However if you're unwilling to define exactly what you want I can't then appropriately quote and charge you for the work.\"\n\nThen demanding to set his expectations before you guys started and if he couldn't have that then cut it off before it started. \n\nThings like \"now we have the exact scope of the project you want, it's gonna cost 5000 and take 12 weeks.\" I personally always pad the time I actually think it's gonna take, for mechanic work I like to give myself an extra hour so I look good when I finish under that or when I encounter problems unplanned for it's not quite so bad when I tell the customer I need more time cause this bolt was rusted and this one broke off etc.\n\nFinally with the daily updates I would have told him \"Sir you're not my only customer, I'll have your work done in the time frame I gave and I can provide a once a week update as I have other customers and some days I might be working on their projects and some days I'll be working on yours so daily updates won't be productive and just cost me time I could be using to work on your project to tell you \"I coded some letters\". Or \"I am working on someone's else's project today\".\n\nThe other junk he said about the templates and his nephew said something my reply to those comments are \"Ok then why did you choose to hire me instead of doing that?\"\n\nThe psychology of that is using the why questions to make the customer justify in his head why he was right to hire you and it has them define to you what pain points and problem he thinks you're solving for him. Then you take those and use them to point out and rejustify your value to him. \n\nWhile there are plenty of Karen and obnoxious ass hats I find you can either put them in line with strict procedures and rules while setting expectations clearly ahead of time or they will say \"Well I don't like that\" and you simply reply with \"Well I'm not the only web designer on the planet, if you want someone else to do this project who will give you daily updates you can find someone else who will as I am probably just not the right fit.\".

Use that data to create an FAQ or addendum to contract or discovery call checklist or whatever. It's your business. You're in charge. Yes, you need clients and income but you get to decide who your best client is, know why that works when it works, and require courteous and professional engagement within boundaries you set. \n\nGood luck!",

          "body": "You’re not imagining it. This is very common on LinkedIn right now. High likes and comments don’t mean buying intent. Most engagement is performative, people commenting to stay visible in their own network rather than because they’re interested in clicking, DMing, or purchasing. A lot of what looks authentic is driven by automation, engagement pods, or templated replies. Not always bots, but close enough that it feels real and still converts to nothing.\nShared posts are especially weak for results. LinkedIn aggressively suppresses outbound links, and reshares almost never drive referral traffic. Seeing zero visitors even with thousands of likes isn’t unusual. On top of that, commenters are rarely leads. Real buyers usually lurk, save the post, or Google you later. They don’t ask public questions or say they’re “interested” in the comments.\nWhat actually works on LinkedIn is slower and less exciting. Posting consistently from your own founder profile, speaking directly to problem-aware buyers, and treating LinkedIn as a conversation and positioning channel rather than a traffic source. At YellowInk, we only see results when businesses stop chasing vanity metrics and focus on message and positioning over 30–60 days.\n\n\nTL;DR: LinkedIn isn’t broken, but paid shoutouts mostly are. Your spend didn’t buy leads, but it did buy clarity.",

He specifically wanted this textured raised ink effect which required puff printing and that added to the cost but he said no problem. I ordered all the blank hoodies, did the setup work, printed everything, shipped it all out in early December. He confirmed delivery and even sent me a photo saying they looked great.   \nThen last week I got notified by my payment processor that he filed a dispute claiming the quality wasn’t as described and he wants a full refund including the deposit. I reached out immediately with all our email correspondence, the approved design files, his confirmation photo, everything. The payment processor said they’re still reviewing but it could go either way.   \nI’m out almost $4000 in materials and labor if this goes through.

Respond with a tight “chargeback packet”Invoice + order summary (200 hoodies, puff print, total, deposit terms)\n\n* Proof of approval (email threads + final mockups)\n* Proof of delivery (carrier tracking + signature if you have it)\n* Proof of satisfaction (his photo + “looks great” message)\n* Your refund/quality policy and that custom goods are non-refundable once produced\n* Any timestamps showing the dispute is weeks after delivery\n\n1. Call your processor and push for “representment” Ask what reason code it is and what evidence they weigh most for that code. Use their exact checklist.\n2. Send a formal demand letter Even without a lawyer, a short written demand (amount owed, deadline, evidence, next steps) can scare scammers. A local small-business attorney can write it cheaply if needed.\n3. If you have his company details, invoice the business and pursue small claims $4k is often within small-claims limits. Your documentation sounds strong.\n4. Protect yourself going forward\n\n* For custom orders: “No refunds after approval/production” in writing\n* Consider 60–100% upfront for large custom runs\n* Signed proof at delivery, photo of finished goods before ship\n* Pay via ACH/wire for big B2B jobs (harder to chargeback)\n* Add a clause: disputes must be raised within X days of delivery\n\nNot legal advice, but with an approval trail + delivery proof + “looks great” message, you have a solid case for winning the dispute. If you tell me which processor (Stripe/Square/PayPal/etc.) and what dispute reason code they gave, I can help you structure the response.",

          "body": "Brutal situation, and it happens more than people think with custom work. The hard part is not just “winning the dispute,” it’s that one chargeback can create a cash crunch because you already paid for blanks, labor, shipping, and you cannot resell the product. That’s why for big custom orders you want a simple system that treats chargebacks like a predictable risk: clear written approvals, “custom goods are final” terms, signature delivery, and milestone payments before shipment so you are never carrying the full cost.\n\nThis is also exactly why weekly cash planning matters. If one dispute can put you underwater, it means there is no buffer for shocks. A weekly view of minimum cash you refuse to dip under, big payments coming up, and what is safe to spend this week keeps one bad customer from becoming a business-threatening week. If you share the dispute reason and whether you have signature delivery, I can tell you what evidence usually matters most in the response.",

      "selftext": "So I’ve worked at a small waffle and coffee shop for about 3 years. It’s a small operation in downtown of a large city. The owner recently offered to sell me the business for $65,000. His reasoning is that he wants to free up capital to put into another business he’s scaling, and he feels comfortable passing this one on to me since I already run much of the day-to-day. They’re hardly there in person at this point, maybe once a month or every other month to collect the cash. We’re located in a small food hall under an office building, so there’s a constant supply of costumers from there. Not enough to keep our numbers where we want, but it helps make sure we’re never actually dead I think. We’re also located right by the theatre district so whenever there’s ballet shows or operas it guarantees some traffic. The rent is also taken by the food hall as a percentage of our sales so whenever it’s slow we don’t get hurt too badly. Another factor maybe worth considering is that we partnered with Starbucks, so we buy their products and can sell them, something he already paid the license for.\n\nSome numbers:\n\n•\tMonthly sales usually fall between $5k–$7k per week. Highs of 8k+\n\n•\tAverage month is around $30-35k. Busy months can get close to $40k, slowest (usually just January) is around 25\n\n•\tHe claims the business nets about $3k–$4k in profit per month\n\nWhat I’m trying to figure out:\n\n•\tOn the surface, does a $65k asking price sound reasonable given those numbers?\n\n•\tWhat specific documents should I ask to see before even considering this seriously?\n\n•\tWhat questions should I be asking about expenses, lease terms, debt, equipment, etc.?\n\n•\tWhat are common things first-time buyers overlook in situations like this?\n\nI’m not rushing into anything — just trying to educate myself before I say yes or no. I appreciate any insight from people who’ve bought or sold small businesses before.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEdit : I’ve seen it brought up and forgot to mention originally, but equipment is rented from the food hall so we don’t pay for repairs.\n\nThis was a bit of a passion project originally for the owners, but they’ve been too busy with their other jobs and their family to dedicate the time theyd like to it. I have a great relationship with them and consider them friends at this point. All the other owners of the stalls in this food hall are personally here most if not every day, but it’s been a point of pride for me to manage this place without them needing to be here. We have a small team but everyone’s awesome and covers whenever needed\n\nThe 3-4k profit would be after all expenses, including my current wages and inventory. There’s also ways to save money, for example they spend a ton on delivery for ingredients since theyre too busy to go to the store themselves.\n\nAlso this is not a franchise.",

If you have a point of sale like Square, that should give you reliable info on the income. For expenses, ask for a years worth of invoices for everything. Utilities, cost of goods sold, payroll, insurance, etc.  you can trust during the initial conversations, but verify prior to signing anything. Be thorough. Rebuild the books from scratch with data backed up by the receipts. \n\nHere’s what I’d do:\n\nOffer X price for the business, plus real value of any inventory to be calculated at close the day before the sale. \n\nThe X should include fair market value for any tangible assets (equipment, etc) and *maybe* a token amount for the goodwill. Inventory would consist of the COGS. Coffee beans, cups, napkins, etc.  don’t trust the value he says the equipment is worth. Lookup replacement cost and then cut the value at least in half for being used equipment - probably more like 30-40%, as that’s what you could buy it for on eBay. \n\nHe’s clearly distracted by another venture. So what happens if you quit? He just closes the place down and walks away, at which point you come in and open it fresh your way.",

          "body": "Let’s say $3K/month net, so $36K/year profits.  Most coffee shops sell for 2x to 3x seller’s discretionary earnings.  That gives a valuation between $72K and $108K.\n\nSo the price seems OK, but you need to factor in add-backs and takeaways.  So if, for example, one owner does the accounting for free and you are going to have to pay for it, take that away from profits.  If the shop pays for the owner’s kid’s cell phone, add that back into profits.  Also, you have to account for any tax shenanigans, like off-book pocketing of cash sales.\n\nIf the owners are putting in very little effort, and it is netting $36K a year, there is some value being realized.\n\nNormally, I would say an opportunity like this is ideal for a seller-financed deal.  You have leverage, as the person who runs the shop day to day.  You leave, he has a burden, which puts you in a negotiating position.  But it sounds like he needs the capital, so he might not be willing to finance a sale.  Usually something like 50% down and remainder from cash flow over 3-5 years is viable and forces the owners to stand behind their profit numbers - no earn out as promised, no payment.\n\n10% net profit is top-quartile earnings for a coffee shop.  They are very finicky though in terms of business model, so you need to model this shop in a spreadsheet and ask questions like “what happens if sales dip 20%?” and “What happens if the price of coffee beans goes up 50%?”  Inputs for coffee, like beans and dairy are among the most volatile commodities and small swings in price can make a 10% net disappear quickly.\n\nYou’d have to look for existential threats.  Is there a large development coming that will kill your foot traffic for nine months?  Is a major employer leaving the area?  Is office space vacancy climbing in the area?  Is the lease on the space ending any time soon?  Is the rent going up any time soon?  Are you on a bus route that is being rerouted?  Have health inspection reports been poor and the next failure brings a shutdown order?  Is there a new competitor opening up down the block?  Coffee shops don’t die from bad coffee, they die from lease failure, labour failure, and sudden loss of foot traffic.\n\nUltimately, buying a coffee shop is a lifestyle business; you are buying a job.  So if your current wage plus $30K or so a year in additional income makes that job attractive enough, it sounds like a solid buy.\n\nYou will want to ask for financial statements and evaluate all obligations like equipment leases.  It is not uncommon for a business like this to have basically no assets.  It is also not uncommon to owe a bunch to suppliers.  Income statement should show bottom line income and balance sheet should show asset values and any debts.  You are going to want to verify those financial statements against the businesses tax returns.  That will keep you from being duped.\n\nAs additional due diligence, you should have a lawyer review all commercial agreements, like lease, Starbucks, etc to ensure no concerns.  You’ll also want to make sure the deal is structured right given the entities involved.  Are you buying shares, are those shares unencumbered, is there tax liability that might survive the sale and fall on you, etc.\n\nAlso, any letter or offer should specify a working capital calculation method and amount.  Very simply, it is usually something like “Price is $75K and includes $10k or working capital. Working capital is calculated as bank accounts plus inventory plus prepaid expenses plus receivables minus accounts payable, minus accrued expenses minus accrued payroll minus accrued taxes”.  This protects you, the buyer, from any actions the seller might take to weaken your economic position.  Common things they can do: slow paying of bulls to increase accounts payable, deplete inventory, call in all outstanding receivables, clear out the bank accounts, process refunds in unsettled credit card transactions, etc.\n\nCash                = $8,000\nInventory           = $12,000\nPayables            = $6,000\nAccrued Wages/Tax   = $4,000\n\nWorkingCapital = (8,000 + 12,000) − (6,000 + 4,000)\n               = 20,000 − 10,000\n               = $10,000\n\nSo if the owner bleeds the business down to $5K and you have a deal set on a working capital of $10K, you pay $5K less for the business.  This keeps you from having to suddenly come up with another $5k in the first weeks of operation to get the business stable with enough capital to operate day to day.\n\nThe one other thing I would say you should look at with a critical eye is the equipment.  Fridges, espresso machines, etc, can all be very expensive and may be nearing end of life.  You’ll need a capital plan for that and need to make the depreciation of those devices is properly accounted for in the financials.  There would be no worse shock than buying this business making $30K a year and finding out that if the replacement of equipment was properly accounted for, it actually was losing $10K a year and now needs a $50K investment in new equipment that is about to reach end of life.",

A friend of mine used to own a sandwich franchise and he grew it to one of the top 5 stores by focusing his energy on promoting catering. Again, you can mention it to your regulars, put up signs, buy digital ads that target your zip/area code, etc.\n* Can you add another shift and operate as a ghost kitchen for evening and late night munchie delivery after the building closes? One of the benefits here is that you can start by trying it only fri/sat nights and if someone calls in sick then it's not the end of the world because the building is closed and you'll just show up as temporarily closed on the food app. Depending on what you have now, you might have to add a special oven that would let you do pizza, chicken wings, etc. You can go by a completely different name in the delivery app to avoid confusing customers.",

          "body": "First off, everyone here is right about the lease. I see you said it's a food hall, they and malls are notorious for jacking up rents based on foot traffic increases so make sure you see the actual lease you are committing to and ask if it is a flat rate or \"percentage\" lease. Given you stated that the equipment is provided I have a gut feeling your rent will be percent or per sale based in whole or part. The equipment rent is weird to me, if not bundled in the lease you need to know the exact costs associated with it. Same goes for the rest of the FF&amp;E, utility share, etc... There are hidden costs all over with a business like this and everything from your cups to your water bill can impact your profitability if the costs go up even slightly. \n\nSecond, owners do sometimes step away from cashflow generating businesses at a modest sum, but this is the exception NOT the rule. Anyone operating an absentee or near-absentee business successfully and profiting from it is unlikely to sell at a low cost and typically seeks a higher multiple due to the low effort required to operate and high cost of them to replace that recurring revenue. Be open but skeptical (you are on the right path asking what to request from them). Ask them casual questions like what they're going to do with all of the free time they have. Answers like retirement or traveling are often acceptable (especially if they are older) but if they don't seem to have any idea there's a good chance you have something lurking they are worried about. A good example right now is single owner liquor stores. As alcohol sales decline and rents increase, many of these are selling at a low price trying to exit the market and pivot to something else rather than lose everything. Think about it from all angles you possibly can. \n\nThird, when a business owner tells you they make $3k to $4k in profit each month you should ask if that includes their cashflow (or owner draws / owner pay). If it doesn't, that means that you'll personally take home this amount or about $48,000 pre-tax if you hire someone to replace you (add in your current income if you can do it all yourself). If it does include their owner draws  /cashflow it means you'll make less than this and need to find ways to support yourself while building the business. You're in Washington with no personal income tax but you will need to collect sales tax and pay the Business &amp; Occupation (B&amp;O) Tax if I'm seeing this correctly. I'd investigate the taxes being paid now and if there are any changes slated for the future as part of the due diligence since the total profit is quite low.",

          "body": "No one can give you a good idea of if you should buy or not without info on balance sheet and P&amp;L. Just because current owner says it's cash positive doesn't mean it is. You need to do some due diligence. For example, some businesses took out adjustable APR loans during the pandemic that are now coming due... you need to see what kind of debt liability, if any, this business has and if it's assumable upon purchase. For example, I have a business local to me that did this, confident on growth projections, that is now completely underwater and desperate to sell. You don't want to be on the hook for a gamble/loss situation. \n\n\n\nAfter you do the financial due diligence, you'll want to consider the lease terms, if they are assumable and, if so, how long is left. What kind of increases are permitted, etc. If you get to this point, I'd strongly recommend hiring a lease attorney to negotiate caps (usually on annual percentage increases and CAM fees) for you. This would depend, of course, on if the lease is attached to the seller personally or his business, among other things. \n\n\nIf the business has some sort of agreement with Starbucks, you also need to determine what type of contract is in place for that, how much it is, and how long it is for. \n\nFirst thing first, though, get your hands on his Financials. \n\n\nETA: a fair asking price for most businesses is 4-5xs EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization). Seeing his P&amp;L and balance sheet will tell you if his asking price is fair. Doesn't mean you can't haggle or negotiate down, though. The low asking price is a bit of a red flag for me personally, but it could genuinely be that he is desperate for cash. \n\n\nAlso check out your local SBDC branch, as they often offer free business advising services. You could sit down with an advisor and have them walk you through next sets. ",

But… if the due diligence works out this is a safe way to get into ownership. Cuz starting a business is hard and risky. \n\n- make sure you aren’t looking at that profit as your new additional pay check. From moment one you are gonna need to save every extra penny till you have significant savings to cover an issue\n\n- spend more time than you think necessary understanding risk and insurance, and consider buying more insurance than you may think is necessary. I say this because a $1-2m umbrella policy is relatively cheap. But some dumb lawsuit for a few $100k in damages would wipe out your small business",

          "body": "Wise has been the most reliable for us with contractors in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus. The key is making sure your contractor sets up a proper Wise account on their end - they can receive in USD and hold it there or convert to local currency when rates are favorable.\n\nFew things that help avoid AML flags on the receiving end:\n\n1. Consistent, documented payments on a regular schedule (invoices help)\n2. Amounts that match what you'd expect for contractor work, not round numbers that look like crypto cashouts\n3. Having them receive directly into Wise rather than converting through local banks\n\nPayoneer works too but I've found their fees slightly higher for smaller amounts. SWIFT is fine but slow and expensive ($25-40 per transfer depending on banks).\n\nFor Georgia specifically, TBC Bank and Bank of Georgia both have decent USD account options if your contractor wants a local bank account that's crypto-separate. The issue your dev had was likely the P2P exchange triggering the flag, not the payment source itself.\n\nEOR is overkill for a single contractor unless you're planning to hire more in Georgia or need the legal protection of having them as an employee.",

FYI, thats not how an auction should work.. I was the highest bidder, and there was no reserve. I have done some business with them before and would plan on doing it in the future so I prefer to be problem adverse, so I just said ok, you can wire me back my money. He says he will try to convince the seller to release it for that amount. About 3 weeks pass with me calling weekly until just over a week ago he says \"Sorry, I'm going to tell my boss to send you back your money\" (His boss is his dad). It's been a week and some change now and nothing. I tried calling him and his dad every day this week, left voicemails, no response, no callback. This is all very unprofessional and frustrating, at what point do I take them to small claims court or something else to get my money back? Any other suggestions?",

Open ended questions: instead of telling them what you think is wrong ask them \"Well what would happen if none of the stuff I left you got done?\"\n\nThese tend to help you get across a point without you telling them and they usually will realize your point on their own. Or you realize they don't understand the purpose behind the work and you can clarify it. \n\n2. Mirroring: basically you repeat the last couple words they said or in the sentence they said in a question. \n\nExample: \nX: well lashaun never had me do any of that, just deal with customers. \n\nYou: Never had you do that?\n\nX: yeah she said it was all manager stuff anyways. \n\nThis will always get people to expand on something or explain. \n\nYou can also purposely say something a little incorrect back to them and they will instinctively want to correct you and give you more information. \n\nExample:\n\nX: well lashaun never had me do any of that, just deal with customers. \n\nYou: Had you do everything?\n\nX: No no no, she told me that was all manager stuff so she never had me do that stuff. \n\n3. Commit with a no, people feel safe saying no, so instead of trying to get them to say yes to something, rephrase your question to a no. \n\nExample:\n\nWould I be crazy to ask you to just finish the list I give you for work? \n\nAm I being an asshole to tell you to take out the trash? \n\nEtc.\n\n4. \"Seems like\", similar to mirroring but you make an assumption, start it with seems like, looks like, feels like, sounds like, etc and state your assumption of what you think is happening and let them comment on it or correct you. \n\nExample:\n\nYou: It seems like Lashaun never properly trained you. \n\nX: Yeah she never did any training with me .......\n\nOr\n\nYou: Seems like you feel underpaid and treated like shit. \n\nX: I mean I could always use more pay but you have actually been pretty fine as a boss.\n\n5. Put them together, you can use those techniques together to basically pull lots of information from this employee, understand them and their viewpoint completely, and then from this understanding help them shift it by aligning what you want them to do with their thoughts, feelings, goals, etc.\n\nEdit: forgot one, similar to the seems like, but basically you call out what you think they might feel when you say something. \n\nDon't say \"I'm not trying to be an asshole\" instead call it out \"I'm probably gonna be an asshole for saying this\" then say what you want to say. People tend to handle it much better when you call it out ahead of time.",

Whether that is in the form of official employee handbook policies, a written job description, or a list of tasks that need to be completed during their shift. Likely all of the above. Said SOP should be reviewed with each employee and have them sign off on it, which goes in their file.

          "body": "There were several reasons to pull your email from other services into Gmail using POP3 retrieval. For some of them there are workarounds, for others not.\n\n1. You want to read all your email from two or more servers in one email client, i.e., Gmail.\n\n2. You want to back up all your email received on other servers in an online archive without paying for the storage, preferably one with lots of capacity, good search tools, good security, and easily accessible from anywhere, i.e. Gmail. (Presumably you also keep a local copy if you are smart.)\n\n3. You want to take advantage of Gmail's spam filtering and flexible auto filters applied to incoming email.\n\nThe solution that satisfies all 3 and is pretty much equivalent to what is being lost is to simply turn the direction of communications around and have your other email servers forward all email to Gmail instead of having Gmail retrieve the email by POP3 polling. This satisfies all 3 of the functions and it's faster (forwarding happens in seconds, whereas Gmail polls at irregular intervals which can stretch to hours). Problems: your other email services may not have a \"forward all\" function, or they may add a header which makes it look like the forwarded mail is coming from you rather than the original sender. And then there's the spam issue: there's a danger that dumb spam-blockers may decide that you are the originator of any spam among the emails that you are forwarding to Gmail, and therefore your email address should be blacklisted as a spammer (and yes, this does happen - I've encountered it, had to give up forwarding).\n\nOther partial solutions:\n\nThe Gmail app (not the web interface) allows you to view email from your other services together with your Gmail in the common Gmail interface. You just add your other services to the app as additional email sources. But this is view-only. This satisfies function#1. It does not retrieve that email and add it to your Gmail account, so no good for functions #2 and #3.\n\nYou can use an IMAP-enabled email client like Thunderbird, both on the desktop and as an app. Thunderbird lets you add Gmail (via IMAP) and your other IMAP/POP servers in one interface. And it lets you copy email to and from IMAP clients like Gmail. So it satisfies functions #1 and #2, although you have to do the copying manually. Sadly Gmail does not apply incoming email rules or spam filtering to email copied in via IMAP., so function #3 is out.",

Not because I was bad at it, not because I didn’t care, and not because I didn’t try. I genuinely gave it my best. I grew, took responsibility, learned fast, and showed up every day trying to do meaningful work.\n\nAnd then it ended. \n\nWhat followed was months of job searching, applications, interviews, silence, rejections, and a slow erosion of confidence. If you’ve been there, you know the feeling: days start blending together, motivation becomes fragile, and at some point you quietly start wondering if maybe you’re just… not that good after all.\nThat part hit me harder than I expected.\nSo instead of staying stuck in that loop, I’ve decided to try something different — and honestly, pretty terrifying.\n\nI’m going to try to build a small company of my own. 💀\n\nI don’t have a safety net. I don’t have funding. I don’t have some romantic “always wanted to be an entrepreneur” backstory. What I do have is a background in digital content, UX, learning design, and product thinking — basically, turning messy ideas into clear, usable things that actually help people. I’ve spent years doing that for organizations. Now I’m going to try doing it for myself.\n\nWith little to no real business experience.\nThis subreddit (and Reddit in general) feels like the right place to do this, because it’s basically the collective brain of the internet — smart, skeptical, supportive when it counts, and very good at calling bullshit. I don’t want to pretend I have it all figured out. I don’t. That’s kind of the point.\n\nMy plan is to share:\nwhat I’m trying to build\nthe decisions I make (good and bad)\nwhat I learn along the way\nthe mistakes, doubts, small wins, and inevitable faceplants\n\nNot as a “guru journey,” but as a real, ongoing process of trying to take responsibility for my own life after it didn’t go the way I planned.\nIf nothing else, I want this to be honest. And if it does work — even a little — I want to be able to say I didn’t give up on myself when it would’ve been easier to do so.\n\nIf you’ve been through layoffs, career detours, or that quiet feeling of “I know I can do good things, why doesn’t life seem to agree?”, you’re not alone. And if you’re curious to follow along, offer advice, criticism, or just lurk… I’d genuinely appreciate having you here.\nI’ll post my first concrete step soon.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nYours truly, \n\nD",

You can get away with missing 1 or 2 payments on operations, not much beyond that.  Make sure there are no overdraft fees or nsf fees with this account.

The best-selling car in the US is the Ford F150, with an average sold price of about $66,000. \n\nIf everybody is so broke, why isn't the most popular car an economy car? Why are none of the top 10 most-popular cars economy cars? \n\nI think the issue (and I'm making a point in a second) is that the average person is not buying new cars. They're holding onto the car they had, not replacing cars once they break permanently, and buying used. Who's buying cars has skewed. \n\nI think the same thing is happening with business launches. My business-plan clients are coming to me better-prepared, both in education and financing, than they did 10 years ago. So i think what we're seeing is better-funded startups able to afford those rents. The people who can't are still at their day job(s). \n\nThe arguments that businesses signed a lease x number of years ago falls flat with me. Most commercial leases are 3 years, especially for new businesses. Even big franchisees usually sign for 5 years with a renew option. People aren't paying rent on 15-year old leases. And even if their lease was low, their NNN has probably exploded lately. \n\nFew people own a commercial property that they can use AND live in the building. Most of those are professionals with an office on the ground floor and living space upstairs. They're not what you think of when you're talking about a store or gym or convenience store. Maybe a couple of hundred thousand people across all categories of own/work/live in the US. It certainly does nothing to explain businesses justifying high rent.",

While these methods can work, they often require a lot of manual effort. That’s where [WebIeadr](https://webleadr.pages.dev) comes in. A platform where web designers, developers, SEO specialists, and similar professionals can easily find and contact web design leads such as businesses without websites, in just a couple of clicks, along with many other features (check the website to explore all of them)!\n\nWebIeadr offers a one-time, credit-based system: **$12 for 100 business leads**. No subscriptions or recurring fees: pay only when needed. Credits stay in your account and can be used anytime, with options to buy more as needed. For example, if 40 out of 100 leads lack websites and 15 use third-party services (e.g., Facebook), and you secure just a mere 3 clients with basic sales skills, you could earn around $2,000. Your cost? Just $12\n\nThe bottom line is that WebIeadr offers an extremely quick and efficient solution to find web design leads in just a few clicks and **call them in just one click of a button**. From there, all you need to do is apply your sales skills to convince them that having a website is a worthwhile investment for their business.\n\nKnow a web designer, developer, or SEO specialist who could benefit from this? Please share this post with them. They’ll thank you later!",

Whether you're a tradesperson, consultant, freelancer, or growing business, the right number can make you instantly recognisable and easier to reach.\n\n\nWhy it matters:\n- Brand recall: A clean, memorable number sticks in your customer’s mind long after the conversation ends.  \n- Professional image: It signals that you take your business seriously and pay attention to the details.  \n- Customer trust: People are more likely to call a number that feels simple, clear, and intentional.  \n- Marketing impact: Whether on vans, business cards, websites, or ads, a standout number boosts response rates.\n\n\nAt SimpleSimUK.com, we've built a small startup focused on helping UK professionals secure premium, easy‑to‑remember mobile numbers without the usual hassle or inflated prices. It’s a simple idea, but one that genuinely elevates how people perceive your brand.\n\n\nIf you’re building your business, levelling up your personal brand, or just want a number that works as hard as you do, take a look at what we are creating.\n\n\n🌍 https://www.SimpleSimUK.com\n\n📞 +44 7777 787171\n\n\nSmall details build strong brands and your number is one of them.\n\n\n#SimpleSimUK #PersonalBranding #ProfessionalBranding #UKBusiness #SmallBusinessUK #StartupLifeUK #EntrepreneurMindset #BrandIdentity #MemorableNumbers #VIPNumbers #TradesBusiness #ConsultantLife #FreelancerTips #MarketingEssentials #CustomerExperience #StandOutFromTheCrowd",

Yes, I should have had back-ups, but unfortunately I don't have that content anywhere else. The changes were made on Squarespace, which (from my understanding), you can't recover previous versions of the web pages.\n\nAt this point, I need to accept that the content is gone. My question is how to approach this with the contractor. Here is some info that may be relevant -\n\n1. The contractor has made their own individual attempts to recover the data, which was unsuccessful.\n2. Contractor has also sent me the invoice for the time that they spent on my website (which included deleting most of my content).\n3. Contractor has suggested using AI or hiring a copywriter to try to regenerate the content. I don't use/like generative AI, though hiring a copywriter is still an option.\n4. I'm thinking about implications of this on my business, not just with the content itself, but with SEO rankings and the like.\n5. To make things more complicated, the contractor is a personal friend of mine.\n6. The last time the Wayback Machine crawled through my website was April 2025 :( \n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what I can expect from the contractor to make things right.
