      "selftext": "I jumped into the event rental business (weddings, parties, etc) in June 2024. I realized how lucrative the wedding industry is and after spending a couple months watching TheRentalGuy on YouTube, I decided to take a shot.\n\nI had no idea how small or large I wanted to be. So, as most of us do, I faked it until I made it. After the LLC, I created a logo and put a listing on Facebook marketplace for table and chair rentals — the standard white padded chairs, round and rectangular tables. I posted about 8pm on a Friday and by 8:30pm I received my first booking… for a 300 person party! I owned nothing. I almost turned it down but instead I decided to ensure it was legitimate by meeting for a cash 50% deposit. I then spent $10k purchasing the equipment new (the rental was for $1500 a few months later, so I had time).\n\nI made 8k that August-December, then in 2025 business picked up about February again (seasonal) and I cleared just at 40k by EOY.\n\nThe 2 things I underestimated the most was the sheer size and space you need — I ran it out of a 16x22 detached garage. I had enough room to move around but had to be strategic. The other thing is the maintenance (chairs mainly). The white chairs need to be cleaned about half the time after being rented out. That takes most of my time. The preparation. I have some late Friday nights if I push it off until then to prep for the weekend, but on the weekends I’m spending maybe 3-4 hours before noon each day delivering and picking up. Some weeks a lot less work depending on the shape of the equipment and different factors.\n\nIt is the least passive of income there is. I’ve since purchased an enclosed trailer. And I’m worn out a lot.  If I can say no anytime. But on the other hand, once it’s paid off, it sure if nice to make a random $500 for maybe 2 hours worth of work on a Saturday morning. Between March and October, some weekends I make $200, others I make $3000. It’s solely up to how much time and inventory you have.\n\nYear 1 was a larger scale than I expected and I spread myself thin at times but I can scale back as much as I want. Even with 1/4 the equipment, a lot of $ can be made. It’s a great side hustle if you have the physical ability.",

The catch is nobody tells you about it, obviously they are not going to announce that stuff, you have to go find it yourself.  \n  \nEach claim takes maybe 15-20 min, most don't even need receipts, just need you to confirm you used whatever service during the right dates, I've gotten checks for $8 and checks for $340. average is probably around $75, but just know that it takes time  \n  \nAt first I was just googling and checking sites manually, it was okay but I couldnt remember all the services I used like 4 years ago (I cant even remember what I had for lunch yesterday lol), around june I tried using settlemate bc it flags based on actual purchases and accounts, I try to batch them, knock out 3-4 claims during lunch or while watching something.  \n  \nThe downsides are real tho, money is slow as hell, some pay in 6 weeks, some take like 8 months, you need patience, also this isn't replacing actual income, it's more like the same category as survey apps or cashback stuff, small effort, small returns, but it adds up.  \n  \nIf you're already doing beer money type things this fits right in, won't make you rich but $1200 for maybe 10 total hours of work spread across the year really helped me, I track everything in a spreadsheet so I know what's pending vs what already hit.",

Did it mostly while waiting for coffee or on the bus in the mornings , nothing fancy, just a few sessions a day. \n\nOutcome: not nearly as lucrative as the hype. After about three weeks I had maybe $10–20 worth of gift cards/points across everything and one app hit a payout threshold that took forever to reach. A couple of apps (Mistplay was one I tried) gave small rewards here and there but also felt like a grind, and one locked my account for a day which was annoying. \n\nIt wasn't a scam, more like a low-value time sink for me , fine if you want something mindless while watching Netflix, but not something I'd call a reliable side hustle.

One of our main selling points was that it worked offline and added tasks even without the internet. We tested the hell out of it. service workers, cache API, the whole deal. And it  worked flawlessly and we were so proud.\n\nNow, Fast forward to last week. Our app store rating 3.1 stars\n\nthe reviews were brutal \"offline mode doesn't work. tried on plane, nothing saved\"\n\n\"says it works offline but lost all my tasks when Wi-Fi came back\"\n\n\"false advertising tbh\"\n\nI was SO confused because it worked perfectly for me. opened dev tools, went offline, added tasks, went back online - everything synced. Then i checked our analytics chrome users: offline mode success rate 94% safari users offline mode success rate 38%\n\noh no!!!. We got to know that safari's service worker implementation is... how do i put this nicely like it’s Complete garbage. Specifically, Safari doesn't cache POST requests with service workers. Our app's core action was submitting a new task (POST request). So when iOS users went offline and added tasks, the service worker just... silently failed. they'd see the task in the UI (optimistic update), reconnect to Wi-Fi, and Boom!!! it's gone.\n\nI shipped a flagship feature that literally didn't work for 60% of mobile users.\n\nAnd the worst part? i only tested on chrome. my MacBook, my android phone, chrome dev tools. never once opened safari dev tools. We spent the last 4 days rebuilding with indexedDB + a sync queue that batches requests when connection returns. Now it actually works on safari. The new ratings were 4.2 stars and climbing.\n\nNow suggestions….If you're building a PWA and marketing offline functionality, TEST ON SAFARI and I would suggest testing it on drizz(dot)dev or xyz or any other tool out there. And don’t just \"open it and click around\" but actually profile the service worker behavior. safari and chrome are not the same.\n\nAnd from now ain’t no way we are using \"works offline!\" as a marketing point again….\n\n until we've tortured tested it on every browser lol….\n\n",

I live in a relatively small enough town,  where I don't think Uber would be that great of an option, and I don't really want to rack miles up on my car.\n\nAnd before anyone mentions it; the nearest plasma donation is about 20 miles away.

Picked up a few one-off gigs on Fiverr for editing and voiceover stuff and that netted maybe $150. Also tutored a neighbor's kid twice a week and got about $100 out of that.\n\nI even tried Mistplay for a week just to see what it was like, no drama there, but it was barely a blip compared to the other stuff. Overall it was messy and tiring but the thing that surprised me was how fast selling things locally moved money. The reliable platforms and real gigs paid steadier than the random micro options. Not saying this is a plan, just sharing what actually happened when I was desperate and had time to hustle. Maybe others had similar mixes? idk.",

It gets the job done, but before I invest more time and money or lock myself into one setup long-term, I want to make sure I’m choosing something that fits how I actually work.

Every small uncertainty felt like a flaw in the model. Every slow week felt like a red flag. Building something that compounds over time just didn’t sit well with someone who needed constant confirmation.\n\nThat experience stuck with me.

      "selftext": "Hello. I am a 21F looking for side hustles, or even jobs, I can do on campus. Before the semester started, I quit my job because I was miserable and I knew I would get stable income if I enrolled again (I receive educational benefits). However, I still want money to spoil myself. I had issues getting my unis work-study application available to me before all spots were taken. I’m looking for a direct wage job, but in the meantime, would like a decent side gig. \n\nIve done both irl and online jobs, mostly customer service. Recently, I’ve been making my fun money with random construction gigs (my family has a business, but really only looks for work when money is tight) and online “modeling” and “acting” (I’m doing it anyways, why not record it and sell it 🤷).  \n\nI’m ideally looking for something less labor intensive than construction, less boring than work at home or less stressful constant phone calls. (I understand I might be picky, but I’m open to both ideal and realistic suggestions! Thank you &lt;3)",

          "body": "The comments are ridiculous... people are giving you trouble for 30 minutes of cleaning and saying it's not passive income. No income is truly passive income, there is always some work that needs to go into it. I think this is good enough because you technically could hire a cleaner, but since it's such a small space and conveniently attached to the house, you don't really need to. \n\nFurthermore, all these people questioning the 30min clean-time probably aren't considering the fact that these are mostly short stays and a very small space as you mentioned (300sqft I believe). If it takes you 2+ hours to clean 300sqft space after someone lived in it for 2-3 days, then I would be quite concerned about your efficiency or the tenants themselves. \n\nI used to live in an 800 sqft apartment years ago and it would only take me 30min every few days to upkeep my place. This includes running a robot vacuum, doing a second pass with my dyson, mopping, running dishwasher, dusting and cleaning a single washroom. Once in a while (maybe every 1-2 months), I'll do a deep clean which would take an hour. I've received multiple compliments about cleanliness from guests + I'm OCD as well. \n\nSo really not sure why people are questioning you at all. ",

      "selftext": "I'm an accountant and last June I was watching TikTok at midnight when I saw some faceless account explaining credit cards with 2 million views. I thought I could do that and made my first video the next day.\n\nGot 147 views. My mom didn't even watch it.\n\nMade 11 more videos over three weeks. Highest was 380 views. Gave up for a month because it felt pointless. Then in August I posted one about savings accounts and it randomly got 50k views overnight. No idea why that one worked.\n\nThat's when I actually tried. The free text to speech sounded awful so I switched to APOB for the avatar stuff. It's not perfect, someone commented \"bro sounds like he's underwater\" which was fair, but I can make a video in 15 minutes now.\n\nI post 3 or 4 times a week after dinner. Account is at 7400 followers. Some videos get 30k views, some get 900. I made one explaining APR that I thought was solid and it died at 600 views. Then made one about Costco memberships as a joke and it got 40k. Algorithm is completely random.\n\nMoney breakdown last month: $47 from creator fund, $248 from affiliate link in my bio, had 31 people sign up for a budgeting app I actually use, and $45 from three people who Venmo'd me to answer credit questions which was weird but whatever. Total $340.\n\nThis month is tracking around $280. It's not consistent and definitely not quit your job money but it covers internet, Spotify, and usually leaves enough for drinks on the weekend. Takes maybe 2 hours a week total.\n\nWeirdest part is people think I'm some finance guru now. Someone asked me to manage their portfolio. I'm an accountant at a mid size firm, I just know how credit cards work because I explained it to my little brother five times.\n\nAlso had someone spam \"is this AI\" on every video so I started responding \"yes I'm a robot beep boop\" and they stopped.\n\nIf you're thinking about this just pick something you know and start posting. First 15 videos will probably suck. One will randomly hit and you'll figure it out. Don't expect thousands of dollars but $200-300 a month for basically no effort is doable.\n\nStill think it's kind of dumb but my roommate stopped making fun of me after I paid for pizza with TikTok money so I guess that's something.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been researching side hustles that actually work for my newsletter but every post it’s the same recycled advice. Start a podcast. Sell printables. Drive for DoorDash. Do surveys. I got tired of seeing the same surface-level ideas repeated by people who clearly weren’t doing any of them.\n\nSo I went deep into Reddit threads, Discord servers, and niche communities to find what’s actually working for regular people right now.\n\nHere’s what kept coming up again and again\n\n1. AI-generated influencer accounts\n\nThis one sounds wild but it’s real. People are creating entirely AI-generated personas using tools like Midjourney, Flux, and HeyGen, then running them as influencer accounts on Instagram and TikTok.\n\nThe persona posts content around a niche like fitness, finance, or tech reviews. Brand deals still come in because engagement is what matters, not whether the face is real. Some people are running two or three of these at once.\n\nThe key is picking a tight niche and staying consistent with the character so the audience feels like they’re following a real person.\n\n2. Hyperlocal newsletters\n\nThis is one of the most underrated plays out there. People are starting simple email newsletters covering local news, events, restaurant openings, and community stuff for their city or neighborhood. You write one or two emails a week using a free tool like Beehiiv or Substack.\n\nOnce you hit a few thousand subscribers, local businesses will pay surprisingly well to sponsor a slot. It works because big media ignores small towns and neighborhoods, so there’s almost no competition.\n\nA guy in a mid-sized suburb shared that he’s pulling in over two thousand a month just from a twice-weekly newsletter about his area.\n\n3. Claude chatbot setups for small businesses\n\nSmall business owners keep hearing about AI but have no idea how to actually use it. People are charging anywhere from three hundred to over a thousand dollars to set up Claude-powered chatbots and workflows for local businesses.\n\nThink automated customer support for a dentist’s office, a booking assistant for a salon, or a lead qualifier for a contractor. You use tools like Claude, Zapier, and Make to wire it all together. No coding needed.\n\nOnce you’ve built a few, you can reuse templates and the work gets faster every time. Most clients will come from cold outreach or local Facebook groups.\n\n4. Amazon KDP low-content and AI-assisted books\n\nKindle Direct Publishing is still quietly printing money for people who understand the system. The sweet spot right now is using AI to help research niches, outline content, and draft specialized nonfiction like study guides, prompt collections, niche how-to books, and curated resource lists. You’re not publishing AI slop novels.\n\nThe people doing well are targeting very specific keywords with real demand and thin competition. One person shared they were making around fifteen hundred a month from a catalog of about forty short books, most of which took a day or two each to put together.\n\n5. Twitter ghostwriting\n\nBuilding a personal brand on X is a grind, but plenty of founders, executives, and creators are willing to pay someone else to do it for them. Ghostwriters handle everything from drafting daily posts to writing long threads and managing engagement.\n\nPay ranges from five hundred to several thousand per month per client depending on scope. If you can write in a punchy, opinionated style and understand what performs well on the platform, this is steady recurring income.\n\nMost ghostwriters land their first clients by simply being active on X themselves and DMing people whose accounts look neglected.\n\n6. No-code iOS apps\n\nTools like FlutterFlow, Adalo, and Draftbit have made it possible to build and ship real apps to the App Store without writing a line of code.\n\nPeople are building simple utility apps, habit trackers, niche calculators, and local service directories, then monetizing through subscriptions or one-time purchases. The barrier to entry is lower than ever.\n\nOne person in a community I follow launched a niche workout timer app and was making around eight hundred a month within three months. The trick is solving a very specific problem for a very specific audience rather than trying to compete with big apps.\n\nNone of these require a massive upfront investment or some rare technical skill. They just take consistency and willingness to learn new things.\n\nI have written detailed posts about these on my [newsletter](http://wifimoolah.com). It’s free and I do not sell anything\n\nHas anyone here tried any of these or found other low-key hustles that are actually working right now?",

At least it’s specific.\n\nThe pattern across all of these isn’t “AI magic.”  \nIt’s distribution + niche focus + packaging boring work in a smarter way.\n\nA few thoughts:\n\nAI influencer accounts  \nThis works, but only if you treat it like a real brand. Most people underestimate how hard it is to build consistent content and audience trust. The ones making money aren’t just generating pretty images. They’re running it like a media business.\n\nHyperlocal newsletters  \nThis one is quietly strong. Attention is cheaper locally. And local sponsors convert because it’s high intent. But again, distribution is the game. If you can’t grow the list, it dies.\n\nClaude setups for SMBs  \nThis feels like the most durable one on the list. It’s not sexy, but small businesses don’t want to “learn AI.” They want outcomes. Lead capture. Booking automation. Follow-ups. Whoever owns that layer wins.\n\nKDP  \nStill works, but it’s keyword research and volume. Less “author,” more “operator.” Most people quit before they build enough surface area.\n\nGhostwriting  \nThe moat isn’t writing. It’s understanding positioning and audience psychology. Big difference.\n\nOverall takeaway for me:  \nThe real opportunity isn’t in the tactic. It’s in becoming the person who can package and systemize the tactic.\n\nCurious though - if you had to double down on just one of these for 12 months, which one would you actually bet your own time on?",

          "body": "One of the most boring but reliable paths is skill based freelancing that eventually turns into repeat clients. It is not passive at first, but once you build a few steady clients or retainers, it becomes predictable monthly income. The unsexy part is doing outreach and starting conversations. I have helped many freelancers land their first clients using a simple outreach based method, and once they had 3 to 5 steady clients, income became much more stable.\n\nDigital products are another boring but steady model. Simple templates, planners, niche guides, or industry specific resources created once and sold repeatedly on platforms like Gumroad or Etsy. It usually takes a few months of testing and improving, but once one product gains traction, it can quietly generate monthly sales without much maintenance.\n\nNiche websites also fall into this category. Writing helpful articles around specific problems, monetized with affiliate links or ads, is slow at the beginning. For the first several months, it can feel like nothing is happening. But once content ranks and traffic compounds, it can turn into steady revenue. It is not glamorous, and it requires patience.\n\nPrint on demand is similar. Upload designs, test niches, optimize listings. Most designs will not sell much. But a few that connect with a niche audience can produce consistent monthly sales over time. It is repetitive work, not exciting work.\n\nDividends and index funds are probably the most boring of all. They require capital and time, and the returns look small at the beginning. But they are predictable and compound over the long term.\n\nThe pattern across all of these is the same. None of them are fast. Most take 3 to 12 months before they feel meaningful. What makes them work is choosing one, building systems around it, and sticking with it long enough for compounding to kick in.\n\nThe most unsexy income streams are usually the ones built on consistency and simple repeatable processes rather than viral wins.\n\nI’ve been breaking down these strategies step by step in my newsletter, you can find the link in my bio if you are interested.",

I personally have yet to try Prolific, but I was consistently making an extra $200 a month (\\~30min a day for 6 months) from doing surveys on cloud until I got banned for speeding through them, something I forgot they were against in their tos.\n\nYouTube - If you watch streamers, take clips from their streams, edit them, and upload them to youtube. I haven't made any money doing this yet, but I got a brand new channel to 800 subscribers and 650k views in just a month doing exactly what I just described. I've seen people making $10-20k a month doing this, but I think $100-300 is much more realistic.\n\nDaytrading - WAIT, I know how much flak it gets, but that's just because of how it's presented. People act as if it'll make you rich quick, which to be fair, it can, but a good rule of thumb is that if something could make you rich quick, it could make you poor quicker, so be careful and do a lot of research if you decide to do this. With strong pattern recognition, a ***LOT*** of discipline, and some common sense, you could definitely make a few extra $100s a month with this.\n\nTheme Pages - Find a niche (memes, beauty, cars, gaming, ect.) and make an instagram/yt/tiktok with it. After enough growth, companies will pay you thousands of dollars per post to promote their products/services. You could also do this to grow your own business, if you're interested in that.\n\nThese are the best ways that I know of that anyone could make an extra $1k a month. With all the information available to us nowadays, most of these are actually pretty easy, but they'll take a while, and you'll have to be extremely consistent, which is the real hard part.",

It ticks all the boxes:\n\n\\- Requires no technical skills or special knowledge  \n\\- Works from anywhere at any age.  \n\\- In a red-hot niche - crypto  \n\\- Involves zero trading or risk of losing any money  \n\\- Has the potential to earn passively from various streams  \n\\- Validated market and proven business model\n\nCurious what it is? It's a crypto faucet business, which is a business model that involves monetizing the existence of users by allowing users to earn tiny amounts of crypto (any crypto token of your choice) while you, as the admin, earn from ads, sponsors, and affiliates. It involves no risk and no crypto transactions at all, unless paying to winners.\n\nA lot have been asking about how they can utilize the same business turnkey to start their own site. So I actually developed a script that allows you to start a profitable crypto token faucet business in days, with ZERO coding!\n\nThis is not a scam model, a multi-level marketing thing, or a get-rich-quick scheme. It's something you can grow at your own pace while doing other things in life.\n\nHappy to share the link with anyone who'd be interested!",

Running 10 fanpages though means you're probably drowning in repetitive DMs and comments asking the same stuff over and over, which cuts into time you could spend scaling or creating better content. One thing that might help with the engagement overload is setting up better automated responses for teh FAQ stuff.\n\nI've read about creators using tools like Isonic that convert your existing content into a chatbot so fans can get instant answers without you being glued to your phone. It supposedly helps capture sales from people who would otherwise just ghost after asking questions. Worth looking into if you're trying to monetize those fan interactions more efficiently without adding hours to your day.\n\nEither way, what you've built is solid. The fact that you're thinking about group calls and paid consultations shows you're already thinking like a real business owner.",

In 2026, you can manage many data tasks directly from a smartphone using mobile versions of Google Sheets, Excel, or even basic SQL editors.\n\n**Immediate Phone-Based Steps:**\n\n* **Virtual Data Assistant:** Use the Upwork or Freelancer apps to look for 'Data Cleanup' or 'Excel Spreadsheet' tasks. Many small businesses just need someone to organize their CSV exports or write a few complex formulas—tasks you can handle on a mobile browser or app.\n* **Microtasking for Data:** Check out **Clickworker** or **Amazon Mechanical Turk**. They have data labeling and categorization tasks that require the logic you already have from SQL. It’s not a full salary, but it can help with groceries immediately.\n* **Content Automation:** Since you understand data structures, you could set up a 'Data-Driven' faceless channel using a tool like **Keyvello**. It has templates that can turn simple data facts (like financial or health stats) into videos in minutes. It’s 100% phone-friendly and can build that passive foundation you’re looking for.\n\nFocus on the freelance apps first to get that immediate cash flow.

A lot of the tasks can be done from a phone, and it doesn’t require heavy tech skills — your Excel and office background would actually help.\n\nIt’s not instant money and I don’t want to oversell it, but it is legitimate and low cost to start. If you want, I can share the info and you can decide if it’s worth your time. If not, no worries at all — just wanted to offer something that might help.",

Nearly all of my sales came from friends, neighbors and people I personally told. The store had customers but no matter how much I changed the prices or the pictures strangers weren't purchasing.\n\nThen I started searching like a customer like newborn winter outfits or best baby clothes brands. My brand did not show up. Thats when I realized people simply couldn’t find my store.\n\nWhat I actually did:\n\n* Updated product descriptions using language that customers really use to find\n* Added basic FAQs parents usually worry about (sizing, fabric comfort and washing)\n* Wrote simple guides to help first-time parents choose outfits\n* reorganized the categories to make the website easier to use.\n* I focused on the appropriate descriptions and instructions by using a tool to determine which places and search terms were bringing attention to my products.\n\nThese days the store consistently generates monthly sales and I probably put in two to three hours a week to maintain it. Although its not enough to quit your job it feels at last somewhat passive than before\n\nAnyone here started something new this year or next year? What worked for you? Share your experiences\n\n",

Too many steps. Too much setup. I’d use them for two weeks and then quit. So I built something simpler.\n\nYou can log expenses using text, voice, or photos. It auto-categorizes and splits shared spending automatically. Think WhatsApp-style logging combined with envelope budgeting.\n\nI’ve had almost no marketing budget. Growth has mostly come from organic Reddit posts, some social media content, and early users sharing it with friends.\n\nIn the last 30 days:  \n• 5,000+ installs  \n• $320 in revenue\n\nIt’s not quit-your-job money. But it’s real. Real subscriptions. Real users requesting features and leaving reviews.\n\nThe app offers a free trial if you want to see how it works. Search **Moneko: Shared Expenses AI** on iOS or Google Play. Early lifetime access is $19.99 for now.\n\nAnd if you have feedback, I’d genuinely love to hear it!!",

The worst move right now would be panicking and jumping into some easy money scheme that promises quick results. That is how people dig the hole deeper.\n\nForget passive income for now. You need stable, active income. Get the highest paying part time job you realistically can while in college. Serving, retail with commission, warehouse shifts, delivery driving if you can. It is not glamorous, but consistent cash flow is what gets you out.\n\nAt the same time, cut your expenses hard for a while. Think in 6 to 12 month mode. Live with roommates, pause unnecessary subscriptions, avoid random spending. You are not doing this forever. You are doing it to reset your position.\n\nThen pick one skill you can build that businesses actually pay for. Not ten things. One. That could be video editing, managing social media for local businesses, simple website setup, appointment setting, or sales. Spend a few months getting decent and then start offering it.\n\nYou are 18. Time is on your side. If you stay disciplined for a year, this becomes a story about how you fixed your mess early, not something that defines you long term.\n\nIf you want practical breakdowns on building income, getting out of debt and actually creating leverage step by step, I write about it in my newsletter Wealth Rewired. It is focused on real strategies, not hype. You might find it useful.",

I don’t agree with everything he does but he’s aces at motivating young people to get control of their spending habits and get out of debt. Which sounds like that’s what you need right now. \n\nDon’t worry too much about the college debt at this point if you’re studying something that makes money. If you’re going to art school or doing queer studies or some crap like that then change your major. \n\nYou can also join the Reserves or National Guard, and stay in school. They have a college debt repayment program. Or if you have an interest in becoming a military officer, look at ROTC, which is how I paid for college many moons ago. \n\nAnd there’s nothing wrong with waitressing! Don’t let anyone tell you different!",

KDP handles my soft cover sales and Ingram Spark handles my hardcover (which I make almost no money on).\n\nI sell anywhere from 5-10 books a month regularly. One month, out of nowhere, I sold 48! No idea why. I could definitely sell more if I wrote more books in the series and put some work into it but right now it’s just sitting there until I feel like doing something with it. So far I have not had to talk to a single child (success!).\n\nDid I break even? No idea. Never added anything up. Not passive enough. Probably also can’t answer any questions for you about ROI or whatever. But there it is! Ta da! ",

I had zero knowledge of AI, automation, or software. ADHD helped in one way (ambition and optimism), but hurt in another (too many tools, monthly fees, and underuse). So I forced simplicity.\n\nOne day, alone in a hotel room with no phone, I spent hours talking to ChatGPT. I realised I didn’t lack ideas — I lacked *patterns*: what lots of people consistently want, urgently, and will pay for. So instead of asking “What can I launch fast?”, I asked “What system makes sense long-term?” I studied search behaviour in high-population countries, focusing on real pain, not curiosity. One rule: simple setup + fully automated.\n\nI tested a few options, picked one, and built it using a small stack:\n\n* **ChatGPT** for creativity and ideation\n* **Claude** to design/build the website and system\n* **Perplexity** for deep research.\n* Then I used **Cloudflare** (hosting and Workers automation), **Stripe** (payments), **MailerLite/Brevo** (emails), and **HTMLtoPDF** (to convert results into a PDF report).\n\nThe model was simple: a free personalised report for a specific sector, and a paid premium version delivered automatically. No calls, no onboarding, no consulting, no manual fulfilment. It runs on its own — and it has reached **€100k** in fully automated revenue.\n\nIf I can leave you with anything:\n\n* Build around real pain points\n* Think longer than feels comfortable before committing\n* Only execute when the model is aligned and simple\n* You don’t need to understand everything upfront — learn step by step\n\nGood luck to everyone.",

After I accepted the offer, the HR manager told me that they use a Time Doctor to track the activity.\n\nNormally, I take full responsibility for honestly working all 8 hours, and I have previously experienced micromanagement with excessive control from a toxic manager. Because of that, being tracked with a software seems not so bad for me.\n\nThe issue is that I will be working in regulatory affairs, which involves a lot of research, reading, and reviewing documents. I understand that there is an idle time, and for example, if you are actively reading and thinking for 3–5 minutes, Time Doctor may consider that idle time. It also seems that you cannot use the bathroom or take a short break between tasks to think, because it generates idle time.\n\nI would like to hear about the experiences of other remote workers who use Time Doctor. Do you have problems with idle time due to research or reading tasks?\n\nSome of you might say that I should have refused a job that uses a time tracker, as it could be a red flag that the company does not trust its employees. But to be honest, the job market is insane. It took me 4 months to find this job, and I feel I have nothing to lose. If I am not satisfied with the workplace, I will simply continue searching for another job.\n\nThank you in advance.",

I actually applied for several legal transcriptionist positions: eScribers, which I am in the orientation phase, Transcribeme, which I just submitted by second probation file to see if I am accepted into \"Legal Phoenix\"... A couple of others that I have not made it passed the initial part yet / they do not seem as big of companies, as the 3 main ones are... Casting Words &amp; Transcription Hub. I have done a bit of research, and it looks like between the 3.. Allegis pays the highest, then eScribers, then Transcribeme. Transcribeme, is strictly download the files read them and learn on your own. Once you make it past the legal tests, there is a group you can ask questions to. eScribers, once you get to the interview and decide you want to give it a try, they give you a mentor. There is actually a lot more technical pieces to eScribers than Transcibeme from what I see so far, but I enjoy it more.\n\nI have read that with Allegis, if you are offered the phone interview you are basically in, just like eScribers, however someone else mentioned above that was not the case for them so maybe that is incorrect. I have read that you have to commit to a min. of 20 hours per week as well. Again, not confirmed just what I read. I am not sure if you have tried any of the other transcription places, but if you have not, I would definitely recommend attempting Transcribme's legal tests. Just try passing them alone will give you a significant amount of knowledge that can help you with transcribing in general. The way that they have their system set up is definitely entry level friendly. Good Luck on your interview, I'm sure you will do great, but if you do not. Don't sweat try one of these other companies!",

      "selftext": "This is going to sound weird but I need to figure out if there's actually something here or if I just stumbled into the weirdest traffic source that converts at basically nothing.\n\nStarted a site last July about restoring old photographs. Not like a service, just guides and tutorials. How to fix water damage, remove scratches, colorize black and white photos, that kind of stuff. Basic affiliate setup linking to Photoshop alternatives and scanning equipment.\n\nFirst three months nothing happened. Maybe 200 visitors total. Spent the first month targeting stuff like \"best photo editing software\" and ranking on page 7 behind every tech blog that's ever existed. Gave up on that pretty quick.\n\nAround November I started writing these posts about specific types of damage. Like \"how to restore photos with mold damage\" or \"fix photos stuck to glass frames.\" More specific, less competition. Traffic started coming in. Hit about 1,100 visitors a day by December.\n\nThen something strange happened in January.\n\nI wrote this post about restoring Victorian era photographs because I had some examples from my girlfriend's grandmother's attic. Included a bunch of photos from the 1880s and 1890s. Put the names in the image alt text because I thought that's what you're supposed to do for accessibility or whatever.\n\nPost ranked fine. Nothing special. Then I started noticing weird searches in Search Console.\n\nTook me almost a week to figure out what was happening. I kept seeing traffic for \"Margaret Whitmore 1887\" and \"James Whitmore obituary\" and \"Whitmore family tree.\" Thought maybe there was some historical figure I'd never heard of. Googled them. Nothing. Just random dead people whose photos I'd used as examples.\n\nPeople were googling their dead relatives and finding my post because I had used their names in the image descriptions.\n\nNow about 40% of my traffic is people searching for specific names of people who died between 1850 and 1920. I'm ranking for hundreds of dead people's names. Sometimes I'm position 2 or 3 above actual genealogy sites. My top keyword used to be \"remove scratches from photos.\" Now it's \"James Whitmore 1889 obituary.\" I don't even have an obituary on my site.\n\nTraffic is up to 2,800 visitors a day. But my conversion rate tanked. Went from 3.1% in December to 1.4% now. Because people aren't looking for photo restoration services, they're looking for information about their great great grandfather.\n\nRevenue is basically the same as December even though traffic doubled. Made $1,840 in December, made $1,920 in January. Affiliate clicks are down. Time on page is up from 2 minutes to almost 6 minutes but nobody's buying anything.\n\nI get emails now. Maybe 10-15 a week. People asking if I have more information about their relatives. Asking if I know where the photos came from. One person offered me $200 for a high resolution scan of a photo that was in my post. I didn't even own the photo, it was from my girlfriend's family.\n\nOne person asked if I could \"sense\" anything about their great grandmother because I had her photo on my site. Like if I could feel her presence or something. They weren't joking. Offered me $50 to \"connect\" with her. I'm a blogger, not a medium.\n\nMy girlfriend's mom found the post in January and called at 11pm. I could hear her through the phone from across the room. Something about disrespecting the dead and exploiting family history. These people died in 1883. I don't think they care about my blog. Took the photos down anyway. Traffic from those specific names dropped immediately.\n\nStarted testing this with other posts. Wrote about restoring Civil War era photos, used names from Union soldier records that are public domain. Same thing happened. Now I'm ranking for like 30 soldiers' names. Getting emails from people asking about their great great great grandfather who fought in Virginia.\n\nI have no information to give these people. I just used the photos as examples. But they keep emailing.\n\nTried monetizing this differently in February. Added a section to those posts saying \"looking for more information about your ancestor? Try [Ancestry.com](http://Ancestry.com)\" with an affiliate link. Conversion rate went up to 2.1%. Made $2,340 so far this month.\n\nBut the emails are getting more intense. Someone asked if I could help them find their grandfather's grave. Someone else asked if I had any letters or documents. One person accused me of stealing photos from their family and said they'd report me to I don't even know what. The internet police? The photos are from the Library of Congress.\n\nAll the photos I use now are public domain or from my girlfriend's family with permission. But people don't care. They see a photo of someone with their last name from 1890 and assume I have some connection to their family history.\n\nI'm spending maybe 6 hours a week just responding to emails telling people I don't have any additional information. Another 10 hours writing new posts. So I'm spending 16 hours a week total, making $2,300 a month. That's like $35 an hour before taxes. I could literally make more doing photo editing gigs on Fiverr and not deal with angry emails about dead people.\n\nAlso my girlfriend wants me to stop using any photos that could be traced to real people. Which I get. But that's literally the entire traffic source now. If I switch to generic stock photos or illustrations the traffic will die.\n\nTried writing posts about photo restoration without using specific names. Just \"Victorian era photo restoration techniques\" with example images labeled \"Unknown woman circa 1885.\" Those posts get maybe 50 visitors a month. Nobody searches for that.\n\nThe traffic only comes when I use real names of real dead people.\n\nI looked into this and apparently it's legal because they've been dead for over 100 years and everything's public domain. But legal doesn't mean it feels right. I'm basically using dead people for SEO.\n\nSome of the emails are actually nice though. People thanking me for preserving the photos. People saying they've been searching for images of their ancestor for years. One person said my post was the only photo they'd ever seen of their great grandmother. That made me feel less terrible about the whole thing.\n\nBut I can't scale this. I can't hire someone to respond to emails about dead people's family histories. I can't outsource writing posts about specific individuals because you need to actually research them to write anything meaningful.\n\nAnd I don't want to research them. I just wanted to write about photo restoration.\n\nTraffic is growing. I'm at 3,100 visitors a day now. Revenue is growing slowly. Yesterday I ranked number 1 for someone's name and got an email from their living grandson asking if I was related to them. No dude. I just have a photo of your dead grandpa on my blog.\n\nBut I'm stuck in this weird niche where I'm accidentally running a genealogy resource site when I was trying to run an affiliate site about photo editing software.\n\nI don't know if I should lean into this or try to pivot back to the original plan. Leaning in means more emails, more research, more dealing with people's emotional family stuff. Pivoting back means losing most of my traffic.\n\nAlso tried adding a FAQ to those posts saying \"I don't have additional information about individuals in these photos.\" Doesn't help. People email anyway.\n\nThe restoration work itself is easy. Photoshop for most of it. Tried making some before and after comparison videos with APOB for a few posts back in December but nobody watched them so I stopped. That's not really the problem anyway.\n\nThe problem is I built something I didn't mean to build and now I don't know what to do with it.\n\nAnyone else end up ranking for something completely random? Do you follow the traffic or just start over?",

      "selftext": "\n\nBeen looking at a lot of deal flow over the past 6-8 months and theres a pattern I keep noticing that I think is worth talking about. Not every type of online business is trending the same direction valuation-wise. Some categories are compressing, some are flat, and a few are quietly getting more expensive to acquire. I wanted to break down the three I keep seeing come up.\n\n\n\nFirst one is vertical SaaS for non-tech industries. Think software built for plumbers, dentists, property managers, small logistics companies. These industries are digitizing but they're doing it slowly and with very few options. Which means when someone builds a tool that actually works for, say, a regional plumbing company to manage scheduling and invoicing... that customer is not leaving. Ever. They're not browsing G2 on weekends looking for alternatives. They found something, it works, their admin person learned it, and thats that.\n\n\n\nI've seen vertical SaaS tools with pretty modest MRR, like $15-30k range, get competing offers because acquirers understand that the switching costs are massive and the TAM is still expanding. These industries haven't even scratched the surface of software adoption. Monthly churn on some of these is sub-2%, sometimes closer to 1.1-1.4%. Multiples are creeping up because buyers are pricing in the retention and the runway, not just current revenue.\n\n\n\nSecond category is one I find genuinely interesting. Productized services that are converting into software. So imagine a company that started doing manual SEO audits as a done-for-you service. Charging $500-800 per audit, doing maybe 40-60 a month. Then they build a tool that automates like 80% of the audit process. Now they've got proven demand (people already pay for this), improving margins because delivery is getting cheaper, and a path toward full SaaS economics.\n\n\n\nThese are fascinating from a buyer perspective because you're not guessing whether people want the thing. You already know they do. You're just watching the margin structure improve over time. I looked at one of these last year where gross margins went from 41% to 68% over 14 months just from automating parts of their fulfillment. The revenue barely changed but the business got dramatically more valuable.\n\n\n\nThird is micro-SaaS with integration or API plays. Small tools that plug into bigger ecosystems... Shopify apps, Salesforce integrations, Slack bots, tools that are Zapier-native. The thing about these is distribution is partially solved by the platform itself. You're not spending $4k/month on paid acquisition hoping your landing page converts. People find you in the app store while they're already looking for a solution.\n\n\n\nAnd once your tool is embedded in someone's workflow, the stickiness is insane. I looked at a Shopify app doing $22k MRR that had net revenue retention of like 113% because existing users kept upgrading as their stores grew. The app just grew with them. Churn was there but expansion revenue more than covered it.\n\n\n\nWhat I think is actually driving all three of these trends is the same underlying thing. Buyers are getting smarter about what \"defensible\" actually means. It's not about having a patent or some proprietary algorithm. It's about structural switching costs, embedded workflows, and expanding TAMs in categories where competition is still thin. Those three things together are what's making acquirers pay up.\n\n\n\nIf you're building in one of these categories and wondering whether the market values what you're doing... it probably does more than you think. And if you're not in one of these categories, I'm not saying your business isn't valuable, but it might be worth thinking about whether theres a way to move toward one of these dynamics. The margin structure one especially. I keep seeing sellers underestimate how much a clear trajectory matters to buyers even when the current numbers are mid.\n\n\n\nAnyway just patterns I've been noticing. Could be wrong about where things go from here but the deal data over the last year or so has been pretty consistent on this stuff.",

Your three buckets line up almost 1:1 with that.\n\nOne trick for people not in those categories: add “boring glue” around your product. Turn generic SaaS into “vertical” by baking in industry-specific workflows and integrations (QuickBooks + ServiceTitan style), or wrap a service around it and slowly automate. Even small things like building a native Shopify or HubSpot app can change your multiple.\n\nI’ve used Acquire and BitsForDigits to watch this play out, and Pulse for Reddit has been handy for catching those early “thinking of selling” or “turning this agency into SaaS” posts in niche subs.\n\nDefensibility via switching costs and margin trajectory is what’s getting rewarded right now.",

      "selftext": "Started this site last May. Writing about personal finance stuff, mostly credit cards and budgeting apps. Figured people searching for \"Card A vs Card B\" are probably ready to apply.\n\nFirst five months were dead. Like maybe 150 visitors total by September. I was writing twice a week, following all the SEO advice, but nothing was happening. Started thinking I picked the wrong niche.\n\nOctober things started moving. Traffic went from nothing to around 500 visitors a day. I was checking Google Analytics constantly. November hit 780. By December I was at 950 daily visitors and made $2,100 that month. I remember sitting at my desk just staring at the dashboard because I couldn't believe it was real.\n\nJanuary I made $2,800. Traffic was still around 950 a day, maybe 1,000 on good days. Thought okay this is it, it's going to keep growing.\n\nNow it's February and I'm still at 950 visitors. Revenue is around $2,600 this month so far. It's just stuck there. Traffic isn't growing at all.\n\nI've got 61 posts published. Still doing two per week like I have been. But new posts aren't ranking. My best post is a credit card comparison that ranks number 3 and makes about $740 a month by itself. I've written four more comparison posts trying to copy that success. None of them rank past page 2.\n\nThe posts that already rank are fine. They're not moving up but they're not dropping either. It's like I hit my ceiling.\n\nI started adding comparison tables in January. Like actual side by side breakdowns of fees and rewards. Takes longer to build but I thought it would help. Haven't seen any ranking changes yet. Maybe it's too soon, I don't know.\n\nGot an email list too. Around 620 people now. Growing maybe 25 a week. When I email about a new post I usually get a few signups. Email probably drives 10 or 15 percent of revenue but it's hard to track because people click through and apply later.\n\nConversion rate is around 1.4% which seems okay for finance. Most signups come from the comparison posts where I break down which card is better for specific situations. Takes way longer to write but people seem to trust it more.\n\nTried making some explainer videos in December. Used Canva for graphics and messed around with APOB and a couple other tools to make talking head style videos without showing my face. Made like three videos explaining credit card rewards programs. Got maybe 200 views total on YouTube. Took forever to put together so I gave up on that pretty quick.\n\nTried guest posting in January. Reached out to maybe 30 finance blogs. Got two guest posts published. Saw zero change in rankings.\n\nAlso tried Facebook ads for like two weeks in November. Spent around $240 targeting people interested in credit cards. Got maybe 160 clicks and literally zero applications. Not even one. Thought my tracking was broken but nope, just zero conversions. Stopped that immediately.\n\nTried Twitter too. Posted tips and linked to my posts for like three weeks. Got maybe 80 followers and like 20 clicks total. Waste of time.\n\nI post on Reddit sometimes in personal finance subs when I can actually help without being promotional. Drives maybe 100 visitors a month but most of them bounce anyway.\n\nUsing Ahrefs for keywords. $99 a month which sucks.\n\nWhat's frustrating is I don't know what changed. Traffic was growing every month from October to December. Then it stopped. I'm doing the same stuff. Same quality, same keywords, same everything.\n\nAlso seeing bigger sites like NerdWallet and The Points Guy covering the same cards I write about. They have way more authority so I'm probably screwed competing with them. Trying to find more specific angles like \"best credit cards for small business owners under 30\" but those get barely any searches.\n\nSpending maybe 18 hours a week on this. Writing takes forever when you have to research all the terms and conditions.\n\nTraffic is flat. Revenue is basically flat. New posts aren't ranking.\n\nDid Google change something in December or January? I keep seeing people talk about algorithm updates but I can't tell if I got hit.\n\nAnyone else stuck like this? I keep going back and forth on whether I should just keep doing what I'm doing or try something completely different. But I don't even know what different would look like. Like should I stop writing new posts and just update the ones that already rank? Should I try to get more backlinks even though guest posting didn't work? Should I just wait it out?\n\nI don't know. Some days I think I just need to be patient. Other days I think I'm wasting my time.",

Content pillars around credit itself, the factors in it, how to build credit, what is a good mix of credit cards, etc. might help. \n\nI think if Google looks at your site and thinks you’re only producing content to earn commissions, you’ll be pushed less. Are you an expert in the field? If so, do you have an about page listing your credentials, methodology, etc?

All the online marketing “coaches”, all of the 1M MRR from 5 clients and etc.\n\nI was sitting on Reddit the other day and read a post about an e-com influencer being caught faking his sales and having an open collaboration with the platform that lets you fake the results. A peanut for a brain basically.\n\nBut I decided to do some research myself since I had too much free time that day, I investigated all of the brez scale of the industry, basically the biggest influencers and all of the go-to coaches for digital marketing.\n\nGuess what.\n\nI noticed the same thing, one of the best known “coaches” within the space who constantly flexes his “Yellow Ferrari” (which by now I think is rented) forgot to remove a “,” when faking his stripe numbers. You can connect the dots yourself on who it is.\n\nI thought to myself this couldn’t be real, I sent the video to multiple friends, they all saw the same thing.\n\nMessaged the guy, asked to join his course, the usual. Then once the call link got sent, I sent him the screenshot.\n\nHis reply was the same, he said the dashboard wasn’t real but it helped him push out more content. He sent me the platform and a discount code for it as an affiliate partnership reference. The platform is extremely polished and you genuinely couldn’t tell the original from the fake apart if you didn’t make any typo’s. (Yes, I bought the dashboard for research purposes ONLY)\n\nI thought to myself “No shit, they’re all faking it”.\n\nThe internet, especially the digital marketing coaching scene, is full of fakes. There’s even tools helping them do it to lure you into the “get rich quick online” scene.\n\nI’m not saying every coach is fake, but please for the love of God, do your own due-diligence prior to falling to the guy with the rented lambo and the rented penthouse.\n\n  \nQuick Edit; I'm not sure why so many of you are dm'ing me about it.

      "selftext": "Cold calling isn't dead. Bad cold calling is dead. I tracked every call this month and the data tells a clear story.\n\nOut of 820 dials, I got 124 connects which is about 16 percent connect rate. Of those connects, 32 turned into real conversations over 3 minutes. And 12 of those became booked meetings.\n\nThe math breaks down to roughly 72 calls per meeting. Not amazing, but profitable when your deal size is right.\n\nHere's what I learned about openers this month. I tested three different approaches across roughly equal call volumes. The pattern interrupt opener where I said something unexpected like \"Hey this is a cold call, you can hang up but give me 18 seconds first\" got 30 percent to stay on the line past 30 seconds. The permission-based opener where I asked \"Did I catch you at a bad time\" got 22 percent. The direct pitch where I immediately explained why I was calling got only 14 percent.\n\nThe pattern interrupt felt awkward at first but the data was clear. People appreciate honesty about what's happening.\n\nOn timing, I found that Tuesday through Thursday between 10 AM and 11:30 AM had the highest connect rates at 19 percent. Monday mornings were brutal at 9 percent. Friday afternoons were dead at 5 percent. I stopped calling Fridays after lunch entirely.\n\nThe biggest insight was about follow-up after missed calls. I left 310 voicemails. Got 7 callbacks. That's barely 1 percent. But when I stopped leaving voicemails and instead sent a quick LinkedIn message within 5 minutes of the missed call, I got 22 responses from 156 attempts. That's 14 percent. The multi-touch approach crushed voicemail-only.\n\nMy current approach is to call, if no answer send immediate LinkedIn connection with a note referencing the call, then follow up with email the next day. This three-channel approach within 24 hours gets way better results than any single channel alone.\n\nThe psychology behind why this works is simple. People are busy. They miss calls all the time. But when they see the same person tried to reach them through multiple channels, it signals importance. It also creates familiarity. By the time they see your email, they've already seen your name twice.\n\nThe reps on my team who adopted this approach saw their meeting rates increase by 37 percent within the first month. The ones who stuck to single-channel calling stayed flat.\n\nCold calling works but it's not about the call anymore. It's about how the call fits into a larger sequence. The phone is the start of the conversation, not the whole thing.\n\nIf you're still measuring success by calls made, you're missing the point. Measure conversations started across all channels. That's what actually predicts revenue.",

The woman got straight to the point. It came as a little shock at first but she asked me 2 or 3 simple questions and I answered. I didn’t need the product and the last question was, am I interested. I said no and she hung up with a simple goodbye. After the call, I was convinced it was a bot. I also realised it didn’t annoy me like a sales call usually does but that might have been due to the fact that it was new and surprised me. I’m sure getting 10 of these calls a day would be annoying. I need to make cold calls for my business and I avoid it like the plague. I know it’s the game but when I know how much it annoys me, I can’t do it to others. I think I might have to look more into the AI bot thing for my own business.",

But even now, cold calls arent highly effective (as tracked close rate percentages always demonstrate) and they will never not be abrasive. I think they key to using calls to generate business requires a clever and effective sales/marketing hybrid approach that qualifies leads and generates consultative, warm-calls. The more of these your firm generates, the more calls your sales team can make. More criticaly, instead of knowing nothing about them, salespeople can act as a guide (and a catalyst) towards finding solutions your firm offers that help with your prospect's challenges. \n\nThe corporate avg is typically stated that around 5% of cold calls generate revenue (or so my last couple employers used to state) Thus, old school mentality was to get your sales to call, call, call!! To me, that just meant 95% of my time (and later, my team's time) was inefficiently spent. Later, as VP of Sales, I arranged to regularly collaborate with marketing and product to ensure our solutions were getting in front of the right eyes, the product regularly evolved to meet or exceed expectations and our sales team was then getting warm leads to follow up as helpful consultants and not high-pressure closers. Getting the process to a place where it became truly effective took time (about 6mo) with much back and forth. Along the way we discovered roadblocks in all areas, marketing, sales and product which we then tweaked and refined. Ultimately we grew flat sales to +35% (Year 1) and +45% (year 2). \n\nCold calling is a blunt-force approach and DOES have its place in the very early days but, this should rather quickly be evolved around a more strategic business plan to capture new customers and revenue. \n\n",

The multi-channel follow-up is key, I've seen the same patttern w/ B2B outreach.  \n\nOne thing I'd add is that the opener matters way less than people think.  What actually matters is who you're calling.  I've found that calling the right person (owner, decision maker) with a mediocre opener beats calling the wrong person with a perfect opener every time.\n\nThe pattern interrupt works because it's honest.  People respect that.  But honestly, if you're calling a gym owner who books online and you lead with \"I can help you get more customers through Google,\" they're listening regardless of your opener.   \n\nThe LinkedIn follow-up thing, though, that's the real win.  It's not about the call anymore; it's about being persistent without being annoying.  Seeing your name twice in 5 minutes signals you're serious.  \n\n",

Most of these companies are run by skilled tradespeople who are great at the work but terrible at consistent follow-up. The ones who figure out predictable lead flow scale fast because the bottleneck is almost never the service quality, it's the pipeline.\n\nCurious about your tech stack for this. Are you running SMS campaigns through something like Twilio or using a platform, and are you building the automation yourself or using off-the-shelf tools? The margin difference between those two approaches is massive at scale.\n\nAlso, one thing I've seen work well for local service lead gen: once you nail the playbook for one vertical (say pressure washing), the same system usually transfers to adjacent verticals with minimal tweaking. Landscaping, HVAC, roofing. The outreach mechanics are nearly identical, just different keywords and seasonal patterns. That's where the real compounding happens.",

But as you look to grow, you need to move from being the 'Motor' to being the 'Architect.'\n\nUsing the Curling analogy: right now, you are throwing the stone and sweeping the ice with everything you have. To reach the next level, you need to build a Structure (systems and lead-gen flows) that works even when you take a breath. You’ve proven you can survive; now it’s time to prove you can build a legacy that doesn't depend solely on your daily adrenaline.\n\nKeep building with that same 'stubborn hope.' The world needs more founders who have real scars.\n\nNow that you’ve mastered the 'hustle,' what is the first system you are building to ensure this business remains a source of freedom rather than a new type of cage?",

You may get some quick wins, but don't be lulled into thinking that's every day. \n2. Surround yourself with people smarter than yourself.  It's the smartest thing you can do. \n3. Practice self-care. Entrepreneurship requires every bit of you. Every single day. (And most nights.) Exercise. Eat well. Meditate. Rest. The basics. But you have to do them better, than most other people, just to keep moving forward. Do not underestimate this. \n\nP.S. I did spend a few years working for other companies. But they simply taught me what I did not want to do. \n\nWhat would you add to this list?\n\n \n\n ",

I burned out twice before I finally got it.\n\nI'd add a fourth that took me way too long to learn: Build systems, not just hustle. Early on I thought grinding harder was always the answer. But the businesses that actually scaled were the ones where I stepped back and asked \"how can I make this repeatable without me?\"\n\nDocumenting processes felt like a waste of time when I was busy. But once I had systems in place, I could delegate, I could take a real vacation, and honestly the business ran better without me micromanaging every detail.\n\nThe other thing I'd add: Get comfortable with saying no. Every opportunity looks good when you're hungry. But chasing every shiny object dilutes your focus and burns your energy. Learning to say \"that's interesting but it's not aligned with where I'm going\" was a game changer.\n\nCurious what your thoughts are on delegation vs doing it yourself.

Nobody posts \"day 47, still zero paying users, ate cereal for dinner.\"\n\nSomething that helped me reframe it: those people posting 10k MRR didn't get there by scrolling Reddit and comparing themselves to other people posting 10k MRR. They got there by closing the app and doing one uncomfortable thing per day. One cold email, one user interview, one feature shipped.\n\nAlso worth remembering that \"first few paying users\" is genuinely the hardest milestone in any business. Going from 0 to 1 is harder than going from 100 to 1000.

      "selftext": "We're a small software dev shop (4 people, veteran-owned SDVOSB) that builds custom software for government and enterprise clients. We've closed over $1M in contracts in roughly 2 years. The average deal is around $100K, and the lifetime client value sits around $350K as they re-up.\n\nHere's the thing: almost all of that came from me and my network. Every time we've tried to bring on a salaried salesperson, it's been the same story. Pay them for months, they don't close anything, and we're out a chunk of cash we could've reinvested into the business. It's happened multiple times now, and honestly, it's one of the most frustrating parts of scaling.\n\nSo we shifted our thinking. We put together what I think is a solid commission structure:\n\n* 10% on the initial downpayment\n* 5% on all recurring revenue from their clients\n* 30% of anything sold above our base proposal (so if we quote $100K and they close at $130K, they keep 30% of that $30K)\n\nWe'd also cover conference tickets and events since that's a big part of how deals happen in this space.\n\nOn a typical deal, that's around $10K upfront with recurring income over the client's lifetime. Not bad for someone who knows how to sell and doesn't need their hand held.\n\nBut I genuinely cannot figure out where to find people who are actually good at sales AND willing to work commission. Every platform I've tried is either flooded with people who want a base salary no matter what, or with people who talk a big game but don't deliver.\n\nFor those of you who've been in a similar spot, where did you actually find your salespeople? Did commission only work for you, or did you just bite the bullet and keep paying salaries until someone stuck? Also open to hearing if my comp structure is off, always willing to adjust.\n\nAppreciate any insight. This is the one piece of the puzzle I haven't figured out yet.",

          "body": "We're a similar size dev shop and went through the exact same cycle. Hired two salespeople over a year and a half, neither closed a single deal. The problem is that selling custom software is fundamentally different from selling a product. Your prospects need someone who can talk architecture, understand scope, and build trust around technical competence. A traditional salesperson can't do that.\n\nWhat worked for us was treating sales as a partnership function, not a hire. We found two channel partners (an agency and a consulting firm) who already had relationships with the types of clients we serve. They bring us into conversations when a client needs custom dev work, and we give them a referral cut. No salary risk, no ramp-up time, and the leads come pre-qualified because the partner already has trust.\n\nYour commission structure looks reasonable, but I'd add one thing: make sure whoever you bring on has genuine technical literacy. They don't need to code, but they need to understand enough to have a credible conversation about what you build and why it matters. That's the filter most dev shops miss.",

They see what they get in their MVP and their roadmap. You would essentially do a version of this when they sign up anyway but by doing it as a separate product there’s a low cost and low friction step that provides real value. Technically they can shop the doc to get quotes on the build but no one ever did because the relationship is built and they’re already in motion (especially now days when you have a tool like Figma make that can punch out a prototype in a few minutes and include mock UIs in the workshop doc 🤯). For sales people their close rate went up exponentially because they weren’t selling $100k build which will normally need several people to sign off on instead they were selling a $5-$10k workshop which usually only needs one person to sign off on.

          "body": "The reason you keep losing money on salaried salespeople is that government/enterprise software sales has a long cycle and a very specific skillset. Most salespeople who apply to small shops are used to selling something with a shorter close and an established brand behind them. They flounder when they have to open doors from scratch in a niche like SDVOSB contracting.\n\n  \nYour commission structure is actually solid for someone who understands the space. The problem is where you are looking. A few things that have worked for other small shops in similar positions:\n\n  \n1. Look for retired or semi-retired government contracting officers or program managers. These people have the rolodex and understand procurement, but they are done with full-time work. Commission-only or part-time with commission is perfect for them. Try AFCEA chapter events, local GovCon meetups, and LinkedIn groups specifically for SDVOSB/8a contractors.\n\n  \n2. Partner with other small SDVOSB shops that do complementary work (cybersecurity, cloud infra, data analytics). You refer them your overflow, they refer you theirs. No salesperson needed for those deals, just relationship management.\n\n  \n3. If you want a dedicated seller, consider a hybrid: small base (even $2-3K/month) plus your commission structure. The base signals that you are serious and filters out the dreamers. The good ones will earn way more from commission anyway. $2-3K/month is cheap insurance against another wasted hire.\n\n  \n4. Your $100K average deal with $350K LTV is a strong story. Lead with that when recruiting. A salesperson closing even 3 deals a year at your structure would earn $30K+ in commissions plus recurring. Make sure your pitch to salespeople is as polished as your pitch to clients.\n\n  \nThe uncomfortable truth is that pure commission-only is a red flag for top sales talent because they have options. The people willing to work 100% commission with no base tend to be either very confident or very desperate, and the ratio skews toward the latter.",

They are rare, but they are there. In a world where a good sales person works the same job for 5-10 years and bad sales people work a job for 5-10 months and in a world where there are 10 times as many good sales people as bad sales people the number of good sales people looking for work is 12 X 10 = 120 times greater than the number of bad sales people looking for a job.\n\nYou need to look for those diamonds in the rough to get a good sales person.\n\nYou then also need to train them on your product. Set up a marketing funnel for them to give them a constant stream of business, etc.\n\nSome people hire a bunch of young, hungry, commission only sales people - fire 90% of them in 6 months because they aren't even worth the time being spent on developing them and build their sales force that way. But you really need to be able to develop sales people in order to be able to do that. Our model has been to hire a bunch of young hungry technical people, start them on technical projects, and develop them, over time, to start to work with clients and write deal proposals, with a lot of supervision at first.",

The buyer is not purchasing a product - they are buying confidence that your team can actually deliver. That kind of trust transfer takes years to build, not months.\n\nThe commission-only or hybrid model is the right direction, but the pool of people who can sell $100K+ technical services AND are willing to work on commission is extremely small. The good ones already have established books of business and are not browsing job boards.\n\nWhat has worked for similar shops I know: instead of hiring salespeople, they turned their existing team into a sales channel. Engineers writing about their work, speaking at conferences, being active in communities where government procurement people and CTOs hang out. Slower but the close rate is dramatically higher because the buyer is talking to the person who will actually build their system.\n\nThe SDVOSB advantage is also worth leaning into harder. There are procurement officers who actively need to fill set-aside quotas. Building direct relationships with those specific people is often more productive than any cold outreach campaign.",

But we don’t run ads / have a fixed price list / etc etc so it was difficult for the sales person to articulate.\n\n3. They didn’t know very much about the service that we offered and so couldn’t really understand the need for it. That made them fail when it came to explaining basic concepts.\n\nEven at 1M a year we’re not big enough for that. I’m closing business now and doing a good job.

I suspect you’re probably in a position where nearly all the company needs to be 100% billable. I bet you are also likely billable, too. Not knowing a whole lot about your employee base it could make a lot sense to make a strategic hire. One who can bill 70-80% and help you sell at the same time. You will pay a premium for someone who can do both, but at 70-80 billable, they are probably still covered. These people do exist. You didn’t mention anything about your BD strategy. This is a place where a lot of services firms at your size struggle.",

We burned money on sales and marketing employees. We burned money on agencies. We burned money on paid ads. Tried everything to make that type of business scale.\n\nHere's the truth:\nYou are trying to solve an equation that has no solution. Look at all the answers here. Everybody is desperately trying to get a steady stream of customers running. \n\nFrom what I have seen and learned in the past 10 years, I would say it's not possible to come up with any sales or marketing strategy or tactics that generate new customers. \nSure, having a good partner company can work. But it will make you dependant and often, you will be the sub contractor in the back.\n\nHere's what does work. It worked for us and I know plenty of companies where it worked too:\n\nYou need to fix your OFFER. \nYou can't just offer sw development as a service. Nobody cares, really. It provides questionable results, it is risky, it takes forever, it is never the primary solution for any given problem but often the most expensive one and if you fail, it can seriously damage the decision makers career. \n\n\"But I want to offer custom dev\"\nYes. It is absolutely possible to do so.\nBut you need to separate FULFILMENT from your VALUE PROPOSITION.\n\nSee, your customers will buy the following offer:\n\"We help (industry) to achieve (transformation) in (time span), as proven by (case study A, case study B).\"\n\nE.g. \"We help medical device manufacturers cut time to market by 30% by introducing a custom PLM solution based on ... as end-to-end backbone in 3-6 months\"\n\nThat's an actual example of a biz doing very well. \nIt is still 80% custom development in the background. But the value proposition and the target audience is crystal clear.\n\nAnd abacadabra, sales and marketing suddenly do work.\nAnd it gets even easier to find new customers using partners and referrals. \n\nHow to shift from generic dev shop to such a business? I figured this out the hard way and I could write books about it. If people are interested, I can write some more information about it in another post.",

This is completely normal and it's actually a sign you need to make your next hire an operations person, not another revenue-generating role.\n\nWe went through the same transition. The instinct is to keep hiring people who do the core work, but what actually unlocks your time is hiring someone whose entire job is managing the people stuff. Scheduling, time off, shift coverage, onboarding. All of it.\n\nThe math is simple: if you're spending 15-20 hours a week on employee management instead of growth activities, an ops manager at 50-60K pays for themselves almost immediately through the revenue you can now generate with that recovered time.\n\nShort term fix while you hire: give your most reliable employee at each location scheduling authority. They handle swaps and coverage, you only get involved for exceptions. It won't solve everything but it buys you back a few hours a week.",

I firgured they needed accountability. So, I had them send daily 5 minute report of what they were working, what’s their focus for the day, and what were they stuck or off track. Plus I needed them to start organizing their shifts themselves.\n\nThe second thing was that I end up hiring a remote virtual assistant in Latam through a company that GPT recommended. This staffing agency was called Hire With Near. It was game changing. Yep it cost me a bit at first but it was totally worth it. Instead of spending 60-70k having someone on-site or remote in the US this VA from Mexico was around ~20k a year.  But beyond saving time an each week I had most of the admin stuff handled.

Not fancy stuff, just the boring admin work that eats your day. Those two combined probably 3xd my actual productive output.",

Put yourself around founders doing bigger numbers. Attend events. Join paid communities. Work with higher level clients. Travel while still running your business. You do not need a campus to expand your thinking. And those travel build programs can be interesting, but only if they genuinely raise your standards and connect you with serious operators.

That's a more honest self-assessment than most people twice your age ever make.\n\nHere's what I'd sit with. The question isn't \"college or no college.\" It's \"what kind of growth do I need right now?\" You've proven you can execute. You can build, sell, deliver. That's real and you should be proud of it. But execution without perspective narrows over time. You get better and better at the thing you already know, and your world gets smaller while your revenue gets bigger. That's a trap disguised as progress.\n\nCollege, at its best, isn't about learning business theory. It's about being forced to think across disciplines you would never choose on your own. Philosophy, history, psychology, ethics. The stuff that doesn't feel useful until ten years later when you're making decisions that require more than tactical skill. It broadens the foundation you build everything else on.\n\nThat said, a traditional four-year degree isn't the only way to get that. Those travel programs you mentioned sound closer to what you actually need: real exposure, real building, real worldview expansion. The test for any option isn't \"will this give me a credential.\" It's \"will this make me think differently about what I'm already doing.\"\n\nYou don't need a backup plan. You need a wider lens. How you get it matters less than whether you're honest about needing it. And at 19, the fact that you already see that puts you ahead of where most people start",

You can always take online classes to work towards a degree if they becomes necessary, and some colleges will give you credits for your business experience to shorten the time and classes required.\n\nYou can always sell your business to cash out and take time off to get a degree if you wish, but I think you will want to see how far you can go with your agency over the coming 5+ years as who knows how far it can grow.\n\nOnce you do get to a level of financial success you can travel the world however you wish. Also, look into organizations like Rotary, Kiwanis, or some other local groups where business owners meet. I travelled to conferences held for owners and principals in the business I owned, and it was great to connect and network with others doing what I as doing, so look for those opportunities. \n\nOne tip is to start putting money away early and save as much as you can. This will help give you breathing room if the business can't be sold or goes through a downturn. ",

And the mom of the lead singer girl made her go to college,  first, and then revisit her music career. They *never* got back to where they were before she dropped it to go to college. \n\nI think my point is, if you're building, and it is still in the early stages, see if you can get that degree now. And go for one that actually helps you with your business/niche. \nIf you've done a lot of building, and it has (starter to) really take off, don't just drop your business.  \n\nAnd there's lots of space between 'dropping the business and going 100% for the degree' and 'focusing 100% in your business and NOT getting a degree at all'.",

      "selftext": "To put it short - stop believing everything you see on the internet.\n\nLately it feels like every other reel on Instagram is some guy screen-recording a “live” Shopify or Stripe dashboard selling a course. Same angle. Same cursor hovering over revenue. Same refresh button. Same captions about quitting your job.\n\nOne in particular kept popping up on my feed. Young guy, rented Airbnb background, MacBook on the table, showing what looked like steady five-figure days. I wasn’t even mad about it. I’ve been in dropshipping long enough to know big days happen.\n\nI probably wouldn’t have thought twice about it if I hadn’t paused the video at the wrong time.\n\nWhen he refreshed the dashboard, the numbers updated and for a split second there were two dollar signs in front of the revenue. Most likely a typo. One slightly offset. It disappeared almost immediately when the animation finished. You wouldn’t notice it unless you scrubbed through the video frame by frame.\n\nSo I did.\n\nI replayed it a few times and it kept happening. The extra symbol showed up for a fraction of a second and then corrected itself. It didn’t look like lag.\n\nInstead of commenting publicly, I DMed him. Acted interested. Asked about the course, the usual questions. He replied quickly, sent voice notes, told me spots were filling up, as every guru does i guess.\n\nAfter a few messages, I sent him a screenshot from his own reel with the duplicate dollar sign circled and just asked what that was.\n\nHe responded saying they had a collaboration with a platform that lets them simulate dashboards for marketing. Said it helps make content cleaner and even sent a signup link to the same platform he was FAKING it all on. Said the real business is separate from what’s shown in videos.\n\nJust so you understand the size of this problem - there's probs way more affiliates, way more gurus who are selling you courses that don't even know how to do the thing they're selling.\n\nI know how bad it sometimes feels when your sales are slow and then you see a 19 year old kid flexing lambos and multi-million revenue on Instagram. I'm asking you to stop believing it.\n\nNow whenever I see those “flexing” videos, I can't help myself but to analyse every single detail of the video lol.\n\nEDIT: My DM's are being flooded by people asking what the tool name is. I do not condone this and for those who are asking in regards to \"research purposes\" the tool is is dashmock or mockdash, I can't quite recall due to archiving the conversation with the influencer and I am not affiliated with it in any shape or form.",

It’s the obsession with looking successful to trigger other people's FOMO, rather than building a business that actually generates cash. When a guru tells you that 'simulating dashboards helps make content cleaner,' they are admitting that their business isn't sales, it’s illusion.\n\nUsing my **Curling analogy**: these guys are trying to convince you that they’ve thrown a perfect stone by photoshop-ing the target. But in the real world, the ice is cold and the friction is real. If you don't have a **Structure** that handles real customer data, real logistics, and real margins, you don't have a startup; you have a video edit.\n\nReal entrepreneurs don't flaunt dashboards; they obsess over **Operational Validation**.

I'd probably start with cold email outreach for B2B companies since the demand is insane and you can charge $2-5k/month per client pretty fast. Something I'm building called Brew actually came from this exact problem - spending way too much time crafting emails when I should've been focusing on strategy and client results.

          "body": "If I had to restart in 2026 with no money and no network, I wouldn’t touch SaaS or some fancy AI tool first. I’d go straight for cash flow. Service first, ego later. Something boring that solves a real problem and people already pay for. Local lead gen, short form content for businesses, email marketing for small ecom brands, that kind of thing. You do not need capital for that, just skill and relentless outreach.\n\nEveryone wants leverage before they’ve earned it. Leverage comes after you can consistently sell. So step one would be learn how to sell. Cold outreach, follow ups, handling objections, closing on Zoom. It’s uncomfortable but that’s where the money is. You can make 3k to 5k per month way faster with a service than trying to build the next big SaaS from zero. I’ve seen people burn 12 months building something nobody asked for. Painful.\n\nThen once cash flow is stable, I’d build distribution. Newsletter, Twitter, maybe YouTube. Not for ego, but to own attention. Attention compounds. You post consistently for a year and suddenly doors open. Weird how that works. It’s boring at first. Feels like shouting into the void. But that’s the tax.\n\nSo yeah. Service for cash. Sales skill for survival. Distribution for leverage. Then product later when you actually understand the market.\n\nIf you’re into building real wealth from zero and not just dreaming about it, I write about that journey weekly in Wealth Rewired. It’s all practical stuff, no guru nonsense.",

Actually talking to 50 people who run small businesses or SaaS companies and asking \"what is the most painful repetitive thing you do every week?\"\n\nThe answer in 2026 almost certainly involves AI automation. But not the way most people think. It is not \"build another AI wrapper.\" It is \"find a 500 dollar per month manual process and automate 80 percent of it with existing AI tools.\" Sell that as a service before you build a product.\n\nBiggest advantage of starting from zero in 2026 vs 2020: the cost to build has dropped 10x. A SaaS that took 50k and 6 months can now ship for under 500 dollars in a few weeks. But that also means competition is brutal, so distribution matters more than ever.\n\nFastest path: skill leads to income leads to problem discovery leads to service leads to productize.

      "selftext": "Solo founder here. Built a PDF editor over the past year. Just hit 10k downloads with zero marketing spend.\n\n\n\nNot a unicorn story - making \\~$500/month - but wanted to share what actually worked vs what I thought would work.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nTHE PRODUCT\n\n\n\nPDF editor that's:\n\n\\- 20MB (vs Adobe's 300MB)\n\n\\- Works completely offline\n\n\\- No signup/cloud required\n\n\\- Free on desktop, small one-time payment on mobile\n\n\n\nBuilt it because I was tired of bloated PDF tools that force everything through the cloud.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT I THOUGHT WOULD WORK (Spoiler: Didn't)\n\n\n\nProduct Hunt Launch: Ranked #284\n\n\\- Spent 2 weeks preparing\n\n\\- Got 50 upvotes\n\n\\- \\~200 visits\n\n\\- 12 downloads\n\n\\- Felt like a complete failure\n\n\n\nHackerNews (First Attempt): 11 points, 0 comments\n\n\\- Posted at wrong time\n\n\\- Didn't engage in comments fast enough\n\n\\- Buried in /new within an hour\n\n\n\nMy Own X/Twitter: 3-4 likes per post\n\n\\- Tweeted about launches\n\n\\- Crickets\n\n\\- My followers don't care about my product (harsh truth)\n\n\n\nPaid Ads: Didn't even try\n\n\\- No budget as bootstrapped founder\n\n\\- Heard horror stories about burning money\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT ACTUALLY WORKED\n\n\n\n1. SOMEONE ELSE'S TWEET (1,900 likes)\n\n\n\nA random user tweeted about my product. I had nothing to do with it.\n\n\n\nMy tweets: 4 likes\n\nRandom user's tweet: 1,900 likes\n\n\n\nSame product. Different messenger.\n\n\n\nLesson: You can't make your product go viral. But you can make a product so good that others want to share it.\n\n\n\n2. GERMAN TECH BLOG (3,500 downloads)\n\n\n\nA respected German tech blog found my product organically and wrote about it.\n\n\n\nI didn't pitch them. They found it.\n\n\n\nTheir angle: \"No cloud requirement\"\n\n\n\nTurns out, Germans are extremely privacy-conscious (GDPR is a mindset, not just compliance).\n\n\n\nResult: Traffic exploded overnight. 40% of my users are now from Germany, Austria, Switzerland.\n\n\n\nLesson: Build with strong principles. The right market will find you - even if it's across the world and you didn't target them.\n\n\n\n3. SOFTWARE DIRECTORIES (\\~1,000 downloads)\n\n\n\nGot listed on:\n\n\\- AlternativeTo\n\n\\- Softonic\n\n\\- AppBrain\n\n\n\nDidn't pay for featured placement. Users added my product themselves.\n\n\n\nWhen people search \"Adobe alternative\" or \"lightweight PDF editor\" - they find these directories first, not my website.\n\n\n\nResult: Steady stream of 50-100 downloads per day just from directories.\n\n\n\nLesson: SEO isn't just Google. Be discoverable where your users are searching.\n\n\n\n4. REDDIT (Organic Comments) (\\~2,200 downloads)\n\n\n\nNot posting \"Check out my product!\"\n\n\n\nJust being helpful in r/productivity, r/software threads where people ask \"What PDF editor do you use?\"\n\n\n\nI'd share my experience, mention alternatives including mine, and let them decide.\n\n\n\nResult: People checked it out because I was helpful first, promotional never.\n\n\n\nLesson: Distribution = being present where your users have problems. Not announcing where you want attention.\n\n\n\n5. WORD OF MOUTH (\\~1,000 downloads)\n\n\n\nThe unsexy one that compounds:\n\n\\- Students sharing in college WhatsApp groups\n\n\\- People recommending in forums\n\n\\- Reviews mentioning it\n\n\n\nTakes time but becomes self-sustaining.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nTHE PATTERN I'M SEEING\n\n\n\nDistribution channels I can't control (others' tweets, blogs finding me, directories, word of mouth) &gt;&gt;&gt; channels I can control (my tweets, paid ads, official launches).\n\n\n\nYou can't force organic growth. But solve a real problem well, and people will talk about it.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nCURRENT METRICS (Full Transparency)\n\n\n\nRevenue: \\~$500/month (\\~50 paid users at $10 one-time purchase)\n\nDownloads: 10,000+ total (across all platforms)\n\nTime to build: \\~10 months (nights/weekends while working day job)\n\nMarketing spend: $0\n\nTeam: Just me\n\nFunding: $0 (bootstrapped)\n\n\n\nGeographic breakdown:\n\n\\- 40% Germany/Austria/Switzerland (DACH region)\n\n\\- 35% India\n\n\\- 15% USA\n\n\\- 10% Rest of world\n\n\n\nPlatform breakdown:\n\n\\- 60% Desktop (Windows/Mac/Linux) - completely free\n\n\\- 40% Mobile (iOS/Android) - freemium\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT I'M LEARNING\n\n\n\n1. PRODUCT-MARKET FIT &gt; MARKETING\n\n\n\nUsers market products that solve real problems. You don't need to.\n\n\n\n2. GEOGRAPHIC ARBITRAGE IS REAL\n\n\n\nBiggest market: Germany\n\nMy location: Not Germany\n\nMy German language skills: Zero\n\n\n\nBuilt for global market with strong principles (privacy, offline-first). Germans loved it. Now I'm learning German and translating the app.\n\n\n\nSometimes your product finds its market before you do.\n\n\n\n3. FREEMIUM CAN WORK FOR BOOTSTRAPPED\n\n\n\n10,000 free users = my marketing team\n\n50 paid users = fund development\n\n\n\nFew % conversion isn't impressive, but:\n\n\\- Free users create reviews, mentions, directories\n\n\\- Word of mouth scales\n\n\\- Paid users make it sustainable\n\n\n\nCurrently at $500/month. Goal: $10k/month (need 1,000 paid users).\n\n\n\n4. LAUNCH DAY DOESN'T MATTER\n\n\n\nProduct Hunt flopped. Nobody remembers.\n\nHackerNews flopped. Nobody cares.\n\n\n\n3 months later: 10,000 downloads from sources I didn't plan for.\n\n\n\nGreat products compound. Bad launches don't matter if you keep shipping.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nCHALLENGES I'M FACING\n\n\n\n1. CODE SIGNING ($400/year)\n\n\n\nWindows installer isn't signed. Shows scary warning. Losing downloads because of this.\n\n\n\nCan't afford it yet at $500/month.\n\n\n\n2. CUSTOMER SUPPORT (Just Me)\n\n\n\nHandling 20+ support emails per week alone.\n\n\n\nNeed to automate or hire but can't afford yet.\n\n\n\n3. FEATURE CREEP\n\n\n\nEveryone wants their specific use case: OCR, cloud sync, collaboration.\n\n\n\nStaying focused on \"lightweight offline PDF editor\" is hard when revenue is slow.\n\n\n\n4. IMPOSTOR SYNDROME\n\n\n\n$500/month isn't impressive. Seeing others with $50k+ MRR makes me feel like I'm failing.\n\n\n\nBut have to remember: I started at $0. Progress is progress.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\n\n\nShort term:\n\n\\- Hit $3k/month (need 300 paid users)\n\n\\- Afford code signing certificate\n\n\\- Translate to German (my biggest market)\n\n\n\nLong term:\n\n\\- $10k/month = quit day job\n\n\\- Hire part-time support\n\n\\- Build team of 2-3\n\n\n\nNot trying to be a unicorn. Just trying to build a sustainable business solving a real problem.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nQUESTIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY\n\n\n\n1. How did you find your unexpected market? (Like my Germany discovery)\n\n\n\n2. At what revenue did you quit your day job? (Thinking about this at $3k/month)\n\n\n\n3. Code signing / legal costs - when do you bite the bullet and just pay?\n\n\n\n4. How do you stay motivated when growth is slow but steady?\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about:\n\n\\- Bootstrapping without funding\n\n\\- Building solo\n\n\\- Distribution tactics that worked (and failed)\n\n\\- Pricing strategy\n\n\\- Geographic expansion\n\n\\- Dealing with impostor syndrome\n\n\n\nNot here to sell - genuinely want to learn from this community. You all have been through this before.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading.",

Without code signing, business will not touch your product (they will have policies that would block it). \n\nI would do 3 things right now\n\n1) Code signing - bite the bullet and wear the costs, you are leaving money on the table without it.  \n2) Create excellent documentation, make it easy to find (in app) and search - ie work to keep support emails to a minimum.  \n3) Segment the market - $10 for private, at least $50 for business (they can afford it, and you need to cover your extra overheads).  \n\nJust be prepared for a lot of extra work selling to business - whilst some people can use their credit cards, get ready for dealing with requests for quotes and  purchase orders for $50 which can really suck up your free time (and your will to live).  \n\nGood luck.",

          "body": "The 20MB vs 300MB comparison is doing a lot of heavy lifting here and I love it. That's a genuine product advantage, not a gimmick. One thing I'd add from my experience shipping MVPs for clients: the 'zero marketing spend' framing undersells what you actually did. Community engagement, word of mouth, and showing up in forums IS marketing. It's just not paid marketing. The distinction matters because founders read 'zero budget' and think distribution happens by itself. It doesn't. You clearly put in the work on distribution, just not through ads. That's worth calling out.",

Also working on a desktop app solo and the part about Product Hunt ranking #284 made me laugh because I've been treating PH in my head like it's going to be this big moment. Sounds like it really wasn't for you.\n\nThe niche community thing tracks with what I keep seeing too. The founders who do well seem to find the 2-3 places where people already have the problem, not blast it out to everyone.\n\nQuestion though - at $10 one-time, how are you thinking about the long term math on this? u/finalbuilder brought up the support load thing and that's something I keep going back and forth on. I'm still trying to decide between one-time and subscription for my own app. At $10 per user you'd need a LOT of volume to make it work no?",

Instead of a revenue number, consider: 6 months of runway + consistent growth trend. $3k/month sounds low, but if you're seeing 20%+ month-over-month growth, the math changes fast.\n\nAlso, the code signing issue - that's costing you more than $400/year in lost conversions.

Ask upfront: \"Is there an internal team involved in this project?\" Not confrontational, just standard discovery. Their answer (or dodge) tells you a lot.\n\n  \n2. Replace free demos with paid discovery. Even a small paid phase ($500-1500 depending on scope) filters out everyone who is not serious. Real buyers are happy to pay for it because they get value either way. Time-wasters disappear instantly.\n\n  \n3. If they push back on paid discovery, offer a short presentation or walkthrough of similar past work instead. Never custom-build anything before money changes hands.\n\n  \n4. \"Show us what you can do\" without any commitment from their side = free consulting. A legit client will have a budget, a timeline, and a decision-maker on the call. If any of those three are missing, be cautious.\n\n  \n5. Set a personal rule: no more than 2-3 hours of unpaid work before any engagement. That is enough for a proposal and a rough wireframe, not a full week of building.\n\n  \nThe silver lining is that once you start charging for discovery, the quality of your leads goes way up. The people who stay in the conversation after hearing \"paid discovery\" are almost always the ones who actually close.",

That doesn’t mean walk away immediately, but it does mean no free builds. At most, high-level walkthroughs or concept sketches.\n\nPay attention to how concrete the conversation is. Buyers talk about timelines, budgets, and consequences if something doesn’t get done. Idea collectors talk about possibilities, features, and “what ifs”.\n\nOne simple filter that saves a lot of pain is flipping the ask. Instead of “I’ll build a demo”, say “let’s do a paid discovery or pilot”. Even a small paid engagement changes the dynamic completely. The people who disappear were never serious. The ones who stay usually are.\n\nAnd honestly, some of this only comes with getting burned once or twice.

Just 4-5 lines max.\n\n* What we did this week\n* What's in progress\n* Any blockers or things I need from them\n* What's coming next week\n\nThat's it. No fancy dashboard. No Loom video. Just a few lines in WhatsApp or email wherever they prefer.\n\nThe result? Monday inbox chaos dropped by like 70%. Clients stopped \"checking in\" because they already knew what was happening. And the ones who still wanted calls? At least now the calls had context.\n\nSounds basic, but I resisted this for years thinking \"I'll just update them when there's something big to share.\" Turns out clients don't want big updates. They want to feel like things are moving.\n\nAnyone else have a small process change that had an outsized impact on client relationships?",

The playbook is different too. It's less about keywords and backlinks, more about being the authoritative source that AI models pull from. That means detailed, well-structured content that actually answers specific questions in your niche.\n\nWe noticed this shift when we started tracking where our inbound leads were coming from. A surprising number said they found us through an AI assistant recommendation, not a Google search. Once we started creating content specifically designed to be cited by LLMs, the organic traffic from that channel grew faster than anything we were doing on traditional search.\n\nThe other one I'd add is community-led content on niche platforms.

Gamma and Canva get mentioned a lot for a reason, you can dump your content in and they handle most of the layout so you’re not fighting fonts for 3 hours.  \n  \nAnother angle that actually works well for sales stuff (especially insurance where you’re basically walking people through info step-by-step) is turning your material into a flipbook style presentation with Flipsnack. You upload your PDF or content and it turns into something you can scroll through like a digital brochure, track views, share with clients after the call, etc. Feels more like sending them a polished proposal than “here’s my slide deck”.  \n  \nA lot of people I know mix tools now. Build visuals fast in Canva, export, then present/share in something more interactive. Way less design stress than starting from a blank PowerPoint.",

Not the install-and-forget kind — the recurring service agreements where you inspect systems twice a year and get first-call priority when something breaks.\n\nI work with a lot of trades businesses and the ones printing money aren't chasing big installs. They're the ones sitting on 200-400 maintenance contracts at 15-25/month each. That's 3,000-10,000/month in recurring revenue before a single service call. And maintenance customers convert to equipment replacements at 3-4x the rate of cold leads because you're already their guy when the compressor dies in August.\n\nThe boring part is that it takes 2-3 years to build a meaningful book of contracts. But once you're there, you've essentially built a subscription business with physical lock-in — nobody cancels their AC maintenance in Houston in July. And every house on that route is a potential referral for the neighbor's unit that's making a weird noise.\n\nThe businesses I've seen do this best treat the maintenance visit like a sales call without ever selling anything. The tech checks everything, takes a photo of any wear, and says 'your capacitor is at about 70% — it'll probably last another season but I'd plan on replacing it next spring.' No pressure, just information. The close rate on those follow-ups is insane.",

Send everyone a standard message: \"Shoot me a photo of what needs hauled and your address, I will get you a price within the hour.\" Batch your quoting into 15 minutes at the end of each work block instead of getting pulled out of work constantly.\n\nThe operators I have watched go from one trailer to three did not get there by working harder. They got there by making sure every lead that came in actually converted to a booked job. Right now you are probably losing 40-50% of people who reach out - not because they said no to your price, but because they called someone who picked up.",

You need a booking system that can handle scheduling conflicts and send you reminders, or at least a simple calendar app where you block out travel time between jobs. One thing I came across while looking into this kind of thing is ServiceStories.\n\nIt's mainly for turning your completed jobs into content automatically, but the reason I'm mentioning it is because if you're documenting what you're doing anyway (even just taking a quick photo and some notes), you're building proof of your work that can bring in more customers down the road. Might help with the bigger picture of scaling this thing beyond just you and a trailer. For right now though, get a calendar system locked down.\n\nGoogle Calendar with reminders every 30 minutes before a job would've saved you that landfill trip. Also build in buffer time, don't stack pickups back to back when you know dumps take time too.",

It’s organization.\n\nStep one: stop taking jobs through random channels. Pick one booking method. Either a simple booking form or one business number. Everything funnels there. No scattered WhatsApp threads and phone notes.\n\nStep two: time blocks, not “whenever I can.” Decide your available pickup windows in advance and only offer those. For example, 6–7pm, 7–8pm, Saturday 9–11am, etc. If a slot is full, it’s full. That alone will prevent stacking jobs.\n\nStep three: use a basic scheduling tool or even a shared calendar. Every job gets:  \nClient name  \nAddress  \nDump type  \nLandfill plan  \nPayment status\n\nNo job exists unless it’s on the calendar.\n\nStep four: buffer time. If landfill closes at 5, your last dump run should target 3:30 or 4. You need margin. Side hustle mistakes usually come from overestimating how much fits in a day.\n\nFinally, consider raising prices slightly. When demand exceeds capacity, price is the lever. Fewer jobs at higher margins is better than burnout and missed appointments.\n\nYou don’t need more hustle. You need structure.",

That 10 seconds per pickup is the difference between spotting patterns and just watching chaos happen. Second, as calls start coming in when you're fully booked, resist the urge to take every job. Instead, track which times and days you're getting crushed with inbound calls. That's where your actual demand ceiling is, and it tells you exactly when you need to either raise prices, adjust availability, or make a real hiring decision.\n\n\n\nThird, once you have 30 days of clean data in CurbWaste, run a quick analysis on your actual profit per job versus the time it takes. You might find that three of those four daily jobs are actually worth it, and one isn't. That's the insight that keeps a side hustle from becoming a burnout machine.",

          "body": "Yeah, you’re not alone. The espresso machine thing is basically a rite of passage. Every small business owner has some version of “the one piece of equipment that knows exactly when to die for maximum damage.”\n\nThe part that nobody warns you about is how much of the job is just… maintenance. Not the creative stuff, not the reason you started. Just keeping the machine running (literally and figuratively). Payroll, permits, suppliers changing prices, a key employee calling in sick on your busiest day. It compounds.\n\nThe paperwork thing is real too. You open a coffee shop because you love coffee and community, and then you spend half your time in spreadsheets tracking beans and milk margins.\n\nTwo things worth saying though. First, the fact that you’ve kept it going for a couple of years already puts you ahead of most. The majority of coffee shops don’t make it past 18 months. You’re past the survival phase even if it doesn’t feel like it.\n\nSecond, if the “should I just get an office job” thought is showing up a lot, it’s worth taking seriously. Not as a sign to quit, but as a signal that something in the operation needs to change. Usually it means you’re doing too much yourself. The owners who last are the ones who eventually find a way to stop being the person who has to handle every crisis personally. That might mean a strong second-in-command, or systems that reduce the daily firefighting, or just cutting the parts of the business that drain you the most for the least return.\n\nBut also, some days just suck and the espresso machine breaks and you’re allowed to be annoyed about it.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

I'm done school now things are looking good phone is ringing. But yeah setting everything up initially was very intense.

When you run a small business you wear many hats and sometimes you wear all the hats. \n\nSome people need to look at this before they start a certain type of business because some businesses are more time consuming and labor intensive than others and a multitude of different responsibilities whereas some are only a small amount. \n\nHow long have you been running your business? \nIt's a shame to get burnt out too early but there's always different periods in starting a business. \n\nThere's typically the excitement and early planning and apprehensive phase which can all go together. \nThen, if you get a little bit of business in it smooths out your anxiety a little bit there's just a normal stage or even a building stage. (Most people seem to rush this building stage too much but that's a different discussion).\n\nThen many people stay in the next stage which I call the plug and chug stage for a long time. \nYou can do this for decades. \n\nSome will then go into a growth mentality or phase and others will just stay in the plug and chug maintenance style until they decide to shut down the business, retire, or try to sell it or pass it along to someone else. \n\nEverything you don't do yourself cost you more money and cuts into your profit. \n\nA lot of the small business owners can't stand to pay anybody to do anything and we don't like to pay for anything because we think everything else in the world is a rip-off. \nA lot of these people don't see their own services or products as a rip-off even if they are or even if they're just the going market rate which remember can still be a rip-off. \n\nBut some of them, like myself, will gladly admit if one of our products or services is overpriced or kind of a rip-off but then some of us go so far as to have multiple businesses and make sure the price is stay much lower than the competitive going right because we refuse to be part of the problem. \nUnfortunately there's not many like us today. \n\nSo you either have to become more efficient at doing what you need to do (which is what I did early on so it really wasn't that much work and I seem to have a real knack for getting really good and efficient at doing repetitive things) or you have to sub some things out or find some occasional, part-time or independent contractor style people you can pay to do the things you need done when you need them done. \n\nI have had friends and similar businesses to my own who did this and I used to joke that they were too lazy just to do some of the simple things. \nI have other friends who do absolutely everything themselves but but way too much effort and spend way too much time doing it because it's really not that big of a deal and doesn't have to be that perfect. \n\nSo you have to find a happy medium somewhere that you can live with but I can live with myself and the world a lot better by working a little bit harder and keeping more money in my pocket. \n\nNow for those people who charge a lot more and still maintain plenty of business volume, and are flush with cash, they may not be as motivated to do things themselves. \n\nI'm just such a cheapskate that even if I tripled my profits and income, I would still do things myself. \nIn fact, I would just do less volume so I wouldn't have to do it as much and that's why I wouldn't make three times as much money but maybe at 1.5 or 1.7 I would be happy. \nThis way I wouldn't be doing everything required to make a lot more money but I still wouldn't be paying people.",

Now I’m the one who needs help.\n\nI own a small business that I started and fully funded myself. I own 100% of it. I do everything — the work, bookkeeping, taxes, invoicing, customer relations — all of it. and I've been in business for over 2 years\n\nWhen I first started, things were manageable. I paid for materials, tools, and consumables in cash. No loans, no credit cards, no investors, no debt. It felt safe and controlled.\n\nBut as the months went on, the business kept growing. Bigger clients came in. I moved into B2B work with net 30 terms. At first, I was balancing that with smaller cash-paying jobs, which helped with flow.\n\nNow I’m almost strictly B2B. Dee to me not having any physical time for the smaller intricate jobs that takes 6 hours to complete.\n\nAnd my cash flow is terrible.\n\nOn paper, I’m growing every month. I have recurring clients. Work keeps increasing. But because of net 30 terms, I’m constantly waiting to get paid while needing to buy materials for the next round of jobs. I’ve gotten to the point where I’m worried I won’t be able to afford next month’s materials — even though I have the work lined up.\n\nI’ve tried loans which i cant get approved due to my credit and being high risk and grants, but most “grant” programs I find just want fees to “move my application forward,” which feels sketchy. I don’t want to bury myself in bad debt.\n\nThis situation has stressed me to the point of mental exhaustion. I’ve honestly thought about shutting everything down just to relieve the pressure — even though I know the business is growing and has real potential. It feels like I’m growing too fast and I can’t keep up financially.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with rapid growth creating cash flow problems like this?\n\nHow do you manage net 30 clients without constantly feeling underwater?\n\nI don’t want to quit. I just don’t know how to stabilize this.\n\nAny advice would mean a lot.",

          "body": "I have been exactly here. What you were dealing with is very normal, and when entrepreneurs are able to navigate this successfully, it’s the difference between a successful company and one that goes bankrupt \n\nNet profitability usually is not what kills a business, usually it is cash flow.\n\nI’ll start by saying, Don’t listen to the people that say “don’t accept net 30 terms”. Those people don’t understand the world and industry that you deal with. Unfortunately, in certain industries, the client sets the terms. We are playing in their world. We can decide to play with them, but that’s simply the way it is. Everything has pros and cons. The benefit to these commercial clients is that they are higher volume, higher value jobs. And usually less time spent/higher margins. The con is that they’re usually net 30+.\n\nSo yes, you can decide to not accept net 30 terms, but now you’re working with a different business model. I’m going to assume you excel in this field and have carved a niche, it is a TOTALLY acceptable business model. \n\nIn 2025, we were 48% commercial and 52% residential. Residential has its headaches, but we still show it a lot of attention and are constantly going after residential jobs, because it’s quick cash. This is what makes payroll. This is what keeps cash in the account when our account receivable is 150 K. Without it, inevitably, we would come to a place where we are borrowing high interest debt to make payroll. That’s not what we want to do.\n\nIf residential simply isn’t an option for you, and there’s absolutely no way for you to get any money down on maybe larger projects on the commercial side, you have to be very careful at how fast you “grow”. In a business with a quick cash conversion cycle, this isn’t as much of a problem. \n\n1. I would recommend firstly finding all the ways you can decrease the overall cash conversion cycle. The first thing you can do is look at every single outgoing payment that you make monthly, and find a way to push those payments off so that the money isn’t taken out of your account 30+ days, or as long as possible.\n\nFor example, we put everything on credit cards. We know that cash isn’t due until at least 30 days from the statement close.\n\nWe have negotiated with all vendors to try to push back payments as late as possible. Sometimes it’s possible and sometimes it’s not. But that is always our goal, to push that outgoing cash as late as possible. \n\nBe very, very careful here, this is where financial discipline comes into play. This is where people get into loads of bad debt. You have to know what’s coming in, when it’s coming in, what you can float, Spreadsheets are your best friend. Don’t sleep on this part, it is VERY important. When this first started to become an issue this bought us almost 30 days for a/r to improve before we had to make those usual payments. It helped us get ahead of the curve and if you haven’t done this yet DO IT. \n\n2. Now you have to figure out how to decrease the cash conversion cycle even more based on income. Is there any possible way to get down payments, can you do more residential, factoring (in extreme case), but you get the idea.\n\n3. Monitor monito monitor monitor. Hire somebody to be in charge of your account receivable. This is a full-time job for us. Do absolutely everything you can to stay on these people. In the commercial world, putting liens on things, this is standard practice. They don’t take it personally, all it does is make you become one of the first people that they pay. We send a letter of intense often, and quiet, we are still working with to this day. We’ve never lost a commercial client by sending a letter of intent. All it does is make sure that it gets to the owner.\n\nHit me up sometime if you ever want to discuss this! There are a lot of things that you can do, but you have to be incredibly intentional",

A bank can give you the liquid cash a day or two after you ship (90%, with the other 10% released when your customer pays). You basically have a rolling loan with the bank, but because it's secured (against your invoices) you get lower interest payments than you would if you used an overdraft etc. \nYou can insure the invoices, so if a customer goes bankrupt and cannot pay, you are insured. Otherwise if you're not insured and that happens, you immediately owe the bank the unpaid value.

Ask them to review your books thoroughly. Have them analyze your Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L), Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement. If your balance sheet shows structural issues, your business model may be failing. Numbers do not lie.\n\n3. Review all Net 30 customers carefully.

As a basic benchmark, if your profit does not exceed approximately 12%, your net return may not justify the risk.

If you cannot outperform safer investment , your strategy may involve high risk with insufficient return. This is a fundamental business principle.\n\n5.

Know exactly what's coming in when.\n• Automated payment reminders at 20, 25, and 30 days. Most customers pay faster when reminded professionally.\n• Cash flow projections updated daily. Sounds fancy but it's just a spreadsheet that shows you your expected cash position for the next 60 days.\n\nThe payment terms issue is real. I started offering 2% discount for payment within 10 days, full price for Net 30. About 40% of customers took the early payment discount.\n\nFor immediate relief: pick your best 2-3 customers and ask for one accelerated payment as a favor. Most will do it if you have a good relationship.\n\nLong term: you need a line of credit for exactly this situation. Growing businesses need working capital financing.\n\nWhat industry are you in?

It gives you breathing room without relying on loans with bad terms.\n\t2.\tOutsource non-core tasks – Bookkeeping, invoicing, or even customer follow-ups can be handled by someone else. That frees you to focus on the work that actually brings in revenue.\n\t3.\tSegment your clients – Keep some smaller, quick-turnaround jobs that pay cash to maintain positive cash flow. Maybe hire someone part-time to handle these jobs, so you can focus on the bigger B2B contracts without sinking into a cash crunch.\n\t4.\tInvoice strategy – I know others already covered this but you can offer small incentives for early payment, or split larger invoices into smaller milestones to reduce the net 30 waiting period. Even partial upfront payment helps cover materials.\n\nHope sone of this helps and wish you the best!",

No one but you should have the ability to release payments. \n- Post a job and hire a senior technical person who has been in the pressure vessel industry for good 15-20 years.\n- If unable to hire this experienced person full time, bring him on a retainer and learn the trade from him. He could be a consultant and he should be your guy! \n- Get your hands dirty. Learn the trade on the ground. For example, if you get a new order, tell the current team that you will work with them and finish the entire order with you on the line.  Even if it means working alongside the labor because unless you know the product/process inside out, they will/may keep fooling you. \n- Contact the customer that complained about the product. Check with your consultant that you will bring on board on what went sideways and consult your internal technical team as well. It could just be a case of order getting completed but the revenue may be pocketed by someone internally. \n- Investigate the dropped revenue and check with those clients who no longer deal with your company on what went wrong? \n\nTake immediate control before your family/employees eat the company out from the inside. Good luck! ",

          "body": "Hello! What made me stop and read this fully is your age. 21. Most people would just walk away in your situation but you are asking how to take responsibility and that is serious intent which matters.\n\nA quick context for you so you know where I am coming from:  I have worked with multiple agencies and founder-led businesses over the last 15 years. I have seen revenue collapse, family politics, silent mismanagement, and operational chaos up close. I don’t run a fabrication business, but I understand business structure, leadership drift, and how systems break. \n\nI would address your post as follows: \n\nFirstly, separate emotions from structure. Right now you have 4 parallel problems (as per your post):\n\n1. Technical knowledge gap\n\n2. Operational breakdown\n\n3. Financial opacity\n\n4. Family power dynamics\n\nIf you try to solve it all at once, you will end up drowning. \n\nHere is what your first 90 days should look like:\n\nMonth 1: Observe, don’t react: Sit inside operations daily. Shop floor. Client calls. Vendor calls.\n\nAsk dumb questions. Take notes.\n\nGet access to full financials; last 24 months. Cash flow, receivables, payables. Everything related to money coming in and going out. \n\nList all active orders and their status. Do not assume anything. Note it only if it exists on paper. \n\nYour only focus in Month 1: understand the business reality.\n\nMonth 2: Audit quietly\n\nCheck: Why did revenue fall from 7 to 2? Lost clients? Pricing? Delays? Quality issues?\n\nSpeak to 3–5 old clients directly. Ask what changed.\n\nCheck production rejection rate and complaint logs.\n\nMap who actually makes decisions today. On paper and in reality.\n\n\nIf you suspect mismanagement, you need data to validate it and not confrontation.\n\nMonth 3: Take controlled authority\n\nDefine weekly production targets.\n\nImplement a simple reporting rhythm (daily output, order status, cash position).\n\nSeparate relatives from roles. No one is “family” in a production meeting. Only role and output matter.\n\n\nNow about workers older than you: you do not earn authority through volume. You earn it through clarity.\n\nDon’t say “I think.”\nSay: “This is the plan for this week. Here’s what we are tracking.” Calm. Measured. Structured. Consistent.\n\nOn technical learning: You do not need to become the best welder. You need enough knowledge to not be fooled.\n\nStart with: Basic pressure vessel fundamentals\n\n1. ASME codes overview\n\n2. Welding process basics\n\n3. Quality inspection checklist\n\n4. Visit competitors quietly if possible\n\nSpend 60–90 mins daily learning for 6 months. This compounding matters. Most importantly, control cash first. Every rupee. A traditional business dies from cash suffocation before ego issues.\n\nAnd one hard truth: If your cousin is mismanaging, this will become political. So build numbers as proof before you build arguments.\n\nI don't think you are unprepared, you are just early to the game. If you want, you can reach out directly. I am not an industry expert in fabrication, but I can help you think through structure, authority, and 90-day execution without emotion. All the best!",

All of us spent many many hours in our youth working in the business, so even if we had been away for 5-15 years, we had familiarity and knew people. \n\nOne brother had been accepted to a PhD program and had 6 months until it starts and was just working ac lab job he could easily quit. \n\nAnother brother had an mbA and was working for a big-5 consulting firm but had been told he wasn’t on track to make partner. He had 12 months to find other work and they let him have up to a month off to go take care of the family business. \n\nBut also different from yours, the business finances were in shambles and none of us knew (not even my mom). \n\nI guess the reason I tell this story even though different is that these first months are critical. You keep saying that you will hire a manager once you have the money, but the whole thing could be lost by then. \n\nAfter everything was stabilized, we ended up selling to cousins running a similar business two towns over. It ended up great for my mom, who didn’t have to go start looking for her first job since college at age 56, but we had to jump in immediately to make sure the business was worth something to sell.",

You might be able to have A.I. figure out ways to at least give you some solid overviews. I'm a big believer in when I want to learn anything, I need to start focusing on the most basic, elementary elements before trying to say \"remember random things\".\n\nI view that like a tree analogy. You want to understand some of the roots, then the main part of the tree, eventually get to the branches, and finally get to the leaves. People get overwhelmed when they start with random leaves...   This is just about that business as a whole. Next piece would be simply being in and around the business and just absorbing what's going on. I also would probably have AI research a bunch of competitors and try to figure out what they are doing that's working well. If you have any documented SOPs, I certainly would be putting those into AI for analysis.\n\nThere's a lot more on the human side, like the distrust of the cousin and perhaps the element that your time is split between serious study and this business dilemma. If you actually have a controlling interest in this business, then I would think the three things you may want are either to learn it and run it yourself successfully, or to get more experienced management to come help turn it around and increase the value of it. Build water! Then either way, possibly set it up to sell. Right now, you don't want to set it up to sell if you're 65% down in revenue with problems.

It sounds like your father was the glue that kept the entire operation running and your sales will go to zero soon if no one else knows what’s going on.  A lot of small businesses go this direction unfortunately.  You may need to figure out how much runway you have - what are your costs / month. What are your employee wages / month. Then how much money is currently in the bank and how much do you have currently invoiced?  You may have a few months left before you run out of money and employees can no longer be paid. \n\nIf you insist on running it yourself you need to understand what gaps now exist in the business now that your father is no longer here. What specific business-critical roles/responsibilities belonged to him? which can be transferred to current employees, and which can be transferred to you, if you can learn them?. The rest may need to be hired out to a new employee. \n\nIt helps to create a value stream map of the entire business operation from quotation to product delivery. It can be a tedious process but can help you got a real handle on the workflow and identifying technical gaps. You may find that your dad was responsible for some technical/compliance related thing (like an engineering stamp?) that the entire business hinges on and also requires education/training/certification that will be impossible to replace from within.",

If revenue drops because of poor quality, so should the salary drop/firing happen. Burtal but this is how you get control in any business. Never hesitate to fire or give pay cuts to people if productivity or revenue is going low. Give a paycut on long breaks/poor output, and you will be surprised by the magic.   \n2. a) Customer is KING. Meet them, understand the issue, and understand what the problem is. Talk to the person/team in your company who manages it. If there is no one fill the gap. If there is someone already, then find the issue; either they need to be fired or schooled properly.   \n2. b) Also, if you are in a concentrated business where a few customers dictate a lot of revenue, and there is no other face right now, you will also need to step up or get a face. Impressions matter a lot many times, and you will have to see and decide. Don't be a person they can't trust. Don't promise what you don't know. It's better to speak less than wrong.   \n3. Have the right mix of patience + speed. Very important, don't let emotions make you hasty decisions. If you see someone even cheating on you, maybe even a cousin, the first step would be still play a friend and just migrate all important information from them to someone you trust or yourself, and then take actions againts them. Still, you need to have speed else world is too competitive, and someone else will eat your lunch. Competitors are always on the lookout for your weak spots. Same for the positive side, don't be overjoyous on large orders, have patience, scale with patience.   \n4. Find a mentor whom you can trust and who has seen at least 5x or more scale of your current business. Both points are equally important. This should not be the immediate priority, but definitely in the long run. But don't trust anyone blindly. \n\nMade a lot of mistakes in my early 20s, these are just to help. ",

Here's what I'd focus on in the next 30 days:\n\nBrand mentions without links actually matter a lot for entity recognition. Get mentioned in local news, industry blogs, chamber of commerce newsletters, even podcast interviews where your business name gets said out loud (transcripts get indexed). Google uses these to understand what your brand \"is.\"\n\nContent that explicitly answers \"What is [Your Business Name]?\" in multiple places. Create a detailed About page, a FAQ that addresses your specific services, and a few blog posts that use your exact brand name in the title and body naturally. You want Google to see 10+ pages across the web clearly stating what you do.\n\nBacklinks still help, but quality over quantity. One link from a relevant industry site or local news outlet is worth 50 directory links. Reach out to suppliers, partners, anyone who already works with you and ask if they'll add you to their partners page.\n\nLocal press is underrated. Send a simple story pitch to your local news about what makes your business different or any community involvement. Even a small mention with your name and what you do can shift Google's understanding.\n\nSpeed matters too. If someone already claimed your brand name on social platforms or review sites, make sure you're active there and linking back to your site. Consistency across channels signals authority.\n\nIf I had 30 days, I'd do local PR first (easiest brand mention), then content clarifying exactly what you are (FAQ + About pages), then reach out for 3 to 5 quality backlinks from real partners. You're not fighting an algorithm, you're teaching Google what your brand actually is.\n\nHave you checked Google Search Console to see what queries are actually triggering your site? Sometimes the issue is your pages aren't ranking for your own brand name, which is a different fix.",

Google's algorithm is essentially saying your competitor has stronger brand signals than you do for your own brand query.\n\nBased on what you've already done (which are good foundational steps), here's what I'd prioritize in your 30-day window:\n\n1. Brand mention campaigns - Reach out to past customers for testimonials that specifically mention your brand name. Even unlinked mentions help Google understand brand association.\n\n2. Strategic content creation - Create a 'Brand vs Alternatives' comparison page that naturally positions you as the original/primary option. This helps clarify the relationship to Google.\n\n3. Local press push - One solid local business feature with your brand name in the headline often carries more weight than dozens of directory listings.\n\n4. Google Business Profile optimization - Post regularly with your exact brand name in the content. The more fresh, brand-specific content, the better.\n\nThe key insight: Google needs to see consistent signals that YOU are the primary entity associated with your brand name, not just that you exist. It's about brand signal strength, not just SEO basics.\n\nWhat industry are you in? Sometimes there are industry-specific approaches that work faster.",

          "body": "this is frustrating bc you're basically losing business to Google's confusion about your own brand name. One thing people miss: AI overviews (and ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc) are pulling from different sources than traditional SEO, so the usual fixes don't always work the same way. They're looking at sentiment, context, and how your brand gets described across the web, not just keywords and backlinks.\n\nIf I had 30 days I'd focus on getting more third-party mentions that describe what you do and why you're different. Local press is good. Industry blogs, review sites, even Reddit threads where people naturally recommend you.\n\nThe goal is teaching AI tools the context around your brand so they stop confusing you with competitors. Brandlight is worth checking out for this exact problem. They help you see what AI tools are actually saying about your brand and guide you on what content changes will help you show up correctly in those answers.\n\nSince this is an AI overview issue and not just traditional search, having that visibility could save you alot of time guessing",

          "body": "Because most business advice comes from people who’ve never had to get a stranger to trust them with no brand, no proof, and no referral.\n\nThe corporate playbook assumes you already have traffic, pipeline, brand recognition, and a sales team. Strip all that away and you’re left with the actual hard part — getting someone who has no reason to care about you to believe you can solve their problem.\n\nI’ve spent 15+ years working with small service businesses and I’ll tell you what actually works at that stage because it’s stupidly simple and nobody talks about it.\n\nGo find people who have the problem you solve and tell them what’s wrong. For free. No pitch. No “let me know if you need help.” Just show them something about their own situation that they didn’t see before.\n\nI literally got my first handful of clients by looking at local businesses and pointing out specific things that were costing them money. Not vague “your marketing could be better” stuff. Specific, concrete, “you’re losing customers here and here’s why” stuff. Half of them didn’t hire me. The other half couldn’t hire me fast enough because nobody had ever just told them the truth without trying to sell them something first.\n\nThat’s the part the LinkedIn crowd will never teach you. At the startup and small business level, the sale happens when someone realizes you see their problem more clearly than they do. Not when you pitch them a solution. Not when you close them with some framework. When they feel genuinely understood by someone who clearly knows what they’re looking at.\n\nThe advice isn’t sexy. Go find 10 businesses this week. Look at what they’re doing. Tell them what you see. Don’t ask for anything. Some of them will ask you what it would cost to fix it. That’s your first clients.\n\nEverything else — the funnels, the content strategy, the sales process — that’s all stuff you build after you’ve proven you can actually help someone. Not before.",

Because most of the people giving advice skipped the part you are in.\n\nThey are talking about optimizing pipelines and tightening close rates.\n\nYou are just trying to get someone to say yes.\n\nEarly stage problems are not “How do I increase conversion by 2 percent?”\n\nThey are:\n\nHow do I get my first 5 customers?\n\nHow do I talk to businesses when nobody knows who we are?\n\nHow do I not feel like I am faking it every time I pitch?\n\nThe reason it all sounds corporate is because it is optimization advice, not survival advice.\n\nHere is the simple version nobody says clearly.\n\nSales only happen in 4 ways:\n\nKnown. People who already know you.\n\nUnknown. Strangers you reach out to directly.\n\nOrganic. Content people find over time.\n\nPaid. Ads, affiliates, sponsorships.\n\nThat's it. All current, past and future conversations will fall into one of those buckets.\n\nMost startups try to jump straight to organic or paid because it feels scalable and legit. It's a tremendous waste of capital and time to try and validate your stuff by paying to show it to others.\n\nBut if you cannot sell one on one to:\n\nSomeone who already knows you\n\nOr a complete stranger\n\nThen ads will just amplify the fact that the offer or messaging is not dialed in yet.\n\nThe unsexy path actually works:\n\nFirst, go to your “known” network. Make a list of 20 people. Start conversations. Not hard pitches. Just real conversations. There should be somebody who's you either know or somebody who knows somebody else in your network who could utilize your solution typically.\n\nThen move to “unknown.” Pick one channel. Cold email, cold call, DMs, whatever. Talk to 5 strangers a day. You will suck at first. That is the point. Just execute, everybody wants some sort of magic bullet. They're looking for a Xanax pill that's going to just blow them up overnight when really what they need is physical therapy. You have to get really good at selling this thing. Two strangers before you can graduate to the next steps.\n\nOnce you can consistently sell one on one, then start making content based on the exact questions people keep asking you.\n\nThen, and only then, scale it with paid.\n\nYour friend is partially right about sales, it's the lifeblood of any business and the reality is that most businesses are shockingly bad at it.\n\nIt is because you are guessing which of the four lanes you are actually in.\n\nFor now you just need to stick with one thing and get really good at that channel.\n\n[I explain the whole breakdown here if you want it laid out clearly.](https://youtu.be/5EjzIA-Zyd8?si=zuPJs2PCpaC2-Exn)\n\nIt will probably save you a lot of wasted time and money",

Turn off one of those connections and it should cut that 2 hours down to nothing.\n\nFor the categories issue, if you're selling physical products, set up item-based income tracking instead of transaction-by-transaction categorization. One SKU = one income account. Stripe fees and refunds can batch at month-end instead of per-transaction.\n\nThe $147 mystery is probably a timing mismatch between when Stripe deposits vs when QB records the sale. If you're on cash basis, switch your Stripe connection to record on deposit date, not sale date.\n\nMonth-end for a $400k e-commerce business should be closer to 2-3 hours, not 10. Most of what you're doing is fixing preventable errors, not actual closing work.\n\nAre you tracking inventory in QuickBooks or separately? That changes the whole workflow.",

I imagine a professional bookkeeper could cut that down, but it may take you a while to get to the level you can confidently close the books in significantly less time.\n\nMy feeling regarding bookkeeping is twofold: \n\n1) if you hire a bookkeeper, you can spend that time working on something else to actually grow the business instead of trying to learn accounting software that isn’t in your wheelhouse. While this is more true when the owner is a service provider (ie. go get one more client and it pays for the bookkeeper), I still think it is true in an e-commerce business as well. Go spend time on revenue generating tasks that you’re best at, and the bookkeeping will get done without you.\n\n2) e-commerce is one of the hardest types of bookkeeping, so doing it yourself will take a long time to get right. With sales tax and inventory in particular, it is just a longer process, whether it’s you or a bookkeeper handling it.\n\nIf you go the bookkeeper route, I would bet it wouldn’t be nearly as high as the $1500 per month you said. Maybe that’s what your CPA quoted you? Roughly half that is what I would think is reasonable.\n\nIf you do it yourself, you will get better! It gets easier each month as you learn the process. But just make sure it’s worth it in your mind to be spending that much time on this.",

They match orders, fees, refunds, and payouts automatically instead of dumping raw transactions that you have to untangle. Costs like $20-50/month but saves hours.\n\nFor the wrong categories - there are AI categorization tools now that learn your patterns. Way more accurate than QB's built-in rules after a month of training.\n\nThe $147 mystery - 90% of the time that's Stripe fees not matching up or a payout timing issue crossing month boundaries. The integrations I mentioned handle this automatically.\n\nOn bookkeepers - at $400k e-commerce you're probably at the point where a monthly check-in ($200-400/mo for someone who just reviews and catches errors) makes more sense than full-service.

Bookkeeping takes longer and is less accurate the more \"complexity drivers\" your business has.  \nThe key is to figure out what those complexity drivers are, and how much control you have over them with both your digital and also real life processes.  \nUsing personal accounts to pay for business expenses, and vice versa, is huge complexity driver that can disappear simply by the business owner stopping that bad habit.  100% control on that one.  Employees, AP, AR, Inventory, all varying complexity drivers you're stuck with.  What real life processes and standardizations can happen to reduce their time suck?  \nE-commerce is a HUGE complexity driver, greater than we may recognize.  Though, I think you're feeling it right now!!  Ask your accountant if they can see any ways to reduce the complexity here (and in other areas).  They may have some great insights.  I know many e-commerce firms use A2X, but I don't have experience there myself. In Canada, there's a great firm [https://www.financly.ca/](https://www.financly.ca/) (no affiliation, I just refer them cuz they're the best I know) that does e-commerce bookkeeping consultation.  Ugh, stripe, paypal, shopify... these are all the bane of my existence!   It's not you!  It's them!  \nPerhaps, instead of hiring a bookkeeper to do your bookkeeping (for now, but a great delegation option as you scale, so you can spend time growing the business, not in the trenches that you can outsource), is to find a bookkeeper who is e-commerce niched up to give you a couple of consultation meetings to help reduce the complexity of your workflows and maybe get some good time saving integrations working for you.  \nGod Speed my friend!",

😆 \n\nI think a lot of people end up giving people bad advice because they give them a list of points of things they think they should do and people think they have to do all these things and sometimes it messes people up more than it helps them. \n\nThe best thing I can say is set back a few steps and look at the big picture and think out of the box. \nFigure out what you really want to do and then do some research on that industry even if it means calling and talking to some other companies or going there to feel them out acting like you're a potential customer. \nThen evaluate things and see if this actually is feasible to do. \nA lot of dreamers in the world have gone in everywhere from a little bit to all the way and ended up failing pretty quickly because they didn't really get enough information and it was going to be an uphill battle from the beginning for what they were trying to do. \n\nSome markets are so saturated with certain businesses and industries, that is probably not a very good idea to come in with another one thinking you're somehow going to be different, better or can market the other people who are already established and make enough money to survive. \nYou may, but there's a higher likelihood that you may not. \nLook at the abysmal statistics of small business failures and the first year, by year 3, by year 10 etc. \n\nI currently have three businesses and have beat the odds with all three of them because one has been in business for over 30 years, one for over 15 and the other for a little over 10. \n\nThe fact that I have three or at least more than one might be the only reason I've beaten those odds. \nIf I would have stuck with the first business and would have had to make all the money I needed and use it as my sole source of income, I might have thrown in the towel like many other people in that industry did years ago. \n\nSince I had at least one other stream of income from another business at that time and then later added another, it wasn't necessary for that business to make what it used to when the economy turned down. \nIt's never recovered to the levels it was in 2008 but I'm okay with that. \n\nI also think a big thing in business and young people and startup businesses is not trying to set the world on fire. \n\nGo small, and keep it small for a long time and maybe forever. \nDon't bite off more than you can chill and don't go into crazy debt with startup costs because some people never recover from this and are still paying off debts after their business has long been shuttered \n\nSeen many, many people in all three of my industries do just this. \nThey come out of the gate too strong wanting to be as nice as the people that have been around for decades and want everyone to know they're out there and to show off with their nice shiny building or their brand new equipment etc. \n\nMost of these places are gone within 2 years and many even sooner than that. \nThey end up liquidating a lot of that equipment for pennies on the dollar and frankly, that's a good time to buy and stuff if you're interested in going into one of those businesses.\n\nJust because they failed does not mean you will because often it's not the industry or the type of business that is the problem but rather the way the people started it and the way they tried to run it. \n\nI actually believe in more of a non mainstream approach to running businesses. \nThe basic principles I have is to keep it small and keep it simple. \nHave a business where you can do almost everything yourself and do it so you can't be lazy. \nYou wear many hats as a small business owner. \n\nYou will be head of marketing and do most of your own advertising and don't pay many  people for it either.\nYou will be the receptionist,  manager, all the workers, janitor, repair person etc.\n\nAnd by all means, don't be like so many people in the past few years who have started businesses who start by deciding how much money they either want to make or need to make and then base the prices from that! \n\nThat is a terrible business approach and that's being part of the problem and why the cost of living is so high today. \n\nPeople should start a business because they have a passion to do it, because they simply don't want to work for other people, because they want more freedom in their own schedule, or because they're just a control freak and want to make all decisions without anyone else's input. \nThere are probably more reasons but these are all good ones or common ones. \n\nNot everyone specifically starts a business to replace their entire full amount of income from their full-time occupation and that's okay. \n\nA lot of people end up with a smaller side business and then it grows the point where they do quit their full-time job but too many people want that or even expect that which can be their downfall. \nIf there's plenty of business then, you know what they say, volume hides a multitude of sin so some people get by with charging is overnight prices and they keep doing it but I refuse to be part of the problem. \n\nIn two of my businesses, I could double my prices tomorrow and people would still be on a waiting list and lined up to have my services but I refuse to do that.",

          "body": "went down a rabbit hole on this last month because I was curious how B2B companies handle Reddit without getting torched for self-promo. The short answer is yes, it's worth monitoring, but you have to be strategic about how you show up. When someone asks for the best X in your city, that's gold.\n\nThose threads rank high in Google too, so it's not just the Reddit traffic, it's search visibility for months after. The trick is being helpful first. If you're just dropping your business name with no context, you'll get downvoted fast.\n\nBut if you can actually contribute to the conversation and your business genuinely fits, people appreciate it. I'd track your industry keywords and location mentions at minimum. Even just searching \"[your city] + [your industry]\" once a day can catch those recommendation threads before they're buried.\n\nSome businesses take it further and hire a done-for-you service to handle it completely. I stumbled onto Community Mentions while researching this, and they basically find the relevant threads, engage on your behalf, and handle the whole compliance side so you don't accidentally cross into spam territory. Seems like a smart move if you don't have bandwidth to monitor and post daily yourself, especially for B2B where the stakes are higher.\n\nFor local stuff tho, you could probably DIY it. Set up a few keyword alerts, jump in when it makes sense, be genuinely helpful. The ROI can be suprisingly good even from just a handful of comment clicks per month.",

We used to rely on a lot of external apps to handle all of our non-clinical and support functions, but I’ve been surprised how much of that stuff can really be tackled with simple Microsoft 365 programs. Sharepointe, Lists, Forms, Teams, PowerBI, Power Automate, etc. If those apps don’t cut it I just cook something up in Azure and use DevOps instead of GitHub \n\nThe only essential external apps I can’t get rid of are Gusto payroll and Quickbooks Desktop. So our full stack is basically EHR + M365 + a few custom Azure deployments + Payroll + Quickbooks. This handles 90% of our workload. The other 10% is nonessential productivity stuff like Canva, Adobe, Scribe/Folge, etc. \n\nOur headcount is around 30, and this works for us, but again, we have an EHR as the centerpiece of our software stack.",

S Corps, nonprofits, Airbnb hosts. The actual work I'm good at. Finding clients is a different story.\n\nRight now I'm using Bark which is a lead marketplace where you pay to contact people. It's expensive and brutal. Spent like $400 on credits and landed one client. Cold emails got maybe 2% response. LinkedIn posts just get likes from other bookkeepers, not business owners.\n\nThe frustrating part is I know these people exist. Business owners drowning in receipts, avoiding their books, dreading tax season. But when it's time to actually hire someone they ghost or say they'll think about it.\n\nSo for people running remote service businesses who figured this out, where did your first real clients come from? Was it networking, content, ads, pure hustle? And how long before you weren't constantly scrambling for the next one?\n\nTrying to figure out if I'm doing something wrong or if this is just the grind of starting from scratch.",

I went through something similar when I transitioned from fintech to running my own thing.\n\n  \nHere's what actually worked for me: stop competing on price in those marketplaces and start positioning yourself as the \"QuickBooks specialist for X type of business.\" Pick one niche - like Airbnb hosts or nonprofits - and become THE person for that. Your messaging becomes way more targeted and you can charge more because you actually understand their specific pain points.\n\n  \nFor outreach, I'd focus on warm connections first. Join Facebook groups where your ideal clients hang out. Don't pitch - just answer questions and be helpful. The referrals will start coming. Also, I used to spend entire afternoons building email campaigns for follow-ups. Now I just describe what I want in Brew and its done in like 60 seconds, so I can focus more time on actually talking to prospects instead of wrestling with email templates.\n\n  \nThe key is playing the long game.

A few things that moved the needle:\n\nFind the places your ideal clients hang out. For S Corps and Airbnb hosts, local landlord associations, real estate investor meetups, small business networking groups. Show up, be helpful, don't pitch. When someone mentions their bookkeeping nightmare, you're already the person they know.\n\nPartner with people who touch your clients first. CPAs who don't offer bookkeeping, business attorneys, payroll companies. They refer you, you refer them.\n\nContent that answers the specific questions your clients are Googling. Not generic stuff, 'How to categorize Airbnb expenses in QuickBooks' or 'S Corp bookkeeping mistakes that trigger audits.' Blog posts, quick videos, whatever. SEO takes time but those leads are gold.\n\nThe grind is real at the start. Took me about 6-8 months before referrals started coming in regularly and I wasn't constantly hunting.
