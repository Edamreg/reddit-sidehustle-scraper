Some companies hire for that work from home and it pays better than surveys. The hours are usually flexible and your experience would actually be valuable. Might be worth researching even if it takes a bit to get into.\n\nWith your situation though, surveys might actually be one of the few things that fits your needs if the healthcare stuff doesn't pan out. I use Babki and Prolific and make around $300/month. You can do them literally whenever you have 15 to 20 minutes between appointments or when you're feeling okay. No startup costs, no schedule commitments, just open the app when you can. It's not huge money but it sounds like you need something flexible more than something high paying.",

I'd of course like to get into more skilled work, where I'll be able to make more in short bouts.\n\nUnfortunately, I realistically can’t take a job/apprenticeship right now to learn a trade, and I don’t have the capital to buy specialized equipment and hope it pays off. I’m a student with a car and can invest under $1,000.\n\nSo what I'm wondering is do any of you have any ideas, or similar stories? I know sometimes it's just worth it to bite off more than you can chew and learn as you go along.\n\nI'm thinking things like drywall repair, TV mounting, painting. All of which I have no experience with whatsoever. There is also things like house cleaning on the list, which I of course have some experience with, but maybe not enough to charge much for it.\n\nAnd as a P.S, I am okay with some ideas that might be well over $1,000. I do want to start things long into the future too, but would prefer some more accessible ideas so I can at least get closer to that capital.",

      "selftext": "So I've been building this tech stack for my own consulting business and I'm curious if any of this resonates with other solo creators:\n\nMy ceiling for take home has been at the $200-300K mark. I was just stuck and getting a little burnt. I wasn't aligned in my business, my systems were fatiguing to manage. Too many tools and software costs.\n\n**What I'm building for myself and eventually the broader market:**\n\n* Basically a lightweight ERP that connects all my business infrastructure (payments, client management, product delivery, analytics) in one place instead of 12 different tools \n* Product creation system - lets me efficiently build and sell interactive GPT products, ebooks, and courses without rebuilding the wheel each time. Same backend, different knowledge products\n\n**The result:** I'm generating way more value with less direct effort because the system coordinates opportunities instead of me manually connecting dots.\n\n**My question for y'all:**\n\nIf you're building knowledge products or running a solo business, which of these pain points hits hardest?\n\n* Your business tools don't talk to each other (data lives in silos)\n* You can't see your actual business health without pulling 5 reports\n* You're the bottleneck for everything because there's no system\n* You have no leverage - everything requires YOUR time\n* Your clients/audience don't collaborate with each other (untapped network effects)\n\nTrying to figure out if this problem is valuable to build as a product or if other creators would want to use/pay for or explore any of this infrastructure.",

          "body": "Hi. Interesting points. In my opinion, disparate systems should not necessarily be a problem. Each piece of software potentially has its niche, its strong points, and its drawbacks. The most important is that they have integration points, exposed APIs, at least, to allow you to build some automation. If not, time to move on.\n\nFrom a reporting point of view, again, different systems shouldn't hold you back in an ideal world. There are great (paid) BI tools that thrive on just this - bringing different platforms and systems together, to provide a holistic view. And in the absence of budget, it is totally possibly to build this yourself, in python, using some of the vast viz libraries.\n\n  \nOf course my comments are quite generic, vanilla. So DM me with some specifics. \n\n  \nData always live in silos, even in the best of systems and most efficient of companies. Different roles, rights, privileges. Pissing contests to get to the data, politics that prevent efficient management. So the fact that you at least have all access, god mode, is already a win in my book.",

For those who don't know, it’s basically an arbitrage model.\n\nThe Math: You have High-Net-Worth clients who want a \"Plan B\" passport (St. Kitts, Portugal, etc.). They pay huge government fees ($100k+).\n\n* The Real Estate/Legal Partners: These guys handle the actual filing and paperwork on the ground.\n* The Agency : I handle the client strategy and intro.\n* The Commission: Standard referral fees on a Caribbean file are $20k to $25k per family. EU deals vary but often hit €10k+.\n\nThe Pros: The margins are absurd roughly 90% because I have zero employees and no office. It's fully remote. I just maintain the B2B contracts with the lawyers and field the leads.\n\nThe Cons (and why I’m getting out): It’s a \"hunter\" business. If you aren't working the leads, nothing closes. It’s not passive recurring revenue (SaaS), it’s transactional \"eat what you kill.\"\n\nThe Lesson: I realized that while the cash flow is great for a solo operator, I want to build equity in a scalable product, not a service.\n\nI’m actually seeking to offloading my client assets and partner contracts to so I can focus on a new venture($50K)\n\nHappy to answer questions about how the CBI/RBI industry commissions work if anyone is looking at this vertical. It’s a bit of a \"black box\" industry so the unit economics usually surprise people.",

Keep in mind especially with small businesses, profit margins are small to begin with so getting someone to spend $1500 on a site and $200+ a month on something isn’t always easy, especially if what your offering can be done by themselves in 15 minutes for $50/mo on Shopify. If you get into a pricing war it’s a race to the bottom and then you’re just screwing yourself in the long run. You’ll start burning your word of mouth references by not continuing to provide good service to your existing customers in the long run. \n\nThe issue I’ve ran into and so have my buddies is pricing, you’re going to be bombarded with requests for changes and updates constantly. I recommend putting some thought into how you want to charge for ongoing service, be it monthly, per change, etc etc. failing to do so will turn it into your full time job for little benefit.\n\nMy buddies began taking jobs and outsourcing to India for his sites and it did pretty well for him, but it felt disingenuous to me so I never tried it.\n\nDon’t let any of this talk you out of it, you can make good money on the side with this. Like anything it’s going to take some effort for it to be profitable. \n\nAlso recommend finding a local photographer who can take product/food photos for you as most of my commissions involved that side of things at some point.",

      "selftext": "Alright so I jumped into the vending machine thing back in July after seeing it mentioned here a bunch. Bought two refurbished machines for about $3,200, spent another $400 on initial snacks and drinks and found two spots to put them.\n\nFirst one's in an office building with around 50 people. That one does pretty well, usually brings in $280 to $350 a month. Second one's at an auto repair shop and it's more hit or miss, anywhere from $120 to $180. After buying inventory every month and gas to go restock them, I'm clearing maybe $130-150 profit. Not life changing but it covers my car payment so I'm not complaining.\n\nHere's the thing though - it's not as passive as people make it sound. I'm driving out every two weeks to restock, which takes a couple hours where i need breaks in between to play on myprize. Had to fix a jammed bill thing once that cost me $85. Someone tried to break into the one at the auto shop but didn't get anything, just messed up the lock a bit. The office building location is honestly carrying this whole thing. If I only had the repair shop one I'd probably be breaking even or losing money. I'm learning location really is the whole game here. Thinking about getting a third machine but I'm being picky about where it goes. Not trying to end up with another mediocre spot.\n\nAnyone else doing this? What kind of numbers are you seeing?",

      "selftext": "Four months ago I saw those accounts reading AITA stories getting millions of views. I was like fuck it I'll try.\n\nFirst 10 videos were complete trash. Just my voice over text on screen. Maybe 300 views each. I was ready to delete the whole account.\n\nThen I noticed something. The accounts that were actually blowing up all had a person on screen. Not a real person, like some AI thing. I figured maybe that's what I was missing.\n\nStarted using ElevenLabs for voice cause I sound terrible on recordings. For the avatar I use APOB, edit everything in CapCut. Took forever to figure out but got something that works.\n\nFirst video with an actual face on screen got 4,800 views. I almost shit myself. Next one got 8,000. Then one randomly blew up to 35k and I thought I figured it out.\n\nI didn't figure it out.\n\nIt's been a couple months since then and I still have no idea what makes a video work. Some get 5k views. Some get 60k. One hit 240k and I tried to recreate it like 10 times. Nothing. The algorithm makes no sense.\n\nRight now I'm at:\n\n\\- 2-3 videos a day (used to do 4 but I was losing my mind)\n\n\\- 25k to 40k views per video on average but it's all over the place\n\n\\- 30-40 minutes per video, finding stories takes the longest\n\n\\- Making around $700/month total between TikTok and brand deals\n\nThe process is pretty simple. Find a story on Reddit, usually AITA cause those perform the best. Relationship advice is hit or miss. Edit it down cause people's attention span is like 5 seconds. Generate the voice, make the avatar talk, edit in CapCut, add subtitles cause nobody watches with sound apparently, post around 7pm.\n\nCosts:\n\nAPOB: $14/month\n\nElevenLabs: $22/month\n\nCapCut Pro: $10/month\n\nTotal: $46/month\n\nNot bad but it adds up.\n\nMost of my income comes from brand deals honestly. TikTok payments are inconsistent as hell. Some months it's $200, some months $400. Brand deals are more reliable, usually $300-400/month.\n\nHere's where I'm stuck.\n\nOne, I'm running out of good stories. I've gone through every top post on AITA from the last year. Now I'm scraping through random subreddits and most of it's garbage. Where do you even find good stories at this point? I tried confession and tifu but they don't hit the same.\n\nTwo, my views have been dropping for like 3 weeks straight. I don't know if TikTok changed something or people are just tired of this content. Some days I post 3 videos and they all die under 10k. It's frustrating as hell.\n\nThree, last week someone commented \"isn't this just stealing people's stories\" and now I can't stop thinking about it. I put credit in the description but I honestly don't know if that's enough. I've seen some accounts get taken down. Is this even legal? Like technically it's public content but I'm making money off it so I don't know.\n\nFour, the avatar looks weird sometimes. Especially the hands. I've had people call it out in comments. I don't know if I should try to fix it or just ignore it cause most people don't seem to care.\n\nOne video I did about this wedding drama where the bride uninvited her sister got 240k views. People were in the comments arguing for DAYS about who was wrong. That's when I realized controversy is everything. But I can't predict what's gonna be controversial.\n\nMy girlfriend thinks this whole thing is dumb but she can't argue with the extra $700 lmao.\n\nI want to keep doing this cause the money helps but I feel like I'm one algorithm change away from this whole thing disappearing.\n\nHas anyone else done something like this? How do you deal with views randomly dropping?\n\nAlso where do you find content when you've burned through the obvious stuff?\n\nAnd does anyone actually know the legal situation with using Reddit posts? I keep seeing different answers.\n\nI'm probably overthinking all of this but yeah. That's where I'm at.",

To your point that you give credit; there is no way for the writer of a reddit post to actually gain anything but upvotes (from the 1 out of 20 people who will actually look into that user) by simply tagging their username.  I'd have found it more insulting than anything tbh when my content was stolen if the creator actually admitted 'Yeah this random reddit user put in the work, but I am looking to make cash from it.'  \n\nWhy don't you try specific TV show subs, or r/fantheories and such?  \n\n&gt;TL;DR:    \n*Ppl love learning deep lore, or coherent theories on shows that they like.  I myself have watched many game of thrones videos which go into the finer points (which is why I should have realized I could have made money off of my content to begin with).  This may be an avenue which you could try, though it may be saturated already with all the low hanging fruit already harvested.*  \n\nI wrote a long post about a Dexter theory on there a few years back, spent hours reviewing episodes for relevant quotes and everything.  It got a lot of attention with almost a thousand upvotes, and sat at a 99% upvote ratio.  I only did it to kill time and do something I like to do; write long posts for ppl to engage with.  \n\nIt came to my attention after that someone had taken some of those clips from the show, and basically narrated the video verbatim from my post.  My post was clearly the inspiration for the video, and they used huge chunks of my writing in their narration.  This video was at like over a million views by the time I saw it.  I felt robbed and used.  \n\nGranted, if I were smarter, I guess I should have just made the video myself to begin with.  I wasn't thinking about money though, just providing interesting content on reddit.  To this day I am resentful that some asshole basically took my content and made money off of it; what kinda pisses me off more though is how low effort that was.  (Yes, editing a video takes skill and time, but once the actual creative thinking part is done for you it's not hard to turn it into \"revenue\".  \n\nI spent a lot of effort to make that post, expecting nothing in return except maybe some agreement/discussion of my theory.  This guy, just copy pasted my shit, cut some clips up and turned my efforts into his money in probably less time than I used editing the grammar through drafts of my post.  It feels shitty to be on that end.  Though again, it's my fault for not having the foresight to know it'd be stolen, and not trying and monetize my efforts to begin with I suppose.  \n\nAfter I watched the video, I started getting a ton of recommendations for similar videos which present theories on TV lore, most of which had millions of views.  So if you are going to do this, I suppose that's an angle to try to pursue as well; though it's already saturated.  To avoid repeating other videos; maybe start digging into the lore of newer TV shows rather than ones that have been speculated on for a decade already.  \n\n&gt;*You seem to be mindful of the \"stealing\" aspect of all this, so I am simply giving you a point of view from someone who has been stolen from in this way.  At the end of the day, again I should have known it would happen regardless and either have done the video myself or not even bothered to post the thread.  I can't really be mad that someone saw a chance I did not to make money from something I put out for free, but yet I am resentful.*",

I think I have a couple good original ideas and then I also think I could just do aita etc and then think who would want to watch that or me WHILE watching aita YT videos with creators overlapping themselves with similar stories.   \n\nI even think I found a 130ish video series I could do but run into my own walls again WHILE fully knowing that multiple others have done at least a couple topics off the list that I’ve personally watched. \n\nSo this is definitely a me problem with a failure to just start. \n\nThird, in regards to further content for you, Reddit is full of content but maybe try your hand at some TT FYP Drama 🎭, or police body cam, or shit a lot of the YTers don’t even make their own compilations but just leech onto another compilation created and then just react to their compilations so now it is their “own content”(?).

I am not a professional web developer, but did study it a while ago, so have a bit of background.\n\nI was so impressed with the output, that I thought it could be a tool that other people would use. I bought the domain [www.dryoutside.com](http://www.dryoutside.com) and starting sharing the link in a few places on reddit. Within the space of 24 hours, my website had racked up thousands of visits and I started getting people using my \"buy me a coffee\" link on my about page (which I was surprised about, as I thought it was kind of hidden).\n\nFast forward a few weeks and my website has been picked up by multiple websites and newsletters and is enjoying a global audience, with money trickling in via the buy me a coffee page.\n\nNot enough to go full time with it, but I am impressed that I've been able to spot an opportunity to generate some money from an idea within such a small space of time!",

      "selftext": "so this wasnt planned at all but figured id share since it might give someone ideas. I got into drones about 2 years ago just for fun, mostly filming my weekend hikes and local spots around Portland. Posted some clips on instagram and this small real estate agency hit me up asking if they could use one of my neighborhood shots for a listing. I said sure and charged them like $50 thinking that was fair\n\nfast forward and now i have 6 local businesses (3 realtors, a wedding venue, and 2 small hotels) that have me on retainer for $150-300/month each. Theyre basically paying for access to my footage library that i keep updating. I spend maybe 4-5 hours a month flying around getting new stuff and the rest is just them downloading whatever they need from the shared drive I set up\n\nthe best part is i was gonna do this hobby anyway. I had some money saved up from Stakе for a better drone and just reinvested the first payments into upgrading my equipment instead. now its covering itself plus giving me around $1200-1400 extra monthly without much effort",

YT takes a few days to process everything, but have had huge growth since starting.\n\nIs a mix of long and short form content (10% / 90% split), with both getting significant views. The short form promotes the long form, which in-turn promotes the watch-time growth.\n\nWas super simple too, so more than happy to help anyone.\n\nHave done this before with other channels, so now kind of trying to see new niches and give people my notes (can share to anyone, but not sure if Reddit allows) (maybe I'll post on my personal how to do it).",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone thought i would do a little AMA. I’ve been making my living online for well over 25 years and just thought I’d give some time to answer any questions you have about the topics I’m familiar with. \n\nI have multiple passive online incomes from websites like travel blogs to social media sites, to AI Youtube channels. \n\nMy social media site basically runs on auto pilot there’s plenty of members who have been on the site long enough for me to give them privileges to ban people who try to abuse the site with spam or whatever. The site makes revenue off premium memberships. You can pay $10 a month to access more features. \n\nMy travel sites and other informational websites did take years to build but it pays off at the end, even small tourist towns travel guides sites get 50k-100k views a month and they tend to get high RPM around $6. But that’s only $300-$600 a month so you can’t live off just one site. I target what’s called “evergreen” content basically meaning content that’s always going to be useful. Unlike content that needs to be updated everyday. \n\nI have a software website that i developed automation software for repetitive tasks for an example scraping tools etc. The software is subscription based on average $10 a month to $99 a month. This is basically passive besides updating or improving the software from time to time. No advertising just ranking on google for keywords. \n\nI have a YouTube channel that I use AI to make videos, currently gets about 10 million views a week with 85k subscribers it’s not exactly passive income though because I believe soon as I stop posting the views will drop…. I literally make the videos while on the toilet most the time while most people scroll the videos on the toilet I’m making them so I’ll call that passive LOL. \n\nI have a 3D printing eBay business this is passive but you need a wife who ships the products but long as you have that, get a 3D scanner and a printer and start scanning everything we sell a lot of replacement parts for everything from your cars cup holder to your ovens knobs to toys. You also can make this completely passive with some print on demand sites I’ve heard but never tried. We don’t make enough profit off each sale so I don’t think a middle man service would work for us but it could for your products. \n\nBut anyways free to ask away and maybe I can answer some questions.

      "selftext": "I hesitated to post this because I don’t want it to come across as a “look at me” thing. But when I was starting, I read a lot of posts like this quietly in the background, and they helped me stay sane. So here’s my experience.\n\nTwo years ago, I started an online service business from scratch. No audience, no personal brand, no capital, no insider connections. Just my laptop and phone. It’s a pretty unsexy business, mostly operational, mostly behind the scenes.\n\nIt’s an online, service-based business that helps small to medium companies solve operational capacity issues. We sit somewhere between staffing, operations, and process support. We are based in Australia.\n\n**Year 1: Reality check**\n\nThe first 3–4 months were nothing but rejection.\n\nNo clients and fuck all momentum. Just cold outreach every day and checking my inbox way too often. I seriously questioned whether I was just bad at this, or whether the idea itself was flawed.\n\nWhat made it harder was that from the outside, nothing was “wrong”. The offer made sense on paper. People understood it when I explained it. They just weren’t buying.\n\nEventually, one client came through. Then another. Then another. Growth was slow but real. I was primarily using cold outreach and typically landed 1–2 new clients per month.\n\nBy the end of year one, the business was doing roughly \\~$200k annualised revenue.\n\nSounds fine, but the reality was:\n\n* I was doing *everything* myself\n* I couldn’t switch off\n* Any problem in the business was my problem\n* Time off meant revenue anxiety\n\nMargins were decent, but I had essentially built a job that required constant attention.\n\nA typical day looked like:\n\n* Morning: outbound outreach and follow-ups\n* Midday: onboarding or solving client issues\n* Afternoon: fulfilment work\n* Evening: admin, invoicing, documentation, hiring\n\n**What didn’t work in year one**\n\n* I tried to “work harder” instead of working differently\n* I delayed hiring way too long because I wanted to save money\n* I over-customised for early clients instead of standardising\n* I said yes to the wrong clients out of fear\n\nA few things actively hurt progress:\n\n* Underpricing early to win deals\n* Letting one early client consume a disproportionate amount of attention\n* Avoiding hard conversations with poor-fit clients\n* Confusing activity with progress\n\nMost mistakes came from operating in survival mode.\n\n**Year 2: Thinking differently**\n\nYear two was when things actually changed, but not overnight.\n\nThe biggest shift was how I thought about the business. Instead of asking “how do I do this better?”, I started asking “how does this work *without* me?”\n\nI spent a lot of time studying operators who think in terms of:\n\n* Offers\n* Leverage\n* Throughput\n* Systems\n\nThen I applied those ideas to my own boring, service-based niche.\n\nPractical changes:\n\n* Opened multiple acquisition channels instead of relying on one\n* Hired people to fulfil delivery and admin\n* Documented processes I used to keep in my head\n* Focused heavily on retention and client lifetime value\n\nRevenue per client averages around $1.5k–$3k per month, so growth didn’t come from huge deals. It came from consistency, retention, and not breaking under load.\n\nBy the end of year two, the business is sitting around \\~$800k annualised revenue. The team is now 4 people, and for the first time, I’m not the bottleneck in every decision.\n\nBy year two, the daily routine changed significantly:\n\n* Morning: review key metrics, sales pipeline, delivery health\n* Midday: team check-ins and unblocking issues\n* Afternoon: system improvements or hiring\n* End of day: thinking time (offers, pricing, structure, constraints)\n\n**What surprised me most**\n\n* Boring businesses scale better than exciting ones\n* Consistency beats intensity every time\n* Most growth problems are actually people or systems problems\n* Confidence comes *after* evidence, not before\n* The business grows when you stop trying to control everything\n\n**If I were starting again**  \nA few things I’d do differently:\n\n* Hire earlier, even if it feels uncomfortable\n* Say no faster to bad-fit clients\n* Standardise before trying to optimise\n* Focus on one offer and one ICP for longer\n* Expect the first 6 months to feel pointless\n\n**Final thoughts**  \nI’m still quite far from where I want this business to be.\n\n$800k annualised doesn’t feel like an endpoint. If anything, it’s just the first stage where the business starts to feel structurally sound. There are still plenty of inefficiencies, things that rely too much on me, and areas that would break under real scale. I have much bigger plans for the next year, but I’m also very aware that growth doesn’t come in clean, predictable lines.\n\nIf there’s one thing this experience reinforced, it’s that progress is often a sludge. Long stretches where nothing exciting happens, where the work feels repetitive, where you question whether you’re actually moving forward at all. Most of the meaningful improvements happened quietly, without any sense of momentum at the time.\n\nLooking back, the biggest gains came from continuing to show up during the least rewarding phases. Not when things were exciting or validating, but when it felt boring, frustrating, or slightly pointless. That part doesn’t get talked about much, but it’s where most of the separation seems to happen.\n\nIf you’re early and it feels slow, unglamorous, or heavier than you expected, you're honestly probably on track lol",

It took a while for me to work out what my business was going to do but I think I've found my place in the market. I started the business working at the kitchen table, using my wife's laptop when she wasn't using it.\n\nIt's taken a lot of work for me, especially with a family with three kids and the arrival of number 4 art the beginning of last year. \n\nIn my first year, I worked myself into the ground. I worked day and night. I lost count on the number of all nighters and the lack of sleep was killing me, and having no money with a family to feed, so I just worked longer hours. I wasn't a nice person to be around.\n\nIn my second year, I cleaned up my sleep hygiene. I went to bed when I put my kids to sleep but I would wake up at 4 am to start work at my desk at home. I got some more wins on the board. \n\nNow entering my third year, I've told people that I  probably wouldn't start this business again. It's been too stressful and killing me. \n\nWhen starting a business, people don't realise how much work is involved and the risk you're taking. I knew I had an uphill battle to climb and I put every ounce of effort to make it work. I kept telling myself that 99% of people would have quit but the 1% of people who are successful keep pushing and working hard to win. They push themselves outside the comfort zone.\n\nI'm still solo and avoiding hiring people. This is by design. \n\nI hope this inspires other people who are looking at starting their own business or they are grinding away to one day be successful. \n\nRemember to work smart, have a clear picture of your goals and ask yourself if what you are working on right now is moving you closer to your goals!",

Staffing company finds an engineer and pays that engineer $75-$100 hour for the work and pockets the rest.\n\nNow, depending on how OP is qualifying his revenue:  he's either starting he's grossing $800k a year on contract hires: which would mean his gross profit is $200,000 -$400,000 before he pays his support staff.\n\nOr his gross profit is $800,000,\n\nOr his net income is $800,000.\n\nAfter only 2 years of business, scenario 1 is most likely and honestly still very fragile.  However scenario 2 is definitely possible within the staffing world, essentially 20-40 contract hires in our scenario.\n\nSo while everyone is calling out bullshit, it is very possible to do what he is doing.\n\nOP, while I'm certain you're very proud of what you're building it is important to remember you're 2 years in.  Business life is a lot like dog years, you're at the knowledge of a 14 year old.\n\nYou're also posting in a passive income sub that has an incredible amount of BS AI posts that are geared to get people to buy a BS product.

The kids were great. The parents were...not.\n\n2. Asked everybody I knew if they had any potential jobs or work they needed done. I ended up with a weird mishmash of housecleaning, lawnmowing, babysitting, in-home computer repair and setup, bookkeeping, ghostwriting, and package shipping jobs. The package shipping ended up being pretty great--it was for a lab that sent out test kits. Ghostwriting also brought in some decent money.\n\n3. Started an eBay store selling jewelry and accessories. That brought in $2,000-4,000/month after a few months. I started it with about $500.\n\n4. Wrote and self-published books. That brought in over $100K one year, but it wasn't consistent. I'm trying to replicate that again now that I no longer have a corporate job and have more time.\n\n5. Got hired by a content mill. I wrote 10,000 words a week for them in SEO-optimized articles. It was a grind but paid my adult daughter's medical bills.\n\n6. Started a plant nursery on my property 10 years back as a side hustle. It currently brings in $25K in April-May. I'm expanding to farmer's markets and online sales this year.\n\nPretty much what I did each time is take stock of my skills, no matter how trivial, and see if people would pay for them. I also factored in what I love/hate and that ultimately led me to writing and selling plants. But along the way, I did a lot of less enjoyable stuff. I actually enjoyed housecleaning and other physical work, but I kind of hated dealing with people in their homes. Now I deal with people on my property, but hanging with plant people outside is very enjoyable to me.",

Back in 2013, dumpster diving had not caught fire on Youtube yet, so many corporate stores did not take precautions. I walked up to a dumpster that had several thousand dollar's worth of discontinued hair sprays. I sold most of them quickly for up to 50 dollars a pop. Seems like I scored near 50 of them. They sold rapidly, because the product had recently been discontinued. And this is also a lesson, if you can source discontinued cosmetic items that people still want, they have high demand and you can make bank. An example of this today is Nautica Competition cologne. Many of us have a bottle or two sitting in an attic from the 90's. They discontinued them and they sale good even today if still fresh. But anyways, dumpster diving is a great way to begin selling on eBay. Just make sure everything is clean and nothing is broken. Always be careful and look for hazardous waste, needles, etc. It is a gray area, so try not to get caught or you could be trespassed. But say if you were a security guard or maintenance worker at a mall overnights, with no one around, you could probably score lots of things to resell while making a normal job paycheck as well, and it would not be trespassing then. I remember I also found tons of Vic Secret NWT lingerie items that had been returned. The store was supposed to cut them up and toss them, but never did. I made thousands on that dumpster as well. And while I am on memory lane, there was a Sports store that tossed 100's of shelf pull baseball hats and trinkets that I sold, and also a Williams Sonoma store that tossed new steel frying pans, cooking machines, and I even scored something like 20 new in can recently expired gourmet coffee beans from them, and also a new with tags Japanese Santoku knife I sold for over 100 dollars. Those were the good ole days for me, which began my passion for treasure hunting.",

Anyone legit will comment publicly.\n\nFor actually earning online, tbh the \"never do 9 to 5\" thing is kinda idealistic when you're just starting. Most online income takes time to build up. Surveys are flexible and you can start immediately. I use a bunch of different ones and make around $300/month, not enough to live on but it's something while you figure out a bigger plan.\n\nIf you want actual sustainable income, you kinda need to pick a skill and get good at it. Freelance writing, video editing, web development, graphic design, whatever. Then use Upwork or Fiverr to find clients. But that takes months to build up to livable income. The people making real money online either spent years building it or had capital to invest upfront. Just being real with you so you don't waste time chasing get rich quick stuff.",

          "body": "You’re already in a strong position for 23. With solid savings, HYSAs, and index investing, the biggest wins now come from staying consistent and growing income over time. Be cautious about adding complex or risky investments just to “do more.” Focus on maxing tax-advantaged accounts, keeping things simple, and only branching into things like real estate or side businesses if you have a real interest or edge.\n\nFor your HYSA, I’d advise keeping it focused on liquidity and stability, not squeezing every last basis point. The HYSA should act as a safe parking spot for emergency funds, short-term goals, and money waiting to be invested. I personally use a tool like Bank Truth to compare savings rates to make sure my emergency fund earns something while I invest. Make sure it’s FDIC-insured, easy to access, and has no fees. It’s okay if the rate moves over time. What matters is that the cash stays accessible, earns reasonable interest, and doesn’t tempt him to take on unnecessary risk.",

      "selftext": "[Original post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/comments/1q1hbl5/1200_in_the_last_three_months/)\n\nSo, I was finally able to automate the entire process ( would have finished faster if I wasn't lazy ) &amp; the entire thing has been working decently well. There are definitely some glaring issues, but I'll continue bug fixing as I go along.\n\nOne interesting thing I noticed is that the bot actually takes less trades &amp; i think its due to the lack of that human element. The bot doesn't get those \"gut feelings\" it sticks strictly to its data &amp; parameters. This isn't a bad thing, but there were a few instances the bot ignored while adhering to parameters, that I would have jumped at.\n\nI'm not sure I can code \"emotion\" on the bot &amp; I think doing so may ruin its edge. This is all ramble anyway as I don't have nearly enough data to make a conclusion. Maybe I'll do another update in 3 months to determine idk.\n\nOn my last post there were some of you who asked how I built it, mine is custom coded, but I did say I'll try to find a no code alternative for you guys.\n\nI did find one &amp; took the liberty to try to build out as much of the workflow as I could. Before I dive into it let me just say that if you really want to make custom workflows, learn to code. It was actually harder ( for me ) to build this cause these no code editors have quite a few constraints you don't get coding.\n\n[Regardless here is the workflow](https://www.gumloop.com/pipeline?workbook_id=fn8cXAevPdxcJLPoMyuTfy). I forgot to add a trigger, but in my defense the entire thing was pissing me off so i could focus. ( don't bully me please )\n\nDO NOT under any circumstance use the stupid Ai chat builder thing, i think gummie is the name. It will break the entire workflow. You are better off experimenting &amp; trying different things yourself. Also I'm sharing this workflow as I'm sure one of y'all can improve it &amp; make it infinitely better than I can.  \n  \nHopefully I've covered everything, if not, if I make an update to the update then I'll cover anything I may have left out. As usual feel free to ask any questions. ",

          "body": "YouTube has been pretty good for me, not entirely passive but between ad revenue and affiliate income I make around $1200 a month with about 50% of my views each month coming from my old video library. \n\nI’m not a huge fan of survey apps but do use 1Q, Google Rewards, and Meta Viewpoints. 1Q is usually only 1-5 questions and pays between $0.25-$1.50 per survey, the main reason I like it is every survey pays and it pays right away via PayPal (DM me if you want a referral link, referrals pay me $0.25 as well). Google rewards usually has surveys based on your search history and pays $0.15-$0.75 per short survey with a low threshold for payouts ($2.00). Finally Meta Viewpoints rarely has surveys but when they do, they are almost always $5-$10. They are all small but don’t have a bunch of qualifying surveys that don’t pay and have made a few hundred from them. \n\nAs far as true passive income, I try to put some of the money I earn from the other stuff into dividend stock portfolios that pay monthly (Mainly SCHD, JEPQ, DGRO, Main and O). I reinvest the dividends every month for now so I can continue to grow my dividend income in the future.\n\nI occasionally try out other side hustles but nothing super consistent.",

      "selftext": "last year, i was sending 100+ cold emails a day to local businesses with bad websites. reply rate? maybe 2%. most of them never even opened the email. i was spending hours crafting messages, following up, and getting nowhere. it was demoralizing.\n\n\n\nthen i had an idea. what if i could show them a working demo of their own website, personalized just for them? not some generic link they’d ignore. something they’d actually watch. so i built a system that does exactly that.\n\n\n\nfirst, i set up a website template that pulls all its info from a google sheet. business hours, services, prices, everything. if they edit the sheet, the website updates instantly. no developer needed. that part alone got their attention.\n\n\n\nbut the real game-changer was the video. i automated a 60-second clip that shows their google maps listing, the website i built for them (with their business name plastered everywhere), and me editing the google sheet live. the website updates in real time on screen. it’s like magic. suddenly, my reply rate jumped to 15-20%. people actually responded.\n\n\n\nhere’s how it works now:\n\n\\- every morning, a script finds 100-300 local businesses with terrible websites.\n\n\\- ai builds a professional site for each one, connected to a google sheet.\n\n\\- a video renders showing their business name and the demo.\n\n\\- an email sends automatically with the video attached.\n\n\n\ni spend 1-2 hours a day replying to interested businesses and closing deals. the rest runs on autopilot.\n\n\n\nthe setup took about 2-3 weeks. i had to build the website template, set up the google sheet connection, and automate the lead gen, video rendering, and email pipeline. it wasn’t easy, but it was worth it. now i’m making $500-800 per deal, mostly from plumbers, dentists, cleaners, and other small businesses where i can reach the owner directly.\n\n\n\nthis isn’t completely passive. i still have to handle replies, hop on calls for bigger deals, and troubleshoot if something breaks. but it’s way better than sending cold emails all day and getting radio silence.\n\n\n\nif you’re curious, here’s what i used:\n\n\\- a google maps scraper for leads\n\n\\- an ai website builder with api access\n\n\\- google apps script or make/zapier to connect the sheet\n\n\\- a video rendering tool (i use \\[tool\\])\n\n\\- a cold email platform\n\n\n\nmy advice? don’t automate on day one. test it manually first. find 10 businesses with bad websites, build them sites, record the videos, and send the emails yourself. see if anyone bites. if they do, then automate the boring parts.\n\n\n\nsome common questions i get:\n\n\\- \\*how technical is this?\\* moderately. you’ll need to understand apis and basic scripting. not beginner-friendly, but not rocket science either.\n\n\\- \\*how much should i charge?\\* $500-800 one-time works. some people do monthly retainers, but i prefer the one-time fee.\n\n\\- \\*is this saturated?\\* no. there are millions of local businesses with terrible websites. plenty of room.\n\n\\- \\*how long until it’s profitable?\\* about 2-3 weeks to build the system, then another 2-4 weeks to close your first deals. not a get-rich-quick thing.\n\n\n\nhonestly, this is a 6/10 on the passive income scale. it’s not “make money while you sleep,” but it’s “make money with 1-2 hours a day after building the system.” if that sounds good to you, i’m happy to answer questions about how i set it up.",

      "selftext": "I just wanted to tell you about a small side job that works for me. There are no complicated systems in this simple setup that is based on useful content and affiliate links.\n\nI run a small travel guide in my area. Not much. Mostly useful information: how to get to the airport/where to sleep/trips for the day or things that help you save time, money, and nerves.\n\nI also write articles for other travel blogs and guides. Sometimes I do this as a guest post, sometimes I get paid, and other times I do it just to get links back to my own site.\n\n\n\nHow I make money from it?\n\nMostly through affiliate links, but only to things that people need when they travel.\n\n**The platforms I use are (it's not affiliate links):**\n\nKiwitaxi: transfers to and from the airport and city, their affiliate program here [https://kiwitaxi.com/en/influencer/](https://kiwitaxi.com/en/influencer/) \n\nFor example, someone once ordered a transfer worth almost €1000, and I got more than €100 from it.\n\nAiralo eSIM [https://www.airalo.com/partner-with-us/affiliate-partner](https://www.airalo.com/partner-with-us/affiliate-partner)  \nthis one is especially useful\n\nTravelpayouts is basically a big affiliate hub for travel with a lot of travel brands.\n\nI dont use banners, no pushy calls to action. Only links that make sense in context in guides or on social media. I think that when users are already ready to buy a service, they start looking for promo codes. They don’t necessarily read my small blog - they find a promo code instead, and I still get a commission even without being a big blogger.\n\n\n\nReal numbers.\n\nIncome isn't steady:\n\nMonths with little business: €50-80. Good months: €100-400\n\nWhen do good months usually come around? When an article does well on Google and ranks well for relevant search queries.\n\nOr during the busy time. When someone makes plans for a trip ahead of time and then books it. That's the good part- some bookings don't happen until weeks after the click.\n\nWhat I like is that it works long-term: you write something once, and it can keep bringing in commissions.",

There are webinars to attend that last for hours, and they offer nothing anyway, as it's just someone reading through the guidelines; they don't actually show us how to do anything, like a walkthrough type thing, which would have really helped. Each certificate has at least 20 questions, and they are constantly emailing with different priorities and new updates to the guidelines. It is a complete nightmare, and I wish I hadn't passed that first test because I don't want to do anymore. I also asked about the rate, but was ignored. You only get paid for each certificate passed, and you have to reach 30 hours before you get anything. 😖",

You see it on this sub all the time: sites lost all their traffic because “Google update” and now suddenly they didn’t have anything else going on and are failing. \n\nTake as many sources of traffic as you can.

      "selftext": "When I first started looking into online marketing, I was honestly just trying to escape the 9–5. I didn’t really know who was legit and who wasn’t—I just knew I wanted out.\n\nI invested in a course that focused heavily on mindset and taught the basics of building a website. It even came with its own software as part of the package. On the surface, everything sounded solid: build a site, add products, and send traffic to it.\n\nWhere things started to feel unclear was the traffic part. The guidance was basically: post on social media, promote your links, and choose between organic traffic (slow but free) or paid traffic (faster but costs money). There wasn’t much strategy beyond that.\n\nI struggled because I didn’t fully understand how traffic actually works. Organic felt painfully slow, paid traffic felt risky, and I kept bouncing between different marketers hoping someone would explain it in a way that finally clicked.\n\nWhat I eventually learned is that traffic is the business. Websites, tools, and products don’t matter much if you don’t understand how to consistently get attention from real people. Once I stopped chasing platforms and started learning how each traffic source actually behaves, things made more sense.\n\nSharing this for anyone early in the process: confusion doesn’t mean you’re failing—it usually means you haven’t been taught the full picture yet.\n\nCurious what part of online marketing was hardest for others when they first started—traffic, mindset, or execution?",

While not in the ultra-high-volume category (50,000+ searches), this keyword demonstrates consistent, targeted interest from professionals, researchers, and healthcare organizations actively seeking information about AI applications in medicine.\n\n**Commercial Value**\n\n* Cost-Per-Click (Semrush): $5.41\n* Competition Level (Semrush): 0.5 (Low competitive bidding)\n\nThe moderate CPC of $5.41 suggests reasonable advertising costs.\n\nThe low competition value of 0.5 indicates that advertisers are not bidding heavily on this keyword, offering potential opportunities for paid search campaigns at relatively affordable rates.\n\n**Keyword Difficulty**\n\n* Keyword Difficulty Score (Semrush): 80 (Very High)\n\nThis reflects the dominance of authoritative, well-established domains occupying top positions, making organic ranking extremely difficult without exceptional content authority, comprehensive topic coverage, and significant link equity.\n\n# SERP Analysis &amp; Competitor Landscape\n\n**Top-Ranking Results Overview**\n\nThe current Google Search Engine Results Page (SERP) is dominated by authority websites and major technology corporations, with the following ranking positions:\n\nPosition 1: Google AI Health\n\n* Authority: Google (maximum domain authority)\n* Content Focus: AI's transformative potential in personalized, accessible healthcare solutions\n* Snippet Insight: Positions AI as a life-saving tool for medicine and healthcare transformation\n\nPosition 2: NIH PubMed Central - Peer-Reviewed Research\n\n* Authority: National Institutes of Health (.gov domain)\n* Content Focus: Comprehensive analysis of AI as a disruptive force in medical practice\n* Snippet Insight: Academic, research-backed content establishing AI's fundamental transformation potential\n\nPosition 3: ForeSee Medical\n\n* Content Focus: Practical benefits including faster diagnosis, improved treatment, and data-driven decision-making\n* Snippet Insight: Results-oriented approach emphasizing tangible healthcare improvements\n\nPosition 4: Coursera - Educational Content\n\n* Content Focus: Specialization programs for learning AI healthcare applications\n* Snippet Insight: Educational pathway, indicating strong interest in skill development\n\nPosition 5: OpenAI for Healthcare\n\n* Authority: Major AI company (published January 8, 2026)\n* Content Focus: Secure AI products for healthcare organizations\n* Snippet Insight: Recent, authoritative information on practical healthcare AI implementations\n\n# Related Queries &amp; User Intent Analysis\n\n**Primary Search Intent Categories**\n\n1. Application-Focused Queries\n\n* \"How is AI being used in healthcare?\"\n* \"AI in healthcare examples\"\n* \"Healthcare AI tools\"\n\nUser Intent: Users seek concrete, practical examples of AI implementation in healthcare settings.\n\n2. Industry Leadership Queries\n\n* \"Who is leading AI in healthcare?\"\n* \"Healthcare AI companies\"\n\nUser Intent: Competitive intelligence and identification of industry leaders and innovators.\n\n3. Specific Tool/Solution Queries\n\n* \"Which AI tool is best for healthcare?\"\n* \"Healthcare AI chatbot\"\n* \"Healthcare AI app\"\n\nUser Intent: Evaluation and selection of specific AI solutions for healthcare use cases.\n\n4. Career &amp; Employment Queries\n\n* \"Healthcare AI jobs\"\n\nUser Intent: Career opportunity research in the AI healthcare sector.\n\n5. Product Verification Queries\n\n* \"Is there a health version of ChatGPT?\"\n\nUser Intent: Seeking information about consumer-facing AI health tools.\n\n# Content Type Distribution\n\nThe SERP displays a diverse content ecosystem:\n\n1. Authoritative Brand Resources: Google, Microsoft, Oracle, OpenAI official pages\n2. Academic &amp; Research: NIH PubMed Central, Harvard publications\n3. Educational Platforms: Coursera specializations\n4. Industry Analysis: McKinsey strategic insights\n5. Company-Specific Information: Individual AI company homepages\n6.

How is AI being used in healthcare?\n2. Who is leading AI in healthcare?\n3. Which AI tool is best for healthcare?\n4. Is there a health version of ChatGPT?\n\n# Search Behavior &amp; Trends\n\n**Recent Activity (January 2026)**\n\n* OpenAI announced Healthcare solutions (January 8, 2026)\n* Harvard Gazette published AI regulation discussion (January 12, 2026)\n* ChatGPT Health features announced (January 14, 2026)\n\nThis recent activity indicates the keyword remains dynamic with continuous innovation and news coverage.\n\n**Related Search Interests**\n\nThe keyword demonstrates strong association with:\n\n* Specific examples and case studies\n* Company and competitive information\n* Tool/solution evaluation\n* Job market opportunities\n* Educational content\n* PDF resources and comprehensive guides\n\n# Ranking Difficulty Factors\n\nThe keyword difficulty score of 80 is driven by:\n\n1. Authoritative Domain Monopoly: Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and NIH occupy top position.\n2. High Page Volume: 1.24 billion indexed results create extreme competition\n3. Broad Topic Coverage: Every SERP result covers healthcare AI comprehensively\n4. Recent Authority Content: Established sites continually update content\n5. Semantic Relevance: Multiple related keywords (applications, companies, tools) fragment search intent\n\n# Strategic Recommendations\n\n**For Content Creation**\n\n1. Niche Specialization: Focus on specific AI healthcare applications (e.g., \"AI in Radiology,\" \"AI in Drug Discovery\")\n2. Comparison Content: Create detailed comparisons of specific AI tools\n3. Case Study Development: Document real-world implementation examples\n4. Thought Leadership: Publish original research and unique insights\n5. Video Content: Develop visual explanations and demonstrations\n\n**For Keyword Targeting**\n\n1. Long-Tail Variations: Target specific applications and use cases\n2. Question-Based Keywords: Focus on \"How to,\" \"Why,\" and \"What\" questions\n3. Company-Specific Keywords: Target individual AI company names\n4. Technology Stack Keywords: Target specific AI technologies (LLMs, computer vision, etc.)\n5. Job/Career Keywords: Capitalize on employment-related searches\n\n**For Paid Search**\n\n1. Moderate CPC ($5.41) presents reasonable advertising opportunity\n2. Low competition bidding allows for cost-effective campaigns\n3. Target high-intent keywords (tools, companies, specific applications)\n4. Focus on healthcare industry professionals and researchers\n\n# Conclusion\n\n\"Healthcare AI\" represents a highly authoritative keyword with moderate search volume (2,400 monthly searches) and significant commercial value ($5.41 CPC). However, the keyword difficulty score of 80 reflects extreme ranking challenges dominated by technology giants and authoritative institutions. The SERP composition indicates that users seek comprehensive, authoritative information spanning applications, market leaders, specific tools, and career opportunities.  \nSuccess with this keyword requires either:\n\n1. exceptional authority and content comprehensiveness for organic ranking,\n2. niche specialization in specific subtopics, or\n3. strategic paid search investment at reasonable costs.\n\nThe keyword remains highly relevant and actively updated, making it a valuable long-term target within strategic healthcare AI marketing and content strategies.\n\n**Semrush Data Referenced:**\n\n* Search Volume: 2,400\n* CPC: $5.41\n* Keyword Difficulty: 80\n* Competition: 0.5\n* Results: 1,240,000,000",

These folks needed someone patient who understood that every item has a story and you cant just toss everything. They also needed help deciding what actually has value vs what doesn't, how to sell stuff on facebook marketplace (most of them have no clue), and someone to physically do the heavy lifting.\n\nStarted offering this super specific service in my area. \"Downsizing assistance for seniors\" basically. I help them sort, list valuable items online, coordinate donations, and handle the actual cleanout. Charged $35/hour which felt fair and I had a little money saved up from Stakе so I could test it without stressing about immediate income.\n\nFirst client came from my moms friend. Then word of mouth exploded because apparently every boomer in a 10 mile radius is dealing with this. Now I'm booked 3 weeks out and averaging around $4k/month working maybe 20 hours a week. The crazy part is how many of their kids are willing to pay me to do this because they either live far away or dont have the patience.\n\nIm wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?",

When I sold my Grandma's house in 2016, I went down there for a week and loaded up a trailer with the valuable items or things I thought I'd use at home. The rest of the house was evacuated by a team of some 5 laborers who bagged/boxed up clothes, linens, books, etc and brought them to their warehouse. It took them maybe half a day to tie up loose ends. From there, the business model was simple. Once a month, this business would hold a public auction that went from like 7am till 9pm. Lots of similar items from different estates would be placed in this enormous warehouse/outdoor space and people would come through and make offers on items (or just buy outright for a fixed price). Throughout the day, at different time checkpoints, the price would be reduced by 25% until the last few hours of the day it would be 75% off. At the end of the day, all unsold goods were landfilled or donated. \n\nIn terms of making money, the contract was set up where I owed the company $1,000 no matter what and 25% of net revenue of sold goods. They ended up getting around $3,000 for the miscellanea of her house so I only owed $250 above what they got from the sale. They also set me up with a contractor/realtor to get the house minimally ready for sale.\n\nI'm not saying you need to scale it that large, but that's how that company was able to provide families with some peace of mind that the entire house wasn't just going in the trash.",

You operate in a unique space of being able to come from outside and handle the downsizing/listing of items. For example, if you, a stranger/expert come and tell them that this item should be listed and is worth ~$20, they might accept your word for it while if their son or daughter comes and says the same thing, they might argue and tell them they're wrong. \n\nI deal with the same thing with my family all the time. I did my degree in computer science and economics. I work in tech. My parents are academics (researchers at a uni). They will argue with me till they're blue in the face about systems I've literally worked on because I'll always be their son and kid in their head, but if one of my colleagues said the same thing as me, they'd accept it as expert testimony.\n\n&gt; Im wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?\n\nI mean, it's a specialist version but you have a lot of parallels. You should think about what exactly makes up the core parts of your profession and how it differs from other similar, overlapping industry professions. From there, you can figure out a)where to hire from, b) how to hire, c) what needs to be taught, and d) how you continue to refine that niche. It can totally scale. (and as others have said, $35 an hour is less than what I pay just for regular cleaning ladies to come dust my place every week lol. You also have to keep in mind if you take outside help, your prices need to scale so you make your cut and can also handle other things like equipment, liability, etc.. At least in LA, I pay $50 an hour pp (e.g. $200 for 2 hours with a crew of 2) and that feels fairly standard/not the lowest budget but certainly not high end. So yeah, $35 for specialist help? Not surprised to hear that it's popular).",

Credit card saved for processing and if you bid and won, it was yours.\n\nIf I recall correctly, you had to agree that you could pick up the goods on the specified pickup date during a set of hours. This allowed the company to arrange all pick ups of goods from the house on one single day. They'd only have to worry about what didn't sell.\n\nIf a customer didn't make it to pickup between the set hours on the pickup date, the goods went to second place in the auction for an arranged day, and you were charged anyway.\n\nI think each lot had an easy minimum set, like that Sports Stuff example would start at like $6.\n\nWas pretty awesome.",

If that bothers you (I know the feel), grandfather in the people who your current clients refer to you after the rate change, or grant those referrals a reduced rate special for the first X hours or something.\n\nScaling something like that is tricky. The reason you're so successful, and distinguishing yourself from what's out there, is your emotional intelligence and empathy. That can be recruited, but not really realistically taught on an employee-training timeline. I wouldn't try to make this a big company with many agents or anything like that.\n\nThat said, with careful consideration and selection, you could probably justify expanding to a very small team, and perhaps dividing up labor would be efficient as well, like having someone to list things for sale, someone else to do hauling with a truck, whatever of that nature comes to mind for you based on your operation. Or each person could just take on the full scope of services, and the team just divides up clients. You have lots of cool options for helping people in your area, hooking up one or two or a few other people with a good job, and making your business easier on yourself. But yeah, I think if you try to expand very far beyond a smallish company in your particular city/region, it would probably succeed, but probably also lose a lot of the real core value being provided (that being the compassionate shepherding of people through a difficult life transition). Only you can decide what your priorities are.",

You operated within a legal framework someone else created.\n\nThe rugged individualism myth erases all the invisible support that enabled your \"solo\" success.\n\nNobody builds anything truly alone. But admitting you had help doesn't fit the narrative entrepreneurs want to sell.\n\nYou had family money for startup capital. You had connections from your expensive university. You had a safety net if things failed. But the story becomes \"I started with nothing\" because acknowledging privilege doesn't inspire people to buy your course.\n\nWas on my couch last night playing grizzly's quest while reading another \"self-made\" success story on my laptop. Every sentence ignored the massive support system that person had. Partner who paid bills during the lean years? Never mentioned. Parents who let them live rent-free? Erased from the story.\n\nThe myth is harmful because it makes people think they're failing when they need help. That asking for support means you're not a real entrepreneur.\n\nSuccess is collective even when one person gets the credit.",

          "body": "I'm curious what you'd like to see happen instead.\n\nSo I totally understand that often people say solo, but there's a lot going on behind the scenes, so it can be a bit misleading when people say that.\n\nI think a lot of people do oversell success and undersell support/time/effort it took to get there as a way to make their success seem bigger. In particular ignoring early family investment, or initial connections that lead to first sales. This is not healthy (for future entrepreneurs; for society, I don't know) to create an image of entrepreneurship that is too far from reality. It's like filters on instagram and what it does to beauty standards.\n\nBut if you are trying to say that society should take credit for the achievements of the individual, or parents should take credit.. I think that pushes it too far.\n\nWe absolutely should recognize the people in our lives that supported us on our journey, and that (depending where you live) that a stable structure around you was helpful, but support does not mean doing the work and actually taking the risk.\n\nThere have always been entrepreneurs, in every kind of society, so that can be omitted by default - it's not helpful and not actually a form of modesty.\n\nEven when absolutely NOT solo, very often it's 1 person that was the main force behind success. I had no family investment or support, am not married, and had no connections for my business. I put in my life savings. I did bring on some people to share the work over the years, but none invested their life savings, and all eventually gave up while I kept going. Now I'm doing pretty well. Did they help? Yes. But did they bear the same burden I did? Not even close. I personally wouldn't sell this as a solo founder journey though (although my next startup I will).\n\nBut I have a feeling this is not about entrepreneurs that built real businesses, but more about people selling snake-oil style courses?\n\nI imagine most will agree that it's annoying and likely a general bad for society. But it will always be here. Maybe you can invent some software that can help consumers make better decisions.",

The “I built this alone” narrative often resonates because it simplifies complexity into a story that’s easy to tell. It doesn’t reflect reality. Most successes are built on networks of support, systems, mentors, community infrastructure, and the ecosystem that makes opportunity possible.\n\n\nThat said, there’s also something to be said for the personal agency in execution. Two people can have the same resources, but only one might put in the sweat, iteration, and discipline needed to move an idea forward.\n\n\nI think the record should show both elements: acknowledge the support that made a thing possible AND the individual choices that drove it over the finish line.\n\n\nCurious, for people here who do talk about having built something “alone,” what do you think that phrase is trying to communicate?

You’re entitled to that self-view, of course, but it doesn’t mean you’ve achieved moral superiority or more inherent value than someone working in a factory. Even when it’s 100% true and nobody has ever helped you - what good does it serve you to say it or identify with it? Being here in the comments, or with your friends, or even with other entrepreneurs saying, “I built all this with no help” - what is the value? \n\nReal question: is the value the motivation from the dopamine hit of pride/self-esteem? I could definitely see some value in that. To me, it seems more rooted in identity which is all a game we play, alone, in our heads. I’ve met pompous entrepreneurs and incredible, inspiring entrepreneurs - I don’t think this did-it-alone-mindset produced the successful ones, but a lot of the community here seems pretty defensive of it and attached to it. None of this is meant to be rude or condescending - genuinely curious about perspectives.",

For example, if you have an assistant, a bookkeeper, an accountant, someone baby sitting your kids, any type of help, I don’t consider that self made. Did you know that majority of new business have to close down because of health insurance? Having good health insurance as self employed is necessary. \nIf you have a partner that takes care of the household, that is help. If you can afford to outsource, that is no longer self made. \nIf you can work 100 plus hours on your business, your entrepreneurship journey, how do you have time to do anything else?\nHave you tried working on a business while still trying to maintain a part time or full time job and have to take care of a household all on your own? The problem is, everyone tells you, you just have to work all day and night, just focus on your business. \nBut they never tell you the help they had. We are not made to make every decision on our own. I have a great example of a guy I knew that, even though he had a great support system that put him to the peak of his success, everything started crashing down when he stopped using his support system. \nIf you do not have a good support system, having no support system is better than a bad one. \nI’ve learned that trying to manage everything myself, I can’t do it alone. Now I’m learning how to outsource. I wish a “self made” entrepreneur would point this out in very simple words. \nThere is no such thing as self made. You can come up with an idea on your own, but the execution might not be great on your own. And if you want to grow your business, okay you’re saving money by doing it on your own, but time is money. I rather outsource than spend way too much time on something that I can pay someone to do it better than I can.",

The logic says I should use these tools to compete with the big companies. But every time I try to scale my outreach, I just feel like I am polluting. The thing is, if you send 1000 emails and get 0 replies, you are not doing sales. You are just annoying people.\n\nI decided to stop with the extreme automation.

It feels like swimming against the current when everyone else is on a motorboat.\n\nBut when I actually find friction and I talk to the person, they answer. They answer because they realize there is a human on the other side, not a script.\n\nMaybe the \"big fish\" can afford to burn their reputation with spam.

Nothing flashy, just something I thought could actually turn into a real business if I stayed consistent. I have some money saved up, so I wasn’t risking rent or groceries, which made me feel like I was being “responsible” about it.\n\nWhat I didn’t expect was how much mental energy it would take. Every decision feels heavier than it should. Pricing, timing, whether I should launch now or wait, whether I’m overthinking or underthinking. I’ll make a choice, feel okay about it for a few hours, then start questioning if it was the wrong move.  \nThere are nights where I’m sitting on the couch playing on myprize, not even working, but my brain is still stuck on the business. Wondering if I should’ve done something differently that day, or if I’m already messing it up without realizing it. It’s not burnout exactly, more like this constant low-level pressure. The funny part is, when I talk to friends, they think it’s exciting. And it is, sometimes. But a lot of it just feels lonely and uncertain in a way I didn’t really anticipate. There’s no one to tell you “yes, this is correct” or “no, that’s a bad idea.”\n\nFor those of you who’ve been doing this longer, does that part ever get quieter or do you just get better at living with the uncertainty and trusting your own decisions?",

You learn from failures and learn even more from successes (success is where you get patterns you know work, and can now remix those patterns to the next thing).\n2. You learn how to make the chaos transform into insight and actual information about the product and businesses you are building. You learn things like pretotyping, lean startup, Osterwalder’s 3 fits, MVP, and a wealth of other ways to reduce your risk and accelerate your learning. And maybe most of all you learn that there’s this thing called the customer. Wonderful source of insight and knowledge on what works, what they are willing to pay for and how. Much of chaos goes away when you go to the customer with decisions you would need to make, and get their input on the choices. Or just use design thinking as a strategy: really listen to the customer, empathize with their situation, and learn heavy from it. Learn to ask questions like: “I have a legally binding purchase order here for my product, it’s 75,000$ would you sign it right now?” And when they don’t sign it, asking “what would it need to have to for you to sign it right now?” And then you listen very carefully what follows.\n\nThere’s even a literal science to this.

It's been verified, legitimately verified with my attorneys, and someone even made him a go-fund me.  I'm still recovering.  \n\nLawyer up now.  At least have them on standby if need be.",

Make use of professional legal services, a lawyer that represents your interests only. They can also have a lawyer. Don't share lawyers. This is a business matter, act as a professional.\n\n2.

Just like in 2008 I see there is this combination of loss of jobs and new startups launched, and this is expectable. In the next couple of years it will only speed up, we will see more solo founders, more people trying to launch a business, and more failure stories. What's different is the scale of making new things: it's so easy now to launch something small, not very data-savvy, and of course it needs AI in it.\n\nOversaturation is coming our way with a crazy speed, many founders price their services cheaper and cheaper, and we all know where it leads. Someone sees it works, repeats, sets the price lower.. It's like a downward spiral we are rapidly moving into.\n\nJust in the last couple of months I heard founders pith one and the same idea in different variations about 10+times, it starts looking like a \"Groundhog Day\" of ideas!\n\n  \nI am very excited about physical products and unsexy startups I'm advising, since at least they have a better chance to stay afloat. Especially devices, robotics, everything linked to meds / personal care, or even food. These have a better chance of a successful exit.\n\nJust Friday thoughts of an elderly person, would be glad to see what are your observations.",

But for someone like me who is doing a multi country ug programme @ tetr college and actually running a D2C brand, nothing feels passive. You’re constantly dealing with shipments, customers, suppliers, creatives, inventory, and tomorrow’s problems. Even when things look “stable,” your brain is still working in the background. There is no passive. There is only **active now** and **active later**. Most so-called passive income is just income where the hard work happened earlier. During the building phase, it’s never passive. The moment you stop paying attention, something breaks, ads drop, suppliers slip, customers churn, platforms change the rules. Honestly, the only income that comes close to being truly passive is rent from real estate, and even that isn’t fully hands-off unless you outsource everything. So I’m curious.\n\nIs there any other income that’s genuinely passive? Or are we just dressing up delayed effort with a nicer name? What do you think?",

So that's really cool!\n\nExternally, it has benefited us a lot as well since we bet on optimizing to get cited by LLMs and AI tools like ChatGPT early on and this has resulted in a lot of customers finding us via these tools! We noticed it's often easier to get cited here over traditional SEO since that landscape is super competitive and companies with the most money usually wins!

Biggest wins: code review assistance (catches things humans miss at 2am), documentation generation (nobody likes writing docs), and customer support automation for common issues. The real impact wasn't cost savings though - it was speed. Shipping features that used to take a week now takes 2-3 days because the boilerplate work is faster. The catch: prompt engineering is a skill. Our team spent weeks figuring out how to actually get useful output consistently. It's not plug-and-play like the marketing suggests. Still worth it, but required real investment to make work.",

We built a triage system that now handles about 60% of incoming volume autonomously. Our team went from drowning in repetitive questions to actually solving complex problems and building relationships with customers.\n\nOrder tracking automation saved our ops team around 5 hours every single day. Just eliminated all the manual status lookups and update requests. Sounds boring but the time savings compounded fast.\n\nLead generation might be the wildest ROI shift. We went from $200/month on traditional tools to like $10/month with AI workflows doing better work. The targeting got more precise because we could iterate and test way faster.\n\nThe bigger shift has been cultural though. Once people on the team see AI handle the grunt work well, they start spotting more opportunities themselves. That momentum is probably worth more than any single automation.\n\nWe've had plenty of things fail too. Not everything works. But the stuff that does work has become essential to how we operate now.

          "body": "From my experience talking and consulting to many founders and entrepreneurs, I believe, the most useful skill set isn’t something fancy or trendy. It’s a small group of very human skills that compound over time.\n\nFirst is **learning how to learn**. Markets change, ideas fail, and assumptions break. Entrepreneurs who survive are the ones who can admit “I was wrong,” learn fast, and adjust without ego.\n\nSecond is **basic financial sense**. You don’t need to be an accountant, but you must understand cash flow, margins, and how long your money will last. Most businesses don’t die because of bad ideas but because of cash quietly runs out.\n\nThird is **selling and listening**. Not pitching listening. Real entrepreneurs hear what customers actually say, not what they hope to hear, and then shape the business around that.\n\nFourth is **emotional control**. Some days feel like you’re winning the world, some days like you’ve ruined your life. Being able to stay steady, make decisions without panic, and keep going matters more than motivation.\n\nAnd finally, **patience**. Overnight success is usually ten years of boring work. If you’re okay with slow progress and small wins, you’re already ahead of most people.\n\nYou can learn tools anytime. These skills take time but they’re what really carry you through.",

Access to your business Facebook page is connected to your personal Facebook account. It's against the TOS to maintain more than one personal Facebook account. When you say \"have separate emails\" for all your accounts... how does that work? They've specifically designed their systems to require a business owner to link all their accounts to a single personal profile. You're potentially more at risk of being flagged if you try to maintain several personal FB accounts each attached to a unique business page.",

Consumers are upset that AI content is being pushed on them... Where the \"magic\" of content is that it is created by humans for humans. AI detatches the human from the creativity of consumed media in any form.\n\nPersonally I go out of my way to avoid content that is generated by AI because it feels inauthentic. So do a lot of others, and it's not a great look when consumers actively go out of their way to consume your products.\n\nI expect AI to thrive in areas where complex static computing often fails. Recognition, manufacturing, decision making, and tooling. I expect AI to fail on anything media related. Unfortunately an absolute shitload of investment and usage is in media generation. It will collapse, and from the rubble will rise the actual consumer usecase... Just like the internet bubble.",

      "selftext": "Hi folks. We aren’t the typical SaaS company as we offer wet cat treats and are based in Canada and US. We already launched in Europe (starting with Spain) and our current setup is this: \n\n\\-We already have a local payroll provider\n\n\\-We have a local accounting firm\n\nBUT, it is becoming too hard to continue this way and I will list the reasons below: \n\n1. We are concerned that we are overpayng some taxes \n\n2. We’ve noticed many frequent mistakes from both payroll and accounting providers\n\n3. Salary miscalculations and Incorrect payslips every other month\n\n4. Some issues managing employee medical checks\n\n5. And on top of this, VERY slow replies and poor English support (I guess, you get what you pay for- and in Spain apparently, English is not so used). But we learned the lesson the hard way so we are now looking for alternative local providers in Spain.  \n\nPlease let me know if you have any good EOR companies in mind that could help us fix the above. Ideally a provider that provides both the payroll and accounting services in Spain, but any suggestions are welcome!! Thank you! ",

I see some other redditors are suggesting you global EOR providers, but honestly, if you are worried about overpaying taxes, these big providers won't help you optimise absolutely anything.

I'd go with local providers (that speak English though!) because they will actually allow you to legally save some money on taxes and mandatory contributions.

Repeated payslip errors and slow replies are red flags, not “Spain being Spain.” Same with medical checks falling through the cracks. Someone should clearly own that. Local payroll plus local accounting often breaks down once you’re a foreign company. The two vendors don’t really coordinate, and when something’s wrong, you end up chasing both. That’s usually where the frustration comes from. If you want fewer moving parts, an EOR can help. The main upside is accountability. One provider owns payroll, taxes, compliance, and admin, so you’re not stuck mediating. I haven’t run Spain myself with Remote People, but I’ve heard solid feedback from HR managers who did. Mostly about things being calmer month to month, fewer mistakes, and faster responses. Not perfect, but better than juggling locals. So yes, it makes sense to rethink the setup. Ask any provider very directly how they handle errors and response times. That’ll tell you a lot.",

      "selftext": "So I’ve worked at a small waffle and coffee shop for about 3 years. It’s a small operation in downtown of a large city. The owner recently offered to sell me the business for $65,000. His reasoning is that he wants to free up capital to put into another business he’s scaling, and he feels comfortable passing this one on to me since I already run much of the day-to-day. They’re hardly there in person at this point, maybe once a month or every other month to collect the cash. We’re located in a small food hall under an office building, so there’s a constant supply of costumers from there. Not enough to keep our numbers where we want, but it helps make sure we’re never actually dead I think. We’re also located right by the theatre district so whenever there’s ballet shows or operas it guarantees some traffic. The rent is also taken by the food hall as a percentage of our sales so whenever it’s slow we don’t get hurt too badly. Another factor maybe worth considering is that we partnered with Starbucks, so we buy their products and can sell them, something he already paid the license for.\n\nSome numbers:\n\n•\tMonthly sales usually fall between $5k–$7k per week. Highs of 8k+\n\n•\tAverage month is around $30-35k. Busy months can get close to $40k, slowest (usually just January) is around 25\n\n•\tHe claims the business nets about $3k–$4k in profit per month\n\nWhat I’m trying to figure out:\n\n•\tOn the surface, does a $65k asking price sound reasonable given those numbers?\n\n•\tWhat specific documents should I ask to see before even considering this seriously?\n\n•\tWhat questions should I be asking about expenses, lease terms, debt, equipment, etc.?\n\n•\tWhat are common things first-time buyers overlook in situations like this?\n\nI’m not rushing into anything — just trying to educate myself before I say yes or no. I appreciate any insight from people who’ve bought or sold small businesses before.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEdit : I’ve seen it brought up and forgot to mention originally, but equipment is rented from the food hall so we don’t pay for repairs.\n\nThis was a bit of a passion project originally for the owners, but they’ve been too busy with their other jobs and their family to dedicate the time theyd like to it. I have a great relationship with them and consider them friends at this point. All the other owners of the stalls in this food hall are personally here most if not every day, but it’s been a point of pride for me to manage this place without them needing to be here. We have a small team but everyone’s awesome and covers whenever needed\n\nThe 3-4k profit would be after all expenses, including my current wages and inventory. There’s also ways to save money, for example they spend a ton on delivery for ingredients since theyre too busy to go to the store themselves.\n\nAlso this is not a franchise.",

          "body": "First off, everyone here is right about the lease. I see you said it's a food hall, they and malls are notorious for jacking up rents based on foot traffic increases so make sure you see the actual lease you are committing to and ask if it is a flat rate or \"percentage\" lease. Given you stated that the equipment is provided I have a gut feeling your rent will be percent or per sale based in whole or part. The equipment rent is weird to me, if not bundled in the lease you need to know the exact costs associated with it. Same goes for the rest of the FF&amp;E, utility share, etc... There are hidden costs all over with a business like this and everything from your cups to your water bill can impact your profitability if the costs go up even slightly. \n\nSecond, owners do sometimes step away from cashflow generating businesses at a modest sum, but this is the exception NOT the rule. Anyone operating an absentee or near-absentee business successfully and profiting from it is unlikely to sell at a low cost and typically seeks a higher multiple due to the low effort required to operate and high cost of them to replace that recurring revenue. Be open but skeptical (you are on the right path asking what to request from them). Ask them casual questions like what they're going to do with all of the free time they have. Answers like retirement or traveling are often acceptable (especially if they are older) but if they don't seem to have any idea there's a good chance you have something lurking they are worried about. A good example right now is single owner liquor stores. As alcohol sales decline and rents increase, many of these are selling at a low price trying to exit the market and pivot to something else rather than lose everything. Think about it from all angles you possibly can. \n\nThird, when a business owner tells you they make $3k to $4k in profit each month you should ask if that includes their cashflow (or owner draws / owner pay). If it doesn't, that means that you'll personally take home this amount or about $48,000 pre-tax if you hire someone to replace you (add in your current income if you can do it all yourself). If it does include their owner draws  /cashflow it means you'll make less than this and need to find ways to support yourself while building the business. You're in Washington with no personal income tax but you will need to collect sales tax and pay the Business &amp; Occupation (B&amp;O) Tax if I'm seeing this correctly. I'd investigate the taxes being paid now and if there are any changes slated for the future as part of the due diligence since the total profit is quite low.",

          "body": "Let’s say $3K/month net, so $36K/year profits.  Most coffee shops sell for 2x to 3x seller’s discretionary earnings.  That gives a valuation between $72K and $108K.\n\nSo the price seems OK, but you need to factor in add-backs and takeaways.  So if, for example, one owner does the accounting for free and you are going to have to pay for it, take that away from profits.  If the shop pays for the owner’s kid’s cell phone, add that back into profits.  Also, you have to account for any tax shenanigans, like off-book pocketing of cash sales.\n\nIf the owners are putting in very little effort, and it is netting $36K a year, there is some value being realized.\n\nNormally, I would say an opportunity like this is ideal for a seller-financed deal.  You have leverage, as the person who runs the shop day to day.  You leave, he has a burden, which puts you in a negotiating position.  But it sounds like he needs the capital, so he might not be willing to finance a sale.  Usually something like 50% down and remainder from cash flow over 3-5 years is viable and forces the owners to stand behind their profit numbers - no earn out as promised, no payment.\n\n10% net profit is top-quartile earnings for a coffee shop.  They are very finicky though in terms of business model, so you need to model this shop in a spreadsheet and ask questions like “what happens if sales dip 20%?” and “What happens if the price of coffee beans goes up 50%?”  Inputs for coffee, like beans and dairy are among the most volatile commodities and small swings in price can make a 10% net disappear quickly.\n\nYou’d have to look for existential threats.  Is there a large development coming that will kill your foot traffic for nine months?  Is a major employer leaving the area?  Is office space vacancy climbing in the area?  Is the lease on the space ending any time soon?  Is the rent going up any time soon?  Are you on a bus route that is being rerouted?  Have health inspection reports been poor and the next failure brings a shutdown order?  Is there a new competitor opening up down the block?  Coffee shops don’t die from bad coffee, they die from lease failure, labour failure, and sudden loss of foot traffic.\n\nUltimately, buying a coffee shop is a lifestyle business; you are buying a job.  So if your current wage plus $30K or so a year in additional income makes that job attractive enough, it sounds like a solid buy.\n\nYou will want to ask for financial statements and evaluate all obligations like equipment leases.  It is not uncommon for a business like this to have basically no assets.  It is also not uncommon to owe a bunch to suppliers.  Income statement should show bottom line income and balance sheet should show asset values and any debts.  You are going to want to verify those financial statements against the businesses tax returns.  That will keep you from being duped.\n\nAs additional due diligence, you should have a lawyer review all commercial agreements, like lease, Starbucks, etc to ensure no concerns.  You’ll also want to make sure the deal is structured right given the entities involved.  Are you buying shares, are those shares unencumbered, is there tax liability that might survive the sale and fall on you, etc.\n\nAlso, any letter or offer should specify a working capital calculation method and amount.  Very simply, it is usually something like “Price is $75K and includes $10k or working capital. Working capital is calculated as bank accounts plus inventory plus prepaid expenses plus receivables minus accounts payable, minus accrued expenses minus accrued payroll minus accrued taxes”.  This protects you, the buyer, from any actions the seller might take to weaken your economic position.  Common things they can do: slow paying of bulls to increase accounts payable, deplete inventory, call in all outstanding receivables, clear out the bank accounts, process refunds in unsettled credit card transactions, etc.\n\nCash                = $8,000\nInventory           = $12,000\nPayables            = $6,000\nAccrued Wages/Tax   = $4,000\n\nWorkingCapital = (8,000 + 12,000) − (6,000 + 4,000)\n               = 20,000 − 10,000\n               = $10,000\n\nSo if the owner bleeds the business down to $5K and you have a deal set on a working capital of $10K, you pay $5K less for the business.  This keeps you from having to suddenly come up with another $5k in the first weeks of operation to get the business stable with enough capital to operate day to day.\n\nThe one other thing I would say you should look at with a critical eye is the equipment.  Fridges, espresso machines, etc, can all be very expensive and may be nearing end of life.  You’ll need a capital plan for that and need to make the depreciation of those devices is properly accounted for in the financials.  There would be no worse shock than buying this business making $30K a year and finding out that if the replacement of equipment was properly accounted for, it actually was losing $10K a year and now needs a $50K investment in new equipment that is about to reach end of life.",

If you can legitimately run it for a few years and then afford to hire someone to run it for you because the loan is paid and you have a stream of income that is worth considering. But to take a full-time job as a tiny coffee shop in a cafeteria is not a dream to aspire to, it's survival on a basic level.. So if it's useful to you as a stepping stone then maybe. This could be way more of a trap than an opportunity.\n\nWhat if you invest 3 years of your life and then there is a downturn or something that demands you work longer hours and cannot afford to pay anybody else. Now you are literally trapped. That means that every day working there is a day further away from your dreams. \n\nPure speculation but I believe bad business decisions, and going out of business is a lengthy process that takes away several years of a person's life. It's not like it happens in one decision on one day.  Things generally dwindle along for years with uncertainty before people pull the plug.\n\nIf it were me I would explore options to reset my mental framework. For example I would look for another opportunity to start the business in another location. And run through the numbers and then compare the two. Obviously that's a bit much for you at the stage but that is the very first thing that I would do. Then you have a mental comparison to evaluate it as an opportunity or not. When you have nothing, everything looks like an opportunity. When you have success, everything looks like a possible threat to your success.\n\nThe other thing is friendships do not hold water when it comes to money. People will do absolutely anything for money. To the words lie cheat and steal mean anything to you? Don't trust this person. Verify.\n\nI had a friend who was a young woman a number of years ago. She worked at a jewelry store and started dating the owner. He told her she needed to build up her credit and had her get about $60,000 worth of credit cards with which he bought inventory for the store. He never paid her back and destroyed her credit and completely screwed her over. She was like 22 at the time. So just don't trust anyone.\n\nOne of the first things I would do is investigate this guy's decision but that's going to be hard for you to do without business experience. I could have a 5-minute conversation with him and know exactly what's going on based on his responses as being seemingly true or false. That's hard for you to do. But that is your number one objective is true understanding of his motivation. One way that you can do that as a subordinate is to appeal to him with Emotion by having a saying you want to have a sit-down conversation and you've been thinking a lot about it but you're having a lot of concerns about getting trapped and having your life path misdirected. That will engage his emotions and he may reveal further details to you.\n\nI'll give you an example. When I was younger and buying inexpensive cars for transportation, after a complete inspection and review I would always ask one final question. I would say \"look I plan to get in this car and drive it across the country. If I was going to invest $1,000 what are the top three things you would consider spending it on for repairs?\" They would always always exhale deeply, think for a few moments, and then tell me the exact real actual problems the car had.\n\nSo you might say something like look I need this job to support my mother, or I want to have a family Within 3 years and I needed to support me. And then just see if you sense any emotional waffling from him.",

Managing a single business, let alone two is not easy - and liquidity for any early venture is like oxygen. \n\nNow here are some things to seriously do as next steps:\n\n• Get Access to The Balance Sheet, P&amp;L, and Income Statements.  These are huge to cross-checking the claims - and is the soul of the deal. (Please get a CPA to review with you)\n\n• Verify liability exposure (lease, debt, outstanding invoices). The documents above should cover this, but so many small businesses mismanage these. This is typically what will make or break a deal. \n\n• Try and negotiate down. If 65k was his first price, I’m sure there’s room for a sweeter deal.\n\nThere are other steps you should take, but these are the main 3 for a deal like this.\n\nAnyone who tells you to run away without even checking is foolish. You know the business first hand, it’s a relatively straightforward operation, and the price is pretty amazing.\n\nThe main question(s) for you to answer:\n• Are there any deal breakers that are influencing the price? (Typically hidden liabilities)\n\n• Can I see myself managing this for the foreseeable future and be adequately happy? \n\n• What growth opportunities are there to optimize the top-line &amp; bottom-line &amp; are is that juice worth the squeeze.\n\nThis is a trend across America right now.

A friend of mine used to own a sandwich franchise and he grew it to one of the top 5 stores by focusing his energy on promoting catering. Again, you can mention it to your regulars, put up signs, buy digital ads that target your zip/area code, etc.\n* Can you add another shift and operate as a ghost kitchen for evening and late night munchie delivery after the building closes? One of the benefits here is that you can start by trying it only fri/sat nights and if someone calls in sick then it's not the end of the world because the building is closed and you'll just show up as temporarily closed on the food app. Depending on what you have now, you might have to add a special oven that would let you do pizza, chicken wings, etc. You can go by a completely different name in the delivery app to avoid confusing customers.",

You need to do some due diligence. For example, some businesses took out adjustable APR loans during the pandemic that are now coming due... you need to see what kind of debt liability, if any, this business has and if it's assumable upon purchase. For example, I have a business local to me that did this, confident on growth projections, that is now completely underwater and desperate to sell. You don't want to be on the hook for a gamble/loss situation. \n\n\n\nAfter you do the financial due diligence, you'll want to consider the lease terms, if they are assumable and, if so, how long is left. What kind of increases are permitted, etc. If you get to this point, I'd strongly recommend hiring a lease attorney to negotiate caps (usually on annual percentage increases and CAM fees) for you. This would depend, of course, on if the lease is attached to the seller personally or his business, among other things. \n\n\nIf the business has some sort of agreement with Starbucks, you also need to determine what type of contract is in place for that, how much it is, and how long it is for. \n\nFirst thing first, though, get your hands on his Financials. \n\n\nETA: a fair asking price for most businesses is 4-5xs EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization). Seeing his P&amp;L and balance sheet will tell you if his asking price is fair. Doesn't mean you can't haggle or negotiate down, though. The low asking price is a bit of a red flag for me personally, but it could genuinely be that he is desperate for cash. \n\n\nAlso check out your local SBDC branch, as they often offer free business advising services.

You probably don't even need the name and location of the businesses if they'll give you the figures \"blind\" and offer to tell you more if you're interested.\n\nThis will educate you *a lot* as to what the market expectations are like for various levels of revenue, rent etc. If after looking at twenty coffee shops for sale yours looks like a bargain (25% or more less than expected price), find a way to make it happen. Vendor finance, silent partner investor, wife's uncle, whatever.\n\nIf it doesn't, maybe you're better off to buy another coffee shop for $40,000 that's being badly run. In hospitality among the best businesses to look for are the ones that are dirty and run-down in appearance (because you can clean up) and that are being run by an asshole (because you can be nice to customers) and are *still* making a small profit because the rent is low and the position is such that customers have little other choice than to go there. And make sure the equipment is reasonably good. Those factors together are a huge green flag. (WARNING: the asshole may be selling because they have heard a competitor is opening up. If there are already multiple competitors, this issue is probably a lot less important.)\n\nAnother option here, if the business is good (let's say worth $100K at market rate) but you personally can't come up with the money, is you offer to help the current owner sell it. You agree to stay on, work on increasing the value of the business enough to cover a broker's commission and lawyers' fees etc (figure maybe $10,000) and then when it's sold anything over $65,000 you keep, and you stay on as an employee of the new owner or go buy your own shop.",

Lol\nThere is no negotiation! \n\nIt's like going to walmart. It's not a flea market or garage sale so if the item is $59, you pay $59 for it or you don't buy it. \n\nThis is what people will end up getting if they are the ones trying to be smart, funny, entitled etc about a discount BUT the ones who I feel are sincere and just really had no idea it was going to cost that much money I have no problem  working with and often I give quite a considerable discount just because the people did the opposite of brushing me the wrong way. \n\nPeople that brush me the wrong way will get no discount and I don't even want them for a customer so I will send them on their way as quickly as possible.",

They don't really want the product but rather htan say it they'll just make something up(i do it all the time)\n\n  \na lot of people hate conflict. We can sometimes 'exploit' that but I've learned the customers who aren't interested and just are making up excuses aren't the best clients to have long term\n\n  \nthat doesnt' mean we shouldn't try to salvage deals and sometimes it may be a budget issue but normally if someone is interested in the product/service but the price is too high, they'll try to negotiate or say...can you do any better with the price?\n\n  \nin sales some are better at manipulating someones emotions than others. I'm not even really criticizing that. They work to make someone feel guilt over not buying. Years ago my father went on a sales call with someone who actually took out their family picture and said something like, 'do you want my family to starve? I know the product we are selling will work for you so just sign here so I can buy groceries'. \n\n  \nMy father wasn't all that comfortable in that situation but the salesperson he was with was a top producer.\n\n  \nmy point is a lot depend on if they really are oncerned about price or if they are jsut trying to find a way to say no politely . \n\nI see this more when I'm trying to sell an existing client something new. I have a relationship with them and maybe I'm trying to get them to spend some money. They act interested(maybe because we have built a relatinship over the years) but they'll try to find an excuse on why they aren't able to buy without making it personal. I don't guilt them over it\n\n  \nand when it comes to new prospects, I can typically tell fairly quickly if their expectations are set properly. I don't really work off a script so much but do know what to say in certain situations to try to find a way to close the deal. Maybe I should apply more pressure at times but my experience has been that when I really try too hard to close a deal where the customer isn't sure, they tend to be the ones I might have the most trouble with because if they feel a little pressured to buy, they will be more eager to find problems",

As (negative) example:  If you go to a restaurant and order a chicken sandwich w/o mayo, and they bring you a burger, then you complain and they quickly and nicely replace with a chicken sandwich with mayo, then you complain again and they quickly and nicely bring the correct order.  Restaurants initial perspective is they did supply what was requested in a responsive to feedback and professional manner....but the customer likely sees that situation as a failure (took too many tries to eventually fix).",

We both wake up around 4:30–5am,  leave the house around 7am, and the days don’t really stop until late at night. He’s still a technician in the field managing service calls and two techs. I handle everything else: phones, scheduling, billing, payroll, marketing, reviews, follow-ups, permits, subcontractors, networking, thank-you letters, etc.\n\nOn top of that, we have a blended family with rotating custody schedules, a toddler we co-sleep with (unfortunately), pets, and a household that I largely manage. I do the grocery shopping, cooking, laundry, homework, bedtime routines, appointments, and most of the mental load. We do have a house cleaner twice a month and someone who mows the lawn during the summer season, but day-to-day life still feels relentless.\n\nLately, I feel completely invisible.\n\nWhen my husband comes home, he checks out and doom scrolls on his phone while I scramble to get dinner, manage kids, clean up, and try to keep everything afloat. Tonight, during an argument, he asked me what I even do all day because he doesn’t understand why I don’t have time to move money between business accounts. That comment broke something in me.\n\nWe barely touch anymore. We co-sleep with our toddler, and the little intimacy that we do have feels rushed and more about his needs than connection. I don’t get compliments. I don’t feel desired. I’ve asked to be told I’m beautiful, and it just doesn’t happen. I put effort into showing I care, but I don’t feel it reciprocated.\n\nHe says he’s tired. I am too, but I still show up for him.\n\nWe argue more than we connect. I’m scared we’re going to lose our marriage trying to build this business. I feel lonely even when he’s in the house. Tonight he chose to sleep downstairs, even though we had the opportunity to be close, and that made it hurt worse.\n\nMy spark feels gone. I don’t feel seen, valued, or appreciated - as a partner, a woman, or a person. I don’t know if this is burnout, resentment, or the beginning of the end.\n\nIf you’ve built a business with your spouse:  \n• How did you divide labor without resentment?  \n• How did you reconnect emotionally?  \n• How did you stop feeling like roommates or coworkers?  \n• Or how did you know it was time to make a bigger change?\n\nI’m open to hard truths. I just don’t want to feel this alone anymore.",

Be direct with your husband: \"this isn't sustainable, and we're at risk of losing both our company and this marriage\". But, at that point, give him space to ponder things while you try to balance your spinning plates until the block of time arrives.\n\nThen, start with \"I love you\", and \"this isn't working for me, but I want to find a way to make it work for both of us\".\n\nMaybe you need a nanny/helper at the house.

But, clearly, there's not enough time in the day for everything, so it's time to get creative on what can buy you time. Including buying time together.

          "body": "Honestly, we realized that our marriage was more important than the business and one of us exited.\n\nIt’s easy to think that if you are partners in life, why not in business? In reality, it is a very rare couple that works well together. I mean, exceedingly rare. I have seen a lot more couples divorce after embarking on a joint venture than sustain it for years. \n\nHow is the business structured? Do you have a well defined role or are you just “helping out”? Do you get a paycheck? Because handling admin for a service based business is no small task. And if he doesn’t appreciate the work you put in, perhaps he should try hiring someone else to do the job. Then he’ll find out that no employee wants to regularly put in 12 hour days “because they care about the business”. They don’t care. After he runs through 3-5 of them, maybe he’ll have a different perspective on things.\n\nBottom line, takes a toll on your marriage. We tried to figure out a way to make it work for years but it was breaking me to have to manage my spouse. If there was tension at home it came to work, and vice versa. Our marriage still hasn’t really recovered and we were in a similar position, co-sleeping toddler too, when we started working together. Thankfully our child is older now but it was rough going for awhile there. You do lose yourself and that connection because you are just getting through the days. \n\nMy best advice would be to define everything about your role down to the last detail, look at a typical salary for your area for that type of position, and show him those numbers. It’s too easy to take someone for granted when the work they do isn’t quantified. But also, consider that a vast majority of couples do not work together or even work in related fields and there’s a reason for that. That much overlap creates friction and it’s not anyone’s fault, it’s the nature of the beast. Once I let go of the idea that we “should” be able to make it work it became much easier to look at the situation objectively.",

Somehow. Maybe a small ultimatum to make him turn his head and notice you, and all you are doing. Or perhaps “boundary” is better than ultimatum, I don’t know exactly what, perhaps you’ll be able to figure out something appropriate, being closer to the situation.\n\nIf we assume the best, that “everyone is doing their best from their current state of awareness” - then perhaps he just needs a little more awareness :)\n\nEDIT: wanted to add something I think is important here: extrapolating from my own life, based on the schedule you described, it’s not really surprising that you guys barely have time or energy for each other. That’s a nearly impossible situation. Working like that drains everything out of you and there’s just nothing left in the tank for intimacy or connection. \n\nI highly recommend that if this is what you guys need to do, and you’re making enough money, make sure you can get away for a night or two at least once a month, and at least one other date night or two each month. Getting out of that day-to-day situation is the only way you’re going to connect. Recently, my wife and I started trying to do a staycation / Airbnb once every two months let’s say. Makes intimacy way more desirable and likely",

I’m not saying he doesn’t work, but it’s fucking frustrating when I’m running on 4 hours of sleep and constantly running everywhere and he’s complaining about a mistake I made while on a walk with the dog or laying down. \n\nWe fight nonstop and I hate it.

One of the biggest shifts we made was realising that the home is another business. If we tried to run it like a “normal household” on top of running an actual company, we would have burned out completely.\n\nSo we outsource as much as we realistically can:\n\t•\tcleaning\n\t•\tlaundry / ironing\n\t•\tfood shopping\n\t•\tmeal prep where possible\n\t•\tlawn and outside jobs\n\t•\tsome personal admin\n\nNot because we’re lazy but because our time and energy are better spent on high-value tasks: in the business, in the relationship, and with our children.\n\nWe did the same inside the business. We invested early in admin and office support because growth (and sanity) required it. Trying to do everything yourself is a fast track to resentment.\n\nThat said — even with help, we’re still exhausted at times. This isn’t a magic fix.\n\nWe also have young children, and when I’m at home I want to be present with them. Not half-working, half-scrolling, half-thinking about what I forgot to do. I still don’t get the balance right but outsourcing the background noise of life gives us a fighting chance.\n\nWhat’s mattered just as much as practical help is alignment.\n\nWe regularly check in on:\n\t•\tAre we on the same page about where the business is going?\n\t•\tDo we agree on why we’re pushing this hard?\n\t•\tAre we both choosing this  — or is one of us just enduring it?\n\nWe take a full day once a quarter to map everything out — business, home, pressure points, capacity. It’s not romantic, but it stops silent resentment building.\n\nWe also talk openly about the pitfalls. Work will take over if you let it. So we’re very intentional about:\n\t•\tno-work-talk moments\n\t•\tno-phone time\n\t•\tactually being present with each other, even when we’re shattered\n\nWe co-sleep too, and I won’t pretend our relationship is top priority all the time. Sometimes it genuinely isn’t. This life isn’t rainbows and butterflies.\n\nBut we make a conscious effort to keep showing up imperfectly, but intentionally. We want to be successful and we want our relationship to survive this season.\n\nSo the question I’d ask: \n\nAre you aligned on where you’re going, why you’re doing this, and what support you’re allowed to bring in without guilt?\n\nIf the structure doesn’t change, the feeling you’re describing won’t go away — it will just harden. That doesn’t mean your marriage is failing. It means the system around you is overloaded.\n\nYou’re not invisible.\nYou’re not asking for too much.\nYou’re just carrying too much without enough support around you.\n\nAnd you’re definitely not alone x",

Some of them were natural phases of marriage that I think come along with raising children and being in a relationship for a long time. And I truly think we would have had most of those same struggles regardless of our careers. \n\nIn the business we have had gone through periods (like when our kids were young) that I took much more of a backseat and really limited my involvement as I focused more on the household. And then the pendulum has swung and now that our kids our school aged, my husband manages much more of the household (picking up kids from school, packing lunches, making dinner, etc), while I have gotten to step back in and be more of the point person and expert at work. It has been a really nice shift for both of us to have some role reversal and appreciation for what the other one contributes. \n\nSo although we struggle with all of the exact things you mention,  I think so much of this is a relationship problem. Running a business together can magnify these issues, but they would be there even if you had separate jobs. \n\nHaving a partner who can help share in not only the physical tasks, but also in the mental workload is huge. And although I am sure he is navigating his own burnout and struggles, from your side of things, it really sounds like he is dropping the ball, and the current situation is not sustainable. There is some great suggestions in here on the needed conversations.

I also built a company in a different field before getting into trades. Perhaps I can offer some insight. \n\n1. Trades work is grueling and dealing with customers sucks. It sucks the energy out of you. so your husband may need a little downtime after work and that's fair BUT not all night and doom scrolling isn't downtime. He needs to go do something productive for a half hour max. \n\n\n2. In my opinion, you're taking in the lions share of the work and your feelings are 100% valid. You need to share this post with your husband. Everything you said. And make a plan. \n\n3. I won't bore you to death with a wall of text so DM me for specific advice if you want. But you know you both have to work as a team. If he isn't good at handling the business side of the business (&amp; you can't expect yourself to keep doing it all) then you need to get some systems and process in place and automate as much of the back end stuff as possible. And if your husband thinks he should be making business decisions but can't handle the business side, that's a very real conversation that you gotta have with him. \n\n\n\nTrades businesses are tough. High overhead. Low net margins, lots of stress. Many fail out in the first few years and it's truly a mammoth effort to grow one to where you can be comfortable. \n\nAs I said above, feel free to message me directly for specific advice. I'm just another guy in trades. Not selling anything. Always willing to help out my fellow blue collar folks.",

My wife felt the same way, I worked 12 hrs plus a day to pay the bills, came home to hours in the office and yet I wasn’t doing enough. I never complained when she was to busy with the kids to make me a plate, I just did it for myself knowing she was busy. I always helped with the kids, dinner, bath time and getting ready for school. I even got up with the baby most of the time so she could sleep. And yet, just until recently when we spoke of this (mind you our new born is 13) she began to see that I did my part but somehow that wasn’t enough. I was in the trenches with her and yet it wasn’t enough.

You say you’re both busy and somewhat successful, but still feel like you’re constantly trying not to fall behind. That’s a classic trap for service business owners who haven’t raised prices enough to create the margin needed to hire help, systematize, and buy back time.\n\nNot trying to sell you anything — even though, yeah, this would be an easy pitch and maybe I’m off, but let me ask this…\n\nWhen’s the last time you and your husband actually sat down and talked strategy? Not just surviving the week, but real conversations like:\nHow can we be more efficient?\nWhat can we simplify or delegate?\nWhat level of growth would let us both work fewer hours and actually have time for each other?\n\nBecause without those talks, it’s really easy to stay stuck in survival mode — busy, tired, and slowly drifting further apart instead of building something that creates freedom.\n\nI learned this the hard way. My wife worked in the medical field and wasn’t involved in my business, but I tried to include her in my plans for growth and what that could mean for our future. She wasn’t interested, and over time she resented how much I worked. Back then I wasn’t making much, but we paid the bills, ate out sometimes, and took small trips.\n\nWe’re divorced now. She’s still in the same career and as dar as i know enjoys what she does. I went through years of struggle as an entrepreneur, but I never stopped having those strategy conversations — even when it was just me. The company that once barely made $75k a year was recently evaluated at ~$5M, and I’m pushing for eight figures next.\n\nThis isn’t about saying I’m worth more than my ex. It’s about showing how critical intentional planning is and the cost not being can have on a marriage. You rarely know exactly how you’ll get where you want to go, but if you’re not talking about it, defining it, and working toward it together, you stay stuck.\n\nAnd staying stuck too long turns into bitterness. Bitterness becomes resentment. And resentment eventually shows up as behaviors that damage both the business and the relationship.",

The world would still go around even if you dropped everything right now. You won't lose your house over it.\n\nYou first have to figure out which parts of the job you absolutely hate, and which are alright. The parts you hate have to be delegated as much as possible.

You can let go of social media and review responses. The largest sticking point of a client base is usually having a reasonable job done and any aftercare if a problem arises. They don't care if your Email response is 3 hours late. They don't care how you respond to their 5 star review. The business won't die.\n\nYour husband needs to delegate some tasks too, and reduce his workload. Did you know that rejecting some jobs \"because you are overbooked\" doesn't hurt your business? It simply makes you look popular. Alternatively, raising prices until some clients move away.\n\n\nFinally, discussing family time. Never Split The Difference has good negotiation tactics to get your feelings heard. \n\nThe problem with his \"Why can't you do this, what do you do all day?\" Is that he refuses to see labour he considers free/profit-less. If moving money is that easy, why won't he do it himself? It's because there's mental workload involved. It hurts you because you are drowning with tasks that he admits that it's impossible for him to do.\n\nYou both need more free time to open up the emotional capacity. Remember, you are not doing work he won't do, you are doing work he can't, and you are allowed to switch the off button.

I was working corporate but doing bookkeeping, marketing, business setup , change orders and Invoices - anything admin related I did. Then a year and a half ago my company did layoffs, so my husband was super energetic about me working FT for the business and how I’m the secret sauce. I was hesitant because I liked MY own paycheck but 3 months later we got married, 2 months after that January 2025 we got a puppy and that made me not want to physically leave the home. He’s a cavapoo and very clingy. My husband is all for this role. We have been way more successful (by the grace of god) by me working for our biz and we make more then my salary was bringing in.\n\n• How did you reconnect emotionally?\nThis is a good question. I am now pregnant with our first child and during the week “life happens” we both work, he’s on the field I WFH and handle all household operations as well as computer. He also though steps in ALOT and loves doing things for me… he’s always insisting on doing the dishes after dinner, never complains when I don’t feel like cooking, he’s super clean and organized as am I but we don’t have set roles. I do mainly cook dinner but since I’ve been tired due to pregnancy, he’s stepped up and made some great meals even after a hard day.\n\n• How did you stop feeling like roommates or coworkers?\nYou need to designate a weekend date night, make chores fun, even food shopping we love going together, get a babysitter and go out for a few hours just you 2. We don’t have much family here but thankfully my mother is nearby so alot of the time we even drop our dog off to her on Fri night and go out have fun and grab him the next morning and we will be doing that with our child as well. I’m sure there will be harder seasons for sure but maybe also try getting your kid out of the bed in the future so it’s just u guys again? \n\n• Or how did you know it was time to make a bigger change? If we’re out walking the dog we will catch up briefly on work cuz he’s on site all day so for me I call him for a 3 min convo or when he goes to store runs he always calls to catch up and see how my days going. Estimates and typing them always happen after work but we try to get them done one day a week. It’s tough but u both need to want to set boundaries and keep your marriage alive. One can’t want it more than the other. That man’s my homie, my best friend, working together is just a plus.",

No one really expects an immediate text back and you can text the person to schedule while doing something else.  \n\nAs for the marriage it’s tough.

For your husband it is time for him to step back or the pressure will literally put him in the hospital.  He needs to downgrade to just doing initial training, and administrative duties so he can actually enjoy life as the time lost just working makes this a job and not an actual business.

Last year was a scramble and I’m trying not to repeat that.\n\nAlso, every now and then we pay people outside the US (contractors/vendors), and that turns into another separate process on top of payroll.\n\nI’ve been looking at options and they all say the same things on their websites. We don’t need anything fancy. I just want something that runs payroll without drama and makes end of year less of a mess.\n\nIf you’re doing payroll for a small team, what are you using and would you pick it again?

It's as quick and easy as filing out a form (employee name, address, email, salary, etc) and the employee fills out a bit for themselves. And every quarter or end of year, there's a few reminders to look over some stuff, usually just for approval and you're good to go.

FYI, thats not how an auction should work.. I was the highest bidder, and there was no reserve. I have done some business with them before and would plan on doing it in the future so I prefer to be problem adverse, so I just said ok, you can wire me back my money. He says he will try to convince the seller to release it for that amount. About 3 weeks pass with me calling weekly until just over a week ago he says \"Sorry, I'm going to tell my boss to send you back your money\" (His boss is his dad). It's been a week and some change now and nothing. I tried calling him and his dad every day this week, left voicemails, no response, no callback. This is all very unprofessional and frustrating, at what point do I take them to small claims court or something else to get my money back? Any other suggestions?",

Did some digging and found out Chrome has a built-in tool that checks for accessibility issues. Totally free, takes like 2 minutes.\n\nRight-click on your site, hit Inspect, then find the Lighthouse tab up top (might be hiding under the &gt;&gt; arrows). Set it to check Accessibility only and let it run.\n\nI ran it on my site, expecting everything to be fine. Nope. Got flagged for a bunch of stuff I never would have noticed—buttons without labels, images missing alt text, contrast issues. Nothing that seemed like a big deal to me, but apparently it matters for screen readers and can be used against you in those demand letters.\n\nFixed most of it myself in an afternoon. Some of it I had to Google, but nothing crazy.\n\njust figured this might save someone a headache. Those ADA lawsuit letters are no joke from what I've read—settlements start at like $5k and go way up.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this stuff?",

      "selftext": "Hey Reddit,\n\nThis isn’t a post I ever thought I’d write, but here we are.\n\nA while ago, I lost my job. Not because I was bad at it, not because I didn’t care, and not because I didn’t try. I genuinely gave it my best. I grew, took responsibility, learned fast, and showed up every day trying to do meaningful work.\n\nAnd then it ended. \n\nWhat followed was months of job searching, applications, interviews, silence, rejections, and a slow erosion of confidence. If you’ve been there, you know the feeling: days start blending together, motivation becomes fragile, and at some point you quietly start wondering if maybe you’re just… not that good after all.\nThat part hit me harder than I expected.\nSo instead of staying stuck in that loop, I’ve decided to try something different — and honestly, pretty terrifying.\n\nI’m going to try to build a small company of my own. 💀\n\nI don’t have a safety net. I don’t have funding. I don’t have some romantic “always wanted to be an entrepreneur” backstory. What I do have is a background in digital content, UX, learning design, and product thinking — basically, turning messy ideas into clear, usable things that actually help people. I’ve spent years doing that for organizations. Now I’m going to try doing it for myself.\n\nWith little to no real business experience.\nThis subreddit (and Reddit in general) feels like the right place to do this, because it’s basically the collective brain of the internet — smart, skeptical, supportive when it counts, and very good at calling bullshit. I don’t want to pretend I have it all figured out. I don’t. That’s kind of the point.\n\nMy plan is to share:\nwhat I’m trying to build\nthe decisions I make (good and bad)\nwhat I learn along the way\nthe mistakes, doubts, small wins, and inevitable faceplants\n\nNot as a “guru journey,” but as a real, ongoing process of trying to take responsibility for my own life after it didn’t go the way I planned.\nIf nothing else, I want this to be honest. And if it does work — even a little — I want to be able to say I didn’t give up on myself when it would’ve been easier to do so.\n\nIf you’ve been through layoffs, career detours, or that quiet feeling of “I know I can do good things, why doesn’t life seem to agree?”, you’re not alone. And if you’re curious to follow along, offer advice, criticism, or just lurk… I’d genuinely appreciate having you here.\nI’ll post my first concrete step soon.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nYours truly, \n\nD",

      "selftext": "I’ve been running a handmade business for several years and I love the actual work.\nHowever, a small number of very difficult customers (aggressive messages, ignoring boundaries, constant pressure) has seriously affected my mental health over the yeats.\nI’m at a point where I’m questioning whether continuing is worth the emotional cost, even though the business itself works.\nHas anyone here closed or paused their business mainly because of customer behavior?\nHow did you know it was the right decision — or how did you protect yourself if you stayed?\n\nUpdate:\nI want to add more context because I realize “bad customers” can sound abstract.\nThis hasn’t been about a few rude messages or normal customer service stress. Over many years as a solo handmade business owner, I’ve dealt with a recurring pattern where a small number of customers escalated far beyond normal business interactions.\n\nI’ve experienced insults, verbal abuse, pressure, and threats. When I enforced boundaries or ended business relationships, some customers didn’t disengage — they escalated further. In some cases, they bypassed formal communication channels and used private contact details I never shared, including contacting me outside business hours and sending messages or letters to my private address. That crossed a line from “difficult customers” into something that felt unsafe and deeply distressing.\n\nThe cumulative impact of this has been severe: burnout, anxiety, panic reactions, and a loss of trust and joy in work I once loved. Being the sole person responsible — emotionally, legally, and operationally — meant there was no buffer, no team, no protection layer.\n\nI’m sharing this not to seek validation or business advice, but because talking about it helps me process what happened. Stepping back is not about weakness or giving up — it’s about protecting my mental health after years of repeated boundary violations.\nIf you’ve experienced something similar as a solo founder or creative business owner, you’re not alone. Sometimes the healthiest decision isn’t optimization — it’s distance.",

I had a short small mental break around 6 years ago from a particularly nasty review during the height of busy season. That combined with the customers messages just put me over the edge and I had to take a few days off to lower stress levels. \n\nI say all that to mention this: last year I silenced Etsy seller notifications on my phone. No more cha-ching. No more message notifications. \n\nI now only deal with Etsy when I'm logged in my computer and working (granted that's like 8-14 hours given the day, I'm still a sbo). It's made a huge difference in my mental health and being able to truly have a break from customers. \n\nYou can be grateful for success without being available 24/7 to shoppers. I just didn't really know or do that the first 8 years. \n\nMaybe try something similar before throwing in the towel should your business be a lucrative passion.",

In fact often times it’s cheaper to pay someone else to do things you shouldn’t be doing or aren’t good at. For example - doing their own books/taxes. Most people don’t even know what COGS means, of the ones that do few can tell the difference between a COGS and an expense. Unless you are an accountant (or a former one) then pay someone else to do it. And even if you are, it’s still not the best use of the time so I still suggest paying someone else. \n\n3) Biggest one I came to realize which admittedly kind of hurt and may seem a bit cynical: no one actually gives a shit about anything we’re doing or what it takes to accomplish the benchmarks. They don’t understand and they care even less than what they do understand. Our close friends and family may care about us winning, but they don’t actually give a shit about what we do. They may be interested and some may even enjoy having conversations about it, but whether we win or lose they won’t be losing any sleep over us.

Normally a house call to her area is $175.\n\nShe has contacted us twice to come back out to her home. We went both times free of charge and both times found nothing wrong. She was not taking care of the item in the proper manner and we advised her of that. We did not charge her for the stops, again we tried to toggle them on existing stops in that  area.\n\nToday she calls and is irate. She is screaming how she paid $450 and the item was not functioning correctly and she was insulted we suggested she was not fully understanding how to take care of it. She additionally started the conversation with \"don't make me take you to small claims court.\" I point out that she has a year warranty and that we generally never go to the customer's home, we did so prior to be helpful...no one is refusing to honor her warranty or assist. I advised that customers generally bring their item back to the shop if they are having issues and we can re-test, re-examine. She carried on she was not driving 30 minutes to the shop and I explained we have customers driving 3 hours to bring things to us. \n\nThis went on for a good 5 or more minutes of her making insults (ie, \"other shops could do a better job\" or \"you people don't know what you are doing\") before I simply said we are done for today, the options are to bring it to the shop or wait until we are in your area which may be a week or two. I advised her threatening, talking aggressively, or making insults is not going to engage us or encourage us to respond or help any faster. As we went to hang up I heard her say \"you bitch.\" \n\nI immediately called her back and informed her that I heard her comment. I told her she was no longer welcome to call our business. I told her I was not going to put up with her hostile and now verbally abusive behavior over something so trivial. I suggested she find another shop to help her (BTW, there is not one for at least 90 minutes). \n\nHave you had similar encounters and how did you handle them? \n\nAny thoughts on how the warranty is handled if you are no longer willing to see the customer due to their behavior?\n\nAs a small business, my other partner said \"great, now we just have to wait for the negative review.\" But my position is, why do we as a small business have to tolerate piss poor behavior from customers, why is it wrong to put your foot down and say \"no more, we are done\".....",

We regularly have people who don’t properly maintain their instruments (especially acoustic guitars in winter) and try to blame us. I’m polite and explain to them what we’re seeing and demonstrate proper care. But when a customer blows up on me like that, which luckily has been rare, they get fired. In most of those situations I refund them their money, it’s not worth the headache. Yeah I lose revenue, but the I look at it as paying for better mental health. I also blacklist them on our appointment scheduler so they can’t bring in any other instruments In the future. One of the other things I do is make sure every customer gets a follow up email encouraging them to leave a Google review. This has resulted in hundreds of 5-star reviews for us. The few bad reviews I’ve gotten I respond to directly, and put in a dispute with Google. Between the huge amount of 5-star reviews and a thorough reply to a bad review Google will usually pull the negative review down.

If you don't know why, you won't know what the right thing to do is. \n\nThe first question you have to ask is: is there a market for printing? What do you print? Is there daily demand for prints? From whom? How big is the demand? Who is currently filling that demand? Those are your competitors. \n\nResearch your competitors. Are the local, or are your competitors across the world. If some are local, go to their shops. What printing services do they offer? What are their prices? Do they make a lot of business from walk in customers? Or is it online? Do they have a web presence? How do they advertise themselves? How much do they spend on advertising? How much are total business expenses? How many sales per day? Per month? Is that a lot? For each printing business write detailed notes about the business. You need to do some math and figures out if they are making small profit or big profit. \n\nNow buy a small print service from each. Study how they greet and talk to the customer. Do they suggest other services? Do they suggest a discount for a larger batch of prints. How do they get the design? What are the terms of service? Redo, refunds, etc. \n\nWith this info, now you have to ask the tough questions. Can you offer the same printing services? Is there a way to improve the service to entice customers? If not, then can you decrease prices? Can you offer new services? Do you know where you can find new customers or create a new type of customer? If the traditional customer is businesses, then think about printing stickers, binders, folder, T-shirts, or temporary tattoos for children and parents. Lastly, can you advertise, and find new ways to be seen by your potential customer. \n\nNext ask, Which services bring in the most money? Why? Study that service carefully because you need to be the best and the best price at that service. \n\nNow about you: can you build such a business? Can you do it alone? Do you need to hire someone? Analyse you own business and ask what are all the costs of the business? Is it the printing itself? Or packing and delivery? For your prices, how many sales per month to pay for business expenses, pay taxes, pay for rent utilities, health, vacation, and food, and also have a little extra for the business so you can use it to improve  you services.  Is this a realistic number of sales? Are you getting than many number of sales? If not you need to advertise to your customer base, offer lower prices than your competitors. And you entire goal is to get enough customers for the price of your service. Which means marketing and advertising and finding your competitors customers, and new customers no one is using. \n\nAnyways hope that helps, good luck.",

Printing as a business is still viable, not dying. What is dead is generic, low-margin printing with no clear niche or differentiation.\n\nPrinting is still alive in packaging and labels, signage, business collaterals for SMEs (business cards, brochures, etc), custom and short-run prints, and event, school, or church materials.\n\nI don't wanna question the viability of the printing business. The real questions are: \n- Who are you serving right now?\n-  What specific printing problems do they pay for urgently? \n- Are you competing on price or on speed, reliability, and specialization?\n\nIf you’re open to it, it would help to know what type of printing you do, who your current customers are, and what’s eating up your cash flow the most. \n\nNot sure if it's allowed, maybe you can share your website or anything we can review or audit to somehow help you find clarity and tighter strategy, esp when capital is tight (otherwise, feel free to DM).",
