I’ve been doing it for years and it’s steady because businesses, schools, and organizations always need it. You don’t have to be in healthcare, and once you’re certified as an instructor you can teach on your own schedule. It’s not flashy, but it’s legit, flexible, and pays for a skill people genuinely need. I teach instructor classes if anyone is interested.",

With school and work being not too rough I’d say I have a lot of free time, and I am making a pretty meager salary for the area I live in. \n\nAre there any STEM grad students that have some good side hustle ideas? maybe tutoring or something? My coding is pretty limited to python/matlab so not sure how i’d fair with web design, but if there’s something else software related I could do with those languages I’m all ears.\n\nAlso just curious to see other people’s weird ideas if they’re in grad school, I’m a musician and have been busking a bit but it rarely covers more than the price of lunch (although it’s hella fun)",

For those who don't know, it’s basically an arbitrage model.\n\nThe Math: You have High-Net-Worth clients who want a \"Plan B\" passport (St. Kitts, Portugal, etc.). They pay huge government fees ($100k+).\n\n* The Real Estate/Legal Partners: These guys handle the actual filing and paperwork on the ground.\n* The Agency : I handle the client strategy and intro.\n* The Commission: Standard referral fees on a Caribbean file are $20k to $25k per family. EU deals vary but often hit €10k+.\n\nThe Pros: The margins are absurd roughly 90% because I have zero employees and no office. It's fully remote. I just maintain the B2B contracts with the lawyers and field the leads.\n\nThe Cons (and why I’m getting out): It’s a \"hunter\" business. If you aren't working the leads, nothing closes. It’s not passive recurring revenue (SaaS), it’s transactional \"eat what you kill.\"\n\nThe Lesson: I realized that while the cash flow is great for a solo operator, I want to build equity in a scalable product, not a service.\n\nI’m actually seeking to offloading my client assets and partner contracts to so I can focus on a new venture($50K)\n\nHappy to answer questions about how the CBI/RBI industry commissions work if anyone is looking at this vertical. It’s a bit of a \"black box\" industry so the unit economics usually surprise people.",

Same backend, different knowledge products\n\n**The result:** I'm generating way more value with less direct effort because the system coordinates opportunities instead of me manually connecting dots.\n\n**My question for y'all:**\n\nIf you're building knowledge products or running a solo business, which of these pain points hits hardest?\n\n* Your business tools don't talk to each other (data lives in silos)\n* You can't see your actual business health without pulling 5 reports\n* You're the bottleneck for everything because there's no system\n* You have no leverage - everything requires YOUR time\n* Your clients/audience don't collaborate with each other (untapped network effects)\n\nTrying to figure out if this problem is valuable to build as a product or if other creators would want to use/pay for or explore any of this infrastructure.",

          "body": "Hi. Interesting points. In my opinion, disparate systems should not necessarily be a problem. Each piece of software potentially has its niche, its strong points, and its drawbacks. The most important is that they have integration points, exposed APIs, at least, to allow you to build some automation. If not, time to move on.\n\nFrom a reporting point of view, again, different systems shouldn't hold you back in an ideal world. There are great (paid) BI tools that thrive on just this - bringing different platforms and systems together, to provide a holistic view. And in the absence of budget, it is totally possibly to build this yourself, in python, using some of the vast viz libraries.\n\n  \nOf course my comments are quite generic, vanilla. So DM me with some specifics. \n\n  \nData always live in silos, even in the best of systems and most efficient of companies. Different roles, rights, privileges. Pissing contests to get to the data, politics that prevent efficient management. So the fact that you at least have all access, god mode, is already a win in my book.",

Bought two refurbished machines for about $3,200, spent another $400 on initial snacks and drinks and found two spots to put them.\n\nFirst one's in an office building with around 50 people. That one does pretty well, usually brings in $280 to $350 a month. Second one's at an auto repair shop and it's more hit or miss, anywhere from $120 to $180. After buying inventory every month and gas to go restock them, I'm clearing maybe $130-150 profit. Not life changing but it covers my car payment so I'm not complaining.\n\nHere's the thing though - it's not as passive as people make it sound. I'm driving out every two weeks to restock, which takes a couple hours where i need breaks in between to play on myprize. Had to fix a jammed bill thing once that cost me $85. Someone tried to break into the one at the auto shop but didn't get anything, just messed up the lock a bit. The office building location is honestly carrying this whole thing. If I only had the repair shop one I'd probably be breaking even or losing money. I'm learning location really is the whole game here. Thinking about getting a third machine but I'm being picky about where it goes. Not trying to end up with another mediocre spot.\n\nAnyone else doing this? What kind of numbers are you seeing?",

I am not a professional web developer, but did study it a while ago, so have a bit of background.\n\nI was so impressed with the output, that I thought it could be a tool that other people would use. I bought the domain [www.dryoutside.com](http://www.dryoutside.com) and starting sharing the link in a few places on reddit. Within the space of 24 hours, my website had racked up thousands of visits and I started getting people using my \"buy me a coffee\" link on my about page (which I was surprised about, as I thought it was kind of hidden).\n\nFast forward a few weeks and my website has been picked up by multiple websites and newsletters and is enjoying a global audience, with money trickling in via the buy me a coffee page.\n\nNot enough to go full time with it, but I am impressed that I've been able to spot an opportunity to generate some money from an idea within such a small space of time!",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m Nicolas.\n\nI wanted to share how I went from being a baker making minimum wage to generating over $1.5 million in revenue. This is going to be long because I want to share everything: the strategy, the mistakes, and what actually worked.\n\nSo let’s go back in 2008, I’m 16, I dropped out of school in France to become a baker. The kind of job where you wake up at 4am, come home completely wrecked, and barely make enough to survive.\n\nBut I was obsessed with the internet. Every day after work, I’d teach myself to code. No courses, no bootcamp, just YouTube tutorials and reading other people’s code until things started making sense. Took me years. Oh yeah, in 2008, AI was only in movies, so code was made by real people 😅\n\nEventually I started making websites for local businesses. $100 here, $200 there, nothing crazy at all.\n\nBut here’s what pissed me off though: every time I took a new client, I had to learn a completely new WordPress theme. Different settings, different options, different everything. I remember spending an entire weekend just figuring out how to change a header color on some theme because the documentation was really bad.\n\nI thought: why isn’t there ONE theme that does everything?\n\nSo in 2016, I built it myself. Called it OceanWP.\n\nOther devs on forums told me to sell it for $59 like other premium themes. I released it for free on WordPress repository instead. People thought I was insane.\n\nThe first months, I started to believe that maybe they were right. A few hundred downloads, mass silence. I kept refreshing the stats page like an idiot thinking something was broken.\n\nBut then it started spreading through forum recommendations and blog reviews. People telling other people.\n\nBy year three, it was on 500,000+ websites. Still at 500K+ active installs today actually.\n\nThe model was simple: the free version was genuinely good. Not crippled, not annoying upsells everywhere. Just a solid theme. But if you wanted premium extensions like more templates, more features, priority support, you paid.\n\nBy year 2 I was making $15-20K/month. Just me, no team, no investors, no ads. Over 3 years the theme generated more than $1.5 million total.\n\nWhat made it work? I think it was just solving my own problem. Turns out thousands of other developers had the same frustration and I didn’t know it. The free model helped too. Free users became paying customers, and more importantly they told their friends. I also answered every single support ticket personally for the first 2 years. Probably wasn’t healthy but people noticed.\n\nI’ll share what went wrong in another post.\n\nSpoiler: I lost most of that money through stupid decisions. Turns out making money is very different from keeping it. Learned that the hard way, but that’s a story for another day.\n\nRight now I’m building an AI LinkedIn content tool. Same idea, solves a big problem for many people. We’ll see if it goes anywhere.\n\nAnyway, happy to answer questions about pricing strategy, the freemium model, whatever.\n\nCurious if anyone else stumbled into something similar, building a thing just because the existing options annoyed you.",

TWICE. Spoiler: not super dramatic.\n\n \n\nShort background. I’m 34 years old, male. Living a good life. I live in a townhouse in one of the nicest suburbs of a large city in a Scandinavian country. I have two healthy children. I work full-time as a property manager at a relatively large real estate company. I’ve been at the same company for ten years. I enjoy my job a lot since I’m good at it. I can work about 30 hours a week and handle the job without problems. I can come and go as I please. I pick up my kids from preschool at 16:00 two to three times a week. I’m social, have many friends. Two cars, huge mortgage, etc.\n\n \n\nThe problem may have been that things have become a bit too stable and therefore boring. My job doesn’t come with any bonuses, there are no unexpected joys in professional life. Sure, I sometimes make good deals that together have built a solid career. But there’s never any big unexpected boost and it no longer really contributes to self-realization.\n\n \n\nThat made me, about eight months ago, become obsessed with the idea of a side income. Preferably a passive one. Mostly to prove to myself that I can, but also to have that small extra income stream. I’m not a computer guy, but like everyone else I’ve used AI to clean up texts, structure things, and handle minor legal stuff at work. But in my new pursuit of income, I let my collaboration with CGPT go way too far, and it eventually led me to some incredibly depressing insights.\n\n \n\nThe first project came more from myself. The idea was to write digital guides in PDF format in the children and family segment. In the first and only product, I summarized different methods of sleep training for babies, compressed into a concrete, concise guide, and had a trained pediatrician validate the content and sign it as a quality guarantee. Not a bad idea, really. And during the project I learned how to start a company, build a simple Shopify site, the basics of Google Ads and Meta Ads, the basics of Canva, etc. Long story short: I burned too much money on ads before I was anywhere near breaking even. The insights afterward were reasonable and, in hindsight, likely, as I among other things completely underestimated the need for marketing and the work it entails. Passive income is not passive when you have to keep producing products and maintaining marketing. By the time I launched my little site, I had spent every evening for three months and had basically completely sidelined my regular job. I was almost burned out.\n\nIn short, I was naive enough to believe I would reach break-even with a product priced at $30 and then let it tick along and later calmly scale without further marketing work. The money ran out after 7 sales (satisfied customers), but I was far from break-even on ad costs. But as said, I learned a lot. Among other things, I realized that I have zero interest in building a brand, being visible, building awareness and community. I want to be completely anonymous. That makes it hard to market products, haha. Also incredibly naive to think that in my very limited free time I would learn what people spend their entire professional lives mastering.\n\n \n\nOne problem I discovered too late was that at some point along the way, I started trusting CGPT too much. From pure IT support it became more about discussing business plans and next reasonable step. I became increasingly frustrated because every time we simulated different efforts and scenarios, it turned out that everything was always more demanding, with more steps, and with worse outcomes. Example, CGPT suggests setting up a Meta campaign in a certain way, says it takes a maximum of 40 minutes and you’ll easily get 40 conversions. Result: irritation, two evenings of work, and zero outcome. Every new suggestion and simulation triggered me immensely and I put in more money and time than I should have in hopes of more sales. The result was that I became stressed, easily irritated, almost burned out.\n\n \n\nI paused the project. Felt much better for two months. Until two weeks ago when I fell back in again. A boring day at work and I started getting excited about the idea of finding passive income with a computer again. In short, I let CGPT run the whole thing from start to finish this time. Suddenly I was on completely unfamiliar ground (I know many of you here are incredibly skilled with digital products and social media—I am not). CGPT guided me to buy three Excel templates on Etsy with extended resale licenses, package them as a system— in my case about product pricing—and sell it on Gumroad as a system. I spent a week on this. Here too, CGPT’s projections were continuously lowered over time; time, cost, and difficulty for each step kept being pushed further ahead. The stress from burned money and workload came immediately this time. Difficulty eating and sleeping. Constantly working towards the launch, hoping that now I can launch, then I’ll let it rest for a while and let the revenue start coming in. In this project I had done zero research. I didn’t even know what Gumroad was. So when the launch was done and I began to realize that it requires extensive external traffic for anyone to even consider buying your product, the flop was a fact. Incredibly stupid in hindsight. But I think I believed it would sit on Gumroad, people would go there, search for my product, and it would sell now and then. But there it sits now. 0 views and 0 sales. $400 in total costs for Excel licenses…\n\nThe money was gone. The energy was gone. And I was so incredibly tired of walking around hoping for things and working in my free time only to be disappointed. I have been so incredibly distracted and not present during these periods.\n\nFor some reason I had never been in this forum before, and to comfort myself I went in and read yesterday. My feeling after reading 40+ posts was sadness and the feeling of being a total fucking idiot. Half of what is written here is exactly the same shit that CGPT suggested I should do as free marketing. I even went as far as to create a new Reddit account, copy-paste some fake helpful comments with the expectation that someone would ask follow-up questions and magically ask for my product. I’m really ashamed… But I did realize fairly quickly that it was idiotic.\n\n \n\nIt’s so incredibly depressing and brain-dead, and when you see the pattern of how many people fall into the same generic trap, you just get this dark and bleak feeling about the world.\n\n \n\nI fully understand that those of you who have followed the developments here more closely over the past few years probably think I’m completely lobotomized. And honestly: I’m not a stupid person and I have fairly good self-awareness. That’s why the realization of how I ended up in these failures came as an unpleasant surprise. In total, it amounts to $2,000, and now I’m going to try to forget all. The feeling of failure and loosing myself is way worse than the money. I’m not sure what I even want to get out of this post. I think I’m looking for some kind of closure and using this as therapy for myself. My hunt for a side income remains. There will be a small pause, though. The drive is there, but I need to find my way back to myself. And from now on, all ideas and plans will come from my own gut feeling or relationships in the real world. As a quiet protest, I didn’t even let CGPT translate this text, so you’ll have to make do with my middle-school English.\n\n \n\nIf you have any ideas that don’t consist of digital products or selling your soul online, I’m happy to listen!\n\n ",

I've used CGPT as a sounding board and as a tool to list out to-do items before an ideal launch date, and I can see how you can get stuck into a never-ending loop of more to-do's and more action items. As someone who struggles with avoidance and procrastination, it's a slippery slope for me to feel like \"just a few more steps\" before I'm really ready to launch. It feels like CGPT is a good resource to help with direction, but is a little bit backbone-less when it comes to the true pieces of launching a product and using ads effectively. I still think you could do it, and that I can do it, while keeping our souls in tact. &lt;3",

Honestly it is hard to get passive income as most of the time you have to set things up before and finding clients is difficult. I suggest you invest your money instead, I read that before investing it you should have at least 6 months of savings then when your money is safely in your savings bank account.\n\nThen with your monthly income you can invest it into ETF or S&amp;P 500 funds for example. Invest 100 or 200 monthly in an EFT over 5 years. These are short term investments that yield more money than traditional ones. Or you can invest over 15 years in those that are sort of retirement funds to find them they should be notified with the year of your retirement for example fidelity fund 2046 and here you save every month the same amount over the 15 years or more.\n\n\nAnd if you really want to make money you could sell old items, or cakes you make locally and add a few bucks in your pocket, there is even a guy who started making  income by renting his camping items to those who didn't want to buy some but it is still a bit of work.

      "selftext": "I hesitated to post this because I don’t want it to come across as a “look at me” thing. But when I was starting, I read a lot of posts like this quietly in the background, and they helped me stay sane. So here’s my experience.\n\nTwo years ago, I started an online service business from scratch. No audience, no personal brand, no capital, no insider connections. Just my laptop and phone. It’s a pretty unsexy business, mostly operational, mostly behind the scenes.\n\nIt’s an online, service-based business that helps small to medium companies solve operational capacity issues. We sit somewhere between staffing, operations, and process support. We are based in Australia.\n\n**Year 1: Reality check**\n\nThe first 3–4 months were nothing but rejection.\n\nNo clients and fuck all momentum. Just cold outreach every day and checking my inbox way too often. I seriously questioned whether I was just bad at this, or whether the idea itself was flawed.\n\nWhat made it harder was that from the outside, nothing was “wrong”. The offer made sense on paper. People understood it when I explained it. They just weren’t buying.\n\nEventually, one client came through. Then another. Then another. Growth was slow but real. I was primarily using cold outreach and typically landed 1–2 new clients per month.\n\nBy the end of year one, the business was doing roughly \\~$200k annualised revenue.\n\nSounds fine, but the reality was:\n\n* I was doing *everything* myself\n* I couldn’t switch off\n* Any problem in the business was my problem\n* Time off meant revenue anxiety\n\nMargins were decent, but I had essentially built a job that required constant attention.\n\nA typical day looked like:\n\n* Morning: outbound outreach and follow-ups\n* Midday: onboarding or solving client issues\n* Afternoon: fulfilment work\n* Evening: admin, invoicing, documentation, hiring\n\n**What didn’t work in year one**\n\n* I tried to “work harder” instead of working differently\n* I delayed hiring way too long because I wanted to save money\n* I over-customised for early clients instead of standardising\n* I said yes to the wrong clients out of fear\n\nA few things actively hurt progress:\n\n* Underpricing early to win deals\n* Letting one early client consume a disproportionate amount of attention\n* Avoiding hard conversations with poor-fit clients\n* Confusing activity with progress\n\nMost mistakes came from operating in survival mode.\n\n**Year 2: Thinking differently**\n\nYear two was when things actually changed, but not overnight.\n\nThe biggest shift was how I thought about the business. Instead of asking “how do I do this better?”, I started asking “how does this work *without* me?”\n\nI spent a lot of time studying operators who think in terms of:\n\n* Offers\n* Leverage\n* Throughput\n* Systems\n\nThen I applied those ideas to my own boring, service-based niche.\n\nPractical changes:\n\n* Opened multiple acquisition channels instead of relying on one\n* Hired people to fulfil delivery and admin\n* Documented processes I used to keep in my head\n* Focused heavily on retention and client lifetime value\n\nRevenue per client averages around $1.5k–$3k per month, so growth didn’t come from huge deals. It came from consistency, retention, and not breaking under load.\n\nBy the end of year two, the business is sitting around \\~$800k annualised revenue. The team is now 4 people, and for the first time, I’m not the bottleneck in every decision.\n\nBy year two, the daily routine changed significantly:\n\n* Morning: review key metrics, sales pipeline, delivery health\n* Midday: team check-ins and unblocking issues\n* Afternoon: system improvements or hiring\n* End of day: thinking time (offers, pricing, structure, constraints)\n\n**What surprised me most**\n\n* Boring businesses scale better than exciting ones\n* Consistency beats intensity every time\n* Most growth problems are actually people or systems problems\n* Confidence comes *after* evidence, not before\n* The business grows when you stop trying to control everything\n\n**If I were starting again**  \nA few things I’d do differently:\n\n* Hire earlier, even if it feels uncomfortable\n* Say no faster to bad-fit clients\n* Standardise before trying to optimise\n* Focus on one offer and one ICP for longer\n* Expect the first 6 months to feel pointless\n\n**Final thoughts**  \nI’m still quite far from where I want this business to be.\n\n$800k annualised doesn’t feel like an endpoint. If anything, it’s just the first stage where the business starts to feel structurally sound. There are still plenty of inefficiencies, things that rely too much on me, and areas that would break under real scale. I have much bigger plans for the next year, but I’m also very aware that growth doesn’t come in clean, predictable lines.\n\nIf there’s one thing this experience reinforced, it’s that progress is often a sludge. Long stretches where nothing exciting happens, where the work feels repetitive, where you question whether you’re actually moving forward at all. Most of the meaningful improvements happened quietly, without any sense of momentum at the time.\n\nLooking back, the biggest gains came from continuing to show up during the least rewarding phases. Not when things were exciting or validating, but when it felt boring, frustrating, or slightly pointless. That part doesn’t get talked about much, but it’s where most of the separation seems to happen.\n\nIf you’re early and it feels slow, unglamorous, or heavier than you expected, you're honestly probably on track lol",

It took a while for me to work out what my business was going to do but I think I've found my place in the market. I started the business working at the kitchen table, using my wife's laptop when she wasn't using it.\n\nIt's taken a lot of work for me, especially with a family with three kids and the arrival of number 4 art the beginning of last year. \n\nIn my first year, I worked myself into the ground. I worked day and night. I lost count on the number of all nighters and the lack of sleep was killing me, and having no money with a family to feed, so I just worked longer hours. I wasn't a nice person to be around.\n\nIn my second year, I cleaned up my sleep hygiene. I went to bed when I put my kids to sleep but I would wake up at 4 am to start work at my desk at home. I got some more wins on the board. \n\nNow entering my third year, I've told people that I  probably wouldn't start this business again. It's been too stressful and killing me. \n\nWhen starting a business, people don't realise how much work is involved and the risk you're taking. I knew I had an uphill battle to climb and I put every ounce of effort to make it work. I kept telling myself that 99% of people would have quit but the 1% of people who are successful keep pushing and working hard to win. They push themselves outside the comfort zone.\n\nI'm still solo and avoiding hiring people. This is by design. \n\nI hope this inspires other people who are looking at starting their own business or they are grinding away to one day be successful. \n\nRemember to work smart, have a clear picture of your goals and ask yourself if what you are working on right now is moving you closer to your goals!",

Etsy digital products work if you focus on one product type like planners, checklists, or templates and improve listings slowly each week. Affiliate marketing works if you pick one niche and keep posting consistently, otherwise you will see nothing for a long time. A faceless YouTube channel can work too, but it is not quick. There are many options, but consistency is the part most people fail at, so pick one lane, set a small weekly routine, and stick to it.",

Yet, the bigger the pain the bigger the payout. \n\n- Then check whether it’s a problem that many more ppl have.\n\n- design a SYSTEM to address that problem\n\n- test in a small scale\n\n- scale and maintain it\n\n- exit\n\nIn terms of skills, definitely learn anything you are interested in from business, finance, coding etc…but since it’ll take time and effort, make sure you like it!\n\nSorry, it’s not a solution that takes a week or a month to address, but that’s probably close to reality for what “passive income” really is.",

I was working full time and didn’t have a lot of spare hours either, so burnout was a real concern.\n\nWhat ended up working for me was getting into the financial services space by starting with an agency, rather than trying to invent something from scratch. It wasn’t passive at the beginning, but it was flexible. I could learn evenings/weekends, work with real people, and gradually build systems so the income became more predictable over time.\n\nWhat I liked about this path:\n\t•\tTime flexibility (you decide when you work)\n\t•\tSkills you learn are useful long-term (financial literacy, client conversations)\n\t•\tYou can start small and scale only if/when it makes sense for your family\n\t•\tOver time, parts of it become semi-passive through referrals and team growth\n\nIt’s definitely not for everyone, but for families with limited time who want something realistic and sustainable, it’s been a solid option for me.\n\nCurious to hear what others here have tried that balanced family life without burning out.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone thought i would do a little AMA. I’ve been making my living online for well over 25 years and just thought I’d give some time to answer any questions you have about the topics I’m familiar with. \n\nI have multiple passive online incomes from websites like travel blogs to social media sites, to AI Youtube channels. \n\nMy social media site basically runs on auto pilot there’s plenty of members who have been on the site long enough for me to give them privileges to ban people who try to abuse the site with spam or whatever. The site makes revenue off premium memberships. You can pay $10 a month to access more features. \n\nMy travel sites and other informational websites did take years to build but it pays off at the end, even small tourist towns travel guides sites get 50k-100k views a month and they tend to get high RPM around $6. But that’s only $300-$600 a month so you can’t live off just one site. I target what’s called “evergreen” content basically meaning content that’s always going to be useful. Unlike content that needs to be updated everyday. \n\nI have a software website that i developed automation software for repetitive tasks for an example scraping tools etc. The software is subscription based on average $10 a month to $99 a month. This is basically passive besides updating or improving the software from time to time. No advertising just ranking on google for keywords. \n\nI have a YouTube channel that I use AI to make videos, currently gets about 10 million views a week with 85k subscribers it’s not exactly passive income though because I believe soon as I stop posting the views will drop…. I literally make the videos while on the toilet most the time while most people scroll the videos on the toilet I’m making them so I’ll call that passive LOL. \n\nI have a 3D printing eBay business this is passive but you need a wife who ships the products but long as you have that, get a 3D scanner and a printer and start scanning everything we sell a lot of replacement parts for everything from your cars cup holder to your ovens knobs to toys. You also can make this completely passive with some print on demand sites I’ve heard but never tried. We don’t make enough profit off each sale so I don’t think a middle man service would work for us but it could for your products. \n\nBut anyways free to ask away and maybe I can answer some questions.

Free shipping as well.\n\nI just grabbed a mixed lot of keychains and compact wallets. Since they’re small, shipping is dirt cheap and easy to manage. All fits in a small shoe box. :) The best part is that they don't even sell on eBay or Mercari—they aren't even on Amazon. They seem to focus on big events and trade shows for wholesale instead.\n\nI just listed the stuff under their retail price and it moved fast. It feels like it’s still early days because nobody really knows about them yet.

I’ve been doing it for around 2 years now and so far it’s worked fine for me, but it’s not set-and-forget and definitely not for complete beginners. You need some real investing experience and basic crypto knowledge to even evaluate it properly.\n\nIn the end there’s no universal answer it depends on risk tolerance and how much effort you’re willing to put into understanding what you invest in.

          "body": "You’re already in a strong position for 23. With solid savings, HYSAs, and index investing, the biggest wins now come from staying consistent and growing income over time. Be cautious about adding complex or risky investments just to “do more.” Focus on maxing tax-advantaged accounts, keeping things simple, and only branching into things like real estate or side businesses if you have a real interest or edge.\n\nFor your HYSA, I’d advise keeping it focused on liquidity and stability, not squeezing every last basis point. The HYSA should act as a safe parking spot for emergency funds, short-term goals, and money waiting to be invested. I personally use a tool like Bank Truth to compare savings rates to make sure my emergency fund earns something while I invest. Make sure it’s FDIC-insured, easy to access, and has no fees. It’s okay if the rate moves over time. What matters is that the cash stays accessible, earns reasonable interest, and doesn’t tempt him to take on unnecessary risk.",

It's not huge but it's legit and you can do it whenever you have free time. The key is being selective about which surveys you take, some pay like $0.30 for 15 minutes which is garbage, but if you stick to the better paying ones it adds up.\n\nJust manage your expectations though, you're not gonna make thousands from your phone.

          "body": "YouTube has been pretty good for me, not entirely passive but between ad revenue and affiliate income I make around $1200 a month with about 50% of my views each month coming from my old video library. \n\nI’m not a huge fan of survey apps but do use 1Q, Google Rewards, and Meta Viewpoints. 1Q is usually only 1-5 questions and pays between $0.25-$1.50 per survey, the main reason I like it is every survey pays and it pays right away via PayPal (DM me if you want a referral link, referrals pay me $0.25 as well). Google rewards usually has surveys based on your search history and pays $0.15-$0.75 per short survey with a low threshold for payouts ($2.00). Finally Meta Viewpoints rarely has surveys but when they do, they are almost always $5-$10. They are all small but don’t have a bunch of qualifying surveys that don’t pay and have made a few hundred from them. \n\nAs far as true passive income, I try to put some of the money I earn from the other stuff into dividend stock portfolios that pay monthly (Mainly SCHD, JEPQ, DGRO, Main and O). I reinvest the dividends every month for now so I can continue to grow my dividend income in the future.\n\nI occasionally try out other side hustles but nothing super consistent.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been thinking a lot about how loosely the term passive income gets used here. Most things either take way more ongoing effort than advertised or they require constant attention to stay profitable. Lately I’ve been more interested in setups that are closer to low maintenance systems rather than fully hands off. For me, that’s meant focusing on structure and consistency over chasing new ideas. I’ve experimented with a few different platforms and approaches and some have worked better than others. One example has been using a sweepstakes style platform like Bracco as part of a rules based setup. It’s obviously not passive in the dividend sense but once the system is defined, it doesn’t require much day to day effort compared to other side income experiments I’ve tried.\n\n\n\nI want to know how people here define passive income in practice. Do you only count things that are completely hands off or do you include systems that need light maintenance once they’re dialed in?",

You should develop your own materials for sale and market them. Essentially, you'll need to build a business around yourself. Most people don't have the time and energy to do that, and will simply try their best using the platforms available. But as of right now, it's no way to make a living.

      "selftext": "Started this affiliate site back in June, productivity software niche, mostly high-ticket SaaS stuff. Been about 7-8 months now.\n\nFirst few months sucked. Maybe 50 visitors a month, barely any sales. Was targeting comparison keywords like \"Tool A vs Tool B\" because I figured people searching that are closer to buying than people searching \"best productivity tools\" or whatever.\n\nAround September October things started picking up. Traffic went from nothing to like 1,500 then 2,200 then by December I was getting close to 3k visitors. Revenue hit around $4,800 in December which felt insane compared to where I started.\n\nNow it's just stuck. Been at roughly 2,700-2,900 visitors for the past two months. Some days it's 2,500, some days 3,000, but it's not actually growing. Revenue's around $4,200 now, dropped a bit because one of my affiliate programs cut their commission rates in December.\n\nI'm still publishing, got 47 posts up now, but new stuff isn't ranking like before. My best post makes close to $900 a month by itself, ranks number 2 for some high intent keyword. But I can't figure out how to replicate that. Other posts I write just sit on page 3 or 4 going nowhere.\n\nConversion rate's decent, around 4%. I see people here with way more traffic but converting at 1% so I guess that's something. Most of my sales come from the comparison posts where I actually use both tools and show screenshots and stuff. Takes longer to write but people can tell when you've actually used something.\n\nStarted doing screen recordings in my posts too, just showing how the software works. Time on page went way up after that, from under a minute to like 3 minutes. Probably helped with rankings.\n\nGot an email list going, around 850 people now. Growing maybe 30-40 a week. When I send out new posts I get a spike in traffic and sales. Probably 20-25% of revenue comes from email but hard to track exactly.\n\nTried a bunch of stuff that didn't work. Did some guest posting, got a few backlinks, saw zero impact. Tried Pinterest for a month, total waste of time for my niche. Ran some Facebook ads and lost money, spent like $340 and made back maybe $190.\n\nI post on Reddit sometimes in relevant subs when I can actually help someone. That drives some traffic, maybe 150-200 a month, but you can't be promotional so it's slow.\n\nI'm using Ahrefs for keywords, costs $99/month which sucks. For images just whatever's fastest, usually Canva or APOB or Figma, doesn't really matter as long as it looks consistent.\n\nThe thing that's frustrating is I don't know what changed. Traffic was growing steadily, now it's not. I'm doing the same stuff. Writing similar posts, targeting similar keywords, same quality. But new posts aren't ranking.\n\nAlso seeing bigger sites starting to target my keywords. They have way more domain authority so I'm probably screwed on those. Been trying to go deeper on topics or find angles they haven't covered but who knows.\n\nLike did Google change something in December? Or did I accidentally do something that tanked my site? No idea.\n\nThe posts that are already ranking are still doing fine. They're not growing but they're not dropping either. It's just new content isn't taking off.\n\nSpending maybe 15-20 hours a week on this. Feels like a lot for results that aren't moving.\n\nStarting to think either I'm missing something obvious or this is just what happens and you have to grind through it. Not sure if I should keep doing the same thing or completely change strategy.\n\nAnyone else stuck like this? Or am I just doing something obviously wrong that everyone else figured out?",

Since there’s no revenue on our end, I’m trying to figure out the most efficient way to keep the top of funnel heavy.\n\n​As it stands: \n\nWe have solid screening/selection resources, so I’m fine with high volume, lower quality apps. We can filter through the noise pretty easily.\n\n​We’ve got a big LinkedIn page (have gotten about one hundred apps in the first few weeks) and have done some organic Reddit posts (have gotten about 50 apps in the first few weeks), but it’s not scalable, or sustainable.\n\n​I have $500/day to spend on scaling applications, and some team members to help with organic.\n\n​The Question:\n\nIf you had $500/day to get as many founders as possible to apply for a development grant, where would you put it?\n\n​I’m debating between Meta (for raw volume) or LinkedIn ads (expensive but targeted). Also curious if anyone has actually seen Reddit Ads work for this kind of thing, or if it's a money pit. Also considering sponsored placement in Discord groups, sponsored posts on IG, etc.\n\nWe're also considering finding some folks interested in helping us out, for \\~$20 per application they can bring in, but also understand for most people that wouldn't be worth the effort required.\n\n​Open to any \"best bets\" or specific platforms I should be looking at. Thanks.",

          "body": "I’d start by treating this like B2B lead gen, not generic traffic: go where founders are already in “work mode” and thinking about funding. Core split: 60% LinkedIn, 20% Meta, 20% experiments.\n\nOn LinkedIn: run lead gen forms targeting job titles (founder, cofounder, CTO) + company size (1–10, 11–50) + interests around accelerators, YC, Techstars, AWS Activate, etc. Lead-gen forms usually get more volume than sending to a landing page, then you can nurture via email. Use a clear hook like “non-dilutive dev support” and show 2–3 concrete examples of funded builds.\n\nMeta: use broad interest buckets (startup, SaaS, Web3, indie hackers depending on your focus) with simple video or carousel that spells out eligibility and timeline.\n\nI’d also test niche channels: Indie Hackers classifieds, sponsor a couple of startup newsletters, Reddit via tools like Pulse plus things like Apollo/Clay to find founders already posting about funding and DM them with a short, specific pitch.\n\nCore point: prioritize channels where you can precisely target founders in “builder” mode, then use cheap experiments to find your best-quality traffic source.",

      "selftext": "Hey SEO pros,  \nI’m currently working as an SEO intern, and my manager gave me a task to conduct keyword research and competitive analysis for the topic “Healthcare AI”\n\nI’ve been studying a lot (YouTube, blogs, Semrush Academy, you name it), and after a week of trying my best, this is the report I produced.\n\nOf course, I've used a lot of GPT, Semrush, and manual research to produce this artifact...\n\nI’d really appreciate it if some of you could take a look and tell me -\n\n* **Does this look like the right approach?**\n* **Am I missing something obvious?**\n* **What would** ***you*** **add or change if this were your report?**\n\nI’m still learning and just want to make sure I’m thinking in the right direction before I present it to my manager.\n\n**Any honest feedback would mean a lot to me.**\n\nThanks a ton in advance 🙏\n\nI know you’re all super experienced, and I’d love to learn from your perspective.\n\nHere’s my full report:\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Healthcare AI - Comprehensive Keyword Research Report\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\"Healthcare AI\" is a highly competitive, moderately searched keyword with significant commercial intent.\n\nAccording to Semrush data, this keyword has 2,400 monthly searches(in US) and a Cost-Per-Click (CPC) of $5.41.\n\nHowever, it presents considerable ranking challenges with a Keyword Difficulty score of 80 and 1.24 billion indexed results, making organic ranking extremely competitive.\n\n# Keyword Metrics Analysis\n\n**Search Volume &amp; Demand**\n\n* Monthly Search Volume (Semrush): 2,400 searches\n* Total Indexed Results: 1,240,000,000 pages\n* Trend: Stable and growing, reflecting the expanding adoption of AI in healthcare\n\nThe 2,400 monthly searches indicate a moderately high-traffic opportunity. While not in the ultra-high-volume category (50,000+ searches), this keyword demonstrates consistent, targeted interest from professionals, researchers, and healthcare organizations actively seeking information about AI applications in medicine.\n\n**Commercial Value**\n\n* Cost-Per-Click (Semrush): $5.41\n* Competition Level (Semrush): 0.5 (Low competitive bidding)\n\nThe moderate CPC of $5.41 suggests reasonable advertising costs.\n\nThe low competition value of 0.5 indicates that advertisers are not bidding heavily on this keyword, offering potential opportunities for paid search campaigns at relatively affordable rates.\n\n**Keyword Difficulty**\n\n* Keyword Difficulty Score (Semrush): 80 (Very High)\n\nThis reflects the dominance of authoritative, well-established domains occupying top positions, making organic ranking extremely difficult without exceptional content authority, comprehensive topic coverage, and significant link equity.\n\n# SERP Analysis &amp; Competitor Landscape\n\n**Top-Ranking Results Overview**\n\nThe current Google Search Engine Results Page (SERP) is dominated by authority websites and major technology corporations, with the following ranking positions:\n\nPosition 1: Google AI Health\n\n* Authority: Google (maximum domain authority)\n* Content Focus: AI's transformative potential in personalized, accessible healthcare solutions\n* Snippet Insight: Positions AI as a life-saving tool for medicine and healthcare transformation\n\nPosition 2: NIH PubMed Central - Peer-Reviewed Research\n\n* Authority: National Institutes of Health (.gov domain)\n* Content Focus: Comprehensive analysis of AI as a disruptive force in medical practice\n* Snippet Insight: Academic, research-backed content establishing AI's fundamental transformation potential\n\nPosition 3: ForeSee Medical\n\n* Content Focus: Practical benefits including faster diagnosis, improved treatment, and data-driven decision-making\n* Snippet Insight: Results-oriented approach emphasizing tangible healthcare improvements\n\nPosition 4: Coursera - Educational Content\n\n* Content Focus: Specialization programs for learning AI healthcare applications\n* Snippet Insight: Educational pathway, indicating strong interest in skill development\n\nPosition 5: OpenAI for Healthcare\n\n* Authority: Major AI company (published January 8, 2026)\n* Content Focus: Secure AI products for healthcare organizations\n* Snippet Insight: Recent, authoritative information on practical healthcare AI implementations\n\n# Related Queries &amp; User Intent Analysis\n\n**Primary Search Intent Categories**\n\n1. Application-Focused Queries\n\n* \"How is AI being used in healthcare?\"\n* \"AI in healthcare examples\"\n* \"Healthcare AI tools\"\n\nUser Intent: Users seek concrete, practical examples of AI implementation in healthcare settings.\n\n2. Industry Leadership Queries\n\n* \"Who is leading AI in healthcare?\"\n* \"Healthcare AI companies\"\n\nUser Intent: Competitive intelligence and identification of industry leaders and innovators.\n\n3. Specific Tool/Solution Queries\n\n* \"Which AI tool is best for healthcare?\"\n* \"Healthcare AI chatbot\"\n* \"Healthcare AI app\"\n\nUser Intent: Evaluation and selection of specific AI solutions for healthcare use cases.\n\n4. Career &amp; Employment Queries\n\n* \"Healthcare AI jobs\"\n\nUser Intent: Career opportunity research in the AI healthcare sector.\n\n5. Product Verification Queries\n\n* \"Is there a health version of ChatGPT?\"\n\nUser Intent: Seeking information about consumer-facing AI health tools.\n\n# Content Type Distribution\n\nThe SERP displays a diverse content ecosystem:\n\n1. Authoritative Brand Resources: Google, Microsoft, Oracle, OpenAI official pages\n2. Academic &amp; Research: NIH PubMed Central, Harvard publications\n3. Educational Platforms: Coursera specializations\n4. Industry Analysis: McKinsey strategic insights\n5. Company-Specific Information: Individual AI company homepages\n6. News &amp; Editorial: Harvard Gazette recent coverage\n\n# Search Features &amp; Rich Results\n\n**Featured Snippets**\n\n* Definition-style snippet explaining Healthcare AI fundamentals\n* Comparison table of AI medical documentation tools (DeepScribe, Freed, Tali AI, Suki)\n* ChatGPT Health-specific feature information\n\n**AI Overview (Google AI)**\n\n* Functional description of Healthcare AI\n* Key application categories\n* Benefits summary\n* Real-world implementation examples\n\n**Related Questions**\n\n1. How is AI being used in healthcare?\n2. Who is leading AI in healthcare?\n3. Which AI tool is best for healthcare?\n4. Is there a health version of ChatGPT?\n\n# Search Behavior &amp; Trends\n\n**Recent Activity (January 2026)**\n\n* OpenAI announced Healthcare solutions (January 8, 2026)\n* Harvard Gazette published AI regulation discussion (January 12, 2026)\n* ChatGPT Health features announced (January 14, 2026)\n\nThis recent activity indicates the keyword remains dynamic with continuous innovation and news coverage.\n\n**Related Search Interests**\n\nThe keyword demonstrates strong association with:\n\n* Specific examples and case studies\n* Company and competitive information\n* Tool/solution evaluation\n* Job market opportunities\n* Educational content\n* PDF resources and comprehensive guides\n\n# Ranking Difficulty Factors\n\nThe keyword difficulty score of 80 is driven by:\n\n1. Authoritative Domain Monopoly: Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and NIH occupy top position.\n2. High Page Volume: 1.24 billion indexed results create extreme competition\n3. Broad Topic Coverage: Every SERP result covers healthcare AI comprehensively\n4. Recent Authority Content: Established sites continually update content\n5. Semantic Relevance: Multiple related keywords (applications, companies, tools) fragment search intent\n\n# Strategic Recommendations\n\n**For Content Creation**\n\n1. Niche Specialization: Focus on specific AI healthcare applications (e.g., \"AI in Radiology,\" \"AI in Drug Discovery\")\n2. Comparison Content: Create detailed comparisons of specific AI tools\n3. Case Study Development: Document real-world implementation examples\n4. Thought Leadership: Publish original research and unique insights\n5. Video Content: Develop visual explanations and demonstrations\n\n**For Keyword Targeting**\n\n1. Long-Tail Variations: Target specific applications and use cases\n2. Question-Based Keywords: Focus on \"How to,\" \"Why,\" and \"What\" questions\n3. Company-Specific Keywords: Target individual AI company names\n4. Technology Stack Keywords: Target specific AI technologies (LLMs, computer vision, etc.)\n5. Job/Career Keywords: Capitalize on employment-related searches\n\n**For Paid Search**\n\n1. Moderate CPC ($5.41) presents reasonable advertising opportunity\n2. Low competition bidding allows for cost-effective campaigns\n3. Target high-intent keywords (tools, companies, specific applications)\n4. Focus on healthcare industry professionals and researchers\n\n# Conclusion\n\n\"Healthcare AI\" represents a highly authoritative keyword with moderate search volume (2,400 monthly searches) and significant commercial value ($5.41 CPC). However, the keyword difficulty score of 80 reflects extreme ranking challenges dominated by technology giants and authoritative institutions. The SERP composition indicates that users seek comprehensive, authoritative information spanning applications, market leaders, specific tools, and career opportunities.  \nSuccess with this keyword requires either:\n\n1. exceptional authority and content comprehensiveness for organic ranking,\n2. niche specialization in specific subtopics, or\n3. strategic paid search investment at reasonable costs.\n\nThe keyword remains highly relevant and actively updated, making it a valuable long-term target within strategic healthcare AI marketing and content strategies.\n\n**Semrush Data Referenced:**\n\n* Search Volume: 2,400\n* CPC: $5.41\n* Keyword Difficulty: 80\n* Competition: 0.5\n* Results: 1,240,000,000",

I can imagine other customers passionate about the product and seeing a story like that may be motivated to speak up and help point in the right direction. Eventually you can have some of these customers at staff parties and hand them some fun awards and swag. There's so much you can do with this.

It was an \"acct review.\" email basically said \"someone disputed a charge, we need to chk if u're a criminal, talk to you in 2 biz days.\"\n\nMy subscription box does about $90k a month. For two days, my store was in \"maintenance mode.\" New customers? Gone. Existing subscribers trying to update their card? Error message. I couldn't even log in to see who was trying to pay me\n\nI spent $1,200 on ads that drove to a dead page. My \"backup plan\" was Authorize .net... which was useless because the entire shopify storefront was disabled. the platform wasn't my partner; it was my landlord who changed the locks becz a neighbor complained\n\n\"review\" ended. no apology. the chargeback? customer lost their card and reported it stolen. bank's auto-system filed disputes for every recent charge. I won the case with tracking. My \"penalty\" was $1,200 in burned ads, 72 lost signups, and the realization that my biz is built on a foundation that can be paused on a whim\n\nso, for the scaled businesses here: what's ur actual, no-bullshit plan for when ur platform decides u're a risk for a day? not theory. what's in place rn that would keep u taking money if ur storefront vanished tomorrow?",

The logic says I should use these tools to compete with the big companies. But every time I try to scale my outreach, I just feel like I am polluting. The thing is, if you send 1000 emails and get 0 replies, you are not doing sales. You are just annoying people.\n\nI decided to stop with the extreme automation. It feels stupid to do this manually in 2026, checking forums one by one, reading comments, trying to find that specific person that has a problem today. It's slow. It feels like swimming against the current when everyone else is on a motorboat.\n\nBut when I actually find friction and I talk to the person, they answer. They answer because they realize there is a human on the other side, not a script.\n\nMaybe the \"big fish\" can afford to burn their reputation with spam. But as a small builder, trust is the only currency I have. If I lose that, I have nothing.\n\nJust a thought for those who are struggling to get their first users.

Before the call I drop it LinkedIn profile, name, company and location and it looks for insightful publications, closed venture rounds, anchor clients, recent major corporate events, analyzes the projects where this person involved.

Depending on the technology type price changes drastically. Cloud tools cost way more, but often times you pay not for the safety, but for the fancy UI. (no offence if it’s a key feature for you)\n3. Limits, and the way the tool explains them. It’s like the main thing I pay attention to. Does it actually stop you from doing dumb stuff like 500 invites a day or just lets you set that and blames you when you get banned.

Biggest wins: code review assistance (catches things humans miss at 2am), documentation generation (nobody likes writing docs), and customer support automation for common issues. The real impact wasn't cost savings though - it was speed. Shipping features that used to take a week now takes 2-3 days because the boilerplate work is faster. The catch: prompt engineering is a skill. Our team spent weeks figuring out how to actually get useful output consistently. It's not plug-and-play like the marketing suggests. Still worth it, but required real investment to make work.",

We built a triage system that now handles about 60% of incoming volume autonomously. Our team went from drowning in repetitive questions to actually solving complex problems and building relationships with customers.\n\nOrder tracking automation saved our ops team around 5 hours every single day. Just eliminated all the manual status lookups and update requests. Sounds boring but the time savings compounded fast.\n\nLead generation might be the wildest ROI shift. We went from $200/month on traditional tools to like $10/month with AI workflows doing better work. The targeting got more precise because we could iterate and test way faster.\n\nThe bigger shift has been cultural though. Once people on the team see AI handle the grunt work well, they start spotting more opportunities themselves. That momentum is probably worth more than any single automation.\n\nWe've had plenty of things fail too. Not everything works. But the stuff that does work has become essential to how we operate now.

The only reason why you think they don't complain about those tools because you have never had a friend who is an accountant or lawyer. \n\nI have a friend who is an accountant. I once spent 3 hours at dinner listening to him giving me a line by line breakdown about how much he hated Quickbooks. \n\nThe reason why you hear about crypto, dropshipping, and AI so much online is because most people who think they're interested in making money, are looking for ways to make money without much work. Everything you listed is easy to create a course to sell to those dreamers. \n\nMeanwhile there are thousands of possible businesses. \n\nIf you are interested in a local service business - ask ChatGPT for a list of local professions. Then start Googling them. Pay attention to every business in every strip mall area you drive by. Look at every vehicle that has a business name on it. \n\nResearch \"boring businesses\" - this was the hip entrepreneur term for 2025. It means businesses like lawn care that can earn alot of money but doesn't get the press the way an AI startup will. \n\nAnother option -listen to My First Million episode 779 - about franchises. There's 4000 different franchise concepts available. Many are not restaurants. \n\nGreg Isenberg launched ideabrowser. Everyday they post a business idea. They're always unique but once you read them you think \"yeah, he's right.\" Example from last week - building a database of where people are buried. It's a real problem. Not sexy.

But you need to understand those other things.\nI love marketing/sales, would rather talk to customers and potentials rather than anything else. I don’t like accounting. So I hire a bookkeeper to do that and she loves it. But I have a pretty good understanding of the reports and know when someone is wrong.\n\n4.

Your product most likely will be similar to theirs. \nDon’t be an exact copy. Make your product a little different/better. Be willing to be able to explain what differentiates yours from theirs.

It’s a small group of very human skills that compound over time.\n\nFirst is **learning how to learn**. Markets change, ideas fail, and assumptions break. Entrepreneurs who survive are the ones who can admit “I was wrong,” learn fast, and adjust without ego.\n\nSecond is **basic financial sense**. You don’t need to be an accountant, but you must understand cash flow, margins, and how long your money will last. Most businesses don’t die because of bad ideas but because of cash quietly runs out.\n\nThird is **selling and listening**. Not pitching listening. Real entrepreneurs hear what customers actually say, not what they hope to hear, and then shape the business around that.\n\nFourth is **emotional control**. Some days feel like you’re winning the world, some days like you’ve ruined your life. Being able to stay steady, make decisions without panic, and keep going matters more than motivation.\n\nAnd finally, **patience**. Overnight success is usually ten years of boring work. If you’re okay with slow progress and small wins, you’re already ahead of most people.\n\nYou can learn tools anytime. These skills take time but they’re what really carry you through.",

Consumers are upset that AI content is being pushed on them... Where the \"magic\" of content is that it is created by humans for humans. AI detatches the human from the creativity of consumed media in any form.\n\nPersonally I go out of my way to avoid content that is generated by AI because it feels inauthentic. So do a lot of others, and it's not a great look when consumers actively go out of their way to consume your products.\n\nI expect AI to thrive in areas where complex static computing often fails. Recognition, manufacturing, decision making, and tooling. I expect AI to fail on anything media related. Unfortunately an absolute shitload of investment and usage is in media generation. It will collapse, and from the rubble will rise the actual consumer usecase... Just like the internet bubble.",

      "selftext": "saw a stat that ~23% of gen z regrets going to college, and ~58% are running side hustles just to stay afloat. feels less like “exploration” and more like survival. what’s interesting is that this discomfort is pushing people to look beyond the default 4-year route, everything from community college + work, to non-traditional programs like Tetr that optimise for speed, building, and outcomes instead of long timelines. not saying college is useless. just feels like the label “best path” is doing a lot of heavy lifting.\n\nat what point do we update the advice we give 18-year-olds?\n",

Now it’s expensive, slow, and doesn’t guarantee anything, so of course people feel regret. That doesn’t mean college is useless, it just means it’s situational. If you want a regulated profession or a credentialed career, it still makes sense. If you want speed, optionality, or to build something on your own, it’s often the wrong move.\n\nSide hustling being so common feels less like ambition and more like survival. Wages haven’t kept up, rent is insane, and people are forced to stack income just to breathe. That’s not some entrepreneurial awakening, it’s a response to pressure. The mistake is pretending everyone should pick one lane at 18 when most people don’t even know how money works yet.\n\nThe advice probably needs to change from do this one thing to design your own path. Learn a skill that compounds, keep your costs low, avoid locking yourself into massive debt early, and stay flexible. College can be part of that, but it shouldn’t be sold as a golden ticket anymore. It’s just one tool, not the plan.",

I’ve been doing it that way since I was 14.\n\nThe first thing anyone should do is sit down and write out all the skills they already have. Real skills. Things you know how to do that someone else would pay for. Most people underestimate this part.\n\nFor example, fixing computers. It sounds outdated, but even in 2026 it’s often cheaper to fix a slow computer or remove viruses than to buy a new one. People will gladly pay $100 to get their computer back running smoothly, and they’re happy when they get it back.\n\nI’ve seen the same thing with simple services. A friend of mine started a mobile oil change business using his mom’s van. He’d drop her off at work, post ads on Craigslist, and spend the day driving around changing oil. That was it. Four, five, sometimes six oil changes a day. It worked because people value convenience.\n\nThe point is, you don’t need capital to start. You use the skills you already have and the tools already around you. When I was 14, I used my parents’ lawnmower, walked door to door cutting grass, and reinvested until I had multiple mowers and help. Eventually, we had over 30 yards, and I sold the entire client list to a larger landscaping company for thousands of dollars.\n\nThere are opportunities everywhere. You just have to stop waiting for money, permission, or the “perfect idea,” and start being creative with what you already have.",

Not here is a day off, but take a long weekend on me, no Slack, no guilt. That one hit harder than cash.\n\nIf you want something tangible, give them choice plus context. For example, a meaningful budget with a note saying use this on something that makes your life easier outside work. Flights, gym membership, a course, childcare, whatever matters to them.\n\nThe common thread is this: make it personal and make it about trust, not productivity.

If your team is in person I can't recommend it enough, and if they're not then I would honestly arrange some sort of online scavenger hunt or trivia they can work together on. You can give them small, inexpensive prizes throughout and then like everyone else suggested a bonus at the end. \nThis does depend on your budget though. If you don't have the budget to give a decent chunk of change then give them a great experience to show you care.\n\n\nMy staff honestly works hard and despite how infuriating managing people can be, my income is because of them.\n\n\nHalloween this year I turned our business into a haunted house (I do this every year with a different theme/story). For our party I set up an elaborate scavenger hunt where a witch had put a curse on the business and they had to work together to find parts of an incantation they could use to summon the witch who cursed us and vanquish her. Lights out, only lit by electronic tea lights which they had to form into a circle and stand inside of to summon the witch once they found all the parts of the incantation. I had my dad and a friend dress up in some gnarly/hideous witch costumes and scare them. Used blue tooth speakers and some animatronics along the way. Last year it was my BIL hiding in the furnace room with a mask and a machete. Hearing them scream honestly just warms my heart every year. It's honestly so cathartic and they have SO much fun and talk about it with all of our clients and their friends and family.\n\n\nI skipped Christmas this year because everyone was sick but I was going to have a krampus come in and scare them. Saving it for next year.\n\n\nValentines is on the 7th and I'm doing a high tea for them, dress code is the fancier, the better. I've designed a giant galentine's (we're all women) board game for them which is actually coming along and will be so good! They work through toxic masculinity, toxic femininity, women's health and social issues (just board game spaces, not actually and I've kept it funny and unserious) and at the end of the game, the last square is \"Self Actualization\". To get there they have to roll dice, square off in trivia and activities like flip cup, summon each other for help with scavenger tasks where they can all work together to advance on the board.\n\n\nThe board game pieces are instax photos of them that will be taken when they arrive for the party. Small prizes like chocolates and lip gloss, hair clips etc...throughout the game and the winner gets a teddy bear, heart earings, and a tote bag. \n\n\nI share all this because I AM SO EXCITED for it but also because it will cost around $500 and be a great party. It's a team of 10 right now and a $50 cash bonus would really just be lame, so for them this is much more fun with the budget. It gets everyone talking about the business in a fun and positive way. People who don't work for me keep trying to get invites but we are excluuuusive!\n\nTeam does $40k - $50k monthly. If you're creative you can honestly still put something fun together on a scrappy budget. I'm all up in the dollar store for these things.\n\nEditing to add that I also had a fortune teller come in for the Halloween party and do tarot readings for them! Also doing mini photoshoots at the Galentine's party 🥳",

My main focus is renovating kitchens and bathrooms (doing it for more than 10 years). Have a small team that I've been working with since the very beginning (we were employed together and decided to leave together), and a few more teams that I hired relatively recently.\n\nAt first, attracting customers was not an issue - word of mouth and contacts from my previous job took care of that, but then we realized that we couldn't grow that way.  \nTo solve that we created a website and started social media accounts, but that didn't help much, so we resorted to the services of SEO and SMM specialists. There were some results, but nothing impressive. Something else caught our attention: many customers said they found us in AI search results when they asked for recommendations on who to contact for repairs in California (we are based here). We didn't understand what was going on, but then it dawned on us - some articles from our website were randomly appearing in neural network search results.\n\nHere's my question: how does AI visibility optimization work? Is it possible to influence it in any way? Is it ethical?\n\nAnd this brings up another topic: how much sense does it make to focus specifically on AI SEO optimization to increase LLM brand visibility, instead of classic SEO? Is classic SEO dead in 2026?\n\nIn general, I was very impressed by how many people say they found us in ChatGPT, and now I want to figure it out, but don't understand how it works or where to start.\n\nSorry if my post is too confusing. Thank you!",

          "body": "Short answer: no, but the industry has a lot of noise right now.\nAI visibility optimization isn’t going anywhere language models are fundamentally changing how people discover products and services. But there’s a ton of BS out there promising quick wins through tactics that’ll likely backfire as models get smarter at detecting manipulation.\n\nThere is overlap with SEO fundamentals including good consistent and relevant content across all your platforms. The main difference is AI models can conceptually understand what you actually offer in ways search engines couldn’t. They’re reading your content, understanding context, and making recommendations based on relevance not just keyword matching and backlinks.\n\nThat being said there are a few good tools and resources \n\nProfound: This is the most capable automated platform in terms of AI visibility + content creation but the most expensive \n\nWerkHaus.ai: Has free tools and resources so understand AI visibility and GEO they also offer consulting. Good starting point to learn the space.  \n\nSEMrush: This is the biggest especially in the Agency world they have been around almost 20 years. That being said AI visibility is a product they offer but not their main focus",

Well, let’s find out.\n\nI was their star designer, firefighter, and the lead guy on literally every design project, so a lot of their clients know me personally. My primary skill is logo design and brand identity. I have designed logos and branding for a lot of well known and renowned brands.\n\nI never took a day off. Instead of 9 to 5, I was available 24 hours. And yet, when I wanted to claim my paid leave, they said that I didn’t follow the protocol and didn’t inform them two weeks in advance. Well, my unborn baby didn’t follow the protocol either, and now that he is coming four weeks early, I needed the leave. That was three months ago.\n\nThey took it out of my paycheck. I quit and started on my own.\n\nHalf of his logo design clients followed me, and now he has gone nuts. He wants them back, like I borrowed them or something.\n\nWhat do I do? I did not ask, call, or text any of his clients to come to me. They found me and came on their own. Am I in trouble?",

Post on LinkedIn that you've started something new. Let clients make the first move.

At $X, I'd recommend we focus on \\[specific piece\\]. You'd get \\[outcome\\] without the \\[removed elements\\].

Lol\nThere is no negotiation! \n\nIt's like going to walmart. It's not a flea market or garage sale so if the item is $59, you pay $59 for it or you don't buy it. \n\nThis is what people will end up getting if they are the ones trying to be smart, funny, entitled etc about a discount BUT the ones who I feel are sincere and just really had no idea it was going to cost that much money I have no problem  working with and often I give quite a considerable discount just because the people did the opposite of brushing me the wrong way. \n\nPeople that brush me the wrong way will get no discount and I don't even want them for a customer so I will send them on their way as quickly as possible.",

They don't really want the product but rather htan say it they'll just make something up(i do it all the time)\n\n  \na lot of people hate conflict. We can sometimes 'exploit' that but I've learned the customers who aren't interested and just are making up excuses aren't the best clients to have long term\n\n  \nthat doesnt' mean we shouldn't try to salvage deals and sometimes it may be a budget issue but normally if someone is interested in the product/service but the price is too high, they'll try to negotiate or say...can you do any better with the price?\n\n  \nin sales some are better at manipulating someones emotions than others. I'm not even really criticizing that. They work to make someone feel guilt over not buying. Years ago my father went on a sales call with someone who actually took out their family picture and said something like, 'do you want my family to starve? I know the product we are selling will work for you so just sign here so I can buy groceries'. \n\n  \nMy father wasn't all that comfortable in that situation but the salesperson he was with was a top producer.\n\n  \nmy point is a lot depend on if they really are oncerned about price or if they are jsut trying to find a way to say no politely . \n\nI see this more when I'm trying to sell an existing client something new. I have a relationship with them and maybe I'm trying to get them to spend some money. They act interested(maybe because we have built a relatinship over the years) but they'll try to find an excuse on why they aren't able to buy without making it personal. I don't guilt them over it\n\n  \nand when it comes to new prospects, I can typically tell fairly quickly if their expectations are set properly. I don't really work off a script so much but do know what to say in certain situations to try to find a way to close the deal. Maybe I should apply more pressure at times but my experience has been that when I really try too hard to close a deal where the customer isn't sure, they tend to be the ones I might have the most trouble with because if they feel a little pressured to buy, they will be more eager to find problems",

I'm like shaking with anger because we have busted our ass and complied with every bit of feedback. Like if our communication history was shown in a court of public opinion i genuinely feel our team would obviously be sided with.

As (negative) example:  If you go to a restaurant and order a chicken sandwich w/o mayo, and they bring you a burger, then you complain and they quickly and nicely replace with a chicken sandwich with mayo, then you complain again and they quickly and nicely bring the correct order.  Restaurants initial perspective is they did supply what was requested in a responsive to feedback and professional manner....but the customer likely sees that situation as a failure (took too many tries to eventually fix).",

It might be worth reaching out one more time to the office manager, just to get some closure or feedback on what went wrong. Sometimes, clients don’t realize the impact of their decisions, and a conversation might provide you with insights for the future.\n\nAlso, consider diversifying your client base if you haven’t already. Relying heavily on one contract can be risky.

      "selftext": "I am just the salesperson. We recently signed the contract with a client to provide furniture worth $110,000, but they won't pay us a deposit without a banker's guarantee. My boss said it was ok, that we have done a banker's bone before. So, he agreed to the contract, but here's the thing, he has no idea what a banker's bond is. He just said yes without thinking it through to get the project. We don't qualify for banker's bond and therefore cannot get the deposit. I cannot get the money to buy the materials, and the client will not proceed without a banker's bond. I am really so lost and don't know what to do. I am stuck in limbo. Any advice is appreciated.",

Make sure to get credit references from them if you're giving them terms!\n\n\nI would say, if that they're that hesitant about just giving you guys money, maybe offer to send them your materials invoices and they can pay those directly, which would come out of the total cost of the contract. I've done that for some of my smaller vendors who have tight cash flow, it happens more often than you would think in manufacturing.\n\nBut mostly, at the end of the day, this is the owner's issue to solve, and if he fumbles the contract, it's onto the next sale, unfortunately.",

They want their financial institution to prove to your furniture company that they have enough funds in their account to cover the $110,000 to make this purchase. When the bill comes due in full, then the bank releases the money to your business. By not collecting a deposit, your boss has agreed to use company funds to pay for the furniture upfront, instead of using the customer's deposit. Does your boss not have enough capital to accomplish the purchase order?  That has nothing to do with securing the bond though, that should have been done with your customer's bank at the same time the contract was signed.

He emails me saying he wants a full refund because the wallet \"didn't meet his expectations.\" I ask what's wrong with it. Is the stitching coming undone? Leather cracking? Hardware failing? Nope. He says he just \"realized it's not really his style anymore\" and thinks he should get his money back.\n\nI politely explained that my return policy is 30 days and that doesn't cover changing your mind half a year later after using the product daily. The wallet isn't defective. He just doesn't want it anymore.\n\nHis response? \"I'll be leaving a review reflecting my experience with your customer service.\"\n\nSo now I'm sitting here trying to decide what to do. Part of me wants to just refund him to avoid the bad review. I'm a small operation and every review matters. But the other part of me knows that if I cave to this, I'm basically telling him and anyone else that they can use my products for free as long as they threaten me at the end.\n\nMy policy is clearly stated on my website. The product isn't faulty. He used it for 6 months. But a 1 star review could genuinely hurt me.\n\nFor those who've dealt with this kind of thing - do you stand firm and eat the bad review, or do you just pay the extortion fee to make it go away?

          "body": "It's this throwaway generation's mentality.  Some learned that scamming is cool because they saw it on tick tock. I fought my first disgressors tooth and nail. Then I realize it's just not worth it to interact with the lowest of society.\n\nI'll give you an example. I had a bunch of items in a basket which are priced by grade and weight. Someone came up with a sticker from another item and claimed it was from their item. I know my products and told her there's no way that sticker was correct. She insisted up and down that I was wrong going on and on and on. Saying she would never cheat etc etc. She really ran me around and had me questioning things. \n\nI gave it to her for the sticker price knowing I was getting taken , and when she left I watched the video and saw her remove the sticker from one item and put it on to her item secretively. I was so freakng furious that she put me through all that and then lying to my face and using every skill that I've developed over years against me. \n\n15 minutes later I saw her walking across the street with her man and a 6-year-old son. They both had a sort of urban pride , he looked tough and had tattoos \netc. I walked over and waited to intercept. As they approached I held my phone out to her and said \"excuse me is this you changing my price tags?\"  She responded very authoritatively \"We're NOT doing this right now.\"  The gaul on this one.  \n\nSo I gave it to her. Called her a liar and a thief and shouted to the crowd on the sidewalk as much, pointing to her.  It became a big scene with her man defending her and me telling him his woman is a lying thief.  There was a lot of shouting and they never admitted to anything.\n\nI returned to my store glad that I called them out, but more frustrated than ever that they flat out denied everything. 5 minutes later she comes in saying she wants to return it. She apparently realizes that there may be legal consequences and wants to get out of the transaction now. I told her it's stolen merchandise I don't want it. She ended up leaving it outside my store just to get out of the situation.  I didn't touch it because I legit didn't want to have anything to do with it at that point. I don't want to sell something that has that energy on it when someone is trying to buy something nice and new. The item she finagled me on was a $30 large  handcrafted heart made of gemstone and people often ask questions about where it's from, etc etc..\n\nAfter I settled down I thought about how ultimately draining and pointless the interaction was. Yes it's good for people to be called out, but at the same time it's not worth it to get involved with people and their sh!tty lives.\n\nI can usually get people to admit the truth and enjoy exposing the lies, however after sitting I realized many cultures have a thing about losing face in public and will never admit to anything as a rule.  So when you're interacting with another culture you may be crossing lines for them that are more severe then their original action. I enjoy the justice of confrontation and tactfully push what I think I can, stopping just short of their fuse in a violent response. I'm never looking to get physical with people.\n\nSo this is perhaps a long winded way of saying do what works best for you. I think in your case if you have one or two customers a year like that it may be worth it to work with them to avoid issues. However I would make it clear in no uncertain terms to shame them in the process and say \"look what you're doing is completely unreasonable and wrong frankly, but I just don't want to deal with you right now\", \n\nI serve tens of thousands of customers every year. I've had the most idiotic confused people leave terrible reviews after being total rejects you wouldn't believe it. The unfortunate truth is that every single time, these people turn it around on you. They project their bad behavior on you like a scheming 12-year-old. As preposterous as that sounds, that's what happens every time. And then of course you also have to protect yourself against them having a social media following who may dox you or barrage your page with negative reviews. Sucks but that's the world we live in.\n\nI would take your ego out of it and do what is the best for your business.",

Tried to close deals over text. Then gradually went cold when someone wanted a call. I was literally letting go of opportunities.\n\nI was distracting myself with 1% improvements while avoiding what was probably a 400% business growth at that point.\n\n\nI didn’t magically fix it, but this is how I deal with it now:\n\n1. I only work with big high-ticket clients, so the earnings per talking ratio would be optimal.\n\n2. Brought on a sales rep.\n\n3. Reduced impostor syndrome by becoming more of an expert. So that people can’t corner me by asking something I don’t know.\n\n\nHope this helps a fellow introvert out there :)\n",

Right now it's just me and I'm doing okay, but I feel like I could be doing more to expand.\n\nAlso, on days when things are slow or I have downtime, I'm looking for ways to make some extra money on the side. I've heard people mention different side hustles and I'm open to pretty much anything that doesn't require a huge time commitment.\n\nAny tips on either front? How do you guys find new clients for service based businesses? And what do you do when you've got a few free hours here and there to make some extra cash?\n\nAppreciate any advice!",

For where I live, this is very good money.\n\nThe issue is I’m fully booked. Every new opportunity feels like:\n\n* take it and burn out\n* or say no and feel stuck\n\nThat’s what **pushed** **me** **to** **think** **about** **starting a company** and scaling beyond myself, mostly because I’m worried there’s nothing beyond my personal brand and trading time for money.\n\nBut the more I look at the numbers, the less it makes sense.\n\nA realistic service company in my space probably runs on 20–30% margins. To make the same \\~120k/year I make now as a freelancer, the company would need to do something like 400k–500k in revenue. And that’s **just** **to** ***match*** my income, **not even exceed it**, and obviously I wouldn’t just take all of that out personally. All with way more stress, risk, and management.\n\nAlso:\n\n* My clients hire *me*, not a team\n* I’d still be the bottleneck for sales and quality\n* Selling random products doesn’t feel like a real long term asset or exit\n\n**So now I’m torn:**\n\n1. Double down on freelancing + personal brand\n2. Keep freelancing stable and slowly try to build a company or asset on the side\n\nThe math makes scaling feel kinda crazy, but the idea of having nothing beyond freelancing long term also worries me.\n\nCurious how others have thought about this or what they’d do.",

You're not crazy for seeing the trap.\n\nFew thoughts from someone who's wrestled with this:\n\n**Option 3: Productized services.** Instead of hiring people to do \"whatever clients need,\" you standardize one specific deliverable with a fixed scope and price. Easier to train people, easier to maintain quality, easier to say no to scope creep. Not as sexy as building a product, but way faster to validate.\n\n**The personal brand path is underrated.** If clients hire *you* specifically, that's actually an asset - but only if you capture the upside. Raise rates aggressively. Be pickier about clients. You don't need volume if you're premium.\n\n**The \"asset on the side\" approach works, but it's a 3-5 year game.** Building something while freelancing full-time is brutal. Most people I know who did it successfully either reduced freelancing hours (and income) to make room, or burned out trying to do both at 100%.\n\nHonestly? If I were making 8-14k/month solo with 100% margins, I'd raise rates before I hired anyone. The clients who complain probably aren't your best ones anyway.",

But the real work isn’t hiring — it’s trying (and failing a few times) to turn *your* standards and client care into something other people can repeat.\n\nIf you care more about lifestyle, teams can be a net negative. In that case I’ve seen people do better by getting pickier, raising rates, and sticking to the same type of client/problem instead of “growing” just because they feel they should.\n\nI don’t think one path is smarter than the other.

What if one of your relatives needs you to be there if they get sick or injured? Imagine, god forbid, you get cancer and have extremely expensive medical bills and are unable to work for 6 months. What would you do? \n\nYou might have savings but ideally you want your business to be able to keep making money even if you need to take some time off. If you are doing everything yourself, then any event like this can destroy you financially. No matter how much you save, not having any income for months due to personal reasons is a real possibility that has caused many businesses to close before. None of those people planned on having crazy, life-altering events either but it happens. It can be hard to get that sales and operational rhythm back if you lose it. \n\nI would start small. You care hire an English-speaking admin online for pretty cheap. Shit, I have a part time admin in person in the US and it’s pretty cheap (35k annually) but has been a game changer. I can take on significantly more work now. Make SOPs, eventually hire someone in an operational role, and make sure that their work is up to your quality standards. If not, update your SOPs until a fucking gorilla could do it. You might think you are talented and unique, and maybe you are, but there are other talented and unique people out there too. Take your time and find good people who seem trustworthy. Do your due diligence, call their references, and ask for a portfolio of work. Every year there are thousands of talented, hungry young people graduating from universities looking for a position like that. Don’t be afraid to fire quick. Bad employees usually start to show their ass after just a few weeks, and I’ve found that no amount of coaching can make someone have drive or ambition.\n\n\nHow to grow really depends on your industry but look at what your competitors are doing and try to emulate that. No need to repeat mistakes they have already made. As many others have said, raising your rates is probably also a good idea.",

This instantly drives your scarcity and perceived value up - additionally you can take forward orders as well to guarantee future work (makes it easier to hire team and plan workload). If the waitlist fills up, raise your rates immediately.\n\n1. Work out which of your existing clients you have the most impact for, that you love working with, and can afford pay you quickly.\n\n2. Take that list and  find commonalities in what you deliver for these clients. Dig deeper into the key *outcomes* you create for them and the problems you solve or help them avoid.\n2a. Look for commonalities in praise and thanks you receive from these clients as well (\"no one we've ever used before did this for us\" or \"no one ever did it that way before\")\n\n3. Quantify it - Work out what each of those outcomes are worth (ballpark is fine) and what the opportunity cost is of not fixing the problems you solve (eg bad website left unaddressed might have 25% lower conversion rate than industry standard)\n\n4. Create an outcome focused offer (tangible so you can point to an end result or recognisable interal state change) with the defined outputs the dream clients you identified in step 1 want\n\n5. Map all the steps, outputs and services you provide to create these outcomes (rough is fine) and then eliminate all unnecessary ones. There will be things you do and over deliver on that you care about which clients probably don't care about much (or as much). Especially look for timely extras that create diminishing returns on time invested.\n\n6. Cease all advertising for other services, particularly if they're hourly priced. You can do them, but don't advertise them. \n\n7. Focus on promoting these outcomes focused packaged offers, price them as value based and use language to sell the state change and outcomes instead of the inclusions. Don't itemise hours taken in the offer. Focus on value your work creates.\n\n8. Create case studies etc using the client comments from step 2a. And frame them as \"and that's why we do it this way\"\n\n9. See if you can sell the offer that excites you the most, if it works, do that on repeat and now you have a value based business and you're no longer priced as a commodity.\n9a. Repeat with each package if you've got multiple services\n\n10. Decide if you want to get more clients or just work with better ones. Decide if you want to hire a team.\n10a. Increase rates regularly if your wait-list keeps growing.\n\n11. If you chose to hire a team, you've got the processes built out and it's much easier to handover - you've also moved closer to a turnkey business which is sellable\n\nHope that helps :D",

We are good and knowledgeable at what we do. I believe we are around 1 of 6 shops in our State that can offer the level of expertise and service that we do. \n\nWe did a repair back around Thanksgiving. Normally, the customer picks up their own items. However, this customer lives around 30 minutes away and is in her 70's so we offered to deliver it free of charge as we had another stop in that direction. Normally a house call to her area is $175.\n\nShe has contacted us twice to come back out to her home. We went both times free of charge and both times found nothing wrong. She was not taking care of the item in the proper manner and we advised her of that. We did not charge her for the stops, again we tried to toggle them on existing stops in that  area.\n\nToday she calls and is irate. She is screaming how she paid $450 and the item was not functioning correctly and she was insulted we suggested she was not fully understanding how to take care of it. She additionally started the conversation with \"don't make me take you to small claims court.\" I point out that she has a year warranty and that we generally never go to the customer's home, we did so prior to be helpful...no one is refusing to honor her warranty or assist. I advised that customers generally bring their item back to the shop if they are having issues and we can re-test, re-examine. She carried on she was not driving 30 minutes to the shop and I explained we have customers driving 3 hours to bring things to us. \n\nThis went on for a good 5 or more minutes of her making insults (ie, \"other shops could do a better job\" or \"you people don't know what you are doing\") before I simply said we are done for today, the options are to bring it to the shop or wait until we are in your area which may be a week or two. I advised her threatening, talking aggressively, or making insults is not going to engage us or encourage us to respond or help any faster. As we went to hang up I heard her say \"you bitch.\" \n\nI immediately called her back and informed her that I heard her comment. I told her she was no longer welcome to call our business. I told her I was not going to put up with her hostile and now verbally abusive behavior over something so trivial. I suggested she find another shop to help her (BTW, there is not one for at least 90 minutes). \n\nHave you had similar encounters and how did you handle them? \n\nAny thoughts on how the warranty is handled if you are no longer willing to see the customer due to their behavior?\n\nAs a small business, my other partner said \"great, now we just have to wait for the negative review.\" But my position is, why do we as a small business have to tolerate piss poor behavior from customers, why is it wrong to put your foot down and say \"no more, we are done\".....",

In most of those situations I refund them their money, it’s not worth the headache. Yeah I lose revenue, but the I look at it as paying for better mental health. I also blacklist them on our appointment scheduler so they can’t bring in any other instruments In the future. One of the other things I do is make sure every customer gets a follow up email encouraging them to leave a Google review. This has resulted in hundreds of 5-star reviews for us. The few bad reviews I’ve gotten I respond to directly, and put in a dispute with Google. Between the huge amount of 5-star reviews and a thorough reply to a bad review Google will usually pull the negative review down.

But there's high demand for what I do, so basically I have as much work as I want and more than I can realistically take on in short order. \n\nBut no matter how clear that is and should be, some people are very very adamant about being priority A and setting their own policies rather than following mine. \n\nIn this case, around this time last year I dealt with a person much like yours.  I have a housecall charge and the rest is paid when I return to complete the work. This customer demanded he pay me in full to the point where he refused to even give me his card until I agreed to.  \n\nSo against my better judgement, that's exactly what I did.  I went to schedule his next visit and he told me \"no hurry\" and that it would be okay if it was later on.  And the day that I wanted to come by had inclemate weather, so I wasn't able to come. \n\nHe called twice the next day - a Sunday, which is a day where I'm closed - and then again Monday morning to yell at me.  He made a big point of how he'd already paid me and how I wasn't calling him back, so I must be cheating him. \n\nI called him back, noted the weather, his own statements and business hours and he calmed down.  I noted that I'd contact him back with some scheduling options as quickly as I could. \n\nAnd I did. But he did not respond. So I did not schedule him and focused on the customers who... called me back and stuff. \n\nThen he came back around, yelling at me for \"forgetting about him\" and pointing out again how he'd already paid me.  I noted that he was unresponsive to my messages about scheduling and he blew that off, stating I could come \"at any time I was free\"\n\nI noted how I'm never \"free\" and my policy is to set a hard schedule. So we did.  But then a winter storm came that day, too, so I had to cancel it.  He said he understood.  I offered him more scheduling slots and he wanted to know why I didn't just come on by.  I had to re-iterate myself. \n\nThis went on for a few weeks. I'd call.  No answer.  I'd offer him scheduled time slots via voicemail and text that would go unanswered. Then he'd suddenly call one day to yell at me for not coming.  After all, he'd already paid me. I then tried to force a slot on him and he said it was no good, then ignored more attempts and so on. \n\nThen came the big cuss storm day.  I reiterated everything HE said and did and didn't do and offered him a refund. He refused it, saying he wanted the work done because there's nobody else out here who can do it.  So I call him back, offer time slots via voicemail and again, no response. \n\nThen comes another morning. This time, 16 voicemails at 6am calling me MFer and all that stuff.  So I drafted a kind response to send via text stating that I'd tried all of these things... documenting all the times I tried... all his refusals to follow policy... and added that his reactions no longer allow me to feel safe in his home and therefore, I'm refunding his money and blocking him.\n\nThat way, I had everything documented if he ever went BBB or legal or whatever.  Nothing ever came of it, though. \n\nDo NOT ever let yourself feel bad for putting your foot down.  Drawing a line.

So good that in 2025 I decided to start my own company and sell servers (always loved hardware) to other businesses that need them for their operations. And it worked out great, given the crazy shortage of capacity amid the growth of the LLM sector.   \n  \nBUT these taxes in Europe are *killing* me. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to start working for nothing just because I have to strictly follow corporate tax compliance, because I'm a decent person and I don't like prisons, haha. \n\nHeard that VAT can be partially refunded or not paid at all, and even looked for some local sales tax advisory services (I'm in Turkey), but so far it all looks too complicated and hopeless. I'm not even thinking about VAT exemption - it's too cool to be true. But hope dies last, so I want to ask you - has anyone dealt with this crap?   \n  \nAll this time, I've been sending servers all over Europe to minimize ping for my clients, and my wallet can no longer withstand these taxes.   \n  \nWould be VERY grateful for your help.",

I was fed up and I jumped at the first sign of “I don’t have to work here anymore.” Had to rely on the business profit to survive, so couldn’t take risks and grow. Had to work in the business too much. Learned a lot. \n\nSecond business - kept the 9-5 for 1.5 years. I wanted to quit it again 1 month in but I held on and it changed everything. Allowed me to hire people and pay a good wage, so they could grow the business instead of me. I lived off &amp; invested my 9-5 income into the business. Allowed me to take risks and experiment more freely.\n\nI don’t regret quitting early the first time, because the pressure of not having a back up plan pushed me to succeed &amp; sacrifice. Which taught me A LOT about myself and business. Which helped A LOT the second go round. No wrong answer but I can confidently say my second business is going MUCH better than the first.",

I put about $250,000 into the site to improve it.\n\nThis site was the first car wash in my city maybe 35 years ago, since then this site has failed 3-4 times that I know of. When I bought it, this wash was 1 of 3 and now I'm 1 of 9 with the 6 new washes being huge private equity run large brands with hundreds of locations.  Probably $5-8million dollar beautiful locations\n\nThe site never profited. At best it broke even. Now with all the new competition I'm losing about $7700 a month.\n\nPart of me is reluctant to close it down because I still have this hope that it could be successful to some degree.\n\nOther side of me is I'm tired of dealing with employees, customer issues, legal, and accounting work., Always the possibility of liability from a customer or even an employee.   I'm also at a point in my life where I'm able to retire.  My possibilities are 1. Attempt to sell the wash as a complete car wash 2. Sell off the assets and sell building.  3.  Lease the vacant building in land.\n\nAbout $100,000 of the equipment I could use at another location. I was considering listing the complete wash for 750,000 and see where it goes. After that I would probably lease just the building and land for maybe 3000 a month.\n\n  \nThank you for any time and advice you can share",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nI'm in the early stages of launching a small product-based side hustle mostly simple, everyday home goods and accessories that people actually use, think kitchen organizers, travel gadgets, that kind of thing. After researching suppliers, it quickly became obvious that China is where almost all of this stuff gets made affordably. But as a complete beginner with no prior import experience, I'm trying to avoid the classic pitfalls of sketchy suppliers, poor quality, massive shipping delays, unexpected tariffs, or getting stuck with unusable inventory.\n\n\nI've spent the last few weeks poking around the main platforms. Alibaba is the go-to for most people I see online, but it feels overwhelming with all the trading companies mixed in with factories. 1688 (through agents) seems cheaper for direct-from-manufacturer but has a language barrier. Global Sources looks more premium/B2B-focused. I also came across Made-in-China, which appears geared toward verified factories with detailed supplier profiles and some emphasis on quality checks—though I know sites can hype themselves up.\n\n\nI'm not married to any one platform; I just want to do this right the first time and not waste money on bad orders. Fellow small business owners who've successfully imported from China:\n\nWhat platforms or sites have actually worked best for you in practice (pros, cons, or why you switched)?\nHave you had good/bad experiences with Made-in-China.com specifically, or is it similar to the others?\nWhat are your biggest red flags when evaluating suppliers (e.g., fake reviews, MOQ issues, communication)?\nPractical tips for newbies: Do you always order samples first? Use sourcing agents? Preferred payment methods (PayPal vs. bank transfer vs. Trade Assurance)? How are you handling current tariffs/customs without getting hit too hard?\nAny must-do steps or resources (books, YouTube channels, forums) that helped you get started without major headaches?\n\nReally value any firsthand stories what went wrong, what you'd do differently, or what surprised you positively. Thanks so much in advance for sharing your wisdom, it's helping a ton as I figure this out!",
