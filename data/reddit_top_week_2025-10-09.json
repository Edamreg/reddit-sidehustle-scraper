      "selftext": "Use your every unfair advantage in life to get ahead\n\nMost people waste years waiting for a “level playing field.” But here’s the truth: the playing field will never be level. Everyone has unfair advantages—connections, skills, personality traits, timing, geography, family, even struggles that shaped resilience.\n\nThe ones who win are not the ones who play “fair,” but the ones who double down on their edges.\n\nIf you have charisma → leverage it to build a network faster.\n\nIf you grew up broke → leverage your survival mindset, you already know how to stretch resources.\n\nIf you’re in tech → leverage your ability to automate, build, and scale faster than 90% of the world.\n\nIf you’re in a city with opportunity → leverage proximity, go to every meetup, knock on doors others can’t reach.\n\nIf you know how to write/speak well → leverage content, make your words work 24/7 online.\n\n\nStop waiting for permission, stop wishing you had what others have. Take inventory of YOUR unfair edges and lean on them shamelessly. Let’s say, start a business with platform like Sitefy and gpt. That’s how people actually pull ahead.\n\nQuestion: What’s an unfair advantage YOU have that you’re underutilizing right now?",

They send you push notifications as soon as things are listed so that you are the first one to be able to message and go get a really good deal if something is listed way below what it’s worth.\n\nIt’s something that you can do during your week “off”, but also something that you can do in the morning/evenings before and after work.  I’ve seen people in this sub that have commutes that are two hours long set up the app to look for things along their path to and from work and then they just set up pick ups/drop offs along their commute and they make a couple hundred extra bucks every week pretty much just doing the same thing they’re already doing.\n\nThat’s how most of these big guys are flipping cars, couches, phones, and other types of stuff. They aren’t paying the normal prices that you see, they’re paying way less and they’re doing that by being the first one to go get these deals from these people that underprice them either because they don’t know the value, or don’t care about the value and just want it gone. \n\nMy advice would be just find something that you know a lot about, use the app to look for you, and just pick up the best deals and make sure that you’re the first message. Pretty easy to make a couple hundred extra bucks a week.",

I usually grind the task while on the bus, before sleep. Got 10-15usd per day. Enough for quick meal.\n\nIf you’d like to use my Referral Code for AttaPoll, my code is “QJZJU” and we’ll both get 50c when you sign up!",

There are people around here that make things with 3d printers, photographers,  Dj's, pooper scoopers, etc. Start by telling friends and family, then advertise if you want to grow it into your primary source of income.\n\nI kinda wish I would have thought of the pooper scooper idea instead of cutting grass when I started because there's hardly any overhead, and the guys doing it around here are making a crapload of money. (Bad pun intended.)\n\nI would highly recommend doing something that doesn't require much overhead to do. Lawn care as a side gig was just my light duty personal truck, a push mower, weedeater, and blower. Lawn care as a company became  multiple trucks, trailers, zero turns, commercial equipment, dump trailers, etc. \n\nThat stuff coupled with maintenance, registrations, insurance, fuel, etc. gets pretty expensive and has added to my debt. It is good debt, but it still bugs me. No overhead means profiting day one.\n\nYou can even share the experience with your son. Let him help you come up with ideas, and even steer the ship a little. It's a good way to bond and learn together. My kids help promote our business and even pull weeds for some extra spending money.\n\nDon't worry, you got this!!",

AI can tell the story if you must, but it cannot do the creative side! \n\nThe second skill is creating an ebook cover. You’ll need a simple Canva or Photoshop tutorial for that.\n\nThe third (it’s not marketing) is meta. You must know how to publish correctly. This is tags, keywords, the story description itself, etc. \n\nIf you can do all three, great, you have the potential of $1k/mo+ minimum if you give this hell. I see a lot of amateurs make a lot of money in here, but that’s not really what it’s about. That’s the 1% doing full time, etc.\n\nYou’d likely start and put in an average of an hour a day. That would come out to an ebook going live maybe 2-3x a week, even more once you have the system down. \n\nDouble down on wins, let the losses go and learn what does and does not sell. As you get better with the above skills, you’ll make more. And, sales from stories layer.\n\nWhen you stop publishing, maybe 20% sales will stay, passive, continuing to sell. I’m over a decade in now and haven’t published to my catalog yet this year. \n\nMy recommendation is to first learn, then second try. Do not try first. This is nsfw art and there are rules and regulations. There are no three strikes because if you mess up, you’re likely done with that platform.\n\nAnyways, if you’d like to know more, you’re welcome to check out my profile. I have a discord server with info and some tips, and a critique area for stories and cover art. You can also advertise your new stories to my core audience of smut buyers and readers.

Being in the biz so long and a web dev, I couldn’t help but fill in what I see wrong with the industry. It’s not a lot of money, but so far there’s a handful of authors making grocery money at least!\n\nRighto, it is now very late and I am to bed.

My paychecks now are usually $550-$650 every 2 weeks, but this will decrease immensely for those few months of being busy with school. \n\nWhat are some ways that I can make $200-$400 or more extra a month (Already do DoorDash, but even then I won’t have much time to do that next semester)?  \n\nEdit: I appreciate all replies , though I’d like to mention I prefer non-AI related ideas.

      "selftext": "LinkedIn Content Workflow Completed!\n\nToday was a massive milestone. After weeks of focused tinkering, I successfully launched my second major client-facing workflow from end-to-end in n8n: a complex, multi-step LinkedIn content generator.\n\nThis is the backbone of my initial offering. The flow starts with an input form (soon to be a schedule trigger) where I outline the client's weekly content goals. From there, the magic happens:\n\n1. LLM Generation: It produces the complete post copy: hook, body, CTA, and relevant hashtags.\n2. Visual Creation: It seamlessly calls an image generation API to create a polished, accompanying visual.\n\nThe part I’m most proud of—the step that makes it a true client product is the Human-in-the-Loop Approval.\n\nThe entire draft (text + image) is sent directly to the client's designated Slack channel for review. They simply hit 'Approve' or 'Deny.'\n\n* Deny: The workflow loops back, and a new version is immediately generated.\n* Approve: It automatically posts to their company's LinkedIn page.\n\nSeeing that final, approved post go live was a huge relief. Building a system with a solid client approval step feels like transitioning from a personal project to a viable product.\n\nThis milestone is perfectly timed, as I have a meeting with this client next week. We’ll be discussing how to expand beyond content and start automating more crucial business areas, like their sales and marketing processes. Getting this content workflow locked down gives me a huge confidence boost going into that discussion.\n\nThe Slack approval, while functional, feels a bit clunky. For those running similar client-facing automations, how have you streamlined or handled effective human-in-the-loop approvals? Any better integration ideas for speed and simplicity?",

I been posting my YouTube clips on my TikTok but it usually generates less than 1k views tbh. \n\nFrom the start, I was posting viral clips by one YouTuber and that’s how I got 50k views(anime stuff as well). \n\nCurrently the account is at the stalemate where I’m not gaining or losing followers but view count is a bit low. I was wondering what I should do with the account. I want to use it in a way that could benefit me because 50k followers is ALOT and I don’t want to let that opportunity go to waste. \n\nI been thinking about starting like a dropshipping store and converting that tiktok to a “store” where I can advertise the products I want to sell. Maybe even Digital products. Those are what I’m thinking of currently. \n\nIf you all have some advice or tips on what I should use the account for, please let me know(I am also monetized but I need 1 min per video). ",

I added meal tracking, a “stinkiest day” insight, and some affiliate links for gut health stuff just to see what would happen. Now there are over 1,600 farts logged from 60 countries… and today I made my first $1. It’s not much, but that was the goal. Just make one dollar from something I built.

However I am not naive to believe that every month will be like this. On average I do around $4k-$6k a month which for my lifestyle is still very good but last month I hit my first $10k month. For the last few months I keep beating my previous months numbers revenue wise so it just has me thinking about the future. \n\nWhat is one thing I should start doing to build up my wealth and make this money work for me? \n\nI do have $12,500 in stocks, like Tesla, Realty income, Google and more. But I know that I need to play it safer and also be more diversified. \n\nJust looking for different prospectives. I am seeing a financial advisor in a week, so I will get a better understanding of what I want to do but I will bring up some ideas that stand out to me on here. \n\n",

Everyone has unfair advantages—connections, skills, personality traits, timing, geography, family, even struggles that shaped resilience.\n\nThe ones who win are not the ones who play “fair,” but the ones who double down on their edges.\n\nIf you have charisma → leverage it to build a network faster.\n\nIf you grew up broke → leverage your survival mindset, you already know how to stretch resources.\n\nIf you’re in tech → leverage your ability to automate, build, and scale faster than 90% of the world.\n\nIf you’re in a city with opportunity → leverage proximity, go to every meetup, knock on doors others can’t reach.\n\nIf you know how to write/speak well → leverage content, make your words work 24/7 online.\n\n\nStop waiting for permission, stop wishing you had what others have. Take inventory of YOUR unfair edges and lean on them shamelessly and start [business](https://sitefy.co/websites-for-sale/). That’s how people actually pull ahead.\n\nQuestion: What’s an unfair advantage YOU have that you’re underutilizing right now?",

So I turned what I knew into a digital product. \n\nHere’s the exact process I used!! \n\n\t1.\tChose a topic I lived through. For me it was my infertility journey → I turned it into a guide/book. For you it might be budgeting, home hacks, recipes, plants, etc.\n\t2.\tMade it useful. I wrote out steps, added checklists, and made it practical (not just a story).\n\t3.\tCreated a simple PDF in Canva. Took me 3 days, no fancy design.\n\t4.\tUploaded it to Payhip. Free to start, handles payment + delivery.\n\t5.\tPromoted it with my story. I shared posts in communities where people were struggling with what I had already overcome. That’s how I got my first sales.\n\n💡 Key tip: don’t overcomplicate it. Start with ONE product that solves ONE problem.\n\nI do have a step-by-step playbook I put together (with resell rights + 10 done-for-you products) — if you’re curious, DM me!\n\nHappy to answer questions here though — what skill or experience would you turn into your first product?",

      "selftext": "Every post I see here lately is some dumb get rich quick scheme or AI tool scheme making fake products or “influencers” it’s just dumb and it contributes to internet rot this immoral and it’s slop. \n\nTo make passive income It’s not hard. Basically what I did is take a hobby I love (I made modifications to video games) and try to do it to the best of my ability. Try to be as professional as possible, push myself to learn and grow. That’s it. Push your hobbies into a professional sphere. That’s how to do it. \n\nAgain this was a hobby I did for fun but it started with making video game modifications. Personally I started make a small amount of passive income (300$ a month) via hosting the modifications on a site that generates ad revenu from adds in the sides bars of the site, then made an official company out if it down the line for myself (just me as owner operator and hobby in free time). Started occasionally hiring one time payment contractors to do tasks for me- built a catalog of successes partnered with a game company and started creating content for them which if used I make money off the sales my work is used in. This turned it into about 900$+ a month some months over 1000$ a month passive income. \n\nNow I’m slowing that down and decided to write a sci-fi book. It’s in total about 350 pages, will be part of a series and I’m working to make it as professional as possible with the goal to publish. Again this is a hobby. It’s for fun. But if I get it published my fun could net me well who knows anywhere from 2,000 or 5,000 to 15,000 off the bat plus any extra the book makes. I’ll assume lowest so let’s just say 2000 or something for a book that took me 9 months for fun in my free time. I learned how to write better, and I’m learning what publishing looks like and how to sell it to them. \n\nTo me that’s the legit way to make passive income. It takes more work. More time it’s not a get rich quick scheme it build skills and if you want to constantly push yourself in your hobbies and take it to a professional degree then it’ll happen. ",

      "selftext": "I’ve been deep in the AI Influencer space for a while now, building hyper-realistic digital personalities that grow on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, so I figured I’d share what it’s *actually* like.\n\nWhen I started, I thought it’d be easy: generate a few images, post them with trendy captions, and watch it blow up. Reality check, it’s not that simple. The first versions looked uncanny, the captions were too generic and ChatGPT written, and engagement was dead. It took months of experimenting with tone, personality, and storytelling to make the AI feel “human” enough to connect.\n\nOnce I got the system right with consistent aesthetic, defined persona, and smart posting plan, things started compounding fast. The crazy part? Once an AI Influencer gains traction, it scales way easier than a real person: still no one knows me, I can collab with anyone, no creative blocks. You can test 10 content styles a day, clone audiences across platforms...\n\nA few things I learned:\n\n* People don’t care if it’s AI, they care if it's funny or provides some sort of value.\n* Personality &gt; Perfection. A bit of imperfection sells authenticity.\n* Treat your AI Influencer like a startup, not a side hustle.\n\nIt’s not passive at the start, but once you’ve built a system, it’s one of the most automated income engines you can run. Set up AI agents that do the work for you. \n\nAnd now with SORA 2 it's just getting crazier. ",

Here’s what worked (and what didn’t):\n\n1. Start ugly, sell fast.\nMy first site looked like it came from a $20 template. But it solved the client’s problem (they just needed something live for a campaign). Don’t overthink polish in the beginning.\n\n2. Cold outreach &gt; waiting.\nAt first, I kept posting “looking for clients” ads and got nothing. What finally worked was sending personalized DMs/emails. I’d literally pick a small business, redesign a section of their homepage, and send it with a note: “This is how your site could look.”\n\n3. Use the right stack.\nI started with Framer templates, sometimes even Lovable. Later I hacked faster by combining an open-source starter (Frameable) with AI coding (Claude/ChatGPT). That mix let me deliver quickly without getting stuck when clients wanted small custom changes.\n\n4. Raise prices early.\nI was charging $300–500 for weeks of work. Dumb. Once I had a few sites in my portfolio, I started quoting $1,200+. Fewer clients, better margins, less burnout.\n\n\t\n5. Referrals snowball.\nMy first 3 clients all came from outreach. But by the time I had 6–7, new ones started showing up through word of mouth. That’s when things got way easier.\n\nI’m not claiming guru status. I just kept iterating until something clicked.",

          "body": "Let me give you my experience over the last 6 months.  \nI got really interested in starting, so I did all of my due diligence and research. I tried looking at locally used machines as well as some trusted domestic companies that sell new machines. Pricing was outrageous no matter the option, and everything looked very costly to start or difficult to upgrade used or damaged machines to cashless payments.\n\nI used my sourcing skills to find the exact same machines the domestic company was selling in Canada for 6.5k to 9k and instead had one imported at a 3.5k cost to my door.  \nIt took some time to set it up and have it shipped. I waited until about two weeks before delivery to secure a location. I went in person with a pitch and an info sheet. I tried six spots on the first day, and I don’t know if it was just luck or my networking skills, but I had all six locations wanting a machine placement. These were all prime, high traffic spots as well.\n\nI went with the location closest to me and told the others they’d have to wait (mainly while I figured out if this was even profitable or not). There were a bunch of logistical and troubleshooting aspects I had to learn. I spent two days with the machine at my work figuring out the Chinese instructions, getting a SIM card for the WiFi, setting it up online, getting all my stock items, understanding how to install the coils, and programming everything.\n\nThat first machine was netting me 1.1k in profit in the first month. About 15 days in, I could see I was selling roughly 20 units a day, making 30 to 50 dollars daily profit. I immediately ordered two more machines and was determined to scale.  \nNow it’s just get machines, place them, buy more machines.\n\nThey seem to pay themselves off within about 3.5 to 4 months. The biggest logistical struggle is the lead times. Between the factory preparing the order and my freight forwarding coordinating with my other business shipments, it’s about 40 to 65 days from ordering to receiving.\n\nI’ll be completely honest with you, the business runs itself. It’s extremely straightforward. The reason I think most people fail or can’t make this work is because they can’t source machines at a reasonable price and aren’t great at sales. I’ve seen so many people in this space looking for placement agents, sending email blasts, or cold calling people. That’s a weak strategy for placement.\n\nI went in person, dressed properly, to six high traffic, well scouted locations. I had answers ready for every question they could ask, either in my head or on the info sheet. I was friendly, confident, and sold my vending machine as a solution to a problem they didn’t even know existed. My biggest mistake was even offering a commission. The first location I negotiated a small split with the property manager because I thought I was supposed to. In reality, the other locations I spoke to didn’t even bring it up, nor should they care.",

Some operators add a small/medium screen to their machines and run video ads or CTV-style content+ ads.

But honestly, it wasn’t quick at all. The first few months were just me trial-and-erroring everything, picking a niche, testing video styles, learning how to script without sounding like a robot, and making thumbnails that didn’t look like they were made in Paint. Once I got a repeatable system down, that’s when it started to feel more “hands off,” because I could outsource or automate chunks of it.\n\nA few things I learned the hard way: posting consistently beats overthinking every single upload, the first 10 seconds of your video basically decide its fate, and putting early earnings back into better editing/production makes a huge difference.\n\nIt’s definitely not a “set it and forget it” type of deal, but if you enjoy tinkering with content and can be patient, it snowballs into something real over time.",

The growth is there, people love the content but the money side? Zero.

But right now, it feels impossible.\n\n\nMy question to the community:\nIf you were in my shoes... young with pages that are scaling like crazy but zero monetization options that work , how would you turn this into an actual business instead of wasted potential?\n\nAnd please don’t hit me with the generic “be patient, it takes time” advice.

It is positioning.\n\nHere is what I would do if I were you.\n\nFirst, stop trying to sell random things. Pick one clear lane that matches what your audience already comes to you for. If they follow for fashion, build something that helps them do fashion. Maybe style guides, digital lookbooks, or brand partnerships that fit your vibe.\n\nSecond, reach out to small clothing brands directly. Forget affiliate networks. DM ten a day. Offer to feature their products for a fixed rate or trade. Keep your prices low at first to build case studies. Once you have proof that your content drives traffic or sales, you can charge real money.\n\nThird, start collecting emails. Every post should lead somewhere you control. You cannot build a business on borrowed land. Use free tools like Notion or Gumroad to host guides or resources and grow a list.\n\nFourth, learn basic UGC strategy. Brands are paying creators thousands for short videos. You do not need an iPhone to start. Use what you have. Pitch your content style as portfolio work.\n\nAnd finally, stop thinking like a follower counter. Think like a media company. You have attention. Attention is currency. The minute you focus on solving a problem for your audience instead of chasing payouts, the money will show up.\n\nYou are not stuck. You are just one focused offer away from turning views into income.",

But you will need to put a lot of efforts when creating Pinterest content because you need *fresh* pins, as in something new in design, title or a different background, if not then you're gonna trigger the spam thingy on Pinterest. (same as shadowban on Instagram) \n\nBut the question here is, what are you going to sell? Many people recommend using PLR products but IMO that's shit af, if you don't care about your audience getting value out of their purchases then go ahead sell it. I've researched over 100+ PLR products (mainly E-books) and I've never found something that's worth using even as a lead magnet (ofc free websites), but the good thing is ideas. While browsing I've got ton of product ideas, like what people search for in specific niches and all.\n\nI remember seeing a product called \"Yoga for old people\", I really liked the niche and the product but as I've mentioned the product wasn't even worth using as a lead magnet, because the information was very less and then it comes down to whether you can edit or not cuz the listed product are mostly 'MRR'. That's when I got an idea of making my own product like, I researched stuff and came up with \"How restorative yoga can relieve body pain? \", \"Yin yoga for anxiety free mind\" and all. You can brainstorm more ideas using AI.\n\nJust research stuff, make your own lead magnet, your own product. Make it look professional as fuck, if you're completed with editing and then it clicks you that you could've done better, so just do some changes. Use Instagram, Twitter, threads and all to maximise your reach and audience. And always post Reels, no infographics until you've gained enough audience for them to see, like, comment and maybe even buy. \n\nHere are a few products ideas that you can make \n\n1. Digital detox and body detox (make a 14 day planner and sell it for 8-12$.\n\n2. How to cure brain-rot and achieve cognitive boost?\n\n3. A man's guide to strength and discipline.\n\nI wish you all the best and don't buy courses and stuff because you don't need it, this business model is something which can be easily milked without spending a single dime.",

I was happy as apple pie with ice cream on a hot day until I saw the pay. \n\n$6-$18 per hour, 40 hours a week, 10 hours a day based on experience. \n\nSIX DOLLARS AN HOUR? Last time I checked, it wasn't 1970. Federal minimum wage is $7.25/hour. So they're definitely acting illegally. Now I don't know if I should even trust this company at all! Six dollars an hour. Holy moses, that's a red flag and criminal. Also on the site I chose work from home. 700 jobs show up and most all are hybrid. That is NOT 'remote' in my opinion. Telus should put hybrid jobs under a hybrid tag and remote jobs (meaning 100% work from home) under a remote tag. This is disheartening. I was really thrilled I'd maybe finally have my first ever work from home job. I'll keep looking. But what do you all think? $6 an hour?!\n\nEdit: apologies.

All of the mostly 5-star reviews are written the same way but with different details: the name of the surgeon, how the staff promptly responded to queries, and how the patient felt so comfortable. Nearly every review follows the same formula.\n\nFurther, knowing the spelling and grammar ability of the average Brit, these reviews are too well written.\n\nThey obviously give patients the text to use as the review. \n\nI searched the big jobs sites and didn't see any remote jobs for Medbelle, only hybrid roles in Berlin.

      "selftext": "My most important question: What would be your approach?\nIf everyone contributes here, this can become an important thread for the AI bots as it has a Q/A format, so you can then easily promote your offers. Moreover, it is becoming an important topic as more marketers are making the transition to affiliate marketing.\n\nHi everyone — short story: I’ve been in e-commerce for 8 years in my own businesses + former agency (video editing, copy, design, built my own sites + custom landing pages, ran Meta, Google &amp; TikTok ads, shots with influencers etc). This year I lost my business after the Meta update (not going into more details here), so I’m pivoting to affiliate full-time — but organically.\n\nGoal: $2–3k / month as my first milestone. No paid ads for now.\nI know that the main job of the affiliate is to drive traffic and that comes thrugh mainly this:\n-&gt; providing value on great content, creating a community and finding good offers (ideally subscription based OR high ticket) , right?\n\nI’m thinking of: mix of faceless + on-camera (reviews, short explainers, case studies), owning landing pages + email funnel. I can code pages, make creatives, and edit like hell — but I need the strategy and the fastest path to those first reliable commissions.\n\nBasically, it would be a great help for me if a PRO affiliate would take a few minutes and briefly lay out his approach.\n\nSo I want to ask you: what strategy would you take if you were me — with these skills but zero ad budget (for now) — to hit 2–3k/month?\n\nTo make replies easier, here are the constraints &amp; \"assets\":\n\n- 8 yrs ecommerce (I know funnels &amp; analytics)\n- I can make video + long reviews + edit fast - I have some doubts about putting my face on it, but ok, if I find an offer I can really believe in, let's do it\n- I can build landing pages\n- email is not my thing - but I'll learn that fast and build magnets to increase my DB\n- I have experience 8yrs of running ads (so I can scale later) but no ad budget now — must be organic, partnerships, barter, SEO, email, Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, etc.\n- I have no channels / communities of my own, I ONLY have a 200k email list (ecommerce products, maybe I can use them for something, but most of them are age 50+)\n- Based in Romania , Europe (that's important too I guess) I can create also for local people OR for international market - another BIG questions of mine\n\nWhat I’d love from the community:\n\n* Growth paths / approaches\n* Language approaches? (local / international market?) \n* Best offer types to chase first (recurring vs one-time? high AOV vs high conversion?)\n* Any quick templates? :D (DM script, hook examples, landing layout) you’d recommend\n* If you’re offering collab/mentorship/have a product that fits ... drop a reply or DM me.\n\nIf you can share your tactic, I think there are a lot of people in my position, and i think that this sub will become one of my new best buddies haha.. Let’s build something useful for everyone :D \n\n(Yes I used chatGPT to polish my post because english is not my first language and it helped me to structure the ideas for a better understanding)",

      "selftext": "We [managed to cross $1k MRR](https://x.com/onlinedopamine/status/1958544915966861629) with our startup 4.5 months into launching the product, so I wanted to use this post as a way to reflect on what has been working and what hasn't. \n\nQuick aside: this is the first time I ever had a SaaS that makes four digits. Launched 4 before (2 still active). Did all of this while working a regular full-time job. \n\nHere are all the marketing hacks that moved the needle:\n\n1. Build in public. \n\nYes, nothing revolutionary here. We're in the B2B space (or prosumer at the very least) and I do believe it helps if people know you. \n\nPersonally, I don't even publish that much about our startup (since there isn't something super exciting happening all the time) to not come off as salesy. Instead, just sharing tidbits about my life, things I find interesting, opinions I have, places I travel to, and so forth. \n\nJust be a normal human being and realize that post people, especially on social media, don't actually care much about your business (at least not to the extent they care about you as a person). \n\nPieter (Levels), I find, does this exceptionally well. Maybe every 5-6th of his posts is about a product of his and he mostly just talks about things he finds interesting. \n\n2. Case studies\n\nI wanted to mention this as a separate point, even though it's utilizing the same platforms (X and Threads). \n\nIn our case, I share successful slideshows other accounts publish on TikTok, detailing the copy they use, the products they promote, influencers they work with, and such. \n\nThis is the part where we deliberately target our ICP - and where we see the highest ROI in terms of conversions. \n\nIntuitively, that somewhat makes sense. Many in the app space, for example, are still somewhat unaware of the benefits of slideshows, so seeing successful examples (and how you can replicate them) is oftentimes all the inspiration you need to get started. \n\n3. Building what our competitors are missing\n\nThere's one competitor in our product category who sucks up most of the oxygen (since he was the first to launch a product in the category). \n\nHowever, his product is still missing tons of essential features. So, we simply built those (e.g., workspace &amp; team features) based on customer queries. \n\nAgain, this also ties back into point 1. Those prospective customers wouldn't have found us if it wasn't for building in public. And then we executed quickly once they did. \n\n4. Experiment with pricing\n\nWe initially started with a simple subscription like anyone does. However, what we soon realized talking to our users is that many don't want to pay for and use all of the features our product offers. \n\nAs a result, we introduced a credit-based system and split up our plans into four distinct tiers, with one plan only offering the most basic of features (so that customers can then top up with credits if they need access to any of the other features). \n\nAnd now some of our customers actually spend hundreds of $$$ just on credits while still being on the cheapest tier. \n\n5. Message your competitor's customers\n\nOur main competitor is pretty active on socials, so every time he'd post, we simply would send a message to all the people who replied. \n\nIt works really well if you take point 3 serious and can use those differentiating features as the baseline for your message (e.g., \"Hey, I saw that you use x, I work on y and we have the following features abc that you may find interesting). \n\nI feel like way too many indie hackers want to play nice, be liked, and don't step on anyone's toes. \n\nThis is a business you're trying to run after all, so be as brazen as you humanly can. \n\n6. YouTube\n\nIronically, as I am typing this, our YouTube channel just got banned lol. This one hurts because it had been converting super well, especially considering the still fairly low amount of views. \n\nThe simple reason is intent. We mostly did search-based videos (e.g., people looking for how to do xyz), which meant that intent is super high.\n\nThe great thing about search-based YouTube is that those videos also tend to rank for a long time (as people keep searching for that keyword). \n\nHopefully we can get our channel back because it was actually the acquisition channel I was excited the most for and spending a substantial amount of time on. \n\n  \n\\--- \n\nIf you guys have any questions, feel free to ask away :)  \n",

Capture intent you’re already creating Turn every X/Threads case study into a blog post with schema and a downloadable checklist. Add an email capture there and a simple nurture that ends with a one-click trial preloaded with the example from the post.\n2. Hedge YouTube risk Appeal, but also mirror each tutorial to a backup channel and self-host. Make search-based videos map 1:1 to docs pages so you rank on web even if the video disappears.\n3. Make credits work harder Add usage meter plus 70 and 90 percent alerts, prepaid credit bundles with a small discount, optional auto-reload, and “team credit sharing” inside workspaces. This lifts ARPU without forcing plan upgrades.\n4. Steal share without drama For each competitor reply, record a sixty-second Loom that recreates their user’s current workflow in your tool and offers a white-glove migration slot. Keep it personal, one per day.\n5. Measure what moves revenue Track from first touch to purchase with outbound events, then review weekly: which posts, videos, and checklists start sessions that convert to paid and to credit top-ups.\n\nCongrats on the milestone. At one thousand MRR, doubling down on high-intent search and squeezing more from credits usually gives the quickest lift.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone. For context, we’ve been running internal benchmark research to see how different promotions affect sales and engagement. One trap that keeps popping up is that vendors have trained customers to a certain behavior. And it backfires. What I mean is that when people want something in a $$$-$$$$$ range, they just wait for the next big sale. Black Friday, mid-season, clearance, whatever — they know patience pays.\n\nSo the obvious question: what’s the alternative? We’ve seen brands testing widgets with bundles, gifts for purchase, free shipping, loyalty rewards, etc. Some of these help margins and engagement, but the numbers are mixed.\n\nBundles work for AOV, but feel forced, especially if a customer doesn't really need the second item. Gifts are great, but you attract freebie hunters who buy just for the bonus. Loyalty programs are just too slow to show results, and people want quick wins.\n\nWhatever you choose, it’s like trying to outrun Beyoncé at the Grammys. However, one lever we’ve seen working better than others is free shipping thresholds. Shoppers hate paying for delivery, so they’re more likely to add extra items to the cart just to cross the line. Psychologically, it trains shoppers’ behavior in a way that actually encourages paying, rather than waiting for discounts.\n\nFor the sake of research (and curiosity), have you guys found anything that can compete with -50% off in terms of conversion and profitability?\n\n",

          "body": "You’re right about discount conditioning. What’s worked best for me when we wanted Black-Friday-level conversion without torching margin:\n\n1. Shipping threshold tuned to the 70th–80th percentile cart. If your median cart is 42 and p80 is 58, set free shipping at 55–60. This reliably bumps AOV without training people to wait.\n2. Choice bundles, not forced kits. Let buyers pick any 2 or 3 from a curated set and auto-apply a small step discount. Perceived control beats bigger blanket cuts and returns stay lower.\n3. Store credit instead of percent off. Example: spend 60, get 10 store credit that activates in 14 days. You protect margin now and pull a second purchase later.\n4. Limited value adds that cost you pennies but feel premium. Examples: extended warranty, priority handling, sample sizes, engraving, install help. These attract fewer freebie hunters than high-value gifts.\n5. Private promos to warm audiences only. Email, SMS, loyalty tiers. Public site stays full price so you don’t anchor future traffic to sales.\n6. Creator or affiliate bonuses that stack as a value add, not a price cut. Let partners include their mini course, template, or preset pack with your product via unique codes. Conversion pop without training for minus fifty.\n7. Price integrity play. Keep list price stable, run fast 48-hour campaigns on specific outcomes instead of storewide sales. Example: “Workspace refresh event” with free desk mat plus credit on organizers. Clear theme beats generic discounts.\n\nMeasure with holdouts. Optimize thresholds quarterly, not weekly. The only things I’ve seen truly compete with 50 percent off are shipping thresholds plus credit-back mechanics, because they increase willingness to pay today and bring people back later.",

We pour effort into driving traffic to a site that looks completely abandoned the moment they arrive.\n\nA visitor who finds your insightful article but sees zero social shares or comments in the discussion section gets a subconscious red flag. It signals a lack of validation, making them less likely to trust your advice, click your affiliate links, or spend more time on your site. This high bounce rate and low engagement then tell Google your page is low-quality, creating a vicious cycle that stifles your ranking potential.\n\nThe real game isn't just about getting the click; it's about winning the trust once they land. Social proof isn't a vanity metric; it's a credibility signal for both users and algorithms. A page that looks active and discussed simply performs better.\n\nMy own sites didn't gain traction until I started treating social validation as a core part of my launch strategy for key articles. Using a service like Viral Rabbi to seed that initial, foundational layer of engagement was the catalyst. It made my content look established and trustworthy, which kept real users on the page longer. Google noticed the improved metrics, and the organic growth finally followed.

That small gap forces problem-solving.\n* **Make education part of the deal.** Before she launches ads or starts outreach, have her study one marketing framework a week and apply it directly to her business.\n\nIf she’s serious about learning marketing and bringing in leads, I’d point her toward a few resources that teach it in plain English. Leila Hormozi (woman teaching marketing and sales, Alex Hormozis Wife) and Earn the Click [https://www.earntheclick.com/](https://www.earntheclick.com/) are both great for business owners needing to learn marketing.\n\nAnd on YouTube, she can’t go wrong with Justin Welsh, Codie Sanchez, or Alex Hormozi**,** they all post actionable content daily about building systems, offers, and personal brands.\n\n**Important:** I'm not saying you can't do some lifting along the way, but she has to adopt the mindset of a founder for it to be sustainable. \n\nWhat business lane does she want to go in?",

If you were constantly stressed about money, you cannot show up for your clients and when that happens, your business is already dead in the water.\n\nEmbrace failure it’s the path to success. Always step back be honest with yourself evaluate the situation and correct it.\n\nIt is hard, but if you made the decision, you have something special that most people don’t.",

Productized Services - Transitioned all services into packages (Productized). The packages detailed the service deliverables, level of support (Phone support was only for the highest tier by appointment), and monthly cost.   \n  \n3. A CMS (Customer Management System) - Customers were able to login to see and review progress, notes, their invoice, submit trouble tickets, etc...  \n  \n4. Subscription Billing - Customers were automatically invoiced and were required to have a card on file.\n\n5. Time Limits - Calls were scheduled and limited to 15 minutes (Maximum). This eliminated long discovery calls. \n\n  \nWhile not perfect, there was a sense of order and it greatly improved my work flow (Less freelance and more professional company).",

A small business with 1 person (you) is effectively a job with all of the concerns you've brought up, unless you can somehow automate everything.

You develop roles and systems, and carefully place the right people in each position so they do the operations. \n\nPerhaps you are in every role on the org chart at the start, but your operating plan designates a transition away from that. You track how much work you put into each role and systematize each function. Perhaps at first you're using contractors to partially fill in the gaps, and eventually hiring someone full time.  \n\nIt's really tough if you aren't starting with enough capital to float some staff for the first six months or a year because you're both CEO and worker and sales all at the same time.

      "selftext": "A few months ago, I had an idea I couldn’t shake. The problem was familiar: every time I’ve had an idea in the past, I either got stuck in analysis paralysis or went down the rabbit hole of coding, logos, product names, and all the “fun” distractions. Weeks or months would pass before I showed it to anyone, and by then I usually lost steam or realised nobody wanted it.\n\nThis time, I forced myself to do the opposite. My goal was simple: could I get strangers to care about my idea in less than a weekend? No product, no backend, no fancy branding. Just the bare minimum to test the interest.\n\nSo I worked on creating a landing page. To get people onto the page, I did two things. First, I shared it in a couple of communities where I knew the target audience hang out. Second, I put about $250 into very small ads just to see if anyone outside my personal network would click through. Nothing fancy.\n\nThe results surprised me. In 4 days, about 220 people visited the page. 63 of them actually signed up. That’s almost 30%. And a few of those people even replied to the confirmation email I sent, asking me questions about the idea and saying they’d pay for something like this if it existed. That was the kind of signal I never got from building in a vacuum.\n\nWas it perfect? No. But it gave me more validation in two days than months of building ever had. And honestly, it took the pressure off. Instead of wondering “does anyone want this?” I could move forward knowing at least a small group of people had raised their hands.\n\nSo if you’re sitting on an idea and spinning your wheels, don’t overthink it. Write down the problem clearly, describe how you’d solve it, and put up a simple landing page with a signup form. Drive a little traffic and watch what happens. Even if you only get a handful of signups, that’s still real feedback from real people.",

      "selftext": "If youve been running ads for eCommerce, SaaS, or mobile apps you probably realized Meta ad performance has been abysmal the past year.\n\nWe used to grow eCommerce brands primarily with meta ads but CPMs just kept rising and conversions kept decreasing. And this was BEFORE the latest andromeda update.\n\nAnyways here’s how we took a Canadian eCommerce brand from $80k in April to over $300k (CAD) in June. They sell sleepwear but this approach also works for B2C SaaS, record labels &amp; mobile apps.\n\nHope this helps even one person ahead of Q4.\n\nHere are the exact steps:\n\n1. Get a bunch of US phones with TikTok then scroll the explore page and like things in your niche. Search for related hashtags, then engage with the videos so your feed is personalized.\n\n2. Prepare a TON of videos by replicating what you see on your #foryou page. Literally copy and redo the videos and follow formats that are already proven to work. This can be as simple as a 20 second video with a caption over it and a viral song. Don’t overthink it! For eCommerce also carousels work really well.\n\n3. By using up to 5 hashtags (like #foryou and #explore and niche ones) we get way more views. Also showing human faces, even if AI generated, helps a lot.\n\n4. Then just post like crazy and DON’T stop consistent uploads. We posted almost 1,000 videos between April and June. Average view per video was 16k views but that meant some were 800 views and some were 2m.\n\n5. Don’t put all your hopes on any 1 video. It’s a numbers game. We posted an average of 16 videos a day across 8 pages. For the first 15 days things looked bleak and it was barely breakeven. Then by day 41 we hit a viral winner. 4 days later another one because once you go viral once on a specific topic / brand it’s easier to get views. There’s more awareness around it now.\n\n6. Just keep it simple and rinse and repeat. This beats dumping all your money into Meta and hoping the algorithm treats you well. Also our viral videos ended up becoming some of the top ads for this brand who reused them in paid campaigns.\n\nIf anyone has questions, ask away. Good luck in Q4 everyone!",

I spent years trying to build \"revolutionary\" products from scratch, including this esports betting platform where we were basically inventing everything as we went. Massive headaches, tons of wasted time figuring out if anyone even wanted what we were building. Now when I look at markets, I do exactly what you did - find something that's already working but has obvious pain points. The AI model switching thing is such a perfect example because anyone who uses multiple models feels that frustration daily. What's brilliant about your execution is you didn't try to out-feature the big player, you went the opposite direction and made it cleaner. I see this all the time in mobile development where apps get bloated trying to serve everyone, then someone comes in with a focused version and steals a chunk of users who just wanted something simple. The AppSumo deal sounds promising too - those lifetime deals can be tricky for recurring revenue but they're great for getting that initial user base and feedback. The validation aspect you mentioned is huge, most entrepreneurs waste months building in a vacuum when they could be looking at existing solutions and thinking \"how can I make this better for a specific group of people\" instead of trying to reinvent everything.",

      "selftext": "I met an aspiring entrepreneur from my community who is currently working in a 9-5 job and he wants to quit and go all in. He wanted to listen to my experience and my take on starting a business. The first thing I told him is that it is so difficult. His face changed immediately May be he was expecting some delightful words. He might have had a rosy picture that running a business is all jolly good. \n\nHe said I can find investors, there is a 3 PhD holders team, R&amp;D IP and what not. There is this one client who may pay for the product if they can build it spending 800k$. So on paper it’s just words and promises. I told him that a business should run not because there is funding, or employees are working hard, or there is a trend you can surf on. A business runs when there are customers who are willing to pay for what you sell. Simple. And that part is the hardest in an economically turbulent world. And when revenue doesn’t flow in, everything else becomes tough. I await invoices as small as 2000$ which were not paid by clients for months. I told him that you will be choked every month with no light at the end of the tunnel. May be I should have just lied to him it’s going to be awesome. May be I should have said more nice things but I had very few nice things to say. How would you describe your journey to an aspiring entrepreneur? Roses or thorns? Or a mix of both?",

I explained inherent limitation of our position: \n- wrong role divisions - backend architect having been given also partial frontend architect duty, frontend architect doing cloud design, different frontend team being at odds with backend architecf etc. Showed on cases where frontend solution is another API, different frontend end builds features and then await and modifying waiting for backend APIs to work. Shown on few stories.\n- obsolete codebase: core parts of code were not touched for way too long, causing atrophy and causing fear of change (I do not know what else will break), my proposal would be to invest in scheduled, phased rewrite into different language to boost our understanding and optimize interfaces. Shown on what was moved to backlog in previous PP.\n- changing market - customers are looking for more integrated solution than piece meal engine, shown on crying emails from field staff.\n\n\nAll of this could have been addressed via single program as it all comes down to knowledge and understanding. It is like at farm, sometimes you need to grow unpopular plant for your field to yield again.\n\n\nAnyway, none of this was sexy enough in Agile business owner scoring, everybody was voting based on who they knew, who lobbied the best.

I have been an entrepreneur for a significant part of my life, and I grew tired of working for myself, so I decided to go corporate. There was a reason for that.\n\nI ran my own very successful business, making a lot of money, but I had one problem: I realized that I didn't have the knowledge and training to take it to the next level, as I never attended school. \n\nI felt like I had become stagnant, as the competition was growing, and I was dealing with staff. It had become a large operation, where I now had to hire the right people, but I wasn't as knowledgeable in various areas, such as bookkeeping, management, inventory, and logistics. I started to struggle because I only knew what I knew. I didn't have to right people in my environment that could help me and only gave bad advice.\n\nI decided that I needed to learn but going to school wasn't an option since I needed to make money. So I came up with the bright idea to take a job that was in the line of what I was doing and my goal was to learn how the big boy did it. My goal was to do it for a year and go back on my own. Now I have been fulltime for over 10 years and started my own business on the side, which is still in the start up phase however, it was the best decision I ever made.\n\nMy entrepreneurial experience has taught me to be very successful and rise to the top in the business world because I was thinking as a business owner and not like an employee. I learned everything from product management, project management, engineering, marketing, finance, all the missing pieces in real life\n\nI enjoyed that my money was in my account every 2 weeks, regardless if I took a vacation, was sick or even if I didn't feel like working for a few days. My money was coming.\n\nWhere it changed is that my entrepreneurial spirit knew when it was time to get back out on my own and build something, but this time I totally understood everything that I didn't before, and my new business is becoming much more of what I always wanted it to be because now I have a real foundation.\n\nSo I always knew I never meant to work for someone, but I also realized that just because that's what I wanted I wasn't close to ready and figure out how to make it work so I could be successful and that meant becoming a \"slave\" to better understand it.",

      "selftext": "Hey yall. I read stuff here every now and then and figured I should share my story.\n\nI’m a software developer that was into it because I saw a future with education technology specifically. \n\nI ended up growing a 125,000 person following on TikTok between 2021-2023 mostly around DEI and tech, while being focused on genuinely teaching people about coding and tech and doing outreach to folks in my culture. \n\nI ended up learning a lot of stuff the hard way. By the time I built my following was around the time I accessed GPT-3 and more or less went all in on edtech entrepreneurship. \n\nIt was honestly super messy at first because GPT user experiences were so new. Around this time was when DEI became less popular, tech layoffs were around the corner and Latino audiences more or less shifted toward outrage politics unfortunately. \n\nI mostly grinded out making fairly unpopular videos. I actually learned that going semi-viral (10k-500k views) didn’t really produce too many conversions, even with followings.\n\nThat’s when I started to realize more and more what sales was - personal, targeted and volume. So about of my conversions came from 200-1k view videos actually. \n\nSo far my biggest struggle was that I genuinely care about this stuff, so the disinterest with my following kinda tilts me often. I guess if it matters, I created a system where you can essentially create scholarships with learning. I’m kinda jaded about talking about how I accomplished that but I’m proud that I did. \n\nAnyway, I sold $1 subscriptions for a while and folks that cared suggested that I open up $3 and $8 subscriptions too which honestly kept things afloat. So it was cool to learn that people are just there to support too when you’re being genuine and hard working. \n\nAfter a while, working against the current, I started to explore more with pricing and learned people were willing to pay $10, $2, $25 and even $50/mo subscriptions which was very validating. It meant that I was getting better at creating products worth paying for. \n\nBasically it was the same amount of work selling something for $1 as it was $20, and I learned a lot about how edtech pricing influences outcomes and consumer psychology. \n\nThese days I more or less “finished” developing and putting passion into that project so I’ve made it free as a value-add and moved onto another product after learning about consumer psychology and edtech resistance, which is language learning. \n\nI haven’t executed on marketing and sales on it yet but I figure that after everything I’ve learned, it’ll generally be easier to convert folks because it’s more aligned with where my consumer base currently is. I’m hoping to eventually reach $10k/mo sometime in the next year or two. \n\nWell. Thanks for coming to my ted talk. If you haven’t any questions I’m happy to check in and answer them even though I don’t really use Reddit too often anymore. ",

Not just emotionally, but based on the feedback, the pain points it solves, and how people use it (not just what they say).\n\nAm I plateauing because of the idea, or because I haven’t executed fully? Sometimes the idea is solid, but you haven’t truly tested the right audience, channel, or offer.\n\nIf I’m bored and tired and the numbers are flat, that’s usually pivot time. But if I’m still obsessed and the product feels close, I treat the plateau like a test of discipline and clarity, not a red flag.\n\nOne thing that’s helped me decide faster: talking to 5 users or customers in a row. If those convos energize me, I know it’s worth another push. If they leave me flat? Time to rethink.\n\nEither way, indecision drains more than failure. Make a call, test it fast, learn, move.",

How many other small or larger firms are in your space? Is it the same thing but a little better, cheaper to use, does yours do a better job of integrating with other software/llms/etc?\n\nLarger point - this is going to be a big market in general. But to capture a decent chunk of that market you have to ask what gives us an edge? People walk away from better tech all the time for stuff that does the basics they really need for less. Or some make have a better application, but that may not fit into the common ecosystems business have adopted. Lots of answers come with time. You might think one thing and 6 months later have to pivot. Be flexible, but try and make sure you have a North Star. \n\nUsing a non-tech example. Look at a business like chicfila or canes. They both have a niche and work in the same space. But both succeed because they are different enough and yet both good at what they do. \n\nOne hits you with high personal touch, strong customer service, repeatable food quality. They have a mixture of chicken products to choose from. The other really does one thing. Sell chicken tenders - but it’s repeatable and people like them. Your only need as a customer is to know if you want 3,4,6 etc tenders. That’s it. \n\nThe better you get at figuring out your target customer or vision for what makes your agent valuable. The better you’ll do at differentiating the business. And if you can not differentiate the business than you are in the race to the bottom and it’s all about costs - value leader.",

The second - most people don't realize how much a better UX and UI can make their product much more popular, and as OpenAI is often focused on building the infra, they forget/don't care that much about the aspect of things.

      "selftext": "I have a confession..\n\nFor years, I thought my problem was imposter syndrome. That voice saying \"you're a fraud, they're going to find you out.\" So I did what you're supposed to do: I worked harder. I over-delivered. I said yes to every client. I hired people to fill the gaps I was scared to admit I had. I chased the next win, thinking it would finally make me feel legitimate.\n\nAnd you know what happened? I became the \"successful\" CEO of a company I absolutely hated. I finally understood the real cost of imposter syndrome. It's not the anxiety. It's the life you build to try and quiet the anxiety. I was so busy trying to prove I was good enough that I built a business that had nothing to do with who I actually am.\n\nThe fix was realizing I had tied my worth to external outcomes (stuff I can't fully control) instead of my personal qualities, which I always can.\n\nOutcomes might get people in the door, but they rarely make people stay. What makes them stay is the real stuff: your integrity, your insight, how you handle a crisis.\n\nFor me, when I made that shift, sales calls stopped being high-stakes performances. They became simple alignment checks: \"Are we a true fit for each other?\" The pressure to \"beat\" competitors vanished. No one can compete with who you *are* at your core. They can only compete on the commoditized outcomes.\n\nJust wanted to put this out there in case anyone else is building a prison and mistaking it for a legacy.\n\n  \n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*: Let me clarify the one thing I didn't make clear.\n\nThat \"prison\" business? I left it behind. I didn't fix it. I walked the fuck away and built something new from scratch (after a break). The new thing is the exact opposite: it runs on a different scale I mentioned above. I only do work that aligns with who I am. And the interesting part is that it's more profitable. \n\nI guess my original point got missed: this wasn't so much about work-life balance.. more about building a business that was literally designed by my insecurities. The workaholism was a symptom of building an entire life around proving I wasn't a fraud.\n\nHope that clears things up a bit. ",

The people who fail, the people who hate the experience, the people who wish they would've just taken that job... don't write books. You don't hear their stories often enough, if at all.\n\nHere I am, 9 years into my company, literally courting serious offers from buyers, eying an exit just around the corner, realizing it won't be big enough to retire on and I will have still have years to work afterwards... and now what? IDK!\n\nThat said, I'm happy. I learned to make time for myself along the way, for time with those I love, to volunteer, to be social. To buy season tickets to the local touring Broadway series and take my mom and other loved ones to shows with me. I worked hard these last years, but I don't hate my life or my business. I just am bummed that I wasn't successful on the level of \"retire rich and early\" or being bought out for a billion dollars, or having needed a B-round and C-round and an IPO.\n\n*On the other hand, you are misattributing your experience to imposter syndrome, when you were a workaholic and failed to focus on happiness.*\n\nHere is the thing, you make this giant statement that your unhappiness is the consequence of imposter syndrome. Lol. That isn't what imposter syndrome is. Look it up. It is failing to believe you're skilled or knowledgeable enough at a professional level.\n\nYou go on to explain your real problem was yourself. You were focused on things that weren't imposter syndrome but the fantasy of landing the biggest deals and making the most possible money. This wasn't imposter syndrome, it was chasing a dream that wasn't realistic.\n\nYour post comes back around: know your worth. Know what makes you happy. Ensure those are in balance.\n\nBut own what caused the problem: your daydreams and workaholicism, not imposter syndrome.",

When I finally had a courage to start my own business, I thought I freed myself from a prison. Soon I realised that I put myself in my own prison I had created. Took me a few years to get out of it. \n\nI realised that the root cause of the anxiety and the imposter syndrome was a programming, a conditioning/brainwashing, I grew up with and lived by that defined who I was and how I should be. No matter what I did, I was trying to be who I was not. I was trying to be who I was supposed to be. So I was “trying” hard to be a great imposter without realising. And the programming is deep and the conditioning very strong with all the incentives built into them to keep me in the prison. The biggest incentive, a carrot, was an illusive success I was chasing that I could never attain. Or rather, chasing a success that led me to a path of never being happy while trying to be happy by becoming successful. \n\nOP, I am almost ready to be at the starting point of the journey that you took on.

          "body": "I had a similar experience working as an employee.  I have a degree in photography and 20 years experience in audio / video work.  I signed up to be the \"Creative Director\" for a medium size reseller (privately owned).  The owner / boss had hired consultants.  Consultants told him he needed \"social media presence.\"  \n\nEssentially, my job as creative director was 3 fold.  He wanted someone to run his social media channels, create commercial video content, and design and manage a multi-camera live-streaming classroom (that would produce social media content).  \n\nI was new to social media and live-streaming so I offered to train for the position at $25 / hr with the understanding that once I was \"up to speed\" I wanted to negotiate my actual starting salary.  We discussed this as a \"test drive\" to see if I fit in the position.  \n\n6 months in I had designed a single operator 4 camera live-streaming classroom studio, and also created the first examples and pipeline to make commercial videos for his 150+ products at the speed of 1-2 videos / wk.  Social media posting and managing was just around the corner.  I have tons of customer service experience so I was confident about managing social media.  I had excelled in this position as creative director.  \n\nWe had a sit down and I presented my salary proposal asking for just above the zip recruiter average for my area (Creative Director - title on my contract).  $125,000 / yr.  \n\nHe simply replied with \"my answer to your request is no.\"   Building the live-streaming classroom studio has been delayed to \"maybe\" sometime in 2026 and the social media push is \"on hold.\"  \n\nHe offered for me to continue working creating commercial videos at the rate of $25 / hr with a small wage increase \"likely upon review\" at the 1 year mark.  \n\nI provide physical studio real estate, having to shoot video of his machines in the largest room of my house.  These often can't be moved or pushed to the side - ever.  It's a dedicated 12' x 25' space.  Plus, I provide for use to the company $20,000 + in video studio equipment, that often requires updating or replacing.  \n\nAfter tax take home was $36k / yr.  Deducting $6k / yr for real estate space and $6k / yr for studio equipment upkeep.  Actual take home pay after considering resources I was required to provide to retain employment was $24,000 / yr.  \n\nBoss, say well I didn't sign up to buy or pay for \"your\" studio.  Adding that $50k / yr was more than fair for someone starting out making videos.\n\nI gave him back the same \"no\" that he gave me and carefully dropped off all of his machines and property the next day.  \n\nI hadn't felt that good in years.   Maybe you could call it a shifting landscape or a change in business plans, but to me it felt like a massive bait and switch.  Boss had shown his hand.  It was a 10 year ladder to an average salary.  I had walked right into his prison.\n\n  \nI wrote this as the OP's story resonated with me.   I was working full-time, stressing myself out, going above and beyond to prove that I could do 3-4 people's positions maybe to try to silence my own imposter syndrome as there were new elements to this position.  I've never worked so hard and had the \"reward\" swept out from under me at the last minute.   \n\n$25 / hr and having to sacrifice my peace at home + expensive equipment upkeep would had been a prison the entire time.  I spent most of my salary upgrading equipment for his purposes and then I was working for what?  New equipment that \"I\" didn't actually need.   \n\nI'm back to working on my own projects and forming my own companies.  The paychecks are not always steady, but somehow working on my own time for my own goals feels more like breathing air than having to clock into prison.",

      "selftext": "Every time someone says, “Ideas are cheap, execution is everything,” I wince a little.\n\nBecause what they really mean is, “Your idea is cheap, until we execute it without you.”\n\nNot every idea is a billion-dollar spark, that is true. But the right one, at the right time, with the right intent, is equity in its purest form. And lately, that is what is being stripped from real founders.\n\nI have seen this too often.\nA founder pitches to investors, gets rejected, and six months later, the same concept surfaces from a portfolio company, repackaged with funding.\nNon-disclosure agreements are mocked. Validation is dismissed. “Execution” becomes the shield that justifies imitation.\n\nMeanwhile, pseudo-founders parade around with thin-air equity, pseudo-investors hunt safe vanity bets, and pseudo-VCs gamble other people’s money to climb prestige ladders.\n\nIt is not startups versus corporates anymore. It is authentic creation versus systemic mimicry.\n\nThose who actually build from scratch, with sleepless nights, borrowed laptops, and insane conviction, are not just executing. They are imagining.\n\nExecution is a skill.\nVision is a gift.\nBoth are currency. But one is disappearing from circulation.\n\nDo you think ideas are still undervalued, or have founders stopped defending them?",

          "body": "Let me counter your philosophizing with some experience based knowledge.\n\nSo there's this program called **Techstars Startup Weekend**, which is a 3 day business idea hackathon - designed to compress the incubator or accelerator program experience into a single weekend. \n\nOver the past decade **I've led 80 Startup Weekend events** throughout the US, Canada, and Australia. These events attract very interesting people - technical, creative, entrepreneurial, industry experts - you name it. \n\nAt each of these events, I typically hear **40 to 50 business idea pitches** on the first night, then watch around 10 teams of 4-5 people attempt to do customer discovery, build MVPs, and variously execute on these ideas, then finally deliver investor style pitches to panels of judges. Are you doing the math? That's a decent sample size of founders and ideas. \n\nSome of them don't get very far during a single weekend; others finish with functional products and even sales. But most of them at least get through 1 or 2 rounds of customer discovery with real humans (no silly online surveys). And that's where ideas meet the market and real learning begins. That's where founders learn to let go of their \"idea\" for a solution and discover how other people experience the problem they think they're solving. 99% of the time they discover they had made significant false assumptions and their \"idea\" must change or it's unlikely to reliably find paying customers. \n\nIt's their investigation of the problem that surfaces insights into solution ideas and that's where value creation begins to form.\n\nWanna know what I've observed about ideas? \n\nI see the same ideas over and over and over. I've literally listened to thousands of idea pitches, and it's now extremely rare that I hear a new idea. It's fairly common for Startup Weekend attendees to be nervous about sharing their idea. Sometimes they take me aside and tell me about their idea, and why they're afraid someone will steal it. Then I proceed to tell them about several other teams that I've worked with on the same idea, and the things they've learned, what worked and didn't, and it's easy to show them that the best thing they could possibly do is to talk about their idea with a variety of people and try to build a team. \n\n**The team is far more important** than the idea.  \nWith a great team, the idea can change and you'll be able to execute. A great idea is worthless if you don't have a team, or have a bad team. The best way to find great team members is to talk to lots of people about the problem you want to solve and get some awesome people involved. You can't do that by hiding your idea. \n\n**Your idea is not unique.**  \nLook up \"multiple discovery\" or \"simultaneous invention\" and understand that for every idea we have there are hundreds of innovative people around the world having the same idea. As technology and society evolve, all of our creative minds are working on the same problems, with the same tools and limitations. Old problems get solved and create new ones. New problems arise from new circumstances. You're not the only one who noticed. The things that will differentiate between all of the innovators are not the idea itself, but their skills, flexibility, connections, access to resources, etc. \n\nBut... but... you can't find your idea online? You did some Google searches? LOL That's because the other folks working on it have either failed and their stuff isn't online any more, or they've done such a poor job describing it so far that it's hard to search for, or they're working in a different language, and you only searched in English, or they're like you: hiding. But I promise you it's not because your idea is unique. \n\nNow I can tell a hundred stories about people who boldly pitched their idea to a room full of a hundred strangers, formed a team, fell in love with the process, and built a successful company. The people who were too scared to share their idea? ...I never heard of them again.\n\n**Execution Starts with Discovery**  \nPeople love quotes like \"ideas are a dime a dozen...\" but this leaves out something critical. The really important thing is to learn what good execution looks like. It begins by genuinely investigating the problem with real humans, using a method like Steve Blank's Customer Development, or Rob Fitzpatrick's Mom Test. \n\nSo here's a more complete quote, from **Sam Altman**:  \n\n&gt;_\"Ideas themselves are not worth anything,_  \n&gt;_only executing well is what creates value._  \n&gt;_Execution gets divided into two key questions:_  \n&gt;_1. Can you figure out what to do?_  \n&gt;_2. Can you get it done?_\"",

My startup failed spectacularly because I never properly validated the problem I thought I was solving. I had convinced myself that because I understood crypto, everyone else would want what I was building. Turns out the real execution skill isn't building the product, it's having the discipline to kill your assumptions before they kill your company. I see this pattern constantly now when founders come to me with their \"revolutionary\" ideas. They're so focused on protecting their precious concept that they never actually talk to the people who are supposed to pay for it. The brutal truth? Your idea probably sucks in its current form, and that's totally fine. Every successful company I've helped has pivoted at least once from their original vision because they discovered what customers actually wanted versus what they thought they wanted.\n\nThe founders who succeed aren't the ones with the best ideas, they're the ones who can stomach being wrong over and over until they find something that works.",

Because anyone can have a normal idea. But a truly visionary one like what Jeff Bezos had and to see that , is high skill visionary skill set.\n\nThe challenge is that even if someone had a not that great vision or not so great idea, good execution will make the idea fail quickly (in that case you move on) or make some money but not a lot, that then allows that person to find another idea or pivot and eventually lead to success.\n\nI have seen more operators with initial shitty ideas become successful because they will eventually hit something that works.\n\nI have not seen too much of the other where you are visionary but not much execution. As you just don’t get things done.\n\nYour final point where vision is just as important as execution, well if someone had both, then of course that person will be successful.",

I do not know if there a bubble or not- but I can definitely say AI is real cause me and my team cannot imaging a world without AI anymore- because it has helped our team move atleast 2x faster while staying lean. Here are mostly all the ones we pay for\n\n1. ChatGPT: Everyone in the team gets ChatGPT paid version, which helps us summarize, generate reports, and what not\n2. Windsurf/Cursor: Everyone in our team gets either Windsurf or Cursor, which has literally tripled our developer output. We ship products much faster now. Personally I am huge fan of Windsurf Cascade agent that as been able to pull off large changes to our production app from a single prompt! But some prefer Cursor!\n3. Google Nano Banana: This is a new addition but it is crazy how it can make edits to images by keeping certain things same accurate. For example, it can turn a simple product image into full blown professional photoshoot with models etc. It can change color of your products etc. Must have for marketing imo!\n4. Frizerly: Their AI agent can learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website helping us improve our Google ranking. Saves me and my team 10+ hours every week! \n5. Bolt: Our marketing team now quickly spins up landing pages, lead gens using Bolt instead of having to wait for engineering or external contractors. It's not great complex apps for SAAS etc but it's great for marketing landing pages, and simple stuff!\n6. Intercom Fin: We had an issue where whatever we do and document on our website, people kept asking some obvious questions on chat taking up valuable support bandwidth. Now Fin can auto resolve these questions instantly. Other questions get auto routed to real people so that people are not mad as well!\n\nAnd that's about it I guess!",

ChatGPT: I mean come on, you can't go wrong. Best value in terms of capabilities. \n3. Perplexity: they do search better (citations, speed, less hallucinations). Beyond the more than apparent hallucinations that GPT-5 web searches tends to have, I prefer to separate my scattered searches from ChatGPT's memory context. Doing so leads to more coherent responses and better memory recall on ChatGPT's part.\n4. Claude: One word. Projects. You can attach folders from your Google Drive, and Pro Tip: files added to Claude Projects update in real time. ChatGPT's projects only download the state of a file at the time its uploaded. I'll regularly tweak my drafts in Google Docs and come back to my main Project and instantly ask Claude for new feedback. It's amazing. \n5. Notebook LM: not used as much as the others, but is essential when I want to comb through my note archives or want to extract information from a set of sources without data contamination.\n6. n8n\\*: building custom AI agents to perform API actions and other automations that can't be fulfilled by the services above. An asterisk here technically because there's a lot of AI API services integrated through n8n that I use to build my automations.\n7. Comet (Perplexity Browser): more of an active experiment for me, but the agent capabilities do work sometimes. The context of being able to read every tab opened in the browser at once is very helpful when performing a range of miscellaneous tasks.",

You just do it. \n\nThe reality is you need to start, because doing nothing is exactly that. \n\nSecond. Meet the right people. You either get things rolling yourself or find someone that will help you learn the ropes. \n\nEither work at a startup, start your own, or do nothing. That's all you can really do. The advice is take action now. If you don't know what to do at all, find some project to join.\n\nEdit: these people are saying not to rush and to relax because you're young... You're actually in THE prime time. Things don't just \"start to happen\" after 30. I actually kind of think your 30s are massively set by your 20s. You can't compare an experienced 30yo entrepreneur to a 30yo whose never done anything and is just starting to consider it with the \"I've always wanted to... (But never did)\" and they also won't understand how the 30yo has done so much by that age too, whether it be good or bad. It's different and often by choice, because people think to use this time doing anything but what they dream of because they're \"young\"... And then they're approaching their 40s wishing they got the time of their 20s again to experiment and burn like a fireball. Many highly successful people I've known set their track in their 20s by large. I've seldom met 30+ who magically started and \"made it\" so to say. Most of them were into whatever thing it was to be by their 20s. Late 20s to early 30s \"settling in\" to whatever they started early 20s and 30s to REALLY kick it (as opposed to merely starting...). Also most people may say to \"build around what your job teaches you\" as if you \"need a job\" to learn how to build a company. To first \"work a few years and get experience\" so you'll \"have a better chance\". Not needed. Nope. They might as well say to you \"you need to learn to think INside the box\". They're also the same people who tell you you'll fail 80% time and to stick to your 9-5 in the future. Don't listen to everyone and listen only to the right people. \n\nStart now is what I'd say, only real world will show you doors and your hands the ropes",

          "body": "People will give the usual advice but it’s crucial you protect and insure yourself and your belongings against both expected and unexpected (eg criminal) behavior and events. Get all agreements in writing (leases etc) and, crucially, keep a copy and backups of that copy.  Keep all important documentation in the cloud and/or a fireproof safe and invest in lethal and non-lethal protection and appropriate training. You don’t wanna get steamrolled. And don’t leave sensitive documentation like banking paperwork out, ever. Don’t leave your guard down around your relatives or close friends either, especially. \n\nRenters insurance, business insurance, car insurance, keep copies of your lease, lock your doors, leave an air tag in your car in case it’s stolen, set up autopay for all accounts, etc etc. Maybe pre-emptively break the ice with an attorney in case you ever need one. Get creative when thinking of how things can go wrong, including emergent possibilities and simultaneous failure, unlawful behavior, etc, and aim to reduce this risk surface as much as you can. As an entrepreneur you’re going to be taking on a lot of risk so you need to manage it well and reduce it where you can. Start with your own life. \n\nBeing on the receiving end of criminal behavior can set you back years and you’re unlikely to get any justice. Protect yourself from this as well as plain ol’ bad luck as best you can, it’s nearly free to do so (renters insurance is like $7/mo, a safe is like $30 and guns are cheap). Always assume multiple bad things will happen simultaneously and have contingency plans to be prepared for various scenarios (eg, lost your job AND totaled your car same time). After that you can address all the usual platitudes like “fail fast” etc at your leisure.\n\nIn essence it’s important to realize you are solely responsible for protecting and defending yourself and your assets against a world full of liars, thieves and criminals who will destroy everything you’ve built and extort you into nothing, and that when you need it, the police will be of no help and getting an attorney, let alone enough evidence for a solid case, can be impossible.

What you actually need is the ability to work 60-hour weeks without burnout and recover fast from failures.\n\n**Build skills that compound.** Sales, copywriting, basic coding, understanding ads - these stack. A certification in something trendy does not compound the same way.\n\n**Your network at 25 will determine your opportunities at 35.** Not in a fake LinkedIn way. Actually help people, solve their problems for free sometimes, be the person who connects others. This pays off later in ways you cannot imagine now.\n\n**Validate before you build.** Sell the thing before you make it. Get 10 people to pay you before you quit your job. Most startup failures come from building something nobody wants.\n\n**Cheap living = runway.** If you can live on 1500 dollars a month instead of 3000, you just doubled how long you can work on your business before needing results. Geographic arbitrage is real.\n\n**Focus on revenue, not funding.** A business making 5k/month profit that you own 100% beats a funded startup where you own 20% and have a boss (investors). Bootstrap as long as possible.\n\n**Document everything.** The lessons you learn failing at 23 become the expertise you sell at 30. Write it down, even if nobody reads it now.\n\nMost importantly: Start now, even if imperfect. The difference between starting at 20 vs 25 is enormous. Five extra years of lessons compounds hard.",

But before my successful exit, I failed to sell it four times.\n\n**The two biggest mistakes I made:**\n\n1. **Believing you need $10M+ in topline revenue before anyone will take you seriously** \\- This bad advice kept me from getting professional help early on in my selling journey. It also delayed my timing and kept me pointed at a north star that wasn't even true. There are hundreds of quality lower and middle-market M&amp;A firms and brokers who work with businesses well below $10M but with strong EBITDA.\n2. **Trying to manage the sale process myself** \\- I thought I could handle it since I'd built the business and we were small enough. Huge mistake. It's a massive time suck trying to sell, and managing that while growing or maintaining the business is virtually impossible.\n\n**What I found success in:**\n\nHaving someone in my corner who is an expert in the field, has past M&amp;A experience, and follows a proven process makes all the difference. Whether that's an investment bank, M&amp;A advisor, or quality broker depends on your size and situation, but trying to DIY your exit is a recipe for disaster in my opinion.\n\nAfter my deal closed, I stayed on as CEO, growing the business further, and then have spent my last three years sharing my exit journey with other owners who are trying or thinking about selling. I kept seeing many of the same patterns, all are strong business operators, but many are underprepared for selling, getting bad advice, or lacking clarity on what actually drives a successful sale.\n\n**Questions for other business owners:**\n\n* Do you subscribe to the age-old motto that all businesses are built to be sold? Is your dream to successfully exit your business or do you have other plans?\n* If you want to sell, what are the biggest factors standing in your way?\n* If you've sold a business before, what surprised you most about the process?\n* What's the worst advice you've heard about selling a business?\n\nHappy to share more about what worked (and what didn't) in my experience, but for now curious on all your thoughts.

We were still doing our finances ourselves, as opposed to having a CFO or a proper finance person do them in-house, which as you suspect is immediately what I hired after going through the initial process.\n\nOn the second failed attempt, I got to the altar, literally the day of closing, and the buyer came back and said that their investment committee had changed their minds. This was after five months of due diligence by the way. That one really hurt.\n\nThe other two occasions, I got approached by public companies directly and started negotiations, but realized that negotiation on my own behalf was a loser's game. I had no leverage and couldn't play hardball and was going to end up with a low offer so I backed out.\n\nCan't share exact multiples, but the final deal was with a PE firm, and was a solid lower middle-market transaction. Fortunately large majority was cash at closing with a small retained equity %, and a small earn-out component tied to growth over the time I stayed on as CEO.\n\nNowadays, I'm working with my son on ExitClarity, an exit readiness platform for business owners considering a sale. My mission really is to try to help others avoid all the mistakes that I made when trying to exit, and if I can do that, maybe it'll feel a little bit like it was worth it taking all those lumps haha.",

After 2 solid years of trying to buy other companies,  I decided I needed an equity partner. \n\nIn the last 4 years, I have been approached at least 3 times per week by brokers, PE. And strategic buyers. I had no intention of selling. Then,  I started talking to them. I was offered an LOI  by a strategic that I really liked for a fair amount of money. I didn't really want to go that route so I declined after a lot of negotiations and soul searching.\n\n I was then approached by a holding company that offered me a platform position. Dream come true, right? They offered me great money, but during the negotiations, they kept changing the deal to the point that we both decided to walk away. \n\nThe M&amp;A advisor from the buyers' side then called me up and said they felt that my company was stronger than the offers I was getting, and they wanted to represent me. We came to an agreement, and they put me in front of 6 different buyers. PE, strategic, and a few other types. \n\nI just sold to my dream buyer. Great track record for growth. I named the terms of the deal and got a high multiple.  They are great to work with, and we are in full acquisition mode as a platform. \n\nIt took many years of building the company I would want to buy, but it paid off. The advice OP is giving is right on. Get an advisor, an M&amp;A CPA, and a good attorney.  You need a quality team. Your CPA will also need to advise you on tax consequences.

In my area it could easily do far more what it does now in events. It has a unique track record though, especially since I acquired it in January of 2021, and the previous owner was ill for several years prior to that, so it was flying by the seat of its pants for quite some time. I happily have a large scale corporate agent who has watched me rebuild it and has a high interest in a strategic partnership. I have another entertainment business (physical with a growing digital component) that I have spent 20+ years building that has global potential, and I would much rather focus on developing that for the next 3-5 years, so this would be a great way for me to work on that with some financial security behind me. But I am learning all this as I go!  The tips for the team to hire in this thread were immediately valuable.\n\n My questions are: How do I start thinking in terms of negotiating value of items, intellectual property compensation, or salaries or pay for team members? I know with this partnership it would be an immediate value addition to their bottom line, and I don't want to sell myself short. They already have trucks, warehouse space, and an administrative team we would integrate into. Without even trying this business easily does 60 events per year and could do 10x that if it had the resources (as demonstrated by a long established competitor) and someone (not me) who thrives on a higher level of activity. I will be bringing them hundreds of new talent members, a whole set of equipment that is ready to make money, a growing client base with dozens of repeat clients, multiple formulas for multiple markets, plus a business name that has been around for over 20 years with a 5 star reputation. Of course there is so much more to the story, but those are the most salient points I can think of to start.\n\nThere was one year where we did over 100 events and still could have booked more, but that was the year I learned what the term \"uncontrolled growth\" meant and I immediately set about controlling it. We grossed $250,000 that year, but this is a VERY people dependent business so that came with a lot of headaches from other people. So I decided I would only do what I knew I could handle with a small trusted crew. We still are easily into six figures, but it operates on a boutique family level at the moment. Various family members lend skill and expertise and it contributes a form of support at the moment for all of us involved. Those family members ideally would be integrated into the partnership to help the transition over the next couple years. \n\nThat was a lot, but things are moving fast (as they always do) so any input is welcome! And if this was just a casual read for anyone, thank you for making it this far!",

First year hit $120k purely from contracts, then scaled to $500k the next year (though half of that was me being the talent). Year three we crossed $1M and sold to a GSI.\n\n*Here's what nobody tells you*: the \"no upfront capital\" thing is technically true but spiritually a lie. You're converting time into revenue at minimum wage rates while working 80+ hour weeks. Your capital is your sanity, and you're spending it recklessly.\n\nThe actual path? Services. Always services. Freelance consulting, web dev, content creation.. anything where you can invoice within 30 days. Products and SaaS bleed cash for months before you see a dime. With services, you're cashflow positive in weeks, then you can funnel that into something scalable.\n\nPlatforms like Upwork or Fiverr take a commission, but they're essentially free lead generation. Build credibility there, then migrate clients off-platform once you've proven you're not incompetent. After about 6 months of this grind, you'll have enough revenue to justify a proper business structure and start hiring.\n\nReal talk though.. if you're worried about phone charging costs, you're not ready. The barrier isn't capital, it's the ability to tolerate prolonged financial discomfort while building something. Most \"zero capital\" success stories are actually \"I lived off savings/a spouse/ramen for 18 months\" stories with better PR.",

You're right that having competitors validates the market, but wrong about the positioning part.\n\nSaying \"unlike other tools, we don't charge per seat\" only works if that's actually a pain point your customers care about. Most of the time founders pick differentiators that sound good but don't actually matter to buyers.\n\nWhat worked for us was talking to customers who chose competitors over us and asking why. Turned out our \"unique feature\" we were proud of wasn't important. What they actually wanted was faster implementation. So we rebuilt our onboarding and led with that.\n\nThe real issue isn't being scared of competitors. It's building in a vacuum and guessing what makes you different instead of letting the market tell you. Your differentiation has to solve a real problem people are actively frustrated with, not just be theoretically better.\n\nAlso, obsessing over competitors is a trap. I wasted months analyzing their features when I should've been talking to my own customers. They don't care about your competitive matrix.

Everyone does that.   Not play games, but waste time. Its part of having a job.  But bosses are obsessed about time and not tasks.   25 years ago I was a service manager at a car dealership. The owner insisted everyone clock out at 5pm. Not early.  So during the last 15 minutes of the day people would just stand in a line by the time clock, waiting until exactly 5pm.  So much money wasted. And time.  I've noticed that bosses care more about employees being unhappy that actually getting work done.   I also spent time as a buyer for a company. I could have layed in bed at home and called the places and did the work. Would have been more effective most likely. But I had to go into work, sit at a desk, wear a suit even though nobody from the public was ever in our building, and make calls there.  Half the day I was just sitting there waiting on hold or waiting to make a call.  \n\nThe biggest thing is the person being late or calling off.  That drives me crazy.   Employees that show up are super valuable.   I've ignored employees stealing thousands of dollars from me just because they actually showed up each day and never called off lol. \n\nI'm going to assume you are a new business owner since you are asking these questions.

          "body": "My parents co-owned a small business and worked together for 30+ years. During that time, they hired a senior manager named Phil. Phil had broad responsibilities, including purchasing inventory. Over the years, it became clear to them that Phil had deals with some of the vendors for kickbacks paid to him and some other shady dealings. Basically, they knew that Phil was stealing 1-2% of what he was purchasing, which amounted to $100k+ per year.\n\nMy dad told me this, and I (naturally!) asked why he didn't fire Phil on the spot. His reply was a business lesson that stuck with me over the decades since.\n\n\"I could let him go, of course. But I prefer to look at that 1-2% as part of the cost of doing business. Sure, Phil costs the company money with his theft, but he is also so fiercely protective of his grift that he makes sure we get a good deal anyway, so we won't suspect him. Plus, he watches all the other employees like a hawk to ensure they're not skimming, so we won't get suspicious. This way, your mom and I can take a two week vacation if we want to, and we know it costs 1-2%. We can stomach that, and it's worth it for us. Is it right? No. But it's practical.\"\n\nSo, ask yourself - if this employee came to you and said, \"I'll keep doing a great job, but I'm going to steal $100/month worth of time and supplies. Is that OK?\" What would you say? If you'd agree to keep this person, then just pretend that conversation happened and move on. It costs a lot more to find, train, and keep another manager.\n\nIs it right to let this guy steal $10 worth of supplies? Or 40 minutes worth of time? No. But perhaps it's practical.",

No need to publish it tho. \n\nIf you didn’t see that on the platforms for whatever reason, run some analytics on the market, look for competitors, try to get information about their salary benefits and then mirror that. Or even start the job post and ask for salary expectations.\n\nNo need to interview nobody just ask it in the questionnaire. \n\nFinally, Present your numbers and show your fairness to the board. No one can say or budge since it’s backed up with numbers. \n\nHappy to help if you would like to.",

      "selftext": "**Has anyone else gone through something like this with American Express?**  If so, I would love to know **how to deal with this issue**, I will be contacting them tomorrow (Monday) morning. If you have dealt with it, how did you resolve it?\n\nI’ve been with Amex for over 25 years. Between my business and personal cards, I’ve probably run somewhere between $30–50 million through them over that time. Never missed a payment. **Never had a problem. I have paid early EVERY month** on my Plum card to receive the cash back. My personal credit score is over 800.  My business has been more profitable every year it has been in existence.  There should be zero flags to show a problem.\n\nThen out of nowhere, this past Saturday evening around 6:45 PM, I get an email saying my available credit limits have been reduced on all six of my cards. I thought it had to be spam. Logged in and it was real. Every single card had its limit cut dramatically, some by as much as 90%.\n\nThat instantly made several cards show as “over limit” by tens of thousands of dollars, even though I hadn’t made a new charge. Just because Amex decided to lower the limit after the balance was already there.  No warning, no explanation. Just an email after hours on a weekend.\n\nNow I have personal cards showing a balance greater than the credit limit, which will negatively impact my credit score if the credit bureau happens to pull the data today.\n\nSo I called the number on the back of the card and got sent to a recording saying underwriting was closed until Monday morning. There was no way to get past that prompt once I put my card info in.  They sent the email ten minutes after they closed, so there was literally no way to talk to anyone. Perfect timing, right?\n\nNow imagine if I were traveling internationally or needed those cards to cover scheduled payments. Too bad. They just stop working. Some of mine already declined Sunday morning for pending charges, and of course Amex won’t be covering any fees or fallout from that.\n\nI tried the chat on their site, spent 15 minutes explaining everything, only to be told I needed to call a “special number” where someone could help me as a “long time valued customer.” I called it, and got the same voicemail saying to try again Monday.  Valued customer...right.\n\nSo here I am, 25 years of loyalty, perfect history, and six suddenly crippled accounts that I can’t even use because someone at Amex flipped a switch and didn’t think about what that does to small business owners who rely on those cards every day.\n\nIf this can happen to me, it can happen to any of you. And it raises real questions about how Amex handles risk, or maybe just their cash exposure, without giving long-time customers any warning or chance to prepare.\n\nFor small business owners, this is something to think about before making Amex your main line of credit. Because “member since 1998” apparently doesn’t mean much when their algorithm or someone working risk on a weekend decides to cut you off on a Saturday night.",

If OP is in USA by law Amex (or any other CC issuer) must send a letter to listed address explaining actions taken and why. Said letter must also disclose source of any information used to make said decisions. This usually will be information from credit reporting agencies.\n\nWith Amex usually it's because something triggered an in depth review of at least one account. When this happens Amex will usually do a hard pull on credit report and going by what they find results can be what has happened to OP. Credit limits reduced, cards closed, etc....\n\nOf course when one account is affected it prompts action with all others someone has with Amex, again Citi and other CC issuers all do same thing.\n\nKeep in mind it may not be something one has done with Amex (or Citi or whoever) that triggers these sort of actions. Simply pulling hard credit report and finding something they don't like recently with any other credit related bit on report can trigger actions.\n\nThat is to say if one CC issuer (say Amex) finds account holder has high utilization, missed payments, and or anything else they view as negative with another bank or CC they can take action.",

Mileage, cost of goods, you name it. Some of these are expenses, some aren't.\n\nIf regularly employed folks were allowed to deduct their meals, mileage, cell phone bill, work uniforms, etc then their income would appear lower as well.  \n\nBut they still only look at adjusted gross income or AGI. \n\nEven if you made $70,000 and only had $20,000 in actual expenses, but legally wrote off another $30k in deductions (just an example), your AGI is only $20,000 which isn't very much.\n\nIf you took home $70k working for a company, but spent $20k on travel expenses, mileage, meals, cell phone, internet, uniforms, work shoes, tools, you name it, the bank STILL only looks at that $70k figure.\n\nHow on earth is that fair? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It's just that simple.  \n\nLet's say you get cancer, 1 in 12 adults in the US get this news every year.  You work for a major company with good benefits and you get PTO for care visits, high quality insurance, and FMLA benefits from an insurance company that pays you partial income while you are completely incapacitated.  If you die you also have a term life plan provided by your employer.  If a bank loans this guy money the chances that he lives long enough and has the income to pay the loan back are pretty good.  \n\nIf they loan you money and you're a $60k a year sole prop doing physical labor with no disability or workman's comp insurance they are taking on several orders of magnitude more risk.  So much risk they would rather avoid lending to you at all.  They know you're one bad day away from never being able to pay them.  You may disagree but they don't care.  \n\nIt's unfair and life sucks.  Welcome to rugged individualism in a capitalist society.  Good luck out there.",

I think you have other issues that are causing you problems.\n\nThe main problem is you have no assets and your taxable income is basically nothing. You look like you’re in poverty based on your income and you think it’s unfair that they’re taking the numbers you give them showing them that you’re not making any money\n\nAnd then, after all these business deductions you then have the same deduction as everybody else has\n\nThey’re not penalizing for those other deductions \n\n\nTell me how much credit card debt you have \n\nI’m guessing that it’s your use of credit cards too. That makes them skeptical.\n\nI’m not even disagreeing that it’s a little more difficult when self-employed to get certain kind of financing \n\nBut come on man everybody that’s a realtor in the United States is self-employed some of them have a nice house because they make good money \n\nYou’re saying you make $70,000 a year but you only pay taxes on 20 \n\nI’m sorry that banks are giving you the financing you think you deserve, but I guess I don’t feel like my bank treats me like crap. I like the fact they give me a cookie every time I go through the drive-through. 🤣\n\nI don’t even make a ton of money, but I bought a house and I have two commercial properties \n\nMaybe talk with your banker and say what specifically in my tax returns bothers you and they’re probably gonna tell you that you don’t make that much money. They’re basing everything on your income which you admit is low because you really make 70 grand you say but you write off everything acting as a business expenses aren’t real And that when you write off $50,000 worth of stuff, they should actually pretend that’s not a business expense and actual income\n\nYou just don’t make that much money that’s the problem if your taxable income was 80 grand they’d be much more willing to give you a loan then if it’s 20 \n\nAnd even if it’s 20, they’ll try finding ways to loan you money because banks like loaning money, but there’s obviously other things causing them to be skeptical",

If it's a business loan, your banker *can* add back personal living expenses that you are running through the sole prop but you need to provide proof that you're doing so which probably isn't a great idea. Additionally, your CPA will probably have to process and sign some letter which states the same.\n\nThat said, best case scenario, only the big stuff gets added back so if you have 12 $100 transactions you're not going to find a banker who wants to collect all the necessary documentation to prove that you're running medical expenses through the business. \n\nIf it's a personal loan, many banks sell off their mortgages and (to a lesser extent) their car loans to other banks or investors. What this means to you is that your loan request is going to have to conform to some specific guidelines and the banker can't look the other way if it doesn't.",

      "selftext": "I reconnected with some old friends from elementary school on Facebook during the pandemic. I expected nostalgia and maybe catching up on where life had taken us. Instead, I stumbled into a strange pattern I didn’t see coming.\n\nWith the first couple of friends, we swapped life updates, and when I shared some good news about how things had turned out for me with my small online business, the conversations just… fizzled. They stopped replying, or in some cases blocked me completely. It felt weird because I wasn’t trying to brag, just telling them what I’d been up to.\n\nThat threw me off, so with the next people I found, I downplayed my life situation and kept things simple. Suddenly, the conversations flowed and we stayed in touch. In fact, some of the people who ghosted me originally became cool with me again after I told them I’d “exaggerated” my story the first time around.\n\nIt made me realize how unpredictable people’s reactions can be when you reconnect after years. I thought sharing positive news about business success would be encouraging, but in reality it sometimes made old friends uncomfortable. On the flip side, being more low-key has kept the door open.\n\nI guess the lesson I learned is that not everyone wants to hear about your successes, even if you’re just trying to share your story. Sometimes keeping it simple and focusing on old memories is the better way to reconnect. This kinda reminds me of how some lottery winners have stories of suddenly finding a few of their friends and family members to be resentful of them after winning.\n\n#Edit:\n\nI run a one man web design business where small mom and pop shops and blue collar businesses pay a small fee each month to manage their company websites. I don't see how any of these guys would've thought I was trying to pitch them an MLM when the conversation of what we do for a living came up.",

Do I just start small and learn as I go, or should I sit down and build out a full plan before I even try? I don’t have a ton of money set aside, but I do have a bit of savings and even some extra here and there from Stаke. It’s not life changing, but it’s enough to make me think I could at least test the waters instead of just sitting on the idea forever.  \nFor those of you who’ve already made the leap, how did you begin? Was it testing things out as a side hustle, or did you jump straight into it full-time? Looking back, do you think you started the “right” way, or did you just figure it out as you went?",

There is a lot of things that should be decided upon ahead of time for sure!\n\nAs for me, I started my LLC because I'm in a state where it's cheap to form and upkeep, so there was very little downside to it. I only make a couple thousand a year doing it so I keep a full time job. Could I possibly throw all my time and effort into it and grow it faster, absolutely. I also like to eat though, so the risk of not eating makes me hesitant to go all in.\n\nLuckily, part of my job is actually helping do business formations, so the research part on that side was easy for me.

But it starts with figuring out what you like, what you want to spend your time doing, and how quickly you can get to making a reasonable profit so you can stop your day job if that’s what you’re in. The freedom a business owner is very liberating. Don’t let the first “step” or the “how” slow you down. Just get rolling and figure it out along the way.

They are accelerating the fall so they can be the ones in power when it collapses with plenty of Fart Coin available in their personal coffers so they can buy up the pieces just like the Russian oligarchs did for state-owned companies after the fall of the Soviet Union.

And my customer base is US manufacturers, who are also doing surprisingly well.\n\n\n\nI'm an importer as a service. I import components for US manufacturers. All of it comes from China. They use those components in their US manufacturing facility to assemble into their finished good.\n\nMy business is up this year.\n\n  \nI can only speak for myself and what my clients are doing/ told me. Other's experiences are their own. \n\nAs of last week, to date, I had only had one order cancelled due to the tariffs. They decided to make it in-house. Which they were tooled up to do.\n\nThat particular good, the tariff is 98%. The economics of it, that's not 98% increase in cost. Tariffs were already 28% before all this. So though 70% is a big increase, not terrible when you look at the overall impact to the client. That +70% on EXW. Which means before tariff, freight, my markup. Then it's their COG. Which, the actual cost of goods portion of their cost, is relatively small.\n\nThen this week, they decided to order through me from China anyway. What they calculated was that their cost to make it in house, was about the same as importing it. So by importing it, he's got his employees working on developing new products. \n\nSo in the end, now haven't lost any business due to the tariff. I was able to absorb some of the extra, and they are absorbing some. So far, as far as I know, none of my clients have had to increase their cost to the consumer. Though again, that's clearly because of the structure of me targeting US manufacturers, and how the actual percent that affects everything being minor. For those who import finished goods to sell to the consumer, it must be brutal.\n\nBeyond that, the 98% is a rare occurrence for my stuff. Most of my stuff is between 50-60%. Which it was 25-30% before. So not a huge increase. And again, it's still on EXW vs COG. So I absorb it for the most part. Sure, lower margin for me. But i'm getting more orders than before because that's how my US manufacturer clients are choosing to reduce cost.\n\nSo I am gaining market share. I'm getting more business. So i'm doing better than ever.",

          "body": "This post comes up a lot. Here's my reply the last time I saw this:\n\n&gt; My background is that I am a senior freelance website architect and full-stack developer. I am a small business owner for over 15 years and I run my own operation. One area of my business is building brochure sites, landing pages, and simple homepages for small businesses. I also build custom solutions for WordPress, and full WordPress websites for small-to-medium size businesses.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If your choice is between Squarespace, Wix, and WordPress, I highly recommend you select WordPress. It is a highly performant blogging platform and content management system. The team who builds it has significant investment and they update it constantly.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Because it's updated so frequently, you do need to perform consistent maintenance and updates, but other than that, it's a stellar platform.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I recommend Wordfence, Contact Form 7, Flamingo, Relevanssi, hCaptcha for WordPress, and WP Super Cache. These plugins are my standard install, and they basically hit every major point you need to worry about. They all have free options available, and do not require paying. The paid options are worth it though. CF7 deserves more donations.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If you are on a strict budget, I would host directly with WordPress.com and choose a nice off-the-shelf theme. For reference, WordPress.org is the free, open source self-hosted version. Most recent themes support the block editor, and you should be good to go. If you're looking at Woocommerce, Storefront is an excellent theme.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I'm not super familiar with Squarespace, but I am intimately familiar with Wix. This past year I was tasked with an emergency job to revamp a Wix site for a client who wanted to host a charity event. It cost the client a significant amount of money; far more than would have been needed if we had gone with my recommendation of a custom WordPress theme and plugin set.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When small business clients come to me asking for consultation, I ask one question:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Do you need to update your website constantly, like posting articles, blogs, events, courses, etc., or do you really just need a brochure site? Most small businesses need a small brochure site, with about 1 hour of maintenance/updates per month.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If you really just need a brochure site, a capable website developer who offers what I offer, static landing pages, is going to be far more effective for your business than managing a content management system. Ask for on-page SEO, and the following integrations: Google Analytics, Search Console Integration, Facebook/Meta pixel, Microsoft Clarity, and a one-way contact form. Your #1 traffic source is going to be Google Business Profile/Maps Integration, so ask if they can consult with you on that too.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Invest in your online presence, but don't get taken for a ride. I would strongly recommend hiring a qualified website developer who you can work with intimately one-on-one, and doesn't pass you off to a random support team. I can't emphasize enough how frustrating working with Wix support was.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nrkd8t/what_is_the_best_website_builder_for_a_small/ngiqb34/",

It’s been growing steadily and now we’re at the stage where we need to start hiring more people.\n\nA couple of years after launching, he brought in a college kid (let’s call him “J”) as an intern to help with day to day operations. J’s been here for a while and does a lot for the business.\n\nFast forward, I eventually decided to join and help out too after I got laid off from my company. My dad has told me that his long term plan is for me to eventually become the CEO and take over ownership of the business. But apparently, J currently holds the title of “CEO” because my dad casually told him he could have it.\n\nI don’t think my dad realized how big of a deal that could become later, but it feels like it’s setting up potential conflict down the road (both between me and J, and between me and my dad)\n\nHas anyone dealt with something similar? How do I approach this now before it gets messy later?",

If I’m right your best move is to politely ask your dad how you can improve and be someone he can one day trust to run the business.",

It’s sad, but I promise you he doesn’t care how you take this other person in the business. You need to start viewing him as a boss instead of your dad in this regard. Separate the two universes.

Go start your own venture. Go do something on your own for a while and maybe come back to it. Show him you’re worth it by pursuing other opportunities first and then he’ll realize how important you are. The guy he hired is temporary. As parents age, he will eventually start thinking about handing off the business to you or selling to someone else. Again, he’s his own person making decisions (not your dad).\n\n3.

I don't. \n\nFor the most part what would be better is if the product and the consumption cycle simply didn't exist. I feel that way about storage products too i guess. I want less stuff. I don't want to store more stuff. As for christmas, i guess I also don't want any tyoe of storage for christmas whether its eco friendly or not. I think consumers feel a lot of pressure to buy stuff all the time and advertising is intense and they are tapped out. The tariffs are having negative worldwide effects on tons of industries and billions of people too. People have less to spend now in my opinion.\n\nI am in the kids toys industry (which may seem ironic given what I just wrote lol) and feel like eco friendly is pretty much a scam or juat greenwashing in this industry. There is nothing eco friendly about plastic from China (or anywhere else but shipping it from very far away just adds to the idiocy of our entire world economy) period. Money is the ultimate determinant of where things get made, not environmental concerns.  Sometimes things are made from wood from places like indonesia using tapped out rubber trees. I really don't think that's much better either. The human labor and the shipping alone. There are recycled plastic toys made in the USA but they are outrageously expensive and customers care more about their money than a toy made in the US from recycled materials.  Toys made from recycled plastic, esp stuffed animals are just putting tons of micro plastics out there, and the toy industry is really on a consumption based blind box craze atm which is largely fueled by Chinese brands. It's just gambling and getting people to buy more crud.",

Eco-friendly is a tiebreaker when price and quality are equal - it's rarely the primary driver. The exception is younger demographics (Gen Z especially) who will pay a small premium (5-10%) if you can tell a compelling story about the impact.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What actually sells:\\*\\* Durability and functionality trump eco-credentials every time. If your sustainable product also happens to be more durable or multifunctional, that's the angle to lead with. \"This storage bench will last 10 years\" sells better than \"This storage bench is eco-friendly.\"\n\n\n\n\\*\\*On Christmas storage being down:\\*\\* I think you're onto something. People are buying fewer, higher-quality decorations rather than seasonal clutter. The Marie Kondo effect is real - consumers are moving away from accumulating things that only get used once a year.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Multifunctional is the future:\\*\\* This is the trend with the most staying power. In my experience, people will pay 20-30% more for furniture that serves multiple purposes, especially in urban markets where space is expensive.\n\n\n\nYour English is great, by the way.

I made sure that I had a years worth of salary saved up in case things went bad and I also made sure that I had more than enough monthly income in case there would be fluctuations.\n\nThe things that made it easier for me to jump to leaving my full-time job were proof of financial success, proof that I had what it takes to do a business and financial security layered on top of that.\n\nUltimately, when I checked out my finances, I realized that I was losing money by not switching careers",

I hated it...I at first thought I'd be \"helping\" people, only to come to realize that instead I was buddying up to doctors to convince them to write a $300/mnth drug when their patient could get a $4 generic instead. Miserable.... and against everything I believe in... but it supported my family so I did it (shamefully and regrettably). About 7 years in I started a contracting business on the side. It was 5 years before I could take a paycheck, 7 years before I could give up my day job.... and I was terrified. However, 10 years later (now) I make way better money, have a business that will retire me someday (not too long down road), have employees that I take good care of (though that comes with a lot of frustration and lack of appreciation), and am in general FAR happier in life. I wouldn't change it. \n\nWhat I'd do differently.... \n\n1. I have a business partner, that may not have been best. I would have grown faster on my own and most partnerships fail (though we work well together).\n\n2. I'd have done it sooner.... I regret selling my soul. Today we operate a very ethical business and I feel good about what we do. I still wake up (no joke... I really do) with stress-mares (not really a nightmare, but darn close)... worrying that I didn't get something done and my boss is going to come down on me or that I'm being held responsible for the unethical stuff we did (no possible repercussion in real life...I just feel like there should be).\n\n3. I'd have saved enough nest-egg/safety net while in my corp job to carry me so I could have left the day job sooner without worrying about sinking the new business or my personal financial status. Being able to fully devote myself from the start would have sped the process greatly.\n\nI think starting your bakery on the side while working is good.... but try to transition fast if you're financially able. Also... maybe look for an existing bakery with employees you can purchase (could even be no money out of pocket with a low cost owner finance). If there are a couple employees who can carry a part of the load you can have immediate cash flow and work on improvements to service/quality/profitability while devoting your evenings and weekends. You'd be surprised how many small business owners are to the point of retiring or moving on, and it's hard to sell a lot of small sole proprietor type businesses, so it may not take a lot to get someone to give you a running start.\n\nGood luck! Work hard and make it happen... as long as you make the financials work, you'll never regret the move away from corporate.",

This will continue to happen given the current circumstances.\n\nAt this point you have two options: figure out how to run your organization with less experienced people who you will also eventually lose as they become more senior OR figure out how to make your business run on a remote model and keep the people you apparently value.\n\nEmployment is an agreement to swap time and skills for the means to make life easier and hopefully enjoyable.  Usually that means money but what you're discovering is that once you're making a certain amount that pays the bills and keeps you from worrying too much over finances, there are other things these people want that simply \"more money\" can't buy...and you're not willing to give them that while others are.\n\nYou've chosen to let senior talent walk because you won't give them what others will.  Choices have consequences.",

If you are a small business owner, it's likely that they take what you give them (knowledge, insight, business secrets) and think they can do the same thing.\n\nSometimes you can be too good to people, and today there are way more takers than givers. People watch these social media videos of becoming a millionaire in 24 hours, live your life on your own terms with your own company.\n\nBeing a good and nice business owner can sometimes backfire. People often don't respect that anymore. They want what you have; they don't do it to Google or Amazon because they don't necessarily care about their employees. Everyone is replaceable because they can easily get more people, whether here or overseas.\n\nI owned several businesses and had to deal with it myself until I got to a point that, sure, from an \"employee\" perspective, they want you to be a good boss, treat you well, give you work-life balance, and so on, but the thing is, you can offer all of that, eventually they want even more and more because they want what you have.\n\nLook at Starbucks; I remember when they were a reputable company, praised for paying decent wages with good benefits. Now, it's different. People strike to wear what they want and to oppose a dress code meant for the company's well-being. In the end, who loses? Many are now unemployed and complaining. Ultimately, does Starbucks really owe them anything, or have they just taken things too far for what they are?\n\nAs a business owner, you will always face these issues. It' nature's law. People respect those who treat them poorly more than those who want to be good to them",
