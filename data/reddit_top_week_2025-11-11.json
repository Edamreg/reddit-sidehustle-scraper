      "selftext": "Real talk, podcasting doesn’t get enough credit as a side hustle. Everyone’s chasing dropshipping or freelancing, but a simple niche podcast can actually stack up fast if you’re consistent.\n\nI started mine talking about random stuff I was already into, didn’t expect much, but it picked up once I started uploading to Spotify, YouTube, and a few other platforms. Between listener support, affiliate plugs, and platform monetization, it turned into a decent passive stream.\n\nIf you’ve got something to say (or even just a hobby you rant about with friends), record it. You don’t need crazy gear either (I even started recording using my crappy Blackshark gaming headphone and Spotify Creators hosting.) \n\nAnyway, I'm on my 3rd month of earning over $500 a month. Not enough to pay all the bills, but it does help w groceries and other random expenses\n\nEdit: Make sure to know that spending a bit on good rigs and equipments like reapers shures, is always bound to happen. Most importantly, you'll make the bank on your podcast hosting platform (in my case is Castos)",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone! I wanna share my success story: I run a small coffee shop in a college neighborhood and last Black Friday, instead of doing the usual one-day discount madness, I tried s a week-long “stamp card” promo. Each visit earned a stamp, and after five stamps, you’d get a limited Y2K-style mug and a free drink.\n\nThe idea was just to keep people coming back instead of rushing in for one deal. And it actually worked! The week’s sales were up about 40% compared to the year before, and we handed out around 200 mugs to regulars.\n\nHere’s where it gets funny: I totally underestimated how much people would love that mug. It was this simple lime-green thing with pixel fonts and a tiny. I ordered 250 from a local printer thinking I’d have leftovers for months. They were gone in four days.\n\nThen came the DMs. People started asking if they could buy the mug online students, locals who missed the promo, even a few who moved out of town. So in December, I put up the remaining 50 mugs for $18 each on our website, and they sold out overnight.\n\nThis spring, I did a second run of 300 mugs at $22 each then and soft-launched it on our coffee shop’s Instagram. I didn’t even push it that hard, just a few story posts and a reel showing the design process. That batch cleared in about three weeks, bringing in roughly $5.4k in sales and around $2.3k in profit after costs.\n\nNow it’s basically a mini side hustle. I’m planning to do limited drops every season. I don’t want to become a full merch brand, but it’s wild how one small promo reward turned into something that helps cover rent on slower months and I'm so so happy to have made it work, idk if i'd have been able to keep the coffee shop open without the exta boost\n\nSo yeah, mind blowing how a side hustle can actually work!",

If nothing else do a balance transfer to 0% interest rate cards and pay the minimum whilst you increase your cash flow. Look into public transport rather than uber, uber is for people with money, and you ain't one of them. If possible up skill yourself by passing a driving test, and either look for delivery places that can supply a car or by yourself a fucking dirt cheap banger that has maybe a years worth of life left and pick up a second job. Me personally I work 8-4pm get two hours in between and then do 6-9pm on my second job. It's manageable and gives me time to gym and eat dinner.

I’ve come across things like making short UGC videos for brands on Methods.app, small survey or feedback tasks, and even reselling, but I haven’t tried any of them yet.

It's really easy to get certified--just follow their instructions. It helps if you already have some sample videos you can post, but you could also grab something from around your house and make a quick video. My experience has been that you have to do gifted collabs or $5 jobs to get your ratings up before anyone will hire you for anything else. And for my $5 jobs, I've had to purchase the products up front ($48 and $40) and then get reimbursed at the end. Those were for makeup products I use and love, so I didn't mind buying them. \n\n**Insense**: There are a lot of gifted collabs on this app too, but you can also apply for any job on the site. I just did a gifted collab TikTok shop video for a face mask, and the company liked my video and has offered me two jobs at $150 per video. $150 isn't a ton, but I think I've made maybe $20 on TikTok Shop in the last month, so I'll take it lol.\n\n**Billo** is another I hear good things about, but haven't used yet. You have to upload an introduction video before it will let you see any of the available jobs and apply, and I haven't done that yet.\n\n**Kale** also looks interesting--you do \"missions\" for the brand, and the pay for those seems decent.\n\nYou might want to get a portfolio put together, because brands always seem to ask for it. I took a UCG for beginners course online that was really helpful, but all that info is probably out there for free too.",

You’re still building trust, learning marketing, pitching yourself, and understanding what brands want, it’s just that with UGC, you’re the product.\n\nDigital products, on the other hand, give you more leverage. You create or partner with something that solves a problem once and it can sell over and over without you having to trade time for money.  \nWhat’s worked best for me is the affiliate model. I promote high quality educational products that teach marketing, branding, content creation, even business growth. Every time someone buys through my recommendation, I earn a commission (mine averages around 350+. From my experience and seeing other creators who started this way, it was easier to now expand to ugc, the audience is there and trust.",

In the past 2 years I have only created about 4 new videos.  My videos are reference material for many people. One of my videos is the top Google search result if someone searches my topic.  That one video consistently performs well. I spent an hour on it using my iPhone to record it. Unscripted. Unrehearsed. No graphics. Self recorded and edited. I simply shared my personal knowledge and experience, that I laid out on a marker board.  People seem to like it a lot.  The hardest part was getting to 1,000 subs so I could monetize.",

Consistency &gt; motivation.\n4. Nobody cares at first — and that’s freeing.\n5. Writing at 3 AM still counts.\n6. Kids getting sick will wreck your schedule, but you still hit send.\n7. One reader &gt; none.\n8. The only growth hack is showing up daily.\n9. I overthink subject lines more than anything.\n10. People open *stories*, not “tips.”\n11. Personal beats perfect.\n12. 80% of what you write will suck — publish anyway.\n13. Editing is optional when you’re being honest.\n14. Replies &gt; stats.\n15. You can sell nothing and still build something valuable.\n16. Failure stories connect more than success stories.\n17. The best lines come when you’re tired and done pretending.\n18. Posting to 5 platforms a day is overrated.\n19. Writing forces clarity.\n20. “Keep going” is cliché — but it’s the only rule that works.\n21. One sentence can change someone’s day.\n22. Chaos produces good writing if you let it.\n23. Every platform feels dead until something hits.\n24. The dopamine from new subs fades quick.\n25. You’ll want to quit every week.\n26. Every post feels pointless until someone says it helped them.\n27. AI can fix grammar but never voice.\n28. You find your niche by writing, not by planning.\n29. Boring days still deserve words.\n30. I refresh my sub count way too often.\n31. Family keeps me grounded when I spiral about growth.\n32. I owe everything to the habit, not the ideas.\n33. Money doesn’t make writing easier.\n34. Selling without selling feels better.\n35. Focusing on one thing beats chasing ten.\n36. Repetition *is* marketing.\n37. You build trust just by showing up.\n38. People buy consistency, not hype.\n39. I still don’t know what I’m doing — and that’s fine.\n40. Micro-wins compound.\n41. You can have a bad day and still hit publish.\n42. The right reader always finds you.\n43. Writing = therapy in public.\n44. Momentum &gt; speed.\n45. Authentic &gt; viral.\n46. Every word is a rep.\n47. You only learn what works *after* pressing send.\n48. A small audience is a secret weapon.\n49. The only real goal: write again tomorrow.\n50. 50 days in — still just getting started.",

If you ever go to the doctor to get blood drawn or pee in a cup or need a Covid test, I’m the one who does the testing. \n\nBut I had to pay for the degree, and just one job wasn’t going to make that happen quickly. Then I found out just how many people in healthcare work on call or per diem at other hospitals or clinics. \n\nA lot of this is made possible because lots of healthcare schedules are pretty unorthodox too. It’s not unusual to run across people who work 3 12 hour shifts a week, 4 10 hour shifts a week, and my personal favorite, which I’m currently doing, is working 7 10 hour days in a row, then getting every other week off. I get paid for full time but basically only work half the year. And while it’s only an average of 35 hours a week, I get paid a 14% differential, so I’m basically being paid as though I’m working 80 hours. \n\nBecause I have every other week off, and because I live in an area with lots of hospitals, it was easy to find a second job in my same industry at a different hospital, doing basically the exact same thing. I’m “on call” so I’m the person who comes in if someone needs a vacation and they don’t have enough full time staff to cover, or if someone is out sick. They work around my FT job, and I can turn down shifts. \n\nBut for the past 3 years, I’ve worked every other week and picked up 2-3 days during my off weeks at my other job. It averages out to working about 10 days during a 14 day period, which is what most people do working 9-5 M-F. Granted, I work more hours in a day, and I work a lot of nights, weekends, and holidays, but I paid off my student loans in 2 years and maxed out my retirement contributions for the past 2 years. I’m only sorry I didn’t learn about this scheme sooner.",

          "body": "I will start by saying, 2 days ago my septic biofilter broke off and fell in septic tank. I called septic company and they said someone will be out in 2  hours. My doorbell rang and I opened the door... A 20 year old woman, blond hair, maybe 120 lbs, in pink rubber overalls, long eyelashes and I swear there was glitter. She looked like Barbie. She said, I am here to fix your septic. I looked in the driveway for someone else, assuming she was assisting. Nope, all I say was a white and pink pickup truck. I went back in the house. 1 hour later doorbell rings. She said all fixed, she rebuilt biofilter and tested all systems. I had to ask. I told her I was not expecting her when I was told someone was coming. She said instead of going to college like her friends she worked entry level at a septic company making $20 per hour. Now, 3 years later she makes $45 per hour and %20 of all repairs. Last year she made just shy of $140k. She said they cant find enough employees.. And she makes 3x the $ her college graduate friends make. I have experienced the same thing before with an 18 year old HVAC tech, who made $75 per hour. Not enough people. And a 24 year old electrician. How is it possible not to make 100k as a yound healthy adult?",

      "selftext": "Everybody's need for a side hustle is different. \n\nBy need, I mean literally how much you need in order to:\n\n1. Consider the side hustle worthy of building it\n2. Consider the side hustle worthy of maintaining it \n3. Consider the side hustle worthy of growing it\n\nSomeone who sells a $1 product but needs $1,000 a month in net profit, without a way to reliably get customers, will most likely give up before they ever reach their goal. \n\nThat's why you see so many \"\\[insert side hustle\\] is a scam!\" posts. They tend to be those looking for a \"plug and play\" solution when there aren't any outside maybe opening a franchise (and even then market conditions could change your approach). \n\nSo how do you escape that trap? Here's a simple three-step framework: \n\n1. Ask higher-quality questions. By \"higher-quality\", I mean specific, tailored to your situation, and requiring input that's deeper than what a base prompt ChatGPT reply can give you. \"What's the best side hustle...\" is bad. \"What's the best side hustle for college students\" is better. \"What's the best side hustle for college students in a pre-med curriculum I can start for under $100\" is good. \"What are side hustle ideas for college students in a pre-med curriculum I can start for under $100 and only requires 1-3 hours a week to maintain\" is golden. Why? Because the higher-quality the input you give, the higher-quality output you'll receive.  \n2. Once you have 3-5 ideas that seem feasible, get a better understanding of what you need and then pair that need with the side hustle ideas that reasonably can get you there in a realistic time frame. For example, if you need $1,000 a month and sell a product/service for $100, all you need is 10 customers and you've met it. Simple, right? \n3. Do your own research. Reverse engineer someone whose already making the kind of money you want to make. The internet makes this pretty easy to do, especially if that person is selling on a public-facing platform like Upwork, Fiverr, Etsy, or eBay - you can reasonably guesstimate all-time/monthly income based on the available metrics (and in some cases if you pony up for a month of a paid analytics tracker, you can dive even deeper into those details). From that information, you can create your own offer, model if after the winners, and then tweak it to better serve an audience that you would be part of if you'd found it first.  \n\nNow, here's the kicker: what if you do all three of these steps AND THEN ask a question based on what you've already done? You will likely get replies that are so well articulated, it'll feel like you're trying on a tailor-made suit for the first time - the answers will fit you, and only you, and you'll be able to get even more insight (while being able to easily spot those who have no real-world understanding of what you asked for, and then can brush them off). \n\nHope this helps.

I have my masters in I/O Psychology and a background in HR, but I feel like my skills outside of that are…nonexistent. \n\nSince I’m pregnant, I know it’s not super feasible for me to find a job right now and still be able to afford childcare with this current job market. Im still trying but coming up short. My husband can afford most of the bills on his income but it will be tight and I’m hoping to at least help with groceries and expenses for the baby. \n\nHere are a few things about me:\n- I have a creative spirit but not the best at design. I can sometimes make a good template but I have no idea how to create designs otherwise (willing to learn if this is viable)\n- I’ve tried fiverr but I just am not sure what to sell on there and I don’t have a create copy of my work\n- I’m still too inexperienced to be a consultant in such a saturated field. Though, I’d love to be and again, not sure how. I’ve even looked into this one.\n- uber and doordash aren’t options for me…mostly due to safety concerns and anxiety\n- I also have no idea how to make a following for affiliate marketing or to make money from social media. I’m not sure what my content would be and the thought of getting in front of a camera gives me the ick\n- I love to critique and judge things, lol. Not sure if there’s a side hustle for that.\n- I love teaching and giving advice, but I don’t know where to start there since I can’t find a job doing this \n- I’ve considered selling some hr related templates on etsy but the set up fee is holding me back \n- I like to read? Anything here?\n- really not sure I have any special talents tbh \n",

Stay in school, get a part time job (think McDonalds, grocery store clerk, etc.)   You could also help the elderly in your community by mowing their lawns and keeping their sidewalks free from snow in winter and charging a modest fee.\n\nPeople will say go make money on the internet, but that takes time. Nobody is discovered overnight.  You COULD teach language online - and do this in conjunction with \"physical work\" as I've referenced above, as well as school.  Between the three things, you'd be busy and making money.\n\nI suggest turning your language talents into a career by looking into translation services online, as well as maybe the United Nations.

If you have ER or ICU experience, or heck any type of nursing experience, cross train to PACU and take a few days of \"call\" on your days off.\n\n Being on call means that they can call you in at any time during your on call shift for emergency surgical cases.\n\n The thing is that you get paid for being on call, yes, even being at home. My facility pays $4/hr for being on call at home, and time and a half if you're called in with 2 hours pay guaranteed even if the case is cancelled a second after you clock in. Today just being on call on a Sunday I made $349 and only worked 1 real hour out of the 4 I was clocked in with a patient ratio of 1:1. ",

Not talking about paying for courses because I'm broke lol but like things where you can learn and maybe make a little money at the same time. Saw someone mention getting paid to complete surveys but that seems like pennies. Others talk about learning coding through freelance projects but that's way above my skill level right now. I'm specifically interested in learning about personal finance and investing since I literally know nothing about that stuff but I like it. Just seems like most educational content either costs too much money or youtube videos that put me to sleep. Does anything actually exist where you actually learn practical skills for free?

          "body": "Well it sounds like you need a manufacturer not supplier. I don't know what your product is but in most cases that manufacturer location is in China because of costs. Alibaba is still the best bet but you need to narrow your search to only manufacturers and they should be only in your niche category, in other words already making similar products. Choose the ones that are certified and have a good track record and history of being in business. 100% they will charge a fee to create a sample, nobody works for free. The other thing you have to be careful of is them stealing your idea/product and making it themselves so you need an NDA not that it would really work in a country like China but at least it will have them think twice about doing that. If you are really confident in your idea a patent protection is the best thing you can do and has the international. This is costly however. So yea, to sum it up coming out with a new product as a side hustle is no easy feat. Wishing you luck and hopefully I gave some advice that helps.",

      "selftext": "hey everyone, ive been lurking this sub and I feel like I should share my passive income story. I have no referral link or anything to shill, just purely wanting to share what worked for me.\n\nI defintiely did not grow up or have an affluent life. It was actually quite the opposite. However, I was fortunate enough to be able to live with my very kind and caring parents for the the first half of my college life. \n\nI worked at a grocery store and made minimum wage. However I managed to save $1,000 and by the advice of my friend, I put all of it into an ETF (which is a way to track an index, or basket of stocks) called “VOO”, which tracks the S&amp;P 500. Basically it’s the top 500 companies in the US is the benchmark for safe but risk appropriate investing. Basically, if it fails, you have bigger issues to worry about than money in your life.\n\nBasically, I saved $75 every week and would just have it automatically deposit and purchase more VOO. I started this around 2015/2016ish.\n\nFastforward 10 years later, and I officially crossed $100,000 in gains (I’ve been looking forward to this day for so long!!). I literally just started with $1,000 in VOO, and autoset $75 to deposit and purchase VOO every week with my very tiny wages, and I managed to cross the $100k mark at a relatively young age.\n\n  \nThis, I feel like, was true passive income as I genuinely forgot about it for months and it had almost no effect on my life. I genuinely completely forgot about it at points in time, and didn’t even know when the market was going down (or higher!). I would periodically just check maybe once a month. \n\nThe point of this post is definitely NOT to brag. in fact, there’s probably way more people doing better than me. But I just wanted to show everyone that there ARE easy ways to make passive income, even with a minimum wage like me!",

Needless to say, I failed at most of them, except blogging; I did make some money with it.\n\nThen finally, something clicked, and I started making consistent money. It all started when I purchased an eBook (can’t remember the title now) for $10; it was about creating and selling books on Amazon.\n\nI took action and created multiple books and published them via CreateSpace (now merged into KDP). I still remember the very first month I made $1.44 in book royalties. Then around $13 during the second month. Soon, I was making a couple of hundred bucks every single month.\n\nI still create and publish books on Amazon via KDP and make anywhere between $300 to $700 every month. I know it’s a very small amount, but it does help me and my family.\n\nThe other two side hustles that worked for me include Affiliate Marketing and Digital Product selling.\n\nSo, basically, I do these three things to make a decent monthly income.\n\nI would like to know what side hustles or passive/active income ideas you guys are focusing on and what’s working best for you.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nSubha",

          "body": "I have to say KDP was my first success, too. I started a few years ago but it got really crowded fast. Today there are a few sales here and there but nothing spectacular. But by being very consistent with publishing while niching down heavily you can still be somewhat successful. At my time it was actionable reports and guides for local service providers wanting to improve parts of their business. Everybody doing KDP should definetly go with their promo offerings and KDP Unlimited, expand to other platforms and utilize deal platforms for more exposure. If it's educational stuff, it always made sense to publish some sort of series that handles different parts and processes towards some goal. That stuff that can be combined into nice bundles that offer real value. Also people love unexpected freebies. Link inside your publications to video content, tools and printables that complement your content whenever you see fit. Give your readers something to implement/work on after consuming your stuff so that they benefit from your advice as fast as possible. Also ask for reviews, without reviews there are no sales, especially on Amazon. To get started give your publications away for free in exchange for reviews. That makes a huge difference. It's absolutely necessary to get some proof from real people. My last point: Spend time on your branding and establish as many touchpoints as possible. When someone wants to be educated by a brand, he should find a decent first page communicating that he's in the right place with you when googling your brand name. Good luck to everybody trying.

          "body": "For me a decent side hustle I've been doing is looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than any initial cost. It's a form of arbitrage, and it can make you an extra couple hundred each month. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives those offers higher, creating more opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how it works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

          "body": "Nice work sticking with KDP until the flywheel turned. Those $1.44 and $13 months break many people, yet you kept publishing. Since your best sellers are educational workbooks, I would treat this less like single titles and more like a structured learning path. Build clear series progression, bundle volumes, and include lightweight printables and short videos via links inside the books. Add a simple in‑book call to action to capture email and deliver a companion resource; reviews follow more easily when readers feel they got immediate, practical wins.\n\nThe niche is crowded, but consistency plus positioning still compounds. Aim for a distinct pedagogical angle and repeatable format, then price test across KDP Select promos while tracking KU reads versus sales. Repurpose content for adjacent channels like Etsy for printables and Gumroad for digital packs, and refresh cover design and branding so your catalog signals coherence. On the affiliate and digital product side, focus on offers that deepen the same audience outcome, not generic monetization.\n\nOne caution: lists of survey apps and crypto casinos tend to be noisy and low‑trust. Your time is better spent tightening a workbook‑to‑email‑to‑bundle funnel and measuring how many readers progress to your higher‑value sets. That is where defensibility lives.",

      "selftext": "Hey guys this surprised me but I wrote a short novel earlier this year and I had been working on for a few months, I published it through the kindle program and made a few posts on my Instagram and Facebook about it. \n\nFirst month in and it was a little disheartening because my only sales were 50% friends and family, so I just forgot about it after 2-3 months. However it surprised me because I ended up getting email notifications that I would have commission of $50 for a month, and then it slowly started ramping up to $80-$90ish, and now it’s running in the low to mid hundreds. This really surprised me but I kid you guys not I genuinely (almost) forgot about my novel and it’s now pulling me a few hundred a month completely “passive”. Like, I do zero promotion or any effort for it, but it’s somehow being recommended to people in the marketplace.\n\ncrazy how sometimes these things work out in the strangest ways, but that just shows that earning passive income isn’t always through an obvious path… \n\nhope this inspires anyone else. just thought I’d share lol ",

          "body": "A decent side hustle I've been doing that has worked this year is looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than any initial cost. It's a form of arbitrage, and it can make you an extra couple hundred each month. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives those offers higher, creating more opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how it works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

          "body": "OP is right to be wary. Most “side hustle” content optimizes for views, not outcomes. A few thoughts from building small products and testing arbitrage plays:\n\nBank and app bonuses can work, but they are seasonal and administrative. The bonusarb guide currently highlights SoFi Plus where you spend $10 and get $30 back, and a higher payout Chime offer that requires redirecting an employer direct deposit to earn around $390. These stack, but you need to track terms, KYC, payout timing, and tax implications. The aggregator they reference (Gemsloot) handles offer tracking and withdrawals; still, incentives change and dry up when the acquisition budget shifts.\n\nVideo editing is a better bet if you niche down. Short-form repurposing for local businesses or niche creators is not saturated when you anchor to outcomes: editing pipeline, caption templates, hooks per industry, and weekly analytics. Distribution matters more than craft alone.\n\nOffline, vending is capital intensive but can be defensible with the right placements. Expect a grind in securing locations and negotiating splits before it feels passive.\n\nIf you want “slow growth” with low cash, pick one skill with compounding leverage, aim for repeatable deliverables, and attach to an existing demand stream. Arbitrage is fine for quick wins. Durable income comes from owning a tight problem and a simple system to solve it.",

      "selftext": "Hey  , I've been lurking here for a while reading all your stories, and they inspired me to share mine. Like a lot of you, I have a full-time gig as a handyman – tools, nails, long days – and my girlfriend's hustling as a real estate agent. Bills add up quick, so we needed something extra without adding more grind.\n\nShe's a baking wizard: pastries, cakes, breads that make the whole place smell incredible (and pack on the pounds for me). We thought, why not flip that into cash? Signed up for Amazon Affiliates – free, approved fast. She started posting in Facebook cooking groups: simple recipes with everyday ingredients, plus shoutouts to tools she actually uses, like a solid mixer or heat-retaining pan. Affiliate links fit right in, totally natural, no spammy vibes.\n\nNow she's in 37 groups. To keep it efficient (her job's non-stop), she uses Facebook™ Groups Bulk Poster &amp; Scheduler | Auto Post. It's a Chrome extension – install it, connect your Facebook, select your groups, draft posts with pics or links, and schedule them to drop automatically. What it does: Handles bulk posting so no manual copy-paste drudgery, schedules ahead for consistency, avoids spam flags by posting natively, and even has analytics to track what's clicking. Benefits? Saves hours weekly, lets you focus on content over logistics, affordable (free trial, one-time buy I think), and keeps everything compliant with FB rules.\n\nI jumped in too – 21 handyman/DIY groups, sharing real tips on tools like versatile drills or long-lasting paints, with links woven in. We do 3 posts each per week, always prioritizing value so it's helpful, not salesy.\n\nThe payoff: Month 1 hit $1,100 net. Month 2 jumped to $1,950. Month 3's rolling strong. It's not overnight riches, but real extra dough from stuff we love, zero big upfront costs.\n\nWhat worked for us:\n\n* Niche down to what you know – authenticity shines.\n* Hunt for relevant FB groups (search \"your hobby + group\") and join a bunch.\n* Amazon Affiliates is newbie-friendly; start tracking clicks early.\n* A scheduler like this one scales it without extra sweat – just check platform rules.\n\nNot claiming it's fully passive yet (upfront setup took effort), but it's getting there. Anyone else crushing it with affiliates in groups?",

          "body": "Baking and handyman tips are concrete, and posting into relevant groups with useful content explains the early traction. The one place I would tighten is distribution risk and trust. Many groups either block links or quietly throttle anything that looks promotional, so your strategy benefits from a content-first flow: post the recipe or tool walkthrough natively, then invite readers to a short, non-commercial landing page that expands the guide and transparently discloses affiliate relationships. That tends to pass mod scrutiny and builds credibility.\n\nOperationally, treat this like a simple funnel: group post to educational landing page, optional email capture for “one new recipe or tool breakdown per week,” then affiliate links inside longer-form content. Use cohorts to test cadence and formats, for example imagery first vs step-by-step text, and rotate product placements rather than repeating the same mixer or drill. Track by group, not just total clicks, and watch for account health signals if you use schedulers. If a group bans links, keep the value in-post and move the CTA to “searchable title” plus brand page.\n\nKeep the posting helpful and native, move the actual selling to a transparent, well-structured hub, and let analytics guide which groups and content formats compound.",

      "selftext": "ok so i would say i was broke and bored, scrolling on my laptop, seeing all these “side hustle” ideas that never actually pay. then i remembered something i had been messing with, i had some content i made for fun, nothing fancy, just short clips, tips, and a few mini guides. i thought why not see if someone would actually pay for it\n\ni made a link, set a small price, and shared it in a few places where people might care. i did not expect anything. i literally thought maybe one person would check it out, maybe not even buy\n\nthen a few hours later, first payment. i was shocked. then another. then a few more that day. it is not life changing money, but it felt really good seeing 5, 10, 15 dollars come in from stuff i already made\n\ni realized a few things fast, people will pay for things that actually help them or are fun, even if it is small. you do not need thousands of followers, just put it where the right people are and make it easy to access. consistency matters. one post blew up, another one did not do much. keep testing, keep posting, learn what sticks\n\nnow i make a few hundred a week just from sharing links to stuff i already had. sometimes 20 dollars a day, sometimes 100 if a post gets traction. it is not insane, but it is real, and all from my laptop\n\nthe biggest lesson, people do not care about fancy setups. they care about value and if it feels real. do not overthink it, just share stuff you enjoy making and see what happens\n\nif you are broke or tired of all the “make money online” fluff, just try small things that actually work. you do not need a website, huge following, or fancy equipment, just something people will actually want, and a link they can click",

Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

Join programs like Amazon Associates or FlexOffers and start promoting products you'd recommend.  You can promote via social media or using your own blog/website. Check out YouTube for free tutorials on how to go about it. \n\nSupplement that with micro tasks, focus groups, and get-paid-to sites. You can do this in your spare time since the earnings are usually small. I personally do this and make about $200-300 a month.

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training glfrom beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free! At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

I’ve tried almost everything: selling digital products, joining online earning sites, designing things, even affiliate marketing… but nothing has worked so far.\n\nSometimes I feel really frustrated, like maybe I’ll never find a way that actually works for my age and resources. But on the other hand, I know failing is part of learning and eventually finding success.\n\nIs anyone else in the same situation? Or does anyone have real advice for a young person like me trying to earn money online? Any idea, even a small one, would be super appreciated!",

          "body": "You can try bonus arbitrage, which can probably make you a couple hundred each month. Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

Affiliate marketing can work when you actually have content what people like to read or watch. So, you need to improve your skills there and think about the audience again. Personally, I would avoid any clicking jobs, surveys and such, since you are not learning anything and they are very boring and routine. Also, most of them are scams.",

Try gig work and don't go for weird online stuff most of it is a trap and many steal information. \nBut 16 is the perfect age to do the following jobs that will also be useful long-term and can easily help build skills:\n1) Caretaking- so babysitting, nanny work, lawn care or weed removal, pet-sitting \nEasy to start up and word of mouth finds clients faster than paying for websites and so on. Once one neighbor knows and you do a good job they will definitely tell others. You can also make really good money because caretakers in most places don't make less than $20 an hour depending on services \n\n2) Lifeguarding or camp counselor - you are old enough that almost any YMCA will take you and you could get paid and trained in things like CPR and first aid. Most places help pay for the certifications, if not sometimes family members don't mind helping pay for the certifications if it means a good job and someone in the house knowing emergency care\n\n3)Thrifting resale. Tons of people do it and if you study up or have a knack for fashion or a closet to clear out. Ask family and friends if anyone needs help with garage sales or putting up decorations. Find a need and fill it for a price. \n\n4) nothing gets you rich quick without a consequence in this world. You have to invest time and effort. Just keep trying to find what works for you!

At 16, you’re not in a position to “get money for free” as passive income always seems to suggest. The only way that passive income works, if it’s not scamming other people, is if the thing you’re selling is providing a huge longterm benefit. Such a thing usually requires large investments, years of work, etc. If you could have that at 16, everybody would do it and the value would quickly diminish.\n\nAlso, imo if you get a regular brain dead job and just save that money to invest it in financial products, you’ll be way better off than trying any sort of business. Especially at your age, all investors will tell you: the biggest and safest factor is time, they all wish they’d started saving earlier.",

That's not enough time to try even one way for long enough (as in, to get good enough at it).\n\nWhat you are experiencing is the valuable lesson of failure, one that every entrepreneur will have to face in their life. It comes with the even more valuable lesson of dealing with frustration and anxiety, two key skills in business.\n\nMy pieces of advice are: focus on one thing and go all in; connect with people that know how to do that thing better than you do and learn as much as you can from them; partner up with people whose skills compliment your own.\n\nFor instance, I'm a tax lawyer. I learned my core skill through 10 years of service in big law. After I left, I partnered up with another lawyer that is very good at tax litigation, an auditor and a CPA to be able to deliver the complete service. We have another partner whose focus is strictly corporate sales and a consultant for business intelligence and AI. We're looking for a specialist in digital marketing right now, since our strategy is in need of a digital marketplace wiz.\n\nGoing at business alone, with no/low capital and no skills is the recipe for failure on top of which \"get rich scheme\" internet bozos thrive of.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been working online for over 10 years, and during this time, I’ve noticed a clear pattern among people who never make any real money — it almost always comes down to their mindset.\n\nHere are 7 types of people who almost never make money online (and why):\n\n# ‍1. The Information Collectors\n\nThey love learning, but never apply anything. They watch every YouTube video, download every freebie, and maybe even buy a few courses — but never actually finish or implement them.\n\n**The Problem:** They confuse learning with doing.\n\n**Fix:** Pick *one* business model and take consistent action on it for 90 days — no switching.\n\n# 2. The Shiny Object Chasers\n\nThey jump from one idea to another. One week it’s Amazon KDP, next week it’s affiliate marketing, then dropshipping, then AI prompts…\n\n**The Problem:** They’re always chasing what looks easiest or newest.\n\n**Fix:** Commit to *one* model until you’re profitable. Every business works — if *you* work it.\n\n# 3. The “No-Time” Excusers\n\nThey always say, “I don’t have time.” Yet they spend hours scrolling social media or binge-watching Netflix.\n\n**The Problem:** They underestimate what they can do in 1 focused hour per day.\n\n**Fix:** Schedule non-negotiable work blocks. Even 45 minutes daily compounds massively over a year.\n\n# 4. The Freebie Hunters\n\nThey refuse to invest a dollar. They want to build a business using only free tools and free info.\n\n**The Problem:** When you get something for free, you don’t value it.\n\n**Fix:** Be willing to invest — in tools, learning, and systems that save time or accelerate results.\n\n# 5. The Fearful Perfectionists\n\nThey wait for everything to be perfect before launching. Whether it’s a blog, product, or YouTube channel — they keep editing, tweaking, and never publishing.\n\n**The Problem:** Perfectionism is procrastination in disguise.\n\n**Fix:** Launch messy. Improve as you go. The market teaches faster than theory.\n\n# 6. The Overthinkers\n\nThey analyze everything to death. They spend weeks deciding on a niche or a logo instead of creating something.\n\n**The Problem:** They’re paralyzed by too many “what ifs.”\n\n**Fix:** Make quick decision, and take small actions. You can’t steer a parked car — start moving and refine as you go.\n\n# 7. The Instant Gratification Seekers\n\nThey expect quick money. If they don’t see results in 2 weeks, they quit and call it a scam. \n\n**The Problem:** They treat online business like a lottery, not a long-term skill.\n\n**Fix:** Think in *years*, not weeks. The internet rewards those who stick around long enough to learn what works.\n\nHave you ever caught yourself stuck in one of these traps?",

Or if your digital project develops and it becomes to integrate extensions or modules, but you did not natively think of it to work with modules you find yourself in complications: changing the heart of your system is unthinkable without a significant investment; generally the pseudo solutions found end up harming the user experience (the first and biggest example that comes to mind is dear Windoys which has only added layer upon layer of updates, each of which weighs down the OS and which comes with its share of flaws and finally security patches).\n\nMost of the people involved don't do it because their main concern is making money, when it should be delivering a quality service/product.\nAnd fortunately, not all solution creators are driven by their lack of money.\n\nSo I would say that we have to find a happy medium, the points you put forward are fair but we should not completely reject them.\nSomeone who has not done enough research, who is not a perfectionist, will perhaps have customers interested in the problem he promises to solve but will end up disappointed by the lack of quality.",

      "selftext": "A couple of years ago, I kind of stumbled into something I didn’t plan at all. I just wanted a small side project to do outside of work, and nothing serious, just a creative outlet. Instagram was honestly the last place I thought I’d make money.\n\n\n\nIt started super random. I had this tiny hobby account where I posted aesthetic desk setups and productivity stuff I found online. One post blew up out of nowhere, and followers started rolling in. Then someone DMed me asking if I could post their product on my story and offered $20. That was my “wait… people actually pay for this??” moment.\n\n\n\nI got curious and made a few more accounts in different niches, like quotes, lifestyle, cozy home decor, that kind of stuff. Nothing huge, but I started noticing patterns: which content got engagement, what time posts hit best, and what types of followers brands were after.\n\n\n\nEventually, I teamed up with two friends to handle more pages. I thought it'd make things easier, but managing 20+ accounts quickly turned into chaos: constant logins/logouts, getting flagged as bots, and even losing accounts because Instagram thought we were sketchy. On top of that, I started worrying about losing control over these accounts, since we were sharing passwords, any single leak could put all my accounts and earnings at risk. So I needed a way to keep full control over my own accounts without compromising teamwork.\n\n\n\nThat's when I got smarter about the setup. My friends and I used Canva for posts (none of us were Photoshop pros), Later for scheduling, CapCut and InShot for Reels, and AdsPower to keep everything separated. It helped a lot with security, no more device confusion or accidental cross-logins, and the teamwork feature let me assign roles and permissions without having to share logins directly.\n\n\n\nI wouldn’t call it “passive” in the beginning cuz it was a grind. But once things were set up, a lot started running on autopilot. Some of our old pages still bring in cash from story promos, affiliate links, or the occasional account sale to someone who wants a head start.\n\n\n\nHere’s what I’ve learned:\n\n• “Soft” niches (quotes, lifestyle, cute pets, productivity) are way easier to grow and monetize than most people think.\n\n• Consistency &gt; creativity when you’re starting out.\n\n• And seriously, once you scale, security and organization are everything.\n\n\n\nIt’s not a get-rich-quick thing, but it’s been a solid little side income for something that started as me just posting random aesthetic pics in my free time.",

It never was.\n\nMost of those “make money while you sleep” stories are just people trying to sell you something.\n\nWhen I was close to giving up, I changed my approach. I stopped chasing big results and started a tiny project with a tiny budget. Just me, some creativity, and whatever time I had after work. I made a few posts, created some visuals using basic editing tools, and built a simple online shop using Genstore. Growth was slow, but real. People visited. A few actually bought something. That was the first time I felt like my time and effort turned into something.\n\nThere were still problems. Lots of visitors, not a lot of purchases. I adjusted prices, rewrote product descriptions, improved images, and tried different platforms. It took a few rounds to get things right. Time was also limited since I had a full-time job. Nights and weekends were all I had, and burnout hit me more than once. The costs added up too. Tools, ads, subscriptions, product handling. Small stuff stacks up.\n\nHere’s what I learned:\n\n1.Focus on a very specific audience. Trying to appeal to everyone never works.\n\n2.Do your most important work when your energy is at its best.\n\n3.Treat spending like testing. If something fails, learn and move on.\n\nThis way isn’t fast. But it works. And it feels way more real than all the “get rich quick” noise out there.\n\nIf you're trying something on the side, I’d love to hear how it's going for you.",

      "selftext": "Super simple and straightforward way you can make some extra money from your phone. Basically a couple of my buddies and I resell used cars we buy them fix them up sell them. One of our biggest limiting factors is finding good enough cars in our area what I’m offering is for anyone Who can help find me used cars that I end up buying I will send you $100 just straight up that’s it. We buy between six and 10 cars a week so if you’re finding good opportunities, you can make some good money how it will work as I’m making a discord server where all specify what type of cars we buy And you just send them to me if we end up buying it I pay you that easy. As long as you have access to Facebook marketplace or used car marketplace platform you can do it. Lmk if interested.",

Especially since I'm studying something irrelevant to what I actually want to do.\n\nA few months ago I started doing remote work for a small startup (Vidcoin - www. vidcoin .ai), they pay people to record short audio or video clips that help train AI models. On a good month I can earn 2k, usually about 30/hr depending on the project and if I put my mind to it.\n\nIt started as a small side gig, but it made me realize I actually can make decent money online. Now I can’t stop thinking about whether I could turn this into something full-time or move into other kinds of online work like e-commerce, freelancing, or anything else that’s flexible.\n\nI’m not trying to chase easy money, I just feel like I’d learn more building things and experimenting than sitting through lectures that don’t connect to anything. Also, the corporate world sounds horrible for me and my mental health.\n\nFor anyone who’s dropped out, freelances full-time, or runs something online:\n\nHow did you figure out what to focus on? Did you wait until you were making enough to drop out, or just go for it?\n\nNot trying to promote anything here, just trying to figure out my next move. Appreciate any advice from people who’ve been through something similar.",

          "body": "I recently starting working as a court transcriptionist, which is fully remote. I am technically still in training, which lasts a month or two (depends on how fast you are). \n\nI am sent court audio files, and I am supposed to transcribe them into a specific format, which can take a bit of time. It pays $2 per page, each page usually has between 200-300 words on it, and so how much you get paid depends on how fast you can type. If the audio file is clear, I can do some pages in one minute, but if the audio is hard to hear and I have to go back and listen over and over, it can take several minutes. And then you have to go back and proof read and make sure the formatting is right, which adds to the time. \n\nIt's obviously better if you can type fast, I'm only at 65 wpm (slow for this kind of work), but there's room to grow and get better. I bought a foot pedal to pause audio, which also helps with speed. It was $70, but definitely worth it! I bought two other cheaper ones that didn't work with the audio software. Other than that, I have not paid anything for this job, not the classes or training. \n\nOverall, I am liking it. It is fully remote, I'm even allowed to travel, and I don't have to \"work\" with anyone except over email or zoom for instructions/ classes. There are no benefits like healthcare, it's contractor work (1099), and you have to pay your own taxes, but you also get to set your own schedule. As long as you submit the transcript before it's due, you're free to work as much or little as you want. \n\nAnother downside to consider, you are listening to court cases that contain sensitive information and details of crimes. Not for everyone, and can be difficult to listen to sometimes. \n\nI'm only a month into training, so still new. Hopefully it works out. I was also doing freelance transcription work, which is remote and doesnt cost anything to start. It pays a lot less, but it's also less strict, and a lot of the audios are short and easy.",

I'm supposed to have a virtual orientation tomorrow on Nov 7th. My first day is supposed to be Wednesday the 12th. Training is onsite, but afterwards I'll work from home except for twice a month. It doesn't quite feel real, but I did my fingerprints, drug testing, and background, hr paperwork etc..\n\nUpdate: I just finished my orientation and it IS a real job ladies and gentlemen! I start Wednesday. Orientation was virtual and I was in a group of 4 other people. A recruiter working for Randstad Staffing reached out to me via Indeed on 8.10.25. originally I was not selected for the class, after 1 interview with m the recruiter and the company and the recruiter reached out with the denial and told me if I was available he would try to get me in the next one. I received a call about a week later asking if I was still interested. I scheduled a second interview with the hiring manager and I thought it went well, but it was a full week before I heard anything about the job directly. While waiting for that, I completed my background check, and then scheduled my drug test and fingerprinting. Those things were completed before I received confirmation that I was accepted into the class from my recruiter. The date on my testing was 10.7.25. They gave me a possible class date of November back in one of my initial interviews. I'll be working for Wells Fargo on a 1 year contract in Tier 2 Escalation and Case Management. They said expect 10-12 calls and to manage 30-50 new cases a day, so I'm expecting a heavy workload, but not necessarily heavy phone time. I'm okay with phone time, but Wells Fargo is providing all equipment including the computer and Internet some of which I have to bring back and forth when WFH or WIO.  I'll be making 25.50 an hour with full time hours and the option for overtime. It's been a two month process.",

This gives you your 6 hours of work, with the unpaid lunch break.\n\n As for the 15s, I know different states have different rules, depending on the hours worked. In MA, you get one paid 15 if you work 4 hours, a paid 15 and an unpaid 30 at 6 hours and two paid 15s and an unpaid 30 at 8 hours.  \n\nYou'd probably have to check with HR about how those get scheduled.\n\nBest of luck!  😁",

      "selftext": "I was focused exclusively on SEO for my finance blog. Google traffic was my only goal.\n\nFriend who runs a successful blog kept telling me to try Pinterest. I brushed it off because Pinterest seemed like a platform for recipes and home decor, not finance content.\n\nAfter 8 months my blog was still under 500 monthly visitors from Google. SEO is slow and competitive in finance niche.\n\nFinally tried Pinterest out of desperation. Created 20 pins, joined some Communities via Tailwind, posted consistently for 30 days.\n\nMonth 1 results:\n\n- 1,847 visitors from Pinterest\n- 89 email subscribers\n- 2 affiliate commissions\n\nPinterest traffic in one month exceeded 8 months of SEO traffic. I wasted 8 months ignoring my friend's advice because of assumptions about what Pinterest was for.\n\nNow at month 6:\n\n- 8.2K monthly Pinterest visitors\n- 450 email subscribers total\n- $340 monthly affiliate income\n\nPinterest is my main traffic source now. Google brings maybe 600 visitors monthly while Pinterest brings 8K+.\n\nThe lesson: Don't dismiss platforms based on stereotypes. Test them and see actual results.\n\nWish I'd started Pinterest when my friend first suggested it. Would be 6 months ahead now.\n\nWhat advice did you ignore that you later regretted? Always curious about other people's learning moments.",

      "selftext": "The idea came from someone that runs a disney holidays comparison platform. She makes about 3k a month from the website while working about 3-4 hours a month on it. Most of her traffic comes from SEO. The revenue model is mainly affiliate commissions.\n\nI heard about her succesfull project and thought well I can do that as well. I'll let AI do the website coding (no wordpress or CMS) and the content writing (using markdown format).\n\nThere are javascript libaries that allow you to load markdown as SEO optimized content on a web project. Lots of frontend developers have blogs that use this structure. Yet this structure is barely used in the affiliate marketing/SEO world.\n\nOf course I couldnt just copy her niche, that wouldnt be fair so I came up with a similiair yet different niche. A theme park the size of a disney theme park but a little less known.\n\nSomething to point out here is that her (and my) platform are not in English. This makes it a lot easier to rank due to less competition and lower content saturation in that language market.\n\n# Building the website\n\nMy first step was to create a rock-solid plan. I spent a few hours outlining a detailed, phased plan for the entire project. This document detailed the exact frontend folder structure, the required reusable components like headers and footers. (all done with the help of my friend Google Gemini). next step was to split the plan in different phases and let my AI assistants complete the development for each phase.\n\n# Content writing\n\nWhile the coding AI was churning out pages, I put another AI to work on the content. I gave it the topics and keywords, and it wrote all the descriptions for the accommodations close to the theme park, the SEO texts for the pages, and several blog posts, all formatted in Markdown. This content is loaded directly into the website (using mdx), no CMS needed.\n\nFrom the initial idea to a fully functional, content-rich website deployed on Vercel for free, the entire process took just under two weeks.\n\nI'm currently letting Google index my project and have more content to be published in my pipeline. Will give an update in a few months.\n\n ",

He tells an anecdote about how all same three companies were allowed to bid.

One major part of most philosophy degrees is logic, and science is actually better than engineering if you want to understand things. I picked up coding, networking, database, and security skills by just working on projects, building things, and training. I worked as a senior software engineer in the Bay Area and DC/Northern Virginia. I've worked with some Palantir customers and  employees.\nI'm not saying the govy game isn't a lot of political word soup and name dropping. It's all about who you know and \"assisting\" in writing requirements so that your company will win contracts. I wonder if Palantir (or any other contractor) could survive without that giant gov teat in their mouths.\nEven so, I have personally built real products that are actually used and actually do what was promised in the public and private sectors -- not hand-wavy vaporware. In my limited experience, there are a lot of non traditional technical people like me who are the bosses of \"real engineers\". As Teddy Roosevelt said, the secret to success is being able to work with people, and in my experience, self-proclaimed \"real engineers\" are not exactly easy to work with. So, a philosophy degree that teaches you how to reason, read dense material, and write/present ideas is valuable. That's probably why philosophy has been the top undergrad degree for lawyers. People who know how to think and present information can pick up a myriad of technical details and be immediately useful across any organization.",

      "selftext": "I run a small design business here in Texas, nothing crazy but it’s finally doing well after a few rough years. The weird part is, the more it grows, the more I’ve started thinking about how tied up my personal life is with all of it.   \nI’ve seen friends lose half their business after a divorce, and it honestly freaked me out a bit. It’s not even about trust it’s just realizing how fast something you built from scratch can get tangled up in stuff that has nothing to do with work.   \nI’m in a serious relationship now and things are good, but for the first time, I’ve actually caught myself thinking about stuff like prenups or protecting ownership. Never thought I’d be that person, but here we are.\n\nAny other business owners hit that point where you start looking at marriage a little differently once there’s a company involved?",

The only question is whether you want the prenup that you and your partner agreed to, or you want the prenup that the government writes and can change at any time without any notice or notification. \n\nFor those founders who have a great relationship, that is wonderful, but how about you write into a prenup or even a postnup exactly how many shares in your company your partner gets? Lay it out there. Put it in writing. If you want to give them 50% of your company, that is absolutely wonderful. Put it into a post-nuptial that they get 50% of your company if something goes wrong in your relationship. \n\nCouched the right way, this can be seen as a pledge to your partner rather than an attempt to keep assets away from your partner. \n\nIt's making sure that if something goes wrong in your personal relationship, the marginal cost of attorneys will be limited to the cost of a prenup rather than the exorbitant cost of divorce attorneys spread over, potentially, years.",

They're not starting with nothing.  Those roots have value.  More so if they're getting married at age 30.  The career push is starting, but the good position was a generational effort and a 20+ year foundation.   \n  \nIn no other business arrangement would you commit yourself to payment obligations for life if the other partner can withdraw all support.   In no other field would you fail to consult an expert.  (If your tooth hurts, see a dentist.  If you need legal work, talk to an attorney.)  \n\nReligion isn't an excuse either.

They outline the finer details you may have glossed over. Everyone just thinks their loved one will be “fair”. But stating it is just so vague. What’s fair to you and your loved one?

Prenups, business contracts, etc. Idc what my brother, sister or wife says about they can’t trust. I can’t trust them if they can’t discuss details of what’s fair.\n\nPlus, contracts hold through time.

          "body": "When we talk about Tesla's value, we're talking about their market capitalization - \"market cap\" for short. Market cap is the price of an individual share of the company multiplied by the number of shares owned and traded by shareholders - these shares are also call \"outstanding shares\". \n\nSo, market cap = share price x outstanding shares. \n\nAs I type this, Tesla's share price is $428.79 and they have 3.33 *billion* outstanding shares, making their market cap roughly $1.428 *trillion*.\n\nOver the next decade, Musk has been tasked by the board to lead Tesla to hit certain goals. As he reaches each of these goals, he unlocks a portion of his compensation which is a mix of cash and equity (aka shares of Tesla). If  Tesla hits a certain number of goals by year 5, he'll receive the compensation amounts tied to those goals at the 7.5 year mark. If he hits all the other goals in time, he'll receive the rest of his compensation at the ten year mark provided he hasn't left the company.\n\nAmong his goals is increasing the Tesla share price so that the company's market cap exceeds $8 trillion - an almost 6x increase from today. Most of his compensation will be in equity and will increase his ownership in the company to (I believe) 29% - about double what he owns now. So in 2035, his assets may be worth over $2 trillion.",

I'm not saying this is right or wrong, just highlighting that we're already past any notion of this being simply about growing the company's assets.\n\nTesla are also facing significantly more competition than ever before - they've lost a lot of their 'edge' simply to the fact that many other EV manufacturers are now into their own second and third generation models, and most of the innovation that drove early Tesla popularity is starting to look a little dated. Again, this isn't a negative or positive comment on Tesla, just to point out that it's not simply a case of business as usual for them.\n\nMusk will have to really drive the company forward exponentially, and make the move into wider battery-related consumer products, where they still have a competitive advantage, to even get close to this valuation.\n\nSo, if they manage that new valuation, and regardless of anyone's personal opinions on Musk, he will undoubtedly be a major part of that growth, even though it's a truly disgusting amount of money, he'll have earned it.",

One of the questions I have regarding pay packages such as this one is I wonder if Elon will be paid his bonus regardless of whether or not he in fact hits his sales targets. It's my understanding that bonuses like this are typically paid despite whether someone hits targets or not out of professional courtesy. Can someone with more experience clarify this?\n\nObviously it depends on the size and complexity of the deal. A $1,000 Christmas bonus gets paid out way more consistently than something like this, but how are professional courtesy deals for bonuses handed out at the extreme levels like the CEO pay package deal of a big firm like Tesla or even smaller (like mid cap or small cap or microcap)",

Failing is one thing, but giving up is shameful. I tried 5 different entrepreneurial ideas before 1 actually landed. I spent 10s of thousands of dollars, found out who my real friends were and sacrificed my \"Fridays with the boys.\" I would be happy to do it all over again because the one idea I had that landed paid me back 10x long term and has given me more time with my family than I could have ever dreamed of. It's similar to the military in a way. If you sign up and they tell you to do 100 push ups, you do 100 push ups regardless of how long it takes. You could sit there and do 1 every 60 seconds. You could do 2 every 20 minutes. You are not leaving until 100 have been completed because that was the goal. If your goal is to be an entrepreneur, then you will be an entrepreneur. There will be no excuses because your mind won't be able to comprehend it. It's ok to be nervous, it's not ok to never start. If you think it's not for you, then it probably isn't. Have you ever heard a professional athlete say in an interview that they didn't think the sport was for them? No, the first thing they say is they are going to win the championship. If they don't win the championship, they say there's always next year. The goal of an entrepreneur isn't to be the guy in a suit, a $2M mansion, and 6 cars in the garage. If that's why you are doing it, then you will never succeed. The goal of an entrepreneur is to solve people's problems.",

You are the one that needs to make that final call, decision etc. Nobody is there to help you.\n\nPeople get jealous - for this reason, keep everything very private. Especially revenue numbers. Most people just don't understand revenue / gp / np. They look at revenue only and have no idea.\n\nFriends and family etc are not really supporting you. They will be very skeptical. They will be expecting you to fail. They often will not act in a way that will help you.\n\nYou only truly fail when you quit. I have seen so many small business owners start and do ok, but don't have what it takes to keep going when it is a pure grind. It gets boring, very uncomfortable and not worth it. Until you get to a point where you are at a comfortable revenue / gp level that makes sense. You have to be in it for the long haul. For most this is 5+ years.\n\n Many people you deal with are not compatible with you or your company. This goes for customers, staff, friends / family and quite often other businesses. It's fine, don't take anything personally and just move on. Only deal with people that are good, isolate yourself from anyone else however hard that is.\n\nWhen and if you are successful, keep it to yourself. It's nobody's business but your own. The less people you tell, the better your life will be. Most people don't understand money and taxes, especially at a higher level. So if you make a million dollars for example, they would think you are rich. In reality you would need to give away so much of that money to take it, that it is not worth it. Especially when considering the missed opportunities you have when the government takes half of it.\n\nYou are always better off being honest and ethical. People and businesses that do not take this very seriously do not last.",

My boos, let's call him \"visionary man\", is all sales and big promises. I'm the one who built the whole stack: Rust/Node APIs, Tauri/React desktop apps, manages all the servers, load balancing, database. I literally build all the engine for all high-stake client projects.\n\nThe amount of work done is huge, the pressure is constant, but the pay is nonexistent. For months, our Whatsapp chat has been a broken record: me begging for my weekly pay, and him giving the excuses: \"I'm at zero\", \"waiting for money to come in,\" or just to busy flying around. To keep me motivated, he only keeps talking up about the future, how we'll \"get rich\" later with his next big project ,and that I just need to be patient.\n\nThe whole thing blew up recently. He's obsessed with this personal project, and when it slowed down because I was actually focusing on my school and personal stuff, he went off on me. He accused me of not being dedicated, compared me to his own insane workload. He then threatened my financial stake: he warned that if he has to invest more of his own money to keep his pet project moving, **the whole percentage picture changes.**\n\nThis is the bottom line: I built the business assets, but he treat my labor like free capital, and now he's threatening my future.\n\nI need some advice of what decision should take, i don't have any experience with this things. What would an experienced entrepreneur do?\n\nI'd be happy to answer any questions and provide more information about the situation, without revealing any personal details about the project or the company.\n\nSorry for my bad english, it's not my native language.\n\n\\[IMPORTANT EDIT\\]\n\nThank you for all the advice you've given me in this post. I think there were many details I didn't mention because I assumed they were obvious (obviously my mistake).\n\n* I'm 16 years old\n* I live in Venezuela\n* I never signed a contract to work for this person\n* I don't have legal permission to work\n* My boss has government connections, so it's unlikely I'd win in a legal battle.",

At 17, you’ve already built a whole platform, written the code, designed the architecture - something that grown-up companies spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on. That is your intellectual property.\n\nNow let’s get to the point. You’ve made a common mistake of many young guys - you trusted words instead of putting things on paper. Business is not about “trusting someone’s word,” business is about agreements that are legally documented.\n\nWhen there is no contract, no share agreement, no act of completed work - legally, it looks like you just “helped voluntarily.” And now your “partner” is using that against you.\n\n**Here is what I would advise you:**\n\n1. **Stop working for free.** If someone doesn’t respect you as a partner, don’t give them your work for nothing. Free work kills respect.\n2. **Document what you have built.** Save the code, structure, repositories, architecture - everything that proves you are the creator. Make a backup. This is your intellectual property.\n3. **Talk calmly but firmly.** Say: “I appreciate what we built together, but I can’t keep working without payment and clear terms. Either we sign an agreement about shares and compensation, or I step away from the project.” No emotions, just a clear, adult conversation.\n4. **Don’t be afraid to walk away.** You’re young, and you have many opportunities ahead. One toxic ‘visionary’ doesn’t define your future. It’s better to lose an illusionary share in a bad project than to lose time and self-respect.\n5. **Learn the lesson.** Real partnership means both sides contribute something valuable - one brings money, the other brings skills - but it must be formalized. Friendship is friendship, but business is business.\n\n**Most importantly:** don’t be bitter. This isn’t a failure, it’s your first business lesson.  \nWe’ve all gone through something like this. The main thing is not to lose faith in yourself and never let anyone use your talent for free.",

Spend some cathartic time talking with friends about what an asshole he was.\n\nFirst thing first.  Cut your losses.  If you control the product, shut it down, take it away, break the code.  Whatever.  Make sure he doesn't get anything else from you.  End the relationship, take anything you can get easily and be done.\n\nSecond thing.  Make a list of the things you keep from this negative experience.  I've lost money and huge amounts of time to a bad partner.  BUT, the work I did, the knowledge I gained, the lessons I learn and take away are mine no matter what.  No one can take this away from you.  You have skills, abilities and lessons that will forever be yours.\n\nThird thing.  Focus on these good things that came out of this shitty situation.   There are many like listed above.  These are the ways you become wise and experienced.   They set you apart.   Bad outcomes at an early age shape you and give you wisdom your contemporaries don't have.   Spend time understanding and processing these good things.\n\nMy take away from my bad partner was to not have partners.  I will always own my companies 100% or with my wife.  A partner is effectively like chosing a wife.  It is that important.  Problem is, you'll never know your partner well enough.  I understand that it is difficult to build a business alone so I'm happy to have employees, contractors, etc help, but not a partner.  I believe that reciprocal service contracts are the solution if required.  My business helps your business, we exchange services according to a year to year contract (\"evergreen contract continues until a decision to stop\").  This way, when a situation comes up where your contractual partner behaves in an untenable way, the contract is severed, but the business is preserved.\n\nSorry about your situation.  Sorry your partner took advantage of you.  Learn, grow and prosper.",

Start documenting everything - screenshots, emails, call notes - in a timestamped document system. Email it to yourself or use something like OneDrive which has version history. Start parsing notes for the “story” you want to track.\n\n3. Reduce your communication with this guy. Give longer messages less frequently. Give yourself time to think about what you want to say, and give him time to send whatever he wants to say before you respond (like if he’s bullying you, just let him rage text a bunch and respond later to everything).\n\n4. Prepare yourself to say / write whatever is true and professional. This is a good lesson at your age. It’s never too early to stand up for yourself without anger or aggression. Say it like it is. It’s a mistake to assume that being nice and agreeable is good for the relationship. Be truthful and kind, but also direct and say the thing that’s uncomfortable. “The company has an asset because of me. I believe I am entitled to more ownership if I’m not being paid. That would be fair. Ideally we would have determined ownership by the value each founder is bringing to the table.” Say it in the mirror 100 times 100 different ways.\n\n5. Be flexible but set a standard for yourself. You’re now becoming the person you will someday be. If you accept a low standard, it may feel less painful now, but it will hurt a lot more in the long run. Keep growing through frustration. “The pain is the price.” And pain is temporary anyway.",

          "body": "So, there's a **lot** to unpack here, and there's a **lot** of information missing. \n\n\nFirst things first, then: Everything here is going to be wobbly, for a few reasons. You've stated that English isn't your primary language, which *generally* indicates that you are not in the United States. Most people on Reddit (including myself) are US residents, so our thoughts are going to be strongly influenced by customs, laws, and business practices prevalent here in the US. You will need to compare anything here against what standards exist where you live. In other words, take this as general advice, not specific guidance. \n\n\nSecondly, you stated you are still in high school. That adds depth to the legal and business standards \"wobble\", because so many legal rights are contingent on your age. \n\n\nThird and last, there's a significant factor missing from the equation, independent of the first two - how is your business structured. You mentioned a partner, but there's very little (essentially, none) mentioned about how your business is organized - both practical and legal. One guy does the relationship stuff, one guy does the technical stuff.\n\n\nSo, with all of that out of the way, I am going to approach this from the perspective that you are of legal age, and that your country has the same legal and business standards of (most of) the United States. Keep that in mind and adjust accordingly. \n\n\nYou need to begin by assessing your business structure, and ownership of your work product. If you're the sole owner of your work product, in all honesty, you hold the cards here. The way you describe it, your business \"partner\" is a parasite. He's using your tangible, functional product to generate (or attempt to generate) revenue, and either failing to fairly compensate you from that revenue or failing to monetize your product at all. \n\n\nSo, if you have a viable and beneficial product, what is stopping you from simply ending your \"partnership\" with this person? Do you have a contractual obligation to them? If so, who created this obligation? What terms were discussed when this agreement was created? Contracts have to have equitable consideration to be valid - if your agreement has become \"you do all the work, and get nothing in return\", then your contract could be in breach. What remedies did you agree to if the contract was breached? Did the two of you even have the discussion about how things can end? \n\n\nAs a little bit of wisdom for the future: a very good way to know if you want to partner with someone is if they actively discuss what happens if/when *something goes wrong*. What happens if one of you dies? Gets sick? If you are sued? Who owns what if you dissolve your partnership? Business isn't \"let's join forces and get rich\" (which is exactly what I hear you describing) but rather \"let's join forces and solve a constant stream of challenges and hopefully be profitable doing it\".\n\n\nLet me ask you this - do you have a successful family member, friend, teacher that you trust? Is there a person in your life that is generous, intelligent, and older? I think you need a mentor. A person who can ask you questions and make you think. Who can offer you advice based on experience and expertise; who has walked this road before and can help you avoid these potholes. \n\n\nIt's a tough thing for the \"nerds\" of the world - you/we tend to take things at face value, because we value accuracy and truth, and struggle to understand how someone would be willing to succeed by cheating. \n\n\nBut, unfortunately, success by lying is extremely common, and it appears your current partner is one of those people. You should start exploring what your options are to dissolve your partnership, and instead find someone who can genuinely point you towards the way forward. \n\n\nCheck with your local colleges, universities, or other institutions of higher learning. Often, they have or are affiliated with \"startup\" organizations - groups that provide funding, resources, networking, and leadership to new businesses. \n\n\nI wish you the best.",

Things like employment contracts can change this.\n\nSo you might well own the stuff you've written.  That'd be good news for you.\n\nThis guy treats you this way because he can.  My (very general) advice would be that you should stop working on any of this stuff until you have an agreement you're happy with and be prepared to walk away if you don't get one.  Don't vandalise anything; don't deliberately take the servers down, but you're under no obligation to help him out when something falls over.\n\nIf nothing else, you'll end up learning a lot from this and you've a concrete example of a project you've built for the future.",

You didn’t get “screwed,” you just saw how business power actually works.\n\nHere’s the blunt truth: without a contract, you own the *work*, but not the *business*. Without pay, you’re not a “partner,” you’re unpaid labor being managed through promises. He’s not paying because he doesn’t have to - you’ve already delivered the product and have no leverage left that he cares about.\n\nWhat you *do* still have is knowledge leverage. You built the system. You know how it works. That means you can walk away, rebuild it cleaner, and showcase it as your portfolio. Quietly back up your code, protect your access, and stop touching his servers so you can’t get blamed later.\n\nDon’t argue with him. Don’t threaten. Just end it clean:\n\n&gt;\n\nAfter that - block, vanish, rebuild.  \nPost what you built (without any private data) on GitHub or a demo site. That story - *“I built a company’s full tech stack at 16”* \\- will open doors for you way faster than chasing this guy ever could.\n\nThis is your first real-world lesson in ownership: if it’s not written down or paid for, it’s not real. Learn it once, never repeat it. Next time, use a simple contract and get partial payment upfront.\n\nTurn the loss into proof that you’re already operating at a higher level than the guy who exploited you.",

          "body": "Workaholism is a common path to success, but it is not the only path. What we tend to call “work-life balance” is usually a moving target, and it looks different at each stage of a company. Early on, intensity often spikes. Later, the founders who keep winning are the ones who build systems that let them work with focus, not just with hours.\n\nSome very successful leaders have been public about strict boundaries, deep work over long work, sabbaticals, or seasonal sprints. Think 4-day or 5-hour workday experiments, no-meeting days, or founders who prioritize long walks, reading, and thinking time. Others design businesses that match their chosen lifestyle, which is a legitimate and difficult kind of ambition. These people are not lazy. They are obsessed with leverage, not with time on task.\n\nWhat you are noticing, that productivity can be a defense against fear, is very common. Fear of failure. Fear of irrelevance. Fear of not being enough. Workaholism can numb those feelings. The problem is that it also numbs creativity, judgment, and relationships. You can build a big company that way, but you pay for it somewhere.\n\nA more useful frame is “sustainable intensity.” You can be extremely ambitious without living at a permanent 11. The trick is to choose where intensity lives.\n\n**A simple playbook:**\n\n1. Decide your non-negotiables. Sleep, family dinners, exercise, spiritual practice, therapy, whatever keeps you sane. Put those in the calendar first and treat them like board meetings.\n2. Work in seasons. Run 6 to 8 week sprints with clear goals, then recover. Sprint, ship, recover, repeat. Always include a cool-down week where you pay down debt and protect thinking time.\n3. Make fear explicit. Write the worst-case scenario, the prevention plan, and the recovery plan. Once fear has a plan, the nervous system calms down and the need to grind for safety drops.\n4. Trade hours for leverage. Hire for outcomes, not roles. Automate reporting. Kill 80 percent of meetings. Replace generic “work more” with one needle-moving action per day.\n5. Protect deep work. Two to four hours a day of distraction-free focus beats ten hours of context switching. Phone in another room, calendar blocks, one shared priority list for the team.\n6. Design for boredom tolerance. If the only way you feel valuable is by staying busy, you will overbuild, overhire, and overcommit. Practice leaving white space, then resist filling it.\n7. Measure the real scoreboard. Energy, clarity, quality of decisions, relationships with your core people. Revenue and growth matter. These leading indicators matter first.\n\nTwo honest conclusions can both be true. One, there are founders who work less than the stereotype and still win because they design for leverage and compounding. Two, most world-class outcomes require aggressive seasons, and pretending otherwise is delusional. The art is choosing intensity on purpose, then letting it end.\n\nIf you are productive because you are scared, you are not broken. You are human. Keep the edge, lose the compulsion. Build a business that can survive your vacation. That is what success looks like when it lasts.",

          "body": "Thanks for bringing up this important question u/Miyamoto_Musashi_x. Having read through the discussion here, I think the real insight several commenters have highlighted is that it's not about the hours themselves but rather the underlying motivation and system architecture.\n\n\n\nThe ilodey comment really stood out with that $2M/year e-commerce example - working 25-30 hours weekly but with extreme intentionality about saying no to non-essentials. That's a fundamentally different approach than grinding 80 hours out of fear.\n\n\n\nI think the most important distinction the community is making here is between two types of busy:\n\n\n\n1. Productive obsession: When you're genuinely passionate about solving a problem. ilooley mentioned coding for 12 hours and feeling energized rather than drained. That's quality work.\n\n\n\n2. Anxious busyness: Running from fear as you mentioned. The constant email checking, weekend work, guilt when stopping. That's burnout waiting to happen.\n\n\n\nLooking at comments from lapserdak1 and mrgoldweb, the theme is clear - successful entrepreneurs who maintain balance built systems and processes that don't require their constant presence. They delegated, automated, and scaled thinking rather than scaled their own hours.\n\n\n\nThe reality is probably that yes, you'll likely work a lot in the early stages. But that phase should be about building the infrastructure so you don't have to forever. Not every business model allows for this (as electricgnome and others pointed out), but it's worth being intentional about which business models you choose.\n\n\n\nThe test several people mentioned - can you take a week off without anxiety - is brilliant. That's your indicator of whether you've actually built a business or just created a demanding job.\n\n\n\nAppreciate you sparking this conversation. These nuances about productive work versus anxious work are crucial for entrepreneurs to understand early.",

Instead I took him to different creative events, related conferences, to listen to how others succeed in the very competitive illustrationist world.\n\nConsider that hundreds of thousands if not millions  compete in a given organized sport.  Only ten of thousands get to compete at the highest college levels and only five hundred get to join the professional ranks.  An acqaintance was to be drafted professionally but before the draft he had a major injury.  So he never made the professional ranks.

I have noticed AI to be better than humans, me or my team at two specific things already\n\n**Writing Code When Prompted Well:** We have noticed tools like Cursor, and Windsurf, with their AI agents like Cascade, can quickly implement new features by writing code and even testing it. As long as its well defined and you know what you are doing, it seem to be able to build features that used to take weeks to build within minutes. Our team is shipping features daily now and its insane how much more productive our engineering team is now! For what I have seen, its turning engineers into basically managers- you need to learn how to talk to it correctly but when done, its like having 10 people under you who can implement at lightning speed\n\n**Understanding Large Amount of Data**:  We have noticed AI tools like Frizerly and Pulse are really good at looking at 1000+ keywords on Google search console performance data to seamlessly come up with great SEO strategies for us. Yes, it can even automatically publish blogs based on this strategy for you, but I am more impressed about how it can ingest vast amount of data and come up with a great SEO strategy in seconds that would have taken a lot of money and time if we had hired external agencies.\n\nSo that would be the two for us!

It should elevate human capability.\n\nWhen I built my ecosystem, I treated it like any complex system. Everything interacts. Nothing moves in isolation. That is why the idea of AI replacing researchers misses the real issue. Anyone calling humans as disposable or useless does not understand systems or risk. A society that devalues people eventually collapses.\n\nAI does not replace intelligence. It removes the mechanical drag that blocks humans from using their intelligence. Scraping data and verifying inputs is computational labor. Machines can handle that so people can focus on thinking.\n\nAI can outperform researchers on mechanical throughput, but it cannot outthink a researcher on meaning, framing, or interpretation without a human-designed architecture guiding it. The goal is not automation of thought. The goal is freeing human bandwidth. AI takes the tasks. Humans keep the intelligence. \n\nHuman capability expands when people are given better tools. AI is simply the next tool. What matters now is building responsible intelligence with discipline, empathy, and governance.\n\nApparently, ChatGPT has an IQ of 148. However, in my opinion IQ is only raw pattern horsepower, AI does not measure meaning, wisdom, judgment, intuition, ethics, context, values, or emotional reasoning, which is functional intelligence that strictly belongs to humans.",

I get some good use out of LLMs as a turbo stack overflow to remember syntax I've forgotten when switching between SQL engines and things like that, but claude borks some really weird stuff quite often for me that kind of sabotages my confidence in any sort of hands-off work I might want to hand over to it.\n\nFriday I was getting tired and needed to finish writing some data pipeline code. I had a sample file downloaded for the DDL I wanted to create a schema for, and the table has like 50+ columns so I was hoping I could just get claude to pop out CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS statement for me, with cols in the right order. I'd handle the data typing from there. \n\nI paste in a transposed snippet of the column headers from my sample file and explain that I just want the CREATE TABLE statement with column names, they can all be varchar for now. First attempt is 37 columns. I'm like hey that's not all the columns. Next attempt is 41. Some columns are also added that are *not* in the sample file. This would obviously break everything if I just ran with it. \n\nEnded up just using a CONCAT in excel which took less time than the back and forth. Don't get me wrong, sometimes LLMs are more helpful than I expect, but on some things like this, they're so bad that I'm like \"how could I ever trust this without spending so much time validating that I could've just done it myself in the same amount of time.\"\n\nEDIT: The downvotes without replies are amusing given the context of this thread and reply. You guys turning LLMs loose on sensitive data in the wild? Lol thanks for the job security.",

It excels at research, summarising information, and identifying trends in data at an astonishing speed far beyond our capabilities.\n\nHowever, humans still retain an edge in judgement and creativity, particularly in understanding why certain ideas resonate with people. While AI may process information rapidly, it lacks the depth and insight that human intuition provides.",

It doesn't matter how many designs or UX models you create, until you get the real thing in front of a user who can click and type their way through it, you aren't going to know if it's what they want or not.\n\nSo AI now means we can have working features in front of clients very quickly, minor changes can be done with the user next to us. The whole user feedback loop and iteration process has sped up maybe 10x over.\n\nThe other thing is has done - it has opened the door to the opportunity to try almost anything myself. It doesn't matter that I've never used Adobe Premiere Pro before, ChatGPT will talk me through the steps I need to follow to do exactly the task that I want it to do. I've never used Blender before either, but now Manus is helping me create a new physical product that I can advertise on my Shopify store to test market fit before I go to manufacture stage.\n\nThese are the sort of things I would have had to either find a friend to help me with and get them to fit in a time that was convenient for them, or go to something like Fiverr or Upwork and get a freelancer to do it for me, with all the overhead that would entail.",

Or competition). But it feels like because i already got wealthy i have just lost that Killer instinct. \n\nMy rational mind says figure it out.  Build and sell new business and focus, then make a run on the creative endeavors again. \n\nHas anyone else \"peaked\" and gotten the spark back?",

But some people are just in it for the game, the end goal isn’t to win and make money, it’s to watch that line go up, to see how far they can really take it. \n\nMy solution to this problem was to plan it out long term. I don’t wanna build to sell, I want to build to retire. Your problem now was that you went back out of necessity. And it just became another job. A possible solution is don’t sell, don’t leave, keep it for as long as you can. Find a way to distance yourself from the day to day and let it run itself.

When you start to get good at that, then you’ll be able to help your team chase impact.\n\nEdit to add: if others don’t honor time commitments/limits it’s even more important that you do when it comes to meetings.  It’s not a cold turkey change but you can influence your team, vendors, investors etc. overtime by being consistent in how you focus meetings on actionable outcomes.",

When I am heading to the meeting I usually know what I am responsible for and what is important. I usually use the title and description of the meeting on teams to prepare and write a short punch list of what I need from it and what I need to execute. Then if the meeting goes past the allotted time I excuse myself saying \"I think I have what I need from this meeting can I be excused? I really have some important objectives to achieve in the next hour.\" I usually do not get pushback from setting boundaries. Meetings usually have a set time allotment and I try not to go past that time period. If it is completely off track I write down important questions for that department before I leave and send a clarification email after leaving. The whole point of meetings is to relay information. If the person who is in charge does not relay information in an efficient manner it is not your fault and your work is just as important as everyone else's. So set meeting boundaries and make sure you get what you need while you are there. Never leave before the time allotment and only engage in longer than anticipated meetings if your superior or his superior is present. Excuse yourself in any meeting you can as soon as the time has run over. If you can delegate tasks to AI or someone competent and close and have them send you detailed notes to review at your convenience. Your time is money 🤑 the less you have the freedom to use it the lower your income. If you are the boss then delegation should be top priority by choosing capable reports to handle 90% of the busy work. 5% of the people handle payroll, accounting, and I'm invoicing. The last 5% is yours to plan at your leisure.",

Six months in and it's the opposite.\n\nIts funny, nearly every post I make on this Subreddit says this, but no one listens. Entrepreneurship isn't taking control, it is giving up more of it, especially when you're first getting started.\n\nYou cease answering to a boss and begin answering to staff, contractors, investors, clients, tax men, bankers, vendors, and more.\n\nHaving a single person to answer to is a luxury people fail to see until they're drowning.\n\n&gt;7 hours of meetings yesterday. Then spent hours trying to remember what was decided in each one. \\[...\\] The worst part? Keeping track of it all. Who said what, when things are due, which client needs what follow-up. I'm constantly scrambling through scattered notes trying to piece together what was actually agreed upon.\n\nProject managers, especially those who are experts in specialized methods like Scrum or Canban, etc, are paid a lot of money to teach teams systems of managing projects. Bosses are project managers. You need to learn how to manage your tasks, commitments, and duties and prioritize, triage, and complete them.\n\nDo you know 4 out of 5 small businesses fail in 5 years? Because their owners think they can fire a boss and do the same thing with less stress. Nope, you now are the boss, and everything you took for granted at the place you once worked is now on you... project management, sales, bookkeeping, hr, and more.\n\nYou can fix this. See below.\n\n&gt;Everything is \"urgent\" and \"quick 15-minute chats\" turn into hour-long requirement sessions.\n\nWelcome to an important thing called: setting boundaries. Plan 30 or 60 minute chats, and keep you and your fellow meeting person on task. If someone says \"I have a 15-minute quick question\", and it isn't, talk to them about ways they can better prepare themselves and you so you do not overrun the schedule. Require follow-ups if you can't finish, but also, teach the people you work with that your time is valuable and brevity and directness is mandatory and respectful.\n\n&gt;I'm drowning in administrative overhead and playing catch-up on commitments I made in meetings I can barely remember.\n\nThis isn't a symptom of too many meetings, this is a symptom of a lack of a lack of organization and lack of knowledge how to get organized. Not to be harsh, but this is a you problem not an entrepreneurship problem. That said, welcome to the biz.\n\nYou can learn what you need to know.\n\nTake notes. Create to-do items from meetings. Use productivity tools to keep track of items. Use Canban or Scrum methods to track items. Task management apps can be formatted toward those techniques. Create summaries you can easily access every start of work day. \n\nIf you can't keep track of choices you and your team make, you're not ready to do this thing you're doing.\n\nPerhaps put a one-week pause on new meetings and focus on learning a system to stay organized.",

There’s no external validation for a long, long time.\n* *Small wins matter*: It’s not always the “big launch” that keeps you going, but the tiny unexpected email, the positive feedback, the day you solve a bug that’s been crushing you.\n* *Sacrifice*: Friendships change, schedules implode. Most people only see the highlights, not the isolation or self-doubt.\n\nI’m curious:(being a SaaS Founder myself)\n\n* What’s one unfiltered reality you wish you’d known before starting?\n* How do you handle the emotional rollercoaster during the silent phases... when there’s no traction yet and momentum feels slow?\n* Any routines, mindsets, or support systems that keep you grounded through the ups and downs?\n\nLet’s swap real stories and support, especially for newer founders who need to hear that the gritty parts are normal, and often the most important.",

I know doubt and uncertainty will always be there, but yeah someone have to do the work, no one is coming to hold you and make you to achieve what you want, only you have to do it. You are the responsible for all of that. Just make sure love the journey and document it, and when you feel like you are not going anywhere look at those documents, and you will understand how far you came from an idea to a real existing thing. These things that i am saying feels like motivation but i think that it is psychological thing, kind of build a mindset of keep going. \n\nI will say take it as a war or like a game, if you heard of dark souls, follow that mindset. \n\nI am still on this journey, and i am with you, and i also face the same things everyday ,that you mentioned.

          "body": "Agree with everything OP says. In addition, the hardest truth I learnt is that the feeling of not being good enough never really goes away. You always learn more every day, realise you didn't think of something and have to learn yet another thing from scratch. You start questioning whether you really know anything at all. That feeling paralyses you from doing the learning, being productive and you end up procrastinating because you're overwhelmed. It's important to accept that this feeling won't end.\n\nThe other hard truth I learnt is that without your health, there is no business. I used to be really proud of my lifestyle. Woke up at 5, went to the gym, and ate well and was in incredible shape and was very organised, disciplined, and productive. After being a founder, I feel like I've lost control of everything. I felt guilty for spending time looking after myself and resting. I felt like I should always be working and stopped going gym, ate whatever, slept at random times and tried to work continuously. I've slowly and finally accepted that you need to take days off to rest, eat, and sleep properly. Otherwise, you will burn out fast, and end up being unproductive and inconsistent.\n\nHandling the emotional roller coaster is a beast, but what helped me is talking to other founders and someone who can hold you accountable. I started telling some of the people I see at the gym that I will be there on this day. They're expecting me so I turn up. Same with anything you have been procrastinating on, set a deadline and get someone to hold you accountable. It does work for the short term when you are struggling, and you get stuff done so you don't look stupid. Eventually, you gain control of it yourself and form the discipline necessary. \n\nI've also found that not getting excited regardless of what is happening, whether that is good or bad, keeps me in a balanced emotional state to make sound business decisions. I hope you are doing okay, and it will pay off. Believe in yourself and your dreams.",

I do all of the work myself. So it's definitely a lot of time invested, probably like 8 months to set everything up - but I think it's worth it. Let's say my monthly opportunity cost is about 2000/month right now, as I still have unemployment benefits. 2000 x 8 = 16k + 10k = 26k in investments to start my business. I'm planning to launch in January 2026 myself.\n\nSo to answer your question, would I do the same if I could? Definitely!

The truth is, we have so many opportunities today, and our ambitions are much higher than they were a decade or two ago. I heard a quote the other day that really made me stop and think:\n\n“Kids in the 80s aspired to have a house, a car, a steady job, and maybe one holiday a year. Today, kids aspire to have a private jet, a yacht, travel the world, and work four hours a week.”\n\nOur entire mindset has shifted, we’re constantly chasing something new, a bigger goal, and the grass has never looked greener on the other side. The fear of missing out is completely out of control.\n\nWhat helps me stay grounded is going for long walks in nature just enjoying the smells, the trees, the sounds, and spending time with the people I love most. I try to treat each part of my life as equally important and give my full attention to each one.\n\nWhen it comes to goals, I see them as marathons, not sprints. I set aside time to work on them, and as long as I give my best, I know I’ll have no regrets. I try not to get distracted by what others are doing but stay curious enough to learn from them.\n\nThese simple habits help me stay focused, enjoy life, and keep chasing what truly matters to me.",

And that's not a failure, that's just reality. Your brain isn't built to focus on ten things equally, and the moment you try to, you end up doing a mediocre job at all of them instead of a great job at a few.\n\nSo here's what's helped me when I was drowning like you are right now:\n\n**First, stop trying to do everything equally.** Instead, figure out what absolutely cannot wait this week, and what can sit in the background for a bit. University work and your cousin's startup probably have deadlines. Your personal projects? They can wait a week or two without the world ending. Same with staying visible online. It's better to post one banger piece of content when you have the mental space than force out mediocre stuff daily just to \"stay consistent.\"\n\n**Second, accept that some things will slip.** You mentioned that when you focus on one thing, five others start falling apart. Yeah, that's gonna happen. But here's the secret: those five things aren't actually falling apart forever. They're just on pause. You'll come back to them. The key is knowing the difference between \"pausing\" and \"quitting.\" You're not quitting, you're just prioritizing.\n\n**Third, rejections suck. Period.** They make you question everything. But here's what I learned after getting rejected from like a hundred things: rejection doesn't mean you're going in the wrong direction. It just means that particular path wasn't it. You're still moving forward, you're still learning, you're still building. Some of my biggest wins came right after my worst rejections because I used that anger and disappointment as fuel to go even harder.",

          "body": "Man, I could’ve written this myself a few months ago. Hell, I’m still living parts of it.\n\nI’m a developer with about 58+ projects in various states of “almost done.” I’d get things to 80-90% complete, get excited about the next idea, and jump ship. Rinse and repeat for years. The problem wasn’t motivation or even discipline - it was that I genuinely wanted to do ALL of it.\nHere’s what’s actually helping me (I’m not going to pretend I’ve figured it all out, but I’m further than I’ve ever been)\n\nThe 70/30 Rule\n\nI picked ONE primary project to actually finish. 70% of my work time goes there, no exceptions. The other 30%? That’s my creative relief valve. I work on whatever excites me that day. This keeps me from feeling creatively suffocated while still making real progress on the thing that matters.\n\nNoting vs. Acting\n\nThis one changed everything. When I get an idea during work time, I note it down and keep working. I don’t act on it. Sounds simple, but it’s hard as hell when you’re someone who gets excited about new things. The idea gets captured, I don’t lose it, but I also don’t derail my day.\n\nExternal Accountability\n\nYou mentioned not having friends to talk through this with - I get that. I use an AI coach (Claude, actually) for structured weekly check-ins. Sunday planning, mid-week pulse check, Saturday review. Having something outside my own head that tracks whether I’m actually doing what I said I would has been huge.\n\nTiny, Specific Tasks\n\nNot “work on project.” But “spend 2 hours fixing the login bug” or “write product description.” Small enough that I can’t hide from them. Specific enough that I know when they’re done. I use iPhone Reminders because complex systems just add friction.\n\nAccepting the Pattern\n\nI’ve had to get brutally honest about my pattern: I build things, get them almost done, then find reasons not to launch (usually “just one more feature”). Knowing this doesn’t make it go away, but it helps me catch it. When I start finding “one more thing,” I can ask myself: is this actually needed, or am I scared to ship?\nHere’s something I’m learning: finishing ONE thing imperfectly is worth more than building ten things to 80%. The confidence from actually shipping something real changes how you see yourself.\n\nI’m not where I want to be yet. But I’m closer than I’ve ever been because I stopped trying to hold everything and started finishing one thing. The rest can wait.",

      "selftext": "So a week back I posted about building an AI voice agent for a dental office. Got a ton of helpful feedback from you guys, especially about my pricing being way too low.\n\nYou were completely right.\n\nWhat happened:\n\nSomeone here actually forwarded that post to their dentist. The dentist reached out asking if I could do the same for their office. We hopped on a call, did a quick demo with their actual phone line, and they were in.\n\nThis time I quoted $1197 setup and $497 monthly instead of what I was charging before. Expected some pushback but they didn't even blink. Just asked when we could start.\n\nMade me realize I was pricing based on my effort instead of their problem. They're losing patients every time a call goes to voicemail because people just call the next dentist on Google.\n\nReal results:\n\nFirst week the system answered calls after hours and booked 4 appointments. The office manager told me they can actually finish their lunch breaks now without stressing about the phone constantly ringing.\n\nWhat I learned:\n\nDental offices already budget $2000-3000 monthly for part time reception help. When you frame it that way, the pricing makes complete sense to them.\n\nAlso when you charge appropriately people respect your work more. This client trusts the system and doesn't micromanage every little thing like before when I undercharged.\n\nMain takeaway - price based on the value you're creating for them, not what it costs you to make. That mindset shift changed everything.\n\nAnyway just wanted to share since this community pushed me to fix my pricing. Wouldn't have made the adjustment without the feedback here.",

Also, if Reddit keeps sending you leads, tbh I’d set up alerts so you don’t miss those threads. I use DitDo to catch high-intent posts and it’s been solid for service niches like dental and med spas.

Move part of your business online-courses, subscriptions, SaaS, info products. If you’re mostly offline, ask yourself what you can sell without being hands-on all the time.\n\n3. Outsource what’s not core. Anything that doesn’t directly create value for your clients, hand it to freelancers or contractors. Accounting, design, social media-let someone else handle it.\n\n4. Create clear systems and instructions. Step-by-step guides, checklists-so people can do their job without you hovering.\n\n5. Make decisions based on data, not activity. Don’t track how many hours someone works-track results. Look at how many clients each channel brings, not how busy your team is.\n\n6. Focus on your best clients and products.

What is the long term goal for you/ this business?\n\nI coach a lot of small business owners who want growth (revenue and profits) without adding payroll yet and we always look at these 3 strategies or areas BEFORE hiring:\n1. Remove bottlenecks\nWhere exactly is the constraint?\nLead gen? Response time? Close rate? Delivery/fulfillment?\nFixing the constraint usually unlocks growth with the current team.\n\n2. Systematize repetitive tasks\nIf you do something more than twice a week that should be templated, automated, or delegated to tech.\nAI is fantastic here, think of it as your first “junior assistant” that handles low-level repetitive work.\nAlso as has been stated, VAs can be a huge help.\n\n3. Improve conversion before adding capacity.\nYou don’t need more people if you can get more out of what’s already happening.\nMost small businesses leak revenue through poor follow-up and inconsistent processes.\n\nGrowth doesn’t automatically mean more humans. Often, growth simply means tightening the system so the existing humans can produce more.",

Then out of nowhere, she messages me saying she wants to return it because it “looks better at a lower level.” Her exact words were basically that the eyes looked off when she put it higher up.\n\nI told her nicely that I can’t take it back for that reason. The piece looks exactly like the photos, and I’m not a big company that can just eat losses because someone didn’t like how it looked on a shelf. I’m one person making and shipping these myself.\n\nShe didn’t like that. She got defensive, saying my question “didn’t make sense” and that the “advertising didn’t match her hopes.” Whatever that means.\n\nThen she started opening return cases. Three of them. Each time she gave a new reason. The last one? She claimed the item was “defective.” Totally false. Nothing wrong with it, she just didn’t like how it looked where she put it.\n\nAnd guess what? Amazon **refunded her in full** without even checking if she returned it. She didn’t. She still has the piece and the money.\n\nSo now I’m out the cost, the time, and the product, all because someone abused the return system and Amazon just automatically sided with her. No evidence, no verification, nothing.\n\nI reported everything to Amazon and posted about it on the forums because this is getting ridiculous. I followed every rule. The listing was accurate. The photos were clear. And yet somehow, a customer can just say “defective” and walk away with both the product and a full refund.\n\nI’m honestly just fed up. This kind of thing might be nothing to a big company, but for a small artist, it hurts.",

I’m hoping for some guidance across a few subreddits because I feel like I'm at a breaking point.\n\nI’m almost 40 and make about $70k a year, but after a lot of self-reflection and working with a professional, I’ve confirmed that my mental health issues are coming directly from the work itself. I’ve tried switching jobs, but everything I’m qualified for ends up being another desk job. And I just can’t do it anymore.\n\nI’d rather work 60+ hours a week *for myself* than keep forcing myself through a 9–5 where I’m chained to a computer. I don’t need to be rich—I just need to be stable and sane.\n\nI live in a rural area (Sayre, PA). Here, everyone and their cousin runs a handyman service, landscaping business, or garden business—so breaking into those feels like fighting over scraps. I don’t have a trade license, and I can’t afford to reboot a whole career while paying my mortgage.\n\n**But I** ***do*** **have $70,000 saved right now that I can put toward building something of my own.**\n\nMy question is:  \n**What can someone in my position reasonably do with $70k to break free from traditional office work and build a self-sustaining career?**\n\nI’m open to:\n\n* Service-based businesses\n* Mobile businesses\n* Online/remote businesses that *aren’t* corporate desk jobs\n* Buying equipment and starting something myself\n* Anything that gets me out of a cubicle and gives me control over my schedule\n\nI’m not afraid of long hours. I’m not afraid of hard physical work. I just need something that isn’t slowly destroying my mental health.\n\n**If you were in my situation—rural area, almost 40, $70k saved, burned out from office life—what would you do? What opportunities am I not seeing?**\n\nAny real-world advice or ideas from people who’ve made a similar transition would mean a lot.\n\nThank you.",

I get why you are done with the office stuff, and the fact that you have seventy thousand saved puts you in a very strong position.\n\nThe one piece of advice I would give you is this. Do not stop working under any circumstances. That savings buys you flexibility, not a full exit. What it really gives you is the chance to move into something lower stress and more tolerable while you build your own thing on the side. That can be a simple job, something physical, something that brings a bit of joy or at least does not drain you the way a desk job does. But having some income and staying in the working world matters a lot.\n\nIf you walk away completely, start a business, and it fails, coming back in will be much harder. Your work history stalls, your network gets cold, and your confidence takes a hit. If you keep even a part time job, you keep income, structure, and connections while you experiment.\n\nUse the seventy thousand to remove pressure, not to replace income. Let your business grow slowly and organically on the side. Test ideas, try small bets, learn what actually works for you. When the income from your business is consistently beating what you can earn with your time at a job, and it clearly needs more of your hours to keep growing, that is when you quit. Until then, adjust your job, lower your hours if you can, choose something easier if you need to, but do not stop working.",

You need to love what you are doing, have the drive to stick at it no matter what, and the ability to do it well.  \n\nDoing what I do, something in the artisan space, it probably one of the easier paths if you are good at the kind of thing.

At this point I am so consumed in my business.I don't even know what to do on a sunday when the wife goes to the playground with the baby. My only goal is to be able to constantly provide for my child and my family and the long run. I highly recommend you make sure it is really what you want to do.

As long as you have a telephone and are able to say hello , and speak to people , you can make a decent living. A computer definitely helps.

You honestly could come pretty close to replacing your income within a year flipping stuff on ebay, marketplace, poshmark, mercari, etc etc. I started flipping a few years ago, just temporarily to supplement my income when things got tight. You learn a ton in a short period of time, and the community is open and willing to help newbies. It is a lot of work, and organization skills are useful. Doesn't take too much to get started, and if you can find a niche that's where you'll be most successful. Some flippers just make a few hundred bucks a month, some make a good full time living, and then there are superstars. My good friends brother in-law found a niche in some kind of specialized equipment/machinery, and that's pretty much all he focuses on now, and he ships a lot internationally. Within a few years he has a large warehouse and last I knew was generating over $1M/year in revenue. Best of luck to you. I would recommend just starting slow, and don't rush into spending your life savings. Feel free to message if you'd like more info on what I've learned about flipping.",

Take away the phone and laptop and it’s even worse.\n\nA saying that I’ve had for awhile now:\n\n“It’s way easier to make $100,000 than it is to make $1,000.”",

So step one would be to reach out to insurance to make the claim and get that process going.\n\nI have sales records and have been breaking previous sales records pretty consistently. I can present both the insurance and my business records to my bank and see if I can get a loan to cover the insurance gap.\n\nIn the mean time, as a computer professional, I’d continue to provide a service to my customers and the income would continue to flow. Reach out to my customers and see if additional work could be had. Dig in and see if I can find new customers.\n\nOnce the insurance money arrives, I will reach out to local workers to get my store back in shape (depending on the disaster, maybe a new location or just on-line sales). If I do get a bank loan, use it to augment the buildout and with insurance, get product into the store.\n\nAnd back in business.",

      "selftext": "EDIT / i was not expecting this to blow up so much, but please know me and my partner spent the entire day today repositioning ourselves in preparation for our meeting with the client. i am meeting with him tomorrow morning and will post an update … thank you all so so much 😭 forcing me to think bigger, and face my self deeply \n\n\n\n\nMy business partner and I run a social media content  agency (2 years old, 17 active clients). One of our founding clients has approached us about going exclusive - they want us to dissolve our agency and work only for them as their dedicated in-house marketing team.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- 17 clients generating solid revenue ($48K per month) \n\n- 9-person team (2 partners + 7 staff)\n\n- Client proposing exclusive deal has been with us since Year 1 (currently paying $9500/mo) \n\n- They've grown significantly with us (but only getting ~15-20% of our bandwidth currently)\n\n- They're our largest single client but represent &lt;20% of our revenue \n\n**The Proposal:**\n- 12-month exclusive contract\n- We'd reduce from 9 to 4 people (me, business partner, 2 key team members)\n- Compensation: Base monthly retainer + 10% commission on their course/digital product sales\n- Scope: Personal brand, company brand, course business, potential support for spouse's brand\n- We'd be walking away from 80%+ of our current revenue to take this\n\n**The Numbers Being Discussed:**\n- $379K for the 4 person team ($144k yearly salary  for me and my partner each) \n- Commission could add $10-50K+ if we scale their course business\n- This would roughly match our current personal income but with commission upside (currently making $7k a month + building cash reserve for agency) \n- We'd go from managing 17 clients to 100% focus on one brand ecosystem\n\n**What We're Torn On:**\n\nPros:\n- Simplified operations (1 client vs 17)\n- Higher personal income potential with commission structure\n- Deep partnership with someone we've proven success with\n- 12-month contract = stability\n- Elimination of constant sales/client management\n- Can build elite expertise in one vertical\n\n**Cons:**\n- 100% concentration risk\n- Walking away from $460K+ annual revenue from other clients\n- Pausing agency growth trajectory (we could hit $1M+ in 3-5 years)\n- If it fails, we rebuild from zero\n- Letting go of 5 team members\n- No diversification\n\n**Questions for You:**\n\n1. **Has anyone made a similar pivot?** How did it turn out?\n\n2. **Is $30-32K/month + 10% commission fair** for dissolving a multi-client agency and going exclusive? Or are we undervaluing ourselves?\n\n3. **Red flags we should watch for?** Client has been great for 2 years, but exclusive relationships can change dynamics.\n\n4. **Contract terms we absolutely need?** We're thinking 12-month minimum, quarterly advance payments, 90-day notice. What are we missing?\n\n5. **How do you value opportunity cost?** Is the simplified life worth the concentration risk?\n\n6. **Anyone regret going exclusive?** What would you do differently?\n\n**Additional Context:**\n- Client is ready to scale (proven product-market fit with their course)\n- They have budget and seem committed\n- We'd still own our systems/processes\n- Could theoretically rebuild agency if this ends\n\n**The Real Question:**\nAre we crazy for even considering this? Or is this the kind of focused partnership that could be more valuable than spreading ourselves thin across 17 clients?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who's faced a similar decision - especially if you've been on either side of an exclusive arrangement.\n\n**Edit:** To clarify - we're not desperate or struggling. Agency is healthy and growing. This is purely a strategic decision about depth vs. breadth.",

The security is an illusion. You go from being an independent business owner to an employee so you lose your freedom and mobility. No doubt the contract will protect him more than it protects you. And the final nail in the coffin is that you lose your ability to truly scale. \n\nInstead, counter him. Tell him you will provide an exclusive team that will operate under contract with his business and they will have no other accounts. That team of 4 will be under a noncompete with you for 5-10 years so none of them get the same offer you got and strike out on their own with this client as their first. You will also still take the retainer to lead this team independently of the remainder of your business, and the salary should be paid to your company to then be distributed to the employees based on their contract with you.\n\nDon’t destroy what you built for the illusion of safety and predictability.

They do not get exclusivity on either you or your partner, but they do get a dedicated client manager within the SLA you negotiate.",

          "body": "As laid out it's not clear why this would make sense to do.  The biggest issue is you are giving up a stable situation with a lot of long-term upside for a position that only has a short-term guarantee and that introduces a lot of risk.  \n\nI would encourage you to consider the exclusive deal as something more like an acquisition.  If they were buying your company, they would have to pay you the value of the current business, and/or in some combination give you a job at a guaranteed rate for some length of time, plus some earn-out and/or success-based compensation.  This is something like what they are proposing, except the guarantee isn't very long, and even if you max out the commission, it doesn't seem like they are paying you enough to throw away the rest of your business.  They would also have to be paying you enough to walk away from the future growth of that business -- just as in an acquisition, except you might not be looking to sell if you still have a lot of value-maximization to do in growing the company.  It's hard to imagine them ever wanting to pay enough for a 1-year deal with you to balance all that out, but if you want to exit to them and can get them to pay for the terminal value of the business, maybe it's a conversation.\n\nIt's also unclear what is motivating them to do this.  Are they not getting enough resources from you?  Get a larger guarantee from them and scale up the team serving them.  Give them some kind of preferred rate and priority SLA in exchange for it, and make sure X% of your personal time is focused on that business.  Spend the rest of your time and/or find other folks to keep growing the business that is not with this client.",

If you want to sell your soul and work for the man again, then consider the deal. Otherwise take the solid advice laid out here by others and set this account up with a curated team. Make sure the contract has a no solicitation clause for your top talent who will work the account and that your margins are set at a high enough level (higher than now) to compensate you for the loss of these team members on your other accounts. After all, you are incurring an opportunity cost by taking them out of service to others. Also consider emphasizing to the client that they do currently benefit from the fact that you are actively working in the same and perhaps other industries that will keep your content cutting edge sharp. If they insist on bringing it in house and they are a big enough growth partner, offer to help them set it up, find a few employees and provide 100 percent cooperation with their internal team.  Then, stay involved in the account growth… the new internal team does the simple stuff to save them some $ and give them the speed to market or whatever controls they are craving and you do the amazing, impactful, big idea work. Set up a mutual progress meeting quarterly. If they want exclusivity within their specific industry, no problem, but that costs more (unless this is not an issue for you) Good luck and remember, being your own bosses is why you are here!!

Crafting a unique selling proposition (USP) that differentiates your SaaS.  A great book on that is Positioning by Al Ries.  Offer is the most neglected area that I see businesses avoid.  They think the thing they sell, should sell itself.\n\n2. Awareness.  Getting your offer in front of your favorite kinds of customers until you've reached 100% market saturation.  Awareness is the 2nd most neglected area that I see businesses avoid.  They think the thing they sell, should sell itself.\n\n3. Delivery.  Building a product/service/system that around that offer.  Most businesses put almost all effort into this area and think that it is the Offer and since it is the Offer that word-of-mouth is the Awareness.  They think the thing they sell, should sell itself.  That's incorrect.\n\n1. Offer - Identify the problem and favorite customer.  Test the idea, before building if you can.\n\n2. Delivery - Build the thing that solves the problem.\n\n3. Offer - Create a USP.\n\n4. Awareness - Promote, promote, promote.\n\n  \nHope that helps.",

I don't know if the the companies hire someone to bot reports or do the reporting themselves but the approach is the same: a ridiculous number of reports on old posts trying to trigger automatic removals.\n\nThat doesn't work here because we actually look at the posts that get reported. Reporting something that doesn't break our rules but makes you look bad isn't going to cause it to be removed.\n\nIf you as a subscriber have questions about these companies I'd suggest you search the sub to learn about them. If the posts are gone then someone has bullied the original posters into removing them. If you are an OP on one of these I encourage you to hold your ground on anything truthful you have posted. I'll stand with you and defend your right to post.\n\nIf you represent one of these companies you'd be well served by finding and stopping any company doing fake reporting on your behalf. If you'd like to discuss legal action you should know that Reddit legal is VERY familiar with posting law and any truthful post not made with malevolent intent is likely safe under US law. You can discuss it with them at length if you like paying your lawyers.\n\nTo everyone, thanks for reporting content that breaks our rules. We're in a long war against spam, fake content, AI slop, and abuse and your help in it is vital.

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nMy wife and I started a small residential cleaning business about six months ago. We’ve done everything we thought we needed to build a real company — and yet, we haven’t had a single paying client so far.\n\nHere’s what we’ve done so far:\n\t•\tFully registered the business legally with insurance and all licenses.\n\t•\tRented a tiny, low-cost office with direct access for equipment and supplies.\n\t•\tSet up a phone line and an online booking system for customers to schedule cleanings.\n\t•\tEven built an AI chatbot to answer questions and help people get quotes automatically.\n\t•\tDesigned the whole brand around eco-friendly, non-toxic cleaning — something we really believe in.\n\t•\tRan ads on Facebook and Google for months, testing headlines, visuals, and audiences. Still zero traction.\n\nAt this point, we’re trying to figure out what’s going wrong — whether it’s our offer, our marketing, or something deeper in how we’re presenting ourselves.\n\nSo I’d really appreciate your honest feedback:\n👉 What would you do differently to get clients for a local service business like this?\n👉 Are there marketing channels that actually work for local service companies?\n👉 When you visit a business website, what makes you trust it enough to book — and what makes you leave?\n\nWe even built a full website and booking system with an AI chatbot — I can share the link if anyone’s open to taking a look and giving feedback.\n\nWe’d really appreciate any advice, insights, or even brutal honesty. At this point, we just want to understand what we’re doing wrong before giving up.\n\nThanks for reading — and for any help you can offer.\n\n– Two tired (but still hopeful) small business owners.\n\nHonestly, I didn’t expect this much support from so many people. We’re truly grateful for the time everyone has spent replying and giving feedback.\n\nMany of the points mentioned are already being worked on , we’ve started making several changes, and we know it’s time to get out there, meet people, and connect face to face. The technical part is done; now comes the most important part , showing up as real people and selling ourselves.\n\nI’ll keep this post updated with how things are going in case anyone’s interested in following along as we make these changes.",

You are coming into people’s homes and they are trusting you with a lot, reviews are 95% of the battle.

          "body": "I started my cleaning business the old-fashioned way, through Gumtree adverts. That completely changed things for me. I didn’t have a website or chatbot back then, just a clear advert with my cleaning areas, services, and fair starting rates. Within weeks, I got my first few clients, and from there word of mouth took over. That’s really how I built momentum.\n\nSometimes it’s not about how professional or automated your setup looks, it’s about being visible where your target clients actually are. Cleaning is a trust-based business. Most people want to hire someone they’ve either met, seen recommended, or been referred to.\n\nHere’s what helped me and what I’d recommend:\n\n1. Advertise locally.\nPost on Gumtree, Facebook Marketplace, and Nextdoor. Keep your message simple and friendly. List your area, what kinds of cleans you offer (regular, deep, end of tenancy, etc.), and your starting rate. People don’t always want to fill long booking forms — they just want someone who can come soon and do a good job.\n\n\n2. Join cleaning groups.\nFacebook cleaning business groups and cleaner referral groups are gold. Try ones like Professional Cleaners UK, Cleaning Business Owners Network, or your local “Cleaners in [your city]” group. You’ll get tips, referrals, and sometimes subcontract work when other cleaners are overbooked.\n\n\n3. Be bold with offers.\nIf you can afford it, offer an introductory discount , for example:\n\n&gt; “First 5 clients get a 2.5-hour basic clean at cost price.”\nIt gives people a reason to try you and helps you build reviews, photos, and trust.\n\n\n\n4. Build local relationships.\nI made a point of getting friendly with concierge staff in apartment buildings. That alone opened a lot of doors because they often know who’s moving in or out and can recommend cleaners on the spot. Drop them your card or a flyer, and thank them if they send someone your way.\n\n\n5. Collect reviews and photos.\nAfter every clean, politely ask clients if you can take a before-and-after photo and if they’d mind leaving a short Google review. That builds your credibility fast.\n\n\n6. Stay active on your Google Business Profile.\nUpdate photos, respond to reviews, and post occasionally. Even one or two good reviews can make a huge difference when people search “cleaner near me.”\n\n\n\nYou’ve done the hardest part already, setting up the structure. Now it’s about visibility, networking, and trust. Once you get your first few jobs and people see your results, it snowballs.",

Frankly, so did I and so do many of us and it's very correctable.\n\nThe core issue is you expanded business overhead (added costs) before having the revenue to pay for it (paying clients). I imagine you did this thinking an office, website, and social presence were necessary for getting work - that when someone was looking for a cleaning company they would want to see a level of professionalism and, well, success! But that is not how clients measure most service industries.\n\nIf I asked you what the most important factor is in hiring painters to paint your bedroom a different color, you would probably say \"doing the job right and without issue\". Does this relate to their office or their website experience? You likely see the error at this point.\n\nSo brass tacks, this is a list of things you can do to get your business up and running: (1) Get business cards, (2) Go to referral groups (google these) and hand out cards, (3) find your local chamber of commerce and go to their mixers and hand out cards, (4) ask your family or friends if you can do a cleaning for them for free to get some before and after pictures, (5) post said pictures online, (6) ask family and friends to leave google reviews for you, (7) consider terminating your office lease until you have so much business going on that you MUST have an office with dedicated staff, (8) post cleaning memes (yes, really - don't take yourself seriously).\n\nWhat you should expect is to get alot of \"interest\" initially but few inbound phone calls or emails. Focus on meeting people, giving them a reason to try your service, and maintaining that relationship. Over the next 90 days, I would expect that you begin to collect a modest group of repeat customers.",

Cleaning services are likely one of the first things people stop using when trying to save money. This doesn't mean it's impossible to be successful, just something to keep in mind as you're starting out. If you can make it through an economic downturn you'll be golden on the other side. \n\nAs a consumer I HATE AI chat bots when I have questions. I'd rather see everything clear up front on your website and be able to talk to a person if I have questions. \n\nGetting your first clients is the hardest.\n\nConsider reaching out to local businesses and see if they need cleaning services.

There must be at least two people to cover accounting and all aspects of operations. But there must be one boss. \n\n\nIn my opinion, accounting is God, but operations needs to understand that any sneeze that impacts the GL must be thought through. Ops people don’t get that. In fairness, accounting people don’t get ops. \n\nHR and CRM stuff can come later but those modules are really like cake decorations and perhaps better handled with outside systems and integrated into NS. \n\nYour CFO isn’t wrong, but there are a hundred things you should do before you engage with NetSuite. \n\nAsk AI to create a list of everything you should do before you make that discovery call. \n\nAmong them should be readable spreadsheets the NS engineers can decipher because you’re gonna want custom searches and reports setup to match the spreadsheet purgatory you created and wish to escape. \n\nNS will not really walk you through it. They assume you get them, they don’t truly need to get you, and you burn up all your support hours finding that out as they constantly switch their own internal support teams and leads around. \n\nHave only one leader to be 100% devoted to NetSuite and NOTHING ELSE. Not the CFO for goodness sake.

They all claim to have the exact, niche experience I need.  If I ask them any questions regarding something technical, they give the correct answers...\n\nSo, I’ve made a new, 100% non-negotiable rule: A brief video call. No exceptions.\n\nA quick video call will give me a lot of info about the potential hire... \n\n1. It weeds out the fakes. The person sending flawless, scripted messages almost *always* crumbles when I ask them a basic question in real-time.\n\n2. It's a \"vibe check\" for cultural fit. My brand has a very specific audience. I need someone who gets the \"swag\" and lingo. I can tell in 60 seconds of a live conversation if they *genuinely* get it or if they just studied a script.\n\n3. It verifies their professional setup. You would be shocked at how many people I've gotten on a call who are trying to do their job from a phone. So if I am paying an hourly rate, I cant afford an inefficient setup.\n\n4. It verifies their tech. If the video call is choppy and they tell me they're \"on 4G,\" and I ask them if they can connect to an actual wifi or ethernet lan, and they tell me they don't have that... Red Flag...\n\nIt's a huge change from how I hired back in 2005, but it's the only way I can find real, professional talent.\n\nSo, is it just me? Or have you all had to do this too? What other methods are you using to filter candidates these days?",

      "selftext": "I’m not a fancy or high-maintenance woman, but I really appreciate when a man has his life and space in order. I feel like there are so many incredible men out there who just need a little guidance with style and environment.\nA lot of guys spend money on dating or communication coaching, but then when a woman actually comes over, the space feels off. The lighting’s harsh or too bright, there’s no music, maybe it smells a little stale or feels cold (literally and emotionally). It’s not that they don’t care, it’s just that no one’s ever taught them how to make a home feel safe and inviting.\nSo I’m thinking of creating a course or guide that teaches men how to transform their space on a budget for under $250 using simple sensory design: lighting, scent, warmth, music, and personal touches.\nI’m also a licensed massage therapist, so I could include a section on the basics of slow, safe, intentional touch to help men understand the connection between physical environment and emotional comfort.\nDoes this sound like something people would actually pay for or be interested in? Any thoughts on how to structure it as a course, digital guide, or coaching?\n",

Then using the \"guys with bad apartments\" angle just for funny/friendly PSA's on social media/posters/etc, you might actually get some hits for people. I think $250 will be a tall order for budget conscious people though unless you actually spend a lot of time setting their place up. Design in general is a tricky space that's hard to do on a budget. A lot of people with small budgets are not willing or capable of valuing your insights. The people who would value your insights tend to be willing to pay thousands for it, but they'll also expect a high level of execution and be coming at you from a much more challenging problem to solve (going from a place that is decent to one that truly sings).\n\nI do like the idea of in general, a PSA existing to help guys be better?

Make it a $1000+ consultation where you go on site, take inventory of everything that can be addressed, and then follow up with a customized plan of action - easy to do's, links to things to purchase, etc, etc.  You're almost becoming an interior designer in this scenario, just with a niche.\n\nNow you're targeting single men with more disposable income, which are the very people who also tend to know other single men with disposable income.

Instead of doing it for them, help them to find their own way.\n\nRest of my post is just some rambling.\n\nI think men can use a service for decorating etc just like women use handymans to fix things technical in the house.\n\nI'm surprised though that women expect men to do literally everything themselves. A man can't be everything. This is usually something that women bring to the table. The female touch.\n\nIt's strange that women don't take up the task. I had women offer to give my house a makeover.\n\nWhether it's possible to convince the man that needs this service to spend money on will be a challenge. Their house is cold for the exact reason that they simply don't see it or they see it but not as a big problem. So they might welcome a solution. But they don't value it appropriately.\n\nI know women that have really nice houses. Cozy, bold, even though they themselves say it's a mess I can see that it's her mind that has shaped it with all the choices she made over the years in what she will and will not have in her house. It reflects her personality. It's an art form.\n\nIn that way it will be a risk for a man to hire a service to do this. Since when it's a women she will bring her personality into his space.  He will end up with a interior that is thoughtful but not necessarily bespoke to him.\n\nWhen we then have his dates visit his house they will recognize the work but they will also instantly know that it's not his interior but simply bought as a prop.\n\nSo making a course is way better then to take everything out of his hands.\n\nI think you should partner with other women who like different styles, have them present moodbooks etc so clients can choose in directions they like.\n\nYou could make it in an app. Maybe start by swiping to pinpoint what directions are best first and then expand. You have to present it in a way men like.\n\nOh and since men will be hard to convince to spend money on it, why not make giftcards so women or anyone can give it as a present. Then you get your pay and it's paid for by the women / acquintances who do see the value of your service.",

Being in the field of IT and having already some clients through referrals would be enough to kick off with marketing.\n\nUsually you would have 3 options. Hire a freelancer, hire in-house or hire with a marketing company/agency.\n\nHiring freelancer might be the most economical, but need to be careful, lots of people in freelancing might promise but under-deliver for what you've paid. But once you find a great one with honest work, it will be great asset for the business. Just heads up with the professionals. Always ask for referrals and previous work. \n\nHiring in-house is ratherly expensive these days and also there is the process of hiring. But you have the option to choose a great experienced marketer which could pay itself off. The only issue with this is really the cost to the business.\n\nHiring a company/agency might feel a little better but there's a similar issue to the freelancers which is over-promising but under-delivering, only under a contract. I would say hiring a company is the riskiest because of the contracts. But if you work with a company that's great at their jobs and at least can provide a fine ROI, they will be reliable partner. Cost is more than freelancer but usually less than in-house but it has an advantage because you hire a whole team.\n\n\nThere is also a +1 option which is to learn yourself, but as you've said, it's time consuming and even more time consuming to master it. But once you've master it, there are no additional costs you would have to pay. \n\nI just wanted to point out the important details during your search. As long as you don't fall for false promises you're all good. Important to always keep in mind \"no one can promise or guarantee results in the field of marketing\"\n\nIf you would like to, we can just discuss further. Not trying to pitch myself, but I can share some of expertise if you don't know the market at all.",

You need to focus on one niche - the websites or the IT stuff. If you want to do both, spin off the web design stuff as a DBA and make a new brand for just that and keep the IT brand seperate. \n\nThen, you need your google business profiles for each one, with lots of reviews. Then you need your location pages for your different services and locations like “cyber security experts in Rockford, IL” and Chicago, and Naperville, and oak park.  A home page can’t rank for every service and every location. You make pages specific for each one so they have a better shot at ranking and being found. \n\nThen there’s blogging. You need to write a blog answering the most commonly searched questions related to your work. Use a service like this \n\nhttps://answerthepublic.com\n\nAnd find a topic to write about. This will bring visitors to the site and add more content and authority in Google’s eyes. A good blog answers questions. \n\nNext is get off fiver. Full of low quality leads that are bottom of the barrel on pricing. They don’t value your skills. They value paying as little as possible. Not great clients. \n\nChicago is a tough market because it’s competitive. Ranking won’t be easy. And you might need to hire an SEO guy.

It's the equivalent of putting up a quick and dirty billboard made with microsoft word\n\nYour kind of work is not about big picture marketing, you just need to pay for search ads and those ads need to lead to an attractive landing page that is good at generating leads. Yes technically this is marketing but you don't need to be hitting up social media or paying for TV ads or anything like that.\n\nOnce you have a good looking functional website with good SEO and a well done landing page for your paid ads, it's basically set and forget. This admittedly is a whole can of worms to learn in of itself but seeing as you make websites already half the battle you can do yourself. It is worthwhile effort to learn effort if you're at all good with research and happen to have the time (because its slow). Alternatively you can outsource this to a google ads/SEO manager, which can be worth it. I'd find someone reputable local to do help you if you decide you have the budget to do it vs doing it yourself because ads/SEO people are a minefield of wannabes, scammers, and fake results. Maybe you can reach out to one of your current/past clients who seem to have a good ad/web presence and ask who they use?\n\nExpect to spend something like 10-15% on revenue on ads + management of them by the way if you want good results. It's worth it. We went through a slump at the beginning of this year and started spinning ads up for the first time. It's been a learning process but its absolutely paid for itself within the first month. For your industry in particular you could probably benefit from a real SEO guy you pay monthly on contract (again, ask locally), because to really kill it on the SEO front requires posting lots of relevant articles a month to your website involving your field. This signals to google that you're an authority on the subject (plus GPT searches really like that kind of content), and for your type of business coming off as an authority on information relating to what you do is valuable (vs a restaurant or a mill shop where its less useful). At least that's how it was last I checked - the google SEO landscape changes all the damn time so maybe posting frequent articles isn't so hot right now. But yeah - a good SEO guy will completely take care of all of that for you. \n\nAlso it should be said - focus on local. Go to business networking meetups, find other businesses and be seen in person. Get coffee/lunch dates with people you want to connect with. This builds healthy foundations and relationships for your business which are the real secret to success.",

          "body": "14 hours a month sounds pretty reasonable for an 18 month old Saas especially if you're chasing invoices and dealing with bookkeeper back and forth. You're not being slow.\n\n  \nThe annoying truth is that most of those hours are probably spent on a mix of things - some you can automate and some you can't. Invoice chasing is just a reality of b2b unfortunately. Timesheets and invoicing workflows depend a lot on your specific setup.\n\nThe receipts and expense tracking side got way easier for us when we switched to Ramp - that cut down on a chunk of the bookkeeper questions and manual reconciliation stuff. \n\nAt 40k MRR you're probably right that a full time finance person is premature, but you might be at the point where a part time bookkeeper who does more than just answer your questions could take some of this off your plate. Or even a VA for invoice follow ups. The goal isn't to get to 0 hours (impossible) but getting it under 5 to 7 hours seems doable with the right automation + delegation.\n\n  \nHope it helped :)",

      "selftext": "I know this might sound a little out of place in a group about business ownership, but I’ve found myself in a pretty strange situation and could really use some perspective.\n\nFor context, I’ve worked in SEO for several years now, across a few different agencies. Over time, I noticed a huge gap in how most agencies handle local SEO, especially when it comes to ranking Google Business Profiles. So I decided to start my own business that focuses solely on that, helping businesses dominate local search and maybe even partnering with agencies down the road.\n\nNow here’s where things get tricky. When I first started this business, my boss (who’s honestly a great guy) let me test out my strategies on a few of his clients so I could build a portfolio. That was incredibly generous of him. I know most bosses would never allow that. My strategies ended up working way better than expected, and since then, I’ve shifted my focus to my own clients instead of his.\n\nLately though, my boss has been nudging me to start doing that same local SEO work again for his clients. It started small, like, “Hey, I didn’t see that local SEO stuff on our reports lately,” or “Let’s try some of that stuff you did before on this client.” I’ve helped where I can, but it’s starting to feel like I’m getting pulled back into something that blurs the line between my job and my business.\n\nThe problem is, this is my strategy, something I built from scratch, and I’ve turned it into a service I now offer independently. But at the same time, I do feel like I owe him a lot for supporting me early on. If I were to suggest partnering up or offering it as a white-label service, I’m worried he might take it the wrong way, like, “Well, I already pay you for SEO, so just do it during your hours.”\n\nI don’t want to ruin the relationship, he’s been good to me, but I also don’t want my business to be held hostage. I know what I’ve created has serious value, and clearly he sees it too. So yeah, I’m feeling a bit stuck and not sure how to handle this without burning a bridge. Any advice?",

I was located on a busy street in a funky, popular downtown area in a college town.

          "body": "The secret to success in a paper/stationery store today is creating an experience and community that online retailers can’t replicate, while being strategic about your product mix.\n\nHere are the key elements:\nFind your niche identity. Don’t try to compete with Amazon on basic office supplies. Instead, become the destination for something specific: beautiful Japanese stationery, bullet journaling supplies, luxury fountain pens, eco-friendly products, or locally-designed goods. People will travel and pay premium prices for specialty items they can touch and test.\n\nMake it tactile and experiential. Your biggest advantage is that customers can feel paper weights, test pens, see colors in person, and discover products they didn’t know existed. Create testing stations, offer workshops on calligraphy or bookbinding, host journaling meetups. The store should be a place people want to spend time, not just transact.\n\nBuild community. Stationery enthusiasts are passionate and congregate online, but crave real-world connection. Become a hub for local artists, students, planners, and writers. Host events, feature local creators, maintain a social media presence that celebrates your customers’ creativity.\n\nCurate thoughtfully. Stock what big boxes don’t: independent brands, imports, artist collaborations, and products with stories. People shopping small want to feel they’re discovering something special.\nDiversify revenue. Add services like custom printing, monogramming, gift wrapping, or even a small café corner. Consider subscription boxes or strong online/local delivery to supplement foot traffic.\n\nThe stores thriving now are destinations with personality, not just retail spaces. With this in mind, you can add a complimentary business within the space.\n\nA complementary business can drive foot traffic, increase average transaction value, and make your space a destination. Here are some winning combinations:\n\nCoffee/Tea Bar - This is probably the most natural pairing. People browse stationery, then sit with a latte to journal or write cards. It encourages lingering, creates ambiance, and the profit margins on beverages are excellent. You could even theme drinks around products (“The Moleskine Mocha”).\n\nPrint/Copy Services - Custom printing, business cards, invitations, zine printing. You already have paper-loving customers; offer them services too. Wedding invitation consultations can be particularly lucrative.\n\nGift Wrapping Station - Not just supplies but a premium wrapping service. During holidays this could be a significant revenue stream, and it positions your store as a gifting destination.\n\nBookstore/Book Section - Small press books, local authors, beautiful editions, journals and planners. The customer overlap is nearly perfect, and it extends browsing time.\n\nArt Supplies Corner - Watercolors, brush pens, sketchbooks. Many stationery lovers also draw or do hand-lettering.\n\nVinyl/Record Selection - Sounds random, but hear me out: both attract collectors who appreciate physical media and craftsmanship. Creates an interesting vibe and crossover appeal.\n\nWorkshop/Event Space - Rent it out for small meetings, creative workshops, book clubs. Generates income during off-hours and builds community.\n\nThe best choice depends on your interests (you’ll be managing it!), your local market gaps, and your space constraints. What draws you? Or what’s missing in your area?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

I don't even use the website of the art shop I used to go to, because amazon will get things to me tomorrow, and that's what you're up against.\n\nI think you could really embrace the local community with same day local delivery or similar? Click and collect style service at a minimum.\n\nIf there's room, then obvious complementary services are renting out spray booths, taking order for  3D printing, CnC machines etc.\n\nAnd as cliche as it sounds, if you can find room for a coffee and cake area, you'll find a lot of people who love art shops also love to spend hours in there - providing sustenance at a profit is a fairly logical move. You'll probably find that it doesn't need to be the final work in high end coffee, just something to keep them going whilst they doodle on a sofa or table.\n\nI would also say if you can turn it into something else of an evening, like push the shelves back and have some poetry nights, or comedy, or small live music, basically turn yourself into a arts hub, not just a shop for pencils during the day.\n\nI'll be honest though, this definitely has vibes of art / stationery being a passion of yours, and you wanting to make a living from it...which is great, but is rarely a recipe for success. You really need to know if there's actually a market for it before you commit to anything else, and if you've not worked retail before, speak to someone who runs their own small store, because it's a huge time and money drain getting stocked and opened, and then the hours can be a real bitch, to be frank.",

Started my greeting card line out of my house in 2013; had an Etsy shop and did lots of pop-ups and markets, and developing my wholesale line before going for it full-time a couple years later.\n\nI’ve had a brick and mortar since 2016. Even in a tourist town and having my own line where the margins are much better, it’s still an uphill battle. I’ve taught workshops and have a good social media presence. I was married, and while his paycheck certainly provided the stability to take risks, I’ve worked really hard to keep this thing afloat.\n\nThe space I was in from 2017-2024 was a giant storefront on Magazine street where we had our letterpress studio in the back, visible for people to see us making the cards. Cool in theory, but not enough to justify the massive overhead. The front half of the store was way too big for what we sold best (cards, pens, stickers, wrapping paper), so I filled it with gifty crap that diluted my brand. Required a big team and lots of capital to keep the inventory stocked. High gross sales, but barely breaking even.\n\nLast year, I moved my print studio to a big, cheap warehouse space, and moved the shop to a tiny jewel box in a fancier part of the neighborhood. Pivoted to custom wedding invitations.\n\nThe business is finally profitable for the first time in years. I’m really proud of myself. There’s no rich husband, just a scrappy gal with a lot of creativity.\n\nGreeting cards are our bread &amp; butter. It’s something people don’t turn to Amazon for, and love the experience of shopping the wall in person on their way to an event— and yes, we can gift wrap that for you too!\n\nOur pen wall is a big focus and it’s so fun seeing people light up at the rainbow of Gelly rolls they can try out. \n\nWe have built an amazing community of regulars and meet new fans of the brand every day. \n\nI don’t have all the answers, I’ve pivoted so many times I’m still dizzy from the COVID years. Just wanted to share my journey in case it helps yours.",

You may need to build up your brand first. \n\nThere’s a CUTE stationary company (very trendy) in California that partnered with Target. They sold their planners, notebooks, and even trendy gift wrap paper in target.  I never knew about their brand before and then started to look for it specifically when I wanted a new planner.\n\nPS- I realize this is a long shot for a new business, but I haven’t seen their product and anything is possible :)",

Do crazy amounts of due diligence. 1) Check all the similar stores within a 50 mile radius and see how they’re doing. 2) If you can talk to the owners, ask them what problems they have encountered. What’s there busy season/slow season. 3) Get a lawn chair, a paperback, and a way to count the people who walk by your proposed location. Do it on the days you think will be busiest, and slowest. 3) Make a real business plan. \n\nRemember your income is the difference between the price you charge and what the item costs you. A $5 pen you sell for $10 grosses you $5. That’s before accounting for rent, light, heat and licenses/taxes. You might be netting $3. Estimate carefully how many people you’d have to serve in a week or a month.\n\nGet lots of advice from people who have done retail. Good luck.",

The advertised rate seemed reasonable, but after signing the contract, I discovered the true cost was closer to $55/hour when you factor in mandatory cleaning fees, storage charges, and equipment usage fees that weren't mentioned upfront.\n\nThis got me thinking - how many other food entrepreneurs get blindsided by these hidden kitchen rental costs? I've talked to other caterers and ghost kitchen operators who've had similar experiences where the advertised rate was 30-50% lower than what they actually ended up paying.\n\nWhat hidden costs have you encountered in your food business operations, and how do you vet potential kitchen spaces to avoid these surprises?",

If you have to, upload it into ChatGPT and prompt it to summarize the contract as if you were a 5-year-old.  Then prompt it to tell you all of the hidden costs and total them.\n\nNow that you have them and understand them, shop for another kitchen space while negotiating the contract terms.  Your business depends on a solid relationship with the lessor…taking the time to go over the details with him/her and finding something that works for both of you can be beneficial.  At the very least, it makes you look like a valuable partner rather than just a lessee.\n\nRemember, though, they got to this point through trial and error to make their business run without a lot of hiccups, and you’re now a hiccup to them by negotiating rather than just accepting the terms.  You have to give something to create value for them, not just take for yourself.\n\nAnd…now that you’ve been in business for a year, try raising your prices by 5% to start making those hidden costs back.  That 5% will bring in new clients and force others to drop off, leaving you with a stronger client base and more revenues.  You’ll also find it easier to attract higher-paying clients and make smarter investments in services that will meet their needs, continuing the virtuous circle.",
