      "selftext": "idk if this is just me but why do clients suddenly develop amnesia the moment money is involved 😭  \nhad this guy hit me up all confident like “yeah bro let’s do it, timeline is tight but budget is ready” (red flag #1 I ignored bc rent)  \nI do the work, send previews, he’s hyped. like FULL CAPS hyped. “THIS IS PERFECT 🔥🔥”  \ncool. I send invoice.  \nabsolute silence. man vanished like I summoned him with a spell that expired.\n\nI follow up after 2 days. nothing. a week later he replies “sorry bro got busy, will sort tomorrow”  \ntomorrow has now been 11 tomorrows. I see him posting stories. I see him active on LinkedIn. I see him commenting on other people’s posts like life is amazing. but my invoice? dead. cold. probably in witness protection.\n\nthe worst part is you start questioning yourself like did I mess up? was it not that good? should I have said something different? but nah… this happens WAY too often to be a coincidence. some people just like the idea of hiring freelancers, not actually paying them.\n\nanyway lesson learned (again): hype doesn’t pay bills, screenshots of “looks great” mean nothing, and if someone says “I’ll pay tomorrow” without a date… just mentally move on and don’t pause your life waiting. back to work I guess 🥲\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nPeaceeee!!!!!!!",

Do a no money down special and outsource it all to mechanicalturk and stack them high like you’re running a digital Costco and then see who pays. If you’re good on the phone and comfortable being somewhat threatening you’ll be wildly profitable.",

I've been a freelancer and made many mistakes too, so not judgment, but yea, this is on you to some extent.\n\nIt sounds like you're not doing proper business practices with briefs, meetings, contracts, upfront payments, watermarks, clear terms, scope &amp; payment conditions etc.\n\nStart taking yourself more professionally, and you'll filter time wasters out immediately. Check out Dann Petty's courses on these topics and level up, and you'll find good clients to work with.\n\nWishing you all the best!",

It’s difficult but if difficulty doesn’t matter, money is there to be made here.\n\n2. Even if you don’t want a career in sales, it’s helpful in your career. Interviews is sales opportunity. Annual performance and salary reviews is sales opportunity.\n\n3. If you ever wanted to build something for yourself, sales is the first skill you will need. Want to start a marketing agency?

It wasn't much but it started a momentum.\n\n  \nSince then I've been on the lookout for these opportunities and now I make around $300-500 per month (I know it's less than what most people on this sub make) through a bunch of inconsistent sources. Data cleanup on Excel, surveys, calendar management for mid sized agencies, and a few other random things here and there.\n\n  \nIt's not regular income and some months are better than others, but I genuinely couldn't have started on this path without that first $10 push from that random post. Once you make that first bit of money online something just shifts in how you see opportunities.\n\n  \nI want to know what was your first source of online income because we all know starting out is the hardest part. After that first payment it becomes so much easier to believe it's possible and keep going.  \nWhat got you started?",

What really changed the game for me recently was discovering how to use AI for specific services like presentation design and product descriptions.\n​It’s much more consistent than random tasks. I followed a 7-day blueprint that taught me how to set up these 'mini-services' without needing technical skills. Made my first sale within a week of following it. Once you see that first payment from a professional service you automated with AI, you never go back to low-pay surveys. For anyone interested, the exact blueprint is linked in my profile!\"",

      "selftext": "Ive officially hit 2k profit from my side hustle.\n\nFelt like sharing the story even though it isnt glamorous.\n\nMy grandpa passed recently and my granma has needed more help around her home, particularly with the yard maintenance.\n\nI realized I actually really enjoy the work, managing the lawn, learning about seeding, what time of year to do certain things etc. \n\nAs I was helping her I needed tools such as a lawn edger or dethatching rake, got myself a decent lawn mower and weed Whacker, some bush trimmers, rake, shovel.\n\nSo, I started helping more elderly people in my community, and some co-workers from my main job.\n\nHonestly its not a ton of money, and its hard work. The most i made was 200$ for 4 hours of work, but i removed multiple 8 foot tall bushes, loaded them in my truck and did dump runs. (+ clean their yard up after)\n\nOh, I also have a truck (required lol)\n\nAll this took was creating a name, a quick description of the work I am capable of completing, and some trusting members of my community.\n\nNow, I need a business license and insurance. Ive opted for just telling people I am not a registered business and I dont have insurance, and most people are happy just to have someone there to help.\n\nSo there it is. The side hustle that I could live off of. Yard care to help my community.\n\nHonestly i love it and wish I could do it full time.\n\n",

Problem is I run everything from home right now and all my utilities are obviously in my personal name not my LLC. My accountant said mixing personal and business addresses can be a headache for taxes too. I reached out to amazon seller support and they basically said without proper business documentation the verification could get rejected. Same thing with tiktok shop, their KYC process is apparently pretty strict about having legit commercial presence. I'm doing about $15k/month right now but want to expand to these bigger platforms. Don't really have the budget or need for actual office space, just need the documentation to pass their verification process.I really dont wanna get my account suspended later because of this since this is my side hustle i let it go to this point.",

But, I'm getting desperate since I just talked to my mom about getting a bank account to start earning money and we got into a huge fight. Before you say work for neighbors, I'm not allowed :/\n\nI really want to be able to start saving to get out of my house. But right now, my biggest concern is gaining at least a little independence through financial means. Even if that means only 100-300 a month.\n\nSo here's the issue: I don't have a SS number. Yes I have one, but I don't have the documents to use it properly. So I can't earn money through a job or any digital currency apps. I've tried the websites like Swagbucks but once winter break is over I won't have hours upon hours to spend playing mindless games or taking surveys that kick me out after five questions.\n\nIs there any way I can still make money? Sorry if this is a dumb question but I really am getting desperate.",

Then the invoice goes out at the end of the month and those little changes are nowhere to be found.  \n  \nPeople I’ve talked to have tried the usual stuff:  \n  \nLeaving a spreadsheet open (and forgetting to update it)  \n  \nUsing full-on time trackers (too much friction for a 3-minute task)  \n  \nTrying to remember everything later (almost always undercounts)  \n  \nOne pattern I’ve noticed is that it’s not about wanting to work for free. It’s that logging tiny tasks has just enough friction that they quietly disappear.  \n  \nThose “quick favors” don’t feel expensive individually, but over time they add up more than most people expect.  \n  \nI’ve seen a few folks experiment with ultra-lightweight ways of logging these moments basically a fast text note the second something changes, dumped into a running list of billable extras. No timers, no categories, no ceremony.  \n  \nWhat’s interesting is how consistently other freelancers recognize the problem when they see it laid out like that. Not excitement, just a kind of “yeah… that’s where my hours go.”  \n  \ni really want to know how others handle this in practice. Do you track every little thing, bundle it into higher rates, ignore it, or just accept some leakage as the cost of staying flexible?",

          "body": "Professional create e-books as another means of monetisation, but it's also wise to know that they don't randomly create e-book of just any topics. They likely identified a specific problem that their community has, or questions that kept surfacing, and they created a product in the form of an e-book to solve that problem. Yes they might have already written about it many times, but they're scattered reading like you mentioned. the value for customers is the curations and the buy-in. when they pay for it vs just reading it for free, they are more likely to take it more seriously and take action to work on it, increasing their chances of seeing a better outcome.\n\nI would say that yes, there's a real demand for such things. It's easy to know which topics hit a nerce - those that go viral of have high engagement. that signals that there's interest in it, and usually what professionals do is to expand on that original post in their books (that's the value add).\n\nWith regards to the challenges, the hardest part is distribution, and audience trust. You need someone to sell it to, and they need to trust that you are the subject matter expert in this field.\n\nAnd there's also the point about copywriting. It's unethical to be using someone else's writing to package into a book for your own sale and benefit.\n\nFlipping this idea around, if you identified a niche that you're interested and knowledgeable in, you can approach this with a research, investigative mindset, where you do deep dives into different professionals in the space, their top suggestions, what they say etc, and leverage off people who are interested in this niche. So you become an aggregator of sorts. You don't lift and use their content, but you leverage on the knowledge that they have shared, and their audience. Share the content, and your findings on a weekly basis - 1 expert per week, and generate revenue via ads. e.g if you send a newsletter, every reader is valuable because they can place ads in your newsletter to monitise. It's abit more work, but it's honest work, and you're actually creating something of value that will also last. which is much better and more valuable than an e-book wrapper.",

One video about lubing stabilizers somehow has 140k views now and keeps getting like 2k views a week still.\n\nI checked my adsense and Ive made around $960 total since January 2025. Its not life changing money but I literally havent touched that channel in 6 years and its just been paying me this whole time. The videos arent even that good, I cringe watching them back but people still find them helpful apparently.\n\nNow Im wondering if I should actually start posting again or just let it ride.

Most passive income source you can get on youtube. If you really like to make these tutorials, just go for it.

      "selftext": "Merry Christmas and Happy Hols Passive Incomers, \n\nA year ago I set out to build what I thought would be a passive income stream app for players, charities and myself ofc. The idea was simple - an ad funded lottery/sweepstakes game where you don't need to spend money to play you just watch ads. The napkin math seemed solid $0.02 per ad view in the US x 5 ads per day x 100k players = $10k in prizes per day and 5% for me would be great… I released the app, made a post in this sub that blew up and so I thought I’d follow up after a year. Aside from reading the story which I’ll dump in the comments, I’d really appreciate if you could try the app and give me some classic honest reddit feedback! It’s been a bit of a side hustle but my main business dried up recently and so I either need to go all in on this, or start something new!\n\n[**https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=earn.cash.with.ad.millionaire.maker.lottery.bet**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=earn.cash.with.ad.millionaire.maker.lottery.bet)\n\n**Emojingo on Google Play (classic app)**\n\n[**https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=task.emojingo.app&amp;hl=en\\_US**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=task.emojingo.app&amp;hl=en_US)\n\n**Emojingo Tasks on Google Play (higher earnings per ad view in some countries)**\n\n[**https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emojingo-live-play-the-world/id6738431720**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emojingo-live-play-the-world/id6738431720)\n\n**Emojingo on iOS (can’t cashout via app - need to use web dashboard on emojingo.com)**\n\nHere are the Emojingo basics - each advert you watch (5-30s) adds money to the prize pool and generates a ticket for the daily prize draw that I do in TikTok Live [https://www.tiktok.com/@playemojingo](https://www.tiktok.com/@playemojingo) I then take all the money from the ad views and add it to the prize pool (minus 5% for charity and 5% for me) which I then split with the players every day. Any money that is not won, gets rolled over to the next day so we can get a range of big prizes with lower chance of winning and some smaller daily prizes.  \n  \n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/passive\\_income/comments/1gprs9k/made\\_an\\_ad\\_funded\\_lotterysweepstakes\\_app\\_emojingo/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/comments/1gprs9k/made_an_ad_funded_lotterysweepstakes_app_emojingo/)\n\n**The OG post**  \n  \nI’ll dump the rest of the story in the comments",

          "body": "  \nHere’s the TLDR part:\n\n\n\nI got around 10k players immediately after launch and then got hacked right away - built the first app on the client only, thinking that we could move to server if it took. Moral, if you’re doing anything involving rewards or paying money to people, build it robustly with a server even for the MVP.  \n  \nI started building the user base slowly, thinking everything was covered, but some crafty hackers found the one endpoint that we didn’t lock and started exploiting it very gently so I didn’t notice at first but after a while as I couldn’t figure out why the numbers didn’t add up, I tracked him down. Turns out they had a group somewhere and so a couple of hundred people were using this exploit. When we shut them down, they went and collectively dropped a bunch of 1\\* reviews saying we were a scam and Google took down our app. No appeals helped. Moral, robust server, again  \n  \nWe restarted the app, but this time decided to add Earn into the app title because it performed and into the package name. When we started again, we noticed that our ad rates dropped, spend weeks figuring out why, until finally some random Good Samaritan at an ad network told us that Earn is a trigger warning for ad networks and they’ll either outright ban you or dump your rates. Moral, if you’re incentivising ad views in your app, be careful about it and don’t rub it into the ad networks’ face. \n\n\n\nRight around that time, I experimented with screenshots and used another app’s screenshots as inspiration for Gemini to make something similar - it left a small non-copyrighted bit in, but that was enough for another removal. Moral, be careful if you’re recreating screenshots to make sure nothing gets stuck there.  \n  \nWe somehow managed to get out of that one and the app was reinstated, but then our TikTok randomly got banned and then reinstated. People in the know said that our positioning was very lottery like, even though we don’t take any money and it’s pure ads. Moral, TikTok is super sensitive around gambling so be very careful there. Instagram doesn’t really have our target audience but YouTube is good and I suspect Facebook too. ",

You’ve already established that you make as much as your regular job per hour when you’re actively working and building your income stream but what you’re not accounting for is the fact that ‘some’ of that income is passive.\n\nIf you do nothing at all next month you’ll make $100 (ad revenue minus costs).  This is free money and while it’s not forever you could earn it for a long time and although you’re still small you’ve created a saleable asset.  I’m not up to date on what a YouTube channel sells for so someone else feel free to correct me but your channel is worth something like $3,000-$8,000.  \n\nNow if you add that into your hourly wages I bet you see things start to rocket and snowball getting your wages up into the XXX per hour range.  The best part is that you can compound, I don’t know what your growth rate is currently but you have one client now, what’s stopping you from having three by the end of the year?  Let’s grow that ad revenue 10% a month and get you to $500 a month by next year!  \n\nWhat happens when you get to 50k subscribers and you can easily add in another sponsorship stream and double or triple your income because of that added revenue.\n\nYou’re already making more than you would at your day job which is the biggest hurdle to overcome, now it’s smooth sailing to compound that growth.

This is how it would look online.”\n\nWhen people see a finished product, the chance of buying goes way up.\n\nCharge small at first:\n$50–$100 per site\n3–6 clients = $300–$600\n\nKeep doing it, improve your approach, refine the sites, and scale toward $1000.\n\nWill it work every time?

Virtual assistant work is probably fastest since it's mostly scheduling and emails. Watch YouTube tutorials, practice for a few days, then make a Fiverr/upwork profile. Charge low at first just to get reviews.\n\nGrind Fiverr proposals and take whatever gigs you can get. Even if it's $20-30 per gig, do 5-6 of those and you're at $100-150. Combined with survey apps getting you another $50-80, you're around $200.\n\nTo hit $300 you'd need to either land one bigger freelancing gig or sell stuff you own.

I use Swagbucks and Babki which has both surveys and games. Not exciting but it's baseline income.\n\nSell stuff you don't need on Facebook Marketplace or OfferUp. Even $20-30 from that plus the apps gets you closer. For steadier income, look into remote data entry on Clickworker or Appen. The pay isn't great but it's more reliable than apps. If you have any skills at all, even basic ones, post on r//slavelabour offering services. People pay $5-20 for quick tasks.\n\nThe $100 mark is realistic if you combine multiple small income sources instead of trying to find one thing that pays $100 alone.",

Also growing herbs. My best friend grows herbs and has a raspberry bush and she makes 40$ a month selling bundles of freshly grown herbs to local people. The raspberries she makes preserves from in the summer and sells the jam throughout the year. Also selling baked goods is a good way to make a few bucks. \n\nI would also recommend courses on websites like Alison.com and EdX.org. They have courses you can take for free to learn new skills, you only have to pay for a degree or certificate at the end. But even if you don’t buy the certificate or degree, you will still have the skills you learned you just won’t have certification for them. Also, it’s worth asking local places if they will pay you a few bucks for doing tedious work other people don’t want to do such as washing windows and trim, weeding gardens and yards, sweeping the sidewalk, walking pets, or detailing cars and bicycles. \n\nAs someone who grew up very poor, the most important thing is to be resourceful and think outside the box.

There is no such thing as 100% passivity but rather a sliding scale with a tradeoff of energy &amp; returns. If somebody puts say an hour a week into something then it’s absolutely reasonable to consider it to be passive. An author who writes ebooks once and collects royalties for years is still generating mostly passive income, a guy who works one afternoon a week restocking vending machines is still mostly generating passive income, etc. \n\n\nYou are right that you need significant amounts to generate returns with virtually no risk or effort but plenty of people choose a different position in the risk/effort/capital/reward matrix and that’s ok.",

I thought carefully about the skills I have, even though there aren’t many haha: drawing and digital art, understanding what my target customers want, and decent SEO. I haven’t been able to spend a lot of time on these little shops, but I’ve already listed about 60 products, and for the past four months, I’ve been making an extra 200 dollars each month. \n\nI really enjoy this work. It’s not completely passive income, but it feels pretty close. My products are all digital downloads, like digital stationery, planners, stickers, and so on. I draw some simple designs on my iPad and then use Canva to put everything together. I use AdsPower to manage my shops separately. The income isn’t huge yet, but it’s enough to cover my bills, and I’m already super excited. I just need to put in a bit more time. I really think that as long as you find the right approach, even a competitive niche can work out. \n\nSorry I didn’t share my shop! There are plenty of videos on YouTube about selling digital products. Just find what works for you. \n\n",

Everything I found was either buggy or way too expensive for what I needed (most “affordable” tools are still $20–$50/month for basic stuff). So I said screw it, built my own version in a day, and shared it.​\n\nPeople started calling it “the most affordable feedback tool on the internet”. Someone paid, then another… and now there are 9 paying users at a very dumb, very simple price: **1$/month per site**. So right now it’s literally 9 users → 9$/month.\n\nWhat feels crazy to me is not the money, but the timing. TrustMRR stats show that going from 0 → first dollar usually takes around 5 months on average, and I hit that “0 to 1” in a day with a side project.​\n\nA few things this taught me already:\n\n* Scratching your own itch is still underrated.\n* Charging *something* beats waiting for “the perfect launch”.\n* Simple pricing lowers the mental barrier for both builder and buyer.\n\nHappy to answer any questions about how the 9 users came in, pricing, stack, etc.",

Most people will tell you to do surveys or micro-tasks for $10/day, but that’s just trading your life for pocket change.\n\nI’m currently on Day 24 of a $0 to $10k/month challenge using pure organic traffic (no ads). Here is what I’ve learned about the '$10/day' mindset:\n\n1. **Don't 'Work' for $10, Build for it:** If you spend 2 hours a day on a survey, you get $10 once. If you spend 2 hours building a Pinterest or Reddit presence, that content stays online and works for you 24/7.\n2. **The 'Leaky Bucket' Problem:** I just discovered I was 'leaking' traffic. I had 105 clicks to offers but $0 revenue because I wasn't capturing emails first. $10/day comes easily once you fix your 'routing.'\n3. **Start with Value:** Pick a niche you know, post helpful data on Reddit or Quora, and link to a resource.\n\nI’m documenting every failure and pivot of my 90-day build-in-public journey on my profile. It’s currently at $0, but the 'plumbing' is now doing 18k views. Happy to show you the 'architecture' if you want to see how to aim higher than $10!",

      "selftext": "Passive income is earnings from sources requiring little to no ongoing effort after initial setup, often from assets you own (e.g., investments generating returns without daily work).\n\nExamples:\n\n• Vending machine profits – Buy and place machines; restock occasionally or outsource; collect ongoing cash.\n\n•  Stock dividends: Invest money upfront in dividend-paying stocks or funds; earn regular payouts automatically with minimal maintenance. (Passive: money works for you.)\n\n• Rental property income (with property manager): Buy property, hire management; collect rent checks ongoing. (Passive after setup.)\n\n• Royalties from a book/ebook – Write and publish once (e.g., on Amazon KDP); earn royalties on every sale forever.\n\n• Online course sales – Create and upload a course once (e.g., on Udemy or Teachable); earn from enrollments with no further work\n\n• Affiliate marketing website/blog – Build a site with evergreen content and affiliate links; earn commissions from traffic/sales over years.\n\n• YouTube channel ad revenue – Upload videos that stay relevant; earn from ads, sponsorships, and views long-term (after hitting monetization).\n• Peer-to-peer lending interest – Lend money via platforms like LendingClub; earn interest automatically as borrowers repay.\n\n• App or software license sales – Develop an app once and sell/distribute it (e.g., on app stores); earn from downloads/subscriptions.\n\n• Digital product sales (printables, stock photos, templates) – Create once and sell unlimited copies on Etsy or your site.\n• High-yield savings or CD interest – Deposit money in interest-bearing accounts; earn passively with zero effort.\n• Domain name parking/flipping – Buy valuable domains and park them with ads or sell later for profit.\n\nClicking vague links from sketchy folks phishing for morons here 24/7 will NOT lead you to success in passive income. \n",

You just tap once every 24 hours to mine(no deposits needed ) it starts off slow, but I usually make around $100 month just by being consistent and inviting people helps boost your mining rate too . I usually bet my bonus sats on the app with mlb or basket/nfl for withdraw the satoshis. You can download game and doing task for sats ( those are withdrawable directly) . No requires any money or deposits thats the things that i liked with it lol.  If you want a bonus you can use my code MNG-FIJI-RQS.\n\nYou aslo have attapoll where you can do survey and minimum withdrawal its 2.50$ . My refferal code for it is KPVZZ !",

Payouts from platforms, random brand payments, subscriptions, tips, refunds, all coming in at different times. Some banks seem fine until they suddenly aren’t. I’m less interested in what’s “the best” on paper and more in what people are actually using day to day right now. What’s been smooth, what caused headaches, what you switched away from and why.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing, what’s your current setup and does it actually feel manageable or just tolerable?",

Then payouts started trickling in. Nothing life-changing, but I’m a couple hundred dollars in now, just from people using the voice, and I haven’t touched it since the initial setup.\n\nWhat surprised me most was how front-loaded the work is. Record clean samples, follow the guidelines, upload, and then it just… sits there. Obviously not everyone’s voice will be in demand, but it feels similar to stock photos or music licensing, just with your voice and AI.\n\nI’m curious if anyone else here has tried voice licensing or other AI-adjacent passive income plays like this. And if anyone wants details on how I learned the process, feel free to comment interest in the inbox not sure mods would be cool with links in the comments.\n\nWould love to hear if others are experimenting with this space or think it’s just a short-term thing.",

You already understand shipping workflows, which is a big advantage. Check Upwork / Fiverr but position yourself as operations support, not “VA.”\n* Local service arbitrage:Dubai has high demand for cleaning, moving, handyman, car detailing, etc. You don’t do the work — you just: run ads, handle WhatsApp inquiries, book jobs, take a margin, Very doable evenings/weekends.\n* B2B outreach for small companies:Many SMEs here are terrible at email/LinkedIn outreach. Learning basic cold email + lead lists can turn into a retainer side income within a few months.\n* Longer-term (not passive at first): digital products or contentIf your goal is “something of your own,” build in public slowly (blog, X, Reddit) around a niche you actually know (shipping, expat life, ops, logistics). Monetization comes later.\nBiggest advice: Avoid anything marketed as “passive” upfront. Almost nothing is. Focus on skills or leverage first, then make it passive later.",

My personal goal is consistent monthly income plus an emergency buffer but part of me wonders if you ever truly feel ready.\n\nFor those who actually made the leap what flipped the switch for you?  \nWas it hitting a number seeing a trend you trusted or realizing staying in your job felt worse than the risk of leaving? And looking back what do you wish you had known before going full time?",

In the following lesson, both the teacher and the student apologized to each other, each believing the fault was their own.\n\n\n\nDespite this, LingoAce still fined the teacher USD $16 for the missed class.\n\n\n\nWhen my friend raised a complaint and explained that:\n\n\n\nthe LingoAce system could not be accessed\n\n\n\nthe student was affected as well\n\n\n\nthe issue was technical and outside his control\n\n\n\nThe fine was not reversed. Shortly afterward, his teaching hours were reduced.\n\n\n\nThis situation highlights ongoing concerns that:\n\n\n\nteachers are penalized for technical failures they cannot control\n\n\n\nplatform issues are treated as teacher faults\n\n\n\nraising legitimate complaints may lead to reduced hours rather than resolution\n\n\n\nI’m sharing this to document another real example of how technical issues, fines, and complaints are currently handled.",

Also tailwinds communities feature exposed my pins to thousands more people organically.\n\nSmartpin feature generates multiple design variations automatically which saves insane amounts of time vs designing everything from scratch in canva. I compared pins made with smartpin vs canva and tbh they performed about the same so now I mostly use smartpin cause its way faster.\n\nThings that surprised me: pinterest traffic converts better than google traffic for affiliate offers, people are already in research/buying mode. Comparison posts (Product A vs Product B) get 2x more saves than generic roundup posts. Vertical pins crush square pins, not even close.\n\nChallenges: Takes 4-6 weeks to see real momentum so don't expect instant results. Pinterest algorithm is inconsistent, some pins randomly go viral and others flop for no clear reason. Tailwind cost adds up but ROI makes it worth it once traffic scales\n\nFocusing on pinterest instead of just SEO was probably the best decision I made for this site, google is so saturated now in most niches anyway.",

We are moving away from the \"signal room\" hype and focusing on data-driven probabilities.\n\nWe’ve decided to skip paid ads (too much noise/high CAC in the trading niche) and go all-in on a \"Nano-Affiliate\" strategy. \n\nWe’re targeting creators with 500–20,000 followers who have high trust.\n\nTo get these small creators to care, I’m offering a 60% recurring monthly commission. My logic is that since the LTV is high and our overhead is capped, I’d rather give the lion's share to the person who brought the customer in, creating a \"sticky\" partnership.\nFor the experienced affiliate marketers here:\nDoes 60% sound \"too good to be true\"? Does a commission that high actually scare away professional affiliates because they think the business isn't sustainable?\n\nWe use Whop for our backend to ensure transparent tracking/payouts. In your experience, do affiliates prefer 3rd-party platforms like Whop? \n\nIf you were a small creator, what would you need to see besides the commission? (e.g., Live data audits, \"swipe files,\" \"documents/white paper\" or a free account to verify the tool ourselves?)\n\nI'm trying to build this lean and partner-focused.

      "selftext": "So here’s the story.\n\nI was looking at some car accessories and kept seeing the same products priced at what felt like a crazy markup. Out of curiosity, I started digging into Alibaba to see what the actual manufacturing cost looked like. After a decent amount of research into suppliers, reviews, and verifying the manufacturer, I pulled the trigger on one unit.\n\nWhen it arrived, I was honestly expecting stereotypical cheap Chinese knockoff quality. But it wasn’t. The build quality was on par with the name-brand US versions I’d been comparing it to.\n\nJust for fun, I threw it up on Facebook Marketplace to see if there was any interest. The response surprised me. My all-in cost including shipping was around $1,200. Comparable products were selling locally for $2,500+. I had multiple inquiries within days.\n\nSo now I’m testing it for real. Bought a few more units, planning to flip them. If it works, I’ll open an LLC and do everything above board.\nHere’s where my background helps: I work in logistics, so I’ve been able to optimize shipping and cut some costs that I think most people wouldn’t know how to avoid. I’m wondering if that gives me a legitimate edge, or if this whole space is so saturated that margins get crushed the moment you try to scale.\n\nMy questions for this community:\n\n\t∙\tIs the “Alibaba to local resale” model played out, or are there still niches where this works?\n\t∙\tDid I just get lucky with this particular product category, or is there a repeatable process here?\n\t∙\tFor those who’ve done this: what’s the capital requirement to actually make it a real business vs. a side hustle?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s tried this, whether it worked or didn’t. Not looking for validation; just trying to figure out if this is worth pursuing seriously or if I should just enjoy the quick wins and move on.",

          "body": "I do a ton of sourcing and importing as a service. I work with basically the future version of you, companies who already have sales to justify volume. Just for context anyway.\n\n\\- Is Alibaba to local played out?\n\nNo. But it's less about the business structure and more about what type of product actually sells locally, is there used versions available locally, and how to play it off. For some products, yes, it's played out. Maybe not having anything to do with it coming from Alibaba, vs maybe just there is a lot of competition on Marketplace with just used ones. Or, there just isn't the demand. Be careful with just getting interest. Marketplace is natorious for tons of people asking if it's still available, but not ultimately selling it. I don't know why, just how people behave on the platform.\n\n\n\n\\- Did you get lucky?\n\nI guess I wouldn't know. I don't know that luck has much to do with business. You took a chance and it paid off (Assuming it sold, I didn't catch if it did or not)\n\n\n\n\\- Is there a repeatable process?\n\nI'm assuming you mean, can you repeat this with other products? The answer is basically the first question. It depends on your local dynamics. \n\n  \n\\- Is there a real business here?\n\nNo, it's a side hustle. It won't scale. Meaning, to make more money, you have to work harder. There is very little you can do to change that. And you will have to continue essentially finding entirely new products to take that chance on as the old ones get local market saturation.\n\n That's not to say it's  not worth pursuing for the fun, experience and maybe side cash. But what this does do is ties your time and money up on something with limited potential. If you don't have a lot of entrepreneurial dreams, this is fine. But if you do have those dreams, aside from this being a good learning experience, it's what will keep you from those dreams. It absolutely will hold your entrepreurial dreams back if you ever wanted to have something less side hustle and more full on scalable business.\n\n\n\n\\- Does your logistics background help?\n\nAbsolutely. A lot of people that get into reselling, regardless of the platform. They have cost prohibitive freight costs. If you have solved that problem, you are ahead of the curve no matter what you do. It essentially adds a layer of competitive advantage on landed cost. At least as far as you can have with shipping so few. But judging by the price point, I am assuming the CBM is relatively large. Meaning shipping just a few can still be above the first tier of economies of scale. Of course if you ship a whole container at once, or at least the more CBM the lower the cost. But if your outlet is marketplace, that probably isn't a possibility. Then it becomes filling that CBM with multiple different products. But honestly, I don't see that being a good business if your outlet is just market place. You might be better off actually starting a brand where you have a site and try to get distribution. Just the larger the item, the harder that gets because of the then shippng cost to the end user. But, still maybe worth looking into.\n\n\n\n\\- LLC?\n\nNo, don't do this until you have proven there is enough sales to justify. You are selling on a platform known for buying used things. You are selling them as an individual. You don't have nearly the level of reason to protect yourself as someone really needing that LLC or whatever structure. Of course you still report the income as pass-through, so you are legit enough. If you go into selling serious volume, then yes. But at this level, it's a hard not-worth-it.",

It works for sure, but the real question is how long you gonna stay ahead.\n\nThis thing is super saturated, so finding a niche is something you hold close to your chest. There’s a ton of VA’s  and full time resellers who literally spend all day scrolling Facebook Marketplace looking for the exact same deals you’re chasing.\n\nHere’s what usually happens. You’ll knock out five units quick at $2,500 each and feel like you just discovered fire. Then all of a sudden nothing moves. Next thing you know, the same item shows up from somebody else at $2,300. You drop yours to $2,200 to keep selling. They go lower. You go lower again.\n\nPretty soon you’re in a full on race to the bottom and eating your own profits.\n\nSo your real edge is gonna be that logistical experience on the import side. Mind if I ask you some questions regarding logistics? \n\nWhen ordering from Alibaba and scaling up, what are some of the specific tricks you’re using to keep shipping and import costs low that most beginners totally miss? Like smarter freight choices, consolidation, duty stuff, or anything else that’s actually saving you money and helping protect those margins?\n\nInterested in learning more.

      "selftext": " I opened a car wash and I’m 18.\n\nI didn’t go to university and I’m not planning to. But honestly I feel really sad because I keep feeling like I’m “missing something” and maybe I don’t have a real future And I’m actually a failure because my standardized testing scores are all bad.\nI opened the car wash after borrowing 53k$ from my dad (he’s not rich he just believed in me) It took me 3 months to convince him I went to him every day until he finally agreed.\nRight now the business makes around 13k/month in revenue, and about 4000$/month net profit (because it’s Manuel car wash with workers) (even while paying back the loan).\nBut despite that, I feel like something is missing in my life I can’t even explain it properly\nI don’t have stories. I don’t have friendships. I don’t have that university life where people talk, hang out, and share experiences Most of my time I just sit doing nothing I feel empty and far away from people my age.\nI started thinking maybe I should use the money to study abroad (I’m in Saudi) on my own just to “live” and not waste my youth but at the same time I need to manage the car wash.\nAny advice from entrepreneurs who’ve been through something like this? Or had that same sense of emptiness? What would you do if you were in my position?",

Most of the times the feeling passes but if it lingers you may need to think inward and explore what your true passions are in life and pursue them. \n\nI went from climbing and cutting to management lately and grew very unhappy and complacent in work and life. Always feeling like something was missing. I found out that went away when I actually got out and did tree work which is my passion. I did more exploring within myself and realized I love helping others so I started another tree service (non-profit) that helps people at subsidized or no cost. \n\nIn conclusion, find out what you have a true passion for whether it’s in work or a hobby and let that bring you fulfillment and joy. The car wash may just be income but don’t give up on it. If you can find joy in other parts of your life the negative feelings about the car wash will go away. From one stranger to another I am incredibly proud of you for starting a business and I wish you success!\n\nYou need to travel. This will help some of the feelings you have but don’t lose sight of your business. Also, consider getting a mentor or a psychologist/therapist. This can help sort through your thoughts and come to your own conclusions. See the car wash through, scale it, hire employees that can run it without you but don’t stop managing the business. You’ve made a commitment to your dad and yourself. See it through.",

You will meet others in the same place in life, although you'll most likely be the youngest. I think you could, from this point, begin a journey of accumulating assets, which will help get you separated out in a good way, to a place of financial independence. Learn about real estate, for example, and all of the different ways to make money with residential properties. Read the book Rich Dad, Poor Dad. There's this woman, Codie Sanchez, who has a PhD, worked on Wall Street, and now owns a portfolio of businesses. This video is about doing exactly that: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtS8rOAqoM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtS8rOAqoM), and she teaches you how to approach owners to buy their business, using their money.

I would suggest applying yourself to growing your business and/or expanding.  Obviously, you want to save up a reserve of cash and pay down your loan (early, if you can) but also maybe save up to purchase your next business or expand your existing one.  If people are waiting for their car to get washed, you have a captive audience so you might be able to add retail like coffee, juice, snacks, car accessories, etc.  \n\nAlso, I don't know how it is in Saudi, but in the US as a business owner your are part of a special club of business owners.  Other business owners will likely talk to you and treat you as an equal.  Go around to the businesses near you (and any others you are interested in) and ask for the owner and introduce yourself.  Say \"My name is Joe Bob and I own the car wash down the street and I just wanted to introduce myself.\"  You will probably be surprised that they will likely be happy to show you around their business and talk business with you, even direct competitors.  You can make a lot of friends this way and do a lot of business networking.  Also, try to get to know the owners of your suppliers if they are local or find local suppliers whose owners you can know personally.\n\nAnd you can hang out with your employees, just try to keep business separate.  Take the crew out for a few drinks or pizza or something after closing, have company picnics or BBQ's, etc. Invite their families.",

So be patient, because most people take their entire 20’s and beyond to really answer these questions. Spend the next 2 years saving every penny you possibly can. Start in investment account and buy index funds. Use the rest of the money to fund your next adventure.

      "selftext": "I just finished watching Alex's new \"26 Lessons\" video. It’s long, but honestly, there were some gems in there that hit pretty hard. I took notes for myself and figured I’d drop them here to save you guys the time.\n\nHere you go:\n\n**On Mindset &amp; Psychology**\n\n* **Fear lives in the vague.** If you’re scared, write down the absolute worst-case scenario in detail. Usually, it’s just \"sleeping on a friend's couch,\" not dying. Once it’s on paper, it’s not scary.\n* **Mental Toughness &gt; Motivation.** He breaks toughness down into: How much bad stuff can you take? How low do you get? How fast do you bounce back? And do you come back better?\n* **The \"Heavyweight Champion\" move is doing nothing.** When someone insults you or triggers you, your gut wants to punish them. But usually, doing nothing is the only move that actually gets you what you want (them going away).\n* **Think for yourself.** Most people are just picking \"identity packages\" off the shelf (Hipster, Redneck, etc) and adopting those beliefs. If you can't explain why you believe something, it's not your thought.\n* **It's okay to just make money.** Don't fall for the \"Third Marshmallow\" trap where you delay gratification until you're dead. At some point, you have to reap what you sowed.\n\n**On Business Strategy &amp; Growth**\n\n* **No \"New\" Stuff.** New is risky. The hierarchy is: Do **More** of what works &gt; Do it **Better** \\&gt; Do something **New** (only as a last resort). He only allows himself one new big project a year.\n* **Plan life first.** Once you have money, you’re paid for judgment, not hours. So prioritize sleep and an empty calendar. Let business fill the cracks, not the other way around.\n* **Ignorance isn't a defense.** Learn the laws and contracts. \"Lawyer stuff\" eats your brainpower if you don't understand the rules of the game.\n* **The Founder's Will.** The biggest risk isn't running out of cash, it's the founder just not wanting to do it anymore. You need a \"why\" that survives past the point where the money is \"enough.\"\n\n**On Team &amp; Leadership (The harsh truths)**\n\n* **The Leader is always the problem.** If a department sucks, the leader sucks. Period.\n* **A-Players or nothing.** You know if someone is an A-Player in the first 14 days. If you don't know by then, they aren't one. Cut them.\n* **A-Players hate B-Players.** If you keep mediocre people, your stars will leave.\n* **Hard conversations save millions.** If you can't have a tough talk when stakes are low (contracts), you guarantee a lawsuit when stakes are high.\n* **Delegation is painful.** The spiritual path of entrepreneurship is constantly giving up control. \"Scale Zero\" means if a task requires you, it’s broken.\n\n**On Marketing &amp; Brand**\n\n* **The Offer is King.** You can't out-market a bad offer. A good offer makes people feel stupid saying no. (Razor: Can you pitch it in a text message and get a \"yes\"? If not, it's too complex).\n* **Clear &gt; Clever.** No one is listening. You have to repeat yourself until you die.\n* **Brand is the Moat.** In an AI world, execution is commoditized. Who people trust is the only defense. Give away the secrets, sell the implementation.\n* **Volume wins.** You need thousands of ad creatives. He used like 5,000 variations for his book launch.\n\nP.S. Add yours - let's make a mega thread which is packed with value for all.",

Customers would make less impulsive purchases. It slows the whole system down for the store as there is a choke point. More product returns. If you look at grocery, it's mostly large chains with few employees and instead it's the distributers stocking the shelves, and that's why you can't get someone to help you and when they do they said \"i don't work here, sorry.\"  Grocery is mostly a real estate business today. An exception is Trader Joes which is a completely different model but you still pick it yourself. Incidentally, trading stores in the US worked the way you describe in 1800s before the modern grocery store was invented. You would go to the counter and tell the man what you wanted to buy. If you are interested in this topic, there's an episode of the Acquired podcast about Trader Joes that is fascinating.",

Staying out of stores and doing the pickup option for convenience became very popular during Covid, but near the end of Covid, people were ready to get out and back into stores. This divided customer base made omnichannel shopping far more important. People appreciated the option to walk around and browse, but there were some people who wanted to strictly purchase what they wanted and needed without the hassle of going into stores and possibly buying things they didn’t intend impulsively. \n\nAll this leads me to believe that AR/VR shopping is going to be a big middle ground once the tech catches up and becomes convenient enough for consumers to wear the displays and shop either with AR rendered 3D models in their own homes or via a full VR shopping experience where the customer could effectively “pilot” a robot shopper to walk the aisles and shop. Then, to save on labor costs, items that are purchased with be picked and packed by other robotics either for pickup or delivery. Amazon has had a patent on a massive drone warehouse for a while now where the orders would be picked and shipped from this warehouse blimp via drone delivery. So I think that’s part of the puzzle as well.",

Almost 80% growth. But here's the thing, last year I had WAY less stress. I was working with maybe 5 jobs that month, everything was straightforward repairs, barely any issues. This year I took on 12 jobs because I didnt want to turn anyone down before the holidays and honestly I'm burnt out. Two of them turned into complete nightmares with hidden problems behind the walls.\n\nI had a bit of money saved up from Stаke which helped me say yes to everything but now I'm wondering if I'm actually doing better or if I just traded peace of mind for more revenue??

      "selftext": "If you are in your late teens or early twenties, chances are you have felt it: a quiet but persistent sense that life is slipping by without real direction. You have ambitions like achieving financial freedom, building a family one day, giving back through charity, or simply having deep, reliable friendships. But somehow, the drive to make those things happen fades quickly. Motivation comes in waves, and the only time you feel truly alive and excited is during short escapes that leave you emptier afterward. You know you should get serious, start building habits, and chase what matters, but purpose feels out of reach. You are not alone in this. Millions of young people today wrestle with the same emptiness, and there is a clear reason why it has become so common.\n\nSomething fundamental changed around the early 2000s. Before that time, most people discovered their interests through living. You would go out into the world, experience something directly, feel a spark of curiosity, and then actively seek out more information using whatever tools existed. Schools, conversations with mentors, libraries, trial and error. Your path felt self-directed because it grew naturally from your own encounters and choices. You ended up where you were because you chose to go there.\n\nToday the flow runs in the opposite direction. Information floods toward you constantly through phones and screens, carefully selected and pushed by algorithms, companies, and hidden agendas. Interests are handed to you ready-made instead of discovered through experience. Attention gets captured before you even decide what you care about. Over time, this reverses the natural order: curated content shapes your desires, pulls your focus outward, and leaves you in a life that often feels like it belongs to someone else. The constant noise drowns out your own voice, making it hard to know what you truly want or why anything matters.\n\nThis reversal explains the widespread feeling of being stuck. When everything competes for your attention, nothing feels worth giving it to. Quick dopamine hits from scrolling, gaming, or other escapes become the only reliable source of excitement because they are designed to deliver instant reward. Meanwhile, the slower rewards of building skills, relationships, or long-term goals feel distant and uncertain. Purpose requires space, reflection, and ownership, but the modern environment leaves little room for any of those.\n\nThe way out starts with reclaiming control, one small step at a time. Begin by creating quiet moments each day to listen to yourself. Ask basic questions: What activities absorb me completely? What kind of person do I respect and want to become? Write the answers down honestly. This simple habit cuts through the external chatter and helps you reconnect with your inner direction.\n\nFrom there, pick one small action that moves you toward a goal you care about and do it daily. Ten minutes of reading about money management if financial freedom matters to you. A short walk or workout if you want to feel stronger. Consistency builds momentum far better than occasional bursts of effort. When distractions pull you away, notice it without harsh judgment and gently return to what you chose.\n\nSeek real-world connections that support growth. Join groups, clubs, or online communities built around shared interests. Show up as yourself, contribute, and listen. Authentic friendships and mentors appear when you engage steadily over time, not when you chase quick bonds.\n\nIf excitement only shows up in unhealthy ways right now, experiment with healthier sources. Try physical challenges, creative outlets, volunteering, or time in nature. These activities can awaken the same energy in sustainable forms.\n\nHelpful starting points include books such as Atomic Habits by James Clear for building reliable routines, or Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl for understanding purpose in difficult seasons. Free courses on platforms like Coursera or Khan Academy let you explore skills without pressure. Mindfulness apps can train your mind to stay present amid the noise.\n\nProgress will feel slow at first, and that is normal. Be patient as you rebuild the habit of directing your own life. By stepping away from endless feeds and toward deliberate choices, you create space for genuine meaning to emerge. Many have walked this path before you and found their way forward. You can too. The life you actually want is still within reach, waiting for you to start choosing it.",

          "body": "This describes something I have felt for a long time but never really had words for.\n\nFor me the “lost” feeling did not come from a lack of information. If anything I had too much of it. I knew what I should be doing, saving money, building skills, working on something meaningful. The problem was I never turned any of that into real action.\n\nWhat helped was not a big mindset shift but doing small things in the real world and sticking with them longer than the initial excitement. Building something tiny. Testing an idea. Even failing at it. That process gave me more clarity than months of thinking or consuming content ever did.\n\nAt some point I realised purpose does not show up first and then action follows. It is usually the other way around. You act first and meaning slowly forms around it.\n\nOne small thing that helped me move from vague ambition to actual doing was looking at real problems instead of abstract goals. I came across **StartupIdeasDB** while browsing ideas and what stood out was how specific and grounded the problems were. It made starting feel less overwhelming.\n\nYour point about algorithms shaping desire is very real. When everything is constantly pushed at you, it is hard to know what you actually care about. Doing something on your own, even if it is boring or imperfect, gives that sense of ownership back.\n\nThanks for writing this. Posts like this are rare and needed.",

Today it’s reversed. Interests, goals, and even identities are presented to us constantly before we’ve had the chance to experience them ourselves.\n\nWhen everything competes for attention, nothing feels worth committing to. Quick dopamine becomes the only thing that reliably “works,” while long-term goals feel vague and distant.\n\nReclaiming purpose often begins with small steps: creating a quiet space, choosing one thing you care about, and acting on it consistently without waiting to feel fully motivated. Direction doesn’t usually appear first. It emerges *after* you start moving.\n\nIt feels like a lot of people aren’t broken; they’re just living in an environment that makes it hard for them to hear their own voice.",

I figured it'd be easier than hunting thrift stores every weekend. Half the sellers dont even have accurate inventory counts. I placed an order for 50 phone cases last month and the guy messages me 3 days later saying he only has 38 left. Then I had to wait another week for a partial refund because apparently thats just how it works. Second issue is quality control is basically nonexistent when buying in bulk. I ordered what was supposed to be brand new chargers and when I got them half had scratches and looked like returns.  Theres no way to see all the variants side by side or check all the product photos in one view so Im literally opening like 15 tabs trying to figure out which supplier has the best deal. Sometimes items are already sold out by the time I decide and I cant even buy directly through any kind of bulk ordering system, its just regular checkout which is annoying when youre trying to move fast.

Something more unorthodox, not meat-and-potatoes.\n\nFor me it's Huberman's morning light routine. Not sure how well-known he's here, but that shit's a blessing. Since i started getting sunlight (or staring at a lamp) my overall capacity and stability levels have increased dramatically.  \n\nAlso, 1 hour \"buffer\" time - my time, first thing in the morning. Walk alone in silence with my own thoughts, meditate, journal a bit. Clear my head, reorient on what matters the most, while trying to avoid obsessing about it (yeah, I know). If I start skipping this or cutting it short, my performance and quality of life start inching down. 100%.\n\nNo gadgets, obviously, but if I were you I'd push gadgets at least until noon, if not even past 1-2pm. If there's something truly critical or urgent they will get a hold of, don't worry. Shield your damn energy and focus, that's the only things you've truly got. Time has no value if you have attention span of a toddler.\n\nShare your experience.\n\n",

And I slowed down by choice, not by force.\n\nBurnout being a function of hours is a myth; its a function of alignment. \n\nYou dont have to love what you. Hell, you dont even have to have a passion for it, per se. You just need to deeply understand why youre doing it.\n\nTheres no magic bullet for drive, but here's what I've learned after building an 8 figure business as a result:\n\n1. Routines aren't enough. Rituals are everything. Routines can be broken, rituals cannot be compromised. For 12 years I wore essentially the same outfit every day, went to sleep at the same time, got up at the same time, ate the same things, etc. This wasnt because I enjoyed it, it was because it spared the energy thinking about shit like that, and allowed me to focus on building, working, creating.\n\n2. Health is key. The healthier you are, the more you can sustain. In the early years I drank a lot (part of my ritual 😬) but as the years went on and I began to get more intentional about my health, the days got easier. \n\n3. Have a goal (or goals). Affirmations, vision boards, mission statements, etc... I dont care what medium works best for you just understand why youre busting your ass so hard. And remind yourself every day.\n\n4. Finally, measure progress by months or years, never by days. If you try to measure progress by the day working like that you'll get discouraged, overwhelmed, and just shut down. But if you can look back on the years to see how far you've come, tomorrow has more purpose.\n\nIm sure theres more but thats what I can think off the top of my head. \n\nAt the end of the day you must answer:\n\nHow bad do you want it?\n\nAnd what are you willing to sacrifice to get it?\n\nBonus: Whats *really* important to you? \n\nMy two cents.",

This is also the case in the winter, but I go for half a block. Adjust timing as it suits you, some people do really well using a pomodoro cycle.\n\n- Context switch. This is super important. Never wear clothes that you would normally wear around the house. At least wear jeans and a decent shirt/hoodie. Don’t wear joggers, sweatpants, etc. Save that for when you’re done with your work. \n\n- If you listen to some kind of content, use headphones that are tethered to your desk. I consider this part of my context switch. In ear monitors work especially well for me because they’re sort of annoying to take off/on. This adds another barrier to just getting up and going to do something else. You can get really good ones that sound better than all of the expensive wireless buds/phones I’ve ever used for like $50. Simgot ew200.\n\n- I’ve caught flack for this, but it works, and there’s nothing that suggests that this will produce problems long-term. When I’m making a big push, I work in an entirely dark environment except for my screens. Doing this makes it hard to even want to do anything else that day. I don’t know if this applies for other people, but I heard about it first from Alex Hormozi, and he seems to have similar things to say. But if it gives you headaches or you can feel eye strain, don’t be an idiot. Use other strategies.\n\n\nAdditionally, have bipolar disorder, medicated to the point that it’s manageable. Mood swings are not nearly as intense and debilitating as they once were. Through mood tracking and watchings signs of swings, I can harness the good parts of hypomanic swings and get an obscene amount of work done, so that’s part of my strategy. These overall strategies can apply to all phases of my mood, and their effectiveness generally follows suit. Depressive episodes are possible to do this with, but I usually get less done and I am more easily distracted.",

      "selftext": "I'm 25f, recently opened a marketing agency with my husband and we're expecting to make a good amount of money very soon which is great. I know the title sounds a little dramatic but I could genuinely use some advice especially if you're a bit older and a business owner. I married my husband a year and a half ago, left my country and moved to his, literally into his childhood bedroom. We're together 24/7, working 24/7. No weekends off. I haven't seen my family/friend for like 6 months and they don't even know what we're doing because we don't like to talk about it before we're successful. Actually, I didn't even talk to my dad in around 6 months but thats a different story. As you can probably imagine at this point, our social life is basically dead. \nTime really flies so I don't even really get the time to think about all the things I don't have time for, all I get is exactly 2,5 hours of break at night and that's barely enough to watch some show just to get my mind to stop thinking about work. \n\nWhen my family calls me at random times I almost get annoyed at them for thinking I have time to talk when all I can think of is how to get stuff done. I'm not sure if anyone can relate but my family history is quite diffcult. Addiction and depression, money issues and all of that stuff so running away from that to actually build something that could potentially solve my families problems is what gives everything I do a meaning. Is this something anyone else experiences? And if so, how the f do you deal with it? I don't really wanna make time for anything else but at the same time I feel like people are starting to build resentment because I make them feel like I don't care when it's the opposite. \n\n\nEdit: A lot if you are basically saying \"just talk to them\" which yeah ofc makes sense lol it's family. But I guess not everyone comes from my background so I'll elaborate. I got two bipolar brothers that are both thousands in depth and a bipolar alcoholic unemployed dad with a god complex that was absent for 15 years of my life and lives in a \"third world\" country with another family which means I have another brother thats 14 years old that I feel responsible for. My mom is probably the most normal but even she used to be gone travelling around the world with strange men when I was 14. So talking to my family isn't just a quick nice chat it's usually stressful. It's not even that we argue, but there's always a problem. Money, mental health or someone's about to become homeless LOL. It's not that easy to focus on work and be in contact with them without getting dragged into some Bs. I hope that helps to understand my situation. ",

Replace this with walks or healthy meal prep or reading a book. \n\n2. As soon as you can, hire staff to help reduce the burden. Even before you start making “a good amount of money”. \n\n3. You and your partner should both go out one night a week. Together or even better apart. You don’t have to spend much. But that bedroom will do you in. \n\n4. Remember that your doing today what other people won’t so that you can have tomorrow what other people can’t. I sacrificed much of my 20s into\nmy businesses, but today I have it better than most. \nThere is no balance in the beginning. Don’t listen to the part time “life coaches” that tell you there should be. But try to squeeze in a little bit of personal time. This is where your aha moments come from. Kind of like finding your keys when you stop looking so hard for them. \n\n5. Eat as healthy as you can. Bad food leads to low energy and less than ideal states of mind. \n\n6. Your why is VERY powerful. Print it out and put it up on your wall along with anything else you want. Your partner could do the same. Smile every time you look at it and imbue it with emotion. \n\n7. Talk to your family during your 2.5hrs. You can combine this with walking or meal prepping. When they ask what you’re doing, just let them know you’ll tell them when the time is right.\n\nAnd in the words of Tim Ferris: “Find joy and delight in everything you do”\n\nYou’ve got this!!",

Ofc they can’t do that so much, that you can’t focus on it. But yes you do need to talk to them, when they need it and maybe even you too. For some people that have a shitty family situation, it’s easier to just cut it and become obsessed with work and success. Eventually they’ll either come around or not. They’ll eventually understand, maybe. But you do need to understand it’s your life, so do you. If they try to stop you by time draining then that’s another story then they aren’t your family they are an enemy. But if they care about you, they want to spend time with you and support you. Also it will help make your journey a tiny better. It’s just money and work. For some it’s a way out, for others it’s a way of supporting or other situations, we all have our motivations for why. But you could end up building bad feelings as a byproduct if they feel like they are a burden to your work. But again it depends on the situation, from an visionary perspective. Do you, but don’t ruin your family if they care and love you. That’s stupid. But also practically some people actually don’t need that much time if we boil it down. But you do need to enjoy each other’s company when together and make quality time. And remember money have ruined a lot of families. Don’t say it will, but be careful.

Insurance certificates expired. Banking details sent in separate threads.\n\nWhat should be a simple setup turns into weeks of back-and-forth before work or payment can even begin. Preflight is an attempt to fix that quietly. Not by adding more review steps, but by preventing incomplete vendor onboarding from reaching teams in the first place.\n\nIt’s early. Still shaped by conversations with ops and finance folks. But it’s been the most grounded thing I’ve worked on this year.",

Not at Lan parties, not at eSports events, not on your clan or guild website and especially not with your face on it because you are a famous streamer. Unless you have big boobs maybe. But even then it will not justify the effort. Best outcome will be you have free drinks on your next clan lan party and everyone gives 20 bucks to get rid of your inventory. Concentrate on your collectibles. Cheap worthless crap people don't need always sells well and has huge margins. Especially if you have famous promoters. If you don't want to rebrand, just duplicate your existing sales infrastructure with different branding and without energy drinks.

You don't have product-market fit for the energy drinks. Something is off in who you're selling it to, what you're selling, how you're selling it, or why your target audience would want to buy it. This business needs it's foundations looked at, starting with the ideal customer you want to serve, what is their name, what do they care about, and why they make energy-drink buying decisons.\n\n\n\nBusiness Two is a plushie/collectible biz, which so far, you HAVE got the hang of. You know who you're selling to. They clearly want the product (plushie-collectibles). They know why they're buying it, at least subconsciously, and you can clearly see the demand. This business could be scaled up if you want to earn some solid income, or it can be closed/sold if it's not a business you're interested in being in.\n\n\n\nIf the businesses are meant to work as one, ie: two-sides-of-one-business, similar to red bull's sports-media branch + red bull's energy drink branch, then you'll either need to find a way to make both profitable, or accept one will always be a loss-leader, not meant to generte income, but instead to found a culture/movement. This is ambitious though, and usually something that is done AFTEr you have a successful product, as the culture will build around it. Technically still doable, but like I said, ambitious if you don't already understand biz basics.\n\n\n\nThe \"name\" issue is irrelevant until you understand the businesses, and who the businesses will be serving, because whatever name you choose must resonate with, and appeal to, the target market (as opposed to turning them off.)\n\n\n\nUltimately the seemingly money-obsessed (or at least money-focused) people in the comments likely aren't worth listening to.\n\n\n\nYou don't have to make important life decisions such as what you're gonna do as your career for the next little while based off of \"money.\"\n\n\n\nThe truth is that consumers will flow dollars to you for *all sorts of things,* when marketed and sold to in ways that resonate with them. This means you can absolutely succeed with energy drinks, or you can succeed with plushies. The only difference is, you stumbled on product-market-fit with one of those already, but not the other.\n\n\n\nThis means plushies will feel \"easier\" for now, since you've got past one of the hardest parts of business, but it doesn't mean you can't do similar with energy drinks.\n\n\n\nIn any case, understanding business deeply, and approaching the situation with calm, maturity, and inner-peace while looking objectively at the facts of the matter, will empower you to make a decision that will serve all involved to the highest level possible.",

AI answers still need sources, and those sources come from places that already have visibility and trust on the web.\n\nWhat I’m seeing in practice is that brands still get discovered through a mix of things: strong content, third-party mentions, communities, and existing authority. LLMs don’t magically invent answers, they remix what they already trust. If you’re not part of that ecosystem, you won’t show up.\n\nThe big change is you can’t rely only on “ranking a page” anymore. You have to understand where AI systems are pulling information from and why certain brands get mentioned repeatedly. That’s pushed me to focus more on being present on the pages and publications AI models already cite, not just optimizing my own site.\n\nI still treat SEO as the foundation, but now I also track which queries trigger AI answers, where competitors are being mentioned, and which sources keep showing up. Tools that give visibility into AI mentions and citations help connect the dots so you’re not guessing and help in quick execution.\n\nSo it’s less 'AI replaces Google' and more 'discovery gets redistributed.'

The AI answer boxes pull from existing content so the fundamentals still matter, you just can't rely on ranking page one and calling it a day anymore. The game is shifting toward being the source that AI references rather than the link someone clicks.\n\nWhat actually determines if AI mentions you is the same stuff that always mattered for authority. Backlinks from reputable sites, being cited in industry publications, having content that's genuinely comprehensive on specific topics. With our clients we've started tracking brand mentions in ChatGPT and Perplexity responses and the ones showing up consistently are the ones with strong PR presence and lots of third-party validation.\n\nThe tools tracking AI mentions are still pretty new and I'd be skeptical of anyone claiming they can \"boost\" your visibility in AI answers. That sounds like the next generation of snake oil SEO services. What you can control is creating content that answers specific questions better than anyone else and getting mentioned by sources the models are trained on.\n\nHonestly the bigger shift is that discovery is fragmenting across dozens of channels now.

Handles everything (payroll, time, taxes) and has clean integrations with QuickBooks/Xero. Decent UI and solid support.\n\nRippling (US) - A step up if you want serious automation. Accurate time tracking, native integrations. Bit pricier but scales well.\n\nFactorial/Sesame HR (Europe) - If you need the full HR package beyond time tracking. Well-made but can be overkill for just payroll + time.\n\nSomething I've noticed almost nobody solves well is the connection between hours worked → projects → actual profitability. Most tools give you the data but you have to manually crunch numbers to know if a project is actually making money or bleeding it. There are some newer options (like [Regist.es](http://Regist.es) in the European market) specifically focused on that: seeing real-time margin per project while the team clocks in/out. For teams with field workers or multiple simultaneous projects, that visibility changes management quite a bit. (Still in development but they let me check out a demo - the approach is interesting.)\n\nMy advice: If you just need basic payroll + hour tracking, QuickBooks Payroll integrated might be enough. If you need profitability visibility per project on top of time tracking, look for something that connects those dots automatically.\n\nAre your workers office-based or in the field? Do you manage multiple projects at once or is it more continuous operations?",

Fast forward to 2025, and we are bankrupt.\n\nHere is the nightmare: A large State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) in China owes us a significant amount of money. They used the software we built for nearly 3 years. When they refused to pay the remaining balance, I took them to court in their local jurisdiction.\n\nI fought this legal battle for a year. Last week, the final verdict came out: I lost. The court dismissed my claims because the client never provided a formal \"Acceptance Certificate\" (a document required to prove the project is finished). Essentially, they used the software for years but refused to sign the paper saying it was \"done,\" so they didn't have to pay.\n\nNow I am buried in debt and feel completely hopeless. I’m angry and at a loss for words.\n\nI genuinely want to know: Does this happen in other countries? If a client uses your work for 2.5+ years but refuses to sign the acceptance paperwork, does the law let them get away with it? Where is the justice?",

Money allocated to buying your product will often end up in managers' and local officials' pockets, especially when you offer to install a full working version first that they can use to \"prove\" to corruption investigators that it was paid for.  \n\nIf third-party escrow services aren't an option, with a software system you can install a temporary license file for site acceptance, and once they make final payment install the permanent license. Don't tell them about it, though, and if the temporary license file expires (say, after six months) have your system throw up \"data misconfigured, unable to start\" type error messages, and to call customer support. \n\nThat's what we did with a fairly corrupt government agency, and when they called for help to get it running (despite not making the final payment) we said we'd start support once we received payment. They ghosted us (the money was long gone), and some years later when they were audited in an anti-corruption drive, the investigators asked us why that expensive system was apparently never used. I had to testify (via zoom fortunately) and the main bosses went to jail. We did get the initial 30% down payment so it wasn't a total loss for us, though.",

I can actually make a case that people who want to be in management sometimes ignore that having responsibility over employees isn't as empowering sa they think as they in some cases become baby sitters. Sometimes having a boss(and it has to be the right boss) is much better tha being the boss\n\nand lastly, one thing I can say from experience(and I'm a person who has been self employeed most of my adult life)..the 5-6 years I worked for someone, I'm not complaining about my current situation. I'm happy, I'm content...but I'm also more lazy than I hsould be(though my customers and employees are ALWAYS taken care of)..look, I'm on reddit at work? That is crazy.\n\n  \nso I was a music major in college and at one time was a pretty good musician(not I'm just fine)..but one reason GREAT musicians might study with an teacher(getting private lessons) isn't because they aren't able to record themselves and hear what they did right or wrong...but rather because a teacher keeps them honest\n\n  \nI do alright. My business is sitting pretty well(of course it isn't as if I don't have concerns about what the future holds but it has been awhile since I've really been stressed out about cash flow and overall business is decent...but I'll get a little anxiety in the middle of january as this is my slow time of year and I don't lay anyone off and it is sometimes hard keeping them all busy..but anyway)\n\n  \nI'm a hard worker and I think I'm a good boss and I was a GREAT employee. That being said it doesnt' take much to convince me to take off work a little early somedays...or take a friday off. Like I said, I'll take care of all my customers and my employees but there are always things I could be doing that are more productive when it comes to growing my business. I don't put off things i HAVE to do but I could be working on a project today that would help me boost revenue. I'm giving my employees the rest of the week off(i actually do have things that they could do in Friday...but it isnt' time sensitive.\n\n  \nmy point is if I had that teacher keeping me honest and making sure I was doing some of the things that would probably benefit my business..I'd probably be selling more but times have been decent so it has been kinda easy to take that extra time off where as some people would probably keep me more on taast",

This particular factor, is not a threat. \n\nCan you imagine not just losing a sale, but losing $1,200 in shipping, on top of the $1,200 sale or, spending an additional $800 to lose a $1,200 product, trying to satisfy someone, who cannot be satisfied AND they still leave a bad review... Just because that's the type of person they are?\n\nThe product was in high demand and short supply and, I could tell which customer was going to be a pain in the ass/loss, before they even spent their money... Maybe it's not great customer service but, if I had to choose the potential customer who called once, with some basic questions, prior to purchase, who was clearly going to love and know how to use it properly, vs. the person who called 4 times, to hem and haw over how expensive it is, wasting hours of my time, demanding a discount, \"I offered you 10% off. No I cannot make shipping free. It costs $450.\n And we only charge $200,\" while having no experience with or understanding of how said product works, I know whose order I should be cancelling or, at least not digging a deeper financial hole to China, in an attempt to make them happy. \n\nThe written policy was, \"if it has been used. It is not returnable.\" We can help you fix it but, we can't fix you.

That's the point I finally hit last year when I started deciding what type of company to start.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I've always had an entrepreneurial spirit. I've always dreamed of starting a company, running the company, growing it, hiring people and paying them good wages, having good benefits for them and their families, etc etc. The real thrill though was that I wanted to have a product to call my own, and sell it to people.\n\nMy first attempt at doing sales was at a dealership right out of high school because \"I love cars, so it should be easy to sell them because I'll feed off that energy\". That was my first big lesson that it had to be the right product. Plus, the car sales game is sketch as hell, or at least that dealership was.\n\nHaving my own product (a SaaS app focused on the MSP space) releasing soon is everything I thought it would be. I love selling it to MSPs in this early pre-release stage, and I can't wait to start being more public about it and selling it more.",

The rest is answering emails, managing social media, tracking expenses, dealing with shipping issues, and trying to convince people my pieces are worth the prices I'm charging.\nLast week, someone asked why my necklace cost sixty dollars when they saw \"\"similar ones\"\" for ten dollars elsewhere. I tried explaining handmade quality versus mass production, but they just walked away. It's discouraging to have your work undervalued constantly.\nI've been sourcing some materials from Alibaba to keep costs manageable, which helps with margins, but I worry about maintaining quality while staying competitive on price. Finding that balance is exhausting.\nI'm starting to understand why so many small businesses fail in the first year. The romantic idea of being your own boss crashes hard against the reality of uncertain income and constant problem-solving. Some days I miss my old job security. Other days, I'm proud of every sale I make.\n\n",

Your target market isn’t customers buying $10 garbage. It’s customers interested in a higher quality product and willing to pay more for it. The key is you have to actually make it higher quality. \n\nThe question is also whether there is a market for what you’re selling.

There is a medicine that can help. Do it as a side hustle first! Test, test, and test it some more. Prove it works, and prove you can do it. Then slowly change over to it. \n\nI've seen this a lot with family and friends. Smart, capable people save a bunch of money and quit their job to run their own business. They buy all the things and fill out and sign all the contracts and think that's the hardest part, that's the easiest part! Managing a business while it struggles will take you to the brink, and nobody is prepared for it. \n\nI have a friend who started her own consulting business. Her logo is perfect, she pays every bill early, she spent weeks reading about local and federal taxes to make sure she paid everything correctly, all while her product floundered and she lost money. She was doing the easy stuff to feel productive. The stuff that had a manual. At great cost and a steep learning curve she is starting to make money, but she still struggles a lot and in 5 years has made much less than her day job she quit.\n\nI have a family member who bought a local serciving business. I remember him calling me in tears. \"It's so hard, I have to do everything! I take calls, I set the appointments, I have to do the bookkeeping, I just want to do the work.\" He then blamed me for not volunteering to help enough, so I stopped answering my phone. He eventually sold the bisiness for less than half of what he paid and got his old job back. BTW I told him not to buy it in the first place but he was convinced it would save him and make him happy, it did the opposite.\n\nLastly, I have a super successful friend. Very talented and makes good money being an engineer. Every few years he and his wife get ideas of buying a business. Generally they come to me with an existing business costing $200k to $500k. It has been a restaurant, a cafe, a gym, and recently a sandwich shop. Each time I tell them the same thing, are you prepared to fail and lose all of the money and a year or 2 of your life? And have a miserable time during that time. I also tell them to test and find a business they can start with little to no investment of money. They then decide against it. \n\nThis is probably going to hurt, but almost everyone I know that \"made it\" with their business started in their teens and 20s. You have less to lose and you're more resilient when you're younger. People in their 30s/40s and older have so much more to lose and much less resilience. Think long and hard before quitting your job. Test the business first, and try to start with no or very little startup capital. Having capital upfront will not make you more successful or learn faster, from what I  have seen it does the opposite.",

You could mark up the prices of the solar systems, get people to finance the whole thing, they’d save money from day 1, and we (door knockers/closers) would walk away with $3000-$7000 in commission on most deals.

So really I think it depends on the situation. \n\nThe advice I heard that I think is applicable here is to see if you as the business owner or boss are doing everything *YOU* should be doing to help the employee succeed. Essentially there are 4 things you should be doing. If you are doing all those things and the job is still not getting done, then it's time for them to go.\n\nThe four things you should be doing are ensuring they know what you want them to do, how to do the thing you want them to do, when that thing should be done by, and removing any obstacles that stop them from doing the thing.\n\n##1. What\nHaving a clearly defined role and set of responsibilities. If they don't know  what their role is and the responsibilities that come with it, they'll never be able to perform adequately. Clearly communicate the tasks they are responsible for completing.\n\n##2. How\nOnce they know their duties, confirm they know how to complete the job. For entry and mid level positions, SOPs are how you can give step-by-step instructions without having to constantly be present. For higher level positions that require more advanced or a larger variety of skills, and honestly most small business positions, training takes longer to get them familiar with how *your* business operates, or you're paying them enough to already come on with those skills already developed.\n\n##3. When\nIf they know what to do and how to do it, and it's still not getting done, then confirm they know the timeline. Tell them by when or how often they should be completing tasks. If you've told them once, remind them. You may not need to train them more, just a gentle reminder.\n\n##4. Obstacles\nIf they know what to do, how to do it, and when to have completed it, but it's still not getting done, check to see there isn't something external stopping them. The classic example is telling a chef you want a simple omelette for breakfast this morning and there being no eggs in your house/restaurant. Clearly despite the skills the chef has and the communication of your expectations, they won't be able to do it. Maybe the employee has an issue and they don't feel like they have the authority to \"fix\" the problem. Either fix it for them, go buy the eggs, or give them the authority and guidelines to fix it themselves.\n\nIf you as a business owner aren't making sure that your employees have everything they need to succeed, then you are failing your business in that respect.     \nSure, you may just have a bad hire, but that's also your fault for not vetting properly. Both management and hiring are skills you need to develop though, so it makes sense to suck at first.",

You shouldn't have to micromanage activity. If they're not willing to try their best, they aren't worth your effort. They will likely never change.\n\nIf you have to \"micromanage\" for quality or results (that's not micromanaging - it's training), it's often trainable as long as the effort and desire is there. There's an element of whether someone has the potential to succeed, but the truth is that most everything can be trained. Then, you have to decide whether the gap is small enough that you're willing to invest in bridging it. You should account for vacancy costs, hiring costs, and risk of new employee failure in that case. It's pretty high in some fields and VERY high in others (e.g. sales). The greater the complexity of the job, the more you should expect to train for quality and results.\n\nIf you're expecting to hire someone and for them to instantly be plug and play, then you're the problem and you shouldn't be managing people. That's not how it works for 99.9% of the population. Very few people have the tools to set themselves up for success in a new role and/or a new company.\n\nHire and fire for attitudes.

You know that they are having difficulties paying, but it's screwing you over after you've already provided services/products to them. Try to negotiate some solution: maybe they pay the biggest invoices first, maybe they pay the oldest first, maybe it's a simple payment plan where they pay $1000 a month. At the very least, if they shut down in 6 months, you'll have received *some* money back.\n\nDuring the Great Recession, the company I worked for really struggled to pay bills. I wasn't there, but my dad is the owner and there were many months where he did not get a paycheck so all the employees and utilities could get paid. The company had to negotiate many payment plans to not lose their vendor relationships. They felt awful not being able to pay, but they knew that not paying anything was screwing over the other businesses - after all, some of their own woes were from people not paying *them!* Some of the payment plans were really longterm (with the vendors with the best relationships we could lean on. some of the payment plan documents I saw lasted years.), some of them were much stricter and shorter.

      "selftext": "I sell cakes and I have ongoing overheads such as electricity, cooking gas, fuel, labour, website costs, insurance, rent (is a effing killer), internet, phone bills, ads/marketing etc....\n\nWhile the ingredients of the cake makes up a small portion, for example, I sell my cakes at a competitive price of $74.95 AUD and that's considered cheap in my niche cakes for a professional, niche baker\n\nI am not making that much profit after expenses.\n\nFor example a vanilla and white chocolate cake ingredients is around $10AUD, me physically making a cake is around 2-2.5 hours, as in actually moving and making the cake, not taking in idle time such as time baking in the oven, time resting the cake to cool down.\n\nIf I set myself a wage such as $25 which is around minimum wage in Australia, that's already $62.50 (2.5 hours) of labour + $10 ingredients, that's already $72.50 just in ingredients and labour.\n\nObviously as you know, more I sell, the more I can create at the same time, yay mass production.\n\nBut so many damn customers are like \"I can make it myself, ingredients is only $10\" and I just wanna say \"listen here ya little sh\\*t, here are all my expenses making the cake and you tell me if I am making $64 worth of PROFIT\"\n\nAnyways.... sorry small rant.",

I also offer tiered services, I have \"standard\" cakes made from premix, which is what most bakeries use. I have \"premium\" which are made from scratch and have better quality/longevity.

They said something about needing proof of my business operating address but all my stuff is registered to my home address in Toronto. Someone in a facebook group said i might need to set up a proper US business address if im dealing mostly with American clients and platforms. Apparently Wise and other payment processors are getting stricter about this stuff lately. My question is do i actually need a whole US address just to withdraw my own money?

The software puts it in the right 'pile'. Your accountant gets an easy ride, you get an overview.  And if you switch accountants, you STILL  have that overview. \n\nHere in the Lowlands of Belgium and the Netherlands, we have Silvasoft ( for bigger businesses,  also has a lot of add ons for different needs,  but subscription for just the add ons you need), and Dexxter for smaller businesses.  There's loads of others, but that's the ones I have experience with. \n\nSee if there's something similar, where you are.if there's not... perhaps a pioneer can make it happen 👀\n\nThe new system is dividing accountancy into 'small businesses that do the prepwork with software', and 'bigger businesses that have their own accountant' over here. \nThe plus side of the software  is that the overview you get from your excel sheet is in your account. You just click on what you want an overview of, and tahdah",

          "body": "Edit: just jumping in to say I absolutely confused cash flow for revenue in the below original comment and  the numbers are off in that regard, but the below analysis should absolutely be considered for anyone buying a business. You will still need to factor in a huge hit of cash flow if financing any deal. That was my biggest shock when I bought my business.\n\n***\n\nOK I'm just going to approach this from a purely numbers perspective. Here's what I did.\n\nI bought a business with advertised revenue of 450k and Owner earnings of 150k. That 150k was split between a husband and wife that would both eventually exit.\n\nReality was the 450k was due to the pandemic, my normalized revenue first year was closer to 370k. I also gave all employees a 10% raise as soon as I took over, which pushed labor cost to be 50% of revenue due to the nature of this service business.\n\nMy projected yearly owner earnings were going to be 80k before purchase, but after purchase and Reality hit in the first 2 years it was closer to 40k per year. This is due to lower than expected revenue and insane interest on the SBA loan I took out. \n\nBefore you purchase, consider this:\n1) 1m for 350k cash flow is a steep price, especially for a franchise. 350k per year is 30k per month. Are you financing the deal? \n\n1m financed with 20% down can expect a payment of around 10.7k per month. So you're down to 19.3k per month.\n\nExpect franchise fees of 10% from top line revenue. So we're down to 16.3k per month.\n\nNow, how much is labor going to cost you? In an ideal perfect scenario, it's 30% of revenue, but expect 40% until you get things figured out. This is no leadership hires. We are down to 6.3k per month. \n\nSo with 6.3k per month are you able to afford all other expenses to run the business AND pay yourself to live, AND pay a GM to run it all?\n\nThe answer is most certainly no. Unless you're buying it with cash, which frees up 10.7k per month, but I have a feeling that's not the case.\n\nHope this helps.",

They forget the **Debt Service**.\n\nIf you are financing this (SBA Loan), here is the rough 'Napkin Math' that kills the absentee dream:\n\n* **Advertised Cash Flow:** $350,000\n* **Less: General Manager:** ($90,000) - *You need a pro, not a shift lead.*\n* **Less: Loan Payments:** ($140,000) - *Assuming you finance $800k at current SBA rates (11% over 10 yrs).*\n* **True 'Passive' Cash Flow:** **$120,000**\n\n**The Question:** Is $120k/year enough reward for taking on **$1M in debt risk** in a 'Gray Area' regulatory industry (Kava)?\n\nI’m a Financial Strategist who models acquisitions like this. Before you sign an LOI, you need to run a **'Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)'** analysis with a sensitivity check:\n\n* *If regulations tighten and sales drop 15%, does the business still generate enough cash to pay the loan?*\n\nIf the answer is no, you could personally default on the loan even if the business is technically 'profitable.'\n\nHappy to help you run those loan scenarios if you want to see if the risk/reward actually makes sense.",

This is a very common google maps extortion scam and the agencies know about this. The first step is file a police compliant, file FBI with their online crime division, forgot their name, I3 or something. Then, appeal all these reviews. The appeal will most likely be rejected but you will get an appeal number. Make an excel list of all these fake reviews along with the appeals theyre under and then goto google business community page and look for similar cases. They will like you to post it in a certain way. Hopefully a diamond or a platinum member will pick this up and then they will block your account first and delete these. Its frustrating why Google allows reviews to be posted on US businesses from overseas.

For 19+ years, I watched all kinds of Entrepreneurs, startups both on and offline, small and mid-level businesses, and even my business go through what you're experiencing now.   \n  \nSo it's normal, almost an initiation of entering the business world. First, it's the setup of the dream, then reality starts to become apparent. You need to generate leads, drive traffic, engage, and move them to conversion and sales.\n\nThe more financially prepared you are, the less the stress. If you have the savings to pay for your bills while the business gains traction and builds, you are more likely to succeed than those who don't.\n\nSome operating on a shoestring can become successful. Some won't; the odds are against you, especially if you don't have real marketing and sales skills.\n\nThe real key is finding help that's seasoned and experienced in what you need next. Pricing is important, but don't judge capabilities based on how much they charge. I've seen a person who charges almost ridiculous low prices perform, and I've seen smooth-talking super expensive services fail.\n\nOver the years, you learn how to ask questions, and it's not always about the portfolio; it's about them explaining to you the what and how, and maybe even helping you first, so you learn to trust them.\n\nSo it sucks to be in the stage you're in now; it can go either way. If you want to discuss it more for additional knowledge, a discovery chat is always best because it's usually free with no obligation. You decide.\n\nMy DM is always open.\n\nHope that makes sense, Blessings!",

Sometimes i have to go through hell and when i feel weak, i ask these questions to myself and answers always lead me ahead in life. All the best!",
