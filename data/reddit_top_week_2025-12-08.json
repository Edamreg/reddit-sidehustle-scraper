      "selftext": "so 4 days ago i made that post asking for legit side hustles that work in 2025. no passive income bs, no guru crap.\n\nshit blew up. 750k views, 377 comments. i wasn't expecting that.\n\nspent the weekend going through literally every comment pulled the 5 that kept coming up with actual money being made and a process i think is legit.\n\ngonna list them out and want honest thoughts on which ones are legit vs which ones sound good but are actually harder than they seem.\n\noption 1: etsy digital products\n\nsomeone said they made $70k in 2 years selling digital stuff in a niche hobby area. started with $22 to open the shop. made the first product in 8 hours. 2 weeks later doing 100 sales a day at $3 each.\n\nthey used canva and photoshop to make it. no shipping, no personalization, just downloads. now they spend like 10 mins a week answering messages and clear $2k/month after etsy takes their cut.\n\nthe key they said was finding something people searched for but nobody was selling yet. gap in the market type thing.\n\noption 2: cleaning (commercial or residential)\n\nthis came up a TON. window cleaning, office cleaning, whatever. one guy in london started with a ladder and squeegee, now does six figures. another person cleans offices on weekends and pulls $3-4k extra per month.\n\nthey said buy basic equipment, make flyers in canva, post in facebook groups and nextdoor. for commercial some people use thumbtack or yelp to get started then go word of mouth to avoid fees.\n\nweekend office cleaning seems clutch because nobody's there to bother you. and it's recurring once you lock clients in.\n\noption 3: dog boarding at your house\n\nsomeone's making $36k/year extra doing this. started in 2021 on rover and wag. now most their clients book direct so they don't pay the 20-30% platform fees.\n\nprocess was make a rover profile first (wag apparently sucks for getting clients). good photos of your space. start cheap to build reviews. then be picky about which dogs you take. they use calendly for direct bookings and venmo/zelle for payments.\n\nyou can scale it or keep it small. up to you.\n\noption 4: ai content agency for high ticket clients\n\nokay this one was different. guy started 4 months ago, now at $3.2k/month. makes video content with ai tools for lawyers and real estate agents. charges $800-1200 per million views and not per video.\n\nuses midjourney and leonardo for images. runway and pika for video. capcut and some other editor for putting it together. eleven labs and argil for ai influencers and ai voice stuff.\n\nonly goes after lawyers and realtors because one client for them = huge money so they'll actually pay. started by cold dming a realtor on ig, made 10 free videos. guy got leads, been paying since.\n\noption 5: power washing\n\nsaw this almost as much as window cleaning. people saying $200-400 per driveway, $500-800 for full house. one person doing $6k/month on weekends only.\n\nbuy a gas power washer (simpson or ryobi got mentioned). learn from youtube. set up google business profile for free. post before/after pics in facebook marketplace and local groups. some people use jobber or housecall pro to manage the bookings and invoices.\n\ncan add gutter cleaning and deck staining to make more per job. seasonal in some places but prints in spring/summer.\n\nwhich one would you actually do? and has anyone here tried these and ate shit? what happened?\n\ntrying to figure out which one to commit to. not trying to dabble in 5 things. just want one that'll actually work.",

The Rover community, in my experience is incredible,  the dog owners are nice &amp; I've yet to have an issue with any dogs that I've cared for.\n\nYou get to set your own rates, services, preferences on types of pets. Rover does take a % but it is WORTH IT! The services they offer, insurance &amp; assistance is well worth whatever % they take TRUST ME ON THIS.\n\nIf an animal gets lost while in your care, they do EVERYTHING THEY CAN to get that animal back. The will pay other sitters to volunteer in your area to go on searches &amp; post flyers that ROVER pays for. They pay those volunteers a set rate on a daily basis if I'm not mistaken \n\nOnce you've become somewhat established &amp; obviously provide good services, the customers just kept flocking to me. There were times I had to decline requests because I just couldn't do it.\n\nMy services were doggy day care &amp; boarding. I had my customers bring their dogs to me, had two of my own &amp; would host up to 2 additional dogs (3 of they were from the same household). Puppies are EXTRA $$ because they require EXTRA attention.\n\nId get long term boarders &amp; that was really nice $.\n\nPlus, in San Diego &amp; Las Vegas, almost all of my customers always gave me a cash tip at the end of their stay.\n\nTIPS:\n- make sure your calendar is updated &amp; confirmed\n\n- respond to requests ASAP!!!!\n\n- be very communicative and honest\n\n- if you have pets, suggest a MEET &amp; GREET\n\n-Ask questions (i.e. is leash free dog park OK? Any special blankets/toys that they have to help them calm nerves? especially about the dogs preferences &amp; what they do in particular situations? Have they ever been left with a stranger, how did they react? ETC.)\n\n- SEND PIX &amp; VIDEOS intermittently throughout the day\n\n- complete REVIEWS asap, focus on the Positives of your experience with the Animal  &amp; their Human.\n\nRemember not only are these strangers trusting you with their Prides &amp; Joys, you are providing a Service.\nHope this helps.",

      "selftext": "Hey guys. I made a post a few weeks ago about automating the recycling at a restaurant. I can't link it because the automod removes it for having a link but I already automated a Mexican restaurants recycling by setting them up with the recyclers who automatically pick everything up once a week and I get to keep the money. My main job is to get rid of the cans if the truck doesn't show up. \n\nI went to the restaurant next door and asked the owner what they were doing with their recycling and they said they weren't bothering even to recycle. He accepted but the guy wanted me to come every other day to move bottles from one side of the building to the other so I said I couldn't commit to that but turns out the owner is opening a massive restaurant next week. A 100+ table giant German bar. He said I can set up the recycling for him there. I told him in return, I'll help him out a little with their social media posts. That was good enough for them.\n\nHe asked a few questions about how I do it but I kept it vague.\n\nIt so happens a very close friend is going to start working next week as the face of the bar and I already wanted to help him out anyway! I had already given him a ton of ideas and I can do the social media posts super fast and easy but to them they think I'm some sort of wizard lol. \n\nI may get another AUD $5,000 to $10,000 out of this one. This place is 5X bigger than the first restaurant. I'm now thinking of ways to also get their other restaurant by suggesting they drop the stuff at my bins. Just need to talk to the property owner to see if he's ok with the space situation. \n\nMan. At this point I think I'm going to hit every restaurant in town 😆. It's like shooting fish in a barrell. Nobody knows of this recycling scheme. I haven't seen any of the branded bins anywhere.",

Seriously.\n\nI’m 35. i quit my comfortable virtual assistant gig two yrs back to launch my Etsy shop which is all about bespoke, hand-dyed yarn. love the craft, hate the work.\n\nOld colleagues are talking promotions and investment properties. meanwhile I'm up at midnight, copypasting every question into a spreadsheet just to track custom orders. it's draining. I'm missing half the critical comms because they get swallowed by a hundred \"love this!\" comments.\n\nI think there's hope tho bcs i recently js finished a batch of 500+ requests last quarter. but unfortunately, overall revenue was flat bcs my fulfilment time is a joke and my customer service is trash. every day i use at least 4 hrs on managing accounts and not making product.\n\nHit my breaking point last week. a huge wholesale client’s order got completely buried, and I nearly tanked the deal. i was barely to save it but i desperately needed a change. i cant keep up with 2 phones and 3 notepads anymore it's too much manual work. ive been looking into automation stuff for streamlining my process and ive found 3 which r socialbu, hootsuite, and loomly.\n\nHere’s the plan moving forward:\n\nDitch the manual mess: no more jumping apps. priority is using a platform's unified inbox feature so all my interactions and comments from socmeds, etc., land in one spot. i can’t afford to miss another order.\n\nReclaim time: Taking back those four hours of time to focus on dyeing yarn and creating new listings\n\nLook into how and when to post: going to use the scheduling tools to make sure open shop announcements are actually consistent on all platforms\n\nIn dire need of insights from anyone abt what the current situation. Is the hole too deep now? Is goind back to a stanle job better? Thoughts?\n",

          "body": "It turns out that it's harder behind the curtain than it looks. I'll second what people are saying about hiring a virtual assistant, but I'll also say that it can feel like handing over part of the process is harder than just doing the work yourself. I always feel like if I just work harder, I'll get ahead of things, but everyday more things end up on my To Do List than I scratch off. But every day isn't like that, and you can get ahead of it. \n\nI've been in business for 20 years and here's what I've learned: \n\n1. Get really efficient, and efficiency doesn't always mean apps. Even after all these years, I use a paper To Do List. I write every single thing down on my list as part of the brain dump I do as I drink my coffee in the morning. This frees up the part of my brain I'd be using to remember all of the things. Twenty years of doing this and I still have a line item that says \"check client emails.\" It also helps me prioritize, follow up, and generally keeps me sane. Then I time box my day on a white board, grouping like things together for maximum efficiency. Most people will say that you should get an app or some other tech solution. I cringe, because I know that tech solutions take set up, remembering to input data, they're on tiny screens. If your latest app doesn't do the trick, go old school. \n\n2. \"Create in the AM, connect in the pm.\" Or whatever works for you. Use your own natural rhythm to be the most productive. And take a day off. Seriously. Just one. \n\n3. Think about hiring a college art student to help with the production. It can be easier to train someone to do that then wade through all of the emails and messages.   \n  \n4. Raise your prices. If you have too much work, raise them. You don't have to go crazy, but you'll make more/work less, and even an hour or two would make a difference at this point. This feels really hard, but it's about business, not your internalized feelings of value. \n\nThe hole is not too deep. Just keep swimming. All of this means you're growing, and these are the growing pains. You've got this!",

There is also a difference between ceremonial matcha and regular culinary grade matcha.\n\nOn top of that, a big reason good quality matcha is expensive is because the good matcha only comes from a particular environment that includes soil acidity, weather (including wind strength). It's very similar to wine grapes that require particular acidity and soil composition to be good.

Here are some of my faves from my SAHM category:\n\nReseller of vintage clothing, books, or something else niche. You go to thrift stores or garage sales or hit up FB marketplace, then resell on EBay. Pick something small and you can take the baby with you. \n\nGift Wrapper. Great time of year for this, and more specialized than you think. You learn the craft from YouTube then partner with small boutiques. Market yourself on Nextdoor. It may not work with the baby's schedule, but maybe. \n\nLaundry Service. Pick up/wash/fold/deliver people's laundry. This is a true hustle. Best if you live close to a wealthy neighborhood.\n\nMobile or Virtual Notary. Need to jump through the regulations first. \n\nPinterest Manager. Who knew there was such a thing? Apparently you create pins to drive clicks for businesses who don't have a Pinterest Manager. I was so baffled by this I actually researched this and did a step-by-step of everything that's involved. \n\nReclaimed yarn seller. I'm obsessed with this one currently. You thrift sweaters, unravel them, and then resell them on etsy. Believe it or not, it's a $6 billion industry. I'm working on this step by step because there's a lot to it (got to freeze the sweaters to kill any moths before unraveling).",

I am worried about money, but with the holidays coming up, I thought of offering gift wrapping services. I genuinely love wrapping gifts and decorating them and I frequently get compliments when giving gifts. I figured this type of service would be useful for parents who can be very busy this time of year. I would go to their home and wrap because I am sure people don't want to give their gifts to a stranger plus it would just be easier than transporting back and forth. I was thinking I'd post a flyer in local Facebook groups including some of the ones I've found babysitting gigs through. However, I haven't done anything like this before, and I'm not entirely sure how to work out some of the details.\n\nFirst, I am not sure how much to charge. I don't know if an hourly rate or charging per gift makes more sense - I am thinking an hourly rate would be better because per gift can get specific depending on size of gift. But idk how much to charge for an hourly rate? Is $40-50/hr with a one hour minimum a good rate? My mom originally said something significantly higher but I think at that point people would just wrap themselves. I want to make it worth my time but have no idea what the going rate for something like this would be. I live in a pretty high COL area and I make $25-30/hr babysitting (depending on # of kids) if that adds any context.\n\nSecond, should I tell parents that they must supply their own wrapping and decorating materials? And perhaps offer if they would like me to supply materials then it would be an additional $15-$20 flat rate added on to the hourly total?\n\nIs this a good idea, would this even be something that you think people would take advantage of? Any advice or changes you would make?",

I.e. through your babysitting? The other route could be offering more holiday baby sitting gigs.

One thing I'd recommend is provide your own wrapping paper, gift bags, bows, etc. Cheap paper can rip, and you wouldn't want get there to wrap and have them not have enough.   \n  \nCharge by the item. If you get fast, you make more money. Here is the suggested standard rate:\n\nStandard Market Rates:\n\n* Small Box (Jewelry/Phone): $4 - $6\n* Medium Box (Shirt/Shoe): $6 - $10\n* Large Box (Appliance/Boots): $10 - $15\n* XL/Odd Shapes (Bike/Guitar): $20+\n\nThe Hourly Breakdown: An experienced wrapper can wrap a medium box in 3 minutes.\n\n* *Rate:* $8 per box.\n* *Speed:* 15 boxes per hour.\n* *Revenue:* $120/hour.\n\n*Even if you are slow (10 mins/box), you are earning $48/hour.*\n\nCorporate Gifting (The Goldmine): Real estate agents and sales teams often give 50 identical gifts to clients.\n\n* *Job:* Wrap 50 bottles of wine.\n* *Rate:* $5/bottle.\n* *Time:* 3 hours.\n* *Total:* $250.\n\nMake sure you charge for rush jobs and the fact you're going to them. \n\nAnd reach out to Real Estate agents and other business people who commonly give gifts to their clients. \n\nGood luck!",

I end up with these terrible phone photos taken in my workshop with garbage lighting and cluttered backgrounds.\n\nI got tired of fighting with Photoshop and writing AI prompts from scratch every time so I started building an app that just does it for me. Take a photo of an object, pick a background, tweak the lighting, and it generates something that actually looks professional.\n\nStill working on it but it's getting pretty cool. I originally just wanted it for my own portfolio stuff but I keep thinking about how many people selling things online probably deal with the same issue. Not everyone has room for a lightbox or money to pay a photographer for every listing.\n\nAnyway it's not done yet but I'm getting close. Put up a waitlist if you want to know when it's ready.

You can tutor for foreign students who wants to learn English too. Bonus if you and your spouse wants a free vacation- teaching English in Japan or Korea. I know a few who did this for the summer to pay for grad school tuition. They loved it cause they can immerse in new culture, have a place to stay, it’s a working vacation that helps them pay for school. If your tech savvy, help senior citizens who needs help setting up their smart phone and helping teach them how to use it, teach them the basic of how to use their computer or emails. But to me staying at home and doing online teaching is the best. Set up a platform in Etsy and make teaching flash cards- my daughter did this. She spent a few hours in the computer doing pdf files people can download. Once she got it uploaded she left it alone til someone pays for it. It’s not much but she’s in high school and good enough for her to buy stuff she wants. \n\nWith pallets you will still need to put out some investment capital. Money begets money right. I’m just thinking of ways you can earn the money you want without upfront capital investment. In this day and age, you can literally sell ideas. Capitalized on that.

You get to choose what type of you want, tool, home goods, small appliances, it range in prices like 300-600 I think. The ones I checked out was a bunch of ryobi tools for 500.00 and bunch of small kitchen appliances and again for 500.00. You see it on fb marketplace and basically it’s in warehouses that you go to for pick up. They also have return good from Amazon, Walmart, Home Depot that are sold by the pallets. I see people resell them a lot on flea markets. But question to ask yourself is, do you have the space to store your inventory. If your going to resell it in person you also need to figure out your logistics, you mentioned you vehicle is on the older side. If you cannot unload your pallet inventory where are you going to store it? It’s an additional cost to you if you have to rent a truck or storage unit.",

Instead of bonuses you now get stars (donations) which no one pays, partnerships which is impossible if you’re not a typical influencer and subscriptions which again no one pays for. So why, if they’re not paying people for ads, is Facebook littered with ads?? It’s become more like an MLM these days selling random vapes and energy drinks. \n\nThen we have selling items. I used to have an eBay shop selling kids stuff. I made a few hundred a month. But now eBay is dead but the general market is so oversaturated. I moved to Etsy and started making things and wasted so much time and money because drop shipping and over saturation has ruined it. Also people just go straight to Temu and Etsy for disgustingly cheap stuff so no one wants to pay for your crafts. \n\nSo I’m looking into what’s the next thing and honestly it looks like nothing. All the social medias are being money grabbing af and making us rely on partnership ads or donations, online selling has been obliterated, you can’t even make an OF anymore because the hype has gone and people are basically doing it for free these days. Even if you have a specific skill AI will do it for free so no one will pay you. \n\nAnd before any investment bros be like you need to buy whatever stock or coin, no.

      "selftext": "So for the past 4–5 years, I've been searching for ways to make money both online and in person. I've tried just about everything you can think of: home services, website development, game development, tutoring, dropshipping, affiliate marketing, and a bunch of smaller hustles. By far, the best one I've tried so far is social media.\n\nA lot of people get pissed off that the video they spent hours working on flopped, but that ends up being their biggest mistake. Every social media platform literally shows you *why* your video didn’t perform well. It's right there in the analytics/metrics page. You just have to learn how to read the metrics and what numbers matter for going viral in your niche. Once I learned that, I started going viral with basically every video I made on TikTok.\n\nI found a niche of 2D simulation videos, and I decided to recreate them in 3D using the skills I developed from game development. I grew to 14k followers in my first month. Now I earn $1–3k per month by posting videos that take me about 15 minutes a day to make. (Yeah, it's not fully passive income, but once I post a video, it keeps earning as long as it gets views.)\n\nSo if you’ve read this far, my biggest piece of advice sounds corny, but it’s true: don’t give up so early. Try to learn what you did wrong and how you can improve. If you do that consistently, it would honestly be irrational for you *not* to succeed.",

I've also rented out some ad space for links (Yes this requires work but good to boost income when needed, Start page links i charge about 500€ per month, i rent out 2 spaces at most per month). rented ad space income is  7-10k € per year the past 7 years.\n\nI use free plans from Vercel, Prismic io and upstash so site hosting costs are literally 0.\n\nPlan was never to try to make money but learn to program, it was a bit of a happy accident and i slipped into the SEO world after learning that i need to put in some effort to rank for certain keywords.\n\nI consider this a passive income project today but i would also say that no project starts as passive project, you have to put in time very actively in the beginning to get it up and running.

      "selftext": "Most people treat LLMs like a toy. They get generic, robotic outputs because they use generic inputs.\n\nI spent the last few months reverse-engineering how top agencies and automated channels actually use AI. It’s not about the model, it’s about the **Context Injection**.\n\nI built a personal library of \"Mega-Prompts\" to handle my workflow. I’m sharing 3 of the most useful ones here so you can stop wasting time on bad outputs.\n\n# 1. The \"Objection Crusher\" (For Sales &amp; Negotiation)\n\n*Use this when a client or customer is giving you a hard time. It uses the \"Feel, Felt, Found\" psychological framework.*\n\n    TASK: Identify the top 5 objections a cynical buyer would have about [PRODUCT].\n    \n    EXECUTION: Write a \"FAQ\" section where you ruthlessly destroy these objections.\n    - Method: \"Feel, Felt, Found\" (Empathy -&gt; Bridge -&gt; Proof).\n    - Tone: Empathetic but firm.\n    - Format: Q: [Objection] A: [Response].\n    \n    [PRODUCT] = \"Your Product Here\"\n\n# 2. The \"Deep Dive\" Persona (For Marketing)\n\n*Stop guessing who your customer is. This prompt builds a psychographic profile better than most marketing agencies.*\n\n    TASK: Create a detailed User Persona for [PRODUCT].\n    \n    PROFILE:\n    1. Demographics: Age, income, location.\n    2. Psychographics: Fears, desires, secret vices.\n    3. A Day in the Life: Walk through their morning to night.\n    4. Where they hang out: Specific Subreddits, YouTube channels, Newsletters.\n    \n    [PRODUCT] = \"Your Product Here\"\n\n# 3. The \"Ghost Creator\" (For Content)\n\n*If you need viral scripts that don't sound like AI wrote them.*\n\n    ROLE: Act as a Viral Content Scriptwriter. You are an expert in narrative pacing and \"retention engineering.\"\n    \n    INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. The Hook (0-3 seconds): Create a 'Pattern Interrupt' hook. Do not start with \"Here is a story...\" Start in media res.\n    2. The Body: Use short, punchy sentences (max 12 words). Every 3rd sentence must introduce a new piece of info.\n    3. The CTA: End with a polarizing question.\n    \n    [TOPIC] = \"Your Topic Here\"\n\n**Why am I sharing this?** Because efficient prompting is the only skill that matters right now.\n\nI compiled my full list of 50 engineer-level prompts (including the \"Copywriting Assassin\" and \"Infinite Product\" frameworks) into a document called **The Phantom Protocol**.\n\nComment if you want to see the full list.\n\nHope this helps you hack the matrix.",

      "selftext": "Let me get started by saying it’s not easy until you find something you love. Yes, I still have a full-time job, a loving wife, cute kids, and mid-life crisis. The curiosity to make money online as a side hustle always annoyed me because of the sheer number of videos promising \"easy money.\"\n\n*Now pay up for my online course!* Joking :)\n\n# 2017 to 2021: Mobile Game Venture\n\nI love playing games—mobile, PC, or console. I was a big fan of hyper-casual games, and my interest really piqued when I saw titles like *Rider*, *Color Switch*, and other minimalistic games pop off. That’s when I started researching what I could use to develop a game myself.\n\n**Tools to develop and research** Yes, there are many tools to develop mobile games like Unity, Godot, and Game Maker. However, since I was lazy, I was mainly focused on executing the idea as soon as possible. I researched game engines that would allow me to \"code\" a game without actually using code.\n\nI came across an engine called **Buildbox**. Back then it was expensive (around $90 per month), but it was a tool that allowed me to easily make hyper casual games with drag-and-drop mechanics and export them directly to mobile apps.\n\n**The Idea** I made a list of around 20 games that were top of the charts at the time. I analyzed play time, control inputs, graphic styles, and game types. Again, being lazy, I didn’t want to design complex graphics, so I chose simple shapes.\n\nMy \"lazy genius\" brain came up with the idea to combine the *Snake* game from the Nokia era and *Color Switch* to make a game called **Snake vs Colors**. I developed the game in around 2-3 months with 50 levels and an endless mode.  \n[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snake-vs-colors/id1435037864](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snake-vs-colors/id1435037864)\n\n**Publisher vs. Publishing Yourself** After doing a bit of research, I realized how difficult it is to promote a game yourself when big publishers are spending massive amounts of money to promote free games. Hence, I decided to go for publishers. I found a few by checking the top charts of the Play Store and App Store.\n\n* **1st Publisher: Voodoo.** Their process is simple. They care about the retention of Day 1 and Day 7 players acquired via ads. They make you publish the game on the App Store to test metrics (Day 1 retention needs to be 55%, Day 7 needs to be 20%). They liked my game a lot, but even though it passed the retention test, they didn't publish it. Since it was built in Buildbox, we couldn't add the specific ad modules they required.\n* **2nd Publisher: Crazy Labs.** They were fairly new but had a hit called *Sausage Run*. We did the usual tests, and the game passed. I explained it was developed on Buildbox, but they loved the concept so much that they re-developed the game in-house using Unity. We signed a deal.\n\n**The Result:** The game was a success with around **1 million downloads in 1 month and 10 million downloads in total**, and at one point, it reached #1 on the US App Store chart for 1 day.\n\nThen comes the downside of free games. The publisher spends a lot of money acquiring users, and this is where the \"fake numbers\" come in. Even though the game was in the top 50 for 4-5 months, the money only started generating profit after 6 months.\n\n**Profit:** After 4 years, I made **$40k** (minus $500 for Buildbox and $100 for App Store fees).\n\n# 2021 - 2022: Crypto, NFTs, Meme Coins &amp; Leverage Trading\n\n**Just don't do it!** Highly risky.\n\nYou are basically in a casino hoping for a coin to go up, scamming other people to buy your shitcoin or NFT, or doing leverage trading where 99% of people lose.\n\nI can elaborate on this, but honestly, it was a waste of time. I got some valuable knowledge about coding, how blockchain works, and the potential of the technology. Unfortunately, I didn't buy Bitcoin.\n\n**Result:** Lost **$3k**.\n\n# 2023: YouTube Shorts &amp; Stock Investments\n\nGutted by the crypto loss, I started doing more research and created YouTube Shorts. I made around 5-6 videos using famous movie scenes with funny edits and emojis. One video worked out with around 50k views, but I didn't make any money and I didn't enjoy the process.\n\nI also started adding money to stocks. Since I work in tech, my main focus was investing in companies I know: Tesla, Palantir, Oracle, Nvidia, plus a daily $5 into an S&amp;P 500 ETF.\n\n**Result:** Over the past 2 years, I invested $15k. It is now worth around **$30k**.\n\n# 2024: AI Slop\n\nI made a Python app using AI. Honestly, I found that if you have basic knowledge of coding, you can get a lot done faster. I created many mini-projects: a kids' AI activity generator, a monster AI game, card games, a task list app with AI, a stock news aggregator, and an AI prompt scheduler.\n\nExample: [https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1axTug6Snx84uv5WY8C0pUEaVATYsKhMf](https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1axTug6Snx84uv5WY8C0pUEaVATYsKhMf)\n\nThis was just me testing the waters to see how much I could get out of AI. I tested all the models—Claude, Gemini, GPT. **Cursor** is amazing. **Ollama** allowed me to run models locally, which helped me customize the LLM and create custom models. AI image generation is a game changer e.g. Nano Banana, Midjourney.\n\nI believe with AI apps coming out on daily basis focus of solving the problem instead of trying to make something you like as a product.\n\n**Result:** Lost **$300** on monthly subscriptions for the models.\n\n# 2025: Back to where it started\n\nI am back to making games after 8 years lol. The kids are growing up fast, so I finally have more time on my hands.\n\nI love making games and the process of development, so I have started working on a new project. My plan is simple: make 2 games a year and release them on mobile with a fixed price (premium). Again, I am not planning to make money quickly, but to enjoy the process and spend more time doing something I love.\n\nHope this helps a few of you who are looking for some sort of guidance, as I see too many people trying to sell courses and crap on Reddit and YouTube.",

I have contractors that I work with that include maids, handymen, AC repair, electricians, painters, plumbers, a roofer, and appliance repair guys.

This was during Covid so the shift of traditional invite switched to digital heavily and people wanted to send out I bc it’s through WhatsApp or email. I started my shop in August 2020 and when I created the designs I felt looked good there wasn’t much traction. But when I explored what others made and the designs that sold, I tweaked my designs and started seeing 20-30 sales come through the very next month of starting. Then it gradually went upto 100 in a month with Etsy ads on plus SEO works and most most importantly creating original and good designs catering to market but consistently uploading everyday! \n\nI used tools like canva corjl to help with design and sell but they lacked a lot of things and through those pain points since 2023 me and my husband worked on our very own design and order management tool that helps digital Templet or Print on demand people sell their work on Etsy or other marketplaces with a better user experience. \n\nRight now I switched from wedding templets to baby shower ones as there’s a lot of demand there as well.",

      "selftext": "Started doing finance TikTok in February because everyone kept saying you can make money from it. I work at a bank doing loan stuff and figured I know enough about credit to post about it.\n\nCouldn't show my face though. Someone at our branch posted about mortgage rates on LinkedIn last year and got called into HR. It was generic advice but they freaked out. So yeah not doing that.\n\nFirst few months was just text over stock footage. Got like 180 views per video. Took forever to edit too. Tried filming my hands instead. Better but people kept commenting asking why I'm hiding.\n\nWas stuck at 600 followers in May for like 5 weeks. I was putting in 6 or 7 hours a week and nobody was watching. Stopped posting for two weeks because it felt pointless.\n\nPosted something in June about credit card payments and my chin was in the frame because I angled my phone wrong. That got 15k views. Everything else was under 1k.\n\nSo faces matter but I can't use mine. Tried some stuff in August. Nothing worked. Started using generated faces in September. CapCut for editing, APOB for the face thing, Descript for audio. Like $28 a month.\n\nViews went back up. Some videos get 2k, some get 8k. Had two hit over 15k in November. At 3200 followers now.\n\nCreator Fund was $38 in October. November was $118 because of those bigger videos. December is like $48 so far.\n\nBudgeting app reached out in November. $120 for two videos. Made them, got paid. They wanted more but I checked their reviews and it was 2.3 stars with people saying it charged them twice. Passed on that.\n\nCrypto company offered $180 for one video. Googled them and they got sued last year. Almost promoted a scam which would've been bad.\n\nSomeone DMed me two weeks ago saying my credit utilization video helped them go from 640 to 695 in four months. That felt better than the money honestly. Which sounds cheesy but whatever.\n\nTakes maybe 5 hours a week now. Writing scripts takes longest because I want it to be accurate. So many finance TikToks have wrong information.\n\nLast month was $238 total. This month probably under $85. Super inconsistent.\n\nFeels weird using a fake face. But everything else is real. My voice, research, scripts. Just not the face. Can't show mine without work issues and faceless content doesn't work.\n\nDon't know how to make this stable. Do I just keep posting and hope stuff hits? Try to figure out what goes viral? Post on other platforms? Idk.\n\nThe anonymous part works for what I need. Can talk about bank stuff without my manager seeing. But stuck at this income level where it's not enough to justify the time unless it grows.\n\nAnyone doing content where you can't show your face? How'd you get past the income being all over the place?",

Most people never get past a few hundred followers because they give up long before they hit the point where something finally works. You kept experimenting and you have a system now that brings consistent views even if the income swings month to month.\n\nThe fake face thing is not a problem. Loads of creators use avatars or generated faces because of jobs or privacy. The part that matters is your voice and the accuracy of your info. People can feel when someone actually knows what they are talking about and that is why your stuff is getting shared.\n\nThe money being unstable is normal on TikTok. If you want it to become stable you need to use TikTok as the top of the funnel and build something you own underneath it. That is where the predictable income comes from. Most faceless creators who make real money do something like:\n\nPost short videos regularly Build an email list or small community Link to something they control A digital product service or newsletter Long term that is what smooths the income\n\nYou already have the hardest part which is content that people trust. You can repurpose everything you make onto Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts with almost no extra work. Some creators get five times the reach just by posting the same clip in different places.\n\nYou are further ahead than you think. If you keep posting weekly and start building something you own in the background, you can turn the unpredictable income into something steady. The skill of making finance content that people understand is worth a lot more than one month of TikTok payouts.",

I'm sure there is some good advice on here, but it's buried under mountains of referral links and scams.\n\nHere's my advice and insight;\n- find a problem/ gap in the market, and fix it.\n- research your idea; is there a demand for your idea? Is the market over-saturated already? Don't waste time on something people don't need.\n- now you've found a problem, fixed it, created the product etc. But what if people can't find your product? You need SEO, make sure your product is discoverable. \n- niche and specific; specific industry, specific problem + solution. You're not trying to sell to billions of people.\n- time and patience; no true passive income stream is built overnight.\n\nIt's hard to be specific because it depends entirely on your interests and strengths. My passive income streams come from my hobbies/interests (like cars), things that I enjoy and know alot about and can see the gaps in that market. I don't like football, so I'll never be able to create passive income from football-related products.\n\nIt takes real time and effort (and intelligence, for that matter) to create truly passive income streams.",

Another long game option that can be really fun is starting a YouTube channel about things you are truly passionate about. With consistency of posting 1 video per week I’ve seen many creators get monetized in 3-6 months. Those are two of my fave as a person who has 6 online income streams. Hope this helps!",

Especially if you choose to operate remotely. So many people want a remote business but they think it’s just plug and play. If you want plug and play then go out on the field. Remote requires planning and execution, it also requires patience! You might not see results right away but within a couple months if you stick to it, the rewards will outweigh the hard work. Also if you can’t focus well enough then let go of the internet. Personally I have ADHD but I’ve been able to work on it through out the years. I’m still online but I’m also offline. If you suck at staring at a screen, that’s fine. You are masculine and you want to work with your hands, that’s all that means. Play to your strength. Everyone wants to live the digital nomad life but it’s not realistic for everyone. \n\nYou should try to acquire a digital marketing skill and setting up a fiverr account once you get good enough at fulfilling a specific gig. \n\nGood luck.",

      "selftext": "I asked this same question a year ago, and honestly… the online space is noisy.\nYou’ve got people promising overnight riches, and then others who make everything sound so technical you feel like you need a degree.\n\nHere’s what finally made things click for me:\n\n1. Pick one simple path and learn it properly.\nMost people fail because they try 5 different things at once. When I stopped jumping around and followed one system step-by-step, things actually started working.\n\n2. Get into a community where beginners are supported.\nThis was the biggest game changer for me. Having people show me what to do next saved me months of guessing.\n(I’m in one now that teaches content creation, how to get leads, and how to grow — honestly wish I found it earlier.)\n\n3. Start before you feel ready.\nYour first posts, first funnel, first whatever won’t be perfect. Mine definitely weren’t. But taking action is what builds momentum.\n\n4. Don’t overcomplicate it.\nYou don’t need fancy software or a huge budget. You just need clear steps and consistency.\n\nIf you’re brand new, something beginner-friendly like affiliate marketing or digital products is usually the easiest place to start. The key is having guidance so you’re not stuck watching 100 conflicting YouTube videos.\n\nIf you want, I can share the beginner-friendly setup I’m using now — it breaks everything down so simply that even I (with zero tech skills at the time) could follow it. Just ask.",

Not a jackpot, but hey, it’s something, and it counts.\n\nMost of the challenge was me:\n\n- Posting everywhere humans exist online,\n\n- Answering DMs like my reputation depended on it,\n\n- Testing what actually works,\n\n- Realizing that getting even one paying customer takes way more energy than I expected 😅\n\n\nHonestly, I learned a TON in just 24 hours. It was chaotic, slightly delusional at moments, and exhausting… but I’m glad I did it. I’m still pushing, still experimenting, and still figuring out what works.\n\nThanks to everyone who followed along, whether you cheered, joked, questioned, or quietly lurked... I appreciate it so much 😊\nThis was a wild little ride. Onward to the next step. 🙏🔥\n\nTL;DR: Didn’t hit $250, got 1 client, learned a lot, surviving the chaos, ready for round 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm pushing myself today to make $250 in 24 hours using only my skills, a digital product I created, and a few micro-services.\n\nI’m doing this to test my creativity, discipline, and ability to build income with what I already have.\n\nI’ll be sharing updates as I go. If anyone wants to see the digital product/service I created, or follow the challenge, I can DM it.\n\nAny tips or motivation is welcome and highly appreciated. I’m nervous but excited. 😅\n\nStarting now, the challenge will run for 24 hours.\n\n\n\n\n",

The pay is actually good, but the job is extremely demanding.\n\nThis year I traveled outside the country twice, and honestly, it changed everything for me. I’ve never really felt “right” living in the U.S.—just with how things are going here in general. But whenever I’m in other countries, I feel a sense of freedom, peace, and overall way better mentally. It wasn’t just because I was on vacation either; I’ve vacationed within the U.S. before, and it was never the same feeling.\n\nBecause of that, I’ve decided that by June 2026, I want to move out of the country. The only thing holding me back right now is that I have no idea where to start when it comes to earning income online.\n\nMy current plan is to keep working my job, take overtime when I can, and stack as much money as possible until next June. At the same time, I’m trying to learn a skill I can use to make online income or hopefully land a fully remote job.\n\nI’m mainly posting this to ask for advice from anyone who’s made the move abroad, or from people who earn income online consistently. If anyone is willing to talk about their experience or point me in the right direction, I’d really appreciate it.",

In growth years, you could return $50,000 on 10%, but in down years you could negatively draw on the principal. In this case, it's better to grab a little more during a high year to cover a lower year. I am not talking a lot, maybe if you spend $30,000 in the year, grab $40,000 and hold the extra $10,000 in something like SGOV (3 months treasury bills) where it's still growing, but you can use it as a means to not drain that principal.",

Just be cautious if anyone says an opportunity to earn passive income will be very easy. Expect to work hard to reach income goals, reduce your expenses as much as possible, and find something that can get you to your $800 goal. \n\nI don’t think anyone can really answer the path ahead for you, because everyone is different.

A deep scrape of 765 newsletter issues found 210 unique advertisers over 4 years. The most frequent categories overall were food and dining, media and news, non-profits, retail, and home services.\n\n*But the top ad slot told a different story:* real estate, medical and healthcare, and financial services dominated. These advertisers were local businesses with high lifetime value, like luxury realtors and plastic surgeons, and big corporations with real local footprints.\n\nThe kicker: just five advertisers bought more than half of all top placements in the newsletter’s history.\n\n**The bigger opportunity is simple:** Local ad markets are fragmented and underserved. If you build an audience with engaged local buyers, a handful of “linchpin” advertisers can carry most of your revenue.\n\n⏮️ *Start backwards.* Define your ideal advertisers, then program your content for the exact people those advertisers want to reach. Daily utility beats fluff: openings, closures, events, zoning news, school updates, traffic, weather, and quick profiles of small businesses.\n\n**The Ramen First Step:** Pick one metro under 500k people. Define three linchpin categories you’ll serve. For example - luxury real estate, elective medical, and wealth management. Publish fifteen straight weekday issues to show traction, utilize social media to get subscribers, then open up to advertisers once you cross 10k subscribers.\n\n***👉🏼 Check out*** [***TheRamenHustle.com***](http://theramenhustle.com/) ***for daily scrappy business ideas sent to your inbox.***\n\n",

      "selftext": "I’ve been running a couple of faceless accounts for a while and honestly… the hardest part wasn’t understanding the algorithm or finding a niche. It was creating enough content to stay consistent. I could edit, script, experiment, but not at the speed needed to grow multiple pages.\n\nTwo months ago I changed approach completely.\n\nInstead of making everything myself, I started using a massive library of ready-to-post faceless videos so I could finally test niches fast, post daily, and run multiple channels without burning out.\n\nI’m not here to hype anything. But for anyone building faceless brands, this is what genuinely shifted things for me:\n\n• I went from posting 3–4 times a week to 4–6 times a day • I could test multiple niches without worrying about editing • I recycled performing videos across TikTok, Reels and Shorts • I started a new faceless page and hit traction in the first week • I finally had enough content to schedule posts for days\n\nThe library I used includes 23,000 ready-to-post short videos split into 15 niches (mindset, luxury, business, aesthetic moods, fitness, motivation, etc). No face needed, no editing skills, no camera, just download and use.\n\nIf you’re working on faceless pages, this type of shortcut can honestly save you months. I know it would’ve saved me a lot of time if someone told me sooner.\n\nIf someone need the link 🔗 , I’ll be happy to share it and if someone have a similar esperience, I would love to hear about it.",

      "selftext": "from an inner circle of operator's who's been running Trustpilot prospecting since 2022. he doesn't want his exact niches leaked, so i'm giving you the system that works across any service niche.\n\n**you're spending $3k/month on Facebook ads trying to generate leads for your affiliate offers while qualified buyers with proven budgets are writing their pain on Trustpilot begging for someone to save them.**\n\nnot because you don't know how to run ads. because you're trying to create demand when demand already exists—it's just sitting in one-star reviews waiting for someone to scrape it.\n\nmeanwhile, affiliates who understand prospecting are pulling $20k-50k/month promoting high-ticket offers to people who already paid once and got burned.\n\nwhile you're optimizing ad copy, they're stealing clients from shitty agencies and service providers.\n\n## **what Trustpilot prospecting really Is For affiliates**\n\nthis isn't about building a service business (unless you want to). this is about finding the warmest possible leads for high-ticket affiliate offers—people who already have money, already have pain, and are actively looking for a solution.\n\n**the core mechanism:** Trustpilot reviews are public proof of budget + pain. someone who left a one-star review saying \"this agency took my $8k and disappeared\" is telling you:\n\n- they have $8k to spend\n- they're desperate for results\n- they're in buying mode right now\n- they're emotionally vulnerable (perfect for a strong offer)\n\nyou're not cold outreaching. you're responding to people who publicly announced they need help.\n\nthis works because most people don't think of Trustpilot as a lead database. they think it's a review site. but every negative review is a buying signal if you know how to read it.\n\n**the affiliate angle:** you're not pitching your own service (unless you have one). you're either:\n\n1. promoting high-ticket affiliate offers (courses, coaching, done-for-you services) that solve their problem\n\n2. positioning yourself as a \"consultant\" who recommends solutions (affiliate links)\n\n3. building relationships and monetizing with backend offers\n\nthe play is the same: find people with money and pain, offer them the solution, collect commissions.\n\n\n## **how to run trustpilot prospecting**\n\n**step 1: find service categories with angry buyers**\n\nyou want industries where:\n\n- people pay $3k-50k for services\n- results are hard to deliver (so there are plenty of bad reviews)\n- buyers are business owners or high earners (not broke consumers)\n\n**best categories for affiliate prospecting:**\n\n**digital marketing agencies:**\n- SEO agencies\n- Facebook ads agencies  \n- Google ads management\n- social media marketing\n\n**business services:**\n\n- web design/development\n- branding agencies\n- business coaches/consultants\n- lead generation services\n\n**financial services:**\n\n- credit repair companies\n- tax resolution services\n- bookkeeping/accounting\n\n**legal services:**\n\n- immigration attorneys\n- personal injury lawyers\n- business formation services\n\n**home services (high-ticket):**\n\n- roofing companies\n- HVAC contractors\n- solar installation\n\ngo to Trustpilot, search these categories, filter by \"1-star reviews\" from the last 30-60 days.\n\n**step 2: extract qualified leads from reviews**\n\nyou're looking for reviews that mention:\n\n- specific dollar amounts they paid\n- how long they've been struggling\n- what results they expected\n- emotional language (frustrated, desperate, angry)\n\n**perfect review examples:**\n\n\"Paid this SEO agency $6,000 for 6 months of work. Zero rankings, zero traffic. Complete waste of money. Do NOT hire them.\"\n\n\"Spent $12k on Facebook ads with [company]. They burned through my budget in 3 weeks with nothing to show for it. I'm about to lose my business.\"\n\n\"Hired [web design company] for $8k. Took 8 months, site doesn't even work properly. Still trying to get a refund.\"\n\nthese people have:\n\n- **proven budget** ($6k-12k they already spent)\n- **active pain** (still dealing with the problem)\n- **buying intent** (they'll pay again if you prove you're different)\n\n**what you're scraping:**\n\n- reviewer name\n- business name (if mentioned)\n- problem they paid to solve\n- amount they spent\n- date of review\n\nuse a spreadsheet. aim for 50-100 qualified reviews to start.\n\n**step 3: find them on social media**\n\nmost people use their real names on Trustpilot. finding them is easy.\n\n**search process:**\n\n1. copy reviewer name from Trustpilot\n\n2. search on LinkedIn: \"[name] + [industry keyword]\" (e.g., \"John Smith entrepreneur\" or \"Sarah Johnson ecommerce\")\n\n3. if not on LinkedIn, try Instagram, Facebook business pages, or Google\n\n4. find their business website if they mentioned a company name\n\n**you'll find 60-70% of them.** the ones you can't find, skip. don't waste time.\n\nlook for:\n\n- business owners (LinkedIn says \"Founder\" or \"CEO\")\n- active profiles (posted in last 30 days)\n- signs of revenue (team size, office photos, \"we're hiring\")\n\n**step 4: craft the outreach (empathy + proof + offer)**\n\nyou're not pitching. you're rescuing.\n\n**message structure:**\n\n**Line 1: Reference the review**  \n\"Hey [Name], saw your review about [shitty company]. That's brutal—$6k with zero results is exactly why people don't trust agencies anymore.\"\n\n**Line 2: Empathy + credibility**  \n\"I run [your thing / represent a service] and we specialize in cleaning up messes like this. Worked with 3 other businesses who got burned by [same problem].\"\n\n**Line 3: The offer**  \n\"Happy to do a free audit / 7-day trial / strategy call to show you what should've been done. No payment until you see [specific result]. If you're open to it, let me know—I'll send over some examples.\"\n\n**critical elements:**\n\n- acknowledge their pain first (don't pitch immediately)\n- differentiate yourself from who burned them (\"we're not like them\")\n- remove risk with free trial / guarantee / proof-first approach\n- keep it conversational (not a sales template)\n\n**if you're promoting an affiliate offer instead of your own service:**\n\nadjust line 2: \"I don't run an agency anymore, but I consult with businesses on [problem] and can recommend someone legit who won't waste your money.\"\n\nthen on the call, you pitch the high-ticket course/coaching program you're affiliated with as the solution.\n\n**Step 5: Follow Up Like Their Business Depends On It (Because It Does)**\n\nmost won't respond to message 1. that's fine. they're busy dealing with their disaster.\n\n**follow-up sequence:**\n\n**Day 3:** \"Hey [Name], not sure if you saw my message—figured I'd follow up since I've helped a few other businesses recover from similar situations. Let me know if you want to see what we did for them.\"\n\n**Day 7:** \"Last follow-up—if you're still dealing with [their problem], happy to hop on a quick call and give you a free game plan even if we don't work together. Worst case, you get clarity on what went wrong.\"\n\n**Day 14:** Send a case study or testimonial: \n\n\"Thought you might find this interesting—worked with another business owner who got burned by an SEO agency. Here's what we did to turn it around in 60 days: [link].\"\n\n40-50% will respond by follow-up 3 if your initial message was strong.\n\n**step 6: convert them with over-delivery**\n\nthese people don't trust anyone. your job is to over-deliver immediately.\n\n**on the first call:**\n\n- give them a free audit of what went wrong\n- show them exactly what the shitty provider should have done\n- present a clear plan with milestones and metrics\n- offer proof (case studies, testimonials, results from similar clients)\n\n**if you're promoting an affiliate offer (course/coaching):**\n\n- position it as \"the system I recommend to clients who've been burned\"\n- emphasize proven frameworks (not promises)\n- offer to stay involved as they implement (builds relationship for backend offers)\n\n**if you're selling your own service:**\n\n- offer a pilot project or 30-day trial\n- structure payment as: $X upfront for first 30 days, then $Y/month after results\n- over-deliver in month 1 so they never want to leave\n\n**conversion rate if you do this right:** \n\n40-60% of people who book a call will buy if you have a strong offer.\n\n---\n\n## **Proof: What This Actually Generates**\n\noperator running Trustpilot prospecting for digital marketing offers (Q4 2024):\n\n**$43,800 in commissions | 87 outreach attempts | 34 responses | 19 calls | 9 clients closed**\n\noffer: high-ticket SEO coaching program ($4,200 commission per sale) + recurring backend offer ($300/mo commission)\n\naverage time per prospect: 15 minutes (scrape review, find on LinkedIn, send message)\n\nconversion rate: 47% close rate from booked calls\n\ntimeline: first client closed in 11 days, scaled to 9 clients in 90 days\n\n**his Facebook ad campaigns during the same period?** $8,400 in commissions on $6,200 spend.\n\nTrustpilot prospecting: $43,800 revenue, $0 ad spend, 15 hours total work.\n\nthis isn't theory. this is what happens when you stop competing for cold traffic and start targeting people who already proved they have money.\n\n---\n\n## **how to get paid today**\n\nif you're selling your own service (or positioning as a consultant with done-for-you options), never do monthly retainers. get paid upfront or don't work with them.\n\n**why upfront crushes monthly:**\n\n**monthly retainer ($3k/mo for 10 months):**\n- client feels like they're renting you\n- they micromanage because they're \"paying you every month\"\n- they churn at month 3 when results slow down\n- you made $9k total\n\n**upfront payment ($25k for the year, 15% discount):**\n\n- client feels invested (sunk cost fallacy works in your favor)\n- they leave you alone because they already paid\n- they can't churn mid-way without losing money\n- you made $25k today\n\n**what you do with that $25k:**\n\n- reinvest in ads immediately\n- acquire 2-3 more clients this month\n- hire team members with their money\n- take bigger risks because you're playing with house money\n\n**cash today compounds. cash promised tomorrow bleeds slowly.**\n\n**how to pitch upfront:**\n\n\"Two options:  \n\n**Option 1:** $3,500/month for 10 months ($35k total)  \n**Option 2:** $27,500 upfront for the year (22% discount, same deliverables)\n\nMost clients go with option 2 because they lock in the savings and we can move faster without monthly billing cycles.\"\n\n60% will take the upfront option if you frame it as a discount + efficiency play.\n\n**if they can't pay upfront:**\n\n- 50% upfront, 50% at month 6\n- or don't work with them (they're broke or don't trust you)\n\nupfront payment filters out tire-kickers and gives you the cash flow to scale immediately.\n\n\n## ** what you need to run this**\n\n**prospecting:**\n\n- Trustpilot account (free)\n- spreadsheet to track leads (Google Sheets)\n- LinkedIn Sales Navigator (optional, $80/mo, makes finding people easier)\n\n**outreach:**\n\n- LinkedIn account with decent profile (so you don't look like a bot)\n- Instagram DM access (for people not on LinkedIn)\n- email finder tool if doing email outreach (Hunter.io, $50/mo)\n\n**offers to promote:**\n\n- high-ticket affiliate programs in your niche (ClickBank, JVZoo, private programs)\n- coaching/consulting offers with $1k-5k+ commissions\n- done-for-you services you can white-label or resell\n\n**tools:**\n\n- CRM to track conversations (HubSpot free tier, Notion, or even a spreadsheet)\n- Calendly for booking calls ($10/mo)\n- Zoom for sales calls (free)\n\n## **you'll keep spending $2k-5k/month on Facebook ads hoping to generate leads while qualified buyers sit on Trustpilota**\n\nwriting detailed descriptions of their problems and budgets.\n\nyou'll compete with 10,000 other affiliates for cold traffic while someone else is DMing your dream clients directly.\n\nyou'll wonder why your close rate is 8% when it could be 50% if you were talking to people who already proved they'll pay.\n\n**Trustpilot prospecting isn't a hack. it's basic prospecting with a database no one thinks to use.**\n\nthe affiliates making $50k-100k/month aren't smarter than you. they just stopped competing where everyone else is competing and started fishing where the fish are actively biting.\n\n**if you're not willing to spend 2 hours scraping reviews and sending 20 messages, stay on the Facebook ad treadmill and accept your 2x ROAS.**\n\nbut if you're ready to target buyers who already have money and pain, this is the exact system.\n\n\n",

      "selftext": "if you're still \"researching niches\" 3 months in, you're not researching—you're avoiding the part where people can reject you. this breakdown is for affiliates ready to pick an offer and start driving traffic today.\n\n\nyou're spending weeks picking the \"perfect niche\" while affiliates who started yesterday are already collecting commissions.\n\nnot because they're smarter. because they understand something you don't: \n\nniche selection for affiliates isn't about passion or expertise. it's about finding where desperate buyers are already spending money, then driving them to existing high-converting offers.\n\nyou don't need to create products. you don't need to be an expert. you need to find traffic, match it to offers, and collect commissions.\n\nwhile you're watching \"find your passion\" videos, operators are running traffic to proven offers in niches they don't give a shit about and printing money.\n\nWhat Niche Selection Really Means For Affiliates\n\nforget everything you've heard about \"following your passion\" or \"building authority.\"\n\nas an affiliate, your niche is just: a group of buyers + problems they'll pay to solve + existing offers that convert.\n\nyou're not building a brand. you're not becoming an influencer. you're connecting people who have problems with solutions that already exist, and taking a cut when they buy.\n\nunderstanding the rule here : find where money is already flowing, insert yourself into that flow, redirect traffic to high-converting offers.\n\nthis works because you're not convincing anyone to buy something new. you're showing people who are already buying the specific solution they're already looking for.\n\nmost affiliates overcomplicate this. they think they need to \"create content in their niche\" for months before promoting. wrong. you need to identify buyer intent, drive traffic, and start testing offers this week.\n\nThe Affiliate System: pick your lane In 30 minutes not 30 DAYS.\n\n-step 1: identify proven affiliate niches (10 minutes)\n\ndon't brainstorm your interests. start with verticals where affiliates are already making money.\n\nhigh-converting affiliate verticals:\n- health/weight loss(supplements, programs, coaching)\n- make money online (courses, tools, systems)\n- relationships/dating (programs for men, programs for women)\n- finance(credit repair, investing, debt solutions)\n- parenting(education, behavior, development)\n- survival/prepping (emergency supplies, training)\n- hobbies with obsessed buyers (golf, fishing, woodworking)\n\ngo to ClickBank marketplace. sort by gravity (number of affiliates making sales). anything above 50 gravity = proven money flow.\n\ngo to MaxBounty, CrakRevenue, MaxWeb. look at featured offers. if a network is pushing it, affiliates are converting it.\n\npick 3 verticals where offers pay $100+ per conversion and have gravity above 30. that's your shortlist.\n\nstep 2: validate traffic sources exist (10 minutes)\n\nyou can have the best offer in the world but if you can't drive traffic, you're broke.\n\nfor each vertical on your shortlist, check:\n\nFacebook/Instagram:\n- search hashtags and keywords\n- do posts get engagement?\n- are there active groups/communities?\n- can you run ads without getting banned? (make money and dating = harder, health and parenting = easier)\n\nGoogle/YouTube:\n- search \"[niche] + problem\"\n- are people creating content?\n- high search volume = high buyer intent\n\nReddit:\n- are there active subreddits?\n- are people asking for solutions?\n- can you post without instant bans? (check subreddit rules)\n\nNative Ads (Taboola/Outbrain):\n- do fear/curiosity headlines work in this niche?\n- health, finance, survival = native ad goldmines\n\nif you can't find clear traffic sources, kill that vertical. doesn't matter how good the offer is if you can't get eyeballs.\n\nstep 3: match problems to existing offers (10 minutes)\n\ndon't create products. find problems people are already paying to solve, then find offers that solve them.\n\ngo where your potential buyers are:\n- Facebook groups\n- Reddit threads  \n- YouTube comments\n- Amazon reviews of competing products\n\nlook for repeated complaints:\n- \"I've tried everything and nothing works\"\n- \"I don't know where to start\"\n- \"this is too complicated\"\n- \"I need this to work fast\"\n\nthese are buying signals disguised as frustration.\n\nnow go back to ClickBank/MaxWe, use ChatGPT or  google to find offers. find offers that directly address these exact complaints.\n\nexample:\n- complaint: \"I can't stick to meal plans, they're too complicated\"\n- offer: \"5-Minute Keto Meal Plans For Busy Moms\" ($120 commission)\n\nthe offer already exists. the buyers already exist. you're just the bridge.\n\n\nThe 48-hour validation test for affiliates\n\nmost affiliates waste months building \"content strategies\" before promoting anything.\n\nfuck that. test offers immediately.\n\nvalidation test structure:\n\nDay 1: Build Your Test Funnel\n\n- create simple pre-lander on Carrd ($19/year) or ClickFunnels (free trial)\n- headline: call out the exact pain you found in Step 3\n- 2-3 paragraphs agitating the problem\n- CTA button to affiliate offer\n\ntotal time: 2 hours max\n\nDay 2: Drive 100-200 Clicks\n\n- Facebook group posts (if allowed)\n- Reddit comments with value + link\n- Instagram story swipe-ups (if you have 10k followers)\n- $50 Facebook ad test\n- $50 native ad test\n\ntrack everything:\n- clicks to pre-lander\n- clicks to offer  \n- conversions\n\nWhat Validates:\n\n- 5%+ CTR from pre-lander to offer = strong pain-to-solution match\n- 1+ conversion in 200 clicks = offer converts, scale traffic\n- 0 conversions but 10%+ CTR = offer is weak, test different offer\n- 0 conversions, low CTR = pain angle is off, rewrite pre-lander\n\nif you get a conversion in your first $100 spend, you found a winner. pour gas on it.\n\nif you don't, you learned what doesn't work in 48 hours instead of 3 months. kill it and test the next vertical.\n\n\nPick your niche based on data, not feelings\n\nafter testing 2-3 verticals, choose the one where:\n\n1. offers convert(you got sales or strong CTR to offer)\n2. traffic is accessible(you can drive 500+ clicks/day without breaking the bank)\n3. commissions are worth it ($80+ per conversion minimum)\n\nthat's your niche. not because you love it. because the data says buyers exist and offers convert.\n\n-you don't need to be passionate about weight loss to promote weight loss offers.\n\n-you don't need to care about golf to drive traffic to golf training programs.\n\n-you need to drive traffic, generate conversions, and collect commissions.\n\nAvoid these affiliate niche traps\n\n-trap 1: picking niches with no proven offers\n\n if ClickBank has zero offers in your niche with 30+ gravity, move on\nno existing affiliates making money = you're pioneering, not profiting\n\n-trap 2: choosing niches where traffic is expensive/banned\n\ncrypto, CBD, adult = higher conversions but constant ad account bans.\nunless you have experience, start with easier traffic (health, parenting, hobbies).\n\n-trap 3: promoting offers that pay less than $50/conversion\n\n low commissions mean you need massive volume to profit.\n$10 per sale on a 2% conversion rate = you need 1,000 clicks for $20.\n$150 per sale on a 2% conversion rate = you need 100 clicks for $300.\n\n-trap 4: waiting to \"build authority\" before promoting\n\n you're not a content creator, you're a trafficker\nrun ads, test offers, collect data—authority is irrelevant\n\n-trap 5: switching niches every week\n\ncommit to one vertical for 30 days minimum.\ntest 5+ offers, 10+ traffic sources, 20+ angles.\nmost affiliates quit right before they find the winning combo.\n\nThe 30-Day Commit: What Actually Happens\n\nyou're not \"building a niche\" for months. you're testing aggressively for 30 days to find what prints money.\n\nweek 1: rapid testing\n\n- test 3 offers in your chosen vertical\n- drive 200 clicks to each ($150-$300 total spend)\n- find which offer converts best\n\nweek 2: angle testing\n\n- take winning offer, test 5 different pain angles\n- same offer, different messaging\n- find which angle gets highest CTR + conversions\n\nweek 3: traffic scaling\n\n- take winning offer + winning angle\n- test 3 traffic sources (Facebook, native ads, YouTube)\n- find which source is profitable\n\nweek 4: scale profitable combos\n\n- double down on: winning offer + winning angle + winning traffic source\n- kill everything else\n- optimize for EPC and conversion rate\n\nby day 30, you know:\n\n- which offers convert for you\n- which pain angles resonate  \n- which traffic sources are profitable\n- what your EPC and conversion rates are\n\nmost affiliates never get here because they never committed to 30 days of actual execution.\n\naffiliate partner who followed this exact process (September 2024):\n\nday 1-7: tested 3 ClickBank offers in survival/prepping niche\n \nday 8-14: found winner (emergency food storage program, $180 commission), tested 5 angles  \n\nday 15-21:winning angle = \"food shortage fear,\" tested Facebook + native ads  \n\nday 22-30: scaled native ads to $300/day spend\n\nresults after 30 days:\n\n$6,840 in commissions | $2,100 ad spend | 38 sales | 4.2% conversion rate | $3.26 EPC\n\nhe didn't know shit about survival. he just found where money was flowing and got in the way.\n\nStart Today:\n\nstep 1: pick vertical (today)\n\n- go to ClickBank, sort by gravity\n- choose vertical with 10+ offers above 50 gravity\n- commit for 30 days, no switching\n\nstep 2: find 3 offers to test (today)\n\n- filter by commission $80+\n- read sales pages, find best converting hooks\n- grab affiliate links\n\nstep 3: build test pre-lander (today)\n\n- Carrd or ClickFunnels\n- headline = main pain point\n- 3 paragraphs agitating pain\n- CTA to offer\n\nstep 4: drive first 200 clicks (days 1-2)\n\n- $50 Facebook ad test\n- $50 native ad test\n- free: Reddit + Facebook group posts\n\nstep 5: analyze data (day 3)\n\n- any conversions? scale that offer\n- high CTR, no conversions? test different offer\n- low CTR? rewrite pre-lander\n\n",

      "selftext": "Another month, another update for my tool site [terrific.tools](http://terrific.tools/) \\- here's the [previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1ov6wz9/im_building_a_tool_site_month_11_update/) one.\n\nI've now worked on this project for 12 months. And a wild 12 months it has been. \n\nMy initial insight when starting the tool site was two-fold:\n\n1. I found many tool sites, like Omni Calculator, getting millions of views every month. While many of them benefit from years of acquiring backlinks for free due to ranking highly, I figured that over time there'd be enough opportunities to catch up.\n\n2. I knew from my old blogging days that making money via display ads could be very lucrative, even though tool sites normally get lower RPMs (cause people don't scroll as much and just use the tool). \n\nWhen I first started terrific tools, the goal was to monetize it via a file converter app as well as those above-mentioned display ads. \n\nAnd November 2025 was the first full month where I just did that. \n\nSo how did the site do?\n\nIt made $174.41 from Mediavine/PubNation display ads and $125 from the sale of the desktop app, so close to $300. Not too shabby! \n\nAds started out a little disappointing as I was just onboarded to Mediavine. However, in the last week or so, I've gotten closer to my target session RPM of $10 (December's session RPM so far is $6.89). \n\nStill some way to go but at least, assuming traffic demographics remain consistent, there's a pathway to $10 RPM.\n\nTraffic-wise, not much has changed unfortunately. Last 30d traffic is at 26k users, 34k sessions, and 41k page views. \n\nSeems as if right now I am being targeted by some bot traffic because China and Singapore entered my top 5 highest traffic countries. \n\nAll of that said, I haven't released any new tools for the main site in a while since our startup (https://genviral.io/, feel free to check) is currently taking up 99% of my time. Made a few improvements to the desktop app, mainly for myself, as I needed those conversions. \n\nFor now, I'll probably just use the profits from terrific tools and invest it into backlinks and YouTube sponsorships (once the desktop app is a bit more mature). \n\nI always maintained that this could be a $10k/m project down the line. However, for that to be a reality, I need to significantly increase current traffic, probably by 20x-30x. \n\nAnd since this was always a long-term (&gt; 5 years) play, I'm prepared to be patient.. :)",

Half the time, it is just bots skewing the picture, and it throws off any sense of what is actually working. The long term view you have feels right, though. Tool pages can take forever to settle into stable rankings, especially when each one behaves like its own little ecosystem. When you get back to building more tools, it might help to look at how users actually move through the ones you already have. Sometimes a small internal link tweak ends up doing more than a big push for backlinks. Curious if you have noticed which tools hold people the longest.",

      "selftext": "I started my first business in 2010, and have gone from having about a thousand bucks in my bank account to a paper net worth in the low nine figures (though this will come down to high eight figures after taxes). Here's my advice FWIW:\n\n**1. Learn technical skills.** Unless you're an artist or a restauranteur or something like that, odds are that the majority of your work is going to be done on a computer. As such, you should master keyboard shortcuts, use multiple monitors, set up your workspace in an efficient way, learn basic coding skills (Javascript, HTML, and SQL are all you really need), know how to model things out in spreadsheets, etc. These skills have been instrumental to me in everything I've done as an entrepreneur, and without them there is absolutely no way I would have succeeded. One of my earliest memories of my first business was a friend asking me how I was making money (he was trying something similar and failing); I could see that a lot of the reason he was failing is that he couldn't handle any of the technical aspects of what he was doing himself (eg building a website), and so was paying for someone else do do a third-rate job of it. I said \"learn how to code\" and he responded with \"but that's too hard.\" Yes, learning new things is hard, and he also should have learned how to code. Which brings me to...\n\n**2. Suck it up and do the hard things.** The vast majority of people give up when they hit their first wall. Another huge chunk drop off after the second, third, or fourth. The people who succeed are the ones who suck it up and power through the shitty parts of entrepreneurship (and it's mostly shitty at the start). I learned this during the first year of my third business, and I'm learning it again now as I'm trying to get my philanthropic efforts off the ground: there is just so much stuff when you're starting out that's a pain in the ass, and there's no one to do it but you. If you can muster the mental fortitude to just make yourself do those things, you will separate yourself from 99% of the competition and massively increase your odds of success. As just one example: can you even *imagine* how difficult it must have been to sell books on the internet in 1993? Jeff Bezos must have literally run into thousands of pain-in-the-ass things, any one of which would have deterred a normal person, but he kept at it and now he's Jeff Bezos.\n\n**3. That which gets measured gets improved.** I have kept a side scrolling daily spreadsheet of my company's P&amp;L every single day going back to 2010. If I determine that something is critical to my company's success, I carefully measure it over time, and take note of any initiative that moves the numbers in a positive or negative direction. Even if you're just starting out and there's not much to measure, measure it. Make it a habit. While it's possible to drown yourself in data overload, I think it's much more common for people to be deficient in their data gathering and analysis than to take it too far.\n\n**4. Practice good manners.** It's crazy to have to write this one out, but I can't tell you how many people I come across that don't do this. If someone emails you, respond quickly. If they help you, say thank you (in fact, I recommend signing off on all your emails with \"Thanks, \\[First Name\\]\"). If they ask for a favor that's easy for you to deliver, do the favor. Follow up with people after a good conversation. Remember to always speak to what the *other person* wants, not just what you want. (That's another head-scratcher: the number of people who will say \"Hey Chris, it would really help me if you do X and Y\" without even considering what I want or whether it's in my interest to do what they're asking.)\n\n**5. Be obsessed with your business.** I recently stepped away from my company and handed the reins over to the management team. One of the major differences I've noticed in how they do things vs how I did things is that I was *obsessed* with the business, and they're not (somewhat understandably, obviously, as they don't have my equity stake in it). When you're obsessed with your business, things don't catch you by surprise because you were already worried about them way before they happened. When you're obsessed with your business, you always have a dozen ideas ready to go whenever resources free up. When you're obsessed with your business, you become the ultimate expert at the company across a variety of topics, and can be an invaluable resource to employees / teammates. Get obsessed.",

It really boils down to going from \"Execute ASAP\" to \"Medium term strategy and operations\".\n\nIf could add a point to your list - I would expand around \"Build a Process-Oriented Business\". Meaning that you are only as good as your documentation and processes for long-term scalability.\n\nIt's easy to know how to do most everything yourself at first (cause you built it), but building a process allows you to more easily slot in hires and make sure that the business can operate without you needing to be involved in every step.",

When sales people run companies they are able to go and sell investors, and get the money. But they don't know how to deliver.\n\nFor example, Elizabeth Holmes. She was able to go and raise the money. The product didn't work and now she's in jail.\n\nWhen technical people run the company, they can build a great product, and it can be sometimes hard to sell.\n\nThe biggest problem for technical people is getting out of speaking technical language and speaking the language of your audience.\n\nExecutives are speaking in a different high level jargon. A blue collar tradesperson is speaking a different language.\n\nGetting onto the wavelength of your customer requires a different set of emotional intelligence skills.\n\nHowever, what I've found is when you are onto something, selling becomes a heck of a lot easier. When you know who your customer is, suddenly they are listening on the end of the line, and willing to give you their time.\n\nWhen you are after the wrong customer, you are finding it hard to keep the person on the other line interested.\n\nWith that in mind, take a look at the pitch for my company (I have my sales hat on right now):\n\n[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fan-\\_3yDkIaTVCYIqRvXXNKcemRkrEzZ/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=112021489972476333242&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fan-_3yDkIaTVCYIqRvXXNKcemRkrEzZ/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=112021489972476333242&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true)",

Finally tapped out and decided to coach other crazies instead of going for another loop. \n\nJust remember, the irrational optimism that causes you to start a company is also the thing that can cause you to ignore the biggest issues with your company. Hope is not a valid business strategy. \n\nGood luck!",

I'm not a huge fan of Universities today but there's a handful of geniuses in the field of business who practice what preach and preach because they practiced. Some of the online personas are helpful like Hormozi, Gary Vee, but still a lot of what they do is to keep engagements for their own brands and/or sell things. I'd start reading books by genius professors, I'm bias, because that and value investment books are largely the only things I've read but it provided me deep insight into utilizing my endless idea generation, in refining and testing ideas, choosing the \"all-in\" and eventually seeing everything through in the real order things need to be done in.\n\nFor example: you could write a decent business plan, do tons of research on competitors, build a prototype, start networking with investors, start looking for team members &amp; the list goes on. Without a framework for focus and prioritization your business can easily become a mess, regardless of your plan. I'd check out Nathan Furr's books Nail it then Scale it or Innovators Method. If you want to create better ideas/businesses, I'd suggest something like innovators solution by Clayton Christensen, although the ideas are complex and he's heavy on business terminology (hard read but very valuable).\n\nI read a book weekly now to ensure I'm always learning and staying intellectually honest.",

      "selftext": "Give it to me straight, guys.\n\nI’m 25. Most of the people I went to high school with are planning weddings, having a nice a job or climbing a corporate tree or whatever. meanwhile, I’ve spent the last 8 years in my room learning music production, Svelte, Python, Django, and now LangGraph/LangChain which took a lot of time and energy but i loved every bit of it.\n\nI don’t have a degree. I don't have a girlfriend. And right now, I’m broke.\n\nLast month, I finally launched the MVP of my first serious startup, I poured everything into it. it got 15 free signups. and $0 Revenue\n\nI honestly fell into a depression. I tried to fix it by doing manual cold outreach (pitching via DMs/Email). It didn’t work obviously, because you need volume for that, and I was doing it by hand. I got depressed again.\n\nThen i realized I can't hide behind the code anymore. I have to become a marketer. I’m committing to turning on the camera and building a personal brand on Twitter to drive traffic. I’m also polishing a second app to handle the social media side, while flowjoy handles the search/text side\n\nMy Plan Moving Forward:\n\nStop crying about being 25 and got nothing to show for it\n\nuse my own tool to handle the SEO/Reddit grunt work.\n\nlaunch the my second app to handle instagram/youtube/tiktok.\n\nget on camera and document this messy journey.\n\nThis life feels like a rollercoaster and i don't know if it's just me or is it like this for everyone",

It can completely, absolutely change your life. I mean it. Especially someone that's competent in what they do. \n\nFind someone that does marketing while you take care of the tech and some business side. Two cofounders often make a far stronger case when it comes to networking (which you need lots of times), and it's generally a far better workflow than being solo. Solo is doable but ive only seen it done by people who are truly a spark in the dark. Two is often much better, also just because of the workload. \n\nFocus on doing your things right each and you might actually get things going well. \n\nSeparately, if you can't get a quality cofounder (better someone with quality than someone that is clueless and will just take away more years or months...) then try working with a startup even if you're not paid that much to start but make sure they have grit and can get things going. This is so you can build experience in the startup scene. Takes away a lot of the imagination as well. Then whenn you go find your cofounder make sure they've also been similarly involved. Either cofounded something successful or something alike. You might even consider working with someone significantly older if that's the case. Younger successful founders are way harder to come by and will likely only jump on your boat if you're something like them. So just get started with the rigjt people first. A company isn't 1 person. Gotta start somewhere. \n\nMy 2 cents good luck stay positive",

My most recent mobile apps (that I developed in the late 2010s) used Machine Learning and Augmented Reality and they still failed for the most part.  I figured if I can't make a profit using the most cutting edge technologies, I might as well move on to another industry.  I used to make a decent profit in the early 2010s, but at this point it's become impossible.  Or if an app is successful, it's usually only very briefly and then the revenue stops.  So I've been developing a video game for almost 6 years now, and hope to release it by the end of next year.  And hope to release it for many many platforms at a high price, and that should do the trick.

Fail forward. \n\nI remember reading in a book on entrepreneurship decades ago about how the average entrepreneur must endure the process of failure some 7 times on average until they find their first win.\n\nYou have accumulated vast knowledge and you are only now testing it in the marketplace, but you are still very young, don't despair.\n\nSylvester Stallone put his heart and soul into Rocky and was rejected 1500 times. He kept going.\n\nThe process with entrepreneurship is something like the 'spaghetti method' - throw enough spaghetti against the wall and something will stick.\n\nI think of dual track development from Software Engineering... that is, you have an ideation track - come up with ideas, produce a low cost PoC... test it and decide keep it or kill it. If you keep it, turn out an MVP (minimum viable product) and test in the marketplace. Do it at low cost and keep going until you get something worth keeping.\n\nMy old friend told me that an entrepreneur is someone who goes out hunting and shoots his gun in ten different directions... if something falls out of the sky, he runs towards it.\n\nThe trick is not to go broke trying... each failure costs money and takes its toll not only financially but on your mental health, emotions, nerves and self-esteem. \n\nAll successful entrepreneurs follow the same bumpy, often heartbreaking road. The trick is to iterate quickly and at low cost.\n\nYou are doing it right - failing forward. That's how you learned to ride a bike... you kept falling until you didn't. It's the only way.\n\nGood luck OP. You are doing fine.   \nYou can always sell your freedom to a day job with your skill set and do side hustles. That's how I got 'here'. LoL",

My wife and I were on vacation last month playing mini golf with the kids, and I had this random thought - I wonder what it actually costs to own one of these places.\r\n\r\nI started researching when I got home and went down a serious rabbit hole. Turns out mini golf course for sale pop up regularly, especially older mom-and-pop operations where the owners are retiring. The listings are all over the place though - some want $500k for a full setup with land, others are just selling the equipment and obstacles for way less.\r\n\r\nThe real eye-opener was learning about startup costs if you wanted to build from scratch. You're looking at easily $100k-300k depending on the size, and that's before you factor the land, permits, insurance, all the boring stuff. Even used obstacles and equipment aren't cheap when you need 18 holes worth.\r\n\r\nI spent weeks looking at everything - franchise opportunities, independent courses, even what it would cost to buy obstacles separately and piece something together. I found some interesting options through commercial equipment suppliers, auction sites, and even saw mini golf course equipment on wholesale platforms like Alibaba while I was comparing prices internationally.\r\n\r\nHaven't pulled the trigger on anything obviously, but I am genuinely surprised by how much goes into these businesses. Seasonal revenue in most places, maintenance cost, competition from other entertainment options. It's not the simple passive income situation I imagined.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone here actually own or run something like this? Is it as much work as it seems, or am I overthinking it ?\r",

          "body": "First off you need to separate real estate from business.  Its completely different  as its an appreciating asset.  Figure out the mortgage cost down payment, insurance and stuff then figure out a lease rate for that and lease it to the company.   This is how everyone does it.  Also it takes out a huge number from the equation and makes it all make sense.    You're likely going to sell that land to a developer or something down the road anyways.\n\nThen you can figure out the actual mini golf business.  Tons are popping up around me catered to adults as like a bar.  Mainly indoors and cool, think axe throwing but mini golf.  Sweet concept because not only are you making $15+ per person on golf but you're making that per drink.  Also you're open during the day for kids.  10AM-2AM seems like a great business model to me.   Much of it is normal putt putt with some cool woodworking, off the wall concepts like plinko, the idea is more fun interesting vs actually winning.  \n\nI know its not your concept but I'd lease an old abandoned warehouse thats beat up but in a cool part of town for cheap,  spend 100k fixing it up with cool lighting and weird designs, another 100k in awesome bar and tables and kitchen then 100k in the putt putt course.  Setup for daytime kiddo stuff then nightime hipster place with cool golf themed drinks and just collect the cash.\n\nHave killer apps and desserts and mocktails for the kids with everything $10-20.  Get huge frozen daiquiri machines that look super awesome and have one for kids and another for adults that they HAVE to get with fancy glasses like maybe they look like golf balls or putters or something.  no real food and all small apps like mini pretzel bites and tots but they're high quality amazing so people want to keep coming back just for the food or drinks",

You need to make it more than just a mini golf spot. Are there minor sports teams/ kids leagues you can sponsor? Are there any post-secondary / high school institutions you can offer discounts to , maybe this can drive traffic from friend groups and first dates? \n\nOne thought that comes to mind is that the most successful mini golf courses in my hometown were near restaurants that were popular for families with children.

This would keep things fresh and more interesting to locals.\n\nMaybe even have a web based designer where people can create and submit designs that the public votes on for upcoming seasons. Then three of the holes are selected as the winning community designed holes. You could even have a digital twin of your course that people can play online, with full leaderboard, and all that, people love competition.\n\nBottom line is, outside of tourist locations,I think the local public needs to be more involved somehow for a mini golf place to really be a long-term hit.",

      "selftext": "Long story short, I started my business 10 years ago with a little less than $2k to my name. My original goal was just to overtake my earnings at the time of $40k/yr. In the beginning things were rough... real rough. My first 3 months were crickets drawing my bank account down to cents.. Fast forward to the 4th month and I finally got a client. Because I was so young, my overhead was minimal so one client got me by. To not bore you will my life story, I have grown the business to \\~$1M annually without taking on any outside money. The ride has been wild and I no longer perform the actual service that we offer. I have figured out how to scale a rather unscalable business in a way that really nobody else has figured out. Here is the thing... the burnout I feel is debilitating to the point where it is hard for me to get through my days. I really used to love what it is we do and to my knowledge we are the only ones doing this at this scale without private equity or VC. All of this said, I know I am leaving TONS of $$ on the table and really no matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to build what needs to be built in order to scale further. This is part of the debilitation that I feel. I have swung 40 times (thats an exaggeration) and stuck out for one reason or another. Whether it is I don't have enough money to build it or I find somebody that says they can build it and they can't. I hate the feeling of being lost or without direction and really I am starting to actually lose my damn mind. The worst part is it is only me at the top and I have nobody to really talk to about all this. Running solo in the desert trying to find rain clouds and for whatever reason I just keep finding salt flats. Advice?\n\n  \nEDIT, UPDATE &amp; ANSWERED QUESTIONS: The business is a private chef business located in Austin, Texas. When I started, I was cooking at the best restaurant here at the time that is named Odd Duck. It was grueling work and I was not getting paid for my time like I thought I should have been. Anyways, one day I was cleaning up the grill station and a couple across the open kitchen bar asked me if I would be interested in doing a dinner party for them. I said \"sure\" not knowing anything about it at all. I reached out to them the week after and met them at their home... it turned out to be THE penthouse of the four seasons residence here in ATX. They wanted tacos for 30 people.. I performed the service and they wrote me a check for $3600+ $700 in tip. This is where I knew I had something. In my mind, I immediately said \"There has got to me more people like this\". 2 months later I had built my website, created a brand image, and opened a bank account &amp; LLC. I gave my 2 weeks notice with zero clients and put on my chef coat in the middle of Texas summer and went door to door at the biggest houses I could find. I would pound pavement for 6 hours a day for 3 months to hear nothing but crickets (turns out, knowing what I know now, summer is the WORST time here for my business). As stated above on the 4th month, one client reached out and I closed that deal for weekly meal prep @ $500/wk+groceries. I was able to float.. Over the next 4-5 months I had earned roughly $35k. I kept cooking solo for the next 4.5 years, 7 days a week, all holidays, etc. \n\nIn the 5th year, I sat down at my computer because I was behind on office work and come to find out that I had missed roughly $300,000 in potential revenue by simply not having the bandwidth to take on more work by myself. I hired another chef (and this is why it is an unscalable business) but that didn't help much because most requests come for basically 3 days of the week. Thursday, Friday and Saturday. This means that even if both of us were at a dinner party cooking, I was still missing out on between 1-8 requests for service on that Saturday. This continued to happen week after week after week. I tried hiring people on a base pay weekly + they keep 100% of their tip. This blew up in my face in said summer slump because I was paying the base but the chefs were not working. It was working but I wasn't making any money because the summer would bleed me dry. Right at this time Covid hits.. I have to lay everybody off.. you all know how that went.. I came up with a meal delivery service and barely got through this stage but I figured out how to keep the business running. During this time, I told 3 of my chefs \"If you stay with me, I will split evenly whatever comes in so we can all stay afloat during this time\".  Well about 3 months into the pandemic, here in Texas, our Governor came on the TV and announced that we were \"open to gatherings of 14 people and less\". Being in the dinner party scene, my business' phones went crazy. Right away, people (past and present clients) wanted to get together with their friends and family at the house to have a party. \n\nA new era is born. Since the old way wasn't working (paying a base pay weekly + tip) I knew things had to change. During the meal delivery days, I instinctively went with that \"rev split model\" and it seemed to work out. So I kept with it. 50% to the chef and 50% to me and the chef keeps 100% of the tip they receive. This is where things finally changed and how I was able to make it to my first $1M year. The beauty is that the chef gets to work less than they work in a restaurant but earn double to quadruple what they were earning in the restaurant. I stopped cooking and started to figure out how to scale this model and operate the business. This is where I am at... 4 years later... 3 broken process buildouts... a software stack that is everywhere.. and I am beginning to break. Yes, what I have works but it is clunky and make shifted. I have, I can't even count (in the thousands) how many leads that \"went with another option\" because we are high in pricing compared to competitors (that are only a one man show). I know how to fix this, I know what needs to be built, but the way things are right now, it cannot be done. I have tried many different things but at the end of the day people (developers &amp; automation specialists) tell me the same thing. \"what you are trying to build is going to cost you \\~$3-$500,000 and we can't promise you that it will solve your main concerns\". \n\n  \nYes, what I am trying to build out is complex. Yes, I understand that it is going to take $$ to do it. No, I do not have half a million dollars to roll the dice on something that is not going to move my needle FOR SURE. ",

Reaching out on Reddit is a great start for anonymous support. \n\nJoin communities - I've seen lots of people talk about communities on Slack and discord (there might be some good ones on Facebook, but the ones I've come across so far are just for promotion).\n\nAlso network with business owners in your area IRL.\n\nBut the online communities are helpful for when you're off business hours or you need to get something off your chest and come back to it the next day with support.\n\nYou can check out the Two One Four Business Owners slack community for free. There's a sign-up process because we only want to let in real business owners. \n\nHope that helps. You're NOT alone and there are thousands of people who are in the same boat or who have overcome the same frustrations!",

          "body": "Building solo comes with a kind of loneliness no one warns you about. What helps a lot is finding even a small circle of people who get it. Other founders understand the confused looks from friends and the long days where nothing seems to move. Having folks to talk to makes it feel less like you’re stuck in your own head. It also helps to track small wins so you can see progress when the day to day feels blurry. And treating decisions like you’re advising someone else can calm some of that internal arguing. If it starts to feel too heavy, a mentor can give you perspective and take some of the pressure off. You’re not alone in feeling this way, even if it feels like it in the moment. Keep going.",

I also used a person in the ad thinking people are attracted to a face as nobody in the entire page has that. It's just walls and walls of texts and logos. \n\nIt's been going gangbusters since day 1 the newspaper hit homes. The ad is betting me 1 to 2 new clients every day. Half of them tell me about how they got ripped off by the competitors and yesterday one client asked if what I was charging was enough and whether I wanted more, which was real nice of her. \n\nSeveral weeks ago I was starting to panic, both my wife and I were applying for jobs we absolutely didn't want to do. I'm just over the moon that something so simple actually worked!\n\nThe beauty of these clients is they keep coming back for more and tell their friends. What a bloody relief in this market!\n\nLittle bit of a side gig story but wanted to share as well.  I also found out my local bottle $0.10 refund recycling centre loans out wheelie bins and picks them up on the regular so I managed to convince two restaurant owners who weren't recycling to let me handle all their bottles and cans. Both said yes. I'm thinking I may be able to make $10,000 a year just for hooking them up with the recyclers as a middleman.",

I now know that I need long-term goals.\n\nFocus is the other lesson. Steve Jobs was known for saying \"No\" to many things. I've learned that the hard way. I've constantly been distracted by \"oh shiny new project\". DO NOT.\n\nThe hardest part is knowing if you really have a product. I see a lot of people build things that, from my experience, no one is going to touch. If you can get past that and know you are onto something, then the next step is to keep polishing it. Wax on... Wax off... \n\nJust keep taking one step at a time, and in time (most likely more than a year), you will have something people will want.\n\nAlso, listen to feedback and try to do those things rapidly!

They’re not the only ones though, you have those like TSMC, ASML, Micron, Broadcom, Qualcomm, etc. There’s also Intel, AMD, and Nvidia too of course, who get more of the attention but also do a lot more other than just CPUs and GPUs.\n\nData centres I’m not so sure about. It seems to be more internal. I know Amazon has a lot, but you won’t just be investing in their data warehouses. OpenAI also has a lot, but again you won’t just be investing in their data warehouses, and then on top of that you also can’t directly invest in them either. Plenty of other similar examples, but I can’t think of anyone who is solely a data centre.

Find subreddits where your ideal clients spend time, such as r/Entrepreneur, r/SmallBusiness, r/SaaS, and r/Startups. Avoid the marketing subreddits; they are filled with marketers, not buyers.\n\n\n\n2. Don’t sell. Help. Answer questions and share short, useful tips. Comment before you post. People will reach out when they find value.\n\n\n\n3. Share proof, not pitches. Use case studies, before-and-after examples, and lessons learned, instead of saying, “buy my service.”\n\n\n\n4. Create a clean profile.When someone visits your profile, they should easily see who you help, the results you achieve, and how to contact you. \n\n\n\n5. Be patient. Reddit rewards consistency over ads.\n\n\n\nWhen you provide value first, clients will come to you.",

No loans. No investors. No safety net. Just work ethic and showing up every day. In about thirty months we grew to more than 3 million dollars per year in revenue. \n\nWhen we reached that level I wanted to hire more people and stabilize cash flow so the company could continue growing in a healthy way. I went for an SBA loan to support hiring and operations.\n\nA national brokerage I worked with told me that in order to qualify for the SBA loan I needed to take certain short term financing products first. They presented this as a routine step that helps underwriting and repeatedly reassured me that the SBA approval was essentially done. They also told me not to apply anywhere else so it would not interfere with the process.\n\nI trusted them. And yes I know how stupid that looks now. I am not pretending I made a smart choice. I made a mistake. I believed someone who sounded confident and authoritative and it put me in a bad position.\n\nThe SBA loan never came. The promises were not real. And I ended up with aggressive short term debt that I never needed and never would have taken if I had not been told it was required.\n\nThe worst part is that having these short-term loans now blocks me from real lending. It does not matter that the business brings in over 3 million dollars per year or that the pipeline is strong. Every legitimate lender sees these obligations and says no. I cannot get the SBA loan anymore. I cannot get a term loan. I cannot refinance. It is an automatic rejection every time.\n\nThe business itself is not failing. The demand is there. The revenue is there. The work is there. What is failing is the financing situation that was pushed onto me under false guidance. And I am not losing the company but I am losing my mind trying to fix this while keeping everything running.\n\nI am working with attorneys because of how this was handled but that takes time and I need a practical path forward now.\n\nI am looking for guidance from anyone who has dealt with something similar.\n\nHas anyone been misled during the SBA process?\n\nHas anyone successfully negotiated or restructured short term financing?\n\nHas anyone brought in a private capital partner or done a revenue share to rebalance cash flow?\n\nWhere do entrepreneurs in this situation actually find lenders who understand real revenue instead of just looking at these short term loans as a red flag?\n\nI am keeping my identity private for obvious reasons but I am open to talking privately with anyone who has real experience with this or who invests in strong operators navigating temporary financial pressure.\n\nI built this company from nothing and it is not going under but my growth is now greatly hindered by these and I am asking for some direction in order to get out.",

Again depending on many factors. Ive seen one that was even able to point you in the right direction of getting a better termed loan  to pay the settlement, and the fact they are bankruptcy attorneys in it self carries heavy negotiating power with the other companys as then they know they are looking at fighting over scraps to potentially nothing and having to work for it pay attorneys themselves etc.  So if you can get the debt negotiated down to a settlement less than what it will cost them to have their attorneys fight in a bankruptcy estate against all your other creditors then you  win.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been meaning to post this for a while. I started lurking on forums and subreddits about reselling around 2017. Back then, I was the guy asking everyone what the best niches were and how to find them.\n\nI’ll never forget one response I got. The person said, “First, why would I tell you my niche? Then I’d have a competitor. Second, your niche should find you organically, and it should be something you actually enjoy.”\n\nI felt a little disinterested after hearing that. I went on with the normal job grind, learning IT, getting certifications, and eventually an AS degree. The jobs were okay, but I always felt like I was wasting my time. Shout out to anyone who loves IT, I met plenty of people who were happy with it.\n\nIn 2019, I tried reselling thrifted clothes and computer parts. I lost my ass on eBay fees, shipping, and supplies. I didn’t know what I was doing and eventually gave up. I never quit my day job, thinking reselling just wasn’t for me.\n\nThen in 2022, I got into a specific collectable niche. It’s a hobby that so many people love, and there are endless avenues you can take. I bought my first piece and fell in love with it. I dove into the lore and became obsessed in a healthy way. About a year later it clicked.\n\nI relaunched my platforms, built a website, and started tracking profit and loss. Slowly the numbers started climbing. Now I sell this niche full time and I genuinely enjoy what I do. I love when people ask me what I do and when friends and family come to me with questions.\n\nIt’s a tangible item that people enjoy, and some pieces can even be passed down or traded depending on rarity.\n\nLooking back, that Reddit user from years ago was right. Your niche should find you. You don’t have to chase the perfect thing. I found something I liked, never planned to sell it, and because I naturally gravitated toward it, it made sense.\n\nYou can do it too.\n\n(I am open to answer questions broadly and provide some motivation and direction) ",

You can also get it and it could make you feel nothing. you could do a simple thing and it could feel like the whole world.* But alas a trade has to be made. be it time, effort or frustration.

If you want help developing your business ideas, I recommend signing up for a business mentor and online workshops with SCORE.org. It's a FREE service run by successful entrepreneurs who donate their time. You can have as many mentors and sessions as you want, always free. You can do a search for mentors across the country by selecting ANY LOCATION and then read through their profiles. If you like one, request them by name and city and they'll match you, doesn't matter where you live. Same for workshops. Do a search using ANY LOCATION. Some workshops cost $10 but most are free.

My question to you is: How did you start your business? How did you come up with the idea for the business? I know that If you are looking for ideas on reddit, you probably shouldn’t start a business. What was your lightbulb moment, where you said “yeah i can do that”? Should I wait until that moment comes to me? Can everything be turned into a business? Do I really have to be passionate about the topic? What should I do to increase my chances of coming up with an idea? Thank you everyone!",

Passion grows once you see progress and once you see people getting value from what you do.\n\nMy biggest advice is to start small. Solve one simple problem for one specific group. Test it quickly. See how people react. You don’t have to quit your job to do this. I built the first version of my business while still working full-time.\n\nFeeling lost is normal.

We all die someday; better prepare while we’re alive.\n\n**How did you come up with the idea for the business?**\n\nI just kept doing the same work I was doing as an employee, but as an independent contractor. And once I was on my own, I began to see problems that nobody had solved yet. So I built solutions.\n\n**What was your lightbulb moment, where you said “yeah i can do that”?**\n\nNever had one. Business is more like a war. The moment you feel “oh yes, I’m very capable now” is the moment you step on a mine. You survive by staying cautious and assuming the world is perfectly capable of crushing your tiny business. 🙂\n\n**Should I wait until that moment comes to me?**\n\nIt won’t come to you.

When things get tough (and they will), passion is what keeps you moving.\n\n**What should I do to increase my chances of coming up with an idea?**\n\nAwareness, attention, and a bit of empathy.

You’re running into problems because you’re not sure what you want, you’re looking for rapid success without guidance, and you have financial pressures. This is totally normal. \n\nI would recommend you do a variety of activities. 1. You should set a small goal. “Find a way to earn $200 outside of work this month”. Reach the goal and scale it. You’re doing this to build confidence that you can do it, but not setting goals too high. It also takes time to build a business and grow a brand. Since you need cash now, focus on things that get you that. Business is very demanding and it sucks if you don’t have funds (you’ll need to put some funds into your business or be in a position to borrow). \n\n2. Build the right network: You need a community of support, because running a business can get lonely. It’s also easier to learn from other’s mistakes and gain power resources.\n\n3. Map out your strategy and goals after picking what you want to do. You don’t have to be super passionate, but the drive has to be there. Waking up everyday and pushing yourself to work a business you hate, probably won’t work out well. Look at the top reasons why people are successful at that particular business and the top reasons why people fail. Spend less time overthinking and more time on action.\n\n4. Use what you learn to build the right system and habits designed for how you work. \n\n5. Always focus on solving problems and delivering quality.\n\nThere’s a lot more to this, but those are the basics in my opinion. If you start reflecting and focusing on your own solutions, then you’ll begin to find the right path. Block out all the noise and move forward.",

          "body": "I'm not really a professional marketer but I am Indian American so I understand the nuances between Indian and American culture. \n\nEverything about the App/Website/ you're offering SCREAMS Indian. Again it's not necessarily a bad thing because this works in the Indian market. But in the American market this is going to put people off. \n\nUnfortunately, if you're going to try to market it in the US, you're going to need to commodify Yoga a little bit. \n\nFirst off Yog4Lyf, the name sounds like a kid came up with it. You need to change the name to something that relates to Yoga but is easy to pronounce and not taken. For example: Asana (easy sanskrit word for non indians to pronounce). It needs to FEEL authentic for the average American user. \n\nIt also seems like you're focusing on the medical issues. I think a couple of your strengths are the plus size Yoga courses, weight loss, and women's reproductive health ones. For most americans yoga is a wellness activity where they want to stretch and reduce stress. \n\nI think for the thyroid ones and fertility ones since those are more physiological and more serious topics, those should be evidence based. If there's evidence to back it up that these exercises actually produce outcomes then those should be marketed otherwise it will lower your credibility. \n\nYour current marketing is very pseudoscientific especially if you're trying to approach it with a do x asana so you can make y go away. For example: An ad on you instagram says \"for facial hair on PCOS try X asana because it balances your testosterone\". You have to go deeper than balancing hormones. \n\nFor the American market, Yoga is a wonderful starting point for getting into exercising. You can use increased mobility, easing period pain, etc. as your selling point. \n\nAnother thing your marketing should focus on is AUTHENTICITY. Western Yoga practice is very removed from it's indian orgins. You need to make it more palatable to the average non-indian american who is interested in Yoga. Incorporating Ayurvedic principles in your app will differentiate you and make you look more authentic and incorporating sanskrit terminology that's true to Yoga. \n\nThe appearance of the instructors and people who are marketing the app also matters. You're going to need  conventionally attractive Indian/Indian americans people to be the models who fit the western beauty standard but are also approachable. Like fitness type folks who have fit bodies but not too fit. I think on your team Neha Singh fits the western standard. You just need to put them in American fitness wear for women that's sleeveless tanks or a a shirt that's not too baggy and tights. For men that's shorts and a well fitted shirt. An indian accent that's palatable to western audiences without being something that will turn off people because they sound \"too indian\" would be something like a bangalore/dehli girl accent that has an indian but also a western touch. Appearance does matter for a lot of people unfortunately. \n\nPlus define your market, are you trying to appeal to So Cal smoothie health freaks or people who don't know where to even begin exercising? If you're trying to build a wellness brand, then partner with people who will bring the wellness aspect like medspas or like gyms or vacation places. Maybe have a couple of people organize like live Yoga classes in person. I'm from socal and there's a bunch of people doing yoga on a beach or sum. You really have to try hard to appeal to them. The issue with this is there's a bunch of other American companies competing in this space. \n\n Another market is people who don't have access to proper healthcare and nutrition but it would be more difficult to tap in. As a pre-health student, there's a lot of inequality in the US and something that makes exercise more approachable for low income folks who don't have much time but also are intimidated to go to the gym is a very untapped market that an app like this could help out. \n\nYou can DM if you're interested. I'd be interested in helping out as I'm passionate about bring awareness about indian practices that are based in vedic orgins and helping westerners understand rich cultural heritage around it.",

Your numbers in India are impressive - 1M+ downloads and $25K MRR while bootstrapped is no joke.\n\nThe culture is usually different than India and the TGs are also little different.

In India, Yoga/ wellness is a culture whereas in US people considered as a either mental or physical health related activity.   \n  \n3. In pricing point of view - $25K MRR is working in India but for US  have different willingness to pay or value proposition might be different.   \n\n\n**Before you bring someone on Revenue share:**   \n1. Have you ever tried using ads or paid campaigns in US (I mean TG specific audience)?  \n2. Is your content specific in India or language specific or is it focused on US language or US target audience understanding? Are you localizing content or just translating?  \n3. What's the US usebase number of people you have it may be small but what is the numbers behind it?   \n\n\n **On a partnership end:** \n\n* Rev share can work but most experienced US GTM folks will want to see that the product/messaging has PMF signals in US first. Otherwise they're taking on product market fit risk, not just execution risk.\n* Considering a hybrid small retainer + rev share might attract stronger candidates.\n\nHappy to chat more if helpful.

So even after paying $20k+ and doing work, they could potentially argue you didn't try hard enough.\nI talked to a lawyer who said these agreements are designed to be vague so they can keep coming back, the confidentiality clause means most business owners can't even compare notes or warn each other.\nAnyone else seen agreements like this?

What I suspect is that more people are actually fighting these claims and making the argument that the claimant is not actually being discriminated against, and this is just a cash grab due to poor ADA implementation.\n\nThus, these ongoing terms would be an attempt to legitimise the claim by making it appear that the suit really WAS about making the website compliant. I would strongly suspect that they would never even look at the website again, once a settlement was made.\n\nYour friend has a problem, because there's nothing they can do to fix their website - it's entirely down to Shopify and the theme designer to sort it, but you can bet there's terms and conditions that absolve them of any responsibility. I believe even the bits Shopify DO commit to are only WCAG 2.1 compliant, not 2.2 (which became a standard in Oct 2025, so very recently).\n\nI would check if ADA actually requires WCAG2.2 for starters, it would be unusual for them to have updated the rules so quickly after a standard became official. If not, then seek legal advice on what the implications of that are - they can't mandate you are more accessible than the law requires.\n\nI'd also petition every level of government you can, hard and frequently, about this. And get all of your small business, website-owning friends to do the same. At some point, this shit will come for them all, and the financial impact can be huge because it's almost always a open/shut technical win for the claimants.\n\nEdit: I forgot to share this, which is essentially Shopify's view on the matter: [https://www.shopify.com/news/accessibility-lawsuits](https://www.shopify.com/news/accessibility-lawsuits) \\- no answers, but an interesting read all the same.",

Secondly, the same lawyers that are shaking people down will come back for a second round. I know this for a fact because of one of those friends that was sued got sued again by the same company because he didn’t have stuff like all his alt text and other crap labeled properly. For example if you were just to do a standard rollover on an image, nothing would pop up to describe what’s in that image. That’s dumb on his part because that’s basic stuff and it helps with SEO.

I notice that one employee submitted the exact same Uber receipt twice (same ride and same amount 38 bucks) once in February and again in April. at first I figured it was just a mistake like maybe they just accidentally uploaded the same photo twice or something\n\nI then started actually looking at their other submissions and that's when I was able to figure it out. Personal grocery runs labeled as 'office supplies' dinner with their friends labeled as 'client meeting' and I'm pretty sure some of the receipt screenshots were edited because the fonts looked off and dates didn't line up with the transaction amounts\n\nI went back through about 6 months of their reports and conservatively they probably stole around $2500 (2544 bucks to be exact) from us. When I confronted them they got immediately defensive and tried to say it was \"unclear what counted as a business expense\" and then quit on the spot. Yes they quit on the spot  \n  \nYesterday I got paranoid cuz I started thinking of all the people that could have been doing this too and I just never noticed because I've never dealt with expenses  \nI don't want to become some paranoid micromanager who audits every coffee purchase but I also clearly can't just operate on the honor system anymore. I feel like I need some kind of actual system but I also don't know what's reasonable for a company our size (19 people and maybe 25 on January)",

I don't think it's as malicious as others are saying, hanlon's razor and all that. We have no idea what the workload the original bookkeeper is under.

It really isn't typically a bookkeeper's job to approve expenses or scrutinize receipts. That is purely management's/the owner's responsibility. Instead of firing the bookkeeper I think you should have controls in place where all receipts submitted to her to be entered/paid out need to be signed and approved by management/owner. This sounds like the bookkeeper is an employee and not a hired firm as op was taking over duties and I very highly doubt this bookkeeper is a CPA as some are saying here because I don't know a single CPA who would ever take a job working for a bookkeeper's salary at a small company. In this case, the employee would have been given instructions and told what to do for their job and if there were no controls put in place then it is clearly not their fault and all of you business owners out here wanting a witch hunt for the bookkeeper should probably make sure that proper controls are in place for your own businesses because there is no recourse against the bookkeeper.

          "body": "I have investigated fraud and embezzlement through expense reports and vendor invoices, and more often than not the investigation proved the allegations false. Prevention through clear expectations, audits, and internal controls should be your focus. \n\nGiven the employee's response of running, I would say there is a good chance they were guilty. However, make sure you keep evidence and write up a synopsis should they try to get unemployment for a hostile workplace given their assertion of vague policy and being confronted.  \n\nWhen people commit fraud, they usually put in a lot of effort to make sure nothing will raise a red flag. Dinners coincided with business trips or visiting clients or conferences or recruiting events.  The fraud would be submitting the same receipt that someone else paid and submitted to another company. Do you require attendees to be listed (you should because iirc employee meals even while traveling are written off at 50% and potential clients at 100%) allowing you to confirm with attendees during an audit. \n\nWhere is the proof that they were personal groceries and not items for the break room, meeting snacks, or cleaning supplies? \n\nSame questions for the meals out. How do you know that it wasn't a potential client, employee meal, etc?\n\nUber fares being the same on two different days is rare, unless the fares and tips were of different value. \n\nGo through what each error was, and update your policy to include internal controls to combat such fraud or abuse from happening. \n\nRequire paper receipts to be given to payroll or whoever may need to submit them to the IRS for auditing. Spot checks to verify information matches paper and pdf. This activity of auditing should be declared in the policy (prevention is preferred) and performed whenever something doesn't feel right and randomly. If someone has the bandwidth, like a receptionist, a 100% review can be done; at least for 6 months or until you are comfortable. \n\nTo avoid two different employees submitting the same receipt, if you're using Excel, merge expense reports and analyze for duplicate charges before approving. For this to work, all expenses must be submitted in the month they occurred. And all reports are due by the Wednesday before payroll processing to give you time to audit. \n\nFor grocery trips, make sure that itemized receipts are required for reimbursement. \n\nIf employees have corporate cards, make them mandatory unless permission is granted before the expense, list acceptable reasons to use personal card. The employees are getting your miles or cashback if using their personal cards. Banks/ issuers will let you export all data for the month and some like AmEx, will have categories prepopulated and will allow you to add your policy (rules) and will flag charges that are not “in policy” to help audit.  Policy here is not from the written policy that requires adding attendees or client info to the receipt, instead this policy lets you create rules - such as dollar limits by category - that you add to help ensure you don't miss a charge that you would like to review more closely.\n\nMake the written policy clear with the intent to avoid inappropriate expenses and hold employees accountable when they violate this policy. For every issue you identify in your detailed review of others’ reports, develop an internal control that would prevent it from recurring. Include auditing and approval procedures. For example, learn how to identify changes in PDF files after scanning/photo upload; I wonder if AI could identify the slight differences in font pitch and type?\n\nIf you are struggling to determine the proper controls for your business, Google expense policies for the Fortune 5 companies (I even wrote one of them) and use parts, as appropriate, for your industry. \n\nWhen you are done updating your policy, run it through ChatGPT, with a command to address any outstanding concerns you have. Or post it here, or in other appropriate subs, and ask for help. Need a starting point? Ask AI for common ways for small businesses to combat expense fraud. In my experience, this is where I see AI to be quite accurate and helpful.",

      "selftext": "I purchased a human claw machine (large inflatable claw machine whereby an individual uses the claw and manipulates it to get prizes). It is one year on and now here is the business reality.\n\nFirst investment: equipment purchase: $3,500 on Alibaba (found manufacturer) compared to $6,000 or more on the US market (event suppliers), LLC/insurance formation: $500, and marketing resources: $300. Total: $4,300.\n\nFirst year income: 32 rentals at 300-500 dollars (according to the duration of the event and travel distance). Total revenue: $12,400.\n\nExpenses: \nInsurance cost: 800 a year, equipment maintenance cost: 200, fuel/travel cost: 600, storage cost: 0 (garage used) and marketing cost: 400. Total expenses: $2,000.\n\nNet profit year one: $10,400 less start up of 4300 = actual profit of 6100.\n\nMarket reality: It is a seasonal market (spring/summer heavy), the corporate events are better paying than birthday parties, repeat clients are hard to come by, marketing is an ongoing undertaking.\n\nLessons learned: Niche event equipment has reduced competition but reduced market. You are not making money but it is a good side business. Quality of equipment is an issue - malfunctions cost bookings.\n\nScaling potential: Has an opportunity to add additional unique equipment to provide package deals. A single-item rental business is not one that can grow without an expansion.\n\nIs it worth it? As a side business, yes. Although it is the prime income, most likely, not until you scale.",

      "selftext": "I was recently in NYC and stopped into one of the many small coffee shops in Manhattan, pretty close to Chinatown. A tiny storefront, just two tables inside plus some display shelves, a small case for baked goods, an ordering/serving counter. It might have been 150 square feet or so inside the customer area plus some room out back for making drinks. Coffee was $4 or so, a latte was $5, a croissant was $4 or $5, banana bread was $3. Hours are 8 AM to 7 PM, seven days a week.\n\nAnyway, it got me wondering how businesses like this stay open. With all of the competition plus the low per-customer revenue, how does a little place like this stay afloat in a big city? I assume the rent must be thousands per month. Do they need to own the space? Am I just not thinking through the math and not realizing that multiple small purchases a day add up? Are they running on a loan they'll never re-pay?\n\nI think about this a lot with random stores in cities. Like a little boutique-type store that sells funky little gifts, candles, greeting cards, etc. How does a place like that stay open in a presumably-desirable storefront area in a big city? Are there really enough people stopping in to support it?\n\nI guess the answer is obviously \"yes\" since they are open, but it doesn't make sense to me...",

Even a tiny coffee shop can survive if they have steady foot traffic and sell enough drinks and snacks per day. Many small spots supplement in-store sales with catering, wholesale to offices, or local delivery. Rent is huge, but some find deals in less obvious areas, share spaces, or have flexible leases. They’re rarely cash cows, but if the owner keeps costs tight and builds a loyal local following, it’s enough to stay afloat. Location, repeat customers, and community connections matter just as much as the per-item price.",

Gifting is totally separate from holiday bonuses, just to be clear.  It's not like there's a tremendous amount of thought that goes into giving somebody a cash bonus based on the value they provide, in addition to their salary - certainly less than recognizing the type of food somebody eats and customizing a gift in that manner.\n\nIf the owner gives a lot of time to help your development and growth within the company, takes you under his wing and provides mentorship, an individual gift from you to him would be a nice gesture (as it would be for any person who did something like that).  \n\nYou may find that the owner is extremely generous with holiday bonuses and gifts, then it may be the type of thing that is nice to do and everybody feels like $100 is small potatoes to contribute as a thank you back for the extreme generosity you may be about to receive.  Those who have been there longer may have already experienced that -- and having a conversation with somebody who you are friendly with in the same position can help give you more insights.   I agree with others -- definitely ask a colleague and try to get a sense of where this gift concept comes from.  Maybe you're about to get a massive bonus check! lol\n\nI will say, the nepotism (earned or not) makes this a bit more uncomfortable.

          "body": "At your size, most teams focus less on a specific system and more on tightening the processes around what they already use. An ERP usually becomes worthwhile when the business has enough operational complexity that maintaining data in multiple places starts creating delays or errors. It is less about hitting a certain revenue or headcount and more about how much time you spend reconciling information, fixing inconsistencies, or managing workarounds.\n\nThe tipping point often comes when day-to-day tasks depend on data being accurate across finance, operations, and customer activity, and manual updates can no longer keep up. There are options between spreadsheets and a full enterprise platform, but the key is understanding which parts of your current workflow feel the most fragile.\n\nIf things mostly work today with some cleanup, you are probably early. Monitoring where your processes strain will give you a clearer sense of when it is time to move to something more integrated.",

The costs have gotten relatively expensive, and I don't know if employees want this or expect it anymore. That could be a change since Covid, not sure.\n\nI think many employees focus on \"cash compensation,\" so I have offered more fringe benefits, including an educational assistance plan (capped at $5250 per year, per employee), profit-sharing for retirement fund matching, fair wages, bonuses, service awards, de minimis fringe benefits, etc.\n\n**EDIT:** Thanks for sharing all of the perspectives and experiences.

They have phased those out as well. Last year there was a veggie tray instead of dinner, and a small smattering of prizes in a drawing that only the sales team qualified for. This year they asked everyone if they wanted to go to the same place as always, a different attraction to mix it up, or get money instead of a party. Overwhelmingly people voted for money. Second choice was the new location. Not a single person voted to keep it the same as the last several years. Next day HR came out and let everyone know that they decided to do the same thing again.

We are spread across the country in small groups, so getting everyone together is not really feasible. Frankly, I don't buy the \"cash compensation\" as these events are about the team, not the individual. I give raises and bonuses to individuals. For folks who say, \"just give me the cash\" rather than have an event, they can stay home if others want to do something. I send a b-day card to every employee with a $20 gift card for Darden restaurants. Seems silly, but it is the number one thing we get positive feedback on from employees. I think it is primarily because I write each one a card, but as I mentioned we are nation/world-wide with small groups of employees, so I encourage them to use their gift cards for a group lunch and some do. Good on you for the one-weeks bonus. We could not afford to do that, but we do most of the rest that you are doing. Hats off to you.",

However, I will admit that doing it the same way that we have been has become a bit monotonous for me personally. It also has become more challenging in recent years as we've grown quite a bit so the costs are obviously increased and we're trying to physically squeeze more and more people into a moderately sized restaurant. Inevitably it will eventually run its course and we'll have to pivot, but in the mean time I still get a lot of smiling faces and \"can't wait to do this again next year\".",

The 'official' advice makes it sound 10x harder than it actually is.\n\nHere is the practical stack that worked for me to look 'native' to US partners:\n\n1. **Entity:** You don't need a lawyer. Services like **Firstbase** or **Stripe Atlas** handle the LLC formation (usually Delaware or Wyoming) and the EIN for you remotely.\n2. **Banking:** Once you have the EIN, look at **Mercury** or **Brex**. They are built for startups and friendly to non-resident owners. They give you a real US routing number.\n3. **Looking Legit (The most important part):** Brokers don't check your tax returns first; they check your digital footprint.\n   * Get a real US phone number (OpenPhone or Google Voice) so you have a +1 country code.\n   * Update your LinkedIn location to your US LLC base (or at least make it clear you operate there).\n   * Have a clean, one-page site that highlights *process* over location.\n\nDon't overthink the 'Proof of Funds' yet. Just get the structure set up so you can sign contracts legally. Good luck!",

      "selftext": "Here's some info about the business: I own a small business with 2 employees. I give 5% guaranteed annual raises that kick in on January 1. I also provide a 401k match of up to 4%. In the past Christmas bonuses have been 1% of wages earned for the year.\n\nThe bad news is that gross sales are down about 11% this year. They were also down around 9% last year. I've absorbed the costs and have kept the increases and benefits. Not sure how much longer I can hold out. It's only for 2 employees though so I think I can continue with the above for another year.\n\nHow are other small business owners navigating bonuses/raises/benefits as your sales continue to decline?\n\n  \nEdit: \n\nJust to clarify, the employees have done everything asked of them. They show up, shut up, and keep up. They work hard and are reliable. They are professional and polite. Even though the business is going through a downturn I am having trouble with the idea of withholding something from them that they are not responsible for. I understand bonuses are performance based, but their performance hasn't diminished. It's just people out there are struggling. And for those that are telling me to focus on sales, I've definitely tried a few things this year. I switched to a new POS system that better tracks customer behavior and sends reminders for increased engagement. I've offered more sales. The employees have changed displays/endcaps every month as well as getting rid of slow moving SKUs and replacing them with new products. I have gone through every expense and tried to find a way to lower overhead costs. Sometimes the economy just sucks and the free market puts you in your place. So this is less about a \"bonus\" and more about being a \"gift.\"",

If we don’t, we will be just another small business that was good when it was good but didn’t survive the downturn.  If you DM me, I’ll explain what we offer and you should explain your business and I’ll buy from you if the service is something we need, but if it’s not I’ll be glad to provide a google review or any social media review that supports your local business and if we can help you, you buy from us so at least we all build a community to help one another.  I saw this approach on r/pointofsaletech subreddit and I appreciate them trying to help all of our small businesses in this time of need.  If we all band together, we can make it, and look back at these posts in 1 year and see the difference.  Appreciate all the posts and those who are struggling to make it work. Together we will feed our families and employees.  God Bless. Stick together as a community and we can build together!!!",

It is not “automatically good” for everyone.\n\nDefault one-person LLC (no S-corp):\n\n* For tax purposes you are a sole proprietor.\n* All net profit (say 150k) is subject to self-employment tax plus income tax.\n* You cannot be your own W-2 employee, so “payroll” to yourself does not change the tax result. You just take owner draws and pay quarterly estimates.\n\nLLC taxed as an S-corp:\n\n* Same legal LLC, different tax treatment.\n* You must pay yourself a “reasonable salary” as a W-2 employee. That salary is subject to payroll taxes.\n* Profit above that salary is passed through as S-corp distributions that are not subject to self-employment tax, only income tax. On 100–200k of profit, that can easily be thousands in annual tax savings if the salary is set sensibly.\n\nMain downsides:\n\n* Extra costs: payroll provider, quarterly payroll filings, separate 1120-S return, probably higher CPA fees.\n* In Massachusetts, S-corps are subject to a state corporate excise, so you need to factor that into the math.\n* IRS can challenge you if your salary is unreasonably low.\n\nAt your income level it is usually worth having a CPA model “LLC vs S-corp” for your exact MA situation.

There have also been a few instances where he came in clearly drunk, and even more often with a strong hangover.  \nIn 99% of cases, the obvious move would be: have a talk, and if nothing changes — let him go. But here’s the problem: this guy carries the workload of two or even three people. He often stays late to finish urgent tasks and actively helps junior team members.  \nOn one hand — even with his issues, he’s more valuable than most others on the team, and my client is genuinely afraid of losing him.  \nOn the other hand — repeated conversations haven’t helped. His behavior isn’t improving, and other employees are starting to notice. In fact, there are already signs that some teammates are becoming more careless about punctuality and discipline, copying his example.  \nSo firing him feels like a bad option… but leaving things as they are is also risky.  \n  \nHas anyone seen a similar situation? How did you (or your client) navigate it? Would really appreciate any real-life insights.",

If he doesn’t want to seek some form of sobriety and make up for his past behavior, only so many chances can be given. On the other hand, his behavior is affecting the whole team and those people’s lives and feelings matter too, from a kind human standpoint and a business standpoint. \n\nI am now sober but have been in this employee’s shoes and have also with lots of active alcoholics, before and after sobriety. Let me tell you, it takes a toll on coworkers, even in subtle ways. The toll on the team has clearly already started. It sounds callous to say “Shape up or ship out,” but if nothing changes, nothing changes. \n\nAs someone else suggested, read the chapter “To Employers” in the book Alcoholics Anonymous. You might also read the first few chapters that explain AA’s view on alcoholism as a disease, if you’re curious, but it’s not strictly necessary. The book was written by a businessman and the advice in the “To Employers” chapter was probably the most accurate and qualified advice of the whole book. The language reflects the time period it was written but if you try to think like a 1930s stock broker it’s easy enough to understand the meaning. \n\nLastly, for your consideration, I got fired from a job 6 years ago and I have been sober for six years.

It’s not huge, 18 holes, kind of old-school, with those fiberglass animals and faded turf, but it’s fully functional and comes with all the equipment. The asking price isn’t even that outrageous. Less than I expected, honestly. It’s been around since the early 2000s, and the current owner is retiring. They’ve got a snack shack, a small arcade room, and a birthday party area with plastic tables and a bouncy castle setup. It’s like a time capsule from 2007.\r\nNow I can’t stop thinking about it. I don’t even play mini golf like that, but the idea of owning a weird little roadside attraction is kind of appealing. I even went down a rabbit hole looking at mini golf props on Alibaba, they’ve got everything from pirate ships to glow-in-the-dark tunnels. I know it’s probably a terrible idea. Maintenance, insurance, seasonal traffic, all that. But part of me wants to fix it up, throw in a food truck, maybe host events. Worst case, I end up with the most chaotic backyard in the state.\r",

Tell her in researching you found it is available on Amazon far less that you can offer and just encourage her to purchase it there.\n\n2. Tell her nothing and figure it is not your job to do their research and sell it at the originally quoted price of $650. \n\n3. Buy it yourself off of Amazon and do a minimal mark-up to make the sale. \n\nMy only concern is if she purchases it from us in any manner and then realizes it could have been purchased for far less and either wants to return it, or wants an explanation. \n\nThoughts?

And still, every candidate either gives super vague answers, talks only in buzzwords, or says they “do everything” but can’t actually explain a single real campaign they’ve run.\n\nSome of them look amazing on paper… then the interview starts and I’m like ???  \nAnd don’t even get me started on the no-shows, the “can we reschedule?” messages, and the time-zone chaos.\n\nSo now I’m wondering is it actually this hard for everyone?  \nOr is my process missing something obvious?\n\n*  How are you all finding solid marketing people remotely?  \n* Any platforms, tips, or methods that actually worked for your small business? \n* Or is hiring for marketing just a universal nightmare right now?\n\nbcoz at this point it genuinely feels like I’m doing two jobs: business owner and of a full-time recruiter ",

I successfully manage marketing for multiple businesses and that's only one of the many things I do for them. It's not essentially a job that requires a full-time employee and the businesses that do need full-time staff for marketing are pretty big. I would however avoid working with agencies or anyone that cannot give you clear numbers on costs, ROI and etc. if you go the route of having an outsider take care of the marketing. Make sure you define where they need to live (ex in the US), timezones and etc to weed out the overseas folks.",

If they say bathroom issues kill them with kindness. \n\n“I’m so sorry you’re dealing with a health condition that requires this. As an employer I am legally required to make sure I am properly accommodating medical conditions.

          "body": "First, people with disabilities have an obligation to request accommodations if they're needed. \n\nProviding accommodations that have not been requested can actually be interpreted as harassment or discrimination. \n\nThis person has presumably not requested accommodation, and has not provided documentation that they need to be away from their desk for long periods, correct?\n\nIf you have HR, it's time to have them speak to the person about their excessive breaks. Or terminate them if they're in a probationary period. \n\nThere's no need to ask if they need an acommodation. If there was a documented need for that, they would have requested it in writing. This is just shirking.\n\nBut certainly check with your in-house legal department. You can also call the ADA hotline for employers, and ask them what your obligations are for an employee who has NOT indicated that they have a disability, and who has NOT requested accommodation, and who has NOT provided documentation that accommodation is needed. Pretty sure they'll laugh, and reassure you.",
