          "body": "Just flip stuff.\n\nDownload apps like DealScout and FreebieAlerts that send you push notifications when listings that match your search criteria are posted, and then just go pick up whatever deals look best. They send you push notifications as soon as things are listed so that you are the first one to be able to message and go get a really good deal if something is listed way below what it’s worth.\n\nIt’s something that you can do during your days off, but also something that you can do in the morning/evenings before and after work and you can do the searching/lock down deals while at work.   \n  \nI’ve seen people in this sub that have commutes that are two hours long set up the app to look for things along their path to and from work and then they just set up pick ups/drop offs along their commute and they make a couple hundred extra bucks every week pretty much just doing the same thing they’re already doing.\n\nThat’s how most of these big guys are flipping cars, couches, phones, and other types of stuff. They aren’t paying the normal prices that you see, they’re paying way less and they’re doing that by being the first one to go get these deals from these people that underprice them either because they don’t know the value, or don’t care about the value and just want it gone.\n\nMy advice would be just find something that you know a lot about, use an app to look for you, and just pick up the best deals and make sure that you’re the first message. Pretty easy to make a couple hundred extra bucks a week and 100% something you can do while working because it doesn't take any work to find these if you're doing it right, and then all of the actual \"work\" you have to do can happen before/after normal work hours",

I realized how lucrative the wedding industry is and after spending a couple months watching TheRentalGuy on YouTube, I decided to take a shot.\n\nI had no idea how small or large I wanted to be. So, as most of us do, I faked it until I made it. After the LLC, I created a logo and put a listing on Facebook marketplace for table and chair rentals — the standard white padded chairs, round and rectangular tables. I posted about 8pm on a Friday and by 8:30pm I received my first booking… for a 300 person party! I owned nothing. I almost turned it down but instead I decided to ensure it was legitimate by meeting for a cash 50% deposit. I then spent $10k purchasing the equipment new (the rental was for $1500 a few months later, so I had time).\n\nI made 8k that August-December, then in 2025 business picked up about February again (seasonal) and I cleared just at 40k by EOY.\n\nThe 2 things I underestimated the most was the sheer size and space you need — I ran it out of a 16x22 detached garage. I had enough room to move around but had to be strategic. The other thing is the maintenance (chairs mainly). The white chairs need to be cleaned about half the time after being rented out. That takes most of my time. The preparation. I have some late Friday nights if I push it off until then to prep for the weekend, but on the weekends I’m spending maybe 3-4 hours before noon each day delivering and picking up. Some weeks a lot less work depending on the shape of the equipment and different factors.\n\nIt is the least passive of income there is. I’ve since purchased an enclosed trailer. And I’m worn out a lot.  If I can say no anytime. But on the other hand, once it’s paid off, it sure if nice to make a random $500 for maybe 2 hours worth of work on a Saturday morning. Between March and October, some weekends I make $200, others I make $3000. It’s solely up to how much time and inventory you have.\n\nYear 1 was a larger scale than I expected and I spread myself thin at times but I can scale back as much as I want. Even with 1/4 the equipment, a lot of $ can be made. It’s a great side hustle if you have the physical ability.",

Just install Rakuten or Ibotta and you get money back on stuff you're already buying. Not huge but genuinely zero time investment.\n\nStock photography if you have a decent phone camera is another one people sleep on. Takes some upfront effort to build a portfolio but once your photos are up they just sit there earning passively.\n\nSurveys are the other consistent one for low time commitment. I know it sounds boring but they fit perfectly into a packed schedule because you can do them in random 15 to 20 minute gaps.

The catch is nobody tells you about it, obviously they are not going to announce that stuff, you have to go find it yourself.  \n  \nEach claim takes maybe 15-20 min, most don't even need receipts, just need you to confirm you used whatever service during the right dates, I've gotten checks for $8 and checks for $340. average is probably around $75, but just know that it takes time  \n  \nAt first I was just googling and checking sites manually, it was okay but I couldnt remember all the services I used like 4 years ago (I cant even remember what I had for lunch yesterday lol), around june I tried using settlemate bc it flags based on actual purchases and accounts, I try to batch them, knock out 3-4 claims during lunch or while watching something.  \n  \nThe downsides are real tho, money is slow as hell, some pay in 6 weeks, some take like 8 months, you need patience, also this isn't replacing actual income, it's more like the same category as survey apps or cashback stuff, small effort, small returns, but it adds up.  \n  \nIf you're already doing beer money type things this fits right in, won't make you rich but $1200 for maybe 10 total hours of work spread across the year really helped me, I track everything in a spreadsheet so I know what's pending vs what already hit.",

      "selftext": "This one stings to write. We built a little task management PWA with my roommate back in August of 2025. One of our main selling points was that it worked offline and added tasks even without the internet. We tested the hell out of it. service workers, cache API, the whole deal. And it  worked flawlessly and we were so proud.\n\nNow, Fast forward to last week. Our app store rating 3.1 stars\n\nthe reviews were brutal \"offline mode doesn't work. tried on plane, nothing saved\"\n\n\"says it works offline but lost all my tasks when Wi-Fi came back\"\n\n\"false advertising tbh\"\n\nI was SO confused because it worked perfectly for me. opened dev tools, went offline, added tasks, went back online - everything synced. Then i checked our analytics chrome users: offline mode success rate 94% safari users offline mode success rate 38%\n\noh no!!!. We got to know that safari's service worker implementation is... how do i put this nicely like it’s Complete garbage. Specifically, Safari doesn't cache POST requests with service workers. Our app's core action was submitting a new task (POST request). So when iOS users went offline and added tasks, the service worker just... silently failed. they'd see the task in the UI (optimistic update), reconnect to Wi-Fi, and Boom!!! it's gone.\n\nI shipped a flagship feature that literally didn't work for 60% of mobile users.\n\nAnd the worst part? i only tested on chrome. my MacBook, my android phone, chrome dev tools. never once opened safari dev tools. We spent the last 4 days rebuilding with indexedDB + a sync queue that batches requests when connection returns. Now it actually works on safari. The new ratings were 4.2 stars and climbing.\n\nNow suggestions….If you're building a PWA and marketing offline functionality, TEST ON SAFARI and I would suggest testing it on drizz(dot)dev or xyz or any other tool out there. And don’t just \"open it and click around\" but actually profile the service worker behavior. safari and chrome are not the same.\n\nAnd from now ain’t no way we are using \"works offline!\" as a marketing point again….\n\n until we've tortured tested it on every browser lol….\n\n",

Another thing: to really learn and see results, no matter which side hustle you choose, you need to start taking action and testing things. If you can bring a computer and use it during your commute, you can start taking action.

People without a truck who are too lazy to haul it to the dump themselves or got rejected by the furniture donation people. which is a good enough market, could work\n\nanother (better?) option is small scale moving. like maybe someone wants to buy a sofa on facebook, but they dont have a car that can fit it, or dont want to hire a pro mover for 1 item. so you go over there, pickup the couch, deliver it to the new address\n\ni would set up an online form, with a smiling nice looking picture of you standing next to your car, so people can just book online for next thursday",

They’re too caught up on making their store or finding products plus dealing with the current tariffs which fcks the personal profit margins up nowadays. Plus you’re 14, you won’t have an easy way of getting suppliers to work with you even if you tried. And half the crap you see online about it, it’s just influencers who don’t even go into the full scope of things. \n\nBut at 14 years old, I’d suggest putting that lawn mower to work. Ask any of your neighbors if they’d be willing to pay you to do their yards. Or if you live somewhere where it’s snowing, you could offer shoveling services. You could sell the oculus and ds I guess but it depends how much you list each item for and if anyone is willing to buy it off your hands in the first place. Maybe become a dog walker ?

Parents don't wanna fly with car seats, cribs, strollers, all that bulky stuff so they just rent it when they get here. I started with a car seat and pack n play I bought secondhand for like $80 total, cleaned them up real good and listed them.\n\nFirst month I made maybe $200 but then summer hit and I was getting $600-800 monthly. Now I've got 6 car seats, 3 cribs, 2 strollers, a high chair and some other random stuff. Last month I cleared $1,240 and I probably spent 4 hours total on dropoffs and pickups.\n\nThe best part is most of the gear just sits in my garage between rentals. I'll get a booking notification, confirm it, drop the stuff off at their hotel or rental, then pick it up when they leave. Sometimes I don't even see them cause they leave it with the front desk. Takes 20 mins max per rental.\n\nInitial investment was around $900 from Stаke for everything and I hit break even after month 3. Now its pretty much pure profit minus the occasional replacement if something breaks. Been throwing most of it toward my emergency fund which needed some padding anyway.\n\nOnly annoying part is when people are weird about used gear even though everything gets sanitized between uses. Had one lady ask if the car seat was \"certified clean\" like there's some official baby gear certification lmao. But 95% of people are super chill and just happy they dont have to lug their own stuff through the airport.",

          "body": "The comments are ridiculous... people are giving you trouble for 30 minutes of cleaning and saying it's not passive income. No income is truly passive income, there is always some work that needs to go into it. I think this is good enough because you technically could hire a cleaner, but since it's such a small space and conveniently attached to the house, you don't really need to. \n\nFurthermore, all these people questioning the 30min clean-time probably aren't considering the fact that these are mostly short stays and a very small space as you mentioned (300sqft I believe). If it takes you 2+ hours to clean 300sqft space after someone lived in it for 2-3 days, then I would be quite concerned about your efficiency or the tenants themselves. \n\nI used to live in an 800 sqft apartment years ago and it would only take me 30min every few days to upkeep my place. This includes running a robot vacuum, doing a second pass with my dyson, mopping, running dishwasher, dusting and cleaning a single washroom. Once in a while (maybe every 1-2 months), I'll do a deep clean which would take an hour. I've received multiple compliments about cleanliness from guests + I'm OCD as well. \n\nSo really not sure why people are questioning you at all. ",

They booked the place for a full month last summer, in September, loved it so much, they made their booking for next summer before even they checked out!\n\nIts all about making guests feel exquisite. We’ve agreed to buy specific high-end furniture for the terrace, upgrade the shower, buy additional wardrobes for the bathrooms and refresh the kitchenware and silverware.\n\nAll things said and done, we’ll be at ~$28-29k in profits after taxes.

      "selftext": "I'm an accountant and last June I was watching TikTok at midnight when I saw some faceless account explaining credit cards with 2 million views. I thought I could do that and made my first video the next day.\n\nGot 147 views. My mom didn't even watch it.\n\nMade 11 more videos over three weeks. Highest was 380 views. Gave up for a month because it felt pointless. Then in August I posted one about savings accounts and it randomly got 50k views overnight. No idea why that one worked.\n\nThat's when I actually tried. The free text to speech sounded awful so I switched to APOB for the avatar stuff. It's not perfect, someone commented \"bro sounds like he's underwater\" which was fair, but I can make a video in 15 minutes now.\n\nI post 3 or 4 times a week after dinner. Account is at 7400 followers. Some videos get 30k views, some get 900. I made one explaining APR that I thought was solid and it died at 600 views. Then made one about Costco memberships as a joke and it got 40k. Algorithm is completely random.\n\nMoney breakdown last month: $47 from creator fund, $248 from affiliate link in my bio, had 31 people sign up for a budgeting app I actually use, and $45 from three people who Venmo'd me to answer credit questions which was weird but whatever. Total $340.\n\nThis month is tracking around $280. It's not consistent and definitely not quit your job money but it covers internet, Spotify, and usually leaves enough for drinks on the weekend. Takes maybe 2 hours a week total.\n\nWeirdest part is people think I'm some finance guru now. Someone asked me to manage their portfolio. I'm an accountant at a mid size firm, I just know how credit cards work because I explained it to my little brother five times.\n\nAlso had someone spam \"is this AI\" on every video so I started responding \"yes I'm a robot beep boop\" and they stopped.\n\nIf you're thinking about this just pick something you know and start posting. First 15 videos will probably suck. One will randomly hit and you'll figure it out. Don't expect thousands of dollars but $200-300 a month for basically no effort is doable.\n\nStill think it's kind of dumb but my roommate stopped making fun of me after I paid for pizza with TikTok money so I guess that's something.",

I personally have yet to try Prolific, but I was consistently making an extra $200 a month (\\~30min a day for 6 months) from doing surveys on cloud until I got banned for speeding through them, something I forgot they were against in their tos.\n\nYouTube - If you watch streamers, take clips from their streams, edit them, and upload them to youtube. I haven't made any money doing this yet, but I got a brand new channel to 800 subscribers and 650k views in just a month doing exactly what I just described. I've seen people making $10-20k a month doing this, but I think $100-300 is much more realistic.\n\nDaytrading - WAIT, I know how much flak it gets, but that's just because of how it's presented. People act as if it'll make you rich quick, which to be fair, it can, but a good rule of thumb is that if something could make you rich quick, it could make you poor quicker, so be careful and do a lot of research if you decide to do this. With strong pattern recognition, a ***LOT*** of discipline, and some common sense, you could definitely make a few extra $100s a month with this.\n\nTheme Pages - Find a niche (memes, beauty, cars, gaming, ect.) and make an instagram/yt/tiktok with it. After enough growth, companies will pay you thousands of dollars per post to promote their products/services. You could also do this to grow your own business, if you're interested in that.\n\nThese are the best ways that I know of that anyone could make an extra $1k a month. With all the information available to us nowadays, most of these are actually pretty easy, but they'll take a while, and you'll have to be extremely consistent, which is the real hard part.",

Running 10 fanpages though means you're probably drowning in repetitive DMs and comments asking the same stuff over and over, which cuts into time you could spend scaling or creating better content. One thing that might help with the engagement overload is setting up better automated responses for teh FAQ stuff.\n\nI've read about creators using tools like Isonic that convert your existing content into a chatbot so fans can get instant answers without you being glued to your phone. It supposedly helps capture sales from people who would otherwise just ghost after asking questions. Worth looking into if you're trying to monetize those fan interactions more efficiently without adding hours to your day.\n\nEither way, what you've built is solid. The fact that you're thinking about group calls and paid consultations shows you're already thinking like a real business owner.",

It is not exciting, but it is real money and fully remote. Downside is income ceiling is low.\n\nIf you are open to learning a skill  \nPick one boring but useful skill and go all in for 90 days. Stuff like basic web design (Webflow or WordPress), simple automation with no code tools, short form video editing, or customer support ops. These are not glamorous but people actually pay for them.\n\nFreelancing gets a bad rep, but if you focus on one narrow service instead of “I do everything”, it works. For example, “I edit short videos for coaches” or “I set up email flows for small ecommerce stores”.\n\nIf you want something semi passive later  \nContent plus a service. Use the 3 months to talk about what you are learning, build proof, then sell a small service or digital product. This takes longer, but it compounds.\n\nOne thing I would avoid is hopping between ideas every week. Three months is enough time to either make your first dollars or at least know exactly why something did not work.\n\nIf you want, tell me whether you care more about fast income or long term skill building and I can suggest something more specific.",

You can run this completely faceless while still keeping the \"human connection.\"\n\n1. The Concept: Create a channel hosted by a recurring \"Wise Character\" (like an Old Monk or a Stoic Philosopher).\n2. Why it works: People connect with a face, even if it's digital. It builds trust way better than just stock footage of a waterfall.\n3. How to do it: I use Keyvello for this.\n   - Disclosure: It has a Free Trial/Free Tier available to test.\n   - Use the \"Viral Wisdom\" template. It generates a realistic talking character (like a Monk) that lip-syncs your meditation script automatically.\n\nSince you have 3 months of free time, you could easily build a library of 50+ videos.

If they tap 4 or 5 stars, it redirects them to the business’s google review link\n3. If they tap 1 to 3 stars, it redirects them to a private feedback form instead (so the owner can fix it before it becomes a public 1-star)\n\nThat’s literally it , but reviews drive rankings plus potential new costumers, so owners actually care.\n\nSome people productize this as a monthly service ($150–$300/mo depending on niche). Not “get rich quick,” just a simple recurring offer if you can sell local, but I would say its very scalable.\n\nHappy to answer any questions or to share the setup, it took me like 20 mins to make. Feel free to give the vid a watch.\n\n(Edit): FYI, some people told me that the link in the vid doesn't work so I posted a comment with it.",

Dividends need rebalancing, side projects drift and even the low effort stuff punishes you if you completely ignore it. Lately I’ve been more focused on small, boring consistency. Not chasing home runs just stacking things that don’t demand daily attention. A little dividend reinvestment, some automated savings rules and occasionally parking small amounts where the risk is defined. I even mess around with tiny, disciplined bets from time to time, mostly as an exercise in restraint. Did one recently on Bracco while checking lines, set it and walked away, which honestly felt closer to passive than most things I’ve tried.  \n  \n  \nI want to know how others here define passive at this point.

      "selftext": "I just wanted to share my journey — I’m not selling anything or looking for DMs. I hope this motivates someone.\n\nI had a good salary and a comfortable life, but I wanted to live the digital nomad life with my family. I had zero knowledge of AI, automation, or software. ADHD helped in one way (ambition and optimism), but hurt in another (too many tools, monthly fees, and underuse). So I forced simplicity.\n\nOne day, alone in a hotel room with no phone, I spent hours talking to ChatGPT. I realised I didn’t lack ideas — I lacked *patterns*: what lots of people consistently want, urgently, and will pay for. So instead of asking “What can I launch fast?”, I asked “What system makes sense long-term?” I studied search behaviour in high-population countries, focusing on real pain, not curiosity. One rule: simple setup + fully automated.\n\nI tested a few options, picked one, and built it using a small stack:\n\n* **ChatGPT** for creativity and ideation\n* **Claude** to design/build the website and system\n* **Perplexity** for deep research.\n* Then I used **Cloudflare** (hosting and Workers automation), **Stripe** (payments), **MailerLite/Brevo** (emails), and **HTMLtoPDF** (to convert results into a PDF report).\n\nThe model was simple: a free personalised report for a specific sector, and a paid premium version delivered automatically. No calls, no onboarding, no consulting, no manual fulfilment. It runs on its own — and it has reached **€100k** in fully automated revenue.\n\nIf I can leave you with anything:\n\n* Build around real pain points\n* Think longer than feels comfortable before committing\n* Only execute when the model is aligned and simple\n* You don’t need to understand everything upfront — learn step by step\n\nGood luck to everyone.",

Since you’re already a doctor, I’d strongly suggest leaning into that rather than trying random “make money online” stuff.\n\nYou could look into medical writing, telehealth platforms, health content reviewing, or even tutoring med students. Those usually pay way better than generic online jobs and actually value your background. I’ve also seen doctors make decent money creating exam prep notes, selling study guides, or freelancing for healthcare startups.\n\nTry platforms like Upwork or LinkedIn and search specifically for medical-related roles instead of broad remote jobs. It might take a little time to land the first one, but once you do, it gets much easier.\n\nAlso please be careful with anything that sounds like “easy money” or requires upfront payment. Stick to things where your expertise is the selling point.\n\nYou’ve already done the hard part by becoming a doctor, now it’s just about positioning that skill online. Don’t undersell yourself.

What's actually working for me (and some of it s pretty uncommon):\n\nAmazon Associates. I have a few old blog posts that still convert. The 24-hour cookie is annoying but if the content is evergreen it just trickles in without me doing anything\n\nSoftware tools with recurring commissions. This one I really like. You refer someone to a tool like ConvertKit or Beehiiv, they stay subscribed, you get a cut every single month. Not a one-time $10 bonus, actual recurring income.\n\nHosting referrals. Wrote one tutorial two years ago. Still getting occasional payouts from it.\n\nTelegram creator tools. More niche but I refer people to service called Tribute, it's a platform for running paid groups on Telegram. They pay 2% of whatever that creator earns, indefinitely. Referred a few people who run active paid communities and now it just sits there and pays out. Not huge individually but it stacks. At one point i literally texted you-know-what-kind of creators offering then to join lmao it worked somehow tho\n\nThe pattern is kinda the same. Do something useful once, a post, a tutorial, a recommendation, and then forget about it. The ones that actually compound are always recurring commission models, not one-time payouts",

Always hearing about passive income online, but every time I look into it, it's either super technical or requires a ton of upfront cash. \n\n\n\nI tried the whole Etsy digital products thing last year – spent weeks making printables, listed them, and... crickets. Maybe made $50 over three months? Not exactly life-changing. Or maybe I just suck at marketing, who knows. \n\n\n\nAnyway, I was scrolling through some forums the other day (probably should've been sleeping), and stumbled on this thing called Bradley Woods Affiliate Mentor. It's an AI-powered system that automates affiliate marketing, claims you only need a $25 one-time investment and it runs 24/7. Sounds almost too good to be true, right? Like, I'm skeptical as hell because I've been burned by 'get-rich-quick' stuff before. But part of me is curious – has anyone here actually tried something like this? Or know if it's legit? \n\n\n\nWait, actually, I think I'm getting ahead of myself. The real question is: what passive income ideas have you all found that are actually sustainable without turning into a second job? I'm talking about stuff that, after you set it up, you can mostly forget about. \n\n\n\nFor context, I'm a dad with two kids, so time is tight. No tech skills either, which doesn't help. \n\n\n\nSo yeah, what's worked for you? Dividend investing? Rental properties with a manager? Or any online systems that are truly hands-off? And if you've dabbled in automated affiliate stuff, I'd love to hear your take – good or bad.",

I understand that there is an idle time, and for example, if you are actively reading and thinking for 3–5 minutes, Time Doctor may consider that idle time. It also seems that you cannot use the bathroom or take a short break between tasks to think, because it generates idle time.\n\nI would like to hear about the experiences of other remote workers who use Time Doctor. Do you have problems with idle time due to research or reading tasks?\n\nSome of you might say that I should have refused a job that uses a time tracker, as it could be a red flag that the company does not trust its employees. But to be honest, the job market is insane. It took me 4 months to find this job, and I feel I have nothing to lose. If I am not satisfied with the workplace, I will simply continue searching for another job.\n\nThank you in advance.",

Did anyone with zero experience get a job offer or are they hiring only those with experience? Any advice or insight would be great!

I just think they’re a very difficult company. If you’re fine with low pay, then you should be good.

I actually applied for several legal transcriptionist positions: eScribers, which I am in the orientation phase, Transcribeme, which I just submitted by second probation file to see if I am accepted into \"Legal Phoenix\"... A couple of others that I have not made it passed the initial part yet / they do not seem as big of companies, as the 3 main ones are... Casting Words &amp; Transcription Hub. I have done a bit of research, and it looks like between the 3.. Allegis pays the highest, then eScribers, then Transcribeme. Transcribeme, is strictly download the files read them and learn on your own. Once you make it past the legal tests, there is a group you can ask questions to. eScribers, once you get to the interview and decide you want to give it a try, they give you a mentor. There is actually a lot more technical pieces to eScribers than Transcibeme from what I see so far, but I enjoy it more.\n\nI have read that with Allegis, if you are offered the phone interview you are basically in, just like eScribers, however someone else mentioned above that was not the case for them so maybe that is incorrect. I have read that you have to commit to a min. of 20 hours per week as well. Again, not confirmed just what I read. I am not sure if you have tried any of the other transcription places, but if you have not, I would definitely recommend attempting Transcribme's legal tests. Just try passing them alone will give you a significant amount of knowledge that can help you with transcribing in general. The way that they have their system set up is definitely entry level friendly. Good Luck on your interview, I'm sure you will do great, but if you do not. Don't sweat try one of these other companies!",

      "selftext": "\n\nBeen looking at a lot of deal flow over the past 6-8 months and theres a pattern I keep noticing that I think is worth talking about. Not every type of online business is trending the same direction valuation-wise. Some categories are compressing, some are flat, and a few are quietly getting more expensive to acquire. I wanted to break down the three I keep seeing come up.\n\n\n\nFirst one is vertical SaaS for non-tech industries. Think software built for plumbers, dentists, property managers, small logistics companies. These industries are digitizing but they're doing it slowly and with very few options. Which means when someone builds a tool that actually works for, say, a regional plumbing company to manage scheduling and invoicing... that customer is not leaving. Ever. They're not browsing G2 on weekends looking for alternatives. They found something, it works, their admin person learned it, and thats that.\n\n\n\nI've seen vertical SaaS tools with pretty modest MRR, like $15-30k range, get competing offers because acquirers understand that the switching costs are massive and the TAM is still expanding. These industries haven't even scratched the surface of software adoption. Monthly churn on some of these is sub-2%, sometimes closer to 1.1-1.4%. Multiples are creeping up because buyers are pricing in the retention and the runway, not just current revenue.\n\n\n\nSecond category is one I find genuinely interesting. Productized services that are converting into software. So imagine a company that started doing manual SEO audits as a done-for-you service. Charging $500-800 per audit, doing maybe 40-60 a month. Then they build a tool that automates like 80% of the audit process. Now they've got proven demand (people already pay for this), improving margins because delivery is getting cheaper, and a path toward full SaaS economics.\n\n\n\nThese are fascinating from a buyer perspective because you're not guessing whether people want the thing. You already know they do. You're just watching the margin structure improve over time. I looked at one of these last year where gross margins went from 41% to 68% over 14 months just from automating parts of their fulfillment. The revenue barely changed but the business got dramatically more valuable.\n\n\n\nThird is micro-SaaS with integration or API plays. Small tools that plug into bigger ecosystems... Shopify apps, Salesforce integrations, Slack bots, tools that are Zapier-native. The thing about these is distribution is partially solved by the platform itself. You're not spending $4k/month on paid acquisition hoping your landing page converts. People find you in the app store while they're already looking for a solution.\n\n\n\nAnd once your tool is embedded in someone's workflow, the stickiness is insane. I looked at a Shopify app doing $22k MRR that had net revenue retention of like 113% because existing users kept upgrading as their stores grew. The app just grew with them. Churn was there but expansion revenue more than covered it.\n\n\n\nWhat I think is actually driving all three of these trends is the same underlying thing. Buyers are getting smarter about what \"defensible\" actually means. It's not about having a patent or some proprietary algorithm. It's about structural switching costs, embedded workflows, and expanding TAMs in categories where competition is still thin. Those three things together are what's making acquirers pay up.\n\n\n\nIf you're building in one of these categories and wondering whether the market values what you're doing... it probably does more than you think. And if you're not in one of these categories, I'm not saying your business isn't valuable, but it might be worth thinking about whether theres a way to move toward one of these dynamics. The margin structure one especially. I keep seeing sellers underestimate how much a clear trajectory matters to buyers even when the current numbers are mid.\n\n\n\nAnyway just patterns I've been noticing. Could be wrong about where things go from here but the deal data over the last year or so has been pretty consistent on this stuff.",

Figured people searching for \"Card A vs Card B\" are probably ready to apply.\n\nFirst five months were dead. Like maybe 150 visitors total by September. I was writing twice a week, following all the SEO advice, but nothing was happening. Started thinking I picked the wrong niche.\n\nOctober things started moving. Traffic went from nothing to around 500 visitors a day. I was checking Google Analytics constantly. November hit 780. By December I was at 950 daily visitors and made $2,100 that month. I remember sitting at my desk just staring at the dashboard because I couldn't believe it was real.\n\nJanuary I made $2,800. Traffic was still around 950 a day, maybe 1,000 on good days. Thought okay this is it, it's going to keep growing.\n\nNow it's February and I'm still at 950 visitors. Revenue is around $2,600 this month so far. It's just stuck there. Traffic isn't growing at all.\n\nI've got 61 posts published. Still doing two per week like I have been. But new posts aren't ranking. My best post is a credit card comparison that ranks number 3 and makes about $740 a month by itself. I've written four more comparison posts trying to copy that success. None of them rank past page 2.\n\nThe posts that already rank are fine. They're not moving up but they're not dropping either. It's like I hit my ceiling.\n\nI started adding comparison tables in January. Like actual side by side breakdowns of fees and rewards. Takes longer to build but I thought it would help. Haven't seen any ranking changes yet. Maybe it's too soon, I don't know.\n\nGot an email list too. Around 620 people now. Growing maybe 25 a week. When I email about a new post I usually get a few signups. Email probably drives 10 or 15 percent of revenue but it's hard to track because people click through and apply later.\n\nConversion rate is around 1.4% which seems okay for finance. Most signups come from the comparison posts where I break down which card is better for specific situations. Takes way longer to write but people seem to trust it more.\n\nTried making some explainer videos in December. Used Canva for graphics and messed around with APOB and a couple other tools to make talking head style videos without showing my face. Made like three videos explaining credit card rewards programs. Got maybe 200 views total on YouTube. Took forever to put together so I gave up on that pretty quick.\n\nTried guest posting in January. Reached out to maybe 30 finance blogs. Got two guest posts published. Saw zero change in rankings.\n\nAlso tried Facebook ads for like two weeks in November. Spent around $240 targeting people interested in credit cards. Got maybe 160 clicks and literally zero applications. Not even one. Thought my tracking was broken but nope, just zero conversions. Stopped that immediately.\n\nTried Twitter too. Posted tips and linked to my posts for like three weeks. Got maybe 80 followers and like 20 clicks total. Waste of time.\n\nI post on Reddit sometimes in personal finance subs when I can actually help without being promotional. Drives maybe 100 visitors a month but most of them bounce anyway.\n\nUsing Ahrefs for keywords. $99 a month which sucks.\n\nWhat's frustrating is I don't know what changed. Traffic was growing every month from October to December. Then it stopped. I'm doing the same stuff. Same quality, same keywords, same everything.\n\nAlso seeing bigger sites like NerdWallet and The Points Guy covering the same cards I write about. They have way more authority so I'm probably screwed competing with them. Trying to find more specific angles like \"best credit cards for small business owners under 30\" but those get barely any searches.\n\nSpending maybe 18 hours a week on this. Writing takes forever when you have to research all the terms and conditions.\n\nTraffic is flat. Revenue is basically flat. New posts aren't ranking.\n\nDid Google change something in December or January? I keep seeing people talk about algorithm updates but I can't tell if I got hit.\n\nAnyone else stuck like this? I keep going back and forth on whether I should just keep doing what I'm doing or try something completely different. But I don't even know what different would look like. Like should I stop writing new posts and just update the ones that already rank? Should I try to get more backlinks even though guest posting didn't work? Should I just wait it out?\n\nI don't know. Some days I think I just need to be patient. Other days I think I'm wasting my time.",

But the click-through is super strong.    \n\nI think the old wisdom would be to establish authority: build out pages that are not just obvious affiliate opportunities, more “everything you need to know”. Content pillars around credit itself, the factors in it, how to build credit, what is a good mix of credit cards, etc. might help. \n\nI think if Google looks at your site and thinks you’re only producing content to earn commissions, you’ll be pushed less. Are you an expert in the field? If so, do you have an about page listing your credentials, methodology, etc?

      "selftext": "TL;DR: Two-thirds of Skimlinks programs have no click data. The median EPC is $0.14. Commission rate is the wrong thing to optimize - EPC is. Interactive report with full data in comments.\n\nI pulled every program on Skimlinks (\\~29k) and categorized against a clean set of verticals. Here's what stood out.\n\n**1. There are way more dead programs than you'd expect.**\n\nOf 28,844 programs listed, 19,191 (66.5%) have no click data - no EPC, no conversion rate, no basket size. They're in the directory, but there's no evidence clicks are converting.\n\nSome could be new listings or programs that are primarily active on other networks. But even if you're generous and assume a quarter of them are just new -that still means roughly half the catalog is dead weight. The actual pool of programs generating real earnings is far smaller than the directory makes it look.\n\n**2. Commission rate is the wrong way to pick programs. EPC is better (when you have it).**\n\nCommission rate is the vanity metric everyone chases. \"This program pays 12%!\" But it ignores basket size and conversion rate - the two things that actually determine what you earn per click.\n\nEPC (earnings per click) = commission rate × average basket size × conversion rate. It captures the full picture in one number.\n\nHere are the top 10 programs on the entire Skimlinks network by EPC:\n\n|Program|EPC|Commission|Avg Basket|CVR|What's driving it|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Akind DE|$15.41|12.4%|$361|34.5%|Monster CVR|\n|ZenBusiness|$12.40|37.1%|$227|14.7%|High commission × high CVR|\n|GuestReady|$9.25|5.0%|$633|29.2%|Huge basket × huge CVR|\n|RajaniMD|$9.10|15.9%|$184|31.2%|High commission × monster CVR|\n|Ivim Health|$7.94|21.4%|$524|7.1%|Big basket × high commission|\n|Misha and Puff|$7.35|20.0%|$300|12.3%|Premium pricing × solid CVR|\n|smava|$7.33|1.5%|$20,628|2.4%|$20k basket - commission is irrelevant|\n|Cloud Water Filters|$6.64|58.2%|$354|3.2%|Extreme commission|\n|WECREAT TECH|$6.19|8.0%|$1,168|6.6%|$1k+ basket does the work|\n|Beeksebergen|$4.85|6.6%|$684|10.8%|Holiday rental - big basket × solid CVR|\n\nNot one of these would rank near the top if you sorted by commission rate alone. smava pays 1.5% commission and earns $7.33 per click because the average order is $20,000. GuestReady pays 5% and earns $9.25 because people book $633 stays and convert at 29%.\n\nThere are really only two equations that produce high EPC:\n\n**Big basket × modest commission** \\- travel, accommodation, finance, high-ticket goods. You don't need a high commission when someone books a $1,700 hotel stay at 5%.\n\n**High commission × high CVR** \\- health, business, education. Smaller baskets but 10–30% conversion rates. Volume compensates.\n\nThe trap is picking programs with moderate everything. Decent commission, average basket, average CVR. That's where most programs live and it's where EPC goes to die.\n\n**3. These patterns hold across every vertical.**\n\nI classified all 9,323 programs with EPC data into 21 verticals (using cross-network data from CJ, Impact, FlexOffers, and Awin to fix Skimlinks' messy categorization). The same two paths show up at the category level:\n\n|Vertical|Programs|Avg EPC|Avg Basket|CVR|Commission|What's working|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Finance &amp; Insurance|58|$0.66|$1,277|5.0%|12.2%|Big basket|\n|Jewellery|136|$0.43|$383|3.5%|8.4%|Big basket|\n|Travel &amp; Accommodation|444|$0.40|$612|3.5%|6.4%|Big basket|\n|Health &amp; Wellness|646|$0.35|$100|5.4%|10.6%|High CVR|\n|Sports &amp; Outdoors|404|$0.34|$217|4.6%|6.6%|Balanced|\n|...|||||||\n|Software &amp; Technology|142|$0.22|$69|2.1%|31.6%|Nothing - CVR kills it|\n\n(6 of 21 verticals. Full breakdown in the interactive report.)\n\nFinance earns $0.66/click on a $1,277 basket at just 12.2% commission. Software has the highest commission rate of any vertical (31.6%) and the lowest EPC ($0.22) because almost nobody converts (2.1% CVR).\n\n**4. The EPC distribution is brutal.**\n\nOf the 9,356 programs with a measurable EPC:\n\n* 46% earn less than $0.10 per click\n* The median is $0.14\n* Only 5.7% break $1.00\n* Just 9 programs in the entire network exceed $5.00\n\nThe distribution is massively right-skewed. Most programs cluster between $0.01 and $0.25. If you're picking programs without checking EPC, you're almost certainly landing in that pile.\n\n**5. The one thing to take from this:**\n\nSort by EPC, not commission rate. If a network doesn't show you EPC, calculate it from basket size and conversion rate. If they don't show you those either, that's a red flag in itself.\n\nThe interactive report has the full vertical breakdown with reversal rates, the top 20 programs ranked by EPC, EPC distribution charts, and a commission-vs-EPC scatter plot; below.\n\nThis is one network. I'm building the same analysis across CJ, Impact, ShareASale, Rakuten, Awin, and others - a free directory that surfaces EPC, basket size, conversion rates, reversal rates, and commission structures across 50,000+ listings. More on that in comments.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the data or methodology.\n\n*Data: 28,844 programs on Skimlinks, 9,356 with non-zero EPC. Vertical classification used cross-network category matching against CJ, FlexOffers, Impact, Awin, and others, with Skimlinks categories and manual review as fallback. All 9,323 programs with EPC data classified across 21 verticals. EPC/basket/CVR averages use non-zero values only. Full methodology in the interactive report.*",

Think old-school directories, but cleaner and searchable.\n\nThe issue is that I have traffic but no **revenue** right now.\n\nI don’t really want to use AdSense.  \nNot because of earnings only, but because:  \n• approval is annoying  \n• I’ve seen accounts randomly banned  \n• Ads don’t match directory users very well  \n• It makes the site look spammy\n\nWhat I’m trying to find is something more “integrated”.\n\nWhat I mean:  \nIdeally, I’d like a monetisation method where I can **add a code/script to my site** that automatically displays relevant content (listings, offers, tools, widgets, etc.) instead of traditional banner ads.\n\nBasically:  \nnot popups  \nnot gambling ads  \nnot shady downloads\n\nMore like:  \n— contextual marketplace  \n— sponsored listings  \n— useful widgets  \n— something that fits a directory\n\nI already thought about:  \n• paid submissions  \n• featured listings\n\nBut I feel I’m missing something smarter that other directory owners use.\n\nSo my question to people who run sites:  \n**What monetisation methods actually worked for you on informational or directory websites that are NOT AdSense?**\n\nEspecially if it’s something that can be installed via a code snippet or a widget.\n\nI’m open to anything — affiliate networks, APIs, widgets, SaaS partnerships, etc.\n\nWould really appreciate real experiences rather than theory.\n\nThanks 🙏",

Most of these companies are run by skilled tradespeople who are great at the work but terrible at consistent follow-up. The ones who figure out predictable lead flow scale fast because the bottleneck is almost never the service quality, it's the pipeline.\n\nCurious about your tech stack for this. Are you running SMS campaigns through something like Twilio or using a platform, and are you building the automation yourself or using off-the-shelf tools? The margin difference between those two approaches is massive at scale.\n\nAlso, one thing I've seen work well for local service lead gen: once you nail the playbook for one vertical (say pressure washing), the same system usually transfers to adjacent verticals with minimal tweaking. Landscaping, HVAC, roofing. The outreach mechanics are nearly identical, just different keywords and seasonal patterns. That's where the real compounding happens.",

To reach the next level, you need to build a Structure (systems and lead-gen flows) that works even when you take a breath. You’ve proven you can survive; now it’s time to prove you can build a legacy that doesn't depend solely on your daily adrenaline.\n\nKeep building with that same 'stubborn hope.'

      "selftext": "Cold calling isn't dead. Bad cold calling is dead. I tracked every call this month and the data tells a clear story.\n\nOut of 820 dials, I got 124 connects which is about 16 percent connect rate. Of those connects, 32 turned into real conversations over 3 minutes. And 12 of those became booked meetings.\n\nThe math breaks down to roughly 72 calls per meeting. Not amazing, but profitable when your deal size is right.\n\nHere's what I learned about openers this month. I tested three different approaches across roughly equal call volumes. The pattern interrupt opener where I said something unexpected like \"Hey this is a cold call, you can hang up but give me 18 seconds first\" got 30 percent to stay on the line past 30 seconds. The permission-based opener where I asked \"Did I catch you at a bad time\" got 22 percent. The direct pitch where I immediately explained why I was calling got only 14 percent.\n\nThe pattern interrupt felt awkward at first but the data was clear. People appreciate honesty about what's happening.\n\nOn timing, I found that Tuesday through Thursday between 10 AM and 11:30 AM had the highest connect rates at 19 percent. Monday mornings were brutal at 9 percent. Friday afternoons were dead at 5 percent. I stopped calling Fridays after lunch entirely.\n\nThe biggest insight was about follow-up after missed calls. I left 310 voicemails. Got 7 callbacks. That's barely 1 percent. But when I stopped leaving voicemails and instead sent a quick LinkedIn message within 5 minutes of the missed call, I got 22 responses from 156 attempts. That's 14 percent. The multi-touch approach crushed voicemail-only.\n\nMy current approach is to call, if no answer send immediate LinkedIn connection with a note referencing the call, then follow up with email the next day. This three-channel approach within 24 hours gets way better results than any single channel alone.\n\nThe psychology behind why this works is simple. People are busy. They miss calls all the time. But when they see the same person tried to reach them through multiple channels, it signals importance. It also creates familiarity. By the time they see your email, they've already seen your name twice.\n\nThe reps on my team who adopted this approach saw their meeting rates increase by 37 percent within the first month. The ones who stuck to single-channel calling stayed flat.\n\nCold calling works but it's not about the call anymore. It's about how the call fits into a larger sequence. The phone is the start of the conversation, not the whole thing.\n\nIf you're still measuring success by calls made, you're missing the point. Measure conversations started across all channels. That's what actually predicts revenue.",

The woman got straight to the point. It came as a little shock at first but she asked me 2 or 3 simple questions and I answered. I didn’t need the product and the last question was, am I interested. I said no and she hung up with a simple goodbye. After the call, I was convinced it was a bot. I also realised it didn’t annoy me like a sales call usually does but that might have been due to the fact that it was new and surprised me. I’m sure getting 10 of these calls a day would be annoying. I need to make cold calls for my business and I avoid it like the plague. I know it’s the game but when I know how much it annoys me, I can’t do it to others. I think I might have to look more into the AI bot thing for my own business.",

You are basically saying I respect your time enough to be upfront about what this is. Most people are so used to being tricked into conversations that honesty becomes the differentiator.\n\n  \nThe Friday afternoon stat made me laugh because we had the exact same experience.

When you signal \"this might not be for you,\" their brain flips from evaluating to wanting.\n\n  \nWhen it works best: prospects who are comparison shopping or skeptical.

Also great with higher-ticket deals where the buyer expects to be sold hard.\n\n  \nWhen to skip it: early stage prospects who barely know what they need yet.

What worked for me was being specific about WHY they might not be a fit, not just vaguely saying \"we're not for everyone.\" Like \"honestly, if your team isn't ready to change their current workflow, this won't help you.\" That way you're filtering for real fit, not just playing a psychology trick.

          "body": "The reason this works isn't just \"removing pressure.\" It works because you accidentally started doing the one thing most founders never do - actually listening to the customer's problem instead of pitching your solution.\n\n  \nWhen you told the prospect they might not be a good fit, you forced THEM to articulate why they need you. In that moment they gave you better product insight than any survey or feedback form ever would. They told you their exact pain, in their words, with real urgency. That's gold.\n\n  \nThink about what happened: instead of you saying \"here's what our product does,\" the customer said \"here's why I need this.\" The information flow reversed. And the information going the other direction - customer to you - is always more valuable than your pitch going the other way.\n\n  \nThe question of when to use it comes down to whether you're selling to people who already know they have the problem. If they reached out to you, they know. Anti-selling just makes them articulate it clearly. If you're cold outreach, they might not know they have the problem yet, and anti-selling gives them an easy exit.",

      "selftext": "I quit my job as Head of Growth at a fintech to build my own thing. Had savings, had a co-founder, had what I thought was a great idea. So we went dark for 8 months and built.\n\nNo blog. No social media. No talking to potential customers. Just heads down building because I was convinced someone would steal the idea if we talked about it. Looking back thats embarrassing to admit but at the time it felt like strategy.\n\nWe launched to nothing. Not criticism. Not rejection. Just silence. The kind of silence where you refresh your analytics dashboard 40 times a day and the number stays at zero. My co-founder and I sat in a coffee shop the day after launch staring at each other like \"now what.\"\n\nThe product wasnt bad. We actually got decent feedback from the few people who tried it. The problem was that nobody knew we existed and we had zero relationships with the people we were building for. Eight months of building and we hadnt talked to a single potential customer.\n\nHeres what I do completely differently now:\n\nI dont build anything until Ive talked to at least 30 people who have the problem Im trying to solve. Not surveys. Actual conversations. Most of them will tell you things that make you uncomfortable. Thats the point.\n\nI build in public now. Not in the cringey \"day 47 of my startup journey\" way. But I talk about what Im working on, what problems Im seeing, what Im learning. The people who engage with that become your first users.\n\nI stopped being precious about the idea. Nobody is going to steal your startup idea. Execution is everything and most people cant even execute on their own ideas let alone yours.\n\nThe stealth mode thing felt like strategy but it was actually fear. I was afraid of putting something imperfect out there. I was afraid of hearing that maybe the thing I was building didnt matter. Stealth mode is just expensive procrastination disguised as strategy.\n\nIf you are reading this and you are currently in stealth mode, stop. Go talk to 10 people this week about what you are building. The discomfort you feel doing that is the exact work you are avoiding.",

I learned the hard way that 'crunch mode' isn't a badge of honor; it’s just debt that you eventually pay back with interest (usually burnout or health issues).\n\nTo your list, I would add: 'divorce your ego' from the metrics. Especially in the early days, it is so easy to feel like you are a failure just because a launch failed or growth is slow (feeling this now!). I have to constantly remind myself; especially now that I'm back in university and building a startup simultaneously, that the business is an experiment, not a judgment on my character. :)\n\nIf I tie my self-worth to the MRR graph, I’m on an emotional roller coaster I can’t survive (I feel). Learning to be 'okay' even when the business is broken is the only superpower that keeps me in the game! 🦸‍♂️",

      "selftext": "So I wasted like 3.5 years trying every productivity system. Bought some $150 Notion template from a YouTuber (embarrassing). Did the whole Todoist thing, Obsidian, bullet journals, all of it.\n\nBasically I wasn't actually working. Just organizing my work and feeling productive about organizing. Being busy doesnt equal getting important shit done.\n\nEvery morning id open whatever app and see like 40+ tasks, spend 20 minutes moving shit around and color coding it. Then do one easy task and call it a day. The actual important stuff? Always \"tomorrow\"\n\nI had 40 tasks every day. Would finish maybe 1. The other 39 just sitting there judging me. Way too many to even know where to start so I'd just pick whatever seemed easiest.\n\nThe list was the whole problem.\n\nSo i said fuck it and deleted everything, every app, every so called productivity tool. Bought a small whiteboard from around the corner.\n\nMade one rule: only what fits on here matters today. That's it.\n\nWrote 3 tasks. Not 40. Just the 3 actual important things I need to do to get closer to my goals. Things that can actually be done in a workday.\n\nWith only a few realistic tasks, you can't hide anymore. With 40 tasks theres always an excuse like \"oh ill do that big one after i knock out these 5 quick things\" but with 3? You either do them or you dont and you know it.\n\nWhen I finished something I'd get up, walk over, cross it off with this red marker. It stayed there all day with the line through it. Could actually see what i did. Which gives me some validation that I am moving forward.\n\nThis worked amazing! No anxiety, no busyness. Just getting shit done.\n\nMy buddy came over and just started reading my tasks out loud. \"Yo whats this project about?\" Just reading my whole board.\n\nSame thing on video calls, people asked about the whiteboard behind me, trying to read it.\n\nAnd I work from home so its in my living space. In the evening trying to get a clear head and my tasks are right there staring at me.\n\nBut i couldn't hide it because seeing it was the entire point. That was the whole system.\n\nSo I got this idea, what if it just flips. One side is the whiteboard for tasks. Other side is just clean wood that actually looks good on a wall without office vibes. No art needed, just nice &amp; clean looking surface.\n\nTook me forever to figure out how to make it light enough to actually flip easily and stick with magnetic fixation. Tried a bunch of materials that were either too heavy or looked like crap. Went through like 10 different prototypes. Tested several concepts, some worked great but i just didnt like them aesthetically so i moved on until something clicked.\n\nReal lesson tho is 3 tasks you actually finish beats 40 tasks you organize and never do. Less isnt limiting its just focus. Being busy doesnt always equals getting shit done.\n\nObviously this is the polished version. There were a LOT of ups and downs in between.",

They make you feel busy without making progress on anything that matters. When you only have 3 things, you cant hide behind \"oh ill do the hard one after these quick wins\" because there are no quick wins to hide behind.\n\n  \nThe physical aspect is key too. Something about writing by hand and physically crossing things off hits different than checking a box in an app. I think its because digital tools are too forgiving. You can drag, snooze, reschedule, archive. A whiteboard just stares at you.\n\n  \nThe privacy problem you ran into is interesting too and honestly a good sign. It means the system is visible enough to actually hold you accountable. Thats the whole point. The flip mechanism sounds like a clean solution to that.\n\n  \nCurious how many prototypes you went through before landing on the magnetic fixation.

Sprint planning sessions that took half a day, Jira boards with 200 tickets, elaborate story point systems. We stripped it back to a simple rule: every morning, each person writes down the one thing that moves the project forward today. Not three things. One. If they finish early, great, pick another.

You set a deletion timer for a thought/task and have to refresh it each day if it stays important to your goals. For me it'd be about 7 days. I'd dump my ideas into the journal, rank them by importance, then recall them using auto fill (app would keep record of 7 days of blurbs). If I didn't think about it again for 7 days, it would be deleted and gone forever.

That gap between “this is exciting” and “I actually know what I’m doing” is where almost everyone drops off. If I started from zero I’d train myself to sit in that gap longer.",

It really is a journey, not a destination. There's no biological clock ticking here.\n\nYou have to understand with business.You must bring value to the marketplace.Because it doesn't give a shit about your wants or needs.It will only reward value if you survive.\n\nThere's a reason most successful business owners are in their forties.\n\nYou're a baby on the timeline.\n\nDisregard the do what you're passionate about bullshit.\nDon't look for shortcuts.Because the secret is buried in the work that everyone's trying to avoid always take the hard path. It pays the best in the long run.\n\nHere's what you need.\n\nSkills \nKnowledge \nExperience \nCharacter \nTime\n\nThe good news is, you can get all of those things from just about any job in the world. Even multiple jobs if you bounce around. Any job that can make payroll consistently is further ahead than most small businesses. They've already survived the cut.\n\nI recommend sales. Even if and even if you're an introvert like me.And if you suck at it, because you suck at everything you start at. Anyone can do it. There's also no limit on how much you can make or learn or grow.\n\nWhatever job you get, whatever industry you work in.Because you have to pay your bills. You're gonna spend more time there than you will with those that you love or the things that you love.That's life it's unfair and nobody's coming to save you.\n\nSo be the best at your job, even if it means you're not getting paid for it be better than that. I treated every job like I owned the company. Then, when you're not at work, work harder on yourself than you do your job.\n\nYou have to understand to run a business in the early years.You're doing everything by yourself.With no capital and very little time. You need to be able to do the sales, the order fulfillment, the purchasing, the marketing, the managing, the finances and quickbooks, and the hiring and firing.\n\nLearn every one of those roles at whatever company you're at, by just being curious, which is a skill set.And helpful. The people that are employed that say, well, that's not my job.Or I don't get paid enough to do that.Those are the unhelpful fucking people and they don't learn shit.\n\nDon't be that guy.\n\nSpend ten years building you while paying your bills. Listen to biographies on founder's podcast, all of them over and over again. You will learn so much more at different times of your life.From biographies than you will from any other business book that i've read.And i've got a fucking library like literally a library, and we're building a library in the town we live in so two fucking libraries. Personal and public because when you make a shitload of money, you should build libraries.\n\nBuild your skills.\nQuickbooks is definitely top of the list on financial tools. When you get a couple paychecks, buy an old desktop version and create a fake company with fake vendors. Fake customers fake invoices, fake bank accounts fake credit cards, fake purchasing fake, receiving and play business in that sandbox until you master quickbooks. When you get hung up on something, go online and look at youtube. OR work on your networking and social engineering skills and make friends with the people that are in the accounting department, payroll department accounts, receivable, payable department at your job and ask them, hey, my wife and I are hung up on this with our quick books.How would you get through this?\n\nPeople love to help when it's something they're good at.\n\nVolunteer some hours late at night, or on the weekend to help the warehouse.Get orders out when they're busier to do inventory at the job that you work. Help I t set up new computers and monitors for the new salespeople or whatever when you get a chance. Don't count the cost.\n\nStudy, whatever industry you're in, find out who the top five players are.And see what they do to come to market differently from the company.That you're in currently. Why do they do it? How did the company work for start? Who is the first person that got hired?And why? Learn everything about the supply chains and the distribution chains and the channels to market and the customers themselves.\n\nAll of these things will paint a picture for you.And you will understand where you're at better than anyone around you.That's just punching a clock doing their job.Because you're not paid to do all that extra shit.\n\nOver the years, you're gonna build up undeniable skill, sets experiences and knowledge.And your character's gonna develop, because character's not just being honest.I'm a good guy.I've got good character, no, it's resilience.It's fortitude, it's perseverance.It's living outside your comfort zone to where you can't even see the fucking boundary.Because it's so far away and you're so uncomfortable.But that's where you grow.That's the gift!\n\nOver time years for me, it was decades. You'll start to see things and question em and dig and research further.And then bring them to the owners of the company and say, what if we did this differently like this. Don't bring it to him until you have a plan.As if you were gonna bring it to market that day. They're gonna tell you someone older, smarter.Wiser, more educated, more experienced would have done it.If it was possible or even the arrogant owner themselves will tell you they would have done it. But if you've proven yourself as undeniably valuable at your job, they're gonna say, if you want to mess with that, go ahead, mess with it.In your free time.\n\nHere's where you get to build more experience. You get to bring something to market and you won't get credit for it.And you won't get paid for it.In most cases, you'll make a company a lot of money.And you'll just get screwed.\n\nBut they can't take the skills or the knowledge or the experience or the character that you get to build in that process away from you.\n\nYour character is a soft component.It's your personal value.\n\nYou can't find something if you don't already have it. You must find something of value and bring it to the marketplace.But first you have to become valuable.\n\nThis is what i've done.And it's worked every time. It's not the short path. It's not the easiest path. But anyone can do it. When you get further down the path, you can reply to me and I'll help you with the how too's.\n\nIt's worth it.",

Most people do not start with a clear business idea that feels meant for them, that usually comes after doing something boring or messy first. The internet makes it look like everyone woke up with a genius concept, but in reality most ideas are discovered through action, not thinking.\n\nGiven your situation, unemployed, low capital, not technical, working from home, you are actually in a good spot for service based things rather than products or SaaS. Services look unsexy but they teach you sales, communication, and problem solving fast, and those skills transfer to almost any business later. You do not need to love the idea, you just need to tolerate it enough to learn from it.\n\nThe trap you want to avoid is waiting for clarity before starting. Clarity usually shows up after you have tried a few things and failed a bit. Pick something small, cheap, and reversible, give it a few months, and see what you learn. Even if it does not work, it will make the next idea much clearer.\n\nNot knowing what you want to build yet does not mean you are behind.

Okay, so basically, I was in the same scenarios where you are right now. And like I was struggling with almost seven years. I was, I have been confusion while choosing what should I do? Should I do job? Should I do my own business? And then after that, when I decided I will do my own job, then what kind of job, what kind of business, what kind of products? I mean, I was always confused because the main reason was what I noticed in like seven to eight years when I was struggling with these kind of things, I was struggling with my own thoughts. I noticed I was comparing with myself with others' people and thinking that I am a slow person. I'm thinking that I do not have the capability to do something. Okay, instead I have to do, I have to work on my skill.\n\nI was just noticing others' people's stories, just like you are doing right now. So that pattern, I also had that time. So it is called a validation, you can say. Taking validation from external. And this happens when, when you don't know your own voice, when you don't know what is your belief. Because your beliefs are not your beliefs, okay, right now. Your beliefs are from The world that shaped  you from the people around you that you. So what pattern I have noticed in myself and I think you should also notice in yourself, maybe you can relate with me. So I'm just honestly sharing my journey a little bit.\n\nSo maybe it will help you out. First of all, taking validation, yeah. What do i mean by taking validation? If I am comparing with other people. Even though I know the whole thing that, okay, social media is fake, still, still my belief are not trusting that thoughts. They believe that, yes, I am slow or not doing anything because of reality because your are not doing anything that's why you think alot.. okay. \n\nSo I was always talking negative about myself because I was comparing, I was taking validation. I was not sure what to do i had no comfidnce, I wanted to do something, but not for me that time. I wanted to do something for the world, for other people to show, show up, you can say. So I was not even honest with myself. Right now, what ever I'm sharing, I faced my honesty, truth. I set with my ugly thoughts after seven to eight years, I got to realize that these are the patterns and the root cause was different.\n\nThe root cause was just one thing. And that was... I just have to believe myself. I just do not have to show everyone. I just do not have to prove anyone. I don't have to prove anyone in this world. I just have to be with myself and just try to figure out the root cause of what's I'm dealing with it. Because it's not about the business or anything. It's about what's going on in your world. What's the thing that affected that you are believing like this? \n\nWhat do you adapt in your circumstance that you are talking negative about yourself? I mean, there are lots of things that I wanted to share with you, but that's the pattern I noticed. The main thing is, I would say that stop taking validation it will be hard at first and I would just suggest you recommend one thing. Just sit in silence with yourself  I mean, no phone, no nothing. I would also  suggest you go for lak . Just go for a walk in the park and just notice around, what people are doing. And just do walk at least 10 to 15 minutes.

Most real businesses start as “this kinda sucks, I’ll try to make it slightly better.” Boring &gt; brilliant. Don’t pre-optimize problems you don’t have. Tons of legit businesses start from a bedroom with zero paperwork at the beginning. Product vs service: services are usually easier when you’re broke and inexperienced. Product businesses are harder, slower, and riskier early on. You don’t need to be an expert yet. Pick something you’re slightly better at than average or willing to learn fast.\n\nAlso: SaaS being “trendy” doesn’t mean it’s the path. I didn’t code when I started either. Most people learn after committing, not before.\n\nThe biggest trap is waiting until you feel “ready” or confident. That day never comes. Start tiny, embarrassingly tiny.

You've already answered that elsewhere (Actually, before even asking the PvS question) by telling us about your lack of resources. If you lack resources, then service is THE way to go, at least initially. Nothing you do is ever set in stone, so you can pivot into production later, when you have the resources to do so. \n\nYou mentioned business consulting or PR. Those are tough to sell at your age without a proven track record. Look for \"doing\" services instead of \"advising\" services. Can you manage social media? Can you write copy? Can you edit short-form video? Can you handle basic administrative tasks for a local business?\n\nHere's what I'd do to start (Remember, this is just advice, not THE way to go) Pick one boring service, find one person who needs it, and try to make $100 or equivelant. Once you do that, the \"cloud\" of ideas usually starts to clear because you're actually in the game instead of watching from the sidelines. Have you ever heard that it's easier to find a job when you already have one? The same applies here, once you're actually IN THERE doing SOMETHING, no matter how small, you'll find more oppurtunities.\n\nThe very best advice I can give... NEVER be afraid to fail.",

The average deal is around $100K, and the lifetime client value sits around $350K as they re-up.\n\nHere's the thing: almost all of that came from me and my network. Every time we've tried to bring on a salaried salesperson, it's been the same story. Pay them for months, they don't close anything, and we're out a chunk of cash we could've reinvested into the business. It's happened multiple times now, and honestly, it's one of the most frustrating parts of scaling.\n\nSo we shifted our thinking. We put together what I think is a solid commission structure:\n\n* 10% on the initial downpayment\n* 5% on all recurring revenue from their clients\n* 30% of anything sold above our base proposal (so if we quote $100K and they close at $130K, they keep 30% of that $30K)\n\nWe'd also cover conference tickets and events since that's a big part of how deals happen in this space.\n\nOn a typical deal, that's around $10K upfront with recurring income over the client's lifetime. Not bad for someone who knows how to sell and doesn't need their hand held.\n\nBut I genuinely cannot figure out where to find people who are actually good at sales AND willing to work commission. Every platform I've tried is either flooded with people who want a base salary no matter what, or with people who talk a big game but don't deliver.\n\nFor those of you who've been in a similar spot, where did you actually find your salespeople? Did commission only work for you, or did you just bite the bullet and keep paying salaries until someone stuck? Also open to hearing if my comp structure is off, always willing to adjust.\n\nAppreciate any insight. This is the one piece of the puzzle I haven't figured out yet.",

          "body": "We're a similar size dev shop and went through the exact same cycle. Hired two salespeople over a year and a half, neither closed a single deal. The problem is that selling custom software is fundamentally different from selling a product. Your prospects need someone who can talk architecture, understand scope, and build trust around technical competence. A traditional salesperson can't do that.\n\nWhat worked for us was treating sales as a partnership function, not a hire. We found two channel partners (an agency and a consulting firm) who already had relationships with the types of clients we serve. They bring us into conversations when a client needs custom dev work, and we give them a referral cut. No salary risk, no ramp-up time, and the leads come pre-qualified because the partner already has trust.\n\nYour commission structure looks reasonable, but I'd add one thing: make sure whoever you bring on has genuine technical literacy. They don't need to code, but they need to understand enough to have a credible conversation about what you build and why it matters. That's the filter most dev shops miss.",

Off the back of the workshop the client receives detailed documents of what they want to build. It’s a recommended architecture, feature and design doc. They see what they get in their MVP and their roadmap. You would essentially do a version of this when they sign up anyway but by doing it as a separate product there’s a low cost and low friction step that provides real value. Technically they can shop the doc to get quotes on the build but no one ever did because the relationship is built and they’re already in motion (especially now days when you have a tool like Figma make that can punch out a prototype in a few minutes and include mock UIs in the workshop doc 🤯). For sales people their close rate went up exponentially because they weren’t selling $100k build which will normally need several people to sign off on instead they were selling a $5-$10k workshop which usually only needs one person to sign off on.

          "body": "The reason you keep losing money on salaried salespeople is that government/enterprise software sales has a long cycle and a very specific skillset. Most salespeople who apply to small shops are used to selling something with a shorter close and an established brand behind them. They flounder when they have to open doors from scratch in a niche like SDVOSB contracting.\n\n  \nYour commission structure is actually solid for someone who understands the space. The problem is where you are looking. A few things that have worked for other small shops in similar positions:\n\n  \n1. Look for retired or semi-retired government contracting officers or program managers. These people have the rolodex and understand procurement, but they are done with full-time work. Commission-only or part-time with commission is perfect for them. Try AFCEA chapter events, local GovCon meetups, and LinkedIn groups specifically for SDVOSB/8a contractors.\n\n  \n2. Partner with other small SDVOSB shops that do complementary work (cybersecurity, cloud infra, data analytics). You refer them your overflow, they refer you theirs. No salesperson needed for those deals, just relationship management.\n\n  \n3. If you want a dedicated seller, consider a hybrid: small base (even $2-3K/month) plus your commission structure. The base signals that you are serious and filters out the dreamers. The good ones will earn way more from commission anyway. $2-3K/month is cheap insurance against another wasted hire.\n\n  \n4. Your $100K average deal with $350K LTV is a strong story. Lead with that when recruiting. A salesperson closing even 3 deals a year at your structure would earn $30K+ in commissions plus recurring. Make sure your pitch to salespeople is as polished as your pitch to clients.\n\n  \nThe uncomfortable truth is that pure commission-only is a red flag for top sales talent because they have options. The people willing to work 100% commission with no base tend to be either very confident or very desperate, and the ratio skews toward the latter.",

The good ones already have established books of business and are not browsing job boards.\n\nWhat has worked for similar shops I know: instead of hiring salespeople, they turned their existing team into a sales channel. Engineers writing about their work, speaking at conferences, being active in communities where government procurement people and CTOs hang out. Slower but the close rate is dramatically higher because the buyer is talking to the person who will actually build their system.\n\nThe SDVOSB advantage is also worth leaning into harder. There are procurement officers who actively need to fill set-aside quotas. Building direct relationships with those specific people is often more productive than any cold outreach campaign.",

Customers like \"experts\" far better than a vaporwave person.  How to do this easily?  Take one of your staffers along with you on a sales call.  Let them see how it works.  Then have them answer some of the customer's questions, and let the staff member \"snow\" the customer with technical jargon, as that is GOOD thing.  The staff member just PROVED to the customer they are technical, not good at talking with normal people, and literally will have a valuable opinion of the do-ability of the task, and even define the stages and algorithms needed to solve the task. \n\nThus,  the customer now knows your firm has experts who are well qualified to COMPLETE the job, instead of getting just half way, taking half the budget, before telling the customer, the job can not be done.\n\nHope this helps.",

We burned money on sales and marketing employees. We burned money on agencies. We burned money on paid ads. Tried everything to make that type of business scale.\n\nHere's the truth:\nYou are trying to solve an equation that has no solution. Look at all the answers here. Everybody is desperately trying to get a steady stream of customers running. \n\nFrom what I have seen and learned in the past 10 years, I would say it's not possible to come up with any sales or marketing strategy or tactics that generate new customers. \nSure, having a good partner company can work. But it will make you dependant and often, you will be the sub contractor in the back.\n\nHere's what does work. It worked for us and I know plenty of companies where it worked too:\n\nYou need to fix your OFFER. \nYou can't just offer sw development as a service. Nobody cares, really. It provides questionable results, it is risky, it takes forever, it is never the primary solution for any given problem but often the most expensive one and if you fail, it can seriously damage the decision makers career. \n\n\"But I want to offer custom dev\"\nYes. It is absolutely possible to do so.\nBut you need to separate FULFILMENT from your VALUE PROPOSITION.\n\nSee, your customers will buy the following offer:\n\"We help (industry) to achieve (transformation) in (time span), as proven by (case study A, case study B).\"\n\nE.g. \"We help medical device manufacturers cut time to market by 30% by introducing a custom PLM solution based on ... as end-to-end backbone in 3-6 months\"\n\nThat's an actual example of a biz doing very well. \nIt is still 80% custom development in the background. But the value proposition and the target audience is crystal clear.\n\nAnd abacadabra, sales and marketing suddenly do work.\nAnd it gets even easier to find new customers using partners and referrals. \n\nHow to shift from generic dev shop to such a business? I figured this out the hard way and I could write books about it. If people are interested, I can write some more information about it in another post.",

Here are the ones that we mostly use today:\n\n* Windsurf Cascade/Cursor: Our engineering team mostly uses Winsurfs's cascade agent running on top of Claude Opus for almost everything! I think most of our engineers now claim they haven't really written a line of code manually in the last 3 months! They have kinda turned into product managers who guide the AI agent over actually programmers! Has resulted in our engineering output doubling easily!\n* Sierra: We have been using Sierra (I think Intercom fin is an alternative) which has helped reduce our support ticket load by about 30% but auto resolving questions that doesn't need a human intervention. For example, questions about things that are already documented on our website, already answered previously etc! It can also basically connect with CRMs, Stripe etc to pull up details for them automatically!\n* Frizerly: Their AI agent can learn all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog on our website every day! We usually let is publish as a draft and manually switch it to published after a quick review! \n* Otter: We have been using Otters Ai agent to automatically transcribe, summarize create action items, update CRMs etc after every customer and internal call. Basically this has allowed us to build a single repository of all customer conversations in Notion automatically as well! This was a huge pain point for our sales team earlier\n* Clay: We have taught Clay our ideal customer personal using previous conversions. Now it can automatically reach out on both email and LinkedIn to schedule our first sales calls for our sales team. Saves a lot of time for everyone. Conversion rate for the automation is same as manual outreach at this point. \n\nCurious what others are using :)",

Replit in order to make mini tools and one-off builds for enterprise clients so we can deliver on some of the customer development that they need.\n6. Things like Cursor and Codex for any of our building just to make us a lot more efficient there.\n\nI think those are probably the top ones we use to make ourselves more productive.

Survived every framework war, every paradigm shift, every \"X is dead\" prediction.\n\nBut this one feels different.\n\nI spent my entire career getting good at something that's being commoditized in real time. The thing that used to take me weeks - someone with zero experience and an AI tool can ship a version of it in a weekend. Not a great version, but good enough to get users. Good enough to compete.\n\nAnd here's the timing irony: after two decades of building other people's products, I finally decided to go out on my own. Build something for myself. Be the founder, not the contractor.\n\nExcept now I'm launching into a market where the barrier to entry basically disappeared overnight. Every niche I research already has 15 AI-generated competitors. Every idea I validate has someone who shipped it last week using cursor and a vibe. The moat I spent 22 years building - deep technical expertise - is getting shallower by the month.\n\nThe fear is real. Not \"oh no AI will take my job\" fear. More like \"I waited too long and the game changed while I was warming up\" fear.\n\nWhat I'm learning (slowly) is that the 22 years aren't worthless - they're just worth something different now. Knowing what NOT to build is more valuable than being able to build anything. Understanding why systems fail matters more when everyone can make them work on demo day. And the experience of shipping real products to real users with real money on the line... that doesn't come from a weekend hackathon.\n\nBut I'd be lying if I said the doubt doesn't hit at 2am.\n\nAnyone else making the jump from senior dev to founder in this weird era?

It commoditized the lowest-value layer of my skills. The typing-code-into-editor part. The part I was never really selling anyway. What I was selling was judgment, architectural thinking, and scar tissue from production failures.\n\nSo now I use AI to move 10x faster on the commodity layer, and I compete on the layer the weekend builders don’t even know exists yet.\n\nBut I’d rather be a 15-year veteran with AI tools than a beginner with the same AI tools.\n\nYou’re not late.

Making business is another craft. It’s not enough to be able to build, but you need to build what people need and know how to find those people and how to sell it to them. It’s not goong to happen just because you build something useful and well-crafted.\n\nI see this as an opportunity. AI will never build what people want and need, and will never sell it. It’s people that will do that. You just need to focus on the business aspect, even more than on building.

      "selftext": "Three of us started this company 18 months ago. Me, my buddy from college, and his wife. We run a social media content agency for DTC brands. Split equity equally because we all brought different skills. She handles creative direction and client communication. He does strategy and ops. I manage finances and new business.\n\nHit $18K/month last quarter. We have six retainer clients. The work is good and the timing feels right. Brands are desperate for consistent content and we deliver.\n\nExcept when we don't.\n\nAbout two months ago I started noticing something. When they have small arguments work just slows down. She'll be short in client calls or take longer to turn around revisions. Annoying but manageable.\n\nBut when they have a real fight she vanishes. No Slack response. Misses client meetings. Phone goes straight to voicemail. First time it happened I thought maybe she was sick. Covered a client presentation myself. She came back three days later like nothing happened.\n\nIt's happened four times now. Last one was six days. We had a major deliverable due for our biggest client and she just went dark. I ended up hiring a freelancer off Upwork at the last minute and staying up until 4am to art direct because I don't have her eye for this stuff. Client never knew but we barely made it.\n\nHe won't talk about it. Last time I brought it up he said she just needs to process things her own way and then changed the subject. I've tried asking if we should bring on someone to help with her workload and he gets defensive. Says I'm overreacting.\n\nI'm not overreacting. I'm watching my income depend on whether two people are getting along that week.\n\nWe're profitable and actually have a waitlist. The market is good right now. I don't want to walk away from something that's working.\n\nBut I can't keep doing this either. I've tried building backup systems. Looked at content generation tools like Midjourney, APOB, bunch of others. Doesn't work because clients hire us for a specific aesthetic. I've tried keeping freelancers on standby but that gets expensive and they don't know our clients like she does.\n\nEvery time my phone is quiet for more than a few hours I get this knot in my stomach. Is she just busy or is this another one? Should I cancel my plans this weekend just in case?\n\nTwo weeks ago I was sitting in my car after a client call and drafted a message about buyout options. Sat there staring at it for like twenty minutes. Deleted it. What if I'm bailing right before they figure it out? What if I'm the guy who gave up on something good because of a few rough months?\n\nBut also what if it gets worse and she disappears during something we actually can't recover from?\n\nSome days I think the revenue is worth it. Other days I just want out. And I have zero say in which version of them shows up to work.\n\nHas anyone stayed in a partnership that was making money but felt completely unstable?",

You can bring up specific times when she went dark and you had to scramble to finish your deliverables, and ask if she needs support to make sure things don't fall off her radar. Alternatively, next time she drops the ball let her husband figure it out. As the finance and new biz guy you should not be responsible for communicating about BAU tasks with existing clients or covering for her. \n\nIf none of the above works, I'd think about exiting and looking for new cofounders that you can work with.",

If you already have one, check if it covers any of this.\n\n  \n2. Frame the conversation around protecting the business, not blaming her. Something like \"we are growing, we have a waitlist, and we need a plan for when any one of us is unavailable for any reason.\" Make it about all three of you, not just her.\n\n  \n3. Propose a backup creative person on retainer now, while things are calm. Position it as scaling up to handle the waitlist, not as replacing her. If she pushes back on that, that tells you something important.\n\n  \n4. Stop deleting those buyout messages. Save them as drafts. Talk to a lawyer about what a structured buyout or equity restructure would look like so you have real numbers instead of anxiety spirals in your car.\n\n  \nThe fact that you are profitable with a waitlist means you have leverage right now.

I run my own business and even though I have the freedom to take a day off whenever I want, I still feel guilty doing it.\n\nThe weird part is when I was working corporate I never felt guilty taking a day off. But now that I'm building something of my own every day I'm not working feels like I'm falling behind or wasting an opportunity. It's like the pressure is worse when it's your own thing.\n\nWhat's helped me a bit is realizing that burnout makes you less productive for weeks, but a day off just costs you one day. The math actually makes sense to rest. But yeah I still feel restless when I do it. I'll take a day off and spend half of it thinking about work instead of actually recharging which defeats the purpose.\n\nI don't think the guilt ever fully goes away honestly. I just try to remind myself that this is a long game and burning out isn't an option. Easier said than done though.",

They're completely different things. Building a company is a marathon. Nobody trains for a marathon by running every single day until their knees give out. You train smart, you rest on purpose, and you show up fresh when it counts. The guilt comes from thinking rest is the opposite of work, but it's actually part of the work.\n\nHere's what actually shifted things for me: I stopped treating rest as \"not working\" and started treating it as a responsibility. Your business needs you thinking clearly, not running on fumes making bad calls. I've made some of my worst decisions (wrong product decisions, misread documents) during stretches where I was \"grinding\" on 5 hours of sleep and zero downtime. Those mistakes cost way more than a Tuesday off ever would.\n\nThe guilt probably won't disappear entirely. But you can get to a point where you feel it and take the day anyway, because you know the version of you that comes back rested is worth more than the version that pushed through.",

Here's what finally helped me reframe it:\n\nYour business needs you to make good decisions more than it needs you to be constantly busy. And good decision-making requires a brain that isn't fried. When you're burned out, you're not actually being productive - you're just present. There's a huge difference.\n\nI started treating rest days like business investments. Would I skip maintaining equipment because I'm too busy using it? No, because it would break. Your brain is your primary business tool.\n\nWhat worked for me:\n\n1. Schedule days off in advance, not when you're already exhausted. Put them on the calendar like client meetings. It's easier to take a day off when it's planned than when you wake up and decide that day.\n\n2. Define what a good rest day looks like FOR YOU. For me, it's not lying on the couch feeling guilty. It's doing something active that's not work - hiking, reading, building something with my hands. The physical activity actually helps more than passive rest.\n\n3. Track your output before and after rest days. I noticed my best work weeks almost always came after I took a real day off. The quality of thinking was just better.\n\n4. Remember that your competitors burning themselves out isn't an advantage for them - it's a vulnerability.

If it breaks while you’re gone, you just found a bug you need to fix.\n\nStop viewing rest as laziness and start viewing it as necessary maintenance for the Founder.

Same angle. Same cursor hovering over revenue. Same refresh button. Same captions about quitting your job.\n\nOne in particular kept popping up on my feed. Young guy, rented Airbnb background, MacBook on the table, showing what looked like steady five-figure days. I wasn’t even mad about it. I’ve been in dropshipping long enough to know big days happen.\n\nI probably wouldn’t have thought twice about it if I hadn’t paused the video at the wrong time.\n\nWhen he refreshed the dashboard, the numbers updated and for a split second there were two dollar signs in front of the revenue. Most likely a typo. One slightly offset. It disappeared almost immediately when the animation finished. You wouldn’t notice it unless you scrubbed through the video frame by frame.\n\nSo I did.\n\nI replayed it a few times and it kept happening. The extra symbol showed up for a fraction of a second and then corrected itself. It didn’t look like lag.\n\nInstead of commenting publicly, I DMed him. Acted interested. Asked about the course, the usual questions. He replied quickly, sent voice notes, told me spots were filling up, as every guru does i guess.\n\nAfter a few messages, I sent him a screenshot from his own reel with the duplicate dollar sign circled and just asked what that was.\n\nHe responded saying they had a collaboration with a platform that lets them simulate dashboards for marketing. Said it helps make content cleaner and even sent a signup link to the same platform he was FAKING it all on. Said the real business is separate from what’s shown in videos.\n\nJust so you understand the size of this problem - there's probs way more affiliates, way more gurus who are selling you courses that don't even know how to do the thing they're selling.\n\nI know how bad it sometimes feels when your sales are slow and then you see a 19 year old kid flexing lambos and multi-million revenue on Instagram. I'm asking you to stop believing it.\n\nNow whenever I see those “flexing” videos, I can't help myself but to analyse every single detail of the video lol.\n\nEDIT: My DM's are being flooded by people asking what the tool name is. I do not condone this and for those who are asking in regards to \"research purposes\" the tool is is dashmock or mockdash, I can't quite recall due to archiving the conversation with the influencer and I am not affiliated with it in any shape or form.",

After **35 years in business and 15 years mentoring of founders**, I’ve seen that 'faking it until you make it' has mutated into 'faking it to sell how to fake it.'\n\nIn my book, **'Startup Inferno'**, I call this the **Circle of Lust for Round Zero**. It’s the obsession with looking successful to trigger other people's FOMO, rather than building a business that actually generates cash. When a guru tells you that 'simulating dashboards helps make content cleaner,' they are admitting that their business isn't sales, it’s illusion.\n\nUsing my **Curling analogy**: these guys are trying to convince you that they’ve thrown a perfect stone by photoshop-ing the target. But in the real world, the ice is cold and the friction is real. If you don't have a **Structure** that handles real customer data, real logistics, and real margins, you don't have a startup; you have a video edit.\n\nReal entrepreneurs don't flaunt dashboards; they obsess over **Operational Validation**. They know that the only 'clean' content is a bank statement that matches the tax returns.\n\n**Quick question:** Beyond the technical glitches, what do you think is the biggest 'red flag' in the way these gurus talk about the actual operations of the business?",

Always plan for and pay the required taxes.\n* Operations and Systems: This is how the daily work gets done and good processes and operations can be the difference between unpredictable problems and out of your control.\n   * SOPs are the documented steps to do any business.\n   * Supply chain is the raw materials or tools needed.\n   * Quality control is critical as poor products or services will mean unhappy customers, bad reviews, and the business failing.\n* Marketing and Sales: How the business will become known and gain customers.\n   * Marketing is building awareness of the business.\n   * Sales is the process of converting someone interested into a paying customer.\n   * Customer retention is the methods by which you keep customers for repeat business.\n* Legal and Compliance: Boring but essential as this ensures you and the business are protected and following the law.\n   * Structure might be an LLC or Corp or other which depends on how you are taxed and the level of personal liability you have.\n   * Licenses and permits required to operate the business in good standing.\n   * Contracts and warranties that are clear written agreements with customer, partners, employees and vendors. \n\nUnderstand each of these as you build a business plan around them to be prepared to start whatever business you decide on.\n\nNote that these are scalable as they all apply to the smallest of businesses through the largest.",

Ask the AI for a feasibility study, and an overview of the size of the market. \n\nIf it sounds financially feasible to build a prototype (probably several thousand), draw a crappy sketch on a piece of paper, and when you’re happy with it, find a 3D modeling person on UpWork on the cheaper side. \n\nSend the completed model out to whatever local vendors Grok can find given whatever the materials are, and pull the trigger if they agree to provide a prototype only. Do not send it to China. Make sure that you understand the cost for a batch from that vendor if the prototype sells. Plug that number back into the projection to determine the price you should charge for the item. \n\nThe prototype is what you take pictures of and put on a Shopify website to gauge demand. Worst case, you have a cool thing you wanted. Best case, many other people on earth also want that thing.\n\nI also strongly agree with the other post about creating an audience around the type of things you might build. A following is a massive benefit for showcasing a product. If you don’t want to create your own online content, you can always send your thing to influencers in that space for free for a review.

The first step usually isn’t “come up with a business”, it’s learning how to notice problems and how people already solve them day to day.\n\nMost businesses start from one of three places: something you keep seeing go wrong, something people complain about a lot, or something that feels unnecessarily complicated. Paying attention to those things is more useful early on than trying to force an idea.\n\nDay to day, business is a lot less glamorous than it sounds. It’s mostly understanding a problem clearly, trying a simple way to help, seeing what doesn’t work, and adjusting. The journey usually starts with observation, not inspiration.",

If you are not comfortable with that yet, get a sales job or do freelance work for a bit. That skill alone will carry you further than any business course.\n\n  \nAlso skip the LLC, the logo, the website, and the business plan until you have paying customers.

Learn sales, basic digital marketing, or how to build something (code, design, or a physical trade).

Those aren't just complaints; they are market gaps.\n3. **The 'Day-to-Day' Reality:** business isn't about vision boards. It’s about 80% admin, customer service, and solving small problems, and 20% growth. Start a 'micro-business' this weekend, sell a service on a freelance platform or flip an item. The goal isn't profit; it's learning how a transaction actually works.\n\nDon't wait for a grand vision. Find a small problem, solve it for one person, and charge for it.

Optimism becomes realistic and resilient.\n\n**Most startups don’t fail because of the idea. They fail because founders quit before reaching informed optimism.**",

To me, it relates to the self leadership. How can you define yourself outside of the frame and how you build and support your own context.\n\nAnother crucial point about your solution: pivoting if you discover that your business model is not viable. I am always surprised by how painful letting go an idea is.\n\nI am in my second mastermind group and it taught me a lot.  Discovering that we are all going through the same processes.

You do not need capital for that, just skill and relentless outreach.\n\nEveryone wants leverage before they’ve earned it. Leverage comes after you can consistently sell. So step one would be learn how to sell. Cold outreach, follow ups, handling objections, closing on Zoom. It’s uncomfortable but that’s where the money is. You can make 3k to 5k per month way faster with a service than trying to build the next big SaaS from zero. I’ve seen people burn 12 months building something nobody asked for. Painful.\n\nThen once cash flow is stable, I’d build distribution. Newsletter, Twitter, maybe YouTube. Not for ego, but to own attention. Attention compounds. You post consistently for a year and suddenly doors open. Weird how that works. It’s boring at first. Feels like shouting into the void. But that’s the tax.\n\nSo yeah. Service for cash.

The advantage isn't \"build an AI startup.\" The advantage is that AI lets one person do the work of three. A freelance copywriter using AI well can take on 3x the volume.

That's the actual leverage, using AI to amplify a service business, not trying to compete in the AI product space with zero runway.\n\n  \nBiggest mistake I see people make is skipping straight to \"build a SaaS\" when they have no income, no network, and no understanding of what people actually pay for.

Ask upfront: \"Is there an internal team involved in this project?\" Not confrontational, just standard discovery. Their answer (or dodge) tells you a lot.\n\n  \n2. Replace free demos with paid discovery. Even a small paid phase ($500-1500 depending on scope) filters out everyone who is not serious. Real buyers are happy to pay for it because they get value either way. Time-wasters disappear instantly.\n\n  \n3. If they push back on paid discovery, offer a short presentation or walkthrough of similar past work instead. Never custom-build anything before money changes hands.\n\n  \n4. \"Show us what you can do\" without any commitment from their side = free consulting. A legit client will have a budget, a timeline, and a decision-maker on the call. If any of those three are missing, be cautious.\n\n  \n5. Set a personal rule: no more than 2-3 hours of unpaid work before any engagement. That is enough for a proposal and a rough wireframe, not a full week of building.\n\n  \nThe silver lining is that once you start charging for discovery, the quality of your leads goes way up. The people who stay in the conversation after hearing \"paid discovery\" are almost always the ones who actually close.",

          "body": "So you went to an event to sell something, and are annoyed that everyone else was doing the same thing?\n\nEdit: to add to this, I normally find that networking events are better for finding people that are working *with* potential clients than finding potential clients. \n\nThink about an ideal client. What types of products or services are they likely to be using? Now, look for the people that sell that. Get to know them and their business and find out what other events they go to. The idea is to leave an impression and keep yourself fresh in their mind. These are people that will refer you when given the opportunity, and if you like them/their product or service, you now have someone to refer your client to in the event that you have that opportunity. \n\nFor example, we do managed IT for SMBs. I've found that  CPAs, fractional CFO/CIOs, business consultants, and Insurance agents that write a lot of Cyber policies are great referral partners for us. When I go to networking events, these are the people that I try to talk to the most. I never try to force the conversation, but when they inevitably ask, I have tailored verbiage and explanations based on what they do to help them easily identify the types of leads I'm looking for. \n\nNetworking is a marathon, not a sprint.",

One rep in particular was crushing it, consistently hitting 150% of quota, closing deals the rest of the team couldn't. When we decided we needed a sales manager, promoting him felt obvious. He knew our product, clients really loved him, and the team respected him.\n\nThree months in and everything was falling apart. The other reps were frustrated because he couldn't explain what he did differently; he just \"knew\" when a deal would close. Pipeline reviews were useless, he'd say things like \"this one feels good\" instead of actually coaching them. Two people from our team quit because they said they weren't learning anything. The worst part was that he was miserable, too. He missed selling and hated the administrative stuff.\n\nWe ended up moving him back to sales and hiring an actual sales leader from outside. Someone who'd built processes before, knew how to train people, and could look at data and spot patterns. It costed us about six months of momentum and probably $100K in lost deals while everyone was confused about who was running what.\n\nThe lesson for me was that your best performer is rarely your best manager. Those are completely two different skill sets. I wish I'd just hired someone with management experience from the start instead of assuming \"good at sales\" meant \"good at leading sales.\" Live and learn, I guess.\n\nHas anyone else made this mistake, or just us?",

See if they actually enjoy the administrative side and coaching parts. If they start getting antsy to \"just close some deals\" during that time, you have your answer.\n\nGlad you got him back into sales where he's clearly thriving.

Apparently he was phenomenal at sales and was one of the top earners for the company, so they moved him to a bigger market and put a team of people under him.\n\nThat's when he discovered that while he was a great salesman, he sucked at managing people. Apparently telling them to just do what he did doesn't actually work if you don't have Chris Pratt levels of charisma. He was hiring people with no experience off craigslist which is how he got the job but unsurprisingly, it went terribly.\n\nHe couldn't motivate them, he couldn't teach them, and because he was working with them so much his sales suffered.\n\nWhenever I see him in interviews now though I keep in mind, that's not him, that's his finely honed sales persona that he's turning on for the camera.

I've seen this exact pattern play out multiple times.\n\nThe mistake most founders make with first-time promotions is promoting based on current performance rather than leadership capability aka their CHARACTER. Just because someone is great at their job doesn't mean they can lead others\n\nHere's what works:\n\n1. Trial period - Give them a 30-60 day \"team lead\" trial before making it official. See if they can actually coach/train and motivate\n\n2. Set clear expectations and goals - Most new managers fail because they don't know what \"success\" looks like so always define it upfront. In your case it isn't just about sales numbers, but creating a team that is motivated and committed to your company's goal\n\n3. Weekly check-ins - Don't promote and disappear. Meet weekly to coach them through the transition, and run through role play scenarios. I do this all the time with leaders in my company and it always is way more helpful than you'd think. If I wanted one of my managers to train the sales team a certain way, the manager and I wouldn't leave the room until they could deliver that training exactly how I wanted it, with me playing the trainee\n\nThe hard truth: Some people are A+ individual contributors and C- managers. That's okay. Not everyone should be promoted, but with the right guidance you can grow that person into a leader\n\nWhat would you do differently next time?",

      "selftext": "I opened my dermatology practice 18 months ago. Things are going well, too well, actually. I went from 12 patients a day to 28 in a year and a half. The problem is my overhead has scaled way faster than my revenue. I started with one front desk person and one MA. I’ve now added a second MA and a billing coordinator, and I still need more help. My monthly payroll went from $8K to $22K, and when you add benefits, payroll taxes, and workers’ comp, I’m spending close to $30K/month on staff for a practice that’s netting $35K.\n\nThe bottleneck right now is admin. My front desk person is juggling phones, patient intake, appointment scheduling, referral coordination, and prior authorizations for procedures. She’s great but she’s one person doing a three-person job, and things are slipping: missed prior auths that delay procedures, phone calls going to voicemail, patients waiting 15 minutes just to check in. I know it’s hurting the patient experience.\n\nI’ve been doing the math on hiring a second front desk person and it’s brutal, $38–$42K salary plus $8–10K in benefits and taxes. That’s another $50K annual commitment when I’m barely keeping margins healthy. A friend who owns an urgent care told me he uses remote medical assistants from overseas who are HIPAA-trained and cost around $9–10/hour with no benefits overhead. He says they handle his phones, scheduling, and insurance verifications.\n\nI’m skeptical but intrigued. For any small practice owners who’ve used virtual medical assistants to scale: how did you handle the transition? Did patients notice or care that the person answering the phone was remote? And how do you manage someone who isn’t physically in the office? I need to grow my team without destroying the margins that make this practice viable.",

Three PAs can see 3x the amount of patients as one Doctor can.\n\nMAs are also cheaper than Nurses and can do most of the things a Nurse can in a Derm office. It is rare for a Nurse to be in a Derm office, unless it is an NP who is seeing patients and billing.\n\nYou also need to increase your volume. 28 patients per day is a comfortable pace.

You might not want to see that many as it can detract from the quality of care, but shooting for 45 per day is probably a good place to be.\n\nLastly, having an experienced biller and prior auth person is worth their weight in gold.

          "body": "Yeah, you’re not alone. The espresso machine thing is basically a rite of passage. Every small business owner has some version of “the one piece of equipment that knows exactly when to die for maximum damage.”\n\nThe part that nobody warns you about is how much of the job is just… maintenance. Not the creative stuff, not the reason you started. Just keeping the machine running (literally and figuratively). Payroll, permits, suppliers changing prices, a key employee calling in sick on your busiest day. It compounds.\n\nThe paperwork thing is real too. You open a coffee shop because you love coffee and community, and then you spend half your time in spreadsheets tracking beans and milk margins.\n\nTwo things worth saying though. First, the fact that you’ve kept it going for a couple of years already puts you ahead of most. The majority of coffee shops don’t make it past 18 months. You’re past the survival phase even if it doesn’t feel like it.\n\nSecond, if the “should I just get an office job” thought is showing up a lot, it’s worth taking seriously. Not as a sign to quit, but as a signal that something in the operation needs to change. Usually it means you’re doing too much yourself. The owners who last are the ones who eventually find a way to stop being the person who has to handle every crisis personally. That might mean a strong second-in-command, or systems that reduce the daily firefighting, or just cutting the parts of the business that drain you the most for the least return.\n\nBut also, some days just suck and the espresso machine breaks and you’re allowed to be annoyed about it.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

You just have to be organized.. and to be honest, what does being a CEO mean I’ve never never considered myself one\n\nI almost consider my task more  a general manager. \n\nBut my primary function is sales and working with customers. In all honesty, the accounting, our book work aspect isn’t overwhelming and it’s pretty common for people in sales to actually deliver the product so that’s not necessarily weird.\n\n\nFor me what might be challenging is constantly motivating yourself. Of course, money as a motivator, but in the past, sometimes the more challenging aspects were being easily able to put off something until tomorrow(or the next day or whatever)\n\nI’ve always gotten everything I need to get taken care of taking care of any customers will never go without anything, but if it’s something I can put off in the past it was pretty easy\n\nSo I might take a Friday afternoon off, even though I have things to do because there’s nothing that’s that time sensitive… then you get busy all at once and get stressed out about having to get a small project done that you’ve had plenty of time to do in the past\n\nAnd when you work for somebody, you feel a little bit more pressure because regardless of what it needs to be done if your boss says, do it, you have to do it\n\nFor me when things are real busy at work I’m so much more efficient and I’ll get everything done but when things get slow as one for whatever reason, I can feel more comfortable putting something off\n\nAnd that’s not a good trait to have so I just become a little more organized and more disciplined",

      "selftext": "My construction business that I started last year is owes $40k by a client who has been promising to pay since June. I call him on a weekly basis and he barely answers, and always has an excuse as to why payment is being delayed.\n\nI know that he doesn’t intend to pay. I live in Alberta Canada and I have registered liens on the properties he owes me money for, but he doesn’t seem to care. I know I can start civil litigation / take them to small claims court but I’ve heard this process can take years and even if I get a judgement in your favour, it’s up to me how I can enforce it.\n\nI’m at such a loss for what to do because I have bills and invoices from my subcontractors that I’m late on because of this client too.\n\nAny advice?",

Just keep going and make sure to consult an attorney for anything you aren't clear on.  Keep the pressure on, do not let this person forget about you. Make them uncomfortable.\n\nHere's some other things you can do (obvious pros and cons to doing each of these):\n\n\\-Use social media to publicly shame them (if you're in a major metro this probably won't be that effective but in smaller towns it definitely will get folks talking).\n\n\\-Don't just call, confront them in person, knock on their door, ask them when you're gonna get paid and let them know this isn't the last time they'll see you. \n\n\\-If you have to get documents served to them, don't do it at their house, do it at their work or somewhere else public you know they'll be.\n\n  \nI know it isn't comforting at this point but this should also be a lesson, tighten up your payment terms, make them pay more up front or collect more often (oftentimes laws govern what you can or can't charge so follow them).\n\n  \nGood luck for real.\n\n",

          "body": "$40k is absolutely worth going to court over. In Alberta you can file in Provincial Court for claims up to $100k now (used to be $50k). The filing fee is small compared to what you're owed.\n\nFew things:\n\n1. Stop calling him weekly. You're just reminding him that you haven't taken action yet. Every week that passes without legal consequences tells him he can keep stalling.\n\n2. Send a formal demand letter via registered mail. Give him 14 days. State the amount, the lien references, and that you'll be filing a claim. Sometimes the letter alone gets people moving.\n\n3. If he doesn't respond, file the claim. You don't necessarily need a lawyer for Provincial Court, but with $40k on the line it might be worth a consultation at least.\n\n4. The liens are good. If he ever tries to sell or refinance those properties, he can't without clearing them. But liens don't put money in your pocket on their own.\n\n5. For future projects: progress billing with clear payment terms in the contract. Net 30 max. No more work starts until the previous invoice is paid. Painful lesson but you only learn it once.",

Small claims in Canada caps out way below $40k depending on province so you'd need civil court anyway... and yeah the \"winning but not collecting\" thing is legitimate because judgments don't automatically turn into money. \n\nYou'd still need to chase enforcement through wage garnishment or asset seizure which adds more legal costs on top of what you've already lost.\n\nHonestly at this point hire a collections agency that works on contingency or a lawyer who specializes in construction liens... they'll take a cut but something is better than nothing while you're bleeding cash to cover his unpaid invoices.",

Sometimes this is all it takes to make them choose to pay you over someone else and then they are somebody else's problem. \n\nI would have a hard time accepting a check though from someone who's already tried to not pay me. \nI would probably want a bank transfer or something like that. \nIf you do get the courts involved and it becomes a judgment against the person because they can't pay, you may get some sort of payment plan or you may get as much as you can get now and payments later or you may never get anything but at least you'll have a judgment against them which potentially could be collected on later.",

The majority of the time isn't actually doing the work you like to do, it's handling inventory, legal compliance, marketing, sales, and all the other stuff that needs to be done around the actual things your business does.\n\n2. To quote a comedian \"Do you think a crackhead wakes up and just says they're too tired to go get crack today? No! So don't let a crackhead out hustle you\". \n\n3. I argue this is the important one, shut up and listen to people and ask questions about them and their problems. Most people don't care too much about your half an hour sales pitch. Obviously tell them what you're offering but shut up and understand their problems and how you're uniquely qualified to address their problems. I've lost jobs by not taking a minute and understanding my client and I've won customers over by shutting up and listening.\n\nBonus insight: Don't get hung up on the sale you didn't close or customer whom didn't buy. Take a second and see what you could have done to be better and move on. You're gonna fail but you should be marketing enough that there's two more coming behind him to sell to and not everyone is your customer. \n\nHope this helps someone.",

If everything works out ill have the buyout payment recovered in 6 months and back to profitability by q3.\n\nVenting here. Business partner for the past 5 years has up and quit. Demanded an insane payout, which was denied due to valuation not supporting it. Have countered with an offer that is grounded a bit more in reality while taking into account the massive risk I will be taking on as a solo venture. He's been less than pleasant about the whole ordeal, and has decided to just stop participating in operations while the payout is negotiated. A bit overwhelmed at the moment, mostly the books, as it has been his task to manage over the years. During the valuation, I discovered drastically inflated inventory assets and cash holdings. Have crawled the books trying to get everything proper but it's so overwhelming. How do you solo acts do it? Very impressive for single owner businesses to work, especially at the ground floor. I imagine in a year when I have more systems set up to support me and the business, it won't feel so catastrophic, but man, at the moment it's very intimidating and exhausting to even keep my head above water. Will be scaling back the entire business ad essentially rebuilding it brick by brick, this time without ay fuzzy back end details. It looks like a lot of nights in the future will be pairing panic attacks with whiskey haha.",

It's probably easier for a solo-preneur to struggle on their own while building up than to be in your shoes where a partner pulls the rug out from under you when things are already moving.

I'm prone to hanging out with my boy, Beam, m'self, but I'd recommend taking up fishing or some other mindless and distracting activity. If you're going to burn time while needing to put fires out, it helps to be relatively clear headed, and in a lot of ways those mindless activities are perfect for solving problems without the inundation of trying to \"solve everything, right here, right now, all at once.\" And remember, if you slash all four tires, insurance will cover it; 3 tires, and it's an \"act of God\" that isn't covered.",

One thing I’ve seen help in moments like this is narrowing the focus to “what must be true this week” instead of trying to fix everything at once — cash visibility, inventory reality, and liabilities first, everything else later.\nI work closely with a few operators and service folks (finance, ops, payments, compliance), and if you ever want a second set of eyes on a specific backend issue or just need to sanity-check something, I’m happy to help where I can.

Passwords, processes, client contacts. If your partner has info you need, get it before things get worse.\n\n2. Talk to a lawyer before making big moves. Even a 30-min consultation can save you months of pain later.\n\n3. Assess if the business is viable solo. Sometimes the answer is no, and thats OK. Better to know early.\n\n4. Reach out to your clients directly. Transparency builds trust. Let them know whats happening (at a high level) and that youre committed.\n\nThe emotional part is real too. Losing a business partner feels like a breakup.

      "selftext": "What are you currently using for health insurance being a small business owner? My Gusto plan went up to $2600 for a family of 4 which is insane considering my wife and I rarely use the plan and we are both 35 years old. My Marketplace rates were pretty much same cost because I can't get any subsidies because of my income (and we aren't rich we net around $165k between both of us total) The worst bronze plans were still around $1800-$1900, anything decent on marketplace was just around my plan with my payroll company around $2500ish. What is everyone doing?",

The owner was able to work with an insurance broker that was able to establish a policy through a professional association group so other small businesses join together to have one policy for the association. Even though it was under one association, each small business was its own entity.\n It knocked down the premiums for the employer and the employees. I'm not sure if this is an option for you or not possible. Your insurance broker might be able to help you set something up.",

          "body": "&gt; maybe fewer damage claims or disputes.\n\nWhere have you heard this.  I have no insider knowledge but everything I've heard is the opposite and that is common sense IMO.   More touch points more liability.\n\nIn general to your question I would ask back, \"Do you?\"\n\nFirst is this something your guests even want or would use let alone expect.  If price is a major selling point they are not going to want to do it just for tip reasons. \n\nAlso consider the groups who wont use it and what percentage of the guests they make up.   People with nicer cars often won't use valet for obvious reasons.  Business travelers often won't because they don't want to waste time waiting for the car.  And people with rentals may not because of rental agreement rules or fears of damage.  etc etc\n\nSecond consider the costs.  You will need this 24/7 or at least a way for the people to get their cars.   Would having an extra one or two staff members working at all times hurt profit?  (And is that even the best use of extra staff?)   How about the the insurance costs?  Sure you could simply hire a company to provide these workers and the insurance but of course that will likely cost similar if not more vs direct hires.  \n\nThird consider the headaches vs peak check in vs check out.  Part of why business travelers wont use it.  As people are waiting for their cars to be moved/brought up.   Sure it is bad now but would it be better?   \n\nAnd now instead of them blaming some other guest they blame you directly.   \n\nSure it may avoid some idiot leaving their car up front while they take their bags up and spend 30 mins in their room before parking.   But will they actual use the valet or is that just a car making the valet service worse?  \n\nAnd if that is an issue there are other options to consider to combat it like signage and staff training.  \n\nIn the end IMO if a hotel doesn't already have valet they likely are not in the right market segment to add it.  People know at least subconsciously they are paying more to get more.  They are not expecting or wanting to pay for valet when they book a place that shouldn't.\n\nIDK how much more per night you would need to charge to cover valet but prices would go up and tipping means most will pay more even if it doesn't.   \n\nIf those people were willing to pay more for valet and etc why didn't they?   Really think about that.   Don't hunt down customers who wouldn't stay at your place unless where they wanted wasn't available.  And don't price yourself out of customers who would stay if the price was just a bit less.  \n\nYour competition is unlikely to be the 5 star hotel in town.   It is the other 2-3 star(?) places.  Price and location plus basic quality are what you are likely competing on.  Free breakfast might help you win but I doubt valet would.   It just isn't something people in that market are IMO normally looking for.",

Sounds okay until you factor in that I'm working every single day.\n\nThe problem isn't the hours. I knew it would be hard. The problem is the hours keep going up but revenue stays flat.\n\nThree months ago I was working maybe 50 hours a week. Now it's closer to 70. I'm not taking on more clients. I'm just spending more time on things that feel productive but probably aren't.\n\nI'm using all these tools to \"save time.\" Email automation, meal plan templates, Calendly, ChatGPT for writing responses, APOB for videos, probably 10 other things I'm forgetting. Every week I add another tool that's supposed to make things easier.\n\nBut I'm busier than ever. I spend half my day managing the tools. Checking if the automation worked. Fixing things that broke. Tweaking settings. It's like I'm running a tech stack instead of a coaching business.\n\nMy girlfriend asked me last week why I'm always on my laptop. I tried to explain I'm \"building systems\" but she just looked at me and said \"you're always busy but nothing ever changes.\"\n\nShe's right. My client count hasn't moved in two months. I had three people cancel last month. When I asked why, one of them said my messages \"feel like templates\" and she's paying for personal coaching. That one hurt because I've been trying to be more efficient with check-ins so I have time for other stuff.\n\nI think I'm using all these tools to avoid doing the actual hard work. The hard work is reaching out to people. Asking for referrals. Actually talking to potential clients instead of hoping my content brings them in. Sitting down with each client for real conversations instead of sending them a template.\n\nBut that stuff is uncomfortable and slow and I can't measure it. Tools feel like progress. I can see the metrics. I can tell myself I'm being smart and efficient.\n\nMeanwhile I'm working 70 hours a week to make $4500/month and I barely see my girlfriend anymore. Last Sunday she asked if I wanted to go hiking and I said I needed to make videos for the week. I didn't even go outside that day.\n\nI see other coaches who seem to work normal hours and make more than me. I asked one of them how he manages everything and he said \"I just talk to people.\" No automation. No content calendar. He just has conversations and asks for referrals.\n\nI don't know how to stop. Every time I think about turning off one of these systems I panic because what if that was the thing that was actually working?\n\nI'm trapped in this thing where I'm too busy to figure out if I'm doing the right things.\n\nDid I build myself into a corner?",

Talking to people, asking for referrals, having real conversations -- that stuff is scary because it involves potential rejection. Setting up an automation sequence feels productive and safe. But safe doesn't grow the business.\n\n\n\nThe guy who just talks to people and makes more than you? He's doing the one thing that actually generates revenue. Everything else is a support function.\n\n\n\nWhat worked for me when I was in this exact trap:\n\n\n\n\\- I did a \"tool audit.\" Listed every tool I pay for and every tool I spend time managing. Then I asked one question for each: \"Did this directly lead to a new client in the last 90 days?\" Most of them didn't. I cancelled about 60% of them.\n\n\n\n\\- I set a rule: no more than 30 minutes per day on \"systems.\" Everything else is client-facing work.\n\n\n\n\\- I went back to basics. Made a list of 10 people I could call that day and asked for referrals or just caught up. Within a week I had 2 new leads from conversations.\n\n\n\nYour girlfriend is right. You're always busy but nothing changes. The discomfort you feel when you think about stopping a system is the same discomfort that's keeping you from doing the work that actually matters.

And yeah, clients can feel templates instantly.

Each client pay enough so you dont need many, the ratio is up to you and your goals but value needs to match the price.\n\nThe other path is to have a system where more clients doesnt mean less time. Meaning if you had 100 clients, you would spend the same amount as 50. But this is not true coaching. This path you have some templates that match the clients goals, needs and wants. There 2 routes you can go here, either subscription based, one time buys. For subscription based you need a platform they like and \"depend\" on for their workout for example a platform with tracking, guides and logs. The one time buys, you have programs lasting 4-6 weeks for example for cutting or bulking. And a way to have them buying new products. So you add a new program for example every month. So if they liked the first one, they might try a new one after they are done. Or you can have different phases of programs like beginner, intermediate and advanced. Its basically up to you to make templates that covers everything you would want.\n\nI think you or the clients see your product as the first, but your trying to build the other types and its mixing which gives wrong signal to you and them. So it really depends on your goal and vision, just make it laser focused and make it clear what your aiming at instead of aiming it everywhere. Because it sounds like your hitting a little bit of everywhere and its barely making a dent",

It’s a software engineering thing, but the principle can be extrapolated into any sort of system design.

That's worth more than any automation dashboard.\n\nOne thing that helped me break out of a similar loop: I started tracking how I spent each hour for a week. Not categories like \"marketing\" or \"operations\" - actual activities. \"Debugging Zapier flow\" vs \"having a conversation with a prospect.\" When I saw how little time went to the stuff that actually moved the needle, it was a wake-up call.\n\nYou clearly know what works (conversations, referrals, personal touch).

Here's what I'd do if I were you: 1.\n\n**Track where money actually comes from.** Go through your 28 clients and write down how each one found you. Not where you think they came from, but actually ask them or check your records. I'm guessing most came from referrals or direct conversations, not your content calendar or automation stack.\n\n2. **Kill one system per week.** Start with whatever tool you spend the most time managing. Turn it off for 7 days and see if anyone notices or if revenue drops.\n\nMost of the time nothing happens except you get hours back. \n\n3. **Get clear on your actual numbers.** You're making $4500 but working 70 hours.\n\nThat's like $15/hour, which is brutal. But you also don't know where money is leaking or what clients are actually profitable. I came across AsteroCFO.Ai recently and it looks like it could work for this kind of situation.\n\nTheir AI CFO lets you upload your financials and ask questions in plain English for $397/mo, so you can actually see where you're bleeding time vs money without hiring someone full-time. \n\n4. **Block off 10 hours next week just for conversations.** Reach out to past clients who left on good terms.\n\nAsk current clients if they know anyone. Have coffee with that coach you mentioned. No tools, no automation, just talking to humans about their problems.\n\n5. **Raise your prices or change your model.** If someone canceled because your messages feel like templates, that's actually valuable feedback. Either go back to personal check-ins and charge more to make it sustainable, or own the templated approach and market it as structured programming at a lower price point.\n\nThe girlfriend hiking thing is the real signal here.

Yes, I could do online or incorporate technology or I could do private lessons in person but I choose the very traditional method of instructing a class. \nIt probably took a little bit more leg work to set up then you setting up your online coaching but like I said I'm old school. It takes very little of my time per week though. \n\nWhen reading you have 28 clients that doesn't sound like a lot but then when I think that this is a physical activity coaching kind of thing, you didn't say how many sessions a week you have with each person??\nI would assume at least one but likely to for many people so your average might be over two.\n\nAll of a sudden this becomes a pretty heavy workload because if you're having almost 60 sessions per month or more then that means you're having two per day and these things are probably at least 30 minutes or an hour. \nYou have to prep and have set up time etc and likely takes some time after you session too.\n\nI know too some people who have full-time jobs and put in at least eight hours a day they don't see this as being a lot but they also don't realize how much idle time occurs at most of those 8 hour per day jobs. \n\nSo I can certainly see this being a little hectic. \n\nScheduling would seem to be the key for this part in trying to get them back to back etc but I guess you're saying that it's not the actual on the clock work thing that's waiting you down but rather all the accessory operations. \n\n\nI agree with what you said about the lady telling you it seemed to automated because that's a big brush off today and even worse with AI coming on stronger. \nI'm all about the personal attention and building relationships.\n\nI think a lot of people in businesses try to do too much or want to do too much so they incorporate these outside things or software etc to help them. \n\nI guess my suggestion would be to sit down and think of an alternate business plan like you were setting this up from the beginning. \nStart making notes and writing everything down and see what the basic minimum things you really need to do are. \nThis should actually be easier now then if you would have done it before you started because now you should know some of the things that are definitely important to focus on and you should be able to take some of the things you're doing now and realize they're not that important nor are they benefiting you much. \n\nSo think about a massively streamlined approach. I would think there has to be several ways you can cut down the time you spend watching everything and tweaking everything which I bet a lot of it is just worrying that things aren't getting messed up. \n\nIt would be nice to feel more confident that you could walk away from everything for 5 or 6 hours and come back and not worry that will be messed up anything it was, it shouldn't be anything that you couldn't fix in 6 minutes. \n\nThe only thing I see that can cause conflict in relationships and also other employment when you have businesses like this is the fact that you're always on call to take phone calls. \n\nI have a fairly strict policy about not conducting business via text messaging and so many people have embraced text messaging completely and that's a real problem. \nThere's no rules or etiquette about text messaging like there haven't been with emails since their inception early on. \nPeople will often not call someone very earlier very late but they'll send a text or an email anytime!\nAnd in the service industry like this if you don't respond to their text in 5 minutes, they feel neglected. \n\nOf course needy clients and high maintenance ones we'll just call you way too frequently or at odd times if they don't have the text option. \n\nThis can be a tough one but most people don't need their hand held quite so much and most can get by with just the hand holding during their actual sessions.\n\nMy biggest concern would be maintaining my number of clients and if I got low putting some extra time into picking up some new ones but other than that I don't see what is so critical to watch all the time or put so much time into ...

          "body": "Because most business advice comes from people who’ve never had to get a stranger to trust them with no brand, no proof, and no referral.\n\nThe corporate playbook assumes you already have traffic, pipeline, brand recognition, and a sales team. Strip all that away and you’re left with the actual hard part — getting someone who has no reason to care about you to believe you can solve their problem.\n\nI’ve spent 15+ years working with small service businesses and I’ll tell you what actually works at that stage because it’s stupidly simple and nobody talks about it.\n\nGo find people who have the problem you solve and tell them what’s wrong. For free. No pitch. No “let me know if you need help.” Just show them something about their own situation that they didn’t see before.\n\nI literally got my first handful of clients by looking at local businesses and pointing out specific things that were costing them money. Not vague “your marketing could be better” stuff. Specific, concrete, “you’re losing customers here and here’s why” stuff. Half of them didn’t hire me. The other half couldn’t hire me fast enough because nobody had ever just told them the truth without trying to sell them something first.\n\nThat’s the part the LinkedIn crowd will never teach you. At the startup and small business level, the sale happens when someone realizes you see their problem more clearly than they do. Not when you pitch them a solution. Not when you close them with some framework. When they feel genuinely understood by someone who clearly knows what they’re looking at.\n\nThe advice isn’t sexy. Go find 10 businesses this week. Look at what they’re doing. Tell them what you see. Don’t ask for anything. Some of them will ask you what it would cost to fix it. That’s your first clients.\n\nEverything else — the funnels, the content strategy, the sales process — that’s all stuff you build after you’ve proven you can actually help someone. Not before.",

Because most of the people giving advice skipped the part you are in.\n\nThey are talking about optimizing pipelines and tightening close rates.\n\nYou are just trying to get someone to say yes.\n\nEarly stage problems are not “How do I increase conversion by 2 percent?”\n\nThey are:\n\nHow do I get my first 5 customers?\n\nHow do I talk to businesses when nobody knows who we are?\n\nHow do I not feel like I am faking it every time I pitch?\n\nThe reason it all sounds corporate is because it is optimization advice, not survival advice.\n\nHere is the simple version nobody says clearly.\n\nSales only happen in 4 ways:\n\nKnown. People who already know you.\n\nUnknown. Strangers you reach out to directly.\n\nOrganic. Content people find over time.\n\nPaid. Ads, affiliates, sponsorships.\n\nThat's it. All current, past and future conversations will fall into one of those buckets.\n\nMost startups try to jump straight to organic or paid because it feels scalable and legit. It's a tremendous waste of capital and time to try and validate your stuff by paying to show it to others.\n\nBut if you cannot sell one on one to:\n\nSomeone who already knows you\n\nOr a complete stranger\n\nThen ads will just amplify the fact that the offer or messaging is not dialed in yet.\n\nThe unsexy path actually works:\n\nFirst, go to your “known” network. Make a list of 20 people. Start conversations. Not hard pitches. Just real conversations. There should be somebody who's you either know or somebody who knows somebody else in your network who could utilize your solution typically.\n\nThen move to “unknown.” Pick one channel. Cold email, cold call, DMs, whatever. Talk to 5 strangers a day. You will suck at first. That is the point. Just execute, everybody wants some sort of magic bullet. They're looking for a Xanax pill that's going to just blow them up overnight when really what they need is physical therapy. You have to get really good at selling this thing. Two strangers before you can graduate to the next steps.\n\nOnce you can consistently sell one on one, then start making content based on the exact questions people keep asking you.\n\nThen, and only then, scale it with paid.\n\nYour friend is partially right about sales, it's the lifeblood of any business and the reality is that most businesses are shockingly bad at it.\n\nIt is because you are guessing which of the four lanes you are actually in.\n\nFor now you just need to stick with one thing and get really good at that channel.\n\n[I explain the whole breakdown here if you want it laid out clearly.](https://youtu.be/5EjzIA-Zyd8?si=zuPJs2PCpaC2-Exn)\n\nIt will probably save you a lot of wasted time and money",

None of what you have mentioned is a violation of any sort of landlord tenant agreement or practice.  If you see yourself staying there long term then I would definitely try to lock in long-term so he can't just add it back into your rent cost though. \n\nAlso in your lease there is likely a section called tenant improvements and betterments. That is to say that whenever you are done with your lease and the facility it no longer belongs to you anything that you've put into the actual facility itself. Anything that is bolted, glued, screwed down now belongs to the landlord. Keep that in mind because the landlord will be profiting off of your money with the next tenant that goes into the space by providing a better space.",

The other way to do it is have a certain construction budget built into the asking price and then negotiating how much to give based on desirability or credit worthiness of the tenant. Or refusing to do any TI at all.\n\nIt's a pretty common structure. It's what I use.  I include an interest rate as well and encourage my tenants to use cash or and sba loan if they don't like it.\n\nEvery expense the landlord has is rolled into rent. So is profit margin.  You as the tenants would be paying 100% of the cost no matter what.\n\nIf you leave early the landlord will want and have a legal claim for the unamortized cost of the improvements.\n\nIt's a stretch to assume these specific improvements increase the long term value of the space.  In ground grease traps and built kitchens tend to do that; not much else does.  \n\nYes the landlord gets cpi or rent increase percentage on the difference. He'd get this having higher base rent.\n\nYou could try and negotiate that the rent increase ends at the end of the amortized period or make a mental note to bring it up and ask for new stuff.\n\nWhen we do this sort of thing we have a hard bid from the contractor and any change order by the tenant they pay cash for.  In other words it's set scope, signed contract, fixed rent and fixed landlord contribution.\n\nPersonally I think the issue you have is why you would assume liability for the loan to build the improvements your cotenant needs for their business but you don't need for yours.  At the very least that should play into your discussions with her about what she pays vs. you.  You should be mindful that if she bails you still owe the rent and improvements payment.

It’s great for quickly generating emails and social content without losing your brand voice, so you spend less time stressing about what to send and more time running your business.",

Free up to 1,000 subscribers and the automation builder is dead simple. Set up a welcome sequence and follow-up reminders once, then forget about it.\n\nFor social posts, Buffer's free plan lets you schedule across platforms. Batch your content once a week, schedule it all, done.\n\nBut honestly the biggest win for me wasn't a specific tool. It was just picking ONE system and committing. The trap is trying 5 platforms, getting halfway set up on each, and ending up worse than before.\n\nIf I had to start over with zero budget: Google Calendar for reminders, Mailerlite for email, Buffer for social. That covers 80% of what you described. You can get fancier later once the basics are running.",

I had 4 months left and it was time to decide to renew, move or just close the business. Business had actually started to improve in the few months prior to this, but I'd had a shit 2 years, getting battered from every angle. I just couldn't face any more uncertainty.\n\nSo, I closed it, got a job that I'm at now. Enjoy it more, get paid a little more, work less  and I forget about work when I finish every day.\n\nMost important is I know that every hour I work I'm getting paid for that hour. I hadn't worked a regular job for 7 years, and when I started to get a regular payslip it was like a revelation to me. Just the knowledge that I knew how much I was getting paid every month.\n\nEven when my business was going well (and I was at one point earning a little more than I am now), I still hated that uncertainty. I sometimes delayed my pay until a month later if I had a lot of stock to pay for.\n\nI've started lurking on this sub though from time to time as I get a little nostalgic about the freedom to create that running a business gives. But then I'm reminded about the stress, the uncertainty, the sleepless nights over things that are, in the grand scheme of things, completely meaningless.  \nFor me, it just wasn't worth it. \n\nI work in a job that's much more satisfying that previous jobs, and that's the right balance for me",
