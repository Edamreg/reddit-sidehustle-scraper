      "selftext": "Stop asking “which side hustle should I start?” \n\nThat question is why most people never start.\n\nA better way to decide is to answer just 3 things:\n\n1. Do I want quick cash or long-term growth?\n\n2. Do I prefer learning or repeating simple tasks?\n\n3. How much time can I actually commit weekly?\n\nOnce you answer those honestly, 80% of side hustles automatically disappear.\n\nYou don’t need the best idea.\n\nYou need the right category for your current life.\n\nMost people fail because they choose a hustle that conflicts with their energy, not because the idea is bad.",

I've already tried doing these:\n\n* Faceless youtube (youtube is basically filled with those so being able to emerge between all the pile of similar channels it's almost impossible)\n* Surveys (it feels frustrating having to sell your persdonal data for less than a euro every time)\n* Content creation for brands (homefromcollege and similar bullshit, please)\n\nI'm searching something different from those experiences, and i'm not even searching for millions of dollars, probably around 200 euros per month would even satisfy me, i've studied as a graphic designer and i'm able to write short articles about different topics, if anyone of y'all has a suggestion, you are free to share it, thanks you all in advance. :-)",

Honestly anything thats reupholstery is lucrative, you work alone, if you screw up just redo it etc. Bit of a learning curve but you seem like a competent driven individual. Boats and such are huge. \n\nCraft kits - no parent in your local area wants to spend the time gathering supplies they just want to jump on Amazon and order, could make these with some nice instructions and sell locally on fbook, change up based on the seasons\n\nSaturday sewing classes - bring a piece of clothing, couple cold beverages and teach parents how to hem or alter clothing instead of doing it yourself haha",

          "body": "My job is market research. Reputable companies should compensate adequately for the time involved but often the survey ends up longer than it should be. Better money is in qualitative research - focus groups (live or online) or individual interviews (usually online). Because we expect you to spend 30-60 minutes or more, compensation can be $100-$200 and it's more fun. \n\nBut - getting those opportunities depends on passing the screener survey, which depending on the client/product category, asks about product use and things like whether you have kids or cats, etc. Ex, if you don't have a cat it's pointless for us to get you in a discussion about your experience with cat food. \n\nThe easiest way to get survey projects (qual or quant) is to:\n\n1. Be in the demographic most companies want to sell to - usually 28-45.\n\n2. Sign up to be on a panel and fill out their forms on demoraphics, product use, lines/dislikes. You'll get more targeted screeners. Lots of research companies have panels and you can be in as many as you like.\n\n3. Participate in one of those apps where you scan your receipts. Often, those are owned by companies like mine who use the data from the receipt uploads to provide real info on sales and demographics to manufacturers and retailers. Data is provided in aggregate and clients aren't allowed to contact panelists. The US now has very strict privacy laws and we have to abide by them or risk a lawsuit that could put us out of business. Our lawyers will only let us work with clients who sign our PII agreements.\n\nThe value of doing this is that if the marketing research company has your verified purchase info the screening isn't as annoying. It's not as much of a fishing expedition to find the right respondents, don't have to send a ton of surveys to people who don't qualify, so you don't waste their time. \n\nBottom line - this is legit but not in any way a regular thing, not even a part-time job. Most companies have rules about how often they will send surveys to the same people because it's not in their interest to burn panelists out or talk to the same 1000 people all the time. \n\n I'm about to retire and if I was a panelist I would not get many survey invites because of my demographic. Also, if you don't consume a lot of stuff, you won't get a lot of survey invites either. The point of market research is to understand how to sell stuff to people who like to buy stuff! \n\nNote - I have never worked in political opinion polling so I don't know how that works or what they pay.",

The issue is the tedium. You're gonna be putting in the same info dozens and dozens of times. You're gonna get really annoying questions you have to answer. The worst part is the declines. Some will decline you without even asking you anything and when they are repeated, it can be discouraging. It's all pretty mind numbing. To make matters worse, if you are like me and need stimulation to achieve any real accuracy, you may get banned simply from making some small error. Some survey providers are very picky.

      "selftext": "Roughly 12 months ago I traveled to Asia (Japan and China) for just over two weeks. I had an incredible time and an epiphany I wasn’t expecting. \n\nThis is the most time I have consecutively taken away from work, fully focused on fun and relaxing. I work in sales, six figure deals, grueling hours, but I find it for the most part fulfilling. \n\nWe flew from Japan to China to see my partners family, flight from Tokyo to Shanghai, and then a 3 hour drive. This left me with a ton of time to reflect on the trip so far and also the trip to come. I felt completely overwhelmed by the idea that I want to be able to do this more. I started thinking about ways to make passive income to pay for a trip like this again, but in reality money wasn’t as much of the issue as time was. \n\nI have a job that doesn’t allow me to work remote nor would it be a good idea for me to negotiate a hybrid or remote position at my current company. My job is reliant on being in front of the consumer. So I pivoted and started thinking about what I could possibly do at the same time as my day job, with minimal risk.\n\nAfter traveling in China and returning home with a huge inspiration to break out of my predictable life and really try something new I began brainstorming. I thought about all of the things that I saw in Asia that I didn’t see in the US.\n\nAfter a lot of time compiling ideas I remembered these charging kiosk that were everywhere in China. Scan a QR, portable charger pops out, plug your device in and carry on. We used these a few times when we needed a boost and it was so easy.\n\nInitially I began looking at sourcing a kiosk like I saw from a Chinese company, but that idea faded after confusing product descriptions and huge shipping costs. \n\nI know this exists to an extent in the US, I have seen versions of this product at malls, stadiums, and a few restaurants. Most of these required an individual sign up, leaving your phone at the kiosk, or no where to return it.\n\nI found a US company that created a product that I felt was closest to what I experienced in China. I scheduled a call with a rep to learn more and I was impressed. The rep answered a lot of questions and encouraged me to “act fast” as this was around the time that the tariffs were being introduced.\n\nI bought 10 kiosks that house 10 portable power banks available for rent. \n\nI live in New York City, a place I believe could hugely benefit from an integrated portable phone charging infrastructure. In my head this was like the “Citi bike” of phone charging. \n\nUpon receiving my 10 kiosks I started my outreach to businesses. Again, I currently work in sales so I assumed this was the easy part. I had a pipeline full of leads, I made an excel tracker to monitor my business and I was off to the races.\n\nI sent probably 500 emails and got one reply which I later found out was an AI assistant lmfao. I continued the email outreach but changed my template and introduced some A B testing. I added cold calls to the equation…\n\nIf you have never called a business in Manhattan and tried to pitch something, let me tell you… character building. Anyways I had no luck. So I also incorporated messaging on social media, which surprisingly got the most traction.\n\nHere is the question:\n\nMy rep told me that If I at any point wanted to return the chargers he would buy them back from me.\n\nSo after almost 12 months of trying to make this work should I call it quits? Or am I not trying hard enough?\n\nI certainly assumed this would be easier and that my sales background would make it almost a cake walk but I have been humbled.\n\nI have more ideas on gaining traction in the new year but at the same time I am so sick of failing. \n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

So I now have 2 co-founders (there around my age) and I've given them 20% each and made them in charge of the admin work - so there job is to find tutors and students throughout the year because I won't be able to do that once my school starts as I'm going into my final year. They've done the IB and they are tutors themselves which helps because right now they've been finding students (and we have some potential students) - does anyone know where to find students/tutors I told them to use Reddit/Facebook groups but let me know if you guys have any advice?\n\nNow what's my role. Since school is starting - throughout the year I'm committed to growing the businesses social media accounts - so I'm gonna be posting on Instagram/TikTok because hopefully by the time the school year ends I want like 50k followers. What type of content should I post though? Also as for the study guides/resources part we haven't sold any paid products although we've provided hundreds of free resources for students. Any advice?",

You could set up a simple automation to alert you when someone is looking to tutor or be tutored as well.\n\nAs for social media, there are tons of study accounts out there, @/showmeyournotes, @/malinstudies, and @/thatipadvibe being my favorites.

It was amazing to check on the earnings at the end of each month and realize that I made money doing almost nothing.\n\nOver the years bandwidth sharing apps have become more popular and there have been a lot of different apps launched. I have experimented with several of them and know how hard it is to find the bandwidth sharing apps that \"work\".\n\nSome are fake and will never payout. Others are dangerous and can infect your device. I have learned the hard way how to vet these services and now I launched a website to help people find the best bandwidth sharing apps.\n\n[ShareData.app](http://ShareData.app) is a directory of bandwidth sharing apps classified by reliability. I launched this app out of my dorm room with a few friends who are also passionate about passive income.\n\nEvery month we update the classification based on three criteria:\n\n1. Financial Return\n2. Payout Reliability &amp; App Consistency\n3. Safety, Security, &amp; Risk Mitigation\n\nThe goal is to help find the bandwidth sharing app that pay their users and do not harm your system or use your bandwidth to access any troublesome sites.\n\n**We do not accept any sponsorships nor do we use any advertisements.**\n\nNew bandwidth sharing apps cannot use our platform to advertise themselves and our ranking is based solely on the performance of the bandwidth sharing app.\n\nWe are hoping this community benefits from this directory and welcome any feedback you have about the website!",

      "selftext": "So I have a small YouTube channel about home organization and decluttering, been doing it since like March last year. Making around $400-500 from adsense depending on the month, plus maybe another $150-200 from affiliate stuff. Not huge but pays for groceries.\n\nLike I did a video about organizing under the sink and it got 80k views, that one probably made me $200. But most videos get like 5-10k views.\n\nProblem is I spend like 10-15 hours a week filming and editing and im kinda burned out. My wife keeps saying I should post the same content on tiktok and instagram. She sends me tiktoks of other organization accounts like \"see they're making money, you should do this.\" Shes probably right but I really dont want to film everything twice. Also my youtube videos are like 12-15 minutes and nobody watches that on tiktok.\n\nBeen trying to repurpose content for the past 2 months and its kinda working but also kinda a mess. My workflow is all over the place. Sometimes I use Descript to pull clips, sometimes I just do it manually in CapCut cause Descript crashes a lot. Sometimes I use those AI avatar things for videos where I dont want my face, tried a couple like APOB and HeyGen but not sure if people think its weird. Sometimes I just use stock footage with my voiceover.\n\nSo far after 2 months:\n\n* TikTok: posted maybe 30 videos, got around 2k followers somehow, made like $45 from affiliate links\n* Instagram: posted 25 reels, got maybe 700-800 followers, made $30\n* YouTube Shorts: posted 20, complete waste of time, best one got 400 views\n\nThe annoying part is I still dont know what actually works. Some of my avatar videos do ok on tiktok, some flop completely. My real face videos are hit or miss too. Algorithm makes no sense.\n\nAlso im spending like 5 hours a week just repurposing stuff which defeats the whole purpose of trying to save time. Like yesterday I spent 3 hours trying to export a video and CapCut kept freezing. Almost gave up.\n\nFunny thing is my wife started posting the same content on her own account just using her phone and shes already at 5k followers in like 6 weeks. Meanwhile im here spending hours with all these tools making $45 a month on tiktok. She keeps laughing at me.\n\nNot sure if I should keep doing this or just focus on YouTube and forget the other platforms. Anyone else deal with this?",

Your $400-500/mnth on YouTube suggests the audience is there but you're spreading thin instead of optimising that funnel. One thing that's worked well (and by extension, kept people sane) fix the workflow first, then expand. Those 10-15 hours could probably become 6-8 with better systems. Much easier than managing four platforms badly.",

Every time I watch a popular youtuber's channel I think about all the work it took to create that bit of content and I'm all like NOPE! Good luck OP! Watch your mental health.",

Microtasks are rarely worth the effort beyond pocket change. AI tools are powerful, but mostly as an accelerator, not a business by themselves.\n\nPersonally, I think digital products have the biggest long-term potential right now. You can build something once, improve it over time, and sell it repeatedly. No clients, no constant meetings, and it scales much better than hourly work. The key is keeping it simple and actually useful — guides, templates, systems, things that save people time or confusion.\n\nThere’s no magic shortcut, but combining real skills with digital products and a simple distribution strategy has been one of the most sustainable models I’ve seen.",

          "body": "Forget about the year. The fundamentals of making money haven't changed in a decade. Most of the noise you see about AI automation and microtasks is garbage designed to keep you poor. Real income is never passive when you start. It is active, painful work. If you want realistic results, you need to ignore the shiny objects.\n\nThe most reliable path is simpler than people admit. You need to sell a product that solves a painful problem. This can be software you promote as an affiliate or a simple digital guide you create. That is it. I wasted years jumping between dropshipping and crypto before realizing that boring businesses pay the best. You don't need a groundbreaking idea. You just need a boring system that works every day.\n\nPick one traffic source and master it. It will feel like you are screaming into the void for the first six months. That is the barrier to entry. Most people quit there. I built my entire income stream by focusing on email collection while everyone else was chasing viral dances. Build an audience, move them to an email list, and sell them something useful.\n\nDo not overcomplicate this. Focus on one thing until it works. The only reason people fail is that they get bored and switch lanes too early.",

This is exactly what kills this business.  People fall in these traps, then are faced with friction, get overwhelmed, frustrated to finally quit prematurely because they didn't make a single dollar the first month when they were expecting 10K$.  \n\nWith such a bad experience, experience that was started with the wrong expectations, it's not surprising why so many beginners a considering \"passive income\" (nothing is truly passive by the way) business models such as affiliate marketing, to be scam. \n\nIf true, well, these gurus don't tell you how many years they were trying online without any income, the skills they most have acquired to build performance, the effort done, the huge audience they have grown with time. 10K$ is usually the results of a 1 month campaign backed with years of experience.\n\nThose gurus have all the merit for the effort, but not for promoting easiness that make a beginner to believe everyone succeed except him.",

      "selftext": "I've been lurking on this sub for a few months now and it genuinely changed how I think about making money on the side. I started out looking for quick ways to make extra cash and ended up building something way more sustainable than I expected. Now I'm sitting at around $1000/month from mainly 2 streams, so I'll share what worked:\n\nThe Main Thing : Canva Creator Program ($600-800/month)  \nI've been uploading FB and IG ad templates to Canva since earlier this year and it's turned into legit royalty income. The cool thing is I don't need to keep uploading to maintain the cashflow, it just compounds over time. All those elements and templates you see in Canva are made by individual creators and we get paid a small percentage based on how much they're used by Pro subscribers. Since I started earlier this year I've been seeing consistent growth month over month.  \nMy process is super simple. I use Meta's Ad Library to see what's working in paid ads right now. You can filter by industry, see what formats are popular, and basically get a masterclass in what converts. Then I take that inspiration and add my own twist to it. Sometimes it's color schemes, sometimes it's layout variations, but the core structure is based on what's already proven to work. I mostly upload ad templates, gradients, and design elements. A lot of it is stuff I make while warming up before actual client work or things I created for projects but didn't sell the IP to.\n\nThe Background Stuff - GPT Apps ($100-200/month)\\[I know it's been said 100 times on the sub alr\\]  \nI saw a post on this sub a few days back about someone using their spare time to do GPT apps and it reminded me that this is something I've been doing too. I replaced my scrolling time with these apps. Like instead of mindlessly going through Instagram or Twitter for 20 minutes, I'll open one of these apps and do surveys or game offers.\n\nI'm pulling around $100-200/month from a mix of survey platforms and game reward apps. Some months are better than others depending on what's available, but it averages out to that range.  \nThe biggest shift for me was understanding the difference between trading time for money and building assets that pay you repeatedly. The Canva stuff is asset building. I make a template once and it earns for years. The reward apps are time trading, but low effort time that I'd waste anyway. If you're just starting out, don't sleep on things that seem small or beneath you. I almost didn't start with reward apps because I thought it was kind of lame. But even $100 is real money and it required basically zero skill to start.  \nAnd if you have any creative skills at all, seriously look into Canva's creator program. The Meta Ad Library trick alone is worth trying, even if you're not uploading to Canva. It's free market research. Anyway, this sub planted a lot of these seeds for me so figured I'd give back.",

          "body": "Coming from corporate finance you should actually have a really good leg-up in that you understand money better than the average Joe.\n\nMy main strategy is grid-trading. Without going into too much detail I focus on a top 20 crypto that  has pretty much stayed in the $12-30 range for the last few years. I have a bot that simply automates sales orders every time the price fluctuates 1.5%. This isn’t enough to replace my day job when you average out the good &amp; bad periods and even if it was I’d probably just divert that income to other investments for the time being but it’s enough that if I suddenly got laid off it would cover my bare minimum under realistic but bad conditions and potentially exceed my day job during short periods of high volatility.\n\nExtremely low effort and surprisingly high ROI but there is a fair amount of fluctuation due to the market plus the risk that it could all go to zero. Also a reasonable but respectable amount of capital is involved (think a year’s worth of salary).\n\n\n\n\nA shocking percent of people in the investing space have very little knowledge of accounting, forecasting, understanding financial ratios, hedging, etc so you could possibly create content to address that gap and get better returns by using “sweat equity” instead of cash to get the ball rolling.\n\nAt the end of the day though you have a few factors you gotta balance: time, capital, risk, and required returns. You can make a ton of money with little risk and little effort if you have a lot of money to start with,  can make a lot of money with little upfront effort if you are willing to lose it all, you can put in a ton of time and build something that will reward you down the road, etc.\n\n\nThere is no such thing as a free lunch so you gotta tweak the inputs to get where you are comfortable but passive income isn’t a myth but you do gotta temper expectations. It’s unrealistic to think that you can replace your day job with zero effort and $1k. But depending on how much effort &amp; capital you are willing to invest you can build a nice revenue stream.",

I was not trying to build a big brand, just something simple that could run quietly on its own.\n\nHere’s what i did:\n\n* Choose custom ceramic mugs and a few small customizable accessories like key chains and desk items. They are affordable and work well as gifts also people tend to reorder. It also felt like a good option for anyone who wants to start something new without going all in.\n* Used a product designing tool in which I wrote a simple product description and it generated a basic tech pack I could send to manufacturers. That made it much easier to explain sizes, materials, print areas and finish without confusion or multiple revisions.\n* Build everything through Instagram. No ads at the start. I treated it like a small shop and did clear product posts with pinned pricing, highlights answering common questions and real reviews.\n\nOnce I saw repeat questions and orders I simplified everything. Fixed mug sizes, limited options, saved replies and a clear order flow. Now it stopped feeling like daily work and takes very little time to maintain. Orders still come from posts I made months ago. It is not fully passive but gives low stress and actual profit.\n\nHave you started a business this year or are you planning to start one next year? Share experiences and thoughts.\n\n",

      "selftext": "Hi guys! I’m a 1st year college student in the Philippines. One of my main goals this year is to earn money and become financially independent as early as possible. However, I’ve noticed that it’s really hard to find jobs here as a student since most employers prefer college graduates or people with prior work experience. Because of that, I’m looking for realistic ways to earn while studying. Can you guys suggest side hustles, online jobs, or beginner-friendly income ideas that are doable for students in the Philippines? Any advice or personal experiences would really help. Thank you!",

The one that is relatively low effort/bordering on passive: Social media pages (mostly Facebook, but starting to spread out).    \n   \nI started a Facebook page over the summer with the intent to monetize it. It finally happened about 2 weeks ago. The money isn't great yet (~$200/mo), and I definitely made some mistakes that are impacting that, but I'm learning and there's a pretty clear path to scale the money. I think it could be \"good enough\" income for me within the span of a month, and full-time job replacement income within 6 months. I'm able to spend part of an afternoon making and queuing up posts once every two weeks. So not fully passive, but pretty low effort.   \n    \nAnd that's just from content monetization (i.e. just getting paid to post). No affiliate marketing, no selling anything (although I'm working on print on demand stuff), no brand deals. I would like to sell my own merch, but the rest of the stuff I don't want to deal with, and shilling someone else's stuff doesn't really mesh with what I've made.    \n    \nI'm trying to settle on what my true attempt #2 is going to be, but I have a basic framework mostly narrowed down.",

      "selftext": "Hi reddit, so in the last three months I've made a little over $1200 using ( what I think ) is a simple workflow I've built. Let me explain\n\nI'm junior account &amp;  just want to make some extra money for Christmas, I already had this workflow built but just for financial news. Its connected to Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok &amp; various other news outlets &amp; social media platforms. Then it alerts me of new stories before they hit the big platforms.\n\nThree months ago I started using my workflow to take trades on polymarket, thus this post. Its been fruitful so far. I get alerts on underreported news &amp; place trades on outcomes before the market reacted &amp; that's about it. Its not a sure fire method in the slightest, nor is it something super lucrative, &amp; it is risky as I often have to filter out fake news but it has been helpful as far as side hustles go.\n\nNow, I'm sure some of you are aware that this isn't exactly passive but I will be using this month to fix that issue. I'm currently working on making the workflow place the trades for me as well. Once this is done &amp; tested, I'll share an update.\n\nWhat i really wanted to share with you guys is that you should overlook the simple things, you never know, a simple system you use could be a money maker under different circumstances.\n\nAlso I apologize if this is super short, I really dont know how to explain, but feel free to ask questions &amp; ill try to answer as much as possible.",

So my only advice: pick something you really enjoy out of them and stick to it the most. If you put all your time in to so many other side hustles you’ll never get there. Put most of your time in to one you really enjoy and you’ll get there. And it’s not a sprint: you won’t make it in a day or week. People take months and even years before seeing a profit. So if you’re not in it for the long haul and growth then get a real job, finish school, and mature some then try. Not saying you’re too young, but if you don’t have discipline and patience you won’t succeed. Or at least from the people I’ve seen with those mentalities.",

It was a lecture for a college class, no one was mic-ed except the professor and he asked a lot of questions to the students. I had to determine the different students with only the audio, like if one answered more than 1 question i had to be able to recognize their voice. no video came with the audio. I submitted it several times and it was rejected for failing to properly identify speakers correctly, despite the otherwise accurate transcription of what was said. that was very frustrating.\n\nanother job involved a non-native english speaker with a strong accent.\n\nbasically, the starting jobs seemed to be the jobs the seasoned workers didn't want to touch. if i remember right, the more jobs submitted and the better the accuracy, the higher priority one could get for the easier to transcribe work.\n\nthe time required and the pay for that time wasn't really that good for someone like me, my typing average at the time was about 65wpm at 99% accuracy which i admit, isn't that impressive, basically the bare minimum needed for the jobs.\n\nif you are a fast and accurate typer, have good listening skills and hearing, it might be feasible if you stick with it. especially if you have and know how to use the foot pedal transcription things. you still might get work rejected however, sometimes for reasons that seem unfair or don't make sense. having a low rating at the beginning can prevent more work from becoming available.\n\njust my take on it, like i said, it was awhile ago and maybe they have changed. it is a legit company though. i did get paid. it was not easy and not much.",

I intend to touch on the corners that I didn’t see explored much on these posts. \n\nI started out learning about running a business and started my own experimentally before i considered myself an entrepreneur. \n\nI started learning skills long before i considered myself an entrepreneur. I filed for my first llc etc; long before i needed to, and did a lot of derping around as do many of us. \n\nThe things I would say I learned that would have sped up the process was, consistency, in particular if your plan requires building and nurturing an audience. Also take advantage of Ai. Sure you can be successful without it, probably. But why make it harder on yourself? Be mindful of shiny object syndrome. The strength i already had was willingness and vision to pivot.\n\nI did make some money as a consultant as I’ve built out other things. I had a client who was previously a CFO and I learned a lot through that.\n\nLearn from whoever there is to learn from. Make sure they actually have success and know what they are talking about. Be very mindful of any partnerships or collaborations you make. \n\nTo bring another important perspective I haven’t seen much of on this thread, the people in your life have a huge impact on your success. So does self awareness. There’s a higher prevalence of things like narcissist personality disorder and adhd (me lol) in entrepreneurship, so self awareness and solid boundaries and genuine confidence are super important. Yes there are people who don’t have these who are successful, but it definitely makes it easier. You will learn all of these things the hard way if you don’t learn it with intention. \n\nBe mindful of bottle necks, and learn to take calculated risks. Those that are risk averse tend to be less likely to get to this level as well. \n\nYou are in control of your own time and life. You will find how much of the time we tend to spend doing busy work that doesn’t actually move the needle. Failure is feedback. That’s it. \n\nYour self care MATTERS. I have spent countless time living off of redbull and prayer. Learning balance gives you a clear head and the opportunity to make better decisions. \n\nWhatever you struggle with today and master tomorrow is an important opportunity. Especially if you struggled because you couldn’t find the thing you needed and had to create your own solution. Simple is almost always better.",

      "selftext": "I’m posting this because I keep seeing people online claiming they’re making money with AI, side hustles, tools, prompts, whatever. I tried. Properly. And it went nowhere.\n\nThis wasn’t “get rich quick”. I was aiming for a very modest amount per month. Something realistic. I’ve worked in large organisations for years, so I approached it like a real project, not hype.\n\nHere’s what actually happened.\n\nFirst I tried starting a blog (WordPress). That alone took way more time than expected. Setup, themes, plugins, decisions everywhere. No clear design. And the chatbot had absolutely NO CLUE about how to create and build a wordpress blog, even though it constantly told me how to do it, only to find that that was impossible then kept blaming Wordpress for changing its UI.  SO annoying.\n\nThen I spent several weeks building a Ghost blog site. The idea was AI would surface rumours and I’d investigate or debunk them. This fell apart completely. AI could not provide *any* reliable sources for any rumour it generated (and it generated A LOT!) Since provenance was the whole point, the project was dead. If I couldn't prove there was a rumour, how could I disprove, reject or corrorobate it?\n\nIn parallel I put up 4 Fiverr gigs. Carefully written with AI leading the way on how to correctly create a gig for maximum exposure. Low prices. Clear scope. Weeks later, zero orders. Maybe something comes eventually, but there’s no sign yet that this works at all. OK, probably not directly attributable to AI, BUT - it was AI that led me down this rabbit hole...\n\nI also explored a bunch of other AI-related service ideas. Every single one sounded OK until I asked basic questions like:  \n\\-who is actually paying?\n\n\\-why would they pay someone who is basically cold calling them?\n\n\\-what work already exists?\n\n\\-what cost is being replaced?  \nOnce you force those answers, most ideas collapse pretty fast.\n\nCosts weren’t huge but they were real:  \nChatGPT Plus \\~$50  \nGhost blog \\~$20  \nPlus six weeks of focused time\n\nReturn so far: zero.\n\nWhat bothers me is how misleading the public narrative is. From what I can see, most people “making money with AI” fall into one of four categories:\n\n1. they already had an audience\n2. they’re selling to people who want to make money with AI\n3. they’d earn the money anyway and AI gets the credit\n4. they’re exaggerating or lying\n\nAI is useful. I still use it. But as a way for an individual to create *new* income from scratch? I just don’t see it.\n\nI am posting this because negative experiences don’t get shared much, and I suspect a lot of people are quietly finding the same thing and assuming they’re the problem.\n\nI don’t think I was.\n\nPostscript - and THIS is ironic.  I got the chatbot to write up exactly why you should not use AI in the way I wanted to generate a small income. But Reddit would not accept it because it was written by an AI!!  So even *criticising* AI monetisation using AI tools can get you blocked from the places where the warning would matter most!",

Like responding to emails at 11pm, hopping on calls whenever they wanted, basically being their personal support bot.\n\nMy retention was okay, around 65% after 6 months which isnt terrible but not great either. Then in October I had some personal stuff come up and I literally had to set boundaries. Started blocking out actual work hours, stopped responding to non urgent stuff after 6pm, and told clients upfront that I batch my communications twice a day.\n\nI was honestly scared theyd leave. But the opposite happened? My retention jumped to like 89% over the last 3 months. Clients seem happier, they respect the boundaries, and weirdly they value my input MORE now. I think because Im not constantly available Im forced to be more strategic with my responses instead of just reactive. Im working probably 15 hours less per week and somehow I've actually got some money set aside ($2.3k from Stаke) now which never happened before. Sometimes doing less is actually the move.",

When you’re always on, clients start to treat you like support instead of an expert. Putting structure around your time changes that dynamic and makes your input feel more intentional.\n\nBatching communication also forces better thinking. You’re not just reacting to every message, you’re responding with context and strategy, which is what clients are actually paying for. The retention jump kind of proves most clients don’t want 24/7 access, they want clarity and confidence.\n\nA lot of agency owners only learn this after burning out.

      "selftext": "I've been mentoring startups for many years now. Thought I'd share some advice over a few posts that I always end up giving new entrepreneurs starting out. Here's one:\n\nDo not quit your job! At least not right up front. You made up your mind to quit and start a company. Fantastic. My advice is not to quit your job to pursue your company full time until the last possible moment. While you are still working (and getting paid!) spend six months or so in the evenings planning. Get a team together, do your research, build a business plan, go another level deeper and get all of the detail of product development and the company administration planned out.\n\nBuild as much of your company as possible while someone else is footing the bill for your survival. I can't tell you how many times I've had this discussion and when I say this the founder hangs their head a little. My response - you quit your job already, didn't you? Founding a successful company is hard enough without putting the (unnecessary) added pressure of having to worry about survival money on the first day. Even if you've saved, why not use a continuing salary from your current job to get going.\n\nMore in future posts. Hope this helps some.",

Believe me, the corporate world isn't going anywhere, you'll have plenty of time to get into a career if you really feel like it later, but use your freedom and time to build and shape something that truly makes you happy. Good job on the bachelors too !",

Example they may hate their boss and hate being at work every day, while I bet you like yours ;)  I hope lol.  But I work with a lot of entrepreneurs, and I can tell you almost across the board they're feeling it the same way you are.    \n  \nThe ones who are growing aren't growing as much as they had hoped. Three of my long-term clients decided to retire early and close their business because the impacts of tariffs made their business no longer feasible. Others struggling with softer sales than anticipated. So it's not just you, but I also know how you feel ... we all do.  And you're not unemployed, you are SELF-employed. Sometimes that mental shift helps.   \n  \nThe fact that your business is still going means it has NOT failed, because it's still going.

None of your friends have become doctors, and hardly even nurses after two years.\n\nWhat do you mean you've always been an entrepreneur at heart? you just started your adult life.\n\nI don't want to give life advice, it's all about you and how you want to live your life.  If you really have entrepreneurial spirit this is most likely what you should explore. If you want to be a doctor as well, be an entrepreneurial doctor. Become a dentist and aim for a chain of dental clinics. Become a surgeon and instead of curing people fill up their boobs, or much easier, just spend your days injecting some tiny amounts of liquid into their lips and muscles for massive profits. You can be passionate about heart surgery yet invent a non existing procedure or device and make millions upon millions, and you can do that probably do similar in almost any medical specialty.\n\nNurses? overworked and probably underpaid. Doctors? mostly very busy, stressed, have no life, and probably therefore even if well paid are underpaid, since they have no life and are literally giving their life away to the job.\n\nYou quite simply need to decide what you want to be and how your want to live, and what kind of lifestyle you want in the future.\n\nSo what if your first business is failing or failed, or your second or third. If and when you make it, you could retire while watching your peers give their lives away for \"good pay\" and status, but literally having no life. However, you could also keep on failing forever, or at least not making it the way you want to and they took over in any way that you consider as a success, be it home ownership, an expensive car, a trophy wife, or whatever else people compare themselves with, with their peers.  None of that is a guarantee of any degree of happiness. In fact I guess most people are unhappy, frustrated or jealous in some shape or form.  Life and your choices are filled with risks, and you need to be able to live with your choices.\n\nYou are right to start thinking about this early, however, you need to always be vigilant and decide what is best for you, and what your path is, and be flexible at allowing yourself to make a change at any moment.\n\nTry to look far into the future, and think where you REALLY want to go.",

Most contractors can receive it within 1-2 days.\n\nPayoneer works well too and some freelancers prefer it cause they can keep money in USD and withdraw locally when rates are good.\n\nReal talk though - just ask your contractors what they prefer. Some countries have better options than others. Like in Philippines, GCash or local banks might be easier. In India, direct bank transfer through Wise works great.\n\nSet a specific pay date (like 1st and 15th of month) and stick to it so you're not constantly managing who got paid. Automate reminders so you don't forget.\n\nThe 10% fees you're seeing are prob from using the wrong method. Switch to Wise or Payoneer and it drops to 1-3% depending on country.",

I am not proud of what I have become but nothing excites me more than Entrepreneurship so games get boring, even social media becomes boring, sort of everything. Anyone who has ever had this problem and how they overcame this identity addiction please give me some advice. Thank you\n\nEdit: Thanks you guys for the concern and advices. I just want to let you guys know that I like Entrepreneurship not for the money but the joy of building. The reason I made this post is because I noticed myself being a boring person with no hobbies but Entrepreneurship. Hence, I wanted to ask advices on hobbies similar in likes of Entrepreneurship or something that I can engage as much fun in Entrepreneurship. Thanks!",

Being that fully involved dad with  the ability to provide without worry is the obsession.       Kind of boring in regards to flash and clout  yet I decide  my   time spent being a  cool dad with  resources to make my children's dreams a reality.

Actually I admire people who can be so passionate about anything. \nI really do think that if you want to get really good at something, you have to invest a majority of your time and energy into it &amp; of course it’s difficult to excel at something like entrepreneurship and then at the same time have several hobbies. \nI think it’s okay to have one thing that you are really good at and really care about, rather than being someone, who’s kinda good and kinda interested in many things, but in a way not extemely passionate about anything in patricular at all. \n\nIf you’re worried about being boring to other people, I think you should surround yourself with other entrepreneurially spirited people, you can connect over your passion. Same goes for dating, if you care about that: being with a person who shares your passion for whatever is the most amazing feeling. You can talk about them for hours about the specific thing you have a shared interest in. \n\nHowever, if it’s really causing you distress, that you feel like all you can think about is entrepreneurship, then to me it sounds like you’re in a bit of a burnout actually. \nMaybe you are overwhelmed and don’t actually have the mental capacity to care about anything at all. \nMaybe you could have a break where you get away from your routine for a while and try something new, like going to a pottery class, skiing, hiking - whatever it is that can take your mind off things and maybe reinvigorate you.\n\nFinding a new hobby, although this shouodn’t be the goal, will also help you achieve more in your entrepreneurial endavours because you’re able to switch your mind off and actually think more creatively again therefore be better at problem solving.\n\nPs: don’t listen to people calling you boring, you are not, rest assured!!",

At 23 I was hitting numbers that looked great from the outside. But internally I was constantly stressed, exhausted, and close to burning out. Not because the business was failing, but because I had built it in a way that worked against who I actually am.\n\nI was showing up in sales calls, client conversations, and daily work in ways that didn’t feel authentic. It felt like I had to perform a version of myself every day. Over time that creates a huge mental tax, even if things look “successful” on paper.\n\nThe hardest realization for me was understanding that you can build something profitable that still drains you if it’s misaligned. I spent years thinking the heaviness was just part of the grind. Only later did I see that the business itself was designed wrong for me.\n\nWhat I’d do differently much earlier is design the business around how I actually want to work, communicate, and think. Money matters, obviously. But being able to wake up and say “this feels like me” matters more long-term. That shift alone removed more stress than any revenue milestone ever did.",

      "selftext": "My journey started out of necessity, not ambition. I was working at a truck repair shop when management kept making these insane decisions - one after another. Me and my coworkers eventually had enough and quit. At the time, I didn't realize I was about to become an entrepreneur.  \n  \nThe next few weeks were a blur. I was hustling just to keep the lights on - reselling stuff on eBay, fixing phone screens, building basic websites for friends. Whatever paid the bills. One night while I was down the reddit rabbit hole, I ended up on r/Entrepreneur and saw this post about someone crushing it with their cleaning company. I remember thinking 'why not? I could do that.' I’m writing this post hoping it inspires someone reading this as it did to me back then.   \n  \nStarting off was rough. I had no idea how to find cleaners, price jobs or even structure the business. The first website? Just a cookie-cutter theme that every other cleaning company was using. But it worked well enough to get us started. As we grew, I realized the website needed to be better - this wasn't just some placeholder anymore, it was an actual asset bringing in money. So I invested in a proper logo and custom site. We kept on growing but felt limited by leads we were getting as most of them were paid. The cost to acquire clients was high and we wanted to convert as many as we can - which presented its own challenges.  \n  \nThis prompted us to look at how to rank our website which took me on another trail I wasn’t ready to go down on. The first overseas team we worked with ranked us but for landing pages built on their website and for keywords no one was searching for! At that time I didn’t understand long tail keywords or much related to the art of sending signals to google. I soon moved on and tried my luck locally. We hired a local firm on a premium retainer basis and under a year-long contract to deliver us that sweet local organic traffic we hoped would result in bookings. A year later? Barely anything to show for it. Started investigating and found out the blog content I paid for was recycled from their other cleaning clients. The back-link strategy? Just a web of links between all their customers. I was beyond pissed when I figured it out.\n\n  \nAt that point, I'd been burned enough that I just started learning it myself. Optimized our Google Business Profile, rebuilt the website properly, created actual useful content and a bunch of other stuff - the agencies should've been doing way back. We started to see the organic leads increase month by month and stopped relying on paid leads eventually. It took years and cost me way more than it should have, but it was worth every headache to finally have this figured out. \n\n  \nPerhaps it's too soon to be writing this out here because it's only just the beginning but I wanted to connect with other entrepreneurs who've been on similar journeys. The road gets lonely sometimes, and hearing other people's stories - the wins, the failures, the pivot moments - that's what keeps me going.  \n  \nI’d love to read your stories about how you became or plan to become an entrepreneur. Cheers!",

It stung, but those failures taught me more than any success could have.\n\n\n\nWhat kept me going was the same thing that kept you going - consistency.

      "selftext": "Recently, I traveled a lot around the world as an entrepreneur, and I realized something uncomfortable:\n\nIf you want to build something truly **ambitious** and **scalable**, operating from **Western** **countries** still gives you a massive advantage.\n\nI’m not talking about freelancers or solopreneurs who want to build a small service business and enjoy the sun and cocktails after work. That’s a perfectly valid choice.\n\nI’m talking about founders who want to leverage **talent**, **capital**, **infrastructure**, and **speed**.\n\nWe tend to underestimate the value of being born or operating in Western countries nowadays. Yes, there is a lot to criticize and improve, no system is perfect, but the legacy you inherit is invaluable.\n\nWhen a founder operates with a team, efficiency matters. You don’t have time to constantly deal with:\n\n* people not being punctual (and it being “normal”)\n* deadlines not being respected (and it being “okay”)\n* feedback not being taken seriously\n* lack of accuracy and accountability\n\nIn many Southern countries, people are raised in environments where predictability is not a priority. A predictable environment with fewer frictions and fewer surprises is something many people in Western cultures take for granted.\n\nAs a founder, you end up wasting an enormous amount of energy on things that are **not core to your business**.\n\nThe hardest part is this:\n\nSome people accept this as “part of the culture” and don’t want to improve it, because changing it feels like betraying their identity and you are the one told you’re taking things too seriously.\n\nI know this is a sensitive topic, and I’m not trying to generalize or stigmatize anyone.\n\nBut as a founder, you don’t have the luxury of failing because of things that have nothing to do with your product, your market, or your execution.",

If you're in an expensive market, bootstrap longer or find early revenue.\n\nThe founders who succeed aren't necessarily in the \"best\" location.

      "selftext": "I started my business in April 2025, so officially less than 12 months. Started negative and used my credit card to fund the business.\n\nLittle back story about myself. I’m a carpenter by trade. Always been entrepreneurial and had an interest in business/making money. Didn’t come from money. Had a few small businesses over the years, some failed, others just weren’t viable. \n\n2025 started rough for myself. I experienced severe anxiety for the first time. Spent 2024 hustling and trading. Managed to build up an account to multiple 6 figs but got greedy and lost majority of it at the end of the year. Even lost my finances 10k that she trusted me with. I had to come clean and admit what I had done.. it was one of the hardest conversations of my life. \n\nThat leads me into the business, obviously having lost a significant amount of money, still had a job. I had to figure out ways to earn more to somehow get myself out of the hole I dug.\n\nSo I started doing a few cash jobs on the side, outside of work hours.\n\nInstalling basic shower screens, found work from apps where people posted jobs they needed done and I could quote/compete with others. \n\nAfter a few months of doing a few jobs a week. I could see there was profit to be made and the jobs had a quick turn over. 1 job in 45mins in some cases with profit of 50-60% \n\nSo I built a website with the help of AI, very basic, stock images and a few of images from\n\nI had done. Then I setup a Google ads campaign. Very basic, just let Google guide me. (I did have some previous experience with Google ads). \n\nWithin 10mins of the campaign being live. I had a form enquiry, I actually couldn’t believe it. Here I was laying in bed. I showed my fiancé and she brushed it off but I got excited, thinking if I can get a lead from $25 campaign.. imagine how many I can get if I increase my budget.\n\nWell the next day I increased to $50 a day.. and sure enough the leads increased. Here I was at work, phone ringing and emails coming through. Booking in as many jobs as I could. I could earn my weeks wage in a day - so I had to make a decision and speak to my fiance. Knowing I had a secure income, 150k a year and just lost a heap of money a few months prior. I didn’t expect her to support me, but she did.\n\nSo I took the leap. It was hard work, I was doing everything and sure enough had no idea how to run a business. Constantly learning, I had no idea what was involved and the amount of work behind the scenes. \n\nFast forward to now. I now have 2 employees. We are on track to do $1M revenue in the first year of business with 20% net profit. I still don’t have a factory, working out of the garage for as long as possible. \n\nThe goal is to expand to other states but first build the business and systems, test and ensure it’s a well oiled machine.

      "selftext": "At the start of 2025 I got into an online business model. For months I was just learning, watching videos, studying etc. I’ve always been better at talking than doing, but I really did understand the model inside and out.\n\nBy September I finally took the leap and it actually worked. Within two weeks I was earning, and in November I made over $20,000. For the first time I felt like \"oh damn im actually gonna make it\"\n\nBut then I messed up... I lost more than half of it because of a platform policy violation. Honestly, I could've avoided it but it is what it is.\n\nAround the same time, a guy I’d been talking to since February basically disappeared from my life. We had over 100k messages between us and talked every single day about this business. He started building a tool, I helped him, and we became partners. I genuinely thought we were building something together. Then he found loopholes in our contract and cut me out to work with someone else.\n\nSo within a few weeks, I lost a lot of money and someone I thought had my back.\n\nI’m 18 and still live with my parents. I pay my share of the bills and I have enough saved to get through 2026 without a job, so I’m not in danger or anything. But mentally, I’ve been stuck. I wake up around 1pm, watch YouTube, play games, tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve fixed a few small habits, but I just can’t get myself to actually work again.\n\nAt night it’s worse. I stay up until 3am because when I try to go to bed I either feel lonely or my brain won’t shut up. I do have a girlfriend, and honestly, all I want long term is to be able to provide for her one day. That’s what drives me deep down. But right now, I just feel like I lost my momentum and don’t know how to get it back.\n\nI’m not looking for hustle clichés or “just grind harder” advice. I’m just wondering how people get themselves moving again after losing money, trust, and confidence all at once.\n\n**TL;DR:** Built an online business at 18, made good money, lost most of it due to a mistake, then got cut out by a partner I trusted. Now I’m stuck, barely working, sleeping badly, and trying to figure out how to start again.",

Not because you need it or you're out of shape or anything, because it will help focus some of your energy, and I'm sure you got some angst built up. Put all that to good use and start lifting weights, do it for 90 days and see how you feel. \n\nIt won't really change anything, but I promise you will feel better. Cardio is good too, I just lift, it helps so much just a lift heavy, makes you feel really good afterwards. Do it everyday, because every day you will get a boost from it. Try to do it first thing in the morning, but just do it every single day even if it's not like a huge thing. I spend about 30 to 45 minutes in the gym everyday, it ain't life-changing, it's enough to boost me through the day. \n\nBetter than any drugs I ever tried.",

And did you start with stores then go online or vice versa?\n\nFor context, I run a B2B SaaS focused on retention analytics.

After I paid my attorney and hospital bill, I had about $140k which I used to buy 2 beater homes in my neighborhood. After 5 years of fixing them up and trying to find reliable tenants, I practically just barely broke even on them after paying for materials, labor, and loss of rent from 3 separate tenants across both homes refusing to pay and waiting out the eviction process; the first \"tenant\" was a squatter, the second lost his job, and the third just had a laundry list of excuses every month, it was an absolute nightmare. I made no income since all of the rent money from one home was being reinvested into the other, and once it seemed like things were going good, my tenants would stop paying. Since selling last year, I continued working in transportation with my CDL and am almost done with my BS in finance and accounting which I am finishing online. My entire net worth of $200k is mostly liquid, I own a few ETFs, a couple individual stocks, some Bitcoin, and my car. I have no debt, I max out my Roth every year, and my student aid will cover the rest of my degree which I'm finishing this December.\n\nMy problem is that I have no idea what I'm doing really. I don't want to drive a truck forever, and if the career I want to go into doesn't work out right away (personal finance), then I'll be driving this truck for who knows how many more years. I don't want to buy my own truck or start my own transportation business, and anyone who does is probably insane. I'm not wanting to become filthy rich, I just want to have fun and make enough money to pay my bills and take care of my family when the time comes for me to start one.\n\nJust interested to hear what you guys would do if you were me. I'm not sure if I'll take a huge plunge into something different right away, but I would love to shake things up this year. I am not happy in my career, and I'm willing to take a risk to change that and be my own boss. Just looking for some inspiration.\n\nThanks!",

You’ve already learned one of the hardest lessons early (landlording isn’t passive and tenant risk is very real), you have zero debt, real capital, a finance/accounting degree about to finish, and a high-income fallback skill that pays the bills while you experiment. That combo gives you something most people don’t: time and optionality. I wouldn’t rush into another capital-heavy business or try to “force” entrepreneurship right now. Instead, I’d keep the CDL as a safety net, tighten your investments into something boring and diversified, and start testing low-risk paths aligned with where you’re already leaning: personal finance content, fee-only advising later on, or even a small solo service like bookkeeping, tax prep, or financial coaching once you’re properly licensed. Those paths let you build credibility, income, and autonomy without lighting your capital on fire. You don’t need a huge plunge to change your life this year; you need controlled experiments while preserving your downside. You’re not lost, you’re just early, and you’ve earned the right to be patient while you build something you actually enjoy.",

If your goal isn’t to get super rich then there’s really no need for risking that capital to start a business at this time. Continue to focus on long term investments in the market, especially with ETFs. That money will compound in no time. I would also look into house hacking, you can get a traditional loan on a 1-4 unit residential property, live in one unit and rent out the others. You can essentially live for free while building equity in the house. Eventually you can move out and rent the other unit and turn a profit as well. Rinse and repeat and before you know it you own multiple properties increasing your net worth as the properties get paid down and increase in value. The main goal is to buy assets, especially ones that can cash flow. Whatever they may be, holding on to a lot of cash and just letting it sit is never good because it’s losing value. Get your degree, get a good job (with growth potential) and keep being responsible with your money. If you eventually wanna roll the dice on a business idea, go for it but it has to align with your goals. But remember, no 9-5 will be harder than starting your own business. You’re in a good position right now to really set yourself up for when you are in your 30s and 40s. Best of luck.",

A game I used to play 20 years ago, one I still enjoy.\n\nThis leisure time is one of the things that helps me unwind and not think about the business after I've drained my battery on it; any other input in business would be unproductive.\n\nHowever, I found that the morning after playing a few games, I feel even more mentally fatigued. I assume this is because I've exhausted 100% of my mental capacity, and then a gaming session, which pushes it to 110% or more, draws on reserves from another day.\n\nMy dilemma is that, for me, games are one of the best ways to unwind and not think about the business. But games are also what drain my energy for the business.\n\nI wanted to ask you, entrepreneurs who also enjoy gaming: how do you approach this? Did you just quit gaming, or how did you reorganize your time?",

It shuts your brain off from work, yeah, but it does not let it recover.\n\nWhat clicked for me is there are different types of off. Anything competitive still hits the same mental system I need for work. So I didn’t quit gaming, I just boxed it in hard. No ranked. No long sessions. And never on nights before heavy days. Sounds boring but the next day fog mostly disappeared.\n\nSwapping some sessions helped too. Walking with music. Light gym, not chasing numbers. Even mindless YouTube. Feels less satisfying in the moment but you wake up way clearer.\n\nTiming matters a lot. Gaming when you’re already mentally cooked is the worst combo. If I play now it’s earlier in the evening, strict stop time, and not every day. Maybe two or three times a week. Otherwise it leaks into tomorrow exactly like you described.\n\nI don’t think quitting gaming is the answer. It’s more accepting that some games are mentally expensive and you have to budget them like energy, not time. Business drains you, Dota drains you, stacking them back to back overdrafts tomorrow.\n\nAlso random thought. Intense games wreck sleep quality even if you fall asleep fine. That alone can explain the morning fatigue.\n\nShort version. Keep gaming, just treat it like caffeine. Nice, useful, enjoyable, but wrong dose at the wrong time messes you up the next day.",

I’d rather play solo or with others because they take that shit way too seriously to the point of getting toxic. The games themselves are pretty tense.\n\nThat’s why I got myself a VR headset and been cycling through some of the best VR games and trying out some old classic. Right now I’m doing Doom 3. Another positive about VR is that I don’t normally do more than 40-60 minutes because it gets a bit headachy after hours, unless maybe if you’re used to it. This gives me the break I need, to get back to work.\n\nI balance it out with exercise, and taking family out somewhere. Through the years, when I really was feeling mentally down, I would go on for runs. Eventually ran about 10-12 miles a few times. It helped understand that sometimes I tell myself I’m tired and done, but I could always can push a little further. That had a positive effect on other metal activities. Now I have a walking treadmill, kettlebells, dumbbells, pull up bar and a bench.\n\nWe should hop on some game some time. Maybe you’ll be able to help me out with marketing.",

Instead of just dropping the price like I normally would, I was honestly just tired and broke down exactly what everything cost. Like I showed them the supply costs, explained labor hours, even mentioned that I keep some money saved aside (like $7k from Stаke) for equipment replacements that I factored into pricing.\n\nThey ended up booking it AND referred their realtor to us. Now I do this with most estimates when people seem hesitant and my close rate went from like 40% to almost 70%. People seem to actually appreciate seeing where their money goes instead of just getting a final number.\n\nI thought being transparent would make me look amateur or unprofessional but its been the opposite.

As smaller companies it’s more important to build a closer relationship with your clients, since we don’t cycle as many. Our repeat clients and reputation is everything so if it works, keep doing it. You’ll get a feel for what each client is after",

I'm only a few years older than you but was around the same age when I was introduced and \"required\" in a sense to take over.\n\nWhat may have worked for him in the past may not work in modern times as you mentioned, your father does not understand social media. You however do so it is left to you to follow up and try something with it as our society mostly revolves around social media now. An idea would be perhaps try to find if there are influencers (doesn't have to be incredibly famous) in your area who review food joints and treat them to a full course meal.\n\nIf the food you are serving is good and there is still business along with frequently returning customers, then that part doesn't need immediate attention. Try the influencer idea first and if traffic picks up then you will have the financial leisure to hire a head chef. This way you could perhaps add new and more modern dishes to the menu for testing. It's all trial and error at the end of the day and I believe that we are more fitted for failure than our parents who most likely started the business from scratch with no back up. However what we do have is the foundation that they have laid out for us and if one dish fails, it's not going to change much if any, just keep trying.\n\nI wish you the best of luck and hopefully provided a bit of help. It's a lot of pressure at once but I'd say both you and I are somewhat lucky to be in such a situation. A lot of people are just slaving away and would pray to be in a situation such as this.\n\nEdit: typos",

I’m talking about faculties, bruv.\n\nMeanwhile, you are busy not only optimizing everything you can (that hasn’t been done already) and making alterations that show the customers what a great tradition is continuing in the community. This is smart business.\n\nThe real transfer of leadership (despite your managerial skills) will come when the matriarchal ladies of your community make complimentary comments to your parents at their table praising you.\n\nThey get to beam proudly and always will and you learn the community grants you customer side ownership socially. The smaller the town, the more important this is.\n\nA few years later, after the menu and decor and productivity changes you made your thumbprint with are established, one day your parents won’t be sitting at their table you set for them.\n\nHave something set aside and call a travel agent and send them on a cruise for at least a couple weeks.  They will love it and reconnect with a lot of each other they didn’t have time for because of the 17 years of hustle. This will be happiness you gave them.\n\nThey will begin to spend more time at home and not too many years of your life have passed.  You have done right by them and have kept yourself in the game of “I still can go do what I want.”\n\nThis is important for your life.\n\nUr 28, and after all this transitions you will prolly be 33-35.\n\nAll this while, to yourself, you have been keeping and eye on the market around your area and the right time to sell the business will become evident.  Have a broker, a good broker lined up as things change macro economically quite quickly sometimes and let the economy save you from the emotions everyone will have, including your parents because selling would have been a big economic mistake not to jump.\n\nYour parents will understand most of all.\n\nYou will still be young, have been saving and investing all this while because your salary is in the budget like everyone else’s and you have no real reason to do anything but invest for the future anyway working your 50-60 hour weeks.\n\nIf ownership isn’t clear by gosh deadline it in the takeover talks.  \n\nThen jump when the money comes in a decent offer.  The broker is feduciarily obligated to make sure you get a fair price and you’re going to be 35, have investments and savings while you managed and a big check for the sale of the business, happy parents who couldn’t have had the takeover go any sweeter, and still have a lot of youth and years ahead of you.\n\nThere’s only one real hitch, and it’s not a bug it’s a feature- you may want to keep it going and pass it on to your kids.",

For example, the mortgage payment on your parents home is probably 50% less than if you bought their home today.  That's just one example.  My guess is also the restaurant has a lot of deferred maintenance that will cost tens of thousands of dollars/pounds to fix.  So their 100k income might work fine for their life, there's a very real chance it won't work for you in 2025/26.\n\nUltimately while it's a generous offer in many ways, it's also a bit of a poisoned chalice because they're giving you a business that requires you to do a lot of work, doesn't pay enough, and needs a bunch of money invested.\n\nThe other way to take this is a completely different option:  \"Dad, there's just no way I can take on all that you do.  I don't know how you do it.  If I take over, the business will surely fail.  I'd much rather see you sell it to someone than have to worry about taking it over and failing.\"",

This is common among business owners... if you were to open your own graphic design studio, you may find yourself doing multiple roles (and capable of doing them faster and more efficiently than hiring).\n\nThat said, first evaluate why your father is doing those roles.  It sounds like you used to have hired staff, but due to reduced revenue the roles have been cut, resulting in him doing them just to keep money going.  This is admirable.\n\nThe problem is by being so overwhelmed, everyone involved is so busy working in the business that no one is working on the business.\n\nCut items, inventory, and stock for menu items that aren't selling.  Start developing more.  Specifically designed to maximize social media appeal.  You haven't mentioned what genre of resturuant, but just rip some basic ideas.  Make a crazy complicated milkshake with a piece of pie and ice cream on the top. Sell a giant cookie shaped like a taco with ice cream in it.  \n\nIdeas has nothing to do with your genre... you have a very unique opportunity you will never have in a job:  You have an inside route to control what is or is not on the menu and likely all other related operations.\n\nIf you want to pursue graphic design, you should be doing it for the restaurant.  No reason to go to school or get a job in it, you literally can already start doing it.  \n\nYou're doing dual duty sure, but your goal of doing dual duty is to create menu items and design ads that bring in more customers.  More customers = more revenue = hiring more people.  \n\nYou would advance infinately further in your career doing this for 1 year than in a job.  If you turn the business around, you could create it into the restaurant you want to be involved in.  If you don't, you at least have a years experience in design (and business ops) and go get a better paying design job.",

But you can’t grow. \n\nUltimately, the owner needs to step out of the first employee role to become the CEO.\n\nThe next stage of development is to develop processes. A process is steps, like a recipe, to get the work done. A process can be repeated, outsourced, automated, or improved upon. This is what needs to happen next in this business. The place to start is the to write down the steps for everything that is being done. From there you can analyze if there is a way to automate those steps, hire someone cheaper to do the work, improve upon the process so it’s more efficient, or just have a checklist to follow so it’s done right the first time. \n\nFinally, the owner moves into a CEO role or hires a manager to do that. Other employees or contractors take charge of the processes while the CEO steers the company. \n\nToo many of the answers assume that the 100k is the upper limit. It’s not.

You mentioned he doesn’t do marketing, maybe that’s a lever you can pull. But bear in mind selling more is not always better, because you need more working capital for the stock, more waiting staff/,cooking staff etc. Just think it through, together with your dad as well, what you could do differently and better. In the current stage it’s a job that pays very little on an hourly basis and you’d be better off taking a role somewhere else. Beyond the sentimental value, you could most likely find a job paying you 100k a year even if not immediately but after a few years and with reasonable working hours. If you can improve the math this could be a good business too and you’d not need to start from zero either. Hospitality is known to be a hard business to make meaningful profit and as far as I know most small restaurants are like your family’s, with the family members putting in a lot of hours and only barely keeping it afloat. But there are also many restaurants that are profitable, typically more high end ones. Looking at what they are doing differently could be a good starting point.",

          "body": "My guy, this is not really a business. It is a family hobby that is being treated like a business.\n\nBefore you look at profits or future plans, you need clear answers to some very basic questions.\n\nHow much is your father paying himself.\n\nHow much is he paying you.\n\nHow much is he paying your mother.\n\nAnd most importantly, are these amounts paid before or after the stated 100K net profit. Without clarity on this, the number means absolutely nothing.\n\nThe next step is a proper financial analysis of the business. You cannot base decisions on the 100k figure. You need a full overview that includes the value of the building, the full kitchen equipment, the nearby house if that is part of the setup, and the amount of cash or liquid assets the business has. If the restaurant has been operating for 17 years, nets around 100K per year, and you say it used to be more successful, I would expect there to be a minimum of 200K to 1M in cash or equivalents. If that money is not there, you need to understand exactly where it went.\n\nYou should also separate the real estate from the restaurant business in your thinking. Check what similar buildings rent for in your area. If the property could realistically be rented out for 4K to 10K per month, your parents could still generate fifty to one hundred thousand per year in rental income while retired, and you would be free to pursue a different job.\n\nIf you are considering continuing the restaurant, do a market analysis. Look at how many people actually live in the area, how other restaurants nearby are performing, and whether this is a touristic region or are you guys fully dependent on regulars. How old is the surrounding population Are your prices too high, or are they actually too low etc...\n\nNext go through the menu in detail and recalculate your pricing. A simple rule of thumb is that if something costs you 1 dollar it should sell for at least x4 to x5 that amount. You need to calculate gross revenue, food cost, labor cost, overhead, and the actual net profit behind that 100K figure.  \nThen you need to add realistic labor costs for all the roles your father currently fulfills. Then recalculate your menu prices and ask yourself honestly whether customers would still be willing to pay those prices. If the answer is yes, you raise prices gradually. If the answer is no, then the business model itself is the problem.\n\nIf you have a decent POS system, you should be able to see exactly which items sold over the past year. Compare those numbers to your menu. Items that only sell a few times per year should be removed.\n\nAlso don't forget you have some advantages compared to people your age who want to start a restaurant business. You are not paying rent, and you do not need to buy or lease kitchen equipment. Depending on the area, that alone can be a100K per year advantage",

Your real business opportunity here is to rent it out to those kinds of people as a 'ready to go' solution, with lease terms that mean when they go pop, you can get them out quickly, benefit from any improvements they've made to launch, and get the next people in.\n\nI'm being a little facetious of course, but it's about as good an idea as taking it on yourself, if you don't want to - you're a million miles from a passive business and as soon as your old man retires, you'll be looking for replacement staff (or taking on the burden yourself) which will wipe out all of your profit, and that's assuming that the $100k was after you family took a decent wage.\n\nThe same logic will apply for selling it as a going concern. The only people this will appeal to are those looking to buy a job, and who really want to run their own restaurant and put the hours in to make it so. Anyone else should and would run a mile, and you are in that group.\n\nYour parents should either work to get it in a position where the current (or with one or two new hires) could keep it running with sufficient net profit for your dad to make a passive income, maybe with a mind to seller financing it to that team, or get some proper figures worked out and see if it makes an appealing proposition to a budding restauranteur.\n\nAlternatively, push hard for the next few years to maximise profits and then liquidate.

I sent them my llc formation docs, they rejected it. Now they're asking for a utility bill or lease agreement in the business name which I obviously don't have since im running this remotely. The whole point of the llc was to have a Us entity so I could accept payments from american customers but I cant even get to that step. How do i verifiy stripe as an international founder?

          "body": "This phase is way more common than people admit, and it hits harder than most expect.\n\nLeaving the “safe” path doesn’t just change your income, it strips away a ready-made identity. Titles, pay, and external validation disappear overnight, and there’s nothing immediate to replace them. When you’re early in building something, there’s no scoreboard yet, so it’s easy to feel like you’re floating without proof that the decision was right.\n\nWhat you said about the awkward middle really matters. That stretch where the old life is gone but the new one hasn’t solidified yet is mentally exhausting. You’re taking on risk, uncertainty, and constant decision-making without the dopamine hits that a stable career provides. It’s not surprising that nights get long and doubts get loud.\n\nPeople who come out stronger on the other side usually find ways to separate self-worth from short-term outcomes. Instead of asking “does this look successful yet,” they anchor to progress, skills gained, and control over direction. It’s a quieter kind of confidence, but a more durable one.\n\nYou’re not weak for feeling this. You’re in the part most people never see because they turn back before it passes. Hearing from others helps, but so does recognizing that this discomfort is a byproduct of growth, not a signal you failed.",

          "body": "&gt;Is there a reason why he would be doing this?\n\nPlenty. Doing this means he can decide when (or if) to pay you, so he doesn't have to factor it in much on his expense schedule. Basically, you're low-priority to him (and yes, you are being disrespected).\n\nIn addition, there is the [time value of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money) - the longer a payment can be delayed, the less it's worth in real-world value. Getting paid in January is worth more to you than having the same amount paid in September, and likewise delaying a payment means the customer is paying you less in value even if they're paying the same amount in raw numbers.\n\nTo mitigate this, you may want to look at including items in your contracts, such as late payment penalties that increase over time (and, at some point, become extreme enough to trigger payment), base rate increases (or loss of access to discounts) for customers who regularly pay late, or simply declining credit (including n30/n90 etc) for customers who have a history of late payments.\n\nIn addition, move everyone over to the new contract at the end of the current one - this guy should not be able to 'grandfather' themselves in just because they're a long-term customer; what they actually are is a long-term *deadbeat*.",

      "selftext": "I need help. I’m 15 years in and still get killed by the same thing every time a holiday or a break rolls around. I own several locations of a food business that I began 15 years ago. I employ a large number of college age people and a healthy number of 20somethings, then a group of people in their 30s and early 40s that have worked here since I started the business.\n\nThe problem we run into many times a year is we can’t grant everyone their day off requests. We can get staff really trimmed down, but we still need people to work. We have shortened hours on holidays, which are our busiest days of the year, but when we have to deny a day off request, they end up calling in sick anyway. It happened Christmas Eve, it happened again this morning.\n\nIf you have a similar business, retail or food service that needs to be open holidays (not the actual holiday but the day before), how do you handle it when literally everyone asks for the same day off? And then calls in anyway??\n\nObviously I’m frustrated this morning because I have several locations that are completely screwed and have customers picking up orders etc. etc. And I can’t be in all places at the same time.\n\nOutside of a holiday, how do you handle people calling off a shift and no one else picking it up? Do you have a sick day policy like they have have to produce a doctors note after so many days?\n\nThanks so much, any advice is welcome!\n\nEditing to add: thank you for the feedback! I appreciate it so much. We do time and a half for the holiday and day before, and at the end of the year they get a bonus for every holiday worked. For most of them, time and a half is around $25, for some it’s closer to $40. The problem is most of them don’t need the job. They’ll quit if they don’t get the days off or if we require a doctors note. They’ll argue they don’t have insurance and don’t need a job and they peace out. It wasn’t this bad a few years ago but this year and last it’s been constant.",

That can cause resentfulness pretty quickly. \n\nYou may consider doing a rotation where they get scheduled for the holidays pretty early so they have plenty of time to plan. And also try to stagger their holidays so they are working thanksgiving or Christmas but not both. That coupled with holiday pay (1.5 or 2X) gives them both time to plan around the schedule and incentive to come in profitable. \n\nI learned this a long time ago when I did farm work. Farms don’t have holidays.  It sucked getting dropped into a holiday schedule last minute, so the owner laid out the holidays well in advance (winter holidays scheduled in summer and vice versa).

          "body": "I feel this one. Hard. You are not doing anything wrong. This is one of the most frustrating realities of running a food business right now especially with a workforce that does not actually need the job.\n\nFirst off you are already doing more than most. Time and a half holiday premiums end of year bonuses. That is solid. At some point though money stops being the lever. If someone is willing to quit over working Christmas Eve no incentive was going to change that.\n\nOne thing that has helped me and others I know is intentional over hiring around holidays. You know these days are coming and you know call offs will happen. Bring in seasonal or short term people who actually want the hours. They are usually grateful not jaded and far more likely to show up. Even better if you can cross train across locations so you are not stuck when one store gets hit.\n\nIf you can swing it build a small on call bench. Pay them a small flat rate to be available and if they get called in they get the full shift pay plus the premium. It is cheaper than losing sales and sanity.\n\nThe other big piece is clear firm policies and sticking to them every single time. Holiday time off has to be first come first served. Once the schedule is posted that is it. If someone gets denied and then magically gets sick that gets documented. No drama no arguing just tracked.\n\nInstead of doctors notes which usually blow up in your face go with progressive consequences. A couple unexcused call offs fine. Keep doing it and you lose priority for holidays preferred shifts or hours. If it becomes a pattern you move on. Not as punishment just because reliability actually matters in this business.\n\nAnd honestly this is the hardest but most freeing mindset shift. Not everyone is a fit for a job that requires holidays. That is okay. But it is not optional. If someone would rather quit than work one or two key days a year they are telling you who they are. Let them.\n\nOne unreliable person can wreck an entire location burn out your good people and put you in firefighting mode all day. At some point protecting the business and the team that does show up has to come first.\n\nYou are doing your best in a tough environment. Tightening the structure is not being heartless it is how you keep the whole thing from breaking.",

Basically each quarter or month (depends on how the business works), we set aside a fixed percentage of gross profits that goes into the employee bonus pool.  All else being equal, that pool gets evenly divided across everyone who works there so long as they've worked for the whole period (you can't get hired 3 days before bonus day and get paid out).  But, anyone who has an unexcused absence during the period simply becomes ineligible for the bonus pool.  That means everyone else gets a little more and it becomes a legitimate incentive as the period goes on, more people miss a day, etc.  The only real downside in practical terms is that if someone has an attendance hit 2 days into the period, it's kind of a write-off for them to miss more days.  But, I found most of our good employees didn't have that kind of attitude anyway.  Good luck, sounds like a challenging business!",

          "body": "So there are some things you have to take into account here.  Holidays should be business closed days so everyone can spend time with their family and actually have the holiday.\n\nBeing open is a choice that comes with consequences which will always be people wanting to actually take the day off and may take the day off no matter what management says.\n\nFor Christmas I drove around to see who was open and who was closed and respecting their employees over trying to make a squeeze of profits.  Same goes with professionals in the NFL, nobody wants to work on Christmas, they want to be at home with their family and doing this year over year on Holidays really messed up their family they are trying to build and maintain.\n\nAs a business you have to think about the people that work for you and how working on a day the whole country gets off and how it makes them feel to just be there working for 1/100th of their value.\n\nNow I understand it might be a busy day, and you choose to be open because you make a ton of money but you have to pay the price for being open on a national holiday which means staff crunch.  Now if you want to show some care and love and have to be open because it is good for cashflow do so but also make sure you are paying by default holiday pay.\n\nWhy holiday pay you ask, because extra pay is how businesses actually say thank you when asking people to do things they normally wouldn't do like work on the holidays.  If this means paying them 3x or 4x their hourly rate to include overttime that will more than likely drastically reduce your problem with people calling out or taking off during this time.  You might even have the problem of too many people requesting to work during this time.\n\nMoney talks, you want to send a message to the employees that them being their is wonderful for the business let your checkbook do the talking.  I would actually recommend setting a new policy that starting January 1, 2026 Xx holiday pay will be standard going forward. Whatever that multiplier is you set it and maybe even make it variable starting at 2x and going up depending on how bad you need people there.  Send that out and make sure you send out a reminder before holidays come up weeks in advance to get bookings and make sure you have enough people on staff in case a couple of people are legitimately sick and need to stay home.\n\nJust like in big business if you want someone to work on Thanksgiving, 4th of July, Christmas, etc. it better be an emergency.  Treating these as normal work days shows zero empathy and doesn't set things well if you are also looking for people to stay long term.  Let the money speak and you'll see some serious change in your staffing situations.",

If a location has to shorten hours or close early once or twice, staff quickly realize the policy isn’t bluffing.\n\nThe hard truth is: if most of your staff doesn’t need the job, incentives stop working.

For most days this is just wages, 401k match, benefits, etc. but on a holiday with family or kids, is it worth an extra  $100-$200 probably not, think like a person that is incentivized by money like you are (people don't typically work for fun). You have more sales those days and make more money, share that with the people that make that money for you. Make them want to be there, and it's also to your benefit since you have the extra sales to support it, so they make more money, and so do you. People work for incentive, not for you, or \"rules\" lol. Employees (aka people) would rather be with their family, make it worth their while. Not sure why that is so clear to me and not others, they are people. If they are declining or \"opting out\" whatever you are offering is not enough. Make it voluntary, let them know upfront how much the bonus will be plus double time, signup for the voluntary work a month ahead of time, if no one signups add more bonus until it doesn't make sense anymore for you, and then close those days, or pay triple time and a bonus and take a loss to keep the customers happy for repeat business.

Have your employment attorney set that up for you, it is state and city specific. Don’t go cheap here, it will be pricey to set it up for first time. It will cost you a lot more if you don’t set it up correctly. \n\n2. Setup probationary period. I recommend it just under when unemployment insurance kicks in. For NY, it’s 6 months. We have ours set at 5 months and 29 days. That means, you can terminate whenever you want without dinging your UI premium.\n\n3. Setup employee duties and KPI’s. It must be clearly  stated and listed in your employee manual. Failure to meet KPI = retraining, sanction, then eventual termination.\n\n4. Evaluation - new hire are evaluated weekly for first 8 weeks. They need to know whether they’re meeting KPI’s or not. The written evaluation with KPI metrics is what legally protects you. Employee may claim any false statements, but a weekly evaluation with poor KPI and signed by both you and the employee, that is your proof that you terminated due to poor KPI, not due to whatever issue they claim. Depending on nature of the job, after 8 weeks, we do bi weekly then monthly. We switch to quarterly for all employees after probation.\n\nMost small business owners don’t do evaluations, and find quarterly to be a pain. You want to do this so you can also give bonus and rewards based on KPI’s. We give staff bonuses for monthly KPI’s and quarterly KPI. It also shows to the employee that you are the captain of the ship, employees want a leader. Most owners are not leaders therefore there's nobody manning the helm. That invites employees to start getting away with anything, such as theft, time clock theft, PTO abuse, etc. Quarterly eval and business meetings help reinforce your business vision and goals, which boost morale and focus employee energy to a productive goal.\n\nOnce you list KPI’s are not being met, give a verbal warning. Document it in their file, date, time, what you said and their response. Email yourself for time stamp proof. Employees get two verbals then written reprimands.\n\nAs the old saying is true, fire fast, hire slow. I’d talk with your employment attorney quick, prep to terminate that employee soon.\n\nFuture hiring, create a more stringent hiring system to ensure they can do the KPI’s. That employee should never have made pass the screening phase, definitely shouldn’t have made pass the interview test which should include testing the KPI’s, and if they somehow made it through and not meeting KPI, terminate within 2 weeks or sooner.",

Some cars you can get pre put together brake lines but this one you couldn't so I had to buy several different parts and special tools, my tool broke and I had to take everything to a shop for them to put the brake line together, hooked everything up, realized everything else was rusty AF and I couldn't remove the air out of the line.

I’ve been a barista for about 8 years now. I spent about 5 1/2 years In a local coffee shop and almost 3 years at a huge corporation ahem.. Starbucks which sucks and isn’t real coffee but I needed the benefits. So I have plenty of barista experience. I have been a supervisor/manager at both places. The small business i handled all of the inventory, did a lot of the marketing, a lot of the drink creating and spent a lot of my time and effort there. So I know how internally a coffee shop works and runs too but having my own business seems intimidating. I live in a very populated city, where coffee is a huge demand I’ve found a location I’d love to rent that fits the moody/ witchy vibe I’m going for (garage door, loft, rustic, dark exterior vibe) it’s apart of shopping/event center which I think would be perfect for foot traffic and exposure. There’s no coffee competition, just a hair salon, tattoo shop, bakery, pizza shop, brewery and some boutiques. I’ve done a lot of the research and have calculated the price of all of the things I’d need to do and have, my question I guess is what’s next? How do you make it happen? Is it worth it? ",

Make the coffee prices competitive but make sure you charge for every extra, and have lots of visually appealing grab and go style treats and food well displayed near the point of sale. And also try and budget for custom printed takeaway cups.

But at the end of the day, you *can* achieve 'passive income' by 'just' buying it (if you have enough money).  Labor produces income and labor is itself a commodity that can be bartered for with money.",

          "body": "You can call it whatever you want. In some ways true passive income is closer to an investment.\n\nYou calling it ;active income; makes no sense to me because no one says this. The world is more complex now and a term such as passive income doesn't really explain things or cover the entire breadth of all possible types of passive income.\n\nA better word is simply 'work'. Business takes work and it's always a gamble. The gamble on some types of businesses take longer to pay off or see a return. But lets say content creation as an example - this can take years to pay off but when you reach a certain point, you can call it passive income (to an extent).\n\nThis ties very heavily into the platforms someone chooses. If you are a streamer then your income is almost 100% tied to performing streams. If you do youtube then your income relies on you staying relevant so that your content is promoted. If you stop, your income wont stop immediately but its still tied to putting out content.\n\nI'm not saying this is a better business model than any other, but it does have unique advantages. You can quit youtube for a whole month (or longer) if you build up enough content to release on a schedule. People do this all the time. During this holiday or time off, the income is passive. But the business itself isn't truly passive.",

And actually if you see how many hours you need to invest regularly, you see that it's a job still.\n\n2) A classic example of renting out assets, such as real estate - you make several grand each month and feel that it's passive income since you rarely do much more than collecting rent, but in reality you have maintenance, depreciation, pay taxes on it, service fees, insurance, etc and have risks like insolvent tenants that would be hard to evict / vandalism, etc., and in the long run you could be far better off selling that house / apartment, putting your money into S&amp;P 500.

You don't know the odds against you for different games. You've never gained experience practicing the game, how to wager, or anything else. You Just Do It.\n\nIn this thought experiment you would rightly feel hesitation as you reach the moment of truth.\n\nBig difference being nobody in a gambling forum would explain away your hesitation. Professional gamblers could conceivably feel irked you haven't thought anything through. That is not what you face in this kind of forum, where people see rational hesitation at doing something monumentally stupid as the real problem. I suggest the heretical notion rational decision making is shunned and reckless abandon touted.\n\nTherefore I don't see what's so difficult to understand. Businesspeople wouldn't try to shut their brain off, nor would they seek out the adrenaline rush of undue risk, they engage in risk-reduction. Wantrepreneurs instead amp themselves up to recklessness and put themselves on the wrong side of the percentages.\n\nHad you read posts here, you would notice many details. People ask what is possible here, not what the probability is. Even moderately skilled gamblers make themselves aware of the odds. As they would read books on gambling. Most have what they will call a 'system' for wagering worked out, a strategy.\n\nHere, I had to write a big long post to explain the relationships between words like \"strategy\" and \"tactic\" and \"objective\" and \"technology.\" Because people were posting to ask about digital strategy and commenters would post the name of this weeks magic platform. Not why, how to use it, what to do. Just the name. And nobody even blinked.\n\nI wouldn't just hesitate. I would fold up my money, put it back in my pocket, then walk away from such a lunatic fringe. The last thing I would consider is popular advice to crap something out, market-blind and trust to the luck I just slapped in the face. These guys make a gambling addiction look like sanity.\n\nThe business answer to hesitation is study, risk-reduction, due diligence, and well-ordered thought. The quippy retorts actually posted to counter this are lunacy and almost qualify as hysterical over-reaction. I'm not advocating for delay nor do I endorse anything different from what an eighth-grade student does when writing a moderately important book report. A few days is typical for such a task and makes zero difference.\n\nPeople here behave as if books cause cancer and research is a four-letter word. Which indicates where all the bad business math comes from. Just Do It dogma causes an attitude of all gas, no brakes ...which leads them to crash their venture into a ditch. Only to post here like a distraught child with a broken toy they've come to an adult to fix. \n\nIf you're so curious, you could have scrolled through posted issues and posted an analysis.

People come to me with an idea or an existing business and I set up the administrative side, collab on the entreprenuerial side, and help them develop the \"technician\" side (the product/service in which they are the expert and I don't desire to be a part of - plumbing, building cabinets, or cleaning offices for example). \n\nHere are the main hangups I often see (in no order):\n\n* lack of understanding of what drives business success - Lets say a person wants to start or runs a new locksmithing business. You see a lot of someone thinking something like \"I need to be on TikTok but I don't know how\" to get a business started rather than \"I should go talk to the property manager of this nearby office building and ask who they use for rekeys and lockouts\" (I actually dont know anything about locksmiths but hopefully that makes sense)\n* Incorrect understanding of priorities - similar to above, but I see people focus on something like Social Media before they have their offer and audience figured out and really understand what they are trying to say and who they are trying to say it to. \n* getting overwhelmed by the different \"lanes\" - It's a lot at first to think about not just your service and customers, but also payment processing, invoicing, licenses/insurance, a website, social media, brand, bookkeeping, lead generation, SOPs, and everything else. It can be difficult to carry so many different moving parts, and shuts a lot of people down.\n* All or nothing thinking - This one is similar to the \"lanes\" but its really about overthinking and perfectionism. Believing you need to be 100% dialed in or you aren't ready. It's a good way to keep yourself working towards continuous improvement if you harness the energy, but it kills most people's ideas because you will never have a project fully dialed in before you take a step.\n* Lack of due diligence - People tend to make TONS of assumptions about demand, competition, audience, costs, and other things that they should really take the time to go gather data on - and it has NEVER been easier to get decent data on just about anything than it is now. Acting on bad assumptions has been a huge cause of wasted energy and effort with a lot of business owners I know and work with.\n* fear of networking - this one is simple. Lots of folks are just afraid to talk to people, and even more of them are affraid to talk about their business and why it is awesome.\n* a desire to do it all yourself - This is usually from a cost perspective. I build a lot of websites for clients, often as a one-off service based on referrals. I'd say at least half of the clients I work with have a website that they feel ashamed of that they attempted to build themselves and want me to help them. It is almost always that they didn't want to spend the kind of money that a lot of agencies wanted to charge them (which is also understandable because that is usually nuts also). So, they try to do it themselves. What they don't see is that the amount of time spent on it if looked at from a $/hr perspective isn't usually far off from what they would have paid someone else to do it, and they would have ended up with a decent site rather than a site that they feel does not represent the quality of their business (even if it was overpriced). Nobody would ever try this with something like taxes, but it is WAY too common with stuff like logos, social media, and websites especially. The kicker is that a plumber could be out doing paying jobs INSTEAD of spending that time building a website, which they have zero ability to do.\n\nI have worked with a ton of different types of businesses across different industries, and most of my friends run businesses of some kind, and those are the biggest ones that I see. I think this is why mentorship helps so much - you have someone who can help you see reality. \n\nIn my opinion, entrepreneurship and running a business are huge practices in checking your own thoughts and assumptions, seeing things clearly and without your own filters, and being able to look at things from different perspectives - being objective and getting out of your own way.",

Too many options, too much advice online, and not enough context from people who’ve actually done it. Reading blogs and watching YouTube helps, but it’s very different from hearing someone say, “Here’s what I underestimated, here’s what almost went wrong, and here’s what I’d do differently.”\n\n I have infact spent time talking to both first-time buyers and experienced owners — the gap between *thinking about* starting a business and *actually pulling the trigger* is often just access to the right perspective at the right time.\n\nI am also curious to hear from others here — is it more fear, lack of clarity, or something practical like capital or time that’s holding you back?",

I understand the tax savings and potential lifestyle if the small business runs itself once it becomes successful. However, the extreme mental and financial stress is something I have witnessed and I am fortunate enough not needing to do that since our family will make $700k in W-2 in a few years after my spouse finishes up residency. Only thing that is fun and low stress for us is real estate leasing since it is mostly hands off compared to running a small business but it has a capped upside but also a quite large capital investment.\n\nSo to answer your question, W-2 is comfortable and relatively stress free compared to starting a real small business from the ground up.",

      "selftext": "Edit: thanks for all the comments! I'll get back to everyone by tomorrow :)\n\nHey everyone! Just over two months ago, I launched a side project that’s quickly showing potential, and I’d love some advice on how to grow it.\n\n**The concept:**\n\n• I host regular board game nights at public venues.\n\n• Entry fee is $5 cash per person for the entire evening.\n\n• People can come alone or with friends, I place them on a table, they play games (not the niche tabletop ones, more social party games), and meet new folks.\n\n**Current setup:**\n\n• I’ve built a group on a popular social app (300+ members have joined organically, though only a fraction attend these events).\n\n• So far, attendance per event has ranged from as little as 2 ppl, to as high as 23 people (although these are the extremes, I have an average attendance of 7 ppl, and am consistently trending higher in recent events). I also happen to have a pretty good return rate, and there are now 6-8 regulars.\n\n• Upfront costs: \\~$547.22 for several board games, a few bits and bobs (pens, name badges, etc) and the app membership.\n\n• Income: \\~$645.00 in total (210 the first month, and 435 the second); I’m now officially in profit.\n\n• Venue is free (local bars or food courts), so no additional costs on my part there.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n• I want to grow attendance (30 attendees per session would be solid) and attract specific crowds (young people, 20-30, as well as more women to balance it out) and better leverage social media platforms.\n\n**Questions for you (and please share any useful advice):**\n\n• How would you scale something like this without raising prices? The $5 fee matches local board game café pricing and I want to keep it the same.\n\n• As the group grows, I'm aware that hosting duties will become more and more complicated, but I'm still unsure how to proceed - should I pay someone to help me host?\n\n• I’m struggling to reconcile my financial objectives with my willingness to make sure everyone is having a good time; basically, I’m very picky with who I invite. Most of my promo so far has been done through subreddits for the town I live in and Facebook groups – I always do a background check on people first, and have a quick chat with them to gauge the kind of person they are. I do this to avoid having problematic profiles (creeps, scammers, intolerant people, you name it) but this comes at an extra effort, and also highly limits the clients I get (I must lose 50% of potential customers with this system). I know it’s a stupid question even before I ask it, but have some of you found a good way to filter out the bad weeds in a more efficient way, or do you just take the risk to have these sorts of clients anyways?\n\n• I've had some suggestions to use a subscription system, but sounds quite complicated to set up logistically, and I like the idea of people having the flexibility of paying per session. Are there any real upsides to this system?\n\n• Creative ideas to reach more people? I'm struggling to find people in their twenties - it seems most user pools I'm targeting have 30 year olds...where are all the twenty year olds?? Same goes for finding women – very few of them seem to respond to my posts…I’m trying Instagram and TikTok which I hope might attract these crowds, but growth is painfully slow.\n\n• Anything else I should keep in mind moving forward? This is my first entrepreneurial project so I’d really appreciate any insights :)",

          "body": "I hate to be a downer but I'm not sure this makes sense as a business. It may make more sense simply as a fun thing that you enjoy, where the entry fees defray some of your costs. As a business, you've made $100 in profits over two months while ignoring the cost of your own time, which includes hosting the game sessions themselves as well as all the time you spend promoting them and recruiting and screening attendees. If you're doing this on a larger scale then you'll also probably want liability insurance. And a larger scale also probably means it's not always you who's personally running the game nights and doing the screenings, so you'll need to pay somebody. Even if it's just you, you should include your own notional \"salary\" in your figures in order to be realistic and not fool yourself - your time is not free. Try to estimate how much you're ultimately earning per hour of effort, after considering all your costs.\n\nTo make this work, I think you need to find ways to get more income per session. $5/person seems really low. Maybe buy games at wholesale and sell physical copies during sessions at retail prices: people like instant gratification. Sell game-related T-shirts and merch. Charge a small fee to indie game companies for including/promoting their games at your sessions. Create a newsletter or social media account for the group with affiliate links to where people can purchase the games that they played, so you earn a commission. Strike a deal with a bar or restaurant to get some percentage of the tab or a flat fee if your session brings in a minimum number of extra people on a normally slow day. Offer a membership option for something like $15/month as an alternative to paying as you go - many people are lazy and will sign up but then come rarely/never.",

It has been going for 13 years. I would be worried at some point a few of your attendees will swap contact info and say, \"hey, let's just start meeting at X and skip the entrance fee\". I recommend introducing at least one new game a month. Keep a real close eye on BGG's lists to stay current on your game selection. This might keep people coming back. All the game stores in my area have free weekly game nights, and game libraries ranging from 10s to 100s. So you need to determine what sets your paid event apart and better than the alternatives.\n\n20s is the wrong demographic IMO. I've been to boardgame conventions and boardgame meetups. The age demographic is more like 35 to 65. I'm guessing about 75% male to female. Also, college kids are pretty savvy using social media to coordinate and would also quickly recognize they don't need to pay someone to play a game. \n\nIf you are a really good story teller or theater geek, I recommend you look into Blood on the Clocktower and start hosting BotC events. If you get really good, people would definitely pay to attend and most would be regulars. But it doesn't scale well. 10 people at $10 each for 3 hours is not really worth it unless you love it.",

The fact that you screen people is already a step above public events.\n\nIt sounds like you could lean on the 'club' angle even though you are operating in public spaces now. This wouldn't feel very club-like or exclusive. For that you would need to think about paid venues, starting small like finding cafes or restaurants in their off hours and seeing what deals you can do.\n\nHaving a new mystery location could be part of the fun but it would take a lot of effort to continually do this. But it could be done on rotation basis, adding more venues as you find them. \n\nNext is turning the event into more of an event. Making it more enticing, enough for people to get out of the house, maybe bring some of their friends and plan for it instead of taking it for granted.\n\nIf every games day/night is the same old, people are going to think they can always go to another event. This is how I feel about a friend's regular games day.\n\nI don't know what could be done or what is feasible. I mentioned planning food but this is very high effort, but could be done in conjunction with venues you find. \n\nFast forward a bit - you now have a few reasonably sized restaurants or cafes who let you use their space in exchange for buying food. Now you can do a rotation so each event is different and people who miss out can eventually 'try' it. \n\nYou can combine the above with additional themes, dressing up/cosplay, specific games, awards and prizes, etc to make each event even more enticing. \n\nUltimately you want to target people who have money to spend. They can already buy whatever they want, but they can't buy an experience off the shelf. Find and target these people within the gaming demographic if you want to scale.",

My initial thought was that it seems like something that is very niche for wealthy families that will pay a premium price to get sure their house is in order and taken care of. Scaling this would not be the right move in my opinion. \n\nScaling would require extensive training, background checks, accountability, etc over the long-term. One wrong hire and your credibility is gone. You’d also have to find a whole lot more people justify the cost of adding staff. Payroll taxes, benefits, supplies, etc are just the starting point.\n\nIf you keep it small and boutique, but high touch, hospitality-focused and really provide the experience a customer is looking for, you can charge whatever you want. Wealthy people pay for their time and stress to be lowered. They’ll pay much more than you think. If you can give them their time back (10 hours per week for example) what is that worth to them? If they make $500/hr and you charge $250/hr, win-win. \n\nYou HAVE to focus on the trust and experience. This two will make or break the business.",

Regulations: particularly important is square footage per student and teacher to student counts as they relate to classroom size. You also want to look at bathroom rules.  For instance our classes are set up where we have the exact square footage for a teacher and an aide to operate with the legal student numbers. We have in classroom bathrooms that allows the aide to handle that while the teacher continues.  We have a floating teacher that does enrichment that lets the mainline teachers take a lunch break. In other words you want to maximize labor to student counts while maintaining a good product. This stuff is so decisive we had an offer for free use of a building that we declined because the room sizes and bathroom locations made it a nightmare on labor to effectively staff it\n\n2. Security: Prior to Uvalde we had a dozen police officers who we gave tuition discounts to in exchange for working pick up and drop off. Since Uvalde we have an armed officer on campus at any time students are there.  Parents want to feel their kids are safe. Off duty cops make $45-$55 an hour in our area. If it doesn't have a camera system better set aside the money to put one in. \n\n3. Competition: Does the school district offer free pre k and kinder? If so you better deliver a high quality preschool rather than a day care or you are limited to very young kids who are more labor intensive.  Also be aware that many churches use preschool and daycare to both draw in new members and absorb building overhead costs but don't expect them to pay off the mortgage on a building or generate a profit. In both cases you may have legacy competition with essentially free real estate\n\n4. What sort of state funding is available for tuition and how bureaucratic is that system? If you go that route you may have a significant staff chasing reimbursement payments.\n\n5. Who is your customer and are you convenient? We specialize as the high end pre school. We are around the corner from the high end elementary magnet elementary school so multi kid parents aren't trying to drive across town.  As a result we have a very geographically diverse student body. Other schools mostly grab from either the residential neighborhoods near them or in the case of the downtown ones the employers near them.\n\n6. What's the vaccine policy? Highly polarizing issue that will cause parents to not consider you or leave when you choose one or the other.\n\nBig piece of due diligence I'd ask for is their file from the state regulators.",

Also notice how I say teacher and not staff. You will likely have staff who won't be with kids so they can't count towards the teacher:kid ratio.\n\nLet's say the state mandates 1 teacher for every 7 students. You should absolutely strive to be better than that, let's say 1:5. This allows you to have teachers call in sick and still be in compliance with the ratio set by law.",

It still can take months depending on what state you’re in. \n\nWith aggressive marketing, and good staff it is possible to be close to capacity in 12 months. At least it was in my market. \n\nMany centers that own the building have it setup as 2 separate businesses. The childcare operation pays rent to the business entity that owns the building. This also can offer your real estate holdings a little extra protection if your childcare operation were ever to be sued. \n\nIt’s a difficult industry. Quality labor is extremely hard to get unless you want to pay above market wages. As someone posted already, it’s hard to find ways to reduce your overhead due to the required ratios being very labor dependent. \n\nLonger term the industry is ripe for government intervention. I have yet to see a real solution to the childcare crisis proposed and executed. My personal feeling is the future will see more school districts getting into the early childhood game more and more. This will erode the customers looking for care. There will always be a need for infant care, but infant care really isn’t very profitable, it’s more or less a pipeline to keep your classrooms full.",

Be open when people need to buy things...i.e. - after 5 or 6 pm.  Most people work 8 or 9 to 5 or 6 so they might need to stop by AFTER or BEFORE work to buy supplies.  Also SUNDAY.  I can't tell you how many times contractors need to buy some lumber before heading to their job, but the local lumber store doesn't open until 8 or they're closed at 5:30 or they aren't open Sunday or they close early on Saturday.  Hence, they go to Home Fart-hole, which them becomes the default because they can't rely on the local store to be open.  Also, management needs to be THERE all the time.  No management = terrible customer service, stealing, embezzling, etc.  And competent management is vital, too.  If you don't know how to manage, get out of the way.  Pump up the fact you're a LOCAL business, FAMILY run and owned!!  So many people would love to avoid Home Crapo.  Or Lowes (quality).   Etc.  If you can offer something that your competition can't, or won't, do it!  I know people that go to Les Schwab (ewwwwwww!) for their free popcorn!!!  Seriously.  If there's a special service or product line or something that sets you apart, try it!  Maybe a store kitty!  or doggo!  Or you'll load their lumber for them!  Whatever, just think about adding extra 'something'.  Pair with a local restaurant and offer free burritos or.....  I do wish you good luck and I hope you can make it work.

Right now interest rates are at an all time high. So people who finance home construction/renovation are just not doing it right now. This is prolly 90% of your audience. People who pay cash for home construction/renovation are likely not messing with small local lumber yards.\n\nAlso, the economy in general is super crappy right now. I build websites for small businesses. I'm finding that in general all of my clients across multiple industry segments have 20-50% lower web traffic this year when compared to last year. This directly translates into fewer phone calls and as a result lower income. All of my contractor/construction clients have canceled their websites this year. So I think this is your audience.\n\nWithout knowing exactly where you are, I would suspect a substantial portion of your historic clientele either own a small business or are directly employed by one.\n\nHere's my advice, your family has likely spent decades building relationships with your community. Just because they're not spending money right now doesn't mean they wont when the interest rates come back down. Which let's be honest will happen when Powell is replaced in May. This year's gonna be rough for you, but if you can find a way to cut costs and hold on, eventually there will be a recovery, and if you have decades of history with your community you'll be at the forefront of the local recovery.

I noticed how many students needed phone and laptop repairs and decided to start fixing devices myself cracked screens, dead phones, struggling laptops, whatever people brought in.\n\nThat small side idea slowly turned into a real business. Over time, we expanded into full electronics repair: phones, laptops, tablets, and more. What began as word-of-mouth work locally has grown into what it is today.\n\nToday we are in the US and also have a branch in the UK, was advised by a friend to replicate while he manages. Even with growth, we’ve focused on keeping repair quality and customer trust consistent across locations.\n\nNow I’m looking ahead and trying to figure out how to scale further without losing what made it work in the first place. For those who’ve grown service-based businesses:\n\n* How do you scale while maintaining quality?\n* Is franchising a good move for repair businesses?\n* What systems or processes matter most at this stage?\n\nWould love to hear lessons learned or mistakes to avoid.

The moment quality depends on “this tech just knows how we do things,” you’re capped.\n\nA few things that usually matter most at this stage:\n• Defining what “good repair” actually means in measurable terms (checklists, tolerances, time-to-resolution, post-repair testing)\n• Locking down intake + diagnosis so every location solves the same problem the same way\n• Training for judgment, not just steps — why certain repairs get declined, refunded, or escalated\n\nFranchising can work in repair, but only once the above is boringly documented. Otherwise you end up franchising inconsistency.\n\nThe businesses I’ve seen do this well obsess less over growth tactics and more over making the best location impossible to mess up.",

A few months later we follow up to see if he wants to leave it on hold or cancel the order, but we can't get reach him. A couple more months go by and the customer is reaching out wanting to cancel.\n\nI told him we can absolutely get the order cancelled, but we're only going to refund his deposit if his permit was denied due to issues outside of his control (the contract he signed is an older contract and states everything is non refundable unless the permit is denied and he is unable to remedy the situation). I told him if it's anything other than the permit being denied, then we can cancel it and give him in store credit for what he's already paid.\n\nI'm going to have to call this guy on Monday and tell him we're not giving him his money back, and whilst I don't necessarily feel bad about it due to how long it's been, the inability to reach him, failure to provide an explanation, etc, I do still feel some anxiety with actually having to tell him.

It's VERY tough to get into this market without buying an existing stand.\n\nBusiness has been established since early 2000s and includes several refrigerated display cases, as well as everything needed to sell prepared goods.\n\nHere's the stumbling point:\n\n* It's run by a husband and wife team, they say they work 40 hours/week each.\n* They employ two part-time workers to food prep and sell food at the stand.\n* They employ a full-time baker.\n* The buyer has to provide their own commercial kitchen - the business has a separate kitchen that does not come with the business.\n* Net sales are 400k/year, net profit is $100k/year (they are optimistic about bringing that to $150k/year with wholesale/catering but haven't done it).\n\nThey want $320k for what appears to be $20k of assets plus a market stand, where the profits are about $50k/owner/year to work full-time and manage employees.\n\nI'm thinking that this should sell for closer to $150k - am I crazy or are they?\n\n",

The separate kitchen doesn't come with the business, but can a contract be put in place? What relevance is the full-time baker if they (presumably) work in the separate kitchen?\n\nIt sounds like the sellers are banking on an attractive location, established reputation, and \"could make\" $X level. You don't pay them for the incremental increase you have to pursue, so that last factor is irrelevant. My thoughts are the key, at least in the short term, is ensuring continuity of product availability and quality, particularly if you don't already have ovens or a third-party baker. Take a long, hard look at that part of the equation. Would your COGS be commensurate as what they were doing when they were, effectively, baking in-house?\n\nBeyond that, I would have to assume the location is a large part of the intangible value given retail bakers don't typically have much else that's readily long-lived and transferrable. And I'd get a sense of the sellers' intentions once they offload this location. If they're so good that they can forget this location and just start another near or at their bakery, and simply market themselves as \"We moved to...\" and undercut your prospective operations, then all you'd really be receiving is their stand at a historic location.",
