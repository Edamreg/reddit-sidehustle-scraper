I'm doing all the heavy lifting. She just puts the bottles in the bag. \n\nI came to find out that the recycling centre has bins they can drop on site and they also offer to empty them once a week. Booked the bins, booked the pick ups and now I'm set to collect basically free money. \n\nThe owners didn't seem bothered to know what I was doing and agreed to give me the next year's worth of recycling if I took care of things. \n\nI'm tempted to just call restaurants and hit them up for this scheme. \n\n\nHas anyone done this? It's nuts the owners of the restaurant are so lazy.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been trying to make money online for a while now, and honestly I’ve tested like 10 different things. Most of them either paid basically nothing or took forever to see any results. I kept jumping from idea to idea because everyone online makes it look so easy, but when you actually try it, it’s a whole different story. Being a student doesn’t help either, I barely have time and I’m always broke, so I needed something that actually works without a bunch of start-up costs.\nAfter trying all that stuff, only a few things ended up giving me real payouts. Making short little brand videos on Methods app has been surprisingly decent, I’m not some influencer or anything, but the beginner tasks still pay something. I also started putting simple digital templates on Etsy, and I sell small guides and checklists on Gumroad whenever I have time to make new ones. And when I need quick tiny cash, KashKick fills in the gaps, even if it’s not a lot. These aren’t huge money makers, but when you stack them together, it’s actually helped me get through the last couple months.\nI’m still learning and trying things though, because I kinda need every extra dollar I can get right now. If anyone else is also doing low-effort or beginner-friendly online stuff that pays even a little, I’d love to hear what’s been working for you. I’m really just trying to survive school without going completely broke lol.",

          "body": "I’ve found that profitable side hustles never come by googling the subject.  They come by shifting your perspective slightly.  Any time you see anyone advertising or doing anything.  Ask yourself, why are they doing that, how does that work, how hard is it to do that exact thing?  Talk to real people you know.  Chances are they like you and will tell you what they’re up to.  All those people living around you in a big city…they’re all making money…and it’s not just a full-time job.  Be observant.  And once people find a profitable side hustle, the last thing they want are copycats so they do not post it online.  But it does take imagination, brainpower and often learning new skills.  Just don’t let your brain hold you back.  Never let your brain tell you that you could never do that for whatever reason.  With all the free learning tools out there these days there’s literally nothing that you can’t figure out.  If you see an AD online that says ‘Make Money Easy Online’.  Don’t fall for it.  The person posting that AD is the only one making money.  You can try copying what they’re doing if you want.  But don’t buy what they’re trying to sell.",

Did that for 5 years. YouTube ad revenue sharing I got about $100 a month. If lucky maybe around $200. Some affiliate sales but that was really hard to get people to click on the link. YouTube videos every week or several a week is hard to maintain. Burnt out with it. In the end I just felt defeated. Not saying to give up or not try. If you want to go for it.

Things like cleaning services, pet care, or mobile car detailing can work really well in the UK market.. lower overhead than retail and you can often start small and scale up.\n\nThe property thing - yeah i get why you're hesitant there. But service businesses are different because you're not tied to expensive real estate. One thing I'd suggest is looking at businesses where you can test the concept first before going all in. Like if you're thinking about a cleaning franchise, maybe try running a small independent version for a few months to see if you even like managing crews and dealing with customers. That way your £10k goes toward actually validating the idea instead of just jumping in blind.",

      "selftext": "If you’re looking for a high-leverage side hustle in 2025, I genuinely think building a micro SaaS is the move. You don’t need VC money, a team, or years of coding experience anymore.\n\nHere’s the formula:\n\nFind a problem you’ve personally experienced, something annoying that costs you time or energy, and build a solution around that inside of Lovable. It’ll handle all the SaaS boilerplate for you, so you can focus on the actual product. Use Supabase for your backend and Stripe for payments. That’s your foundation sorted.\n\nNow when it comes to marketing, this is where most people go wrong. The first 30 days should be 100% organic. That looks like:\n\n1. Reddit posts that don’t feel like plugs. Ask questions or share your story in communities related to your niche. Don’t sell, just spark discussion.\n\n2. Reddit replies under competitor mentions. Add real value to existing threads; people will click through naturally.\n\n3. YouTube comment placements. Leave thoughtful comments under videos where your target users hang out.\n\n4. Short-form videos. Post simple slideshows or product demos daily on TikTok, Reels, and Shorts, like “top 5 controversial things I learnt about XYZ” \n\n5. AI UGC videos. Use an avatar or voiceover to share your product demo with a catchy hook like “Can’t believe this tool does X.”\n\n6. Green screen memes. “POV: you realised [pain your product solves]” it’s quick, relatable, viral.\n\n7. Standing avatar + wall of text. Static background, emotional or relatable text overlay; crazy watch time, easy to make.\n\nThese plays can bring your first 100 users without spending a cent on ads. Stack them daily, and you’ll start building real momentum fast.\n\nBtw you can run these marketing strategies inside something like Canva or Aftermark AI ",

Whether it be information, productized services, or ecommerce, I come across them all the time and love researching them until I have a solid understanding of what they cost to start, how they could potentially make money and the steps to get started. \n\nThing is, I'll never have the time to do them all, so they sit in a Notion doc that I update as I delve deeper and come across new ones. I'd love to share them with people, but I'm not sure 1,000 rows of unstructured notes would do anyone much good. \n\nSo I'm curious: if you could subscribe to a newsletter/podcast that shares new ideas in a short-form, easy-to-follow format, what would you like to see included? What would make the information valuable enough to share with other people? Once you have the idea you resonate with, what would stop you from getting started? ",

Ive never done it, but I have a buddy who lives near Chicago and he will go to chicago on the weekend, do door dash and make about 3 days worth of normal pay in two days AND he doesnt have to worry about gas cause he uses a bike to ride around orders.

          "body": "In today’s world, financial pressure on young adults is undeniable. The rising cost of education, housing, and general living expenses, combined with the desire for financial independence, has made a single source of income feel insufficient. Fortunately, the modern economy, powered by technology and connectivity, has opened up countless opportunities to earn extra money. For young adults, this \"side hustle\" culture isn't just a trend; it's a practical way to build savings, pay down debt, or simply afford a better quality of life. The methods available are vast, ranging from flexible app-based gigs to monetizing unique personal skills online.\nThe most accessible entry point for many is the gig economy. This term refers to the ecosystem of apps and platforms that connect workers directly with customers for short-term, on-demand jobs. Think of services like Uber and Lyft for ridesharing, or DoorDash, Instacart, and Uber Eats for food and grocery delivery. These jobs are popular for a reason: the barrier to entry is low, and the scheduling is incredibly flexible, allowing you to work around classes or another job. Beyond delivery, platforms like Rover and Wag connect animal lovers with pet-sitting and dog-walking gigs, while TaskRabbit allows you to get paid for helping people with moving, furniture assembly, or yard work. While this work provides immediate income, it can be inconsistent and is often tied to your location and the time you're willing to put in.\nFor those with specific digital skills, the world of online freelancing offers a path to higher-paying and more career-focused work. Young adults, often \"digital natives,\" are uniquely positioned to excel here. Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr have created global marketplaces where you can sell your talents. If you are a strong writer, you can get paid for writing blog posts, website copy, or social media updates. If you have an eye for design, you can create logos, social media graphics, or presentations for businesses. Other in-demand skills include video editing, programming, and even administrative tasks as a \"virtual assistant,\" helping busy professionals manage their email and schedules from afar. This route not only provides income but also builds a professional portfolio, which can be invaluable for your future career.\nIf you have a more entrepreneurial or creative spirit, you might explore the creator and e-commerce economy. This involves building a brand or business online. One popular path is e-commerce, which can be as simple as \"thrifting\" or finding unique clothing and reselling it on platforms like Depop, Poshmark, or eBay. If you are crafty, you can open an Etsy shop to sell handmade goods, art, or even digital products like resume templates, photo-editing presets, or planners. On the creator side, platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch allow you to build an audience around a passion, whether it's gaming, cooking, or education. While it is a slow process, a dedicated following can be monetized through ad revenue, brand sponsorships, and selling merchandise. This path requires patience and consistency, as you are building an asset, not just trading time for money.\nFinally, it’s important not to overlook the power of traditional, local services. Not every side hustle has to be high-tech. There is always a reliable demand for in-person skills. If you excel in a particular subject, academic or music tutoring is a classic and well-paying option. Babysitting and nannying remain in high demand, offering steady, reliable income. Other valuable local services include house cleaning, landscaping, car washing, or offering tech support to less tech-savvy neighbors, like helping seniors set up their smartphones or computers. These jobs often pay in cash and help you build a strong reputation within your community, leading to consistent work through word-of-mouth referrals.\nUltimately, the best method for earning extra money depends entirely on your personal skills, available time, and financial goals. The gig economy offers speed and flexibility, while freelancing builds a valuable portfolio. E-commerce and content creation provide a path to building your own brand, and local services offer reliable, community-based income. The key is to recognize that your time and skills have value. By exploring these options, you can move beyond relying on a single paycheck and take active control of your financial future.",

The actual work is fine, I can fix most things, but keeping track of invoicing and payments is getting out of control.\n\nI'm using venmo and cashapp for payments which seemed easy at first but now I can't keep track of who paid what. I’ve been trying to take a 50% deposit upfront, but not everyone is willing to. It’s hard to keep track, especially with some clients taking weeks to pay. Last month I completely forgot to invoice a customer, just totally spaced on it until they texted me asking for their invoice.\n\nAlso getting leads from nextdoor and facebook but half of them ghost after I send estimates. Takes me a day or two to respond usually because I'm at my day job. Had someone ask for a quote on replacing their deck boards last week, sent it that evening, they went with someone else the next morning.\n\nMy system right now is basically google sheets and hoping I remember everything, it's clearly not working anymore as I'm getting busier.\n\nWhat are you guys using to stay organized with this stuff?",

      "selftext": "Truth be told, building anything passive was never the grand plan. I just got so incredibly tired of having to start from absolute zero, every single time I tried something new.\n\nIt all began with this super simple habit. Whenever I made something that actually sold, I'd literally just remake it three different ways - new colors, different titles, tiny tweaks. I wasn't trying to be clever or strategic, I just, honestly, didn't want my shop to look completely empty. Then, a few weeks later, it hit me: those duplicate listings were ranking all on their own, quietly pulling in random sales while I was off doing, well, anything else.\n\nThe same phenomenon extended to Pinterest. I'd published a few pins, then promptly disregarded them, only to find them consistently driving traffic. Medium echoed this experience, an article composed long ago continued to accrue views. It became apparent: any content or asset that formed a connection to another element within my ecosystem maintained its efficacy without active management.\n\nRecognizing this, I intentionally cultivated these connections. Currently, my Etsy listings direct to my blog, which in turn links back to the shop, with Pinterest serving as a feeder for both. This isn't sophisticated, but it creates a continuous loop. Consequently, the system remains operational even during periods of disengagement.\n\nThis isn't the result of complex automation. Instead, it operates on a principle akin to 'digital gravity', initial momentum in one area organically attracts and propels related components, sustaining a continuous flow.\n\nMy former belief was that sustaining my hustle required perpetual motivation. The reality proved to be simpler: I merely needed to establish systems robust enough to function independently of my energy levels. Now, I frequently awaken to small sales, monitor traffic, and feel a sense of contentment knowing the underlying mechanics continue to operate discreetly.\n\n",

      "selftext": "My name is Tim. I’m from Hoofddorp, a small town next to Amsterdam. I work full-time as a teacher and I teach history at a primary school. Alongside my full-time job, I have always traded in domain names. I have successfully sold many domains, such as hond.nl, fietsenwinkel.nl and many more. For over twenty years, I’ve earned an extra monthly income this way. Sometimes I made €3,000, but usually between €1,000 and €1,500 per month by buying and selling domain names.\n\nHowever, the past year has been very disappointing because there are very few good names left with extensions like .com, .eu and .nl. I was actually thinking about quitting… until I had a conversation with a colleague who emigrated to Dubai. He told me that the .ae extension is becoming increasingly popular among locals and  many international companies due to tourism growth.\n\nEspecially in the real estate sector, .ae domains are used more and more to build trust when selling expensive villas. You can easily buy .com or .nl domains anywhere, which has led to a lot of scammers. A .ae domain, on the other hand, is harder to obtain and requires passport verification before the government approves the registration (you don´t need to have a pasport-ID from the emirates, you just need to have an ID and that´s it.. I live in the Netherlands and that´s also fine.\n\nSo I decided to give it a try. In the first weeks I invested €360, because through hosts like OnlyDomains you pay around €36 per year for a .ae domain. I immediately bought the domains palmjumeirahvillas.ae and palmjumeirahhotels.ae. Within a week I sold them simply by emailing real estate companies with an offer.\n\nIn the first month I earned €9,800, and the month after that €15,600. It continued like that for a while. Recently, I’ve noticed that competition is increasing and profits are slightly lower, so I started flipping: I bought domains I had previously owned again and resold them within a week with a 60% margin. In the end, I’ve now made €100,000 and I’m enjoying my time alongside my job even more.\n\nI hope young, driven entrepreneurs read this and find some motivation. There are so many opportunities as long as you think of a good idea and apply it to a niche that is rapidly growing. Follow the market! We can clearly see that the housing market in Dubai is extremely popular, so we respond to that.\n\nI wish you all a wonderful evening and lots of success.",

Almost every business today needs video content for marketing, whether it is Instagram reels, TikTok shorts, YouTube videos, or website promos. The demand is huge and growing.\n\nYou don’t need to be a filmmaker. You can learn basic editing in a week. The only part most beginners struggle with is doing voiceovers, but that problem is basically solved now because you can use AI voiceover tools and get clean, natural narration without recording anything yourself.\n\nOnce you know how to put together short promotional videos, product demos, before-and-after videos, or service explainers, you can sell monthly content bundles to small businesses. For example:\n\n10 short videos per month  \n2 long videos per month  \nA full video reel pack  \nSocial media formatted clips\n\nBusinesses love it because they need fresh content constantly, and you can deliver it quickly once you have a workflow. This skill is simple, fast to learn, and can become steady income because businesses often stay with you month after month.\n\nI also explain how to make voiceovers easily in my newsletter, link in my bio if you want more details.",

          "body": "I've been making a couple hundred each month just by looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than the cost. It's called bonus arbitrage. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

Some of my best passive income successes in the past have been from dipping my spoon into the broader market, but I’d be hesitant to lean into it right now given the number of states that are enacting ID laws for accessing porn sites, which might as well be a porn ban. Likewise, at this point, there’s very little to stop the Project 2025 vision of making porn illegal within the next year a reality, and I would not be at all surprised if any businesses considered to be abetting the distribution of pornography to be held liable as well.\n \nSo, ignoring any moral objections you may have, strictly in terms of what’s going to be best for your business over the next three years or more, I don’t think leaning into it is the way. Maybe ten years ago but not in this budding dystopia we’re rolling into. If it were me, I’d monitor them to make sure they aren’t promoting or fronting for some truly rancid stuff, but leaning towards cutting quick if their presence is providing little relative benefit or limiting growth. Meanwhile I’d be reviewing and updating terms and user agreements to course correct.",

Amazon warehouse employees are at least paid but treated horrendously and not allowed to take bathroom breaks. Most restaurants use undocumented labor for their kitchen staff, which is not bad in my opinion, but as a result they often pay less than minimum wage which is morally wrong. Unfortunately, I could go on forever. In fact, I don’t know if I can name an industry that is 100% morally sound. \n\nA lot of modern porn is actually not too bad in terms of ethics. Obviously there are certainly porn sites that are not morally sound at all and some that violate legality. But a lot of popular modern porn sites are not only ethical, but empowering for the content creators! I feel like porn faced heavy scrutiny in the 2010’s after the documentary ‘Hot Girls Wanted’ exposed how awful it was, and as a result it has been reformed for the better.  Only Fans and Fansly for example, allows their creators freedom/control over their content, work conditions, and a very equitable share of the generated profits! The top 10% of creators on those sites likely make 6 figures, have full creative control over what type of content they make, and are protected from workplace harassment. It also can be a safe space, and excellent platform for lgbtqia people to not only express their sexuality, but monetize if. \n\nAgain, I’m sure there are definitely porn sites that are unethical, but I would go out on a limb and say that currently, porn is the most ethical that it has ever been, and is far from the worst industry. I would feel much worse about being involved in the real estate broker/foreclosure, predatory/payday loan, or healthcare industries than porn.",

      "selftext": "Forget building elaborate automated systems. My actual goal was far simpler: I just wanted to stop micro-managing every single one of my side hustles.\n\nMy first foray into automation began with a basic reminder. I simply scheduled a weekly alert for Fridays to relist a handful of Etsy products that were losing visibility. This minimal effort, taking barely two minutes, proved surprisingly effective at preventing a significant drop in traffic.\n\nNext, I integrated auto-scheduling for Pinterest. I simply took my existing designs, configured them to loop every few weeks, and pushed them out. There was no specific optimization. Yet, these automatically recycled posts began generating a consistent flow of clicks.\n\nMy next step involved a more technical approach: I developed a simple script to programmatically reindex older blog pages via Google’s API. While it sounds complex, its primary purpose was to automate a task I disliked performing manually. Once confirmed operational, I promptly ceased thinking about it.\n\nThis pattern became a clear directive, every instance of successful automation stemmed from a reluctance to perform repetitive, unstimulating tasks manually.\n\nSo now, the Etsy listings just auto-renew, the pins repost themselves, the old pages get reindexed... and this little ecosystem just keeps generating a handful of random sales or clicks each week. It's never anything massive, but it totally adds up, enough for coffee, a nice little rent buffer, and honestly, a whole lot of peace of mind.\n\nEveryone out there talks about 'passive income' like it's this glorious, sprawling system you build once and then, boom, you retire to a beach. For me? It's way more like a messy pile of half-automated chores that just quietly chug along in the background while I'm off doing literally anything else.\n\nIt's undoubtedly chaotic, lacking any aesthetic appeal, and occasionally requires troubleshooting. Yet, its consistent contribution to my rent makes it entirely satisfactory.\n\n",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’ve been doing KDP since August of 2024, a little over a year now. I started with nothing. Literally. No money, living out of my car. I want to share my full experience scaling this from $0 to $150K revenue. The lessons I learned, and why I think KDP is nowhere near saturated as many claim.\n\nMy hope is that this post will give you value, motivation, and perspective, especially if you’re just starting out or feel stuck.\n\n# A Little Background\n\nI’ve always been into business, ever since i was a kid flipping Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh cards and other collectibles, plus video game currencies, items, accounts. Over the years I’ve tried everything: forex, stock trading, affiliate marketing, SEO blogs, crypto, dropshipping, customer acquisition/lead generation agency, CPA marketing, SMMA, POD, and of course KDP.\n\nJust to keep in mind, this is not my first time doing KDP. My first attempt was in 2019, but my account got banned in early 2020 for a few (frustrating) reasons:\n\n* I used a term, that a few months later got filled for trademark and Amazon flagged me, even tho the trademark was just pending and was rejected later.\n* Got hit with a “similar cover” strike ( I should have fought it, probably would have won. Not sure why I didn’t.)\n* Published a book called “Snarky Nurse Coloring Book” with the idea that the book was snarky (snarky quotes), not the nurse. Tt got reported by a brand called Snarky Nurse or something similar.\n\nAfter the third strike, Amazon didn’t let me appeal or explain myself, they kept sending the same generic response that the decision is final and nothing could be done.\n\nAfter all this I didn’t do anything, I got comfortable, had plenty in savings, some other life events happened during covid that I lost any motivation to do anything, until life forced me to start again.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nI’m not smart or special. Many people make much more with KDP than I do. But I’ve failed a lot and learned from my mistakes, and treated this like a real business. What I’ll share is what worked for me. Hopefully you’ll learn something useful from it and get some clarity on how you should approach this business.\n\n# Quick Stats:\n\n* Started: August 2024.\n* Books Published 148. (1 book every 3 days or so)\n* Total Revenue: \\~$150,000\n* Ad Spend: \\~$16,000\n* Employee Costs: \\~$24,000\n* Tools &amp; Subscriptions: \\~$2,500\n* TikTok Marketing Videos: \\~2,000\n* Profit (before tax): \\~100,000\n\nLast month, I made \\~$32,000 revenue, with \\~$10,000 expenses.\n\n# Lessons, Tests &amp; Observations:\n\n1. **Quality vs. Quantity.** I’ve seen many YouTubers talk about focusing only on quality and to be honest I don’t fully agree. I started with quantity, not because I believed in mass publishing, but because I wanted data. I uploaded many somewhat decent quality books at first (most didn’t even hit 10 sales) and they helped me to identify which niches and formats had potential. Then I moved to more medium quality books, they took me 2-5 days each, in niches that showed potential and these confirmed the winners. I then outsourced even better versions and that’s where most of my revenue came from (excluding the unicorn). So it’s not quality or quantity, you need both to optimize your business.\n2. **Amazon ads.** I’m a numbers guy, I love data, tracking, testing everything. With amazon ads you obviously get more sales, but you also get an 20-30% bump in the organic sales. Sales boost your BSR, help you rank higher, which gets you more sales, more reviews, and all of this combined, a stronger foundation in the algorithm, making it more difficult for competitors to outrank you. So yes, ads are worth it, even beyond direct ROI. There’s another reason why I find ads even more important than getting sales. To be honest I didn’t even start them with the idea to make money from them directly. As I said, I love data, and amazon unfortunately shows you almost no valuable data at all. Running ads helps you a little bit as you can see the impressions you get, how many clicks you get and how many conversions, enough signal to see what’s working and what isn’t. It’s not ideal, but this is what we have to deal with when it comes to amazon.\n3. **Keywords.** Always use relevant keywords, leave fields if you don’t have anything relevant to add. I tested adding trending but not relevant keywords on a couple of books that had \\~20 sales a month each. Sales dropped to 4 and 6 the first month and 1 and 0 on the second month. Removing those irrelevant keywords didn’t restore the sales. Only running ads brought them back. Unrelated words hurt your relevance score, which can tank your book entirely\n4. **External ads.** I had some experimentation with meta ads, spend $600 and made \\~$450 above baseline over the next few months (sales doubled the month with the ads being run and slowly fell back to baseline). Still not enough data to fully judge, I’ll test this more, I need to spend at least $10,000 to have at least some opinion about this, and that’s what I’m going to do in the upcoming months.\n5. **A+ Content.** Almost always helps unless it’s really, really bad. I’ve tested many different layouts, worst ones had \\~10% increase in CVR, the best ones increased 80-150%, depending on the niche and design. Either way, it helps.\n6. **Cover Design (not just artsy, its psychology).** After niche selection, cover is the most important factor. People do judge a book by it’s cover If your design isn’t at least as good as top competitors in that niche, your book is gonna sink in the vast ocean that is Amazon. If you can afford it and your design skills aren’t great, I would suggest outsourcing covers to skilled designers. Still, do some of them yourself, to have a better understanding as not all of it is art, it’s more about the psychology of the customer, it is the pitch for your product. (Also the content of the book has to be good enough as well, because negative reviews can kill your book just as easily as bad cover, just a little slower).\n7. **Descriptions.** I’m not sure if I am just bad at writing them, but I never seen a big difference in CVR from it. The only thing that seems to matter in my experience is the formatting. The description still has to be informative and relevant to the book itself, but if it’s done in a big block of text it’s not gonna help. If it is formatted nicely, then I’ve seen 10-30% CVR improvements. The other thing that I’ve noticed is that having a relevant and informative description helps the book rank higher. It happened consistently enough to make me almost sure that Amazon’s algorithm rewards it.\n8. **Low Search Volume Niches (Small Margins Scale Big).** Pretty much every YouTube video I watched about KDP said to target niches that have high search volume of 1000+ at the minimum and ignore every one of them that get less. I often target niches other skip, even less than 500 searches per month. I care more about competitor strength and actual sales. If I feel I have a fighting chance against the competitor in that kind of niche, that has 100-200k BSR, then I’ll attack it. I get it, making books that are going to get 100-200 sales a month isn’t sexy, but over the year they make $1,200-$2,400, and ten, twenty, thirty, one hundred of these adds up to real income.\n9. **E-mail Lists.** These are great but I’ve only managed to make them work in two situations. In my unicorn niche, I built a list of 1,000+ via a variety of freebies. When I launched a supporting book with a release day discount, I emailed the list and got 200+ day one sales. I’m not saying that 20% of the email list converted, but even if 3-4% can create enough sales velocity to push the book up the rankings making it get even more sales and climb even higher up. Second, with my “client” brand (consumable books). We built the list by running promotional ads and in book freebies. After every weekly release, the email goes out and almost consistently gets 100 day one sales, some releases even get 200-300.\n10. **Short-Form Video Marketing.** One day I got bored and thought about trying out something new, I released a book in a very competitive niche(which means lot’s of interested people) and created a TikTok account to make videos for that book. After printing the book and recording a few videos, repurposing them, following trends, changing the hooks , etc., one video hit nearly 1m views. This led to over 2,000 sales in the first week after upload. Since then I’ve uploaded 250+ videos, hired other people to make videos for me and I’ve had a few other viral videos (not as bit as the original one tho).\n11. **Pricing.** Compete on the quality of your book rather than price, if your book is better than competitor’s, price it higher and position it as premium. Low price makes you look cheap, not “affordable”. The pricing is different depending on the niche and type of the book itself, so what I would recommend is to launch around the average competitor price, could be a little higher if you are confident in your book (that’s what I do), or price it just a little below the average. Monitor CVR, if it is solid, then increase the price by $1 and observe, if it gets too big of a hit, reverse the change if it doesn’t keep increasing the price. If the book ranks high, gets steady organic sales and reviews, push premium pricing.\n12. **99% of Gamblers Give Up Before They Hit it Big.** Okay, maybe not in gambling (please don’t). But in business? Mostly true. Most people give up right before they’ve learned enough both from theirs, and other people’s failures to make their business work. There’s plenty of money in almost every business. Imagine a gambler spinning the slots, after 30 failed spins, he hits jackpot. Business it’s similar, keep testing, keep learning, fail, tweak it, try again. Do that 30 times and on attempt 31 it suddenly looks like you “got lucky”(You didn’t. You just didn’t quit.) If you knew that you were 30 failures away from your dream, would you keep going?\n13. AI Tools as Assistants, Not Crutches Do not let AI do all the work for you. You won’t really learn what’s working and the quality will be subpar. People notice that the book was written by AI and leave negative reviews. Use it to brainstorm ideas, rough outlines, keyword ideas that you’re gonna validate, even sketch A+ layouts. Always double check the accuracy (AI likes to hallucinate) and IP. AI speeds you up, significantly, but it doesn’t do the job for you.\n14. **KDP plateau.** Plateaus do happen at every stage. I sat at a bit over $6,000 per month for a while, luckily for me it was a decent enough revenue to stay motivated. Some people, especially beginners, plateau at $0 per month, or they reach $500 in the first months, stall for a few months, assume “KDP is dead” and quit. It’s not. It’s just lag and learning. The move isn’t to quit, it’s to keep publishing and keep making small improvements. Eventually you’ll break out. Keep going, keep measuring, keep improving and then the compounding finally shows up.\n15. **Outsourcing and delegating.** All of this is going to depend on your budget and skill level. I hire people to go faster, not to disappear. I keep strategy, ads, research, final approval and hand off stuff like covers, interiors, basic edits, videos. I also do some books fully myself to keep improving and learning. At first you should do everything yourself, to learn as much as possible, to even know what to ask your employees to do, to be able to make SOPs for them. Eventually when you can no longer keep up with the amount of books you want to make, you start hiring. Track cost per title, have an idea on how fast the contractors work, how long it is going to take to make a book. Keep light PM Cadence, do weekly check-ins, have a QC checklist before anything goes live. Plan so that one person’s vacation doesn’t stall launches. Pay on time, give bonuses when earned, give specific feedback, promote your A-players.\n16. **Treat it like a real business and I mean REAL business.** KDP isn’t a lottery ticket, it’s a real publishing business. I budget, track unit economics and make decisions off numbers, not vibes. That means knowing your CTR/CVR, ACOS/TACOS, margin, payback time (how long till the book repays it’s investment), opportunity cost, LTV per title and more. Keep a simple P&amp;L, reinvest into ads, books, testing, learning. Write SOPs for contractors, kill or fix anything that doesn’t earn its shelf space. Manage your cashflow, plan for seasonality, keep runway for tests, don’t starve the winners. Be boringly safe on ToS/IP and make sure to set aside money for taxes. Real business = clear goals, clean and tight processes, consistent iteration.\n17. **You need action much more than you need information.** Most people don’t have a knowledge problem, they have a doing problem. You can binge every KDP video, read every post in KDP forums and still have $0 in royalties because you never uploaded anything. On top of that you’re gonna forget most of the stuff you watched either way if you do not try to implement it almost immediately. When and if you’ll start taking action, you’ll go back and start rewatching those videos again with context. Learn just enough to take action. By taking action you’ll learn the most. Half baked action beats perfect research because market teaches faster than any tutorial. Most importantly be consistent with your action, and consistently improve with it.\n\n# Key Takeaways\n\nKDP is not oversaturated. People said that it was already “too late” back in 2019 when I first started, and they’ll say the same in 2030. The real difference is how you treat KDP. Treat it like a real business. Track data. Build Systems. Reinvest Profits. TEST RELENTLESSLY. Be consistent and improve every week. Stagnation is death, and even to maintain you level, you have to keep evolving because the competition is. Plan your week. Every Sunday, I write down my tasks and deadlines. And I need to do them. No excuses. That habit alone kept me on track for 60-70 hours a week for over a year.\n\n# My Goals for the Future\n\nThis December my plan is to get to $100,000 - the coveted six figure month. I know it’s possible, because December sales can triple or quadruple.  \nBut my goals don’t stop here.\n\n**My next milestone for 2026:**  \n$1,000,000 in total revenue  \n$253k+ in December 2026 alone.  \nThe reason for that specific figure is that back in 2020 I spoke with someone who made $252K in December 2019 with a team consisting of her and her husband. I’m going to have a bigger team than that to try to hit this number, but let’s ignore that fact.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis year has been life-changing. I went from being broke and sleeping in my car to running a six figure publishing business. I don’t think that this was luck. It was consistency, constant improvement, and treating KDP like the serious business it is. If you’re reading this and were thinking about quitting. DON’T. Keep going, test things, learn from your data, stay disciplined. Do not think “What if it’s not going work out? What if I fail?”. Think “What if everything does work out?”.",

I have many questions for you, hope you'll take a bit if your precious time to answer my questions.\n\n1) For this one, it's not really for you but for those commenters that saying you're using AI or you gave vague answers. I need to push it at no 1 because I don't think those people will have energy to read my essay till the end. Well, if they read, so here :\n\nIt's funny and sad how you saw this long ass explanations that you can't fathom what they're talking about, but still want to leave something so that the OP can experience a tenth of your miserable life by commenting that they're using AI or focusing on their vague answer eventhough actually their answer is make sense eventhough not straighforward, if you can read comprehensively.\n\n2) Now back to the topic. Most of your points eg: using ads and outsorcing the books, I'd assume you start to use those when you hit with good enough revenue. May I know how you started getting your first sale? Did you list the books and then wish for the best or you use ads from the start? Is it possible to just list out our product and just wait until some people interested to buy it? Or we still need to do some promotion? How about initial review, did you applly that for your book or you let review grew organically?\n\n3) You have more than 100 books, may I know if all of those from the same niche or different ones? If different, do you separate to different pen names that suitable for those niches or combine it under the same pen name?\n\n4) What software /system / service that you use for creating the low and medium content, and also high content. Eg: for high content youd need software or something to rearrange the format to make as book is it?\n\n5) As for the pricing, how would you decide the price? Based on content, word counts or pages? Eg for price 14.99, is it must be within 100 pages (for low content) and like 30k words (for high content)? What's your standard in pricing?\n\n6) Do you focusing on physical books or also ebook /audiobook? If including ebook and audiobook, do you have plan to create your own website to sell those? I mean, you'd increase the margin or something right?\n\n7) Are all your books use ISBN from Amazon or you bought your own? Would you keep using amazon kdp for it's trafic and book logistic convenience or you might venture out for proper publication?\n\n8) What's your opinion on untapped niches? Do you think it's untapped for a reason aka low or no demand, or it's still undiscovered because it's combination of different niches so it's a hard for people who's copying what niche works to create their own opportunity?\n\nI really appreciate it if you could answer all my curiosities. I'm interested to start amazon KDP with too much ideas but too little time and courage kinda hold me back. But reading your post make me think that it's not impossible for me to just start. Thank you for your time.\n\nP/s : sorry if there's any grammar mistake or whatever some people gonna be picky about, English is not my first language.",

Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

          "body": "Absolutely. And it can be so simple, just following these 3 simple principles (this is how I do it):\n\n1. Dollar-cost averaging beats market timing - You invest the same amount regularly, regardless of market conditions. When prices are high, you buy fewer shares. When prices are low, you buy more. Over time, this averages out your purchase price and removes emotional decision-making.  \n  \n2. Low-cost index funds beat active management - Over 90% of active fund managers underperform the market over 15+ years (check the SPIVA scorecards yourself). Index funds track the entire market with fees around 0.1-0.3% annually instead of 1-2%+ for active funds. That difference compounds massively.  \n  \n3. Time in market beats timing the market - Historical data shows staying invested through crashes outperforms trying to predict them. The market has always recovered. Always.",

For the first month I targeted 20% of my deposit per day. If I profited anything more, then that’s a bonus at the end of the month. As the months went on I targeted a smaller percentage per day. \n\nI initially deposited $10 and at the end of the 12 months my account was standing on $924,66. This was just strictly based off what my targets were. There were a few days where I hit a stop loss but, keeping a simple risk strategy is going to be a key to success. \n\n\nWhere people end up messing up, is that they try to 5x their deposits within a day. Which doesn’t work. \n\nRather slow and steady, than try and rush to make a million overnight. ",

Don't know how this will work, but it's an idea.\n\nIn 2018, I helped do a journalism piece on modern slavery  for the show Ecologic on 99.5 WBAI Radio, NYC. I was researching for slavery in the palm oil industry, their enslavement  of people and environmental degradation from the plantations, but when you research,  you find other stuff. One of them was fake designer bags. They force slaves to make the bags with lead. The buyer slowly dies of lead poisoning because the dust is either inhaled,  absorbed through skin, or if you're a nail biter, through the mouth. The slaves can be children of hide and seek age. I had nightmares doing this story.\n\nSo, keeping stuff out of the landfill,  making designer goods cheap enough to compete with fakes, while helping the slaves and giving me pocket money  might be the answer to solve a horrific problem. Still learning how to do this , but there are bag flippers out there making a living. Might as well try.",

Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

          "body": "I have been using the Vibecode app for a bit, so here is a straight answer.\nVibecode is more than a UI mockup tool. It generates actual mobile apps using React Native and Expo under the hood, and you can run them on your phone, not just click through static screens.\nI built a small mobile MVP with it that had email based login, saved user data, simple logic like tracking streaks and progress, and a couple of external API calls with basic tracking. That was enough to share the app with real users and collect feedback. All of that was done inside Vibecode without opening a traditional code editor.\nFrom what I have seen, it does well when your app is fairly straightforward. Things like auth, basic CRUD, simple conditions, and a few APIs are very doable. When you start asking for more unusual or complex workflows, it takes more effort to get what you want, and it helps a lot if you already understand how apps and data flows work.\nSo to answer the original question in practical terms:\nYes, Vibecode can build a real, functional mobile app, not just a visual prototype. It is a solid option if you want to get an MVP on a phone quickly and see how users react. If the app grows and you need heavy custom logic or long term maintainability, you will probably end up refining the generated code or bringing in a more traditional setup later, but that is a next step, not a blocker for getting started.",

Backend logic, auth, APIs, analytics, all of it. It's not just UI mockups.\n\nI've built functioning dashboards, client portals, and tools with actual database operations and integrations. Launches fast. The only issue I have is that edge cases and hyper custom logic sometimes needs tweaking after the app generates it, but that's honestly expected... You're not locked into what it outputs though as you can export and edit if needed.\n\nFor an MVP? Really freakin' solid. You'll have something real in days. The question is whether you want to spend time customizing stuff after or if the initial build is 80% of what you need anyway. You can then use vibe coders like Claude or Gemini Pro (hell, even GPT5 is decent) to finish the rest. \n\nBiggest thing I'd say is, try it for your specific use case first. Some app ideas are perfect for AI builders, others need custom development. But you'll know pretty quick once you start building.\n\nHope that helps.",

Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements.

Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill.

          "body": "Bonus arbitrage is a decent side hustle that can make you an extra couple hundred each month. You look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

The part that used to be the most difficult, the voiceover, is now solved easily with AI voiceover tools, so you can generate clean narration without recording anything.\n\nYour computer becomes your production machine. You can offer monthly video bundles to local businesses, and many will pay because they always need fresh content.\n\nThis is far more profitable and realistic than trying to use your PC for mining.\n\nI also explain more in my blog posts.

Social media things, apps, or e-books seem to be posted often, but that’s not passive at all. Like if you make an app then you’re a literal developer. That’s a job. If you write a book then you’re a writer. If you’re a social media influencer then you’re an entertainer.  \n\nI would argue that just because something provides residual income doesn’t make it passive, and many things still require pretty significant upkeep even after they’re “launched.”  \n\nAs others have said, traditional investments like stocks, dividends, and CDs are truly the most passive thing I can think of, but that of course requires a nest egg of money to start with. \n\nThat being said, it’s much easier to make money from a regular job and then dump it into a stable dividend stock than it is to learn how to write a book or an app if you don’t have any experience with that sort of thing.",

Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them.

      "selftext": "so I want to share just an idea of mine for making money, this is just a theoretical idea, I did NOT test it and not sure if you really can make money with it, theoretically you should be able...\n\nI’m sure all of us get a lot of spam emails... a cousin from Nigeria that left you some big money, you're a winner of some kind of lottery, Bitcoin earning... and many of them... and all of these spam emails either want you to download something (never do not download) OR just want you to send them something, like photo of bank account, credit card... or other things.\n\nso my idea is related to those spam emails that expect from you some response with files/images...\n\nI like to call it \"spam a spammer\"\n\nso like steps to do:\n\n1. Create a totally new email account (gmail I think is the best, and never do NOT use your real email)\n2. Expose your email publicly, so like write your email on any kind of forum, blogs... everywhere... so main idea here is for spammer parsers to find your email and just include it in their spam list. Here you could focus on niche, like expose email just on money maker forums for example\n3. Find some affiliate network that offers Pay Per Download, so if someone will download via your affiliate link - you earn money\n4. Upload to that affiliate network a couple of files, like image/png, pdf... and most important give them a real name like Fullname Password front, Bank account statement... and so on... so like to look like a real one\n5. The most important... for your email create a vacation autoreply to all, and here just create a nice message but not like a vacation reply, but to look more real, like replying to a real email... so like thank you, I’m glad I finally won something bla bla... and like in the end attach all the links to the affiliate downloaded files... so like to mention, here are my password front photo... here is my bank statement... so main idea is for the spammer to really think that you believed him and you sent him back real info\n\n...and then just wait for results... I mean you could just forget about these emails... it will work automatically for you\n\nso again, this is just one of my theoretical ideas that I’m not even sure will work at all...\n\nmaybe here someone will want to try or maybe tried something before and wants to share thoughts on this...",

Their support page has no info at all and the support person I spoke to through email was completely useless.",

Ads, as you can see, are now live on the site and have been for about 10 days.\n\nSo far, the RPMs are abysmal, only getting around $4 session RPM. I was hoping for $10 but this seems a bit far fetched for now.\n\nThat said, RPMs should increase as Mediavine continues to optimize ad placement and I hopefully continue to increase traffic. \n\nI am in their lowest rev share tier (75%) right now and this can get as high as 90%. \n\nBut in order to hit those tiers, I will have to significantly increase traffic - and I have done a bad job at that this month.\n\nMonthly traffic is still at 31k sessions, so no increase since the last update. \n\nWith the desktop app and especially with ads, this is all about scaling traffic (assuming I retain the same share of tier 1 country visitors). \n\nFor November, the tool site will probably make around $300 with sales of the app and ads. Idea is to reinvest every cent the side project makes into linkbuilding and maybe a few YouTube sponsorships (for the desktop app) down the line. \n\nStarting this, I always knew that it would be a 10 year side project and that the first few years would be somewhat slow.\n\nBut with ads now live, I am more confident than ever that I'll eventually get this to $10k in monthly revenue!",

Would session RPM be roughly converted to page RPM by diving by average pages per session? So if your session RPM is $4, and users view 2 pages on average, your page RPM is $2? If they viewed 4 pages it would be $1, and so on? I run a tool based site as well (mine are image generators more for entertainment, not practical tools like yours, but I think on-site user behavior would still be similar). I’d love to compare numbers if you’re interested to see how our ad metrics compare.

          "body": "Okay. Long rant ahead.\n\nReal wealth is discretionary time. I’ve run my own solo consulting practice for 15 years and here’s the truth most people don’t want to admit.\n\nMost folks hand over their entire life for a paycheck they don’t even like. They stay in jobs that drain them. They stay in marriages that have been dead, sexless, miserable for years - or for the “sake of the children.” One day they’ll  leave once the kids are grown up. They call it “security” while trading away the only thing they can’t earn back.\n\nAnd the punchline is cruel. By the time they finally “can” live, they’ve forgotten how. By the time, its time to retire, 60-70% of your life is OVER. It's the third quarter and you’re exhausted.\n\nWorking for yourself isn’t magic. It’s ownership. Your own wins. Your own screwups. Your own failures. Your life. Most people aren’t trapped by their job. They’re trapped by their tolerance for misery.\n\nFreedom isn’t given. You take it. You build it. You protect it.\n\nThe real failure isn’t the bad job or the clueless boss. **It’s thinking too small**. People dream in inches then wonder why their life feels tight. You don’t escape the rat race by getting a laptop. You escape it by raising your expectations for your own life. You set standards for yourself beyond what anything thinks is normal or rational.\n\nAnd here’s the part nobody teaches. Most people who leave corporate end up with a worse boss. The boss is *you*. And you’re brutal. You don’t trust yourself. You overthink. You worry about being judged. You micromanage your own ambition into dust. You make lousy money.\n\nPeople want to *play* entrepreneur, not *be* one. They want the aesthetic. Not the accountability. Real entrepreneurship is boring, lonely, and occasionally humiliating. It’s also the only path where your life becomes yours.\n\nMost people don’t fail because they lack talent. They fail because they never commit to being the one on the hook.\n\nAnd **finally**. My personal belief. There has NEVER been an easier time in history to earn six figures, even multi six figures, on your own. There may NEVER be a moment like this, ever again. The opportunities are everywhere. The tools are cheap. The playing field is wide open. The barrier to entry is ZERO.\n\nMost people still won’t do it. Not because it’s impossible. But because they don’t believe in themselves enough to try - and they set goals WAY TOO SMALL!",

Getting told what to do by people who didn't even understand the problem, watching politics beat competence... it drains you in a way sleep can't fix.\n\nWhat changed my life was when I realized I wanted my energy to go somewhere that actually mattered to me. Building something of your own forces you to face fear, uncertainty, and responsibility but it also gives you back your self respect. You start waking up thinking, at least the pain you feel today is mine, not caused by someon else's ego.\n\nSo I sold my big houses, my Porsches to run my own mental health startup, It was not easy, it was so painful, I just launched it 6 months ago and start seeing customers subscribing to the app and I am trying to scale it to 10k. The cost of doing this was big, I lost friends, my money, my health, my friends but...I am doing what is meaningful by helping others with their mental health.",

The latter part I do not enjoy, it is hard for me to have certainty in my planning, I perpetually doubt and resent myself for poor decision making. So in the context of your post it may not even be about particular managers, but just the nature of management. I’m definitely harder on myself as my own superior than I was on other people being my boss",

Initially, I did feel exhilarated and like I was tasting the freedom that I think you're longing for. But it didn't take long for me to realize that I was ignorant about a lot of things and deluding myself into thinking that I had all the answers. I was the clueless one.\n\nMy life is great now, but there were several points along the way where I found myself wondering what life would have been like if a more humble me in the past would have asked different questions and looked more skeptically at the grass on both sides of the fence before jumping. Personally, I also needed a lot more therapy and maturity. Starting my own company nearly cost me my marriage and even my life.\n\nI hope you find the next step in your journey soon and that it's a peaceful transition. I don't think that it should have to be an either/or situation, Corporate vs freelance/small business owner. I think you can work in corporate America and still be happy. I also know from other entrepreneurs' stories that you can do your own thing and be utterly miserable. It might be time for you to make the leap, but I'd recommend honing your side hustle skills first and checking out what other opportunities are out there.",

I should walk away, after tax, with low/mid 9-figures.): \n\nAny of the Rich Dad/Poor Dad Series by Robert Kiyosaki: Great for mindset and understanding how money and business works.\n\nMultifamily Millionaire (vol 1 and 2) by Brandon Turner, et. al.  Great for understanding real estate and how it really works. \n\nThe Due Diligence Handbook for Commercial Real Estate by Brian Hennessey: Understanding what to look for in buying CRE. \n\nFamily Wealth by James E. Hughes, jr. How to deal with wealth over generations (yes, I know most of you are not at this point, but it's good to start with the mindset of \"I'm already wealthy and so I'll start acting and behaving in that manner now\"). \n\nThe 10X Rule by Grant Cardone. Mindset and focus (yes, I know Cardone is either loved or hated. I feel neither way towards him. I'd never invest with him in his real estate ventures, but there are lessons in this book).\n\nThe encyclopedia of Real Estate Advice by Terry Painter: Understanding better how real estate and works and why it's important to buy assets and not liabilities.\n\nThe Internet of Money by Andreas M. Antonopoulos. Read the entire series. It's eye opening.\n\nThe Big Print by Lawrence Lepard. Truly understand the shell game that is money. Once you understand it and realize that you are NOT going to change the game, you can focus on profiting from the game (the game you can not change).\n\nThe Almanack of Naval Ravikant by Eric Jorgenson. Great insights!\n\n\n\"Relentless\" and \"Winning\" by Tim Grover. Serious motivation on what it takes to succeed at a high level. I relisten to these at least every year or two.\n\nThe Creative Dealmaker by Carl Allen. How to do 'buy and build' businesses.

Whether you're an Angel or seeking Angel money, you need to understand the game.\n\nThe Power Law by Sebastian Mallaby: Again, understanding the game of angel, VC and PE. \n\nHigh Output Management by Andy Grove. High level stuff, but worth a read so you can understand what your COO/Operations person is doing and how to build a great team.\n\nThe Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz: Just read it.\n\nThe Path Between the Seas by David McCullough. Why would I recommend a story about the building of the Panama Canal? Because it's one the best books I've ever read and it's filled with life and business lessons. Plus, no matter how bad you think you've got it...no matter how difficult your problems seem...they are NOTHING compared to what these men (and women) went through to make engineering marvel become a reality.\n\nTitan by Ron Chernow: Biography of Rockefeller. So worth the read.\n\nMellon by David Canadine. One of the greatest men of the gilded age...whether you like him or now.\n\nThe Power Broker by Robert Caro: If you want to understand how politics works...if you want to understand the two pillars that drive everything in the world (Power and Money)...then read this book. It may be the best book I've ever read.\n\nThe LBJ biography series by Robert Caro. The BEST biographical series I've ever read. LBJ was Caro's hero. As Caro learned...never meet your hero. LBJ is (IMHO) the greatest politician in the history of America. And I say that as someone who things he's one of the worst presidents ever.

I was listening to a podcast (dont remember who) years ago and this woman name Dr Carol Robin created a successful course called touchy feely that helps people develop better communication and leadership skills. She wrote a book on it called Connect and said she hopes it sells well but wasnt sure because you can't just read the book and develop those skills. It ended up not selling well based on the number of Amazon reviews and you really need to be in a classroom with a bunch of people to talk to for it to work. \n\n\nI'm not saying books are a waste of time but people really need to apply themselves with what the book teaches which can usually involve a lot more work than people want to do. I actually think there's probably a lot of good YouTube channels that can help people succeed but its hard to filter through them to find the good ones. Some of them are actually successful and some only talk about being successful hoping their YouTube channel will take off so they can sell courses on how they did it or something lol. ",

      "selftext": "It's a dumb question. You're not dumb, just maybe uninformed, which I will rectify shortly. But the question is very, very dumb.\n\nFirst off, people who ask \"what business should I start?\" are really asking \"how can I make a lot of money?\"\n\nStraight up, starting a business is a crappy way to make a lot of money. Statistically most people lose money. You're probably going to lose money. So, if you want to make a lot of money, get into management consulting or ibanking, which generally means getting an MBA. Have fun with that.\n\nSecondly, people who ask \"what business should I start?\" generally think that businesses are fungible, which means they're a commodity or easily swapped out with one another. This, btw, is why most businesses fail. Because people think that businesses are just this thing that you start and money comes out the other end.\n\nIf I said a great business is rolling up a bunch of dentist practices, would you know what to do with that? Like, do you have dentistry experience? Do you have PE experience rolling up companies? If the answer is no to both, don't fucking roll up a bunch of dentist practices. It requires skills you don't have.\n\nIf I said, \"ooh! ooh! ooh! AI, baby! AI is gonna change everything,\" are you especially good at AI? If you're not, then one school of thought would say that AI is a growing market, so you should learn AI and sell those services to other people. There's another school of thought that says every fucking person and their grandmother is learning AI right now so they can sell  services to other people and I really wonder what you are going to discover about AI that's going to make you better than my grandma.\n\nLastly, markets aren't interchangeable either.\n\nI spent nearly 30 years starting tech companies. Had a few successes and a bunch of failures. Now, I'm a world-class startup coach. I do that job exceptionally well, I have great word of mouth, make a lot of money. And when I started, I knew A LOT of people in several startup ecosystems. My access to that market helped me get off the ground and eventually scale this business.\n\nIf I decided to start a company selling shit to celebrities, I would fail. I would 100% fail. Why? I don't know any celebrities. I don't have access to that market and I'd probably run out of money and time before I figured out how to get celebrities' attention.\n\nStop asking what business you should start. They aren't lego bricks.\n\nHere's a much better question to ask yourself: what do I love to do?\n\nFind something you love to do. Get good at it. Prove that you're good at it by selling your services to other people, either as an employee or a contractor. Get promoted and get a great title. Or become a consultant, which is just a contractor who charges a shit ton of money.\n\nGet so good at what you love that you know things about your job and market that no one else knows about. Understand secrets about your industry that give you a fundamentally unfair advantage over everyone else. Even my grandmother.\n\nThen go start a business using that knowledge. That's the business you should start.\n\nEDIT: random spelling and grammatical errors. I type for shit.",

          "body": "I disagree. \n\nYou are speaking from the perspective of someone who has been in business for decades, but most of the people who ask these questions have never built their own thing. They might have fantasized about it, but they are either still in school or are shackled by a 9 to 5.\n\n  \nStarting a business is really hard. It is scary, risky, and almost everyone you know with a 9 to 5 will deride you for the decision.\n\nAnd one of the ways to make the journey easier is to build a community around you where you feel supported and advised.\n\nSo, when I see someone ask, \"What should I start?\", I am seeing someone who is scared to take the plunge and is trying to dip their toe. I see someone who is trying to diffuse their risk by asking for advice from more seasoned individuals.\n\nThat said, my main gripes are:\n\n1. I don't mind you asking, but I do mind you failing to execute on it. At the end of the day, you just have to take the leap, especially if you are still starting out. \n\n2. It is okay to ask for advice, but at the end of the day, you have to make up your own mind, and if you fail, you can't blame anyone else but yourself. In other words, don't start a business because others told you to, start it because you believe in it.\n\n3. Building a business is a marathon, not a sprint. There are no shortcuts, no viral hacks, and no expert tactics to help you leapfrog the competition. You need to put in a ton of elbow grease and understand that the best quality you can have is grit.\n\nSo, my perspective is ask for advice but then do something about it.",

What broke me out of it wasn't finding the \"perfect\" opportunity, it was realizing I was using research as an excuse to avoid starting anything real.\n\n\n\nHere's the thing about those markets being \"oversaturated\" - that's usually code for \"competitive but still profitable if you're actually good at it.\" I spent 2 years convincing myself everything was too crowded while sitting on my couch doing nothing. The people making real money aren't worried about saturation because they're focused on execution, not excuses.\n\n\n\nStart with something you can begin this week, not next month. Pick ONE thing from your list (I'd personally go with running ads since it's skill-based and businesses always need it) and commit to landing your first client within 30 days. Don't worry about scaling to 10k yet, worry about proving you can deliver results for one person. Most people never make it past the first client because they're too busy planning their empire instead of doing the boring work of getting good at something.\n\n\n\nThe corporate ladder isn't going anywhere if you need to fall back on it, but you'll never know what you're capable of if you keep researching instead of executing.

You’re just early enough to be seeing the highlight reels of people who’ve been grinding for years and mistaking that for everyone’s doing it but me. Trust me, most of those 10k/month people you see online either, already had skills, already had money, or they conveniently don’t show you the 18 months they made nothing.\n\nabout the everything feels saturated thing, you’re not wrong. A lot of these spaces are saturated because people jump in blindly, copy whatever a guru says, and expect money to fall out of the sky. That’s why most fail.\n\nI’ll tell you what I tell anyone I’ve worked with, online income isn’t hard because the business models are bad. It’s hard because people underestimate the skill part. You mentioned ads which is a perfect example. Ads used to be a cheat code. If you run ads before building trust, you’re basically burning money. People don’t buy because they saw your ad. They buy because they trust the person behind the ad.\n\nI’ve seen people throw 500- 2k into ads with zero return because the foundation wasn’t there. Same with ecom, with digital products and with high ticket offers.\n\nEvery single model requires, knowing how to build a brand, knowing how to market without being annoying, learning how to create demand, learning how to communicate value, consistency and actual patience\n\nNobody wants to talk about those parts because they’re not lavish\n\nAnd yes, start while you’re still working. Anyone telling you to quit your job and go all in is setting you up to panicbuild instead of grow. Your job buys you time, reduces pressure, and lets you actually learn instead of chasing quick wins.\n\nIf I were starting at 20 again, I’d pick one model that actually aligns with my strengths, get the right education around it (whether through paid programs or months of deep research), and treat the first 6 months as skill building not income chasing. Real money comes once you stop trying to get rich fast and actually learn how the machine works.\n\nIf you want to talk specifics or narrow down what fits you, I don’t mind helping, been in the space a while and I’ve seen what actually works versus what just looks good on social media",

But what I can say starting was probably the second hardest thing and laying down the foundations. But like many in the sub and everywhere you will read and watch business is about testing and speed. If you get an idea just take action and test if it works and makes you some money. Yeah you have to give it time to see if it works but the steps for every model for the online space are almost the same. Not to be general and cliche the steps are get an idea, build a website or mvp with a waiting list or form, market your idea either social media organic or running ads to that website, and track absolutely everything. Scrolls, clicks, all the data you can gather collect it because later it will be useful. But yeah that’s the jist of things.

Pick one that you want to learn and will stay motivated to improve in.\n\nThen decide how you can offer value to others in that field. Work with people in the industry. Take on positions where you work for cheap or free to learn the trade.\n\nI know this sounds crazy but a \"boring corporate job\" is an excellent place to learn and gain experience.\n\nWorking hard in my corporate job is what gave me the skills to go independent.

But the best parts have been that I've done so many things I was once afraid of doing, cold emailing people, randomly messaging people to ask for advice from strangers, asking for more help, learning to see the bigger picture, understanding that money is in abundance even if it's not in abundance in my bank account yet, but I've learned better mindsets. I've gotten so many rejections that right now it almost doesn't phase me. I mean it hurts but my mind is all about going all to keep exploring and experimenting and seeing what works and what won't work. Like I'm going beyond my limits. Not having enough money is also scary as hell! I've learned more about human psychology, marketing is more about showing than telling. You'll almost never be sure many times, but just go for it. I've read some incredible books that have also helped me out. One I am reading now is called Sprint by [Jake Knapp](https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb/collections/author-books-by-jake-knapp), another that I read was The E-Myth Revisited, why most small businesses fail and why others don't. Something like that. I began seeing revenue by my 2nd month in operation. It was slow but I learned to document what was working on Notion, parts of the work I disliked and what I could do better.

          "body": "It is very difficult. We hear those amazing stories about successful entrepreneurs. The truth is that they struggled at first. If you have a large budget, it may be easier; you can advertise early, but it may also be a problem because advertising won't work if you build the wrong offer.  \nMarketing in a world drowned in AI content is a challenge; how do you get visible.   \n  \nMultitasking: same here. With a budget you can hire, without you have to do everything, and it is extremely challenging. No matter if you have a team or do it as a solopreneur, execution remains critical; the wrong offer or the wrong execution, and you will fail.   \nSo, I am building my second startup, a community of SME experts that can help startups or anyone looking to build business-related skills.   \n  \nWe are very new, and every day, we are going through all those challenges, but we won't give up. We strongly believe we have something strong because it is built on what our potential users want.  So start there, connect with people, talk about your offer, and learn even before building if you can; it will save you time and mistakes. I hope this is helpful.",

It opens your mind the the most important aspect of business which is get a customer and get them to pay. Nothing else matters if you have 0 sales. Once you witness the full process of sales it expands how you think about business systems. 2. Start something incredibly simple to get a grasp of all the functions. Sales , marketing, operations, finance, opening an LLC, accounting and tax. You get a taste of how all this stuff works. You can do it on the weekend. Like junk removal or auto detailing. Simple businesses you can start with $1000 or less to get experience. Then jump into a high leverage opportunity once you have clarity from action. Clarity comes from action not thinking or watching youtube videos. In my opinion the perfect simple service business for you to start would be test prep or tutoring. Lets say you were really good at preparing for test prep. Go tape 50 signs around campus saying, \"Test prep $40 off and guaranteed 20% improvement on test scores with 4 session minimum\".

It would be built as a blockchain and integrate existing banks but primarily be a way for small towns to create their own mini-banks (issuance can be in whatever denomination people in that region use, backed by gold and other limited supply commodities). Creating speculative assets would not be a core feature of this infrastructure and standard debt-based approaches would also not exist as primitives on this system. Things like home financing is done based on local reputation scores and would require demonstration of value-added projects to the community. \n\nI'd lobby governments and municipalities into making sure that is all above board. Governance gets bootstrapped by the org itself initially but is eventually relinquished to the community members after an incubation period. My org must not retain any benefit (at all) from these communities creating their own financial infrastructure. \n\nI'd fund local and productive initiatives in exchange for minimal equity in said initiatives (commodity production, useful services, skilled labor education, etc..).\n\nMy time would be spent travelling to these communities with my family and team.",

They think it is a shortcut to freedom when it is actually a long road of pressure, discipline, and constant problem solving.\n\nSome people are not meant to be entrepreneurs, sure. But some people are capable, they just never built the habits, the patience, or the mindset to survive the tough parts. They jump in expecting excitement, not responsibility.\n\nSo for me, it is not about whether people should or should not start a business. It is about whether they are willing to grow into the person who can handle one.\n\nNot everyone wants that. Not everyone needs that. And there is nothing wrong with choosing a different path.",

In Lebanon, for example, we have a different mindset. It’s actually a bit embarrassing to say you are an employee. Especially if you are older. Why? Because an employee in Lebanon is either working for a wealthy family, or the government. And so people just assume he or she ‘serves’. (Of course; judges and generals are highly respected.) \n\nAnd how about employment in Eastern Europe? There it is shameful not to work. And people don’t understand the idea of being an independent businessman. I own cash flowing assets in Eastern Europe and I build to sell in Lebanon. So I think I’m doing fine. And yet, people in Eastern Europe still think that I am an unemployed person who doesn’t contribute to their economy 😂 \n\nAnyway, I agree with you. Not everyone should be a businessman or businesswoman. But I think it’s much more thrilling, exciting, and rewarding to be able to build your own business and pass it down to your children.

I met him through FB when he messaged me after I posted some Google Business Results from another client of mine, and after some talking back and forth, he agreed he wanted to give it a go. Things were great, rankings were moving, client was very responsive. Essentially, everything I could ask for until eventually he decided to go against my word in favor of a buddy he knows. Whatever right it's his business, but this eventually became a constant theme and would leak over into our work. Before you know it, these \"Suggestions\" his buddy was making would move our rankings from number 2 in the map pack generating 50-60 calls a month down into the top 5 where calls were still good but nowhere near the same, and you could feel there was no bottom/end to this until eventually he fired me when I refused some of the vital changes he wanted.\n\nI didn't take it to heart, aside from the friend stuff he was a good guy so we parted ways but I guess things continued to drop in ranking once I left. Now fast forward to a few months out and I guess he's convinced himself that I'm doing voodoo black hat magic against his business. Like I said interesting scenario but I can asssure you I'm not tampering or doing anything and it actually pisses me off a little that he would assume that, considering my only goal in the first place was to help him out and I even gave that little rat a discount when he first signed. I'm a little heated but what do you think the best way to tell him to F\\*\\*\\* off is without escalating this any further?",

Cease all informal contact.\n* **Demand Absolute Specificity:** Require a comprehensive and formal submission detailing their claims, including:\n   * A detailed, itemized list of all alleged grievances.\n   * A precise monetary value assigned to each alleged damage, supported by a thorough justification of how that value was calculated.\n   * A complete list of any and all potential witnesses, including their full contact information.\n   * Certified copies of any and all documentation they believe substantiates their claim.\n\n**The Strategy:** The endless requests for documentation and strict adherence to arbitrary procedures are designed to exhaust their energy and motivation. This isn't about winning an argument; it's about making the process so arduous that they give up.\n\n**Your Demeanor:** Your calm, composed, and detached tone is your greatest asset. It subconsciously de-escalates the situation. By refusing to engage in an emotional exchange, you control the entire dynamic of the interaction.\n\n**Advanced Tactics:** Invent your own internal \"policies\" for handling such disputes. For example: \"It is the policy of this respondent to require all financial claims to be substantiated by no fewer than two independent, certified appraisals.\"\n\nYou can also quote long, fabricated policy statements in your responses to further bog them down in procedural quicksand.

First, create a one form onboarding and one offboarding workflow that triggers procurement, IT provisioning, and an asset record being created or retired. Second, centralize a simple asset table with fields for owner, status, serial, issue date, and return date, and automate a nightly digest that flags missing or overdue devices. For tooling a lot of teams stitch together a ticketing tool like Jira Service Management or Zendesk with an inventory table in Airtable or a DB, and then use whatever BI layer your team already uses to run weekly audits. If you want non-technical managers to ask “who has the MacBook from April” without bothering IT, a natural language query layer can help; some folks use Metabase, Airtable plus reporting, or newer NL-to-SQL layers like Astrasql so people can get answers without learning SQL.",

Meeting notes and action items: Tools like Gong and Otter has allowed with the advancements in AI to auto transcribe both internal and customer meetings, take personal notes for me and also auto create action items for me. I have setups automation to even send the action items to right owners, update our CRM etc. This has been a huge time saver for me.\n2. Blogs and SEO: Again with advancements in AI, both analyzing our Google search data and creating SEO blogs daily to improve our search rankings have been mostly automated with AI tools like Frizerly that has all the context of our business, case studies etc. All I have to do now is review the drafts each week and click publish!\n3. Outbound Cold Emails: Again thanks to tools like Clay etc, we are not able to book sales calls almost without any manual intervention. Once you define your target buyer, these tools are able to auto reach out to them over email with quiet good personalized emails and get them to book a sales call with out team\n4. Repetitive Support questions: Tools like Intercom Fin has allowed us to eliminate repetitive customer tickets by auto resolving those from history or our faq/website data. Others are normally routed to humans.\n\nAnd that's all I can think of rn. But curious about others tho!",

It helps me:\n\n\\- Turn Google Search Console data into “here is what is going on” so I can then make decisions \n\n\\- Draft high quality outlines and first passes of content\n\n\\- Spot good backlink opportunities by scanning websites and pages and telling me which websites will pass the most authority \n\n\\- Now I do mostly reviewing and editing instead of staring at spreadsheets and data trying to figure what is going on.\n\n2) Call flows and decision trees for receptionists  \nOur team used to write every call flow and decision tree by hand, covering every little “if X then do Y” branch for different firms. It was boring, detailed work and would take up tons of time. Now we do a rough human draft of the logic on the front end, then let AI expand it, clean it up, and dang near get like 80% of the way perfecting it. We review, adjust a bit, then move forward with it. The result is better and we spend way less time on this now.\n\n3) Call analysis  \nWe still manually listen to calls when we are doing quality assurance or receptionist training. But if we need quick answers about what happened on a call, instead of listening to a 10 minute recording and taking notes, we can have AI summarize it and answer specific questions. That alone saves a lot of time.\n\n4) Receptionist role plays  \nWhen launching a new account we do training to make sure we perfect the process. We still role play human to human, but once we get that down and the receptionist “passes” the role play, we have the team role play with AI agents. The AI acts like the caller and runs them through different scenarios so they get comfortable and confident with the new client account. This has saved TONS of time.\n\n5) Weekly reporting and KPI summaries  \nI used to spend a couple of hours a week pulling numbers from different tools (GSC, call software, CRM) and turning that into a simple “how did we do this week” update. Now I have a basic setup that pulls the key metrics into one place and lets AI draft a short summary. I skim it, make small edits, and send it to the team. That pattern would work for almost any business that has a CRM and some analytics.\n\nI'm always looking for ways to save time and automate so interested to hear what others are doing too!",

Your first product won’t be your best.\n* **Marketing**: focus on storytelling, copywriting, and understanding human behavior.\n* **Tools**: choose 2 to 3 that help you automate and track, like CRM, email, and analytics.\n* **Social skills**: networking, collaboration, and negotiation are underrated but essential.\n* **Tech**: use basic no-code tools, AI assistants, and product validation.\n\nThe best founders aren’t experts in just one thing; they are very good at learning quickly.",

          "body": "Based on the consensus across this thread and real-world experience, here's what actually matters for online businesses and apps: First, sales and marketing are non-negotiable. I've seen technically perfect products fail because the founder couldn't communicate value or reach customers. Second, develop a relentless problem-solving mindset rather than chasing perfection in every skill area. Third, focus on customer discovery before you build anything - this saves you from building something nobody wants. Fourth, understand basic business fundamentals like cash flow and unit economics. Finally, consistency matters more than perfection at the start. The businesses that survive aren't run by experts in everything, but by people willing to learn what they need to learn when they need to learn it. Your biggest early wins will come from customer conversations and sales, not from having the perfect tech stack. Get out there, talk to real people, and start with whatever version of your idea will let you test assumptions quickly.",

          "body": "Here's my take. I used to run a construction business but taught myself how to build software. I developed my own crm, some marketing software, built the website and self hosted everything off a server in my apartment. On the plus side my office overhead was like $20/month for all the software we used because I built it.\n\nI tossed around the idea of starting a software company but I'm hesitent. Here's my take:\n\n1. As a non technical founder, you don't have the depth of knowledge to understand if a specific software stack is actually profitable. Most \"tech bros\" actually jam together a bunch of services and put their logo on it and call it \"their software\" when in reality they are paying 6 other companies for access to THEIR software. Basically you \"own the brand\" but not the actual software.\n2. Profitability is in the stack and not necessarily what the software does. For example, my website + lead gen software cost me $3/month. If you use wix, or another website builder, you'd pay $25-$50/month for the same service I get for $3 because I built it myself. So, if you don't create a \"software moat\" it's likely you'll end up using multiple other vendors to build your \"stack\" and end up bleeding all the upside in monthly API fees. If you build an AI automated CRM (for example) but you plug into AWS and GPT for api calls and hosting, you'll rack up $1000s/month in \"fees\". If you host the CRM yourself and train a small AI model, you're overhead would be near 0.\n3. The market is flooded and I mean FLOODED, with software. Unless you are excelent at sales and marketing, you'll struggle to provide any real value that other, larger companies don't. And, software behavior is very entrenched, people don't switch tools if ever. For example, a CRM, getting a company to switch from Microsoft to my CRM would be a nightmare and then try integrating it with their other workflows...just a huge hassle.\n\nAnyway, I'm not saying you can't do it. But from my perspective unless the software is self contained and built and the \"moat\" is in the stack - ie, cheap to actually scale, it's not an easy business to get into. Alot of the software bros you'll see either developed some niche tool that happens to solve some deep industry specific issue, OR were given a bunch of money and are living on hype and debt.\n\nTLDR \n\n  \nSo, is it worth it? Idk maybe lol. You don't need to be technical to sell something, but being technical helps because you can cut costs.",

Used it to find B2B leads for my consulting work (mostly targeting German companies - dentists, lawyers, small businesses).\n\nThe problem? Half the emails bounced. Customer support basically said \"yeah that happens.\" I was paying $1,250/month for a 50% accuracy rate. Insane.\n\nSo in February I got fed up and spent a weekend learning Python. Built a scraper that:\n- Finds .de domains in my target niches\n- Extracts emails from their contact pages (Impressum in Germany - legally required contact info)\n- Validates them before I even send an email\n\nRan it last month on ~2,500 dental practice websites:\n- Got 4,800+ emails \n- Bounce rate when I sent: 4.7% (vs the 50% I was getting before)\n- Cost: $43 in API fees + $12 AWS hosting\n\nI'm not trying to sell anything here. Just wanted to share because if you're paying for lead databases and getting garbage results like I was, you might want to look into building your own.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone's curious about the technical side.\n",

Remember the noise you hear will never be about the failures. For every win you see, there are 10,000 failures. Be positive you want it before you start.\n\n2. If you don’t know what kind of business you want to start with the 50k, I revisit my point above. You need to want it so bad to push through the “I can’t pay my bills next month” times that will inevitably come. In order to do that, you need to either love what you’re pursuing or at least thoroughly enjoy it enough to push through the hard. Cause there will be a lot of it. \n\n3. If you have 50k, 2-3k should be used to actually start the business + sheer hustle. The remaining 47k should be used to get you through making jack shit or being u profitable for X amount of time. Don’t overshoot too early, you likely won’t need half of the shit you’ll invest in before you actually get started. \n\n4. Most importantly, if you’re getting into business because you don’t want to work for someone else - be VERY careful about the business you choose, the way you set it up and how much overhead you take on. Cause what you’ll see happen without even noticing it happening is becoming an employee to your own business. Remember to OWN your business, don’t let it own you. \n\nHope this all helps!

They never asked for permission and would even pretend to be paying customers. They would pretend to look at things and then head out back. \n\nThen more photographers started coming. We had entire families dressed up for a shoot. Apparently word got out how pretty this place was for family pictures.\n\nI said something to one of the photographers and got an earful about how it's a public business that anyone  can access. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?

There's nothing wrong about that.\n\nAlso when it comes to savings, you never know how people have mentally allocated their money. Maybe that's \"the kids' inheritance\" in her mind, or \"just in case\" money, or maybe she's already earmarked it for something expensive that she hasn't paid for yet. You have no idea, so don't make assumptions.\n\nFinally, as a rule: don't discount your services unless that's part of your business model. Instead, if someone needs to spend less, figure out what you can offer that is inside their budget. If you're normally $100 and she only has $75, figure out what you can offer (profitably) at $75. It's more fair and avoids these kinds of conflicts.\n\nDo the work because you agreed to and you're a person of your word. If you *truly* feel deceived, just decline future work from this person.",

I wrote him emails, outlined my concerns that those clients didn't need us as bad as we needed them, that their balances were too high, that we couldn't swing those kind of outstanding balances.

He was an M&amp;A broker and claimed breach of contract for $1m in damages on a $20m sale. \n\nHe cleverly requested a jury trial instead of a judge trial since thats the plaintiffs right too choose.\n\nHis whole case was based on a verbal contract even though all he ever did was exchange about 8 emails with the owners and sat in on one meeting. The jury ultimately decided this was enough to establish a verbal contract and voted unanimously after 10 minutes of deliberation to award him $1m -- I shit you not.\n\nVerbal contracts do hold up in court.

One part time staff has asked if we plan to provide healthcare benefits (plus vision and dental) at some point. She has a daytime / full time job where she is getting benefits currently and said she would like to come over full time if we can provide benefits. She says that her current employer \"takes care of everything\" and that she does not pay any contribution to the plan. So I said I will look into it. For her plus her spouse and child, the total monthly premium on a mid-level package is about $2,200 per month if I did 100% employer contribution. For context she is support staff making $29 / hr.\n\nFor me it's too much of a stretch to justify at $26K annual benefits package for someone whose base is roughly $60K / yr. I could change the contribution rate to say 50/50, but then I'm not competitive with her current FT employer and I think the premium split at 50% would be prohibitive for her and her family anyway.\n\nSo the question is: how do small businesses do this? I know there are a lot of options out there, but for those of you that have been down this road, what did you learn along the way? What was the best option that you settled on? I'd really like to offer competitive comp packages, but health benefits seem especially difficult.\n\nThanks!",

Businesses,  unless they are a large group which can self fund their plan may have a chance if they really care out their PBM/specialty drugs. Not only that - but the value from healthcare today just isn’t there. It’s darn near impossible to get a primary care md, appt, much less specialty care. There are options to consider like direct primary care - and concierge medicine where people actually get to see a doctor on a regular basis.  At least there’s some continuity of care. Put it together with a major medical for catastrophic- and you may actually be able to get back to what it was before the ACA fully rolls back. Leverage a CannaRx for specialty meds.   What most people don’t quite understand is that insurance rates are based on a pooled population. The larger the pool, the lower rate for everybody whether you’re buying from the exchanges or whether you’re buying a private plan from a carrier.  Doesn’t matter. So what’s happening now is you’re getting a smaller pool. The people left in the pool pay more. =ALL insured people will pay more. There is no replacement for “Obamacare”  and it’s pretty clear the “concepts of a plan” is nothing.  So what’s the solution? Either talk to a broker about self- funding- to be safe you should have about $250k to even have that discussion. The other option is a voucher - not sure how fast that’s all getting repealed. You should talk to a small market broker. As a small employer- things are just getting more difficult (tariffs - direct and indirect impact), labor crunch-immigration, and this is one more measure to make it harder to retain good talent. I’m sorry. I had 3 locations and just shuttered 2 because of all of the above. Last year I saw the writing on the wall and re-og’d.

My former business partner hired a woman and she wanted no health insurance premium deducted from her paycheck. He just docked the amount she was going to receive from the amount of her premium. Employers of big companies get a break on costs, but not huge ones, so unless she’s coming from a government job, or a huge multinational, her take home is probably lessened by her employer covering the total cost.\n\nWhat I would do is, tell her that your cost to insure her is $2200/mo, you can have it so she pays 0, but it will be reflected in her hourly pay at take home. Sometimes I don’t think employees look at total compensation, paid vacation, sick and health benefits all cost money, so when we pay those out, it’s part of their total pay package. Some just look at the hourly rate and base it on that, which is unfair if you provide other benefits.",

For that relationship to be successful the previous generation has to set their ego aside and trust the person in the day to day has it covered, and the person in day to day has to leverage the more experienced person when it makes sense.  A parent/child relationship has so much ego tied to it.\n\nI imagine a lot of second generation took over the business because it was their dad/mom’s passion and they wanted to make them happy. By the 3rd generation it’s like ‘wait, so you don’t even really care about this, you just know all the people and everything about it?’\n\nYou need systems and tools in place to manage your business and empower your people to innovate and improve.  A lot of small businesses run those things on gut feel, which is a hard skill to transfer.",

The businesses that tend to be most successful or our family own businesses are the ones where the younger generation is required to work in different parts of the company, and not immediately given senior management role right after college\n\nGeneration X my generation might be more guilty of elevating our kids to higher positions of power too quickly in a company … any younger people tend to have a little bit more sense of entitlement than older generations, which is always been the case\n\nBut I can think of a number of very successful companies that are being run by the third generation right now",

My wife and I will probably pour everything into causes we are passionate about, instead of dumping it all on our family.\n\nSo yes IF expected the 2nd or 3rd generation to maintain and grow things; I don't think it would happen. Some of them have the ability, but not the desire. I believe people should pursue their own passion and path in this short life.",

      "selftext": "I've been doing web design for small businesses for years and I thought it might be useful to share something because I keep seeing the same mistake over and over.\n\nBusiness owners spend thousands making their site look \"professional\" then wonder why nobody's calling. The problem is you're designing for other business owners, not your actual customers.\n\nHere's what I see constantly: Giant hero image with some stock photo of people way too happy about a laptop. Tagline like \"Your Trusted Partner in Excellence\" that tells me absolutely nothing. I have to scroll three times to figure out if you're a plumber or a marketing agency.\n\nOr fancy parallax effects and auto playing videos that look cool for 5 seconds until you realize the page takes forever to load on mobile. Your bounce rate is probably 80% and you can't figure out why.\n\nThe real problem I see is you're asking \"does this look professional?\" instead of \"will this help someone become my customer?\"\n\nWhat actually works is someone lands on your homepage and knows in 3 seconds what you do and why they should care. Not clever wordplay, just straight up \"We fix commercial HVAC in the GTA and show up within 2 hours.\"\n\nYour call to action button should be so obvious. Big, bright, impossible to miss. Not buried after your company manifesto.\n\nTry this: show your homepage to someone for 5 seconds. Ask them what you do and what they should do next. **If they can't answer both, your design is in the way.**\n\nA simple site that converts is worth infinitely more than a gorgeous site where the phone never rings.\n\nTLDR: If visitors can't figure out what you do and what to do next in 5 seconds, your pretty design is just expensive decoration.",

From a customer perspective, I absolutely hate sites where it takes a bunch of poking around and trying to see past this or that 'clever' animation or video to find the actual function or information I'm looking for.\n\nAre you taking notes every time a potential customer phones or emails you, at least to the point of ticking a box or two regarding what they were asking about? Are you using the collated data from those tickboxes to make the most common queries the things that display FIRST AND FOREMOST on your site? Even if they're not glamorous?\n\nIf I'm pulling up 10 business sites from a Google search to get a quick idea of which one is most likely to be able to sell me what I'm after, I'm looking for a site which says WHAT it sells, lets me instantly do a product/service/catalog search (no, not click down through a tree of jargon categories as the only option), lets me buy directly from the interface if I find what I want, and lets me one-click to contact numbers and location maps - including product pickup location maps which have that product, not just store location maps.\n\nThe actual name of the business is far, far down my list of what I'm after. Put it off in a corner somewhere at the top of the site pages as a header or template, have it in the domain name or at least the URL, and so on, but don't make it take up the entire screen on my PC or phone, don't make me have to click/swipe *past* it to actually find anything useful, and don't do 'clever' things like have it appear giant-size and only minimize after a second or two. You are getting in the way of my purchasing experience, and I have tabs with nine of your competitors already open.\n\nSimilar approaches apply to things like IVRs. Put the most commonly-sought topics right at the top of the tree, and don't make people listen to 9000 options before getting to \"for all other queries, press...\" - people WILL get fed up and start smashing '0' long before that because you're both wasting their time and irritating them even before you personally speak to them.\n\n(Similarly with being on phone-hold. Don't force people to listen to ads. Don't force people to listen to hold-music. DO tell people where they are in the queue and what the likely wait time is, and DO give them an option for the business to call them back if they don't have the spare time to sit on the phone moldering away. And never, ever let an automated information system hang up on a caller; someone who's taken ten minutes to finally find the robo-answer to their query may well also want to speak to someone or at least go back to the main menu, not to realize they've been cut off and will have to ring back and wait AGAIN.\n\n(I'd also have an IVR where anyone who's had an open call doing anything at all for half an hour, even going around in circles, automatically gets a new spoken/menu option to speak directly to a human being. If you're worried about queue-jumping, why do you have such long wait-times?)",

      "selftext": "This is based in Ontario, Canada 🇨🇦 \n\nI am not mentioning names because I do not want legal issues, but I need to get this off my chest.\n\nA while ago I started providing cleaning services for a couple who owned an Airbnb. The husband acted like a big entrepreneur and constantly talked up his plans. His wife was an influencer with millions of followers. I barely ever spoke to her and she never communicated with me, but he kept bringing her up as if her follower count meant their business was legitimate.\n\nHis business partner was a realtor and the two of them acted like they were on the verge of building a large real estate empire. They told me they were buying 13 properties in Orlando and said I would get all the cleaning contracts. I run a cleaning agency and handle hiring, interviews, scheduling and operations, but I still let their hype get to me.\n\nLooking back, it is embarrassing how much I believed them.\n\nThey pushed me to lower my prices and told me I would make more long term because of the volume they would bring. Lower rates meant cleaners made less money and did not want to work their job, which caused constant staffing issues. They did not care. They just wanted cheaper labor.\n\nThey nitpicked everything. Small towel marks, tiny smudges, anything they could point to. One time four towels were slightly dirty. Instead of washing them, he ordered more than two hundred dollars worth of towels and cloths without asking and then made me pay him back for the order. He acted like he was helping me by explaining how to claim the HST.\n\nHe often acted friendly and gave me advice as if he was mentoring me, then switched into being demanding and controlling. The most insulting thing he said was, “You should not run a cleaning business if you are not a cleaner.” I run a real agency. I am educated and I manage the business. I do not need to personally scrub toilets to operate a company. His comment showed he did not respect what I built.\n\nSomething important is that during this time I kept asking him about Orlando. I told him I was planning to open a branch there. I told him I was hiring people. He knew I was taking the opportunity seriously and believed what he said. Despite that he kept lying about the 13 houses and the future work. He watched me prepare for something that did not exist.\n\nEventually my only Hamilton cleaner quit and after more than thirty hours of interviewing and reviewing applications I realized the entire situation was a dead end. Their budget did not match their expectations and every cleaner disliked going there. The promises were never real.\n\nI finally sent a formal message ending the relationship and telling them I would no longer be providing cleaning services. They never replied. No thank you. No acknowledgment. Nothing.\n\nThat silence told me everything.\n\nHere is the interesting part. Because of their constant talk about Orlando, I actually opened a branch there. I hired people and started operating. And somehow it worked. I am now running my agency in Orlando and so far it has been more successful than what I had in Hamilton. I never would have considered Orlando if it was not for their story, even though their own plans were fake.\n\nSo in a strange way, something good did come out of this. I just had to learn the hard way that not everyone who talks big is telling the truth.\n\nHere is what I learned:\n\nPeople connected to influencers are not automatically professional or honest.\nPeople who promise future opportunities often want discounts today.\nFriendly behavior does not mean respect.\nAnyone who tries to devalue your work is not a partner and never will be.\nSometimes walking away is the best business decision you can make.\n\n\n\n\nForgot to add:\n\nThe biggest red flag I ignored was the fact that they dropped their long time cleaner for my company. No warning to her, nothing. They just kicked her out to start using me. She was really good to them from what I heard &amp; only had a minor scheduling issue. Also, the main guy I was dealing with lied to me that “guests are refusing to pay the higher cleaning fee” when he never updated the cleaning fee on Airbnb from $120 to $200 (which is what I charged him). I know this because I checked the listing every day for new reviews. So that was also a ploy to get me to lower the cleaning fee… I’m probably forgetting some things.",

Ever since the owner started handling customers (after covid) they started feeling too disrespected to continue a business relationship.

We sell into SMBs, Midmarket, and through resellers MSPs/MSSPs/Partners etc... our security awareness platform took us 5+ years to develop into anything with Product Market Fit (PMF).  Then we iterated over the last 6 years into something that we're proud of, something disruptive.\n\nNow that we're selling into Mid-market and planning for Enterprise sales we are securing our SOC2 Type II audit opinion (Q1 2026).  We're in heavy preparation mode now.  While we still don't truly need it, the expansion into midmarket and enterprise will be much easier if we can hand over our SOC2 audit opinion when pursing this business.\n\nThere IS enormous value for us in securing the SOC2. It has many strong prescriptions in it for the Security Controls such as penetration testing, endpoint protection, documented processes around change and incident management and so much more.  We do all these things as part of our vCISO service offering.  We even have helped others secure their SOC2 type II audits, but it was time for us to ensure everything was buttoned up in our own business and get the audit.  It helped focus our existing processes and refine them into truly operational procedures we follow.\n\nThe costs of SOC2 assessments have been coming down as well.  Traditional vendors like Drata, Vanta, SecureFrame, or you can save some time and money with some new AI start-ups (do your homework please).  One AI based startup in the SOC2 space is Delve.  We've gone with them and they are pretty responsive to our questions, and their value proposition was amazing in comparison to the larger more traditional Tooling vendors.\n\nUltimately, you can say no.  Just be prepared to get a lot of TPRM (Third Party Risk Management) questionnaires, and be sure to DO what you SAY YOU DO in your answers (they will check and ask for evidence until your get an Auditor confirmation of things in a SOC2 Type II).",

The revenue you get from enterprise customers can't just be from increased scale. The value you're delivering to enterprise customers is magnitudes greater than the value you're delivering SMBs, so your price better reflect that.

It's one of those things you don't need to do until you need to do it. The cost and time sink can be brutal early on. What I've found with most startups I've worked with is that most enterprise clients will send you a security questionnaire anyway, and SOC 2 is just one tick box - they still want to know about your encryption, access controls, developer training, all of it. So make sure your fundamental security is watertight first, then consider SOC 2 when you're actually losing deals without it. You'll know when that happens - suddenly every enterprise client will be asking for it.\n\n\\- Luke @ Baremetrics",

A lot of them also have RFPs, so you can spend a week with a team combing through the details and building a very thought through proposal. \n\nIn the last 4 months, we have been told that we've won 9 contracts that would have been taken from this competitor, however, in every single instance, they had the option in their existing contract to price match and ultimately got to keep it themselves. All the time and effort we put in it just so the big guy can say yeah we'll do that is tiring. \n\nHow can you possibly get past this? \n\nIt's almost all about the money by the way. Corporations, hotel chains, HOA boards are the ones making these decisions. If they can squeak out more money for the deal that's all that matters to them unless someone royally screws up. The little things like we provide better customer service, we're technology focused, increase customer spending etc are all looked at as salesman fluff. \n\nAlso you don't get to meet with the decision makers very easily. Going after a Hilton hotel, the local GM has little say. Going after a neighborhood, there are a dozen people on the HOA board and you may have only spoken to one of them.\n\nWhat can be done here?",

Faster response times, better staff who are treated and paid better so are nicer to the customers etc. Whatever it takes.\n\nThis isn't foolproof though - if the customer has a checklist of requirements, then it's easy for them to overlook the nuances of the quality of those things, especially if they're procuring from head office, where checklists and price are all they're really going to look at....so you really need to go deep on how you are more than just A N Other supplier, so deep in fact that it becomes obvious that the BEST monopoly supplier can do is not even acceptable in your world.\n\nAlternatively, you can play the longer game. Note, I've seen this play out myself, but in the software world rather than services. The principle is the same, however.\n\nYou know when contracts are due up, so instead of waiting for the RFP to be issued, spend 12-18 months running up to it effectively demonstrating how your service is better. Attend relevant conferences and trade shows. Figure out a new process, give it a funky name. Make sure that by the time the RFP is being put together, your approach is already on their lips. Make it so those going shopping are already thinking about what you offer, and then be the ones to actually offer it.\n\nBasically, spend some time in the run up to contract renewals seeding potential clients with you, your approach, and how it's the right choice. The more subliminal / indirect, the better. If you can leave them wanting something and not even knowing who provides it until your proposal ticks every box, then you've done it perfectly.\n\nMake this large company compete with you, rather than the other way around.",

It’s designed for true, small business like your local hardware store. I wouldn’t recommend it if you plan to scale. But to your point, Gusto’s customer support is absolutely terrible and the disconnect from the support team to their assurance team is the reason I’m walking away from them. \n\nI did a significant amount of research and landed on Bamboo as I felt it was the best end-to-end human capital management platform.",

Everything is via a \"ticket\" which isn't very helpful when a state agency says there's something wrong with payroll.\n\nThey also cost more than my local CPA's payroll service does.\n\n&gt;I'll go ahead and take some heat. Rippling is an absolutely awful horseshit payroll agency.\n\n&gt;They refused to comply with the laws for workers' comp in my state, insisting that some third-party they use would \"provide my workers' compensation\" (my state has a state-run monopoly on workers' comp). This third-party (and Rippling) failed to open a Workers Comp account, had no place for me to enter my own Workers Comp account number, and never filed any reports with the state, besides saying they did. They also said \"sorry too bad you are locked into a 18 month contract with us and you can't leave and will have to keep paying\" - for a payroll service I COULD NOT USE.\n\n&gt;I consulted with a CPA and an LLM (a type of lawyer who specialises in taxes, nothing to do with AI), and the state Workers Comp themselves. All of them said Rippling was full of shit. But some good news:\n\n&gt;State Workers Comp said they had so many other small employers who had run into this problem - apparently with the third party who actually runs Rippling's payroll, Rippilng doesn't even run their own technology, they hire it out - who mess up state Workers Comp that they would waive all penalties and fees and helped me prepare my Workers Comp reports to get caught up.\n\n&gt;I finally informed Rippling that a qualified CPA, an actual lawyer, and the state itself all said Rippling were wrong. Their response? \"We will be happy to offboard you and refund all charges.\"\n\n&gt;Get a real payroll company like ADP who actually knows how to do payroll. Or just go with your local CPA! Most of them can do it and you will have a REAL person you can call and talk to you when something goes wrong.",

Parking good? Area good? A place people have heard of? can you get there and set up in a timely fashion? If it’s a recurring event just go before you sign up to do it\n- who’s putting it on? Are they legit? Have they done other events? Well organized?\n- when/where/how is the event being promoted?\n- who’s engaging with the promotion? Other vendors only or general public?\n\nThings you should ask:\n- if there’s a vendor fee, what does that cover?\n- do they provide tents/tables or do you need to bring your own?\n- when/where/how is the event being promoted? Any graphics you can share on your own social media page \n- what other vendors are going to be there? Are they selling something super similar?\n- where are you in relation to main programming? \n- is there any adjacent programming that will draw people to the area?\n- point of contact for day of event \n\nAnother option is to ask local bars/breweries/unrelated retailers if she can setup shop in a corner. \n\nNot an exhaustive but has helped me avoid duds.",

I own a boutique and frequently have people like your GF or others who make something (bread, jewelry, crochet, pottery, art, etc) stop in wanting to know if I will sell their goods. \n\nThis can be handled two ways...on consignment meaning the shop is going to keep between 10-30% of the sale OR just an outright wholesale buy (pay cash, buy the items, sell them as they please). In our town and many area towns there is an upsurge of shops that do nothing but that....they \"rent\" out space to vendors like your GF and sell their wares and at the end of the month the vendor is paid for what has sold. \n\nI had a friend who made baby clothing, custom pillows, etc and after encouraging her to create  a line list of her products, a brief description, and her pricing structure she was able to approach shops and is now I believe in around 6 shops in our and area towns. She would do markets or shows but found between the fee, making product to sell, the set up and tear down that she sometimes sold nothing or nothing worthwhile. \n\nWith this approach, she makes enough product for each shop....delivers it and replenishes throughout the month as needed and accepts custom orders.

I would say to keep going. Start trying to make posts on social media if she already hasn't. It helps a lot to share your story or process of doing it. It's hard to start I'm not going to lie, but she will find her niche eventually. Sometimes starting on Etsy is also a good way to go about it as well if she's not already doing so. There are also artist communities all over the world from what I know :) She may be able to find a small one in your area. They usually have discords of FB groups and it helps out a lot when you can connect with other small business owners and artists. Good luck to her!

One of those is your expectations and metrics for success. Being her first market, not only are you new to buyers, but you're also new to other sellers, and likely also new to *selling* directly to people. There is so much that will passively go into this (\"Do I look nice?\" \"Does my products look nice?\" \"Man I must look like an idiot to all these other vendors\" etc etc). My metric for my first market was \"hand out 5 business cards and have one detailed conversation about the craft\" (I do custom game consoles if you're curious). I didn't sell anything at this market, but I didn't consider it a failure because I accomplished:\n\n* Learning how to set up at a market\n* Learning how to break down after a market\n* Practicing my pitch\n* Hearing different questions/comments people had and considering how I could better address that\n* Meeting some of the other vendors in my local market scene\n* Doing something new to me, which while not necessarily directly impacting my business, does help with leading a personally fulfilling life. It gets pretty boring to just to the same 5 things over and over, at least to me :)\n* Met my two pre-set metrics above! \n* Getting your name out there; if this is a recurring show and you go often enough you *will* get people to start recognizing you\n\nShe may or may not value the exact things I listed here, but I can pretty much guarantee that if she sits down and thinks about it she would be able to come up at least 2 positive things about the market, especially as a first go at it. One of the best things about having a partner is that they can help you see things you may be blind to because you're caught up worrying about one specific thing (like if you're the biggest idiot on the planet for thinking someone would be stupid enough to buy something you made), so you can thank my wife for helping me to see the positives of my first market where I sold nothing despite stressing for a month I didn't have enough inventory to even show up, lol. \n\nHope this helps, and glad to see you're trying to help each other out.\n\nAs a final note, I definitely suggest looking for juried markets. It will help to cut down on AI/MLM stuff, which no one actually likes to see which will hurt attendance for the show. I find if shows accept things like this they are more concerned with their booth fees vs putting on a good show for the vendors/attendees. If it is an option I suggest attending markets at the location and see what the vibe is like!",

I'd suggest looking at the basics:\n• Did leads drop?\n• Did conversion rate drop?\n• Did average job value drop?\n• Or did service slip and you lost customers?\n\nOnce you know the reason, you then need clarity on how to fix it. Then I'd suggest you define what \"good\" looks like for your sales each week (X leads, Y quotes, Z conversions). Whats your target needed to reach your number? Then focus on consistently hitting those numbers. That’s what gets you back on track.",

I want to help you but I’d rather explain the difference between advice and criticism vs. responsibility and ownership \n\nI’d say everyone think that they’re experts and nobody business is going to be a constant uphill, eventually the fall of Alexander the Great was of his own greed and demise, so with that being said you haven’t even become great yet. \n\nAdvice comes from a place of love and kindness. Nobody who can give good advice thinks about themselves, they \nlove hearing stories and love the world in a way that we step out of our comfort zone and help others to find solutions for themselves that we didn’t even think of.\n\nIt is possible to turn this thing around, there is a way out!\n\nIt’s the way you present yourself and your business to its customers. \nSeparate yourself from your business and make sure that your business has everything it needs to succeed. You are the owner. \n\nOwnership and responsibility is apart of the equation. You can’t own up to your faults if you don’t know them.\n\nDon’t take it so harshly because you still made a good deal of money. Whatever you did in the beginning worked! Keep your head up and increase your network, once the network increases, your net worth increases.\n\nIt’s a shame, you do 3.5 million in sales and I don’t even know what your business is. Please contact our group let us know what you do and we can HELP you and give you our coins if we only knew what your business is.\n\nLet’s network together!",

So that’s all on the bad side. The good news is once you can figure out some stuff thru trial and error or even on here, u start to build *some* momentum. Get some courage. Some positive self talk like “ok I’ve been here before. Not in this exact situation but I’ve overcome a ton to even get here. 10 years ago if someone would’ve said this is the issue, I would’ve been happy to handle this challenge. I got thru this before and I can get thru this now.” \n\nTrust me, I get it. I’m going thru a very similar thing right now in my business. I’m in digital marketing and Google has completely screwed up my business model. I’ve been depressed about it for about 2 years now. Shit ton of work with very little profit to show for despite a lot of cash flow and 21 employees. Complete madness. I always thought I can turn it around. It looks like I cannot and I have to pivot. \n\nBottom line is this. Talk it out. If you don’t have anyone to bounce ideas off of that u trust and respect, take a few days and throw it into GPT. This thing is absolutely freaking amazing and will be your most logical partner. People are not getting good results because they haven’t tuned it. Out the box is pretty good but tuned up it’s absolutely freakin amazing!\n\nI wish you well. You’re not a failure. You just need perspective. You need to adapt. Just like me.
