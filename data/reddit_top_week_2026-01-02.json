          "body": "Yes, I started a side hustle in 2018 and walked away from my 9-5 in 2022, after building it into a six-figure business. People have different reasons for wanting to escape the 9-5. In my case, I was burned out, dealing with an abusive, toxic boss. I was 42 years old at the time, married, with three kids, and a single-income family (my wife is a homemaker). I was staring down another 20 years and felt like I had no options. \n\nI could have jumped ship to the same job at another company, but I knew it could turn out just as bad, or worse. I also wanted more freedom. I was tired of faking enthusiasm at work, and wanted more freedom to travel and spend time with my kids. \n\nAnyways, in the first month (June 2018), I made $200 with my side hustle. One year later, I was making $2000, then $5000, and so on. In September 2022, I reached a point where I was making the same income on the side as I was at my 9-5 (around $120k/year). \n\nI went to a conference in Orlando, Florida, hoping to get one more client for my business. If that happened, I could leave my 9-5 within about 6 months. But I got 5 clients at the conference, flew home, and told my wife I had to make a choice. I had to choose between turning down all the work I landed or quitting my job. I could no longer balance both.   \n  \nShe immediately said, \"It's time for you to quit. You got this.\"  \n\nI called my boss at the bank and gave him my 2 weeks notice over the phone. He thought I was crazy (he also thought my side hustle was selling t-shirts) lol. I walked out of my office for the last time on October 1, 2022.  \n\nI've never experienced a greater feeling of freedom than that moment. And it hasn't subsided. I think about it every day. I managed to build a fully remote lifestyle business in my mid-40s and exited the corporate world during my peak earning years. \n\nToday, my once side hustle is now a $20k/month business (2 businesses actually - I started a second one).   \nMy kids are all out of the house (our youngest is 19 and is moving to Hawaii for 6 months in a couple of weeks). My wife and I will be travelling this winter (we live in Canada), and I'll just work from my laptop. My wife helps me run the business.   \n  \nIf you're just getting started and want to build something that you can scale full-time, but don't know what to focus on, here's my advice:   \n  \nThe perfect side side hustle has 3 ingredients: \n\n1. Something you're good at (don't follow your passion, follow your talent and skills). If you lack the skills, pick something that you can learn. \n\n2. Something you enjoy: It doesn't have to be your lifelong passion, but if you're going to invest thousands of hours building something, you can't hate it. Here's the good news (relating to step 1)... people usually enjoy what they're good at. \n\n3. Something you can scale: Don't start a side hustle that can't replace your 9-5 income. That's fine if you're just wanting to make a few extra bucks on the side, but not if you want to escape the 9-5. So, no Uber or Lyft...no DoorDash or dog-walking. Ain't gonna cut it. Think, service-based businesses aka freelancing. That's your best bet to make good money fast. \n\nI could go on forever (sorry for the long-winded post), but my last piece of advice is to just get started. Most people want to figure everything out BEFORE they start, but you can't get clarity until AFTER taking action. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions about my story or need any help!",

          "body": "Not there yet, but actively building toward it. Here's my path so far:\n\nContext: 49, full-time job, two kids, building products between 9 PM and midnight after everyone's asleep.\n\nWhat I'm building: Portfolio of small digital products (SaaS/web apps) solving problems I've personally experienced. Currently have 2 launched, 3 more in development.\n\nCurrent state: \\~$150 MRR across products. Not replacement income, but proof the concept works.\n\nTimeline: Started learning to code (with AI tools - I'm not technical) in March 2025. So about 9 months in.\n\nThe strategy that's working:\n\nMultiple small bets instead of one big bet. Each product targets different audiences (family memory preservation, burnout prevention for founders, productivity coaching, etc.). If one fails, the others keep building.\n\nShip fast, ship imperfect. I've learned more from 2 launched products than I did from 6 months of planning.\n\nBuild from personal pain. Every product solves a problem I actually had. Makes the marketing authentic because I'm just sharing my story.\n\nWhat I'm learning:\n\nIt's a marathon. 9 months in, I'm nowhere near quitting my job, but the trajectory is there. Each month the products improve, the revenue grows (slowly), the audience builds.\n\nAge is actually an advantage. 20+ years of business experience means I know how to talk to customers, position products, avoid obvious mistakes. I don't have the energy I had at 25, but I don't waste time on BS either.\n\nThe \"work whenever/wherever\" dream is real but requires building the foundation first. Right now I'm grinding nights and weekends. But I can see the path to freedom.\n\nTactical advice:\n\nDon't wait for the perfect idea. Start with something you personally need and would pay for. If you'd pay for it, others probably will too.\n\nPortfolio &gt; single product. Diversification isn't just for stocks. Multiple small income streams are more stable than betting everything on one app.\n\nUse AI tools if you're not technical. Claude + Cursor = I can build functional products despite zero coding background before 2024.\n\nReality check: I'm not posting this from a beach with laptop. I'm still grinding the 9-5. Still building at night exhausted. Still months/years away from replacement income.\n\nBut the dream is closer than it was 9 months ago. And that's progress.\n\nThe fact that you're asking this question means you're ready to take the risk. Start building something this week. Doesn't matter what. Just start.\n\nWhat skills or problems do you have that could translate to a side hustle? Happy to brainstorm if helpful.",

Wouldn’t let me run the shop I needed to get stuff done right and efficiently. Had run my uncles shop prior to that for 4 years as well but he was a horrible boss too. But he did me a favor by giving me first dibs of buying his shop off him. He was done with it and I took the leap. \n\nNow I run my own body shop business and have my dad and brother as employees. We make about $400K in sales annually. Pretty much support ourselves and help each other out when needed. It’s easy work for us and proud to work together.",

It wasn't much but it started a momentum.\n\nSince then I've been on the lookout for these opportunities and now I make around $300-500 per month (I know it's less than what most people on this sub make) through a bunch of inconsistent sources. Data cleanup on Excel, surveys, calendar management for mid sized agencies, and a few other random things here and there.\n\nIt's not regular income and some months are better than others, but I genuinely couldn't have started on this path without that first $10 push from that random post. Once you make that first bit of money online something just shifts in how you see opportunities.\n\nI want to know what was your first source of online income because we all know starting out is the hardest part. After that first payment it becomes so much easier to believe it's possible and keep going.  \nWhat got you started?\n\n  \nEdit: I am getting a lot of DMs asking for the list of platforms where I find these gigs/surveys so I am just putting it all here:\n\nSmall gigs\\[VA, data cleanup etc\\]  : Upwork and fiverr\n\n  \nFor surveys (long list tbh so I'll just list the ones which make me the highest) : \n\nPro-lific (I had an account on this for a long time, recently have slowed down invitations for new users, just want people to have realistic expectations). \n\nBabki app (it's relatively new so low competition and has been consistent for me)",

Maybe something super niche, random, or just for fun that somehow began paying you.\n\n\n\nFor example, I’ve even messed around with random little things like playing mobile games on Mistplay, where you rack up points just by playing and swap them for gift cards, which felt way too casual to count as a side hustle at first.\n\n\n\nWould love to hear your stories, what unique or surprising thing ended up making you money on the side?",

      "selftext": "I've been flipping electronics (mostly Gaming PCs) and other items (random vintage stuff) as a side hustle for about 5 years now. Started at thrift stores, garage sales, then moved to online sourcing from Facebook Marketplace, OfferUp, etc.\n\n**The Problem That Was Killing My Efficiency:**\n\nThe actual sourcing part was taking FOREVER. For every item I'd consider buying:\n\n* Take photo or screenshot\n* Google Lens it to identify what it is\n* Search eBay sold listings manually as a makeshift eBay price checker\n* Calculate fees (eBay takes 13.25%, PayPal another cut, shipping costs)\n* Figure out actual profit margin\n* Decide if it's worth my time\n* Add to my tracking spreadsheet if I bought it\n\nThis process took 5-10 minutes per item. When you're looking at 50+ items a day, that's 4+ hours just doing research trying to answer \"what is this worth\" and \"how much can I sell this for.\"\n\n**What I Learned After 5 Years:**\n\nThe difference between profitable flippers and people who quit is speed of decision-making. You need to know instantly:\n\n* Is this worth buying?\n* What's my actual profit after all fees?\n* How fast will it sell?\n* Any red flags I should check?\n\n**My Solution (After Trying Everything):**\n\nI tried various reseller tools:\n\n* ChatGPT (too generic, doesn't know current prices)\n* Google Lens (identifies item but no profit analysis)\n* Manual eBay research (too slow)\n* Various paid tools (either too expensive or missing key features)\n\nNone of them did the full workflow for retail arbitrage, so I spent 6 months building my own reseller app that works as a complete deal finder app and thrift store price checker app:\n\n* Identifies the item from a photo (brand, model, year, condition)\n* Pulls real eBay sold prices (not asking prices - actual sales)\n* Calculates net profit after ALL fees with a built-in profit calculator for resellers (platform fees, payment processing, shipping)\n* Gives a deal score (0-100) so I know instantly if it's a good deal to flip\n* Flags red flags (common fakes, damage to check for, authentication tips)\n* Tracks everything in one place (what I paid, where I sourced it, sale price, actual ROI)\n\nTakes 15-30 seconds per analysis instead of 5-10 minutes. It's basically become the best app for resellers in my workflow because it answers \"is this worth buying\" instantly.\n\n**Real Example:**\n\nFound a Canon camera lens at a thrift store for $45. Took a photo:\n\n* Item identified: Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM lens\n* eBay sold median: $98\n* After fees &amp; shipping: $73 net to me\n* Profit: $28 (62% ROI)\n* Deal score: 78/100 (GOOD)\n* Days to sell: 7-14 days typically\n* Red flags: Check for lens fungus, test autofocus\n* Best platform: eBay\n\nTotal time: 20 seconds. I bought it, sold it 9 days later for $95, netted $27 after everything. Analysis was spot-on.\n\n**The ROI on This Approach:**\n\nBefore automation:\n\n* Research time: 4+ hours/day\n* Items analyzed: 50-60/day\n* Items bought: 5-8/day (lots of bad decisions from rushed research)\n* Average profit per flip: $18\n* Monthly profit: \\~$2,000\n\nAfter automation with my reselling app:\n\n* Research time: 45 minutes/day\n* Items analyzed: 80-100/day (faster = more opportunities)\n* Items bought: 12-15/day (better decisions = higher hit rate)\n* Average profit per flip: $24 (avoiding duds)\n* Monthly profit: \\~$4,300\n\nThe 3+ hours I save daily let me either source more or actually have free time.\n\n**Key Insights for Anyone Doing This Side Hustle:**\n\n**Speed matters more than perfection** \\- If you spend 10 minutes researching a $15 profit item, you just made $90/hour. Not bad, but you could analyze 6 items in that time and find a $50 profit item instead. This is why having a thrift store app that works like a retail arbitrage scanner app is crucial for making money flipping.\n\n**Know your fees cold** \\- eBay: 13.25% + $0.30. PayPal/Managed Payments: 2.9% + $0.30. Shipping varies. Factor ALL of this in with a reseller profit margin calculator or you're fooling yourself on profit.\n\n**Sold prices, not asking prices** \\- I don't care if someone is asking $200. I care what it actually sold for recently using a comparable sales finder. Huge difference.\n\n**ROI &gt; Profit sometimes** \\- A $10 item that flips for $40 (300% ROI) in 3 days is often better than a $50 item that flips for $90 (80% ROI) in 60 days. Your money is tied up. A good thrift haul profit calculator helps you understand this.\n\n**Platform matters** \\- Some items sell better on Poshmark (great Poshmark seller tools exist now), others on eBay, Mercari, or Facebook Marketplace. Knowing which platform to use with a Facebook Marketplace listing analyzer saves time and fees.\n\n**Track everything** \\- I log every single flip: source, cost, fees, sale price, days to sell. This data tells me which categories are most profitable and where to focus my time. Essential for understanding how much profit can I make flipping different categories.\n\n**Common Mistakes I Made (So You Don't Have To):**\n\n❌ Buying items because \"it seems valuable\" without checking actual sold prices (no flipping app to verify)   \n❌ Forgetting to factor in shipping costs (kills your margin fast)   \n❌ Not checking for fakes (lost $200 on a \"Nike\" jacket once - now I use authentication tips)   \n❌ Listing on wrong platform (eBay fees ate my profit when Facebook Marketplace would've been free)   \n❌ Not tracking my flips (couldn't tell which categories were actually profitable)\n\n**Results After Systematizing Everything:**\n\n* Monthly revenue: $4,500-7,000\n* Monthly profit: $2,000-3,000\n* Time invested: \\~20-30 hours/week when I'm off work (real side hustle app potential)\n* Best month: $7,200 profit (holiday season + few very lucky finds at thrift store)\n\n**Is This Actually Scalable?**\n\nYes and no. You're limited by:\n\n* Time to source (finding deals)\n* Time to list (photos, descriptions, shipping)\n* Storage space (inventory)\n* Cash flow (buying inventory)\n\nI've maxed out around $3k/month profit working 20 hours/week solo. To scale past that, you'd need to hire help or transition to wholesale/arbitrage models.\n\nFor a side hustle though? This beats most gig work. $2-3k/month for 20 hours/week doing thrift flips with the right reseller tools.\n\n**The Unglamorous Truth:**\n\nThis isn't passive income. You're trading time for money, just at a better rate than most side hustles. It's:\n\n* Driving to thrift stores\n* Scrolling Facebook Marketplace at 6am when new stuff drops (having a Facebook Marketplace app helps)\n* Taking photos and writing listings\n* Packaging and shipping\n* Dealing with buyer questions and returns\n\nBut it's flexible (work whenever), low barrier to entry (start with $100), and actually profitable if you're systematic about it.\n\n**Questions I Always Get:**\n\n**Q: What items should I flip?** A: Start with what you know. I do electronics because I can spot deals and know common issues. Others do clothing, shoes, collectibles, books. Knowledge = edge. Learning what to flip from thrift stores and understanding the best items to resell from garage sales takes time. Using a price checker app speeds up the learning curve dramatically. Many people ask about goodwill finds worth money - electronics, vintage items, and brand-name goods are solid bets.\n\n**Q: How much money do I need to start?** A: I started with $100. Buy a few items, sell them, reinvest. You'll be cash-flow limited at first but it builds.\n\n**Q: Where do you source?** A: Thrift stores (Goodwill, Value Village), garage sales, estate sales, Facebook Marketplace, OfferUp, Craigslist. Online sourcing is huge now. Having an app to check eBay prices and a Mercari price checker helps when sourcing online.\n\n**Q: What about returns/scams?** A: Happens. eBay heavily favors buyers. Budget 5-10% loss rate from returns, damaged in shipping, or occasional scam. It's part of the business.\n\n**Q: Is the market saturated?** A: Some categories yes (iPhones, popular sneakers). But there are thousands of niches. I focus on Gaming PCs + older electronics that most people don't know the value of. That's where a vintage value checker app really shines - helping you identify hidden gems.\n\n**Q: How do you handle taxes?** A: Track everything. Mileage, purchases, fees, shipping supplies - all deductible. I use my app's in-built inventory tracker + reports. Made $52k revenue last year, profit was $48k after costs, actual taxable income was \\~$42k after deductions. Pay quarterly estimated taxes.\n\n**Bottom Line:**\n\nIf you're looking for a side hustle that:\n\n* Can start with &lt; $100\n* Has legitimate $2-4k/month potential\n* Doesn't require special skills (just learning how to know if something is worth flipping)\n* Gives you flexibility\n\nFlipping/reselling is legit. But you need to be systematic, fast, and data-driven with the right reseller tools. The people making money aren't guessing - they use tools like an AI price checker for resellers to know their numbers cold.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone's interested in trying this or wants to know more about specific aspects (sourcing strategies, platform differences, automation tips, etc.)",

Some are very simple, some are more complicated. More complex projects  might scratch that itch for you. They also tend to pay better. Work is paid hourly and it won’t replace a full time job but it’s decent. The projects I enjoy the best involve writing a very granular “grading rubric” for an AI model’s response and then explaining how several responses fall on that rubric. I find I tend to “lock in” and hyperfocus for that, which is a feeling I enjoy. \n\nI’ve been on the site for about a year so I don’t remember the exact application process, but I was pretty depressed when I first applied so if its too complicated I probably wouldn’t have done it. It does take a couple weeks to get approved and you have to do some unpaid training before you take paid projects, which is annoying, but it’s not a huge time commitment.\n\nThis is my honest opinion of DataAnnotation and I’m not trying to bait anyone into anything, but if you do sign up I’d appreciate you using my referral code: 5CP6QKw",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone. I’m a 23-year-old new graduate in Canada, working full-time in a university administrative role in a sales-adjacent department. While my formal title is coordinator-level, my day-to-day work is closer to first-line operations management.\n\nI currently own my team’s logistics and inventory systems end-to- end. This includes managing physical inventory of giveaway items and company-owned tech assets, maintaining tracking and renewal cycles, managing relationships with external service providers, overseeing a small team of student staff, and having limited budget oversight. My work is very systems-, problem-solving-, and operations-focused rather than creative.\n\nBefore this role, I spent two years as a frontline manager in a student services department while studying full-time. I oversaw \\~30 student staff with hiring responsibility and limited disciplinary authority, had significant budget oversight, managed multiple stakeholder relationships (both as a service provider and as a client), and handled escalations when things broke.\n\nAcross both roles, my strengths are in systems design, process improvement, debugging operational issues, and working with real-world messy constraints. I’m entirely self-taught in this area and don’t have formal business or operations credentials beyond high school business courses.\n\nI’m looking for side hustle ideas that fit around 10 hours per week, require little upfront capital, and ideally have some path to scaling over time. I’m not particularly interested in content creation, design, or social-media-driven businesses. I’m much stronger in technical, analytical, and operations-oriented work, and would prefer to sell a service rather than a product.\n\nI also have some background in tutoring and pedagogy, but I’ve already explored that path and don’t see it as a good long-term fit for me.\n\nI’d appreciate suggestions for side hustles that align with that skill set and constraints.\n\nTIA!",

      "selftext": "Merry Christmas and Happy Hols Passive Incomers, \n\nA year ago I set out to build what I thought would be a passive income stream app for players, charities and myself ofc. The idea was simple - an ad funded lottery/sweepstakes game where you don't need to spend money to play you just watch ads. The napkin math seemed solid $0.02 per ad view in the US x 5 ads per day x 100k players = $10k in prizes per day and 5% for me would be great… I released the app, made a post in this sub that blew up and so I thought I’d follow up after a year. Aside from reading the story which I’ll dump in the comments, I’d really appreciate if you could try the app and give me some classic honest reddit feedback! It’s been a bit of a side hustle but my main business dried up recently and so I either need to go all in on this, or start something new!\n\n[**https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=earn.cash.with.ad.millionaire.maker.lottery.bet**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=earn.cash.with.ad.millionaire.maker.lottery.bet)\n\n**Emojingo on Google Play (classic app)**\n\n[**https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=task.emojingo.app&amp;hl=en\\_US**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=task.emojingo.app&amp;hl=en_US)\n\n**Emojingo Tasks on Google Play (higher earnings per ad view in some countries)**\n\n[**https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emojingo-live-play-the-world/id6738431720**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emojingo-live-play-the-world/id6738431720)\n\n**Emojingo on iOS (can’t cashout via app - need to use web dashboard on emojingo.com)**\n\nHere are the Emojingo basics - each advert you watch (5-30s) adds money to the prize pool and generates a ticket for the daily prize draw that I do in TikTok Live [https://www.tiktok.com/@playemojingo](https://www.tiktok.com/@playemojingo) I then take all the money from the ad views and add it to the prize pool (minus 5% for charity and 5% for me) which I then split with the players every day. Any money that is not won, gets rolled over to the next day so we can get a range of big prizes with lower chance of winning and some smaller daily prizes.  \n  \n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/passive\\_income/comments/1gprs9k/made\\_an\\_ad\\_funded\\_lotterysweepstakes\\_app\\_emojingo/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/comments/1gprs9k/made_an_ad_funded_lotterysweepstakes_app_emojingo/)\n\n**The OG post**  \n  \nI’ll dump the rest of the story in the comments",

          "body": "  \nHere’s the TLDR part:\n\n\n\nI got around 10k players immediately after launch and then got hacked right away - built the first app on the client only, thinking that we could move to server if it took. Moral, if you’re doing anything involving rewards or paying money to people, build it robustly with a server even for the MVP.  \n  \nI started building the user base slowly, thinking everything was covered, but some crafty hackers found the one endpoint that we didn’t lock and started exploiting it very gently so I didn’t notice at first but after a while as I couldn’t figure out why the numbers didn’t add up, I tracked him down. Turns out they had a group somewhere and so a couple of hundred people were using this exploit. When we shut them down, they went and collectively dropped a bunch of 1\\* reviews saying we were a scam and Google took down our app. No appeals helped. Moral, robust server, again  \n  \nWe restarted the app, but this time decided to add Earn into the app title because it performed and into the package name. When we started again, we noticed that our ad rates dropped, spend weeks figuring out why, until finally some random Good Samaritan at an ad network told us that Earn is a trigger warning for ad networks and they’ll either outright ban you or dump your rates. Moral, if you’re incentivising ad views in your app, be careful about it and don’t rub it into the ad networks’ face. \n\n\n\nRight around that time, I experimented with screenshots and used another app’s screenshots as inspiration for Gemini to make something similar - it left a small non-copyrighted bit in, but that was enough for another removal. Moral, be careful if you’re recreating screenshots to make sure nothing gets stuck there.  \n  \nWe somehow managed to get out of that one and the app was reinstated, but then our TikTok randomly got banned and then reinstated. People in the know said that our positioning was very lottery like, even though we don’t take any money and it’s pure ads. Moral, TikTok is super sensitive around gambling so be very careful there. Instagram doesn’t really have our target audience but YouTube is good and I suspect Facebook too. ",

Nothing wrong with that, but you're still capped by hours available. The operators I know who built real passive income did it by solving problems they already understood (usually from their day job) and automating the solution. Takes 12-18 months to see meaningful results, however the income tends to stick around. A common pitfall; chasing whatever's trending rather than playing to your existing knowledge. Your spare time is probably better spent deepening expertise than learning dropshipping from scratch.",

Now I’m looking into trying dropshipping journey to see how this gonna turn out. The only thing about online income is to try and see if is working and then scale it .

          "body": "For me, the only online “hustle” that has consistently worked in my spare time is Attapoll. I’ve been using it for about three months, usually after work or during random downtime, and I’ve made around 60€ in total. It’s not a real side‑income, but it’s been a steady 20€ a month without needing to dedicate actual focused time to it.\n\nWhat made it worthwhile was sticking to short surveys. Anything under ten minutes tends to be reliable, while the longer ones often screen you out halfway through. I also use Google Rewards alongside it, and the small credits from there cover those little 0.99€ or 1.99€ in‑app purchases, which makes it feel like a tiny cashback system running in the background.\n\nI’ve also tried some of the game tasks on Attapoll, and here’s what actually paid out for me:\n\n• **Monopoly GO**    \nThis was the best experience. No ads, smooth progression, and daily events that keep things moving. I earned 14.44€ from it, and it never felt like a chore.\n\n• **Merge games**    \nThese were the worst. They’re packed with ads and progress slows to a crawl unless you sit through endless videos. I usually grab the first easy rewards and uninstall before it becomes a grind.\n\n• **Crypto Miner Tycoon**    \nA pleasant surprise. It’s an idle‑style game with quick daily check‑ins. I made 7.98€ in about five or six days by pushing to the level 5000 milestone, and it never felt like a time sink.\n\nSome tasks even pay instantly just for installing an app, which is obviously the easiest money you can get on there.\n\nA few habits helped me keep things efficient: I cash out as soon as I hit the minimum because payments are fast. I skip surveys that look too long for the payout, since anything over twenty minutes for cents is usually a waste of time. And I keep notifications on because the good surveys disappear quickly. Treating it as a casual side activity rather than something to grind has kept it enjoyable.\n\nOverall, Attapoll has been the only thing that fits naturally into my day without feeling like work. It won’t replace a proper side‑income, but it turns those little pockets of downtime into something mildly productive instead of mindless scrolling. If you want to try it, here’s my referral: [https://attapoll.app/join/idmbj](https://attapoll.app/join/idmbj)",

Also, I can do really well with birthday coupons in my birthday month for free/discounted coffee, cosmetics, toys, meals, etc. the best consistently is Benihana for $30-50 each year for a birthday dinner with similar. Each person in the family can/should sign up for all these apps to “stack” the rewards and have them ready each time you visit. Sometimes, buying a meal for 4 adults at full retail on a Square kiosk also unlocks an instant reward, say $10.

      "selftext": "(Excuse the formatting I'm on mobile)\n\nSo I've been thrown into a really scrappy situation. My father passed away, and I currently don't have a job, and I now live in his apartment. I'm 22, and I don't have a high school diploma. I've tried looking for jobs, but I haven't been getting any callbacks, and everything is very spread out where I live and hard to get to on foot, we also don't have public transportation. Unfortunately, I also think I'm being a bit picky with the jobs I'm wanting but I have mental issues that make interacting with people pretty complicated. I've been looking for remote jobs, too, but im not sure where else to look. So now I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I'm a digital artist, and I crochet. I've tried to make money off of them, but it never seems to stick. Hopefully, someone here can at least point me in the right direction.\n\nEdit: Hi! I really appreciate all the comments people have been leaving and that this is being seen. I just wanna clear up a couple of things really quickly. I've seen a lot of people mention getting my GED, I was in the process of that before my dad passed because he could drive me. But I can't drive, so I have no way to get there. I've looked online for any free GED programs, but as far as I can tell, there aren't any. Maybe this isn't the right sub to be posting on. I'm not sure. But again, thank you for commenting. I'm gonna keep looking for jobs and other things!",

It’s not completely passive income, but it feels pretty close. My products are all digital downloads, like digital stationery, planners, stickers, and so on. I draw some simple designs on my iPad and then use Canva to put everything together. I use AdsPower to manage my shops separately. The income isn’t huge yet, but it’s enough to cover my bills, and I’m already super excited. I just need to put in a bit more time. I really think that as long as you find the right approach, even a competitive niche can work out. \n\nSorry I didn’t share my shop!

I was not trying to build a big brand, just something simple that could run quietly on its own.\n\nHere’s what i did:\n\n* Choose custom ceramic mugs and a few small customizable accessories like key chains and desk items. They are affordable and work well as gifts also people tend to reorder. It also felt like a good option for anyone who wants to start something new without going all in.\n* Used a product designing tool in which I wrote a simple product description and it generated a basic tech pack I could send to manufacturers. That made it much easier to explain sizes, materials, print areas and finish without confusion or multiple revisions.\n* Build everything through Instagram. No ads at the start. I treated it like a small shop and did clear product posts with pinned pricing, highlights answering common questions and real reviews.\n\nOnce I saw repeat questions and orders I simplified everything. Fixed mug sizes, limited options, saved replies and a clear order flow. Now it stopped feeling like daily work and takes very little time to maintain. Orders still come from posts I made months ago. It is not fully passive but gives low stress and actual profit.\n\nHave you started a business this year or are you planning to start one next year? Share experiences and thoughts.\n\n",

Everything I found was either buggy or way too expensive for what I needed (most “affordable” tools are still $20–$50/month for basic stuff). So I said screw it, built my own version in a day, and shared it.​\n\nPeople started calling it “the most affordable feedback tool on the internet”. Someone paid, then another… and now there are 9 paying users at a very dumb, very simple price: **1$/month per site**. So right now it’s literally 9 users → 9$/month.\n\nWhat feels crazy to me is not the money, but the timing. TrustMRR stats show that going from 0 → first dollar usually takes around 5 months on average, and I hit that “0 to 1” in a day with a side project.​\n\nA few things this taught me already:\n\n* Scratching your own itch is still underrated.\n* Charging *something* beats waiting for “the perfect launch”.\n* Simple pricing lowers the mental barrier for both builder and buyer.\n\nHappy to answer any questions about how the 9 users came in, pricing, stack, etc.",

(Passive: money works for you.)\n\n• Rental property income (with property manager): Buy property, hire management; collect rent checks ongoing. (Passive after setup.)\n\n• Royalties from a book/ebook – Write and publish once (e.g., on Amazon KDP); earn royalties on every sale forever.\n\n• Online course sales – Create and upload a course once (e.g., on Udemy or Teachable); earn from enrollments with no further work\n\n• Affiliate marketing website/blog – Build a site with evergreen content and affiliate links; earn commissions from traffic/sales over years.\n\n• YouTube channel ad revenue – Upload videos that stay relevant; earn from ads, sponsorships, and views long-term (after hitting monetization).\n• Peer-to-peer lending interest – Lend money via platforms like LendingClub; earn interest automatically as borrowers repay.\n\n• App or software license sales – Develop an app once and sell/distribute it (e.g., on app stores); earn from downloads/subscriptions.\n\n• Digital product sales (printables, stock photos, templates) – Create once and sell unlimited copies on Etsy or your site.\n• High-yield savings or CD interest – Deposit money in interest-bearing accounts; earn passively with zero effort.\n• Domain name parking/flipping – Buy valuable domains and park them with ads or sell later for profit.\n\nClicking vague links from sketchy folks phishing for morons here 24/7 will NOT lead you to success in passive income. \n",

          "body": "I was exactly where you are 24 days ago. Most people will tell you to do surveys or micro-tasks for $10/day, but that’s just trading your life for pocket change.\n\nI’m currently on Day 24 of a $0 to $10k/month challenge using pure organic traffic (no ads). Here is what I’ve learned about the '$10/day' mindset:\n\n1. **Don't 'Work' for $10, Build for it:** If you spend 2 hours a day on a survey, you get $10 once. If you spend 2 hours building a Pinterest or Reddit presence, that content stays online and works for you 24/7.\n2. **The 'Leaky Bucket' Problem:** I just discovered I was 'leaking' traffic. I had 105 clicks to offers but $0 revenue because I wasn't capturing emails first. $10/day comes easily once you fix your 'routing.'\n3. **Start with Value:** Pick a niche you know, post helpful data on Reddit or Quora, and link to a resource.\n\nI’m documenting every failure and pivot of my 90-day build-in-public journey on my profile. It’s currently at $0, but the 'plumbing' is now doing 18k views. Happy to show you the 'architecture' if you want to see how to aim higher than $10!",

A few directions you could explore depending on your interests and skills:\nFreelance digital services: design, copywriting, social media management, or content creation.\nBuilding your own small online business: simple ecom, info products, or niche digital tools.\nProviding local services in Dubai evenings/weekends: tutoring, consulting, or small logistics gigs.\nCurious, do you prefer something fully online you can scale later, or something hands-on locally that earns fast?

You already understand shipping workflows, which is a big advantage. Check Upwork / Fiverr but position yourself as operations support, not “VA.”\n* Local service arbitrage:Dubai has high demand for cleaning, moving, handyman, car detailing, etc. You don’t do the work — you just: run ads, handle WhatsApp inquiries, book jobs, take a margin, Very doable evenings/weekends.\n* B2B outreach for small companies:Many SMEs here are terrible at email/LinkedIn outreach. Learning basic cold email + lead lists can turn into a retainer side income within a few months.\n* Longer-term (not passive at first): digital products or contentIf your goal is “something of your own,” build in public slowly (blog, X, Reddit) around a niche you actually know (shipping, expat life, ops, logistics). Monetization comes later.\nBiggest advice: Avoid anything marketed as “passive” upfront. Almost nothing is. Focus on skills or leverage first, then make it passive later.",

I just said that cus that is where I am I dunno how much I'm Australian or whatever. The second one is three times longer so 72 days 3 hours a day or half that at 6 hours a day take a $350 test and that puts you in the $150,000 to $220,000 a year range after your third year of work. So he puts a ceiling of 220,000 and then you get a job making $50 to $90 and then you get that cert while you're working that 50 to 90 job and within 2 years you're going to be making $150k to $220k as a junior and senior level worker  and it sounds crazy but your second second cert lets you become eventually a senior level worker in that field and it usually takes like 3 years to become a senior level. You'd be a junior level associate like in a year and a half to 2 years and then by year three you could be making senior level pay which is $220 plus stock options and benefits. But the tech industry needs millions of people right now because of AI. And you don't need to have any computer knowledge to take these certs or to start learning them. No computer knowledge, no code knowledge, no math. It's ridiculous. It's like a dream come true to be honest",

      "selftext": "Hello, I am a college sophomore in need of passive income to sustain my needs, and I also want to help my family pay the bills. I have $34 (₱2,000 PHP) every week as an allowance, and I rent a room (a bed spacer) in the city since I live far from my university. I am in charge of my food and other necessities, and I don’t want to bother my parents with additional school fees because they are already paying for my room, my tuition, and giving me an allowance every week. I do not wish to add to their burden anymore.\n\nTo be honest, I barely eat sometimes just so I can save money for school supplies and fees. There are days when I choose to skip meals because I know there will be expenses coming up, and I don’t want to ask for more. I try to stretch what little I have as much as I can.\n\nI can’t find any jobs online, and I can’t work at fast-food restaurants since my schedule is very loaded. I also can’t do physical labor because of my poor physical health. I am a regular university student, but I think I can make time at night and cut some of my study sessions to work. I am very eager to find a side hustle, but I can’t seem to get hired.\n\nHow do people actually find online side hustles? What are some side hustles you can suggest for someone in my situation? Any tips or advice would really mean a lot..",

Let me explain\n\nI'm junior account &amp;  just want to make some extra money for Christmas, I already had this workflow built but just for financial news. Its connected to Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok &amp; various other news outlets &amp; social media platforms. Then it alerts me of new stories before they hit the big platforms.\n\nThree months ago I started using my workflow to take trades on polymarket, thus this post. Its been fruitful so far. I get alerts on underreported news &amp; place trades on outcomes before the market reacted &amp; that's about it. Its not a sure fire method in the slightest, nor is it something super lucrative, &amp; it is risky as I often have to filter out fake news but it has been helpful as far as side hustles go.\n\nNow, I'm sure some of you are aware that this isn't exactly passive but I will be using this month to fix that issue. I'm currently working on making the workflow place the trades for me as well. Once this is done &amp; tested, I'll share an update.\n\nWhat i really wanted to share with you guys is that you should overlook the simple things, you never know, a simple system you use could be a money maker under different circumstances.\n\nAlso I apologize if this is super short, I really dont know how to explain, but feel free to ask questions &amp; ill try to answer as much as possible.",

      "selftext": "# Pinterest Final Ban Updates\n\nMost people quit affiliate marketing because they don't see results fast enough.\n\nI'm documenting why there are no results so you can learn from my mistakes.\n\n**Day 26 Stats:**\n\n**Digistore24:**\n\n* Clicks: 116\n* Order form visits: 13 (11% conversion from click to checkout)\n* Sales: 0\n* Revenue: $0\n\n**PartnerStack:**\n\n* Promo clicks: 116\n* New partnerships: 6\n* Earnings: $0\n\n**What happened this week:**\n\nGot banned from Pinterest at 93.5K views for \"spam\" (aka posting affiliate links with full disclosure).\n\nPivoted to Reddit. Got 12,000 views per day. Reddit offered me $500 in free ads.\n\n**The problem I'm diagnosing:**\n\nTraffic isn't the issue. I'm getting clicks.\n\nThe issue: **Only 11% of clicks make it to checkout. And 0% actually buy.**\n\n**What I'm testing this week:**\n\n1. Switching from high-ticket ($500+) to mid-ticket ($100-300) offers\n2. A/B testing product selection (maybe I'm promoting the wrong stuff)\n3. Analyzing landing page experience (is the checkout process killing conversions?)\n4. Using Reddit's $500 ad credit to test paid vs. organic traffic quality\n\n**Why I'm posting this:**\n\nBecause everyone shows you the wins. Nobody shows you Day 26 at $0 revenue with a platform ban and a broken funnel.\n\nIf you're struggling with affiliate conversions, you're not alone.\n\nIf you've been banned from a platform for \"spam\" while promoting legitimate products, you're not alone.\n\nIf you're wondering whether this whole affiliate thing actually works... I'll let you know in 64 days.\n\n**Question for experienced affiliates:**\n\n11% click-to-checkout rate but 0% checkout-to-sale rate. Is this a product problem, a trust problem, or a traffic quality problem?\n\nDrop your thoughts. I'm testing everything.",

My logic is that since the LTV is high and our overhead is capped, I’d rather give the lion's share to the person who brought the customer in, creating a \"sticky\" partnership.\nFor the experienced affiliate marketers here:\nDoes 60% sound \"too good to be true\"? Does a commission that high actually scare away professional affiliates because they think the business isn't sustainable?\n\nWe use Whop for our backend to ensure transparent tracking/payouts. In your experience, do affiliates prefer 3rd-party platforms like Whop? \n\nIf you were a small creator, what would you need to see besides the commission? (e.g., Live data audits, \"swipe files,\" \"documents/white paper\" or a free account to verify the tool ourselves?)\n\nI'm trying to build this lean and partner-focused.

Paid ads are expensive and going after small creators with engaged audiences is a great idea. \n\nTo answer your question, you won't know until you try. \n\n60% is generous. But I've had brands offer us $500 CPA (for account creation, for example). \n\nThe amount you offer is irrelevant -- all that matters is the CVR. So don't spend too much time now worrying about your offer. Get it out in front of as many affiliates as you can, and they will negotiate, reject you, or try it out. \n\nThe game doesn't really start until they have the live offer and are able to measure the CVR. \n\nFor the record, I plan on copying your approach (for LATAM market) and won't even bother with rev share.

Out of curiosity, I started digging into Alibaba to see what the actual manufacturing cost looked like. After a decent amount of research into suppliers, reviews, and verifying the manufacturer, I pulled the trigger on one unit.\n\nWhen it arrived, I was honestly expecting stereotypical cheap Chinese knockoff quality. But it wasn’t. The build quality was on par with the name-brand US versions I’d been comparing it to.\n\nJust for fun, I threw it up on Facebook Marketplace to see if there was any interest. The response surprised me. My all-in cost including shipping was around $1,200. Comparable products were selling locally for $2,500+. I had multiple inquiries within days.\n\nSo now I’m testing it for real. Bought a few more units, planning to flip them. If it works, I’ll open an LLC and do everything above board.\nHere’s where my background helps: I work in logistics, so I’ve been able to optimize shipping and cut some costs that I think most people wouldn’t know how to avoid. I’m wondering if that gives me a legitimate edge, or if this whole space is so saturated that margins get crushed the moment you try to scale.\n\nMy questions for this community:\n\n\t∙\tIs the “Alibaba to local resale” model played out, or are there still niches where this works?\n\t∙\tDid I just get lucky with this particular product category, or is there a repeatable process here?\n\t∙\tFor those who’ve done this: what’s the capital requirement to actually make it a real business vs. a side hustle?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s tried this, whether it worked or didn’t. Not looking for validation; just trying to figure out if this is worth pursuing seriously or if I should just enjoy the quick wins and move on.",

          "body": "I do a ton of sourcing and importing as a service. I work with basically the future version of you, companies who already have sales to justify volume. Just for context anyway.\n\n\\- Is Alibaba to local played out?\n\nNo. But it's less about the business structure and more about what type of product actually sells locally, is there used versions available locally, and how to play it off. For some products, yes, it's played out. Maybe not having anything to do with it coming from Alibaba, vs maybe just there is a lot of competition on Marketplace with just used ones. Or, there just isn't the demand. Be careful with just getting interest. Marketplace is natorious for tons of people asking if it's still available, but not ultimately selling it. I don't know why, just how people behave on the platform.\n\n\n\n\\- Did you get lucky?\n\nI guess I wouldn't know. I don't know that luck has much to do with business. You took a chance and it paid off (Assuming it sold, I didn't catch if it did or not)\n\n\n\n\\- Is there a repeatable process?\n\nI'm assuming you mean, can you repeat this with other products? The answer is basically the first question. It depends on your local dynamics. \n\n  \n\\- Is there a real business here?\n\nNo, it's a side hustle. It won't scale. Meaning, to make more money, you have to work harder. There is very little you can do to change that. And you will have to continue essentially finding entirely new products to take that chance on as the old ones get local market saturation.\n\n That's not to say it's  not worth pursuing for the fun, experience and maybe side cash. But what this does do is ties your time and money up on something with limited potential. If you don't have a lot of entrepreneurial dreams, this is fine. But if you do have those dreams, aside from this being a good learning experience, it's what will keep you from those dreams. It absolutely will hold your entrepreurial dreams back if you ever wanted to have something less side hustle and more full on scalable business.\n\n\n\n\\- Does your logistics background help?\n\nAbsolutely. A lot of people that get into reselling, regardless of the platform. They have cost prohibitive freight costs. If you have solved that problem, you are ahead of the curve no matter what you do. It essentially adds a layer of competitive advantage on landed cost. At least as far as you can have with shipping so few. But judging by the price point, I am assuming the CBM is relatively large. Meaning shipping just a few can still be above the first tier of economies of scale. Of course if you ship a whole container at once, or at least the more CBM the lower the cost. But if your outlet is marketplace, that probably isn't a possibility. Then it becomes filling that CBM with multiple different products. But honestly, I don't see that being a good business if your outlet is just market place. You might be better off actually starting a brand where you have a site and try to get distribution. Just the larger the item, the harder that gets because of the then shippng cost to the end user. But, still maybe worth looking into.\n\n\n\n\\- LLC?\n\nNo, don't do this until you have proven there is enough sales to justify. You are selling on a platform known for buying used things. You are selling them as an individual. You don't have nearly the level of reason to protect yourself as someone really needing that LLC or whatever structure. Of course you still report the income as pass-through, so you are legit enough. If you go into selling serious volume, then yes. But at this level, it's a hard not-worth-it.",

It works for sure, but the real question is how long you gonna stay ahead.\n\nThis thing is super saturated, so finding a niche is something you hold close to your chest. There’s a ton of VA’s  and full time resellers who literally spend all day scrolling Facebook Marketplace looking for the exact same deals you’re chasing.\n\nHere’s what usually happens. You’ll knock out five units quick at $2,500 each and feel like you just discovered fire. Then all of a sudden nothing moves. Next thing you know, the same item shows up from somebody else at $2,300. You drop yours to $2,200 to keep selling. They go lower. You go lower again.\n\nPretty soon you’re in a full on race to the bottom and eating your own profits.\n\nSo your real edge is gonna be that logistical experience on the import side. Mind if I ask you some questions regarding logistics? \n\nWhen ordering from Alibaba and scaling up, what are some of the specific tricks you’re using to keep shipping and import costs low that most beginners totally miss? Like smarter freight choices, consolidation, duty stuff, or anything else that’s actually saving you money and helping protect those margins?\n\nInterested in learning more. I had a product idea on a small niche plastic product but hesitant because I need to order 5000 min units. I work in AI first Digital marketing, happy to trade info if you need anything :)",

I don’t have friendships. I don’t have that university life where people talk, hang out, and share experiences Most of my time I just sit doing nothing I feel empty and far away from people my age.\nI started thinking maybe I should use the money to study abroad (I’m in Saudi) on my own just to “live” and not waste my youth but at the same time I need to manage the car wash.\nAny advice from entrepreneurs who’ve been through something like this? Or had that same sense of emptiness? What would you do if you were in my position?",

Most of the times the feeling passes but if it lingers you may need to think inward and explore what your true passions are in life and pursue them. \n\nI went from climbing and cutting to management lately and grew very unhappy and complacent in work and life. Always feeling like something was missing. I found out that went away when I actually got out and did tree work which is my passion. I did more exploring within myself and realized I love helping others so I started another tree service (non-profit) that helps people at subsidized or no cost. \n\nIn conclusion, find out what you have a true passion for whether it’s in work or a hobby and let that bring you fulfillment and joy. The car wash may just be income but don’t give up on it. If you can find joy in other parts of your life the negative feelings about the car wash will go away. From one stranger to another I am incredibly proud of you for starting a business and I wish you success!\n\nYou need to travel. This will help some of the feelings you have but don’t lose sight of your business. Also, consider getting a mentor or a psychologist/therapist. This can help sort through your thoughts and come to your own conclusions. See the car wash through, scale it, hire employees that can run it without you but don’t stop managing the business. You’ve made a commitment to your dad and yourself. See it through.",

Obviously, you want to save up a reserve of cash and pay down your loan (early, if you can) but also maybe save up to purchase your next business or expand your existing one.  If people are waiting for their car to get washed, you have a captive audience so you might be able to add retail like coffee, juice, snacks, car accessories, etc.  \n\nAlso, I don't know how it is in Saudi, but in the US as a business owner your are part of a special club of business owners.  Other business owners will likely talk to you and treat you as an equal.  Go around to the businesses near you (and any others you are interested in) and ask for the owner and introduce yourself.  Say \"My name is Joe Bob and I own the car wash down the street and I just wanted to introduce myself.\"  You will probably be surprised that they will likely be happy to show you around their business and talk business with you, even direct competitors.  You can make a lot of friends this way and do a lot of business networking.  Also, try to get to know the owners of your suppliers if they are local or find local suppliers whose owners you can know personally.\n\nAnd you can hang out with your employees, just try to keep business separate.

Finally, the Uni lifestyle thing is great, but it's really lots of young people havibg lots of spare time &amp; you do not sound like a person who wants to sit around all day chatting. More power to you. Some of us are busy bees &amp; some are not. You are &amp; just get some interests/activities apart from the car wash &amp; I think you will be happier. Good luck.",

We added an \"AI/LLM Recommendation\" option to the \"How did you find us?\" question.\n\n**Two months later, nearly 30% of our new users were selecting that option.**\n\nWe realized that while we were fighting for keywords on the App Store, our actual users were just asking Claude or ChatGPT for specific recommendations. We’ve started calling it **LMO (Language Model Optimization)** internally. It’s definitely not mainstream yet, but here is exactly what we changed to make the AIs \"like\" us:\n\n**1. We started \"feeding\" the communities** We realized LLMs are basically scraping Reddit (r/cycling, r/bicycling), bike forums, and Quora for \"truth.\" So, instead of just posting on our own dev blog, we started heavily contributing in these communities. We noticed a direct correlation: the more we were mentioned in actual human conversations about \"alternatives to X\" or \"battery friendly apps,\" the more ChatGPT started recommending us.\n\n**2. We started writing content for robots, not just humans** We stopped with the flashy \"Ride Beyond Limits\" marketing slogans. LLMs love structure and literal facts. We updated our website and press kit to be super literal:\n\n* *Exactly what sensors we support (HRM, Cadence, Power)*\n* *Exactly how our battery usage compares to the big guys*\n* *Explicit statements on our privacy policy (No data selling)*\n\nWe basically gave the AI the \"context\" it needs to understand exactly where to file us in its database.\n\n**3. We planted \"memory seeds\"** We started posting content specifically designed to be indexed by these models.\n\n* Comparison tables on our blog (Us vs. The Big Competitors) regarding feature sets.\n* Documentation that links our app name with specific long-tail keywords like \"offline GPX export\" or \"commuter tracking.\"\n* Guest posts on cycling tech blogs that we know are in the training data.\n\n**4. We answered the questions people actually ask AI** We reverse-engineered what cyclists type into ChatGPT. Instead of targeting short keywords like \"bike app,\" we put exact match questions on our site:\n\n* *\"What is the best free cycling app without a subscription?\"*\n* *\"Which bike tracker drains the least battery?\"*\n* *\"How to track rides without sharing location data?\"*\n\nWhen you provide the direct answer to a direct question, the AI seems to prioritize your info as the \"correct\" answer.\n\n**The Result:** We stopped sweating over Google updates or App Store algorithms. Now, when you ask the major LLMs specifically about *\"Best privacy-focused bike tracker\"* or *\"Simple cycling apps for commuters,\"* we show up about half the time.\n\nWe’ve even had our team test this via VPNs and incognito windows to make sure it wasn't just personalized result and it holds up.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to dump this here in case it helps any other devs trying to figure out where their traffic is coming from. Happy to share the actual content calendar framework we use if people are interested in a Part 2.",

One of the best advice I’ve seen! \n\nI’d suggest some more technical LMO tips:\n\nAI agents are increasingly indexing websites using a new standard called llms.txt\n\nhttps://llmstxt.org\n\nYou provide two text files at root of your site. One listing all links and another to provide the entire content of site as a compressed text file. \n\nHere is an example:\n\nhttps://gofastmcp.com/llms.txt\n\nhttps://gofastmcp.com/llms-full.txt\n\nThis ensures agents can easily index your site. \n\nAnother tip is to try asking questions about your business in chatbots and see which queries they build to run against a web search tool.

      "selftext": "I just finished watching Alex's new \"26 Lessons\" video. It’s long, but honestly, there were some gems in there that hit pretty hard. I took notes for myself and figured I’d drop them here to save you guys the time.\n\nHere you go:\n\n**On Mindset &amp; Psychology**\n\n* **Fear lives in the vague.** If you’re scared, write down the absolute worst-case scenario in detail. Usually, it’s just \"sleeping on a friend's couch,\" not dying. Once it’s on paper, it’s not scary.\n* **Mental Toughness &gt; Motivation.** He breaks toughness down into: How much bad stuff can you take? How low do you get? How fast do you bounce back? And do you come back better?\n* **The \"Heavyweight Champion\" move is doing nothing.** When someone insults you or triggers you, your gut wants to punish them. But usually, doing nothing is the only move that actually gets you what you want (them going away).\n* **Think for yourself.** Most people are just picking \"identity packages\" off the shelf (Hipster, Redneck, etc) and adopting those beliefs. If you can't explain why you believe something, it's not your thought.\n* **It's okay to just make money.** Don't fall for the \"Third Marshmallow\" trap where you delay gratification until you're dead. At some point, you have to reap what you sowed.\n\n**On Business Strategy &amp; Growth**\n\n* **No \"New\" Stuff.** New is risky. The hierarchy is: Do **More** of what works &gt; Do it **Better** \\&gt; Do something **New** (only as a last resort). He only allows himself one new big project a year.\n* **Plan life first.** Once you have money, you’re paid for judgment, not hours. So prioritize sleep and an empty calendar. Let business fill the cracks, not the other way around.\n* **Ignorance isn't a defense.** Learn the laws and contracts. \"Lawyer stuff\" eats your brainpower if you don't understand the rules of the game.\n* **The Founder's Will.** The biggest risk isn't running out of cash, it's the founder just not wanting to do it anymore. You need a \"why\" that survives past the point where the money is \"enough.\"\n\n**On Team &amp; Leadership (The harsh truths)**\n\n* **The Leader is always the problem.** If a department sucks, the leader sucks. Period.\n* **A-Players or nothing.** You know if someone is an A-Player in the first 14 days. If you don't know by then, they aren't one. Cut them.\n* **A-Players hate B-Players.** If you keep mediocre people, your stars will leave.\n* **Hard conversations save millions.** If you can't have a tough talk when stakes are low (contracts), you guarantee a lawsuit when stakes are high.\n* **Delegation is painful.** The spiritual path of entrepreneurship is constantly giving up control. \"Scale Zero\" means if a task requires you, it’s broken.\n\n**On Marketing &amp; Brand**\n\n* **The Offer is King.** You can't out-market a bad offer. A good offer makes people feel stupid saying no. (Razor: Can you pitch it in a text message and get a \"yes\"? If not, it's too complex).\n* **Clear &gt; Clever.** No one is listening. You have to repeat yourself until you die.\n* **Brand is the Moat.** In an AI world, execution is commoditized. Who people trust is the only defense. Give away the secrets, sell the implementation.\n* **Volume wins.** You need thousands of ad creatives. He used like 5,000 variations for his book launch.\n\nP.S. Add yours - let's make a mega thread which is packed with value for all.",

Customers would make less impulsive purchases. It slows the whole system down for the store as there is a choke point. More product returns. If you look at grocery, it's mostly large chains with few employees and instead it's the distributers stocking the shelves, and that's why you can't get someone to help you and when they do they said \"i don't work here, sorry.\"  Grocery is mostly a real estate business today. An exception is Trader Joes which is a completely different model but you still pick it yourself. Incidentally, trading stores in the US worked the way you describe in 1800s before the modern grocery store was invented. You would go to the counter and tell the man what you wanted to buy. If you are interested in this topic, there's an episode of the Acquired podcast about Trader Joes that is fascinating.",

          "body": "I don’t think it’ll be long before concepts like this do start to take significant market share in the U.S.  Right now there’s a slight tech bottleneck, in my opinion, making it cost prohibitive. Staying out of stores and doing the pickup option for convenience became very popular during Covid, but near the end of Covid, people were ready to get out and back into stores. This divided customer base made omnichannel shopping far more important. People appreciated the option to walk around and browse, but there were some people who wanted to strictly purchase what they wanted and needed without the hassle of going into stores and possibly buying things they didn’t intend impulsively. \n\nAll this leads me to believe that AR/VR shopping is going to be a big middle ground once the tech catches up and becomes convenient enough for consumers to wear the displays and shop either with AR rendered 3D models in their own homes or via a full VR shopping experience where the customer could effectively “pilot” a robot shopper to walk the aisles and shop. Then, to save on labor costs, items that are purchased with be picked and packed by other robotics either for pickup or delivery. Amazon has had a patent on a massive drone warehouse for a while now where the orders would be picked and shipped from this warehouse blimp via drone delivery. So I think that’s part of the puzzle as well.",

      "selftext": "I've seen hundreds of pitch decks, met dozens of founders in 2025, and made dozens of pitch decks. Talked to many investors and asked their insights about pitch decks for whole year. Here is what I learned this year:\n\n1. **The problem slide is where you win or lose.** If an investor doesn't lean forward on slide 2, the rest doesn't matter. Most founders bury their best insight on slide 8.\n2. **Founders who've experienced the problem they're solving tell better stories.** Personal connection &gt; market research every single time.\n3. **The \"platform\" word is poison.** I removed it from at least 10 decks this year. Just tell me what the thing actually does.\n4. **Traction without context is useless.** \"10K users\" means nothing. \"10K users, 23% MoM growth, $47 average revenue per user\" means something.\n5. **Most market size slides are bullshit, and investors know it.** TAM/SAM/SOM with numbers pulled from Statista doesn't impress anyone. Show me YOUR math based on YOUR customer segments.\n6. **Financial projections are fiction, but they reveal how you think.** Show you understand unit economics and investors will forgive aggressive growth assumptions. Show hockey sticks with no underlying logic and investors will assume you don't know your business.\n7. **The team slide should answer \"why you, why now.\"** Your advisor's LinkedIn profile doesn't matter. Your 10 years solving this exact problem does.\n8. **Asking for money without showing what milestones is just amateur.** \"We need $2M for hiring and marketing\" isn't a plan. \"$2M gets us to $100K MRR and 18-month runway\" is.\n9. **Design matters less than founders think, but more than they act like it does.** Your deck doesn't need to be gorgeous, but it can't look like you don't give a shit.\n10. **Every deck should answer: what's the insight only you have?** If I could've thought of your idea without domain expertise, it's not compelling enough.\n11. **Slide count doesn't matter.** Based on my experience and Carta's insights, there's no correlation between slide number and fundraising success. If a slide is meaningful, keep it. If a slide is just \"nice to have,\" remove it.\n12. **Founders confuse features with benefits.** \"AI-powered matching algorithm\" doesn't mean shit to anyone. \"Cuts hiring time from 60 days to 12\" does.\n13. **The fundraising story matters as much as the business story.** Why this round, why this amount, why now etc. If you can't articulate it clearly, investors smell desperation.\n14. **The decks that got funded weren't perfect but they were clear.** Clarity beats cleverness every single time.\n15. **Nobody reads Slide 1 (Cover slide).** They glance at it for 3 seconds. If your tagline is a paragraph, you've already lost.\n16. **\"AI\" is a feature, not a business.** In Q1 2025, slapping \"AI\" on a slide worked. Now? It's noise. Tell me what problem you solve, not what tech stack you use.\n17. **The \"Conservative Estimate\" Lie.** We know your Year 5 projection of $100M ARR is fake. You know it's fake. Focus on how you get the first $1M instead of giving huge promises.\n18. **One idea per slide.** I see founders trying to cram the Problem, Solution, and Market Size onto one slide to \"save space.\" Don't. It looks like a random note.\n19. **Your TAM is wrong.** If you claim your Total Addressable Market is \"The Global Internet,\" you don't know who your customer is. Niche down.\n20. **Font size 10 is illegal.** If an investor has to squint to read your LTV/CAC ratio on a mobile screen, they're closing the file.\n21. **Bullet points are boring.** Use icons, use charts, use big numbers. Walls of text are for legal contracts, not pitch decks.\n22. **Stop using \"Uber for X.\"** It's almost 2026. Come up with your own category.\n23. **The Appendix is your best friend.** Keep the main deck short and tell your story clearly. Put the technical deep dives in the appendix.\n24. **PDF is the only format.** Don't send a Keynote. Don't send a PPT. Fonts break. Layouts shift. Send a PDF.\n25. **Your \"Exit Strategy\" is presumptuous.** You haven't sold one unit yet. Don't tell me about your IPO plans.\n26. **Data needs context.** Don't just show a graph going up. Label the axes. Explain the spike. Everybody love labeled axes.\n27. **Consistency signals competence.** If your headers jump around and your colors shift slightly, investors subconsciously think your code is messy too.\n28. **Frameworks kill the story.** Most founders try to use famous frameworks. But those frameworks push founders to be standard. Instead of this, create your own story.\n29. **Competition slide is your positioning.** Everybody knows you cannot compete with Google, Apple, OpenAI or other big corporates. But you really can focus a niche and grow in a vertical. You don't have to write a complex competition slide. X-Y landscape is great but you have to choose the right X and Y angles and be perfect on your niche.\n30. **Don't separate \"Why Now\" into its own slide.** Weave it naturally into your problem (it's urgent), market (it's shifting), and competition (giants are slow). When \"why now\" is isolated, it feels forced.\n\n**My predictions for 2026:**\n\n**AI will review your deck before humans do.** I've talked to investors and many of them are already using AI reviews, custom GPTs, Claude, Gemini on their emails. Your pitch deck isn't just for humans anymore. You need to explain your business to AI too. Find the balance: clear enough for AI to understand, compelling enough for humans to care.\n\n**Pre-seed rounds will get harder.** Building an MVP is easier than ever thanks to AI. So investors are asking for revenue or real traction even at pre-seed, and their bar will keep rising. My advice? Generate traction first, fundraise later -when it is possible of course. (And possible doesn't mean \"if you have money\", it means \"if it is possible as technical\")\n\n**Investor outreach will be noisier than ever.** Automation tools are everywhere now. Anyone can build a bulk email campaign to investors. Standing out will require actual creativity, not just another cold email template. The spray-and-pray approach is literally dead.",

          "body": "Great list. As a VC, there are 3 critical slides that are either missing or weak in almost every deck I see right now.\n\n1. The \"Why Now\" (Beyond just \"AI\") Every single deck in 2025 says \"Why Now? -&gt; Because GenAI made it possible.\" While true, it is no longer a differentiator. It’s table stakes. I see 50 decks a week claiming this. To stand out, you need a second-order \"Why Now.\" Is there a regulatory shift? A generational behavior change? A collapse of a legacy incumbent's business model? If your only catalyst is \"LLMs exist,\" you are competing with everyone.\n\n2. Distribution &gt; Product Most founders spend 10 slides on the product and 1 generic slide saying \"We will do SEO and Ads.\" In 2026, building product is easy (thanks to AI). Distribution is the hard part. I don't care how pretty the UI is; show me you understand how to acquire a customer for $1 before you extract $3.\n\n3. \"Pain Validation\" with Real Data Don't just tell me the market is big. Prove the pain is acute. Market research reports are nice, but your own data is king. Show me the results of 50 customer interviews. Better yet show me a \"Fake Door\" test where you ran $100 of ads to a landing page describing the problem. Did they click? Did they try to sign up? \"We think people want this\" &lt; \"We have a 3% CTR on cold traffic targeting this specific pain point.\"",

The AI point is interesting too, we already feel that pressure writing things so systems and reviewers don’t misinterpret them.",

A lot of founders are still building decks for how fundraising used to work, not how it works now.\n\nTwo things I would add from recent conversations:\n\nFirst, investors are pattern matching faster than ever. That makes clarity even more important. If your insight is not obvious in the first two slides, you do not get the benefit of the doubt anymore. The deck is no longer a conversation starter. It is a filter.\n\nSecond, distribution thinking is starting to leak into decks. I have seen more investors ask “how do you get your first 100 customers” instead of “how big is the market.” Founders who can explain one repeatable acquisition motion get taken more seriously than founders with beautiful TAM math.\n\nStrong callout on AI reviewing decks too. I have seen partners admit they skim AI summaries before opening the PDF. If your story is not legible to a machine, it probably is not legible to a tired human either.\n\nOverall takeaway I agree with: decks do not need to be impressive. They need to be precise.",

I have a background in business storytelling and presentations and have thought about starting a side business helping founders uncover and effectively communicate their story. A couple questions: 1) Does a storytelling approach help founders connect on an emotional level with investors and therefore lead to more success? I.e. if you lean in to problem/conflict/emotion/story, is that what pulls in the potential investor, vs going granular on product features, etc.? Or do investors mainly care about the numbers? 2) I have recommended presenters create two decks - a presentation deck (minimal text, more visual) and a leave behind deck that summarizes the presentation and can be consumed on its own. Do you consider that a best practice? Or with AI reviewing decks first, do you need to have just one deck?",

We had a clear contract, milestones, everything seemed professional. Delivered the final version three weeks ago, client approved everything, paid the final invoice. Since then ive gotten probably 8 emails asking for quick changes or one small adjustment that would only take a few minutes. First it was changing some button colors. Then it was adding a new section to the homepage. Then it was reworking the entire navigation menu because they had a better idea. Each time I politely remind them that the project is complete and any additional work would require a new contract or hourly rate. The thing is, these small changes add up. Ive probably spent another 4-5 hours total on these requests because I feel guilty saying no, but now im realizing im just working for free and setting a bad precedent. How do you guys handle this without damaging the relationship? I want to be firm but also don't want them leaving bad reviews or telling people I'm difficult to work with. Im also dealing with some annoying admin stuff right now since im based internationally and trying to get a proper commercial address sorted for my US business setup.

That's a huge milestone.\n\n\n\nFor the documentation/invoicing:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Quick wins:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Use Wave or FreshBooks (both have free tiers) - they generate professional invoices in 5 minutes. Include: invoice number, your business details, itemized breakdown of services, payment terms (Net 30 is standard for corporate), total.\n\n\n\n\\- For what you spent their money on: Create a simple expense report in Google Sheets.

AI has been immensely helpful in keeping our team lean and moving faster as a small team! People are often surprised when we say we only have 2 engineers! That said, below is a list of what worked and what did not\n\n**What worked**\n\n1. **Writing Code got 2x faster atleast:** Thanks to tools like Cursor, Windsurf etc, our team is shipping code atleast 2x faster! Metrics like DORA clearly show this but more important, its super obvious because our product roadmap for the whole year was done in the the 2nd quarter!\n2. **50% marketing is on autopilot:** Our primary marketing channel is Google ads and I still do everything manually but there were a lot of smaller marketing tasks like SEO and social media content we have been juggling with using freelancers years! Thanks to AI tools like Frizerly and stuff, all of this is completely automated now! I just spend 5 mins reviewing content every week now\n3. **Design:** Tools like Google Nano Banana, V0 by Vercel has completely taken over designs for us. AI is able to take existing simple images, UI etc and transform it into the exact ones we want! Since you can basically chat with these, iteration speed is insane!\n4. **Translation:** Lastly, we were hiring translators again as freelancers earlier because our specific business has a lot of translation requirements often! AI has been able to completely automate this again\n\n**What did not work for us**\n\n1. **Personalized outreach:** We tried outreach via LinkedIn and email using AI personalization tools but our customers hated it!\n2. **AI support:** We connected our support chat/ticket system with AI in the hopes of faster resolution and lower overall human support load! But for some reason, again our customers hate it. We kept seeing messages like \"I WANT HUMAN\" lol! So we quickly removed it\n\nFollowing to see  what everyone else experiences have been like :)",

          "body": "What did help us a lot;  \n\\- Translation in a true local tone of voice got much easier. We have a multilingual content publishing platform and the automated translations are almost always spot on. Its great you can add context and tone of voice prompts with every bit of translation. Quality has gotten up by a terrible lot and time to review very much down. \n\n\\- We sell products and a new product section \"what do actual clients say\" is way better now I can summarize all reviews into one good one. New customers like this new created content block a lot and the results make a lot of sense. So instead of reading 100 reviews most customers read that piece of content. \n\nIn 2026 we're going to do the same with \"what our experts say\" and just do a survey among all our experts and summarize it automatically. Its a great way to crowdsource new quality content. \n\n\\- Grading of lead quality. The context from leads (especially the written notes) is analyzed and returns a \"hotness rating\" for the lead which prioritizes our outbound calling. This works perfect, before we could only do this prioritization on hard data (page, product, etc) and now also on written text \"I'm in the market to buy xxx and saw this on your website\". Big win.\n\n\\- Saving on legal costs; LLM's write pretty good legal documents. So nowadays we pay mostly just for reviewing and not so much for writing all pieces. It did cut costs down. But my expectation is that legal firms will cut their prices at some point and generate these themselves (but still, costs down).  \n\n\nWhat didn't work out;  \n\\- Client support; the amount of hallucinations are way too much to let the current AI converse with our clients. Too many wrong answers even though everything is correct in the knowledge base. No matter how we structured data, answers were wrong. It worked well as a context to JSON query converter, but it was lacking the actual intelligence part.",

It makes shipping and testing easier, but customer feedback still matters more than intuition.\n\nAnother takeaway is that AI doesn’t remove the need to understand your ideal customer. Generating things faster only works when the output is actually valuable to the right people.\n\nAnd even with all the automation, communities still matter.

It spoke around 80 hours in a month so we saved around 2400-2600$ per month, which is around 30k per year. Considering our margin of 30%ish, to net that amount of profit we would have needed to sell around 90,000$ of burgers, and it is now I consider as a \"free money\" we pocket in a year. \n\nWe felt that a lot of people are just calling to ask basic stuff, and  when our cashier wasnt able to pick up the phone, all of their complaints or questions went directly to Yelp and downgrade our reviews. We did not put a cheese in the burger and we got 1 star review on yelp. That AI we are using it asks the questions to customer and even does discounts on the next visit which goes directly to our system. It gathers basic info for catering and sets up a call with a manager. They actually provided us a mini SaaS dashboard with CRM database of our clients who actually called us several times and with complaint history.\n\nWe were very sceptic but we gave it a shot. Now I am so surprised that there are many restaurants they are not using it thinking the customers will hang up the phone, but that was not true if you choose a right one. There are a lot of crappy ones out there. Choose only who are specialized in your industry. The one we are using came with a lot of automations, so always ask if they are just providing only talking with customers function or anything else. We also \"trained\" our customers to call us and place an order through phone. During rush hour we figured that people who take a car and hit highway won't go to a website and order from there. So they call and place an order not getting distracted while they are driving.  We got monthly around 10-15k of orders placed like that\n\nMy biggest learning was not to be sceptic and always be up to date with the technology. Eventually everyone will get used to AI as we did to PC and Internet.",

A couple “language” points to clarify what I think you’re saying.\n\nJobs are usually many different tasks. AI may automate or expedite some tasks, but the job itself becomes more about higher level thinking, more critical creative work. Honestly probably less rote, mindless work, and more about like, almost supervising the robot and understanding the “why” behind the work it is doing.\n\nLike you mentioned, the calculator didn’t impede our ability to do math; we actually just started working on much harder problems once we stopped wasting our time on manual calculations.

So entrepreneurship seemed like the quickest way to spot something wrong and just go fix it myself.\n\nMy reasons for doing it changed over time. I kind of break it down into a few stages.\n\nFirst theres control like deciding what I work on and how I use my days. Back when I started that felt way more important than making money right away.\n\nThen leverage came into it building something once and watching it grow without starting over all the time every week or so.\n\nAnd meaning too working on stuff that Id still want to do even if nobody else cared or noticed.\n\nThe whole point for me isnt some huge exit or anything dramatic. Its more about having options being able to turn down things and pick projects because I want to not because I have to.\n\nTalking to other people who started businesses Ive noticed something. If the only reason is money or looking good it wears you out in that long boring stretch in the middle. But if its about being curious or having some freedom or scratching a real problem you can keep going longer without resenting it all.\n\nI wonder how others think about this.\n\nLike did your main reason shift after messing up the first time or getting a win.\n\nWhat are you aiming for in the end freedom or making a difference or something else specific.\n\nHonestly what keeps you showing up every day in this entrepreneurship thing.\n\nIt seems like we dont just pick it once most of us have to choose it again every year or so.

      "selftext": "Three months ago, I was talking to a client who runs a small food marketplace in Australia. She told me about one of her vendors - a single mom who started a home-based dumpling business during COVID. She was doing 50 orders a week, but after UberEats took their cut, she was netting less than minimum wage.\nThe worst part? She had no direct relationship with her own customers. Couldn't email them, couldn't offer loyalty discounts, nothing.\nMy team had just finished building a custom platform for another client, and we thought - what if we created a commission-free model specifically for home cooks?\n\nThe technical challenge was massive:\n・Home cooks are NOT tech-savvy. Whatever we built had to be simpler than Instagram.\n・Payment processing had to handle individual vendors under one platform.\n・We needed a way for customers to discover multiple vendors in their area.\n・Android app was non-negotiable (most vendors only had phones, not computers).\n\nWhat we ended up building:\n・A 2-tap order system for customers\n・Vendor dashboard that literally any grandma could use\n・Automated payout system every 24 hours\n・Zero commission on pickup/self-delivered orders\n\nThe result that still gets me: That same dumpling vendor is now doing 80 orders/week, keeping 100% of her profits, and has a direct SMS list of 200+ customers. She sent us a video of her new kitchen setup last week.\nWe learned that custom software isn't about fancy features - it's about removing the middleman that's eating someone's livelihood.\nThe platform now has 200+ vendors and processes 500+ orders weekly. Not huge numbers, but every one of those orders represents more money in a small business owner's pocket.\n\nWhy I'm sharing this: We have capacity for one similar marketplace project this quarter. If you're in an industry where middlemen are eating your margins (or your vendors' margins), I'd be happy to share our architecture and vendor acquisition playbook.\n\nThe tech stack is React/Node/AWS if you're curious, but honestly, the tech is the easy part. The hard part is designing for non-technical users who just want to sell their food without becoming software experts.",

I just wanted restaurants without checking prices and being able to say yes to friends without doing math in my head.\n\nThe real plot twist is when you stop viewing money as something to spend and start seeing it as freedom capital instead. Invest in time, health, and skills that made you money in the first place. The successful people I know all seem to hit the same point: the money doesn't matter as much as having choices.\n\nWhat stage are you in - still figuring out what 'rich spending' even looks like, or past that?\"",

We borrowed money from our siblings and had 150 custom energy drinks with 3 flavors.\n\nIt didn't do too good so we added add on items like collectibles, plushies, kids toys that related to the gamer niche and it sold really good from average $150 from the energy drinks to making 4-5k a month just from collectibles and toys. The last 3 months, we sold 0 energy drinks but all the kids collectibles kept being sold out. Our brand name has the word energy in it and we don't know if we should rebrand OR keep the site and just keep selling collectibles, plushies and kids toys. Should we throw our main brand energy drinks and tailor to collectibles and the kids market instead? We have passion in our energy drinks and we are worried that it might kill our future passion as we wanted to keep being in the gamer and fitness niche. This is our first business together and we are stuck on what to do. ",

When Twitch was founded, it was called JustinTV. They live blogged the dude Justin's everyday life over the website. They found out people were more interested in having a website act as an apparatus for their own live streaming purposes, and so they pivoted to provide that service and turn the business into what we now know as Twitch.\n\nSo, maybe you do need to change the name. If you do, it's probably better to bite the bullet and do that now, before you become to big. But the important moral of the story here is to provide your core customer base with what they want. You already know who your market is. Gamers. And now they're screaming at you exactly what they want. I think you should make the full pivot and focus on the collectibles.",

And I and everyone else thought it was a good idea then as well. You are not going to sell energy drinks meaningfully. Not at Lan parties, not at eSports events, not on your clan or guild website and especially not with your face on it because you are a famous streamer. Unless you have big boobs maybe. But even then it will not justify the effort. Best outcome will be you have free drinks on your next clan lan party and everyone gives 20 bucks to get rid of your inventory. Concentrate on your collectibles. Cheap worthless crap people don't need always sells well and has huge margins. Especially if you have famous promoters. If you don't want to rebrand, just duplicate your existing sales infrastructure with different branding and without energy drinks. You can keep the invoicing company the same and only have it appear on impressum and invoices.",

I wouldn’t kill the energy drink idea, but I also wouldn’t force it.\n\nWhat I’d do is treat collectibles as the main brand for now and park the energy drink as a future product. You can always spin it back later as a limited drop or a separate sub brand once you have money, audience, and leverage. Right now the toys are funding your learning and growth.\n\nRebranding isn’t failure, it’s alignment. Tons of successful companies started as one thing and became another because customers pulled them there. Follow demand first, ego and passion second. You’re young enough to come back to energy drinks later with way more power.\n\nIf you try to revive energy drinks while ignoring what’s selling, you risk killing both.

You don't have product-market fit for the energy drinks. Something is off in who you're selling it to, what you're selling, how you're selling it, or why your target audience would want to buy it. This business needs it's foundations looked at, starting with the ideal customer you want to serve, what is their name, what do they care about, and why they make energy-drink buying decisons.\n\n\n\nBusiness Two is a plushie/collectible biz, which so far, you HAVE got the hang of. You know who you're selling to. They clearly want the product (plushie-collectibles). They know why they're buying it, at least subconsciously, and you can clearly see the demand. This business could be scaled up if you want to earn some solid income, or it can be closed/sold if it's not a business you're interested in being in.\n\n\n\nIf the businesses are meant to work as one, ie: two-sides-of-one-business, similar to red bull's sports-media branch + red bull's energy drink branch, then you'll either need to find a way to make both profitable, or accept one will always be a loss-leader, not meant to generte income, but instead to found a culture/movement. This is ambitious though, and usually something that is done AFTEr you have a successful product, as the culture will build around it. Technically still doable, but like I said, ambitious if you don't already understand biz basics.\n\n\n\nThe \"name\" issue is irrelevant until you understand the businesses, and who the businesses will be serving, because whatever name you choose must resonate with, and appeal to, the target market (as opposed to turning them off.)\n\n\n\nUltimately the seemingly money-obsessed (or at least money-focused) people in the comments likely aren't worth listening to.\n\n\n\nYou don't have to make important life decisions such as what you're gonna do as your career for the next little while based off of \"money.\"\n\n\n\nThe truth is that consumers will flow dollars to you for *all sorts of things,* when marketed and sold to in ways that resonate with them. This means you can absolutely succeed with energy drinks, or you can succeed with plushies. The only difference is, you stumbled on product-market-fit with one of those already, but not the other.\n\n\n\nThis means plushies will feel \"easier\" for now, since you've got past one of the hardest parts of business, but it doesn't mean you can't do similar with energy drinks.\n\n\n\nIn any case, understanding business deeply, and approaching the situation with calm, maturity, and inner-peace while looking objectively at the facts of the matter, will empower you to make a decision that will serve all involved to the highest level possible.",

The market fit you found with your brand and the collectibles is what you want (maybe not what you did expect 😅). \n\nNow the next step is to find is energy drinks drive traffic / are bundled up with the high selling products (to see if they helped your website). Considering you sold 0 in the last periods you have your answer. Maybe this changes. Don’t chase paid, but keep investing time in organic if you believe in the project (have reason to believe ..)\n\nAlso keep in mind that energy drinks are an 18+ product (morally it’s not ok selling to kids), while maybe your audience also includes children. It’s a relevant dynamic. I can’t say more without knowing more.\n\nI don’t know why you think you can’t have “energy” in a toy’s name 🧸 🤣 energy bear would rock 🤘🏻",

For me, the work is building moments where we’re forced to label what we know versus what we’re guessing. It slows things down, but it usually prevents bigger messes later.",

Cleaning, trades, removals, clinics, pet services. Demand is constant. The opportunity is not inventing something new, it is doing marketing, systems, and customer experience better than owners who are stuck in the past.\n\nContent alone barely pays anymore, but it still works as leverage. Newsletters, YouTube, TikTok are not the business. They are the attention layer that feeds into something else like consulting, services, products, communities, or software.\n\nB2B is still strong because businesses pay faster and complain less than consumers. If you help save time or money through automation, operations, compliance, or simple systems, you do not need massive reach to make real income.\n\nNiche info products still work when they are extremely specific. One clear problem, one clear outcome, for one type of person. Distribution matters more than polish.\n\nCrypto is not dead, but the easy phase is over. The money now is around tools, services, audiences, and infrastructure, not blind buying and hoping.\n\nThe real shift is that the internet stopped rewarding copy paste ideas.

It puts the burden of performance in our court, since we've already been paid, and I trust us more than I trust some customers. \n\nThe dependency on them signing an \"acceptance certificate\" is a real problem, and I'd never go into an engagement in which the client can just not sign a paper and leave things in limbo. But that alone isn't enough if the client is operating in bad faith and has more power than you do. \n\nProgress payments, of course, cut down your financial risk and allow the customer to prove that they are operating in good faith. Optimally we ask for 20-40% on signing, another chunk at V1 milestone, and some portion 20-35% on completion, for a small-medium sized project. More milestones for bigger and/or longer engagements. \n\nIt happens in the US. We once had a large legal information company that might rhyme with, uh, plexus, leave us holding the bag for $180K.

The software should render itself inoperable due to outdated signed software components, failure to update, or built-in expirations on software components, as agreed upon on gates in the software review. Really, instrument the software in any reasonable way for it to say, \"I haven't been updated in a while, that's an operational risk due to &lt;expiring certificates, etc.,&gt; so I'm shutting down.\"\n\nNo customer for B2B software is ever to be fully trusted until the final invoice is paid.

I'm only a few years older than you but was around the same age when I was introduced and \"required\" in a sense to take over.\n\nWhat may have worked for him in the past may not work in modern times as you mentioned, your father does not understand social media. You however do so it is left to you to follow up and try something with it as our society mostly revolves around social media now. An idea would be perhaps try to find if there are influencers (doesn't have to be incredibly famous) in your area who review food joints and treat them to a full course meal.\n\nIf the food you are serving is good and there is still business along with frequently returning customers, then that part doesn't need immediate attention. Try the influencer idea first and if traffic picks up then you will have the financial leisure to hire a head chef. This way you could perhaps add new and more modern dishes to the menu for testing. It's all trial and error at the end of the day and I believe that we are more fitted for failure than our parents who most likely started the business from scratch with no back up. However what we do have is the foundation that they have laid out for us and if one dish fails, it's not going to change much if any, just keep trying.\n\nI wish you the best of luck and hopefully provided a bit of help. It's a lot of pressure at once but I'd say both you and I are somewhat lucky to be in such a situation. A lot of people are just slaving away and would pray to be in a situation such as this.\n\nEdit: typos",

They must sit in the booth and be ready to support and or work if needed.\n\nThis is more for them to let go slowly and it’s probably one of the great favors you will ever do them to two things: still feel needed and ease into awareness they are not needed because the place is in the hands they raised. \n\nThis is important for them they put their everything into it and a transitional structure is emotionally needed. Especially at the age they are and the letting go at that age scares elderly of any cut of cloth because everyone this age thinks about losing their edge just when they have earned relaxation. I’m talking about faculties, bruv.\n\nMeanwhile, you are busy not only optimizing everything you can (that hasn’t been done already) and making alterations that show the customers what a great tradition is continuing in the community. This is smart business.\n\nThe real transfer of leadership (despite your managerial skills) will come when the matriarchal ladies of your community make complimentary comments to your parents at their table praising you.\n\nThey get to beam proudly and always will and you learn the community grants you customer side ownership socially. The smaller the town, the more important this is.\n\nA few years later, after the menu and decor and productivity changes you made your thumbprint with are established, one day your parents won’t be sitting at their table you set for them.\n\nHave something set aside and call a travel agent and send them on a cruise for at least a couple weeks.  They will love it and reconnect with a lot of each other they didn’t have time for because of the 17 years of hustle. This will be happiness you gave them.\n\nThey will begin to spend more time at home and not too many years of your life have passed.  You have done right by them and have kept yourself in the game of “I still can go do what I want.”\n\nThis is important for your life.\n\nUr 28, and after all this transitions you will prolly be 33-35.\n\nAll this while, to yourself, you have been keeping and eye on the market around your area and the right time to sell the business will become evident.

The broker is feduciarily obligated to make sure you get a fair price and you’re going to be 35, have investments and savings while you managed and a big check for the sale of the business, happy parents who couldn’t have had the takeover go any sweeter, and still have a lot of youth and years ahead of you.\n\nThere’s only one real hitch, and it’s not a bug it’s a feature- you may want to keep it going and pass it on to your kids.",

My guess is also the restaurant has a lot of deferred maintenance that will cost tens of thousands of dollars/pounds to fix.

Make a crazy complicated milkshake with a piece of pie and ice cream on the top. Sell a giant cookie shaped like a taco with ice cream in it.  \n\nIdeas has nothing to do with your genre... you have a very unique opportunity you will never have in a job:  You have an inside route to control what is or is not on the menu and likely all other related operations.\n\nIf you want to pursue graphic design, you should be doing it for the restaurant.  No reason to go to school or get a job in it, you literally can already start doing it.  \n\nYou're doing dual duty sure, but your goal of doing dual duty is to create menu items and design ads that bring in more customers.

In the current stage it’s a job that pays very little on an hourly basis and you’d be better off taking a role somewhere else. Beyond the sentimental value, you could most likely find a job paying you 100k a year even if not immediately but after a few years and with reasonable working hours. If you can improve the math this could be a good business too and you’d not need to start from zero either. Hospitality is known to be a hard business to make meaningful profit and as far as I know most small restaurants are like your family’s, with the family members putting in a lot of hours and only barely keeping it afloat.

It is a family hobby that is being treated like a business.\n\nBefore you look at profits or future plans, you need clear answers to some very basic questions.\n\nHow much is your father paying himself.\n\nHow much is he paying you.\n\nHow much is he paying your mother.\n\nAnd most importantly, are these amounts paid before or after the stated 100K net profit. Without clarity on this, the number means absolutely nothing.\n\nThe next step is a proper financial analysis of the business. You cannot base decisions on the 100k figure. You need a full overview that includes the value of the building, the full kitchen equipment, the nearby house if that is part of the setup, and the amount of cash or liquid assets the business has. If the restaurant has been operating for 17 years, nets around 100K per year, and you say it used to be more successful, I would expect there to be a minimum of 200K to 1M in cash or equivalents. If that money is not there, you need to understand exactly where it went.\n\nYou should also separate the real estate from the restaurant business in your thinking. Check what similar buildings rent for in your area. If the property could realistically be rented out for 4K to 10K per month, your parents could still generate fifty to one hundred thousand per year in rental income while retired, and you would be free to pursue a different job.\n\nIf you are considering continuing the restaurant, do a market analysis. Look at how many people actually live in the area, how other restaurants nearby are performing, and whether this is a touristic region or are you guys fully dependent on regulars. How old is the surrounding population Are your prices too high, or are they actually too low etc...\n\nNext go through the menu in detail and recalculate your pricing. A simple rule of thumb is that if something costs you 1 dollar it should sell for at least x4 to x5 that amount. You need to calculate gross revenue, food cost, labor cost, overhead, and the actual net profit behind that 100K figure.  \nThen you need to add realistic labor costs for all the roles your father currently fulfills. Then recalculate your menu prices and ask yourself honestly whether customers would still be willing to pay those prices. If the answer is yes, you raise prices gradually. If the answer is no, then the business model itself is the problem.\n\nIf you have a decent POS system, you should be able to see exactly which items sold over the past year. Compare those numbers to your menu. Items that only sell a few times per year should be removed.\n\nAlso don't forget you have some advantages compared to people your age who want to start a restaurant business. You are not paying rent, and you do not need to buy or lease kitchen equipment. Depending on the area, that alone can be a100K per year advantage",

The only people this will appeal to are those looking to buy a job, and who really want to run their own restaurant and put the hours in to make it so. Anyone else should and would run a mile, and you are in that group.\n\nYour parents should either work to get it in a position where the current (or with one or two new hires) could keep it running with sufficient net profit for your dad to make a passive income, maybe with a mind to seller financing it to that team, or get some proper figures worked out and see if it makes an appealing proposition to a budding restauranteur.\n\nAlternatively, push hard for the next few years to maximise profits and then liquidate.

From the beginning, we agreed to pay ourselves a modest monthly amount and reinvest most of the profits back into the business. I trusted him to handle the financial side because he had experience and I didn’t.\n\nI’ve now discovered he’s been using the business account for personal expenses—family vacations, a vehicle for his wife, private school tuition for his kids, and more. He also took out a $40k loan under the business without telling me, and I still don’t know what the money was used for. The business account is drained, and we’re now in debt under both of our names. He is not sorry for what he's done.\n\nTo make things worse, we never signed any formal partnership agreement, but we did create an LLC. I was inexperienced and didn’t realize how risky that was.\n\nI want to leave and start my own business, but I’ve spent five years helping build the reputation, customer base, and goodwill of this one. I’d like him to keep the current business, but I feel like I should be compensated for the value I helped create.\n\nHow can I determine what a fair buyout amount would be? Has anyone been in a similar situation?",

          "body": "This is practical advice only based on my experience. \n\nI've been party to an unfriendly two-person LLC breakup, with me and a silent partner. As the operating member I made financial decisions, including for my own compensation, with which my silent partner later took issue. He sued and I lawyered up, just like you will do.\n\nHis suit focused on my comp. My goal all along had been to buy him out of the company, but he was completely non-responsive to any communication. So having him sue me was a good thing in that sense--it started the process. That's a strategy--your partner will have to pay attention.\n\nBut--as soon as he sued, I had legal representation from a top-5 law firm. I think receiving my response to his suit from a very serious firm settled him down a bit and let him know that we would not be bullied or put off. That was key, in my opinion. \n\nOur response proposed that we submit the matter to mediation. But we required him to drop the suit, reasoning that we could talk or we could fight but not both. We mediated and came to a price that was about what I had thought to offer him before he sued. I even got him to finance it.\n\nI'm sharing this because I believe it would be wise to figure out what you want to have happen, but also how you would like it to happen. Think down the road past the dispute and keep it about numbers, whether you want to retain the business or walk away. There may be other considerations. For example, I'd suggest talking to your bank about an SBA loan to potentially finance the company on the other side of the transaction. Your partner may not have a lot of cash if he's taking from the company. If you take him out of the existing company and finance it over time (not optimal, given distrust), you may need some cash for operations. Or, on the other hand, he may need financing to buy you out (though that might be tough if the books are a mess). \n\nAbout mediation--I think my legal costs were about $25K (though I got a bit of deal through connections), much less than they would have been had we pursued the matter via lawsuit, and really just noise in terms of the total buyout cost.  \n\nGood luck.",

Payment upfront: they've lost the privilige of credit with you. \n\nBased on their response, it sounds like their business is on its way down. It feels like they'll shut down tbh if they can't manage their finances well enough to avoid this. I bet you're not the only business they're stiffing right now.\n\nTalk to whoever is in charge and be kind, but firm. You're considering legal action but you don't want to torpedo this relationship. You know that they are having difficulties paying, but it's screwing you over after you've already provided services/products to them. Try to negotiate some solution: maybe they pay the biggest invoices first, maybe they pay the oldest first, maybe it's a simple payment plan where they pay $1000 a month. At the very least, if they shut down in 6 months, you'll have received *some* money back.\n\nDuring the Great Recession, the company I worked for really struggled to pay bills. I wasn't there, but my dad is the owner and there were many months where he did not get a paycheck so all the employees and utilities could get paid. The company had to negotiate many payment plans to not lose their vendor relationships. They felt awful not being able to pay, but they knew that not paying anything was screwing over the other businesses - after all, some of their own woes were from people not paying *them!* Some of the payment plans were really longterm (with the vendors with the best relationships we could lean on. some of the payment plan documents I saw lasted years.), some of them were much stricter and shorter. The company made everyone whole, but those companies who were willing to negotiate solutions were very appreciated versus those who went immediately to legal action with no other communication.",

If you go the collection agency you'll pay a substantial amount of whatever they recover, if they recover anything, and that's it.  If you go the lawyer route you'll pay a fortune for their services and if they recover anything they'll take a cut of that also.  Small claims court islike $50-100 to file a claim. It'll involve a few mornings or afternoons of your time for an hour or so each time, but if you were hired for work or they ordered goods and did not pay, they are dead In the water and have no argument against you.  The court will issue a judgment against them, which is the ugly stain on a credit report, and then you can file for either a lien application to their personal property, or you can file for a wage garnishment if they work.  Either way, there's a roadmap to getting money out of them hopefully, and quite often a court officer will convince them to pay up to avoid the credit woes or to negotiate a settlement.

So that's sort of the first hurdle. \n\nFrom there, there are some sort of entrenched process built around figuring out what the measurable KPIs are and seeing what you can do to optimize those. \n\nSo essentially the camera would have potential as a visual measurement tool of sorts. If you could find a way to build that out and pitch it you might be on to something. Just gotta think of what would be the valuable KPIs that you would enable measuring. \n\nGood luck!",

The software puts it in the right 'pile'. Your accountant gets an easy ride, you get an overview.  And if you switch accountants, you STILL  have that overview. \n\nHere in the Lowlands of Belgium and the Netherlands, we have Silvasoft ( for bigger businesses,  also has a lot of add ons for different needs,  but subscription for just the add ons you need), and Dexxter for smaller businesses.  There's loads of others, but that's the ones I have experience with. \n\nSee if there's something similar, where you are.if there's not... perhaps a pioneer can make it happen 👀\n\nThe new system is dividing accountancy into 'small businesses that do the prepwork with software', and 'bigger businesses that have their own accountant' over here. \nThe plus side of the software  is that the overview you get from your excel sheet is in your account. You just click on what you want an overview of, and tahdah",

Set up location-specific folders for assets and drafts, so you’re not digging around every time you post.\n3. Schedule posts in batches and plan a month ahead where possible.

For DMs and comments, having a unified inbox is a lifesaver. It cuts down on missed messages and lets you track location-specific queries.\n\nI use NovaSpark for this kind of work since it lets me manage unlimited accounts from one dashboard, schedule ahead, and see analytics by location, which is helpful for reporting. Plenty of other platforms like Sprout Social or Buffer can help too, but you'll want to look for something that doesn’t limit the number of accounts and lets you easily switch contexts between locations.",

      "selftext": "I need help. I’m 15 years in and still get killed by the same thing every time a holiday or a break rolls around. I own several locations of a food business that I began 15 years ago. I employ a large number of college age people and a healthy number of 20somethings, then a group of people in their 30s and early 40s that have worked here since I started the business.\n\nThe problem we run into many times a year is we can’t grant everyone their day off requests. We can get staff really trimmed down, but we still need people to work. We have shortened hours on holidays, which are our busiest days of the year, but when we have to deny a day off request, they end up calling in sick anyway. It happened Christmas Eve, it happened again this morning.\n\nIf you have a similar business, retail or food service that needs to be open holidays (not the actual holiday but the day before), how do you handle it when literally everyone asks for the same day off? And then calls in anyway??\n\nObviously I’m frustrated this morning because I have several locations that are completely screwed and have customers picking up orders etc. etc. And I can’t be in all places at the same time.\n\nOutside of a holiday, how do you handle people calling off a shift and no one else picking it up? Do you have a sick day policy like they have have to produce a doctors note after so many days?\n\nThanks so much, any advice is welcome!\n\nEditing to add: thank you for the feedback! I appreciate it so much. We do time and a half for the holiday and day before, and at the end of the year they get a bonus for every holiday worked. For most of them, time and a half is around $25, for some it’s closer to $40. The problem is most of them don’t need the job. They’ll quit if they don’t get the days off or if we require a doctors note. They’ll argue they don’t have insurance and don’t need a job and they peace out. It wasn’t this bad a few years ago but this year and last it’s been constant.",

          "body": "I feel this one. Hard. You are not doing anything wrong. This is one of the most frustrating realities of running a food business right now especially with a workforce that does not actually need the job.\n\nFirst off you are already doing more than most. Time and a half holiday premiums end of year bonuses. That is solid. At some point though money stops being the lever. If someone is willing to quit over working Christmas Eve no incentive was going to change that.\n\nOne thing that has helped me and others I know is intentional over hiring around holidays. You know these days are coming and you know call offs will happen. Bring in seasonal or short term people who actually want the hours. They are usually grateful not jaded and far more likely to show up. Even better if you can cross train across locations so you are not stuck when one store gets hit.\n\nIf you can swing it build a small on call bench. Pay them a small flat rate to be available and if they get called in they get the full shift pay plus the premium. It is cheaper than losing sales and sanity.\n\nThe other big piece is clear firm policies and sticking to them every single time. Holiday time off has to be first come first served. Once the schedule is posted that is it. If someone gets denied and then magically gets sick that gets documented. No drama no arguing just tracked.\n\nInstead of doctors notes which usually blow up in your face go with progressive consequences. A couple unexcused call offs fine. Keep doing it and you lose priority for holidays preferred shifts or hours. If it becomes a pattern you move on. Not as punishment just because reliability actually matters in this business.\n\nAnd honestly this is the hardest but most freeing mindset shift. Not everyone is a fit for a job that requires holidays. That is okay. But it is not optional. If someone would rather quit than work one or two key days a year they are telling you who they are. Let them.\n\nOne unreliable person can wreck an entire location burn out your good people and put you in firefighting mode all day. At some point protecting the business and the team that does show up has to come first.\n\nYou are doing your best in a tough environment. Tightening the structure is not being heartless it is how you keep the whole thing from breaking.",

Basically each quarter or month (depends on how the business works), we set aside a fixed percentage of gross profits that goes into the employee bonus pool.  All else being equal, that pool gets evenly divided across everyone who works there so long as they've worked for the whole period (you can't get hired 3 days before bonus day and get paid out).  But, anyone who has an unexcused absence during the period simply becomes ineligible for the bonus pool.  That means everyone else gets a little more and it becomes a legitimate incentive as the period goes on, more people miss a day, etc.  The only real downside in practical terms is that if someone has an attendance hit 2 days into the period, it's kind of a write-off for them to miss more days.

          "body": "So there are some things you have to take into account here.  Holidays should be business closed days so everyone can spend time with their family and actually have the holiday.\n\nBeing open is a choice that comes with consequences which will always be people wanting to actually take the day off and may take the day off no matter what management says.\n\nFor Christmas I drove around to see who was open and who was closed and respecting their employees over trying to make a squeeze of profits.  Same goes with professionals in the NFL, nobody wants to work on Christmas, they want to be at home with their family and doing this year over year on Holidays really messed up their family they are trying to build and maintain.\n\nAs a business you have to think about the people that work for you and how working on a day the whole country gets off and how it makes them feel to just be there working for 1/100th of their value.\n\nNow I understand it might be a busy day, and you choose to be open because you make a ton of money but you have to pay the price for being open on a national holiday which means staff crunch.  Now if you want to show some care and love and have to be open because it is good for cashflow do so but also make sure you are paying by default holiday pay.\n\nWhy holiday pay you ask, because extra pay is how businesses actually say thank you when asking people to do things they normally wouldn't do like work on the holidays.  If this means paying them 3x or 4x their hourly rate to include overttime that will more than likely drastically reduce your problem with people calling out or taking off during this time.  You might even have the problem of too many people requesting to work during this time.\n\nMoney talks, you want to send a message to the employees that them being their is wonderful for the business let your checkbook do the talking.  I would actually recommend setting a new policy that starting January 1, 2026 Xx holiday pay will be standard going forward. Whatever that multiplier is you set it and maybe even make it variable starting at 2x and going up depending on how bad you need people there.  Send that out and make sure you send out a reminder before holidays come up weeks in advance to get bookings and make sure you have enough people on staff in case a couple of people are legitimately sick and need to stay home.\n\nJust like in big business if you want someone to work on Thanksgiving, 4th of July, Christmas, etc. it better be an emergency.  Treating these as normal work days shows zero empathy and doesn't set things well if you are also looking for people to stay long term.  Let the money speak and you'll see some serious change in your staffing situations.",

If you opt in, you’re committing. If you opt out, you’re not scheduled at all and that’s known upfront.\n• Calling in sick on a denied request off day = treated differently than a random sick day. Not punishment, just fewer preferred shifts going forward.\n• Managers stop scrambling to save every shift. If a location has to shorten hours or close early once or twice, staff quickly realize the policy isn’t bluffing.\n\nThe hard truth is: if most of your staff doesn’t need the job, incentives stop working. At that point it becomes about building a smaller core of reliable people and designing around expected absenteeism instead of reacting to it.\n\nIt sucks, but I don’t think this is you doing something wrong — it’s a labor reality shift the last couple years.",

Not sure why that is so clear to me and not others, they are people. If they are declining or \"opting out\" whatever you are offering is not enough. Make it voluntary, let them know upfront how much the bonus will be plus double time, signup for the voluntary work a month ahead of time, if no one signups add more bonus until it doesn't make sense anymore for you, and then close those days, or pay triple time and a bonus and take a loss to keep the customers happy for repeat business.

Anyone who is scheduled for a holiday and calls off gets the lowest priority for their next request.\n\nAnd you need to have some negative consequences for people who call off during holidays. You could give them a week or two with fewer hours or even no hours. You can give them the less desirable shifts. You can have them lose bonuses or holiday pay. Plenty of ways to do it without actually having to fire anyone, although that shouldn't be totally off the table.\n\nSad to say, but sometimes as a boss you have to be a bit of dick to get things done.",

We've been using a payroll software that my original accountant recommended, but I swear every pay period something there is slightly wrong and I have no idea why.\n\n  \nLast time, someone's state tax withholding was calculated wrong and I spent the longest time on hold with support trying to fix it, since they didn’t give us a designated AM. Then this week I tried to adding a new hire to the system, our benefits and payroll system, but made a mistake entering the info so the info is now wrong in both systems and I need to go manually fix both, just getting to be a pain.  \n\n  \nIs there a payroll software out there that’s worth it? Ideally one that can run payroll fast, is compliant, runs calculations on it’s own, and has good support. I don't have time to become a payroll expert I just need something that works. Appreciate any input here.\n\n  \n",

For others, it’s a lack of capital, time, confidence, or not knowing where to begin.\n\nSo I’m curious:\n\n* What’s the *main* thing holding you back right now?\n* Was there something specific that made you delay?\n\nI’m hoping this discussion helps people (including me) understand the real challenges and maybe even find ways to overcome them.",

You don't know the odds against you for different games. You've never gained experience practicing the game, how to wager, or anything else. You Just Do It.\n\nIn this thought experiment you would rightly feel hesitation as you reach the moment of truth.\n\nBig difference being nobody in a gambling forum would explain away your hesitation. Professional gamblers could conceivably feel irked you haven't thought anything through. That is not what you face in this kind of forum, where people see rational hesitation at doing something monumentally stupid as the real problem. I suggest the heretical notion rational decision making is shunned and reckless abandon touted.\n\nTherefore I don't see what's so difficult to understand. Businesspeople wouldn't try to shut their brain off, nor would they seek out the adrenaline rush of undue risk, they engage in risk-reduction. Wantrepreneurs instead amp themselves up to recklessness and put themselves on the wrong side of the percentages.\n\nHad you read posts here, you would notice many details. People ask what is possible here, not what the probability is. Even moderately skilled gamblers make themselves aware of the odds. As they would read books on gambling. Most have what they will call a 'system' for wagering worked out, a strategy.\n\nHere, I had to write a big long post to explain the relationships between words like \"strategy\" and \"tactic\" and \"objective\" and \"technology.\" Because people were posting to ask about digital strategy and commenters would post the name of this weeks magic platform. Not why, how to use it, what to do. Just the name. And nobody even blinked.\n\nI wouldn't just hesitate. I would fold up my money, put it back in my pocket, then walk away from such a lunatic fringe. The last thing I would consider is popular advice to crap something out, market-blind and trust to the luck I just slapped in the face. These guys make a gambling addiction look like sanity.\n\nThe business answer to hesitation is study, risk-reduction, due diligence, and well-ordered thought. The quippy retorts actually posted to counter this are lunacy and almost qualify as hysterical over-reaction. I'm not advocating for delay nor do I endorse anything different from what an eighth-grade student does when writing a moderately important book report. A few days is typical for such a task and makes zero difference.\n\nPeople here behave as if books cause cancer and research is a four-letter word. Which indicates where all the bad business math comes from. Just Do It dogma causes an attitude of all gas, no brakes ...which leads them to crash their venture into a ditch. Only to post here like a distraught child with a broken toy they've come to an adult to fix. \n\nIf you're so curious, you could have scrolled through posted issues and posted an analysis. This would have been a contribution to the forum, rather than the common strip-mining operation everybody tries.",

          "body": "I have been running my own freelance business for about 5 years now and I think the simplest way to describe it is that I am basically a business partner for hire. People come to me with an idea or an existing business and I set up the administrative side, collab on the entreprenuerial side, and help them develop the \"technician\" side (the product/service in which they are the expert and I don't desire to be a part of - plumbing, building cabinets, or cleaning offices for example). \n\nHere are the main hangups I often see (in no order):\n\n* lack of understanding of what drives business success - Lets say a person wants to start or runs a new locksmithing business. You see a lot of someone thinking something like \"I need to be on TikTok but I don't know how\" to get a business started rather than \"I should go talk to the property manager of this nearby office building and ask who they use for rekeys and lockouts\" (I actually dont know anything about locksmiths but hopefully that makes sense)\n* Incorrect understanding of priorities - similar to above, but I see people focus on something like Social Media before they have their offer and audience figured out and really understand what they are trying to say and who they are trying to say it to. \n* getting overwhelmed by the different \"lanes\" - It's a lot at first to think about not just your service and customers, but also payment processing, invoicing, licenses/insurance, a website, social media, brand, bookkeeping, lead generation, SOPs, and everything else. It can be difficult to carry so many different moving parts, and shuts a lot of people down.\n* All or nothing thinking - This one is similar to the \"lanes\" but its really about overthinking and perfectionism. Believing you need to be 100% dialed in or you aren't ready. It's a good way to keep yourself working towards continuous improvement if you harness the energy, but it kills most people's ideas because you will never have a project fully dialed in before you take a step.\n* Lack of due diligence - People tend to make TONS of assumptions about demand, competition, audience, costs, and other things that they should really take the time to go gather data on - and it has NEVER been easier to get decent data on just about anything than it is now. Acting on bad assumptions has been a huge cause of wasted energy and effort with a lot of business owners I know and work with.\n* fear of networking - this one is simple. Lots of folks are just afraid to talk to people, and even more of them are affraid to talk about their business and why it is awesome.\n* a desire to do it all yourself - This is usually from a cost perspective. I build a lot of websites for clients, often as a one-off service based on referrals. I'd say at least half of the clients I work with have a website that they feel ashamed of that they attempted to build themselves and want me to help them. It is almost always that they didn't want to spend the kind of money that a lot of agencies wanted to charge them (which is also understandable because that is usually nuts also). So, they try to do it themselves. What they don't see is that the amount of time spent on it if looked at from a $/hr perspective isn't usually far off from what they would have paid someone else to do it, and they would have ended up with a decent site rather than a site that they feel does not represent the quality of their business (even if it was overpriced). Nobody would ever try this with something like taxes, but it is WAY too common with stuff like logos, social media, and websites especially. The kicker is that a plumber could be out doing paying jobs INSTEAD of spending that time building a website, which they have zero ability to do.\n\nI have worked with a ton of different types of businesses across different industries, and most of my friends run businesses of some kind, and those are the biggest ones that I see. I think this is why mentorship helps so much - you have someone who can help you see reality. \n\nIn my opinion, entrepreneurship and running a business are huge practices in checking your own thoughts and assumptions, seeing things clearly and without your own filters, and being able to look at things from different perspectives - being objective and getting out of your own way.",

I currently make good money working at a W-2 software company and people in tech complain about 9-9-6, but in the small business world it is more like 6-11-7. I understand the tax savings and potential lifestyle if the small business runs itself once it becomes successful. However, the extreme mental and financial stress is something I have witnessed and I am fortunate enough not needing to do that since our family will make $700k in W-2 in a few years after my spouse finishes up residency. Only thing that is fun and low stress for us is real estate leasing since it is mostly hands off compared to running a small business but it has a capped upside but also a quite large capital investment.\n\nSo to answer your question, W-2 is comfortable and relatively stress free compared to starting a real small business from the ground up.",

And that I'm scared of failing at 'business social media'. That I am afraid of lenders saying no and that's it, no more chances. Or worse, they say yes and I fuck the whole thing up.\n\nI've got fears to face and plenty of work to do but I already feel better just writing it down and acknowledging it. \n\nNext steps is seeking more frequent, smaller feedback from my mentor and writing things down. Stop thinking of every little 'what if' at once and get it on paper as smaller tasks. And, get offline, go find a business group to awkwardly have coffee with :)",

ICHRA can be a great exit ramp from the small-group hamster wheel, but it’s not magic.\n\nPros:  \n- Cost control – You set a defined budget. No surprise 12–20% renewals driven by things your team didn’t even use.  \n- Decouples risk – One employee’s cancer, NICU baby, or specialty drug doesn’t blow up everyone else’s rates. If community rated today, not relevant, may be worth taking a quick glance at something like UHC AllSavers or Aetna AFA for a medically underwritten proposal instead of community rated  \n- Employee choice – People can pick plans that actually fit them (single vs family, HDHP vs richer plans, different networks/carriers).  \n- Portability – Coverage isn’t tied to staying at your company forever, which employees increasingly value.  \n- Scales – Works the same at 12 lives as it does at 120.  \n\nCons:  \n- Execution matters – ICHRA done “DIY” often fails, EE self-service is a struggle  \n- Employees need real help shopping and understanding tradeoffs.  \n- Change management – Some employees like group plans simply because they’re familiar, no national PPO access with most ICHRA markets  \n- Essential Health Benefits vary by state (mainly relevant if in multiple states)  \n- Market variability – Individual market quality varies by state and carrier density.  \n- Perception risk – If framed poorly, employees think “company is dumping insurance,” even when the math is better for them and the company.  \n\nICHRA isn’t a plan replacement as much as a funding strategy.\n\nThe experience your employees have depends almost entirely on:  \n- how much guidance they get,  \n- how transparent you are on dollars,  \n- and whether you treat it as a benefit redesign vs a cost cut.\n\nIf works well for:  \n- Employers who want predictability more than carrier logos  \n- Owners willing to over-communicate during the transition\nUsing a platform + advisor combo instead of “here’s a link, good luck”  \n\nIf your group plan keeps getting worse and more expensive, you’re not crazy, that’s the system behaving exactly as designed. ICHRA just lets you opt out of that design.\n\nHappy to answer more specific questions if helpful.\n\nThink of it as the 401k of healthcare, that's how I like to explain it anyways. It's not a pension (group health plan), it's very similar to the democratization that 401ks provided.\n\nYou'd certainly be an early adopter still at this stage, but it's the fastest growing segment of the \"group insurance\" market today.",

Regulations: particularly important is square footage per student and teacher to student counts as they relate to classroom size. You also want to look at bathroom rules.  For instance our classes are set up where we have the exact square footage for a teacher and an aide to operate with the legal student numbers. We have in classroom bathrooms that allows the aide to handle that while the teacher continues.  We have a floating teacher that does enrichment that lets the mainline teachers take a lunch break. In other words you want to maximize labor to student counts while maintaining a good product. This stuff is so decisive we had an offer for free use of a building that we declined because the room sizes and bathroom locations made it a nightmare on labor to effectively staff it\n\n2. Security: Prior to Uvalde we had a dozen police officers who we gave tuition discounts to in exchange for working pick up and drop off. Since Uvalde we have an armed officer on campus at any time students are there.  Parents want to feel their kids are safe. Off duty cops make $45-$55 an hour in our area. If it doesn't have a camera system better set aside the money to put one in. \n\n3. Competition: Does the school district offer free pre k and kinder? If so you better deliver a high quality preschool rather than a day care or you are limited to very young kids who are more labor intensive.  Also be aware that many churches use preschool and daycare to both draw in new members and absorb building overhead costs but don't expect them to pay off the mortgage on a building or generate a profit. In both cases you may have legacy competition with essentially free real estate\n\n4. What sort of state funding is available for tuition and how bureaucratic is that system? If you go that route you may have a significant staff chasing reimbursement payments.\n\n5. Who is your customer and are you convenient? We specialize as the high end pre school. We are around the corner from the high end elementary magnet elementary school so multi kid parents aren't trying to drive across town.  As a result we have a very geographically diverse student body. Other schools mostly grab from either the residential neighborhoods near them or in the case of the downtown ones the employers near them.\n\n6. What's the vaccine policy? Highly polarizing issue that will cause parents to not consider you or leave when you choose one or the other.\n\nBig piece of due diligence I'd ask for is their file from the state regulators.",

We’ve employed many of the same people for decades. This is not a fly-by-night operation. It’s a family business built over generations, and our employees are the reason it exists.\n\nOver the last couple of years, we’ve been crushed by what feels like a growing abuse of the system. Fraudulent workers’ comp claims, now increasingly framed as “mental stress,” have driven our insurance costs to an unsustainable level. The financial impact has been devastating, not because we did something wrong, but because defending ourselves, even against claims with no merit, is incredibly expensive.\n\nWhat has made this even more alarming is seeing claims and PAGA filings arrive in bulk, with little apparent due diligence. We’ve now been hit with multiple PAGA cases, including one against a company that has never even had an employee. Despite that, we still have to pay attorneys just to prove the obvious.\n\nThe money being spent on legal defense is money that should be going to employee raises, better benefits, and keeping a long-standing business healthy. Instead, it’s being siphoned into attorney fees and skyrocketing insurance premiums.\n\nI’m sharing this because I’m genuinely wondering if other California employers, especially in agriculture or other labor-intensive industries, are experiencing the same thing. Has anyone else been targeted by Abramson Labor Group, or seen a sudden wave of workers’ comp and PAGA filings?\n\nThis isn’t about opposing worker protections. Those matter. This is about a system that has lost balance and is pushing responsible employers to the brink.\n\nIf you’re dealing with something similar, you’re not alone. And if you’re wondering why so many family-run businesses are struggling or leaving the state, this is a big part of the reason why.\n",

If you love driving, you could go for being an uber/cab driver. Entrepreneurship has so many forms you could literally do anything.\n\nI've already read a lot of good things in here so I'd take notes. But by far the most important one - and it is mentioned - get a 9-5 first, get the cashflow back in, start saving and use that as your funding mechanism for the entrepreneurial road.\n\nI've read print-on-demand as an option. I'd steer away from apparel because the manufacturing is just plain sh\\*t. If you want to be in apparel do know that this is a tough business to be in but not impossible. If you could generate a 40% profit margin before tax and all cost deducted, you'd be in fantastic shape.\n\nYou could become a reseller for a brand that is unknow in you area and sell their goods. You could pursue a brand that stand for sustainability and dislike fast fashion etc. Which will give you higher profit margins.\n\nOr maybe there is a restaurant in your area that doesn't have take away yet. Go ask them if they would think about and you drive for them and take a cut.\n\nThe last thing I want to give away is - as a passive investor - just copy the best. Don't try to innovate. If you can undercut something by doing the same but being better in PR, marketing or price. Go ahead and take market share away of them. I say copy don't plagiarize, because that's a felony.\n\nGood luck!",

Wrong business type - If freelancer, don't say company\n2. Old documents - Proof of address must be under 3 months\n3. Vague business description - Consultant too vague. Marketing consultant for SaaS companies, better.\n4.

          "body": "This post reads like you have a big chip on your shoulder\n\nEdit: I'm also in a service-based industry. Here's my pov...\n\n\n1) Define your price structure and your margins. There could be instances where you can fit something in, or you're slow and it will be better profitable with smaller margins but it could lead to more work or you want to help out. Don't work for free but don't say \"no\" right away\n\n2) always look for how to be more efficient (I agree with OP on this one)\n\n3) Track your costs closely and invest in good equipment. Something failing could cost you more than if you had maintained it. An investment in good gear could optimize your team to perform 20% faster. Remember to bake these costs into your overhead - it not just labor costs\n\n4) Remember that you create the atmosphere of professionalism. You don't need a full blown HR department but you need to have rules and guidelines for your team and how they talk to clients. Also, procedures for what happens when employees break these rules so everyone is clear\n\n5) I work in commercial film production. It's a highly competitive industry and extremely fast-moving. How you work with your clients (your partners) will pay dividends over time. Your name is tied to your reputation and it's a small community. At some point, if you've done enough good work with enough good folks, you'll have a strong network who supports you. \n\nBut don't think that you don't need to put in the work to maintain it. \n\nI've seen it go the other too, so keep things professional and limit the burned bridges. \n\nGood luck OP",

If there's a tiny bit of snowfall and a customer wants it removed and is willing to pay for it, why wouldn't you take the job? Or is the problem that you are selling in a way where they don't pay for every time you come out or for how much snow you remove?",
