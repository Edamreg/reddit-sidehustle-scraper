      "selftext": "So I started a lawn care business a little over a month ago (proof on my post history) and ended up scoring 25 clients in one month from leaving door hangers \n\nI worked on a realtors lawn and she was complaining to me about how people park in her 5 acre lot without permission during a very popular event in my city during October. And she offered me $50 to drive there, dig a hole and leave a sign that said ‚Äúprivate property, no trespassing, property is under surveillance 24/7‚Äù so I can tell she REALLY didn‚Äôt want people on her property. \n\nSo instead of accepting the job I offered her to manage the parking lot and charge people for parking and we can split the money. We agreed on 50/50.\n\nFast forward a few days ago , I paid for a few signs and printed pages saying ‚Äúparking $10‚Äù which only costed me a few bucks. \n\nWent there at 1pm and started charging people $10 each for parking. I made $5 for every car that passed \n\nAfter 4 hours charging people non stop I made a total of $4,700 in just parking fees, minus $100 in set up costs. $4,600 profit split between the property owner and took myself $2,300 home today. I am going to do this for 3 more Saturday‚Äôs to pull in some serious dough.\n\nGonna use my profit to buy a nice truck cash for my lawn care business. \n\nOpportunities are out there, is there a chance that you‚Äôre going to do the exact same thing I did and replicate my success? Most likely not but what does help is having the mind of a hustler and noticing dollar bills when people are in pain. ",

I charge $8 per tape and $15 for photo album scanning (up to 100 photos). its not crazy money but im averaging like $400-500 a month now just doing this on weekends\n\npeople are SO grateful because most of them think their memories are just gonna deteriorate. had this one lady cry when she saw her wedding video from 1987 on a USB drive. that was pretty cool ngl\n\nive also started offering to organize the digital files into folders by year/event which adds another $20 and most people want that. thinking about expanding to old film reels too and the equipment is pricey but I got some money aside from St–∞ke and I wanna expand this operation.",

Most people are already stretched thin, and it's likely not the time to waste a bunch of resources on a risky venture as a total newbie.\n\nFor those who have never been able to scale a side gig to a profitable business, baby steps and even pauses may be needed to find a sustainable rhythm to put in the hours.

You pay an hourly fee and rent a grandma to go with you and skip lines at the bank or supermarket or whatever.. snacks are included\n\n \n- Google lens kind of app specialized in translating doctors handwriting\n \n\n- stray cat‚Äôs and dogs printing system. You would print ads in their fur so they go around town showing it off. The money would helo paying for sterilization and other vet bills for them. \n\n \n- lazy food brand - food for people too lazy to prepare it. Cookies already pre-socked in milk; nachos pre-covered in guacamole, pre-sliced oranges, etc\n\n \n- make religious ‚Äúp0rn‚Äù movies - an electrician that enters a client‚Äôs house barefoot with a power drill in hand to fix a tv, while the client is a pretty woman in only a bath robe (like most movies of the kind), but the plot twist is that he really just fixes the tv, they pray together a few minutes and part their ways, no funny business.\n\n \n- tinder app for elderly people. Instead of the current tinder like/dislike mechanic, in works like uber and just connects them to the nearest available option.\n\n \n- poop gamification. A smart toilet where you login each time and compete with friends to see who poops the most in a week, or the heaviest. In my head and with the right skills, you could maybe even play poop battleship with friends\n\n \n- brown emergency lights (like the blue ones police attached to cars roofs in the movies) for when you need to get home fast to poop\n\n \n\nPs: I usually get my ideas at night when I suffer from insomnia, so some might be a bit delusional.. imagine the fun I had reading them in the morning though :)\n \n\nPS2: if any of you can get any of these ideas working, update me, I‚Äôd love to see it ahah",

That tiny shift literally saved me from launching a dozen flops.\n\nThen came CheckEtsy basically, it tells you which keywords actually convert. Not ‚Äútrending,‚Äù not ‚Äúhyped,‚Äù but selling. That‚Äôs how one of my listings accidentally became my top earner. Not because I was smart, I just followed the data for once.\n\nIdeogram and Midjourney completely blew my mind, too. Instead of literally slaving away for hours designing from scratch, I could just pump out a bunch of concepts in minutes, pick the decent ones, and quickly clean them up. It wasn‚Äôt even about 'AI magic,' really, it was just about pure speed - getting to the next idea way faster.\n\nAnd this one still kinda trips me out: some random little Google indexing tool I stumbled upon online. It basically made my pages show up on search way, way faster. Nothing fancy, at all, but it was like a secret shield, making sure all the stuff I'd already bothered building didn't just vanish into the internet abyss.\n\nNone of these tools made me rich, obviously. But man, together they just shaved off all the soul-crushing, boring parts and let me actually focus on the fun stuff. They basically kept my side hustle chugging along while I was busy pretending to take breaks.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the one tool that ended up helping you more than you expected?\n\n",

      "selftext": "I‚Äôve been digging into what it really takes to turn a blog into a money maker in 2025, and one thing keeps coming up is consistency. If you publish only once in a while, you‚Äôll never build enough momentum for search engines or readers to trust you. It is the bloggers who post weekly or more tend that scale much faster when it comes to traffic. Over time, that regular output compounds into more keywords, internal links, and authority, which are all essential for real income growth.\n\nMonetization usually starts with ads and affiliate links. A good benchmark is RPM, which means revenue per 1,000 pageviews. Currently, I have monetized my blog with Google Ad sense and the RPM usually hovers around $10-15. \n\nLooking at more successful blogs, many now report around $20 to $30 RPM on average across combined ad and affiliate income. For example, 20,000 monthly pageviews at a $25 RPM equals about $500 per month. \n\nOnce you meet traffic thresholds, you can also apply for premium ad networks, which often pays $12 to $30 or more per thousand views. AdSense and similar networks pay differently by region, with traffic from the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. earning much higher rates. As your blog grows, you can add digital products, sponsored posts, or courses. Blogs with multiple income streams can reach $50 to $100 RPM or higher.\n\nThe potential is real. But you need consistent posting, good SEO, and the patience to build authority. If you‚Äôre starting or trying to grow a blog this year, focus on steady publishing, optimizing for high-value countries, and gradually improving your monetization setup.\n\nIf you have any questions about monetization and the likes, let me know.

If you have a good eye and instinct you can go to swap meets, yard sales, thrift stores etc and find stuff to post on eBay and make double on each one. That's an easy place to start cause all you really need is a smart phone. 5k could go a long way from there. You could buy a car and start doing Uber, doordash and/grubhub also and make that money back in a month or less etc...I wouldn't dream up a hard to do idea and take months trying to recoup my initial investment.

So a few days later, I did my own research (im careful, but i think that's for the best) and more and more i realized how the whole thing worked. Because you hedge any bets you place, you are always making sure you have all of the outcomes covered so technically you can't lose and I know it sounds too good to be true but really it's just math. And then you use sportsbook promos to extract actual money. It's not a get rich quick thing but that's not what i was looking for, just wanted a small hustle i can pick up whenever i have time and not worry about it.",

With the whole AI boom happening, it feels like no one‚Äôs giving fresh grads a chance. I‚Äôve applied to a ton of jobs, but either I don‚Äôt hear back at all, or I‚Äôm just not shortlisted. I‚Äôve also tried some data annotation gigs and other side jobs, but honestly, the pay is so low, and the work doesn‚Äôt seem worth it. I‚Äôm tired of grinding through apps and microtasks that barely pay anything, and I just need something that feels like it respects the effort I‚Äôm putting in.\n\nI‚Äôm looking for a remote side hustle that pays decently and allows me to put in the work without getting burned out. I‚Äôm open to learning new things and willing to put in the time, but I just need something that values my time and effort and actually provides a reasonable return. I‚Äôm not looking for something that requires years of experience, but I do want something where I can develop skills and get paid fairly. If anyone has any legit side hustles, remote gigs, or freelance work that they think might be a good fit, I‚Äôd really appreciate any suggestions!\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

Find products your audience already talks about or asks for and drop Amazon Associates or ShareASale links. If your pages are niche-specific even better - reach out to brands directly for commission deals.\n\nDigital products take time to create but if you know your audience well it's worth it. Even something simple like a $7-15 PDF guide or checklist can add up when you're hitting 100K+ impressions monthly. Test it small before investing too much time.\n\nThe Facebook invite thing is a black box honestly. I wouldn't count on it happening soon. Focus on what you can control right now.",

      "selftext": "I‚Äôm an Automotive Technician with over two decades of experience.  I‚Äôve always worked for a dealership, but recently formed my own business on the side.  I went through all the legalities of doing it the correct way; where I registered with the state and county that I‚Äôm in, got my EIN, and opened a business account.  Once it was all set up, I made a website, leased an office space and started advertising on social media.\n\nIt started out slowly‚Äî after the first 30 days I was questioning whether it was even worth it.  I barely made enough that month to cover business expense.  However, it began to snowball after I landed some mid-tier jobs and started to get 5 star reviews on Google.  Consistent advertising through instagram fueled the fire, while creating content on YouTube on the cars I was working on showcased my skills.\n\nFast forward today and after a short 7 months in operation, I‚Äôve managed to build roughly $38k in business capital‚Äî all net profit.  The jobs I‚Äôm landing are also getting bigger.  I‚Äôm billing out dealership-level work orders and gaining repeat clients to boot.  Most recently; I performed a major engine overhaul on a clients car that was billed out at nearly $7k.  A week later he dropped his other car off with me to get it up to snuff on maintenance and any other repairs it needed.\n\nAs the work becomes consistent, I‚Äôm finding it difficult to juggle both the W2 and my own ‚Äúside business‚Äù‚Ä¶ which as of late I consider more of a full time business than anything‚Äî as all of the free time I have outside of the W2 is dedicated to building the business and scaling it up.  I know at some point, I‚Äôm going to have to choose between the two and I‚Äôm already strategizing how that will play out.  If things continue to accelerate at the pace that it has been, I see myself making the side hustle my main hustle and just picking up a part time job as a bartender or something‚Ä¶ start networking and gaining clients that way.\n\nWhen I formed this business, I had my doubts on whether it would amount to anything.  Now I‚Äôm proud of what it has become and excited to see what it will eventually be.  \n\nBest advice I can give anyone that‚Äôs thinking of starting something on the side is this:  \n\n‚Ä¢Identify what you do best, and capitalize on that and that alone. (I‚Äôm a Mechanic‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt make sense for me to open a food truck).\n\n‚Ä¢Be prepared and put systems in place to keep you organized- keep your books tight.\n\n‚Ä¢Realize there will be monetary risks.  Start small, budget wisely, and don‚Äôt get over leveraged.\n\n‚Ä¢You will make mistakes- learn from them.\n\n‚Ä¢Don‚Äôt chase $, chase client satisfaction and those 5 star reviews.\n\n‚Ä¢The reward reflects the time and effort put in.\n\nHope this was interesting and that it inspires some people.  üîß \n\n",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone\n\nI started a Youtube channel about 3 years ago as a side hustle focused on video games and gaming related content while working a full time job hoping to make a little extra money.\n\nI posted every week or so for about a year and although I met the requirements for views and watch hours I struggled to get the subscribers needed to monetize my channel.\n\nI spent about ‚Ç¨1000 on a good microphone, camera and ring light based on viewer feedback. Also hired a graphic artist to do all the graphics for my page and the ones used in my videos.  Taught myself Davinci Resolve for video editing as well. After about a year with no success I kinda burnt out.\n\nI started posting a few videos again since last week and views and watch time have started to pick up again.\n\nI plan to release a video every week but does someone have advice on how to grow and promote my channel? In particular how to translate all those views and watch hours into subscribers?\n\nI've already done pretty much everything that is usually listed on Google posts on the topic.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Last 4 months  $103.47 (RPM \\~$2.1). \\~5-6 hrs/wk filming/editing.\n* Turo (2022 Prius): 9 days booked last 3 months, gross $358 ‚Üí after Turo fee/insurance/cleaning, net $237; minus a $35 tire patch = $202 take-home. Spent \\~25 minutes scrubbing a stale coffee smell out of the Prius before a pickup - renter no-showed anyway.\n* Task monkey (chrome extension) - funny enough, I tried it on Amazon October Prime Day last week and it got me like $138 back from price drop. Probably the only thing I'd call \"passive income.\"no link/ not affiliated.\n\nHalf a year in, I don't buy the \"work hard and it‚Äôll click\" thing anymore. Most of this stuff is the same tricks with a new label. You put in hours, spend a little cash, and it stalls out. The only money I saw was small and hands-on. Not passive - just extra shifts on a different screen. If you've got something that really pays without babysitting, I'm listening.",

The create once, make money forever line that people throw around is straight up misleading. You‚Äôre constantly updating your products, testing new offers, creating content, managing customers, keeping up with platforms changing their algorithms, and so many things.\n\nThe only thing passive about it is once you‚Äôve done the hard work upfront, built the brand, nailed the marketing, and created something people actually want, it starts to compound. But even then, it‚Äôs more like semipassive.\n\nMost people underestimate how much of a learning curve there is before you even make your first sale. That‚Äôs why I always tell people to treat it like a real business, not a side hack. Because when you do, it actually becomes something sustainable",

So it can be completely passive if you sacrifice part of the profits.\n\nTrading on the market can also be done by companies, but again for a fee, and they will probably trade more conservatively. \n\nVending machines, you can hire employee's who do all the maintenance and refilling. You need a way to make sure they don't steal money though, so you might need to invest in a system that keeps track of how much money is in each machine that can be accessed via 5g. And then hire someone who double checks and maybe also does the accounting.\n\nDigital courses can also be outsourced to someone who does like to make them for a monthly wage and isn't interested in freelancing them. A teacher essentially. Marketing can be outsourced to marketing agency. Might as well have your own elearning platform setup by then.\n\n\nSo yes, for the poor its hard.

Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

I mean, many of the products actually just sell themselves really, but other times, it's literally like pulling teeth.

Then I moved on. Months later I peeked just out of boredom and saw those same pins still sending people my way. I hadn‚Äôt logged in forever. Felt like finding cash in old jeans, but online.\n\nMedium did the same thing. I tossed a couple posts about what I was messing with on Etsy, nothing polished, didn‚Äôt share them anywhere. They somehow kept getting read. Every few weeks I‚Äôd get a tiny ‚Äúyou got paid‚Äù ping and just laugh.\n\nEtsy kept doing its own thing too. Some listings with reviews kept selling.

      "selftext": "Before you downvote, hear me out. I know this sub generally views gambling negatively, but I wanted to share some hard-learned lessons about risk management that actually apply to any form of investing or speculation.\n\nBackground: I'm a software engineer who got into sports betting during COVID. What started as $100 bets quickly escalated, and I ended up wagering about $50k over the course of 2023. I'm up about $3,200 overall, but the real value was learning proper bankroll management principles.\n\nThe Kelly Criterion in Practice: The most important thing I learned was position sizing. In sports betting, there's something called the Kelly Criterion that determines optimal bet size based on your edge and the odds. The formula is:\n\nf = (bp - q) / b\n\nWhere:\n\nf = fraction of bankroll to bet\n\nb = odds received (decimal odds - 1)\n\np = probability of winning\n\nq = probability of losing (1 - p)\n\nReal Example: If I think a team has a 55% chance of winning, but the book is offering +100 odds (50% implied probability), the Kelly formula suggests betting about 10% of my bankroll. Most people would bet way more because \"it's a sure thing.\"\n\nWhat This Taught Me About Regular Investing:\n\n1. Position Sizing Matters More Than Pick Quality Even if you're right 60% of the time, betting too much on any single outcome will eventually ruin you. This applies directly to stock picking or crypto investments.\n\n2. Emotional Control is Everything After a big win, I wanted to bet more. After losses, I wanted to \"chase\" to get even. Sound familiar to anyone who's panic-sold stocks or FOMO'd into crypto?\n\n3. Diversification Isn't Just About Different Assets I learned to spread bets across different sports, bet types, and time periods. The same way you shouldn't put everything in tech stocks, you shouldn't put everything on \"sure thing\" bets.\n\n4. Track Everything I kept detailed records of every bet - amount, reasoning, outcome. This showed me I was actually terrible at NFL betting but good at tennis. Most people don't track their investment performance this granularly.\n\nThe Practical Takeaway: Whether you're buying individual stocks, crypto, or yes, even sports betting, the math of risk management is the same. The Kelly Criterion can help determine position sizes for any investment where you think you have an edge.\n\nTools I Use: For anyone curious, I primarily use bet105 now because their reduced juice (-105 vs standard -110) significantly improves long-term returns. It's like finding an index fund with a 0.1% expense ratio vs 0.5% - small differences compound over time.\n\nThe Bottom Line: I'm not advocating for sports betting as an investment strategy. But the risk management principles I learned apply to everything from stock picking to starting a business. Sometimes the best lessons come from unexpected places. Anyone else learned investing principles from non-traditional sources?",

I have a lot of free time and tried everything I could online to turn minutes into dollars, this is the best thing I've found thats worth your time!\n\nWhen companies create / alter product lines.. they want to get a feel for how to general market will enjoy/dislike the product. Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

In case you are equipped with a smartphone and internet, this is actually the right time to start, provided you are smart about it.\n\nStart learning skills that combine human creativity with AI tools. As an illustration, use ChatGPT or Claude to learn quires like copywriting, marketing, or scriptwriting. Practically you can do everything for free. After that, you can use applications such as CapCut or Canva to create content for small creators or local businesses. You can offer to edit their short videos, write captions, or come up with ideas, all from your phone.\n\nAI is not only taking away jobs but also creating new ones for those who understand it. The majority of creators do not have time to learn these tools, you can be the one who makes it easier for them. Discard the \"get rich quick\" apps, acquire a real skill with AI and use that to buy your first computer. That is how you get out for good.",

          "body": "Building $3,000 per month in passive income will take time, but it‚Äôs absolutely doable if you focus on the right systems and lean into your strengths.\n\nGiven your experience in IT, Agile, and coaching, one of the best places to start is creating and selling digital products based on your knowledge. That could be templates for project planning, Agile sprint boards, training slide decks, or even Notion or Airtable setups for productivity. You can sell these on Gumroad or Etsy. Once created, these digital products can generate income over time without ongoing work.\n\nYou could also consider launching a small online course or coaching bundle. You don‚Äôt need a big production or a huge audience. Even a short workshop or a focused email course can be sold on platforms like Gumroad or Teachable. With your background, people will pay to learn how to manage projects, navigate Scrum roles, or improve productivity in their own teams.\n\nAffiliate marketing is another path worth exploring. You can earn when someone buys through your link, and this works well when you‚Äôre recommending tools you genuinely use or believe in. The key is to learn how to make persuasive content, whether through blog posts, short videos, or email guides, that helps people make a buying decision. I walk through how to do this step by step in my newsletter if you‚Äôre interested.\n\nGiven your love for cooking and healthy living, you could also create a faceless YouTube channel, digital cookbook, or a healthy meal planner. These kinds of content can be monetized through ads, affiliate links, and digital product sales. It‚Äôs not instant, but over time, it can grow into a reliable income stream.\n\nPrint-on-demand could also complement your creative interests. You can design wellness-themed journals, recipe logs, or even merch with positive messages and sell them on platforms like Printful through Etsy.\n\nYou already have the discipline, knowledge, and mindset. Now it‚Äôs just a matter of choosing one or two paths and going deep instead of wide. I break down each of these ideas with examples and tutorials in my newsletter. Feel free to check it out, the link is in my bio.",

Your experience in Agile and project management gives you the structure and consistency most people struggle to build.\n\nIf I were you, I‚Äôd focus on turning what you already know into small, repeatable systems that can run with minimal effort. For example:\n\nDigital courses or templates for Agile and Scrum professionals.¬†You can create things like sprint planners, team-building exercises, or short leadership workshops and sell them automatically.\n\nHealthy lifestyle or productivity printables.¬†You already live that life, so share what works for you through planners, checklists, or habit trackers.\n\nAffiliate blogs or newsletters.¬†Start one around self-improvement or healthy living and use affiliate links for tools or books you already recommend.\n\nWorkshops that turn into self-paced products.¬†Host a few short sessions, record them, and sell them later as evergreen content.\n\nThe easiest way to get started is to build one thing that earns $100 a month and then stack it. Thirty small, consistent earners will reach your goal. Focus on creating simple, useful products and automating everything possible.\n\nIt might take a few months to build momentum, but with your mindset and skill set, it is absolutely within reach.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training glfrom beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free! At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

Most of them are just selling guides or courses, and *that's* how they make their money not from the methods they‚Äôre advertising. They prey on people hoping for easy cash, selling info that should honestly be free.\n\nThe truth is, people who are actually making money don‚Äôt usually need to prove it, because they‚Äôre not trying to sell you anything. I‚Äôve personally been making money through affiliate marketing for the past 18 years. It *does* work, but it‚Äôs not instant, and it definitely takes effort to learn and grow.

Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

Trust, my cousin landed a great job oppurtunity by knowing to code GO in Munich. I know it's not passive income but it could might help you in the long run.",

Prolific apparently has a waitlist but I will reccomend it to everybody. Its legitimate and will always be helpful if you're looking for some side money with little time. DA, well. Look it up, decide if its for you. There's a lot of time investment upfront taking the tests and getting in. After that, it's longer time commitments, like at least an hour at a time to do things.

I have a lot of free time and tried everything I could online to turn minutes into dollars, this is the best thing I've found thats worth your time!\n\nWhen companies create / alter product lines.. they want to get a feel for how to general market will enjoy/dislike the product. Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

When I could finally login, my task queue was completely empty, as well as my job history/applied jobs etc. I can't even edit my payment or job information. \n\nIs someone else experimenting this? I've tried to fix the problem by clearing my cookies and such, but I can't simply log in to work on my task queue. I am a little baffled because the communication with my project team has been really good, and I haven't received any offboarding email...

I made a few posts on Reddit, asking about ad networks tailored for tool sites.\n\nThe CEO of Mediavine eventually reached out and put me in touch with his team. \n\nThat said, I won't be onboarded onto Mediavine for now but one of their other ad networks, which is called PubNation (any experience with PubNation is greatly appreciated). \n\nAs the tool site continues to grow, so will hopefully my access to better ad products. \n\nI also hope that enabling ads will allow me to make more money on the [desktop app](https://www.terrific.tools/terrific-tools-desktop) since purchasing the license will also grant users an ad-free experience on the main website. \n\nMoreover, I also started releasing some improvements to the desktop app. I will go full-time on our other SaaS and the tool site by the end of the year, so hopefully can get those out more frequently. \n\nLastly, I [finally added Google authentication](https://x.com/onlinedopamine/status/1966209490727932397) to the tool site, which allowed me to double my signups in a month. Not sure if all of those are legit but at least I now have a growing email list I can tap into eventually. ",

      "selftext": "I've been searching on the web for a while, trying to find something I can do to gain financial stability to get to my dream goal of building a dog training facility.  I am 28f, with a few medical issues that I want to overcome.  I am passionate in training dogs, birds, cats, and overall love listening to others.  I truly love to people part of dog training.  I have 14 years of education in dog training, learning under multiple mentors. Many people have told me I need to write a book about my life and that I give great life advice because of what my medical conditions have put me through.  I feel a lot of people look up to me, though I strongly feel inadequate in that realm.  I want to blog about my journey to success.\n\nThe best thing is I have massive support to get through this, in the sense of, stable housing without needing to work, disability income (that I wish to work towards going off), and overall emotional support of my friends.  With that said, my goals are:\n\n* To build inspiration in others who are in my shoes or in similar situations.  Create guides on how to grow a business that works around their chronic illness(es).\n* Share my story in a book that encompasses life lessons I have learned along the way.\n* Eventually sell products (like t-shirts, buttons, patches) that bring awareness and possibly create a non-profit to help people in my shoes.\n* Start public speaking about my journey and how I conquered my medical conditions.\n* Eventually, **create my own dog training and boarding business** as that's my biggest passion (this has a huge startup cost, so I need a way to make the money)\n\nWith that said, my biggest setback is really just my medical conditions.  They are neurological, and after an injury, my brain struggles to learn information, but that's getting better.  I have struggled with the next steps after figuring out my goals, such as, what I need to learn to accomplish this and the basic steps to get started.  It all seems overwhelming, but I know once the ball gets rolling I will figure it all out.  My biggest inspiration is Temple Grandin. I am autistic and an extremely visual and hands on learner.\n\nAny advice, words of wisdom, or guidance would be much appreciated.",

Great advantage of yours is that you are an expert in the field and would have no problems writing content.\n\nI looked up some blogs that have success (they are in Mediavine, an advertisement company that shows media ads on your website). Take a look and see if you capable of creating content like them:\n- dogtrainingme .com\n- peachonaleash .com\n- prettyfluffy .com\n- littledogtips .com\n- bigdogmom .com\n- fidoseofreality .com\n- ottertailkennels .com\n- Dogtraining .world\n- wearwagrepeat .com\n\n\nThere are actually many more, like a good dozen more.\n\n\nAs for earning a buck from it, there are:\n1. lead generation (for dog training places?)\n2. affiliate products (leashes and stuff on amazon, amazon shares 3% in pet niche as I can see from their website https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/node/topic/GRXPHT8U84RAYDXZ)\n3. ads from companies like ezoic/mediavine/raptive. I think ads would not be the greatest income stream, more like $500 of passive income. Earnings depend on niche, pet niche doesn‚Äôt seem to bring much, may be like $8 ish per thousand. Those websites mentioned above have like 30/40/50k visitors a month if similarweb .com and ahref .com do not lie.\n\nMe myself go with 2nd and 3rd income streams. (Cause it‚Äôs inconvenient for me to work with small entrepreneurs whom I would bring leads for, cause I am living abroad and things are complicated). You on the other hand can have great success with it.\n\nWhat time period should you dedicate to it? You‚Äôll need like a year, a year and a half. And during this time all you do is constantly writing blog posts. You would write 2 posts a week on average. If you will have struggles writing content, I can explain my technic, it is soulless and mechanic, but does the job.\n\nHow many blog posts do you need? Depends on the niche and your approach, (I aim for 350-700). but let‚Äôs take your potential competition:\n- Dogtrainingme has ~530 posts\n- Peachonaleash ~50 posts (and lots of pages dedicated to events)\n- Prettyfluffy ~500 posts\n- Wearwagrepeat ~400 posts (plus 300 podcast transcripts/announcements)\n\nSo, you got the idea. You would need lots of posts. Posts‚Äô quality you can judge on your own.",

      "selftext": "ok so for context ive been doing this for about 3 years now. startups bring me in when shit hits the fan - not the \"we ran out of money\" fan, the \"our product literally cannot scale and we have no idea why\" fan\n\nand theres this pattern that shows up EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.\n\nmonth 1-6: everything is great. moving fast, shipping features, customers are happy, lifes good\n\nmonth 7-12: things start slowing down. weird bugs popping up. \"we'll fix it later\" becomes the team motto\n\nmonth 13-18: you literally cannot add a new feature without breaking 3 old ones. every deploy is stressful\n\nmonth 19-24: youve now hired 3 more engineers and theyre just maintaining the existing mess. not building anything new\n\nmonth 25+: rebuild from scratch or watch your startup die in slow motion\n\n**what i found in those 47 codebases:**\n\nlike 89% had zero database indexing. ZERO. your app is slow because youre searching through 100,000 records on every single request. thats not a bug thats just... why\n\n76% were paying for like 8x more servers than they needed. the average is 13% utilization - youre paying for 100 servers and using 13 of them. burning $3k-15k a month for nothing\n\n68% had auth vulnerabilities that would make any security person have a panic attack\n\n91% had no automated tests at all. so every new feature is literally russian roulette\n\n**the math on this is depressing:**\n\navg engineer salary is like $120k right stripe did research showing devs spend 42% of time dealing with bad code so for a team of 4 over 3 years thats $600k+ just... wasted. on maintaining garbage then add $200-400k to rebuild plus 6-12 months of lost revenue during the rebuild total damage per company: $2-3M\n\nand founders dont realize until month 18-24. by then youve raised series A based on growth that is about to completely fall apart\n\n**what actually prevents this:**\n\nhonestly just spend 2 weeks on architecture before writing code. i know its boring and you wanna ship fast but those 2 weeks save you 18 months of hell\n\nthink \"what breaks at 10,000 users\" not \"what works for 100 users\" - your db queries, file uploads, background jobs, everything needs to handle 100x day one\n\nautomate tests from the start. if you cant click one button and know nothing broke youre just gambling\n\npick boring tech. react/node/postgres is boring and thats GOOD. you can hire for it, theres stackoverflow answers, it doesnt randomly die at 2am\n\nget someone whos done this to review your architecture in WEEK ONE. not month 12 when its too late\n\n**the part nobody wants to hear:**\n\nmost technical cofounders and first eng hires are really good at coding but have never architected something that scales. its like being a great cook but never running a restaurant kitchen during dinner rush\n\nreal example from last month - saas company spending $47k/month on aws\n\ni did a 3 day review and found:\n\n* running 40 servers when they needed 6\n* storing files in literally the most expensive way possible\n* db queries taking 4 seconds that should take 40 milliseconds\n\nnew bill: $8,200/month\n\nthey saved $38,800 PER MONTH. thats $465k a year. for 3 days of work.\n\n**why im posting this**\n\nbecause im tired of watching founders burn 18 months and $500k-2M learning lessons that are completely avoidable\n\n\"move fast break things\" works when youre facebook with unlimited money. for your startup its just suicide\n\n**if youre building something right now ask yourself:**\n\n* what breaks at 10x current users?\n* do you have automated tests?\n* can your db handle 100x the queries?\n* would your infrastructure cost $50k/month at 10k users?\n\nif you said \"i dont know\" to any of these youre building on quicksand\n\nhappy to answer questions about tech stack or architecture stuff in comments. ive seen this movie too many times. \n\nMeir Avimelec Davidov (You can search me over linkedin)  \nFounder &amp; CEO of gliltech software",

      "selftext": "My previous startup had a long name - Copilot2trip. Even our team shortened it to \"c2t\" in calls because nobody wanted to say the full thing.\n\nFor my next project, Linkedin content AI tool, I went radically short: 2pr\n\nHere's what happened. When you give an extremly short and meaningless name, people instinctively add the domain when they mention it. They say \"2pr\\[.\\]io\" instead of just \"2pr\" because saying just \"2pr\" sounds awkward or unclear. (hopefully moderators will get that is not a link but core feature of the post/story)\n\nThat becomes a clickable hyperlink automatically.\n\nMost of our signups come from direct links now. People share the name in Slack channels, LinkedIn comments, Reddit threads. Word-of-mouth converts into clickable links without any extra effort.\n\nMade $4500 last month and a 80% of that came from people just dropping the name in conversations.\n\nIf you're venture-backed with a marketing budget, you probably want a memorable brand name like Mistral or Clay.\n\nBut if you're bootstrapping and need scrappy distribution, super short plus meaningless might actually be a hack.\n\nGeniunly, I can't understand why this growth hack idea is not so widely cited or shared",

However, when something wasn't going right they were the biggest pain in the ass. One time, we didn't have the right business license in this state we were about to do a show in and it was 4:30PM on a Friday, one of my dedicated people (but not good at sales) called up the local license place and they said they had already closed for the day and she went and found a neighbouring town, called them up and begged them to stay open for a few extra minutes took a cab and drove out there and got the license. All without needing me to handhold her and she knew she didn't have time to wait for my permission but she also knew the show wouldn't happen without it. \n\nSo we worked on her weaknesses and I spent extra time training her and eventually just started hiring sales people to work under her because the amount of peace of mind I had with her was still worth it.",

There are clients with 10m+ subs getting less than 100k views now. So, its clear, AI will kill jobs in code generation and content creation.\n\nWhat exactly is going to pay everyone's bills??? Id love to know how everyone else is handling this.\n\nedit: a lot of comments are underestimating the magnitude of this. These are not just random people that will be directly or indirectly affected. It will be fathers and mothers. Brothers and sisters. Sons and daughters. And to those that think they are immune to AI, like mechanics, when people lose their jobs/incomes, they typically dont keep 2-3 cars.\n\nedit: apparently China waited for the markets to close before telling DJT we aren't getting those gpus.

But I would say absolutely not everyone should have cards, and every charge should be authorized by someone who is looking at the transactions every month. You can then categorize things like how much should we spend on software, how much did we spend on business meals, how much did we spend on advertising dollars, and then you can see where you need to watch out. This also will help you with your taxes. \n\nOnce you get into a groove, most expenses should be predictable and recurring. This is actually a great use for AI. You can export your transactions and create a project for expense review. For example you have a long list including things like:\n\nAsana\nEverhour\nGoogle Workspace\nSEMRush\nSupermetrics \n\nSo you tell the GPT what to expect and what‚Äôs normal, and then every month you upload it and say tell me what charges are out of the ordinary and anything that‚Äôs changing, something like that.",

You have to decide you‚Äôll make it happen no matter what, that you‚Äôd rather go broke chasing it than live comfortably working for someone else.\n\nIt takes 13 hour days, relentless hustle, and a mindset that borders on delusion while people smile and nod with half hearted support.

Had a business partner, my boyfriend and later got married. 1.5 years later expanded to 1100sq ft. 14 years later, 2006 we sold the shop and moved out of the country. 2000 we broke ground and build a resort in Greece. In 2007 moved back and rebuilt in a nearby neighborhood of our original location where clients can find us again. We continued to build the resort abroad. 2008 the housing crisis hurt the business. We shifted from having employees to transitioning them to rental stylists. 2016 our marriage suffered. 2018 we closed the shop, divorced and I went on my own to continue to grow and shift the business model.

It‚Äôs 2AM, the house is silent, and you‚Äôre tweaking a landing page that no one‚Äôs going to see for weeks. You start questioning everything. Last week I was deep in that spiral and ended up jumping on jackpot city streams just to hear people talk about literally anything else. Random chatter, dumb jokes it pulled me out of my own head for a while.  \nI love building, but yeah, it‚Äôs lonely as hell sometimes. How do you stay sane during the grind?",

Writing a business plan¬†*feels*¬†productive. It's concrete. You can show your parents and they'll nod approvingly. But it's also the world's most elaborate procrastination technique.\n\nHere's the thing - your business plan is going to be wrong. Not slightly off.¬†*Catastrophically*¬†wrong. Because you're essentially writing fiction about a market you haven't actually entered yet.\n\nWant to know if your idea works? Find three people who will pay you money for it. Not \"yeah that sounds cool\" people. Not your cousin who promises to buy it when you launch. Actual humans who open their wallets.\n\nThose three customers will teach you more in a week than six months of planning ever could. They'll tell you what features actually matter, what price point works, and which of your assumptions were completely backwards.\n\nThe business plan can come later, after you've proven someone actually wants what you're selling. Until then, you're just writing expensive fan fiction about your own startup.\n\nAm I wrong, or are we all just allergic to actual validation?",

Honestly it's just frustrating, Here's hoping that frustration eats me alive enough To push me forward. And just make the move to reach out to a few people,(or a lot of fucking people) And find someone that's willing to actually buy. It does feel like an endless list of things to learn though, Like I seen many people mention Google ads, Running through Reddit forums, finding communities wherever they may be, And selling it to them there. But all I hear when I read that is \"well that's another thing to kind of learn or figure out how to approach\".

In person networking - most b2b sales will come because of a referral, and doing in person networking.  Our first client actually came from a referral for a man I had helped 2 years earlier.  He had me on his email list so I decided to reach back out to him and share with him what we were offering, quickly saw the value and connected me with several of his clients which all signed on to our services.  We then started attending different networking groups.  The key here is that not a ton of direct sales happen from in person networking.  What happens is you build your referral base from networking and then they refer clients to you.  \n\n2. We read some books that showed us our marketing message was so good. Specifically Story Branding and Star with Why.  They helped so much.  Once we realized our messaging was wrong and updated it we started getting more and more traction from our networking.  \n\nI think most ppl ignore in person networking bc they are building an ‚Äúonline business‚Äù but if you are doing 2b2 it‚Äôs so key!",

You are selling solutions to their problems, and outcomes, not services and just skills. Ideally, this varies per industry target, per lead source, per partnership type.

          "body": "You‚Äôre not alone here, but the real issue isn‚Äôt your technical ability. It‚Äôs how you‚Äôre communicating your value. Most engineers try to sell what they do instead of what it means for the client‚Äôs business. Small clinics don‚Äôt care about data centers or infrastructure. They care about uptime, compliance, and how much productivity they lose when things break.\n\nIf you lead with ‚ÄúI design enterprise-grade infrastructure,‚Äù you‚Äôll lose them immediately. But if you say, ‚ÄúI help healthcare practices eliminate downtime and avoid compliance risks through secure, high-availability networks,‚Äù now you‚Äôre speaking their language. You‚Äôre connecting your service to a tangible pain point instead of a technical feature.\n\nI‚Äôd also rethink your outreach approach. Cold calling small businesses usually fails because they don‚Äôt understand the value yet. Try partnering with MSPs, compliance consultants, or IT service providers who already have relationships with your ideal clients. Offer to take on the complex networking or cloud projects they prefer to refer out. One good partnership can do more than months of random outreach.\n\nFinally, start showing proof of expertise. Write short case studies or even quick LinkedIn posts about common mistakes you fix. Something like ‚Äúhow one clinic lost a day of patient data because of a bad firewall setup‚Äù or ‚Äúhow we reduced downtime by 80% with a small infrastructure tweak.‚Äù That type of content builds quiet authority and creates inbound interest over time.\n\nThe technical part isn‚Äôt what holds most consultants back. It‚Äôs learning how to translate that skill into business outcomes that decision makers actually care about. Once you do that, traction starts to come naturally.",

Takes time maybe a few years to get some good results.\n\nThere are a few options.\n\n1) hire a sales consultant from a organisational or business development firm\n\n2) hire a sales staff with at least 3 to 5 years experience.  Part time maybe?  To get the ball rolling and then moving on to full time once he has steadied the business coming in.\n\n3) learn it yourself.  It's difficult to do on your own, I had the support of organisation and other staff, management etc.  This is because you have an idea that it is the sales side but still not sure because of lack of experience.  Thus the learning curve that takes at least 3 months speaking to 20 people a day to even get one sale can be especially daunting. \n\nfind other ways to get leads, marketing and advertising.  But when the leads come in, you still have to sell.  And if you haven't got the skill you might waste quite a few marketing dollars. It most likely will take 3 months to get your first sale.  Not counting the sale from beginners luck.  This is generally from a warm lead.\n\nFrom what I heard more and more b2b companies are using less and less cold calling.",

It's frustrating when you know you can deliver but can't get the first conversation. Your expertise isn't the issue, it's how you position it to your clients.\n\nHere's my take:\n\n1. Reframe from IT consultant to Problem Solver. Talking about data center and enterprise networking to small business owners sounds expensive and complex. They just want to know if your solutions can make their internet faster, stop their system from crashing etc. Repackage your offer around their core anxieties like reliability, security and simplicity.\n2. Stop Cold Calling and Start Building Trust. Cold calling is like charging a fortified wall without intelligence, it rarely works unless you are a sales prodigy. Instead, provide value first. Offer a free, simple network check-up or be the helpful person in the online forums and local business groups who answers IT questions. Don't sell, just help. Let them see you as an Ally.\n3. Find Partners, not just Clients. Your fastest path to clients is through partnerships. Reach out to Managed Service Providers, web developers or cybersecurity firms. They already have the trust of your target clients and often run into projects that are too complex for them, which is what you solve. propose a referral partnership.\n\nYou have the expertise. Now it's about layering on the trust and positioning. Once you are a trusted voice, your clients will come.\n\n(Source: I guide leaders on market engagement and write about these principles in \"The Strategic Treatise\", I will be starting a weekly \"Insight First Clinic\" on Reddit to break down problems like this.)",

Small clinics don't need connectivity and infrastructure design at enterprise scale. You're pitching high-end services to businesses that probably just need basic IT support.\n\nOur clients in IT consulting learned that enterprise networking clients aren't found through cold calls to random small businesses. They come from referrals, partnerships with MSPs who need specialist help, or targeting mid-sized companies actually doing infrastructure projects.\n\nData center and cloud infrastructure work goes to companies with 100 plus employees, serious tech budgets, and existing IT teams. Those deals come through warm intros, industry connections, or subcontracting with bigger consulting firms. Not cold calling dentist offices.\n\nIf you want small business clients, pivot your services. Offer managed IT support, cybersecurity assessments, cloud migrations for Office 365. That's what SMBs actually pay for. The enterprise networking stuff you're good at is overkill for their needs.\n\nBetter approach is partner with IT service providers who already work with your target clients. Offer to handle their complex networking projects when they need specialist help. You get clients, they get to serve their customers better without hiring full-time network engineers.\n\nJoin local tech groups, attend industry meetups, get to know other IT consultants and MSPs. Referrals and partnerships are how consulting businesses actually grow, not cold outreach to businesses who don't need what you're selling.\n\nFour months with zero traction means your targeting is wrong, not that you suck at sales.

The ones that launched as 'AI startups' without a clear use case usually pivot or die within 6 months. On pricing: the successful ones charge for outcomes or time saved, not per AI call.

We ended up having to hire +/- 20 transcriptionists, managing a team, and build all the infrastructure (contracts, onboarding, communications, accounting system, etc) and on the weekends, or at night, we worked on automating some of our processes to become more efficient the next week.\n5 years later, we are still 20-25 people, have a real strong tech stack, and produce 5x more than our initial capacity in much less time. \nAt first, our AI was Dragon from Nuance.\nNow it‚Äôs a combination of all the major providers you know + our special recipe tested and improved over time.\n\nIt was a huge challenge to build.

Can you give me actionable instructions on how I can escape it too?\n\nI'll give you details about a couple of things I've done to change my circumstances and my current environment.\n\nI put a TON of effort into learning software development. I know how to build apps and websites. I have built a lot of apps and websites. Some use ads to earn money. Some require payment but my main problem is no one knows about the things I've built because I can't afford to pay for advertisement. I have posted details about the things I've built in startup drectories but that didn't help much.\n\nI got a degree in Electronic Engineering and a Masters in Computer Science but then realized that... There are no jobs in my country. That is not a joke. I wrote an app to automate the process of applying to jobs and now I agree with my peers in my country that no one is hiring.\n\nI don't have rich relatives I can get investment money from.\n\nI have tried getting work on upwork and freelancer but they expect me to pay to get work.\n\nI'm considering joining the army, though I'm afraid I might not have the heart to kill a fellow human.\n\nSo... What would you do if you were in my shoes. How would you change your circumstances?",

Keep learning, keep building, and keep improving your craft. You never know which project, connection, or opportunity will change your trajectory.

      "selftext": "Im 34 years old with a Mechanical engineering degree. I have been in corporate world since 2017 mainly in manufacturing, maintenance and facility engineering, and management experience. Ive done really cool things and built a pretty solid resume. Money has been great but im generally burned out. I several years back that I don't get fulfillment out of working for others but I stayed in the trap. I have my first child otw and I decided to leave a extremely well paying job with great benefits due to a horrible culture which honestly was turning into the worst version of myself. Hind sight, I believe i should have stayed at least until the baby was born and took my paternity leave but i figured if i didnt leave i probably never would. After i left in july, I started my own facilities and equipment consulting business. Ive been struggling on how to get things started even though I have the llc, website, business cards etc. I also dont really know how to sale, if that makes sense. I feel like im losing the fire thats in me that makes me, me. I believe i also have too much ego and pride that has been holding me back for the majority of my life, which i take full responsibility for. The burnout and loss of confidence honestly is tearing me apart as I have a pregnant wife and baby due in 3 weeks. We have a decent nest egg of savings but its tearing me apart as a man. How do I get the drive back and push through to do the one thing ive been wanting to do for years, which is have a business and work for myself. I understand there will be stress in any environment and im willing to grind through, no stranger to hard work. Has anyone experienced this and successfully started there business? Any advice is greatly appreciated. \n\nAlso to add, about 4 years ago we relocated to atlanta for my job and isolated our selves from all friends and family. I didnt realize how much of an impact it would have on me not being social and not having a team in your corner rooting for you. Again, this is all on me and having something to prove to myself at the time. My goal now is to be a good father, husband,  and to have fulfillment in my life with whatever job or business I do.",

But I think you know very well that in a year this shit won't matter.\n\nSo, don't take what I write below as advice, just thoughts from a random guy, because I'm not in your place and context, and giving life advice to others is a type of egomania.\n\nFirst thought about ego. Somewhere here you wrote that you set ego aside. I call this ‚Äúkilling the ego,‚Äù and this is one of the most important things for building a business, because when ego guides you, you risk missing out on very attractive opportunities that could hurt your ego. So you've already taken an important step toward your venture.\n\nSecond thought about focus. Someone here already wrote that you try to solve a lot of problems. It's okay, but you really should focus on only one thing. It seems your family, because the main purpose is to be a good father and husband. Leave all the other stuff for a couple of months, spend more time with your wife and after birth with both of them. I assume she understands your mood and worries the same as you. Your business will still be there, especially as I understand you have some resources to not work for a while. Let this time with your family be your reset",

He bought an industrial electrical contractor. He updated some things, built really good relationships inside the company, and has been refining his team for years. I see him stress from time to time but two days ago I met him at his lake house and helped take his boat out of the water. He's fielding calls while we're doing it, but he manages it well. He and his family just came back from South Africa for a 2 week safari. He gets to do a lot that most people don't, and it does come at a cost.¬†\nSome other thoughts:\nHe and I trade entrepreneur podcasts constantly. Alex Hormozi is a great one for business and specifically sales marketing. That may help.\nMake sure you're exercising. When I get mega stressed it's usually because I haven't moved or stretched in a while. Guard your health like your life depends on it.¬†\nStarting a business usually fails for most because they give up after the first try. The first try often does not go well.¬†\nIf you're having trouble selling hire a guy. If you can't afford to hire him, give him a fat commission. All the good guys I know are 100% commission¬†\nGet a good job for now.¬† Keep that job and run your business on the side until you get some sales coming in and you can't afford to keep your regular job. Try and get a remote job.¬†\nAbove all else: take care of your wife. Your kid will feel the tension in your relationship. You have to be the best husband to be the best father.¬†\nGood luck and love that kiddo up. You can do this.¬†",

I've always been happy to help him out, but last week, things took a turn.\n\nHe came in on a Saturday, and I had to tell him I couldn't give him a free burger because I was running low on product. I offered him a side of fries instead, but he lost his temper and started cussing at me. He claimed I was 'full of shit' and that I had plenty of product, which wasn't true.\n\nAs the owner, I'm used to dealing with difficult customers, but this guy's behavior was unacceptable. I yelled at him to leave and told him not to come back.\n\nI know some of you might think I'm a jerk for cutting him off, but honestly, I feel like he took advantage of my kindness for too long. Has anyone else had to deal with a similar situation? How did you handle it?",

But we're known for our produce (and we're also a SNAP retailer) so it's a necessity. Produce has different phases: A Grade, B Grade, Free Grade, Piggy Grade, and Compost. We don't have enough B Grade to warrant a trip out to a food rescue organization so we started a \"free table\" where we would put unsellable but still edible produce and other items. Folks from all tax brackets would take from the free table but most importantly: food insecure folks could take from it without having to feel awkward about it.\n\nWell this one unhoused guy decided it was his personal buffet and would eat from it all day. I started offering him bags to take anything he wanted to go. He decided that outside of our store was his home. He would try to come in after closing hours to ask for more free food. One time, I was working from inside the locked store (lights were off and blinds were down) and I felt someone staring at me. I looked up and he was bent down so he could stare at me from under the blinds. That was the first time I called the cops.\n\nWe stopped putting out the free produce for a while because he creeped us out so much (for a multitude of reasons). Customers expressed disappointment so when we hadn't seen the creeper for a long while, we decided to bring it back. Well then creeper man got out of jail and resumed his antics. I was setting up the table and ran into him and we had a nice conversation where he seemed sober + thanked me for feeding him. I offered him a to go bag and he informed me that he was planning on hanging out because he likes it in front of my store. I very politely gave a reason for why he should hang out in one of the more comfortable spots in the area and he went ballistic. I tried to deescalate the situation and he threatened to kill me. I called the cops again, got a different officer, who informed me that sometimes people say things they don't mean.\n\nSince the cops don't care about the safety of my team + my neighbors, the free table is gone permanently and the good free stuff goes to the unhoused people in the neighborhood who periodically check in on us to make sure creeper man hasn't been bothering us.",

Standard stuff like lawn maintenance, seasonal cleanups, mulching, the usual.\n\nAbout 8 months ago I had this one client who kept asking if I could pressure wash their driveway while I was already there doing their yard. I said sure whatever, charged them like $75 extra just to not deal with scheduling another visit. Took me maybe 30 mins.\n\nWord got around I guess because then other clients started asking. I figured why not, easy add on right? Fast forward to now and I'm getting calls specifically for pressure washing. Like people don't even want the landscaping part anymore they just want their driveways, decks, house siding done.\n\nDid the math last week and the pressure washing stuff brought in almost double what the landscaping did last month. I've got some money saved up from the busy season so I could buy better equipment and actually pivot to this full time but it feels weird abandoning what I started with?\n\nAnyone else deal with something like this where a side thing accidentally became the main thing?

I was desperate to grow a portfolio to the point I started offering my services for free.\n\nStill no one accepted my services. After 3 months I got immediately burnt out and ended all operations until my one client that I kept told me that I could actually make a living doing my services.\n\nI didn't want to hear it and told them fuck no I hated everything I did for my llc. My client then told me \"You can chose what services you offer.\" That's when I gave it another go.\n\nHowever, I remember what this subreddit said to me and instead of going back to my llc, I completely rebranded, decided that I'm never going to create a portfolio or run ads. I came up with a brand true to me, an awkward autistic woman.\n\nAnd it worked.

I moved to a new city last year and in my old city there was a big scene for marketers with meetups and conferences every week, so I wanted to start something similar here. \n\nI spent $100 on the venue, $100+ on catering, spent money on flyers, and spent a lot of time making the presentation I was going to give, hanging up flyers at dozens of local businesses, meeting business owners, and promoting on meetup.com, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. Several people RSVP'd and I had close to 50 people interested or saying they would come including my friends. I promoted the event with my small team every day for 5 weeks sending reminders just enough to not be annoying. \n\nI got there and set everything up and... nothing. No one came. One person had been asking me questions on meetup named Curtis and I saw one person there who looked like him so I went up to say hello and introduced myself and he looked at me strange and said his name was Shawn and it was nice to meet me. SO AWKWARD. I casually played it off and left him alone, then waited 30+ minutes after the start time by the front door of the venue like some kind of 1970's breakup song to see if anyone would show before packing up my stuff and going home. \n\nNext month I was planning a follow up and was going to have a guest speaker come out, but now I'm thinking of emailing him (a respected name in my field) and canceling next month because it would embarrass me even more. \n\nMaybe Thursday nights aren't good? Maybe 6:30pm is a bad time for a business event? Maybe my offer wasn't good enough? Maybe something else was going on last night that I didn't know about? Maybe I should have tried paid ads on the radio or Facebook instead? Maybe I should try changing it to Saturday and pay a big name to appear? Maybe this town isn't interested in marketing and I need to try the big city 30 minutes away?\n\nI guess I'm just venting into the void here. I used to be in bands and I've definitely played shows where no one came, so this is nothing new, but it's never fun to go through it. \n\n\n\nI realize I'm not good at in-person event promotion and need to keep trying things until I make progress.",

We've been working all day and want to relax in a chill setting. Take a few minutes at some point to thank any sponsors, caterers, etc. Ask for feedback for future events, and ask people to think about who they would invite to the next one to make this better for everyone. If you tell me theres a speaker and it starts at 5:30, if I cant make it on time, im not going to show up AT ALL. (LOL show up late in the middle of a speaker's presentation? How embarrassing! Sorry I couldn't make it!)\n\n\n- Make it a networking event where they can promote themselves and their business, and mingle with other professionals. If you make it 5-7, people can drift in and out. Some people can leave work early, some will show up late, and people can come and go as they please.\n\n\n- I need to stress this needs to be an opportunity for the networkers to meet new people and expand into new markets. The main attraction needs to be the attendees. All the successful independent networking events I go to do this. The host NEVER spends time peddling their own product; they go mingle and build relationships just like everyone else has to. Don't worry, people will remember you and that you hosted the events.\n\n\n- See if you can find a venue you can pay for where drinks are available. A slower night at a restaurant with a bar or something. Buy some appetizers but tell everyone to support your host and buy a drink! Give the venue host a minute to speak if they want.\n\n- As you grow ask if people have swag or door prizes to donate. Put business cards in a bowl for drawings (must be present to win, keeps some people there longer). \"We have a gift card here for a free 30 minute massage from Queen Spa.\" \"Up next is a branded tumbler from Reddit Bank and trust!\" \"A floral arrangement made by Flowers Unlimited, donated as a prize from Care Today Urgent Care. Thank you Care Today for this lovely prize. Let's see who's taking it home!\"\n\nTL;DR: no speakers, make it easy to come and go, find a venue (and give the venue an opportunity to make money aka the bar, also buy some appetizers), and focus is on the people attending. This is for them and about them.\n\nP.S. take this with a grain of salt I am tall, white, and handsome. Sample size of 1 and a lot of those factors probably play more into that than my actual ability.\n\nP.P.S. I'm not saying I'm handsome as a brag. I just realized its a factor, and I found out because when my wife goes with me to networking events, she extends her hand to shake the hand of EVERY SINGLE OTHER WOMAN that approaches us at light speed. \"Hi I'm xxx, Hailhydra's wife. Nice to meet you.\" Before she did this, other women ive known a long time through networking would come up and we'd give each other a hug. She put a stop to that quick lol.\n\nP.P.P.S my mom said I was handsome too. So sample size of...2?",

I'm a freelance developer who works on contract, and this is the first year I've had difficulty finding clients in... well, since the 2008 crash. \n\nThe first thing I would do is split up finding people to hire, and finding new clients. These are two separate things to tackle. \n\nMeetups for fellow developers and potential hires are going to be a lot easier to accomplish in my opinion, and those can be done online; because in our industry, pretty much everything can be done remotely. \n\nIf you really want to build a solid in-person event, I think you really need to have an established client list. Invite them to thank them for their business, and ask them to bring other community members.\n\nIf you're good, in this economy, at finding new clients and new work, you will absolutely figure this out.

Gather way more feedback from people who match your target attendee persona. \n\nFrankly, I'm more of a fan of pitching the idea in detail and then getting people to pay for a ticket in advance before you even start setting up the event. Try Reddit, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.. \n\nIn this way, if it flops, you've wasted no time and money, saved yourself a lot of effort and heartbreak, and ruled out that particular event idea. You can validate ideas and demand in this way without wasting money, time, effort, and other resources.\n\nHowever, I'm not familiar with in-person events.

Saying this so you can understand I might know quite a bit about what is going on here.\n\nFor people saying 6:30 is too late, I completely disagree. It's actually the most perfect time you could be doing it. All of my events are either at Lunch OR 6:30pm.\n\nSo several things. 1. If the goal of the event is to talk to people and you had Curtis already reaching out and asking questions why not just jump on a call with him? That to me, feels like an immediate win with a lot of upside. Even giving you the immediate ability to pitch something.\n\n2. Your venue will absolutely make or break your event. Pubs will always have extremely low turn out. Especially if you are Targeting professionals. Want to know where you can have meetups that won't cost you anything? Coffee shops like Panera Bread.\n\nMy first several meetups were at Paneras or Starbucks and once I grew the groups to around 30 people consistently coming out, I was able to use that to get bigger venues to donate the space, like co-working spaces. Especially if you have people in tech or marketers because they love having remote offices they can work out of. Best part, Panera is free. They just want folks there to buy snacks or coffee. So you save all of that money alone. Several hundred dollars in your pocket now.\n\nI am a very big believer in Value for time and a meetup will break if you don't figure out what that looks like. What is the value for their time being there, driving there, and then driving home. If they are THINKING about driving there and can't figure out what the value is, they will just make a turn and go home instead of going there.\n\nHope this gives you some ideas and if you want to DM me or reach out to ask more, happy to explain more.",

Which make just be too expensive of customer acquisition cost. I think you‚Äôre cooked tbh, as far as growth. \n\nThe changes to the SEO probably killed your whole current growth model. You were likely able to really maximize the bang for your buck under the old structure, and no one except google is going to know for sure why it changed and/or what you can do about it.\n\nYou would not be at all the first to have this problem after a major update. Any time this happens, some companies get crushed. It might be possible to recover, but also possible you just had the perfect mix of whatever factors mattered. As time goes on, people will know better, but then as more people know, they‚Äôll change it again. \n\nSo you can keep spending money on SEO and consultants, but you‚Äôll probably just burn it all.

For me its being friends with my competitors. Sounds backwards but theres like 4 other small eco cleaning businesses in my area and we sort of help each other. Like share supplier info or warn about sketchy deals and refer customers when we can't help them. One told me about a logistics company that cut my shipping by 30% and another saved me from a supplier who doesn't reply after first orders.  \n  \nBig chains dont hurt us much since our customers want local and they always complain stuff isnt in stock there anyway.

          "body": "Yes! Leadership in general is a muscle that needs to grow in the beginning but firing is always hard. My mentor always said the day firing is easy is the day you shouldn't be a leader. You need to make the right decision for your business but it's not easy knowing that person is losing their job. Especially in a small business, you more than likely know their family or at least know about them.  We should always maintain our compassion.\n\nThis is probably my driving force behind hiring very carefully, because I haaaate terminating. I like using interview guides with predetermined questions and 1-3 answer ratings so I'm very clear on who I need to hire and my notes are the data to back them up. I like pretty much everyone when I meet them and the interview is the best you're going to get.  I never hire on the spot and typically try to have someone else I trust in the interview for additional perspective.  I always give myself time after the interview to really think through their answers.\n\nI have seen so many things go wrong when clients wait to fire too. They put it off and every single time, it ends in a dumpster fire. Property damage, reputation with vendors or customers destroyed, workmans comp injuries- I've heard/witnessed some wild stories. \n\nKeep performance notes so you can make an educated decision and have regular performance conversations with your employees so it's not a surprise. This also keeps your top employees happy because seeing poor behavior or poor performance tolerated will demotivate them right out the door.",

Raising his voice on calls is also a hard stop.  \n  \nIf they've been good in the past, you might want to reach out with the idea of getting some clarity. \"Hey, I've noticed you getting pretty agitated in meetings lately. I'm not seeing the vendor be unprofessional, so is there something else going on?\" Depending on the relationship you have with them, you might push a little on if the business is having new struggles or something in their personal life has them particularly stressed. If they respond well, great. \"Thanks for letting me know. Now, I can't have you yelling at vendors because something else is stressing you out, so please be conscientous of that, but we'll do what we can to support otherwise and try to give everyone a little extra grace right now.\" If they respond poorly, then you're firing them anyway and it just speeds up that process.",

You're churning customers as fast as you're bringing them in, which means either your product isn't sticky enough or you're targeting the wrong people.\n\nWellness products need repeat purchases to grow. If customers buy once and disappear, you don't have a business, you just have expensive one-time transactions. Our clients in wellness who broke through this plateau focused obsessively on getting customers to buy 2-3 times, not just converting new people.\n\nYour online sales dropping 30% from peak is a red flag. That's not normal fluctuation, something changed. Did you stop doing what was working? Did ad costs spike? Did a competitor launch? You need to diagnose what actually caused that drop instead of just accepting it.\n\nReleasing new products when your existing ones aren't retaining customers is just spreading yourself thinner. Fix retention on what you already have before you add complexity. Get your current customers buying more frequently or in higher amounts.\n\nThe storefront gives you an advantage most online wellness brands don't have. Use it to build real relationships with local customers who become regulars. Those people should be your core base that stabilizes revenue even when online fluctuates.\n\nFor breaking past $200k, you need either way better retention so your customer base actually grows instead of staying flat, or you need to increase average order value so the same number of customers generate more revenue. Pick one and focus there for 6 months.\n\nCheck your numbers honestly. What's your repeat purchase rate? If it's under 30%, that's your problem. What's your customer lifetime value? If people only buy once for $50, you can't profitably scale. Fix those fundamentals before you worry about growth tactics.",

Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries all up 20-30%. Pineapple, Kiwi up 15%. Gloves up 40%, Customized bowls up 50%. Even spoons up 30%, and so much other stuff. \n\nWe tried to fight it with waste control, portion control, labor control, adding higher-margin items, etc. It kinda helped at first, but eventually we decided to raise prices by $1 across the board this following Monday. However, everything keeps going up and not going to stop. \n\nThe problem is, you can‚Äôt just keep increasing prices every month. Customers can only handle so much before they start walking because fundamentally they are still getting the same check, if not less. It‚Äôs honestly insane right now. And it‚Äôs scary seeing how many restaurants are shutting down lately around us. \n\nSo I‚Äôm just wondering, what‚Äôs your current situation like? How are you guys managing to survive this mess?\n",

It could be gym at 7-8, cook a good breakfast, a walk in the park from 9-11am then a coffee date with my partner and then a trip into the city in the afternoon, then a cheap comedy show in the evening. Do two days like that and Monday comes around and you feel like you've not thought about work forever. The worst thing you can do in my opinion is spend a whole weekend doing a couple things as your brain when your painting is probably mostly on autopilot and drifts to work stuff, at least mine does all the time.

You can‚Äôt expect yourself to perform well in any business or job if your body and mind are on life support.\n\nGo for walks, take small breaks throughout the day, go to the gym, play video games, read books, eat healthy food, etc.\n\nDo what you like to do so you don‚Äôt get burnt out. Running a business is not a sprint or cramming for an exam, it‚Äôs a marathon where you need to prepare and take care of yourself first to do well. You‚Äôre in it for the long haul. \n\nIf it was easy and simple, everyone would be running a successful business.",

While our financial performance appears to be satisfactory on paper and operationally, we continue to incur a monthly loss of approximately $16,000.\n\nOur weekly sales exceed $45,000, with a gross profit margin of approximately 64% and a wage expense of 28%. However, the primary contributor to our financial challenges is the substantial amount we allocate to delivery aggregators. This month, despite a total sales of $237,000 (representing five weeks according to the retail calendar), we incurred approximately $37,000 in payments to Uber and DoorDash.\n\nDespite these substantial sales figures, we persist in operating at a loss. Given our limited capacity as a franchise, what strategies can I implement to improve our financial situation? \n\nEdit: Another problem is, I have a gym next door and we have a shared drive-way with them. The gym customers take all the parking spots, even they park on the driveway. This makes it extremely difficult for drivers to-thru customers. My google review is full with people cursing gym folks for their bad parking practices. I get only 400 cars per week in my drive-thru as opposed to 1700 in a drive-thru of another store situated in quieter road than mine. ",

Offer a small discount for direct orders (still cheaper than 28% commission).\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Delivery zone optimization\\*\\* - Are you delivering too far? Tightening your radius can cut delivery times and costs. Most customers order within 3km anyway.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Minimum order value\\*\\* - If you're not already doing this, set minimums that make the economics work. Better to lose a $15 order than subsidize it.\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Ghost kitchen model\\*\\* - Some franchises are shifting to delivery-only locations with lower overhead. Could you test a smaller, cheaper location for delivery orders only?\n\n\n\n5. \\*\\*Negotiate with aggregators\\*\\* - At your volume, you have leverage. Many will reduce commission if you commit to exclusivity or higher volume.\n\n\n\nThe real question: What's your customer acquisition cost through aggregators vs other channels? If they're bringing NEW customers who become regulars, the fee might be worth it short-term.\n\n\n\nWhat's your current split between aggregator orders vs direct orders?",

The brutal math here is that youre paying roughly 15.6% of total revenue just to delivery aggregators, which when combined with your 28% labor costs is eating up almost half your gross profit before you even touch rent, utilities, or other overhead. What most franchise owners dont realize is that you can actually negotiate better rates with these platforms once you hit certain volume thresholds, plus theres consolidation software that can help manage multiple platform orders through one system so you dont miss orders during peak times. At vGrubs we work with restaurants to aggregate all their delivery platforms into one dashboard and help optimize their delivery operations to actually turn those orders profitable instead of just break-even customer acquisition tools.\n\nThe parking situation is probably costing you way more than the delivery fees though since drive-thru customers typically have much higher profit margins than delivery orders.",

We work with tons of restaurants at Kea AI and that 15-16% you're paying to delivery platforms is just insane when you're already operating on thin margins. The math just doesn't work for most places.\n\nHere's what I've seen work for similar situations. First, you gotta start building your own direct ordering channel aggressively. Since you're on a busy roadway with good drive-thru traffic, focus on converting those customers to order direct next time. Simple stuff like receipt inserts with a discount code for direct orders, or even just training staff to mention \"next time you can skip the wait and order ahead on our app.\" The goal is getting people off those expensive platforms gradually.\n\nSecond thing is optimizing your phone orders since thats free revenue. Make sure every call gets answered professionally because missed calls during lunch rush are literally money walking away. A lot of places lose thousands just from unanswered phones when they're busy. Even something as simple as a proper phone system that queues calls instead of going to voicemail can help capture more of that direct business.\n\nThe delivery platforms aren't going anywhere but you dont have to be completely dependent on them. Start tracking what percentage of your sales come from each channel and set a goal to reduce that delivery platform percentage by even 5% over the next few months. With your volume that could save you almost $1000 monthly. Small changes add up fast when you're doing $45k+ weekly.",

      "selftext": "**Edit:** this has been a good vent session for me. Maybe I need to lurk less, post more. Venting to friends/family isn't the same. Venting to folks in my industry isn't the same.  \n  \n**Original post:** My business has solid 7 figure revenue. Profitable. Niche service/product. Little to no competition. I have tried many ways to delegate and remove myself from day to day front of the line, but it's become clear after many years of doing this and trying to delegate, that the secret sauce is me, which can't be delegated/scaled, regardless of what various business \"experts\" will claim.\n\nI guess I feel this is a bit like telling some awesome musician that they need to teach others to do what they can do so that they can take time away. Won't work. They are the secret sauce. Without them, their band/offering is not close to what it is with them.\n\nMy business sells something that is not sold and done (like a pizza, you sell it, someone eats it, and then they don't come back a year later asking for tips on how to eat their pizza). My business sells something that can literally have years of ongoing support and hand holding. The latter part is really what is sucking the soul out of me. To use the pizza example, it seems so wonderful to be able to sell something like a pizza, or a tee shirt, or a service that you complete, and then are very unlikely to hear back from a customer again unless they want to spend more money with you. It leaves space for growth, since growth doesn't essentially mean you are compounding the chance that someone comes back to you years after they purchased from you with something they need assistance with.\n\nIt is slowly but surely sucking my soul out of me to be tied to something like this. My employees are paid well. I am paid well. The business is doing fine by all financial metrics, but every single day I want to run away from it and hide. I dread the thing that used to be fun.\n\nI often envy folks who get to clock in and clock out and forget about work when they are not there. I used to have that life. I didn't like it at the time, but in hindsight, I realize how much brain-space it freed to enjoy life and hobbies outside of work. I DO enjoy the flexibility I have from running my own business, however.\n\nThe only thing really keeping me in my biz anymore is my employees and not wanting to abandon them.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, I will be fine if the business is shut down. I will find something else if needed. I live a life with very low cash requirements and have good savings. Money isn't a huge concern of mine. The main concern is mostly my employees. If I never hired employees, this would have been shut down long ago. In that sense, I regret every hiring employees when I was dumb and people told me I had to grow.\n\nI am not looking for solutions such as \"make some processes\" or \"train someone to do what you do\". I am looking for some commiserating, specifically stories of folks who may have been in a situation like me, and decided to throw in the towel in order to regain their sanity. How has it been? Do you regret it? Did you ever get back into it later?\n\nI guess I could just grab some $$ out of the business and tell my employees it is their show now and I am done paying myself so its up to them to keep the lights on? Figure it out...",

Most of the time, I find the only thing they're an expert at is extracting real money for vague promises.

But the thing is, she had never spent a day in her life actually practicing what she preached. She went right from undergrad to a doctoral program, and when she earned that, went right back into academia, as a professor. So now she's teaching business without ever having been in business.\n\nI always tell this story because to me it's such a great example of how \"knowledge authority\" works today. i.e. what looks good on paper often doesn't translate to the real world all that well. Like, who would you rather take advice from...a grungy plumber who has trouble forming complete sentences but who built an 8-figure operation from scratch?

Ironically this buddy of mine used to have 30 employees....and was always stressed out. Now he has a half a dozen and much happier because it takes less fuel to keep things running(and he is still making good money)\n\n  \nwhat's funny is while I've learned to have less stress about my own business...i probably worry too much about others...i remember a friend of mine being fired and I lost more sleep about it than he did.

          "body": "Been there, done that.\n\nI thought I was the secret sauce. My medical practice was a highly specialized niche with very little/no competition in NYC area. I dealt with a lot of complicated cases that had very poor outcomes or no solution and I was the solution. People paid a very high premium for my knowledge and skill. But problem was, it's too niche, required a lot of networking/marketing, lot of sales to explain the product/service, and none of the associate doctors could duplicate what I did, it was too much knowledge and skill for them. I taught my kids from high school, college, med school and they eventually took over my clinics. But in the meantime while I waited before they took over, here's my solution and my suggestion to you.\n\nCreate a new business that's not too niche, doesn't require too much sales or explanation what the product/service is, and easily systemizable. With my extra revenue, I bought real estate. I created systems to purchase, renovate, and manage the properties. I went into other businesses that are recession resistant, and also some franchises. That's what saved my sanity.",

It was potentially scalable beyond us, we had plans to open multiple locations. \nAfter my 2nd baby, I completely burned out and over the following year of health issues with my youngest, I transitioned everything to my partner and walked away. I don't regret it and now years later I'm building again but in a completely different way that gives me freedom. \nI loved my clients and still miss them but it has been so healing not to live with that stress anymore. I appreciate so much more of the true luxuries in life like slowness and spontaneity, and my time with my kids.",

Not walking away, more gently placing it in another situation so it can grow far beyond what I care to do. But I will take some time to work next to them and then it's up to them to keep it going. It is also niche but with a steady market, and they already do similar things so it's a good fit. Do you have a competitor or colleague you could approach with that idea?",
