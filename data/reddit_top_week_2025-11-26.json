      "selftext": "I am about 25k in debt and it feels really heavy right now. If I could just make a bit more than 20 dollars a day for a few years, I could slowly dig myself out. The problem is I do not have the time or energy for a second full time job.\n\nI am not great at big business ideas. The only thing I can imagine is something small online, like selling a few simple products or a tiny ecommerce page. A friend told me I should not overthink it and just put up a very simple site first, using one of those one sentence website tools like genstore to get the basic store in place, then slowly fix the text and layout later. It sounds nice in theory, but I am not sure if I am just running away from learning real skills.\n\nIf you only had one or two hours a day and a goal like “just make 20 extra dollars,” would you spend that time learning more skills, or would you push out a tiny store as fast as possible and see what happens I would really like to hear from people who used a very small side project to pay off debt or at least make it less scary.",

You basically post yourself as being available for odd jobs. Could be anything from cleaning, organizing, yard work, etc.  Any odd job around the house you can think of you can find someone on Task Rabbit to do. You set your price and you work with the client to set specific day and time so you can work around your schedule to some degree.",

I try to join better paid survey panels and treat the rest as pocket money, the key is to do them regularly. Sometimes I also use sites like Clickworker to take small tasks, usually around five to six dollars each.\n\nAnother part is Fiverr. I take orders there for website and app testing and give user feedback. This does need some basic skills and you also have to spend time building your profile and reviews, so the beginning is slow.\n\nI also do some niche reselling. I look for small rare items that some people still want, like merch from certain communities or old devices that are no longer made. I buy them cheap, clean them up and resell them. This part depends a lot on information gaps.\n\nThe newest part is using AI to make commercial videos for clients. I write a full script at home first, then use the commercial video templates in MovieFlow to create an AI version of the video. After that I bring it into an editor to fix the pacing, visuals and subtitles, then send the final video to the client for their website or social media. The pay for this is usually higher than normal small tasks.\n\nAll of these can be done from home and do not need a huge upfront cost. I am curious what legal at home side hustles are the most stable or most worth recommending for you. Is there anything you feel a normal person could start without a big risk or huge budget",

That's going to be hard if you don't have a support system outside of your home, but you have to expect that there will be attempts to sabotage anything you're doing to improve yourself and remove the amount of control they have over your life right now. Do what you can to find some real friends in your area to connect with. Start slowly leaving the house more often. Have a friend teach you how to drive until you can get your license, without telling your family. I'm assuming they wouldn't let you borrow their car to use on your driving test. Idk if there are driving schools in your area that can help with that or if a friend will let you use theirs. Where I live you have to provide a car to drive for the road test when getting your license.\n\nPeople don't understand that if you don't have money, can't drive legally, and don't have a support system, it's not as easy as just leaving. Leave and go where? Any skills you start learning, keep it to yourself as much as possible. Any money you start saving up, keep it a secret. If your family is using you as their free caregiver and servant, you have to expect that upsetting the status quo is going to upset them and that they'll do their best to stop it. When I was 19, I had to move out of state before I could get control over my life and money finally. It got to the point where my parents started using the money I made at my job and set aside for my tuition and savings towards moving out for fun gifts for themselves. There's a huge difference between being ungrateful and being in a highly controlling and abusive home where your parents aren't allowing you to lead an independent life or learn the skills you need in order to do that. Good luck to you.",

I’d always be saying things like “sorry for getting back to you on weekend” but once I started actually listening to my customers, I learned that they loved this because it meant I was available when they were available … and they were willing to pay MORE for that convenience!  Even more important, the company was mission-driven so I could also talk to customers about mission while I was under their sink (a bit of a weird visual)\n\nThe company ended up launching nationwide on Shark Tank a couple years later and got acquired, but it was the lessons learned from the gritty night/weekend days that built the foundation!\n\nCheering for everyone in this group!

And most cars parked in the driveway had the cleanest headlights I've ever seen. And truthfully, my results have always been a bit of a mixed bag.\n\nSo I'm looking for another side hustle I can do where customer acquisition is very easy. I don't mind if a service is cheap like $10-30 per service if there are plentiful customers. I wanna know that if I go door to door almost everyone is a potential customer. I wanna be able to start tomorrow and have made back the investment by the end of the day almost guaranteed.\n\nLastly, I only have $50-$100 to invest in this.

      "selftext": "This is a continuation of one of my posts from about 5 months ago which began like this: \n\n\"So I began looking for ways to earn extra income during my long breaks at work. Here's the journey so far:\n\n1. Online Surveys – I made a few dollars, but quickly realized it wasn’t worth the time or effort.\n2. Bank Churning – I learned how to take advantage of sign-up bonuses and made a few thousand dollars. However, it wasn’t sustainable since offers can take over a year to become available again.\n3. Social Casinos – I discovered sweepstakes-based casino sites and started logging into 20+ of them daily, mostly playing blackjack. This earned me around $500/month.\n4. AMOE (Mail-In Entries) – I learned that I could send physical envelopes to social casinos to receive free Sweeps Coins. I created a system to streamline the writing process. I made around $10,000 in the first year and have made about $14,000 so far this year.\n5. Researched Amazon Dropshipping, retail arbitrage, FBA/FBM. Looked into creating my own products to sell. Created an Amazon merchant account. Bought shipping supplies. In the end, things didn't pan out.\n6. AI Content Creation – I learned how to generate AI models using Stable Diffusion, including NSFW images and videos through platforms like Civitai. I launched an Instagram page featuring sexy AI models and paid $25 to gain \\~700 followers (mostly fake or inactive). I also started a Fanvue page for NSFW content. I got 1 subscriber at $9.99/month, but they canceled within the first month. Since then, my follower count has dropped to around 530, and I currently have no subscribers.\n7. Niche Instagram Account – About a week ago, I created a new Instagram page focused on a specific niche I saw performing well. The first few days were slow with zero views, but then one video went semi-viral, which boosted the rest of my content. In the past 8 days, I’ve grown from 0 to over 1,200 followers, gaining 100+ per day. My current view range is 6k (yesterday's post) – 129k (semi-viral video from about 5 days ago).\n\nNext Steps\n\n8. Fanvue (Round 2) – I plan to launch a second Fanvue page with NSFW content once this new Instagram account hits 10,000 followers (hopefully within a month). I'm also researching Instagram monetization options based on view count.\n\n9. TikTok Expansion – I’ll be repurposing my content for TikTok and exploring monetization through the Creator Fund or other methods.\n\n10. YouTube Strategy – I plan to expand to YouTube. While YouTube Shorts don’t pay much even with high views, I’m considering ways to transition into longer-form content that can generate ad revenue and improve profitability.\n\nI feel extremely lucky to have succeeded with my 2nd Instagram account so quickly while others have struggled, including me. The point is to not give up, research, learn new tools, figure out what works, what doesn't, and try again.\n\nThanks for reading.\"\n\nSo that was 5+ months ago. Where am I now?\n\n1. My biggest and best money-maker (made \\~$30k?), social casinos, are being banned in many states, including mine, so now the process of using pen plotters to automate the writing process is useless. (Now, don't ask me how I'm doing this unless you're willing to pay me or buy 1 or more of my pen plotters which are collecting dust. I paid about $400/plotter, I have 4. I'll sell for $200)\n\n2. I had 2 instagram accounts, one focused on sexy asians in skimpy bikinis while the other was more western-girls focused. The niche Instagram account I mentioned earlier is focused on muscly girls in skimpy bikinis. The asian girl account wasn't performing well so I decided to close that account and combine asians and all other girls into my main niche account. The viral video I mentioned before is now at 2.1 million views. I have about 19k followers on my Instagram account, about 3k on my Tiktok account, and 4 followers on my new Facebook account. All this in about 5 months.\n\nMAKING MONEY ON SOCIAL MEDIA \n\nI think at about 5k followers on Instagram, the subscriber feature becomes available which allows followers to subscribe for exclusive content. I charge 4.99 and have 30 subscribers. Only 8 of them are paying and the rest are on a free 7 day trial so the numbers fluctuate.\n\nHowever, my plan was to redirect traffic with links to adult sites and charge a subscription. I ran into trouble with Fanvue after they decided my AI girls looked too young and banned me and threated legal action if I made a new account...great. Then I created an account on Fansly and gained some subscribers there but got banned again because apparently all models, whether real or AI, need real identification. I didn't give up and looked for others. Patreon? No realistic porn allowed. I settled on Dfans where I now reside. \n\nI wasn't sure how to advertise my Dfans on Instagram besides posting the link in my bio. Oh, I realized you're not allowed to directly link an adult site from instagram so I used a site called beacons(dot)ai which is safe for Instagram and allows me to link other sites. I use it for Tiktok as well. On Instagram, I mention my beacons link often in my videos, either through the description or on texts overlayed on videos. I've been aggressively promoting my Beacons (Dfans) link for about a month now. I sit at 17 subscribers on Dfans @ 9.99/subscriber. Dfans takes 20%. I'm disappointed that I only have 17 subs with nearly 19k followers on Instagram and 3k on Tiktok. ChatGPT said that 1% of followers subscribing is reasonable. So I should have at least 190 subs = $1,900/month before Dfans takes 20%. Tiktok is horrible for my type of content because 90% of my bikini girl videos either gets removed or restricted for content violations. I appeal and get most of my videos restored but I racked up a couple of strikes and am in danger of being banned on the platform. \n\nI also posted my content on Youtube Shorts and within a month or two, my channel got banned for whatever reason.\n\nI'm now posting on Facebook and within a month I have like 4 followers. Be patient.\n\nI uploaded some NSFW content on my other account and a Redditor messaged me asking for custom content. I made like $600 in a month from him. \n\nAnother redditor asked me to create ads for them after I uploaded a short film. \n\nLEVERAGING AI SKILLS\n\nNow that I'm pretty skilled with AI image/video generation. I decided to create a Youtube channel focused on study/relaxing music with cinematic AI videos. I repurposed my dormant Youtube channel from like 15+ years ago which had 2.8k subscribers. I barely have any views but I'm hoping to upload a 1-2 hour video every 1-2 weeks so hopefully the algorithm will notice me.\n\nEtsy. I decided to open an Etsy store with my AI art. I picked a niche and went for it. I knew I wanted to create different kinds of artwork so I chose a generic name for my shop. I used artwork from a book that was popular when I was young and colorized it for Halloween. So far, I made about $150 in about 1.5 months. ChatGPT helped with SEO when naming products, tagging, and description. Copywritten work? Yes, but others on Etsy were selling it so I said, what the hell, I'll take it down if they tell me.\n\nI have a subscription to Suno for music, ComfyUI for NSFW image/video gen, OpenArt for my AI image/video generations, Midjourney for inspiration and image gen, and ChatGPT for prompting and ideas.\n\nWhat now?\n\nKeep improving and being persistent. Persistence and consistency is key. I could have given up many times along the way but I'm stubborn and want to succeed. I used to play a lot of video games and now I treat this as a real life game that has real world benefits. I invest money into the tools that are going to help me succeed and work hard for the payout.\n\nWhy are you giving away your secrets?\n\nI don't know if it's a secret but this path is a difficult one. I'm documenting this here because I want to know how far I've come in another 5+ months. Another reason is because I know that 99.9% of the people that read this don't have it in them to hustle and grind. I realized this when I was writing my social casino postcards. I told people around me to do it because it's free money but 0% did it because it required work.\n\nTo the .1%, keep grinding.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "selftext": "I've been in affiliate marketing since 2016. Made a ton with the webinar platform and web hosting affiliates during Covid. Made a ton with Hims/BetterHelp around the same time. Both through blog and social media affiliate marketing. Here's the ones I'm bullish on for 2026 and why. Also, I am not affiliated with any of them because I'm now out of the game (still make a few thousand a month) running a 7 figure social agency, but still find this stuff super interesting:\n-Booking.com: Seriously. Reason being: big % payout AND it's applicable to anyone. Easy approval too. You can see how this could work -- next time your friend is booking a vacation, just send them your link. Hand-to-hand combat like this can yield pretty decent payouts. \n-Otterly AI: Any of the LLM visibility tools are great as affiliate partners today. Every company wants to see how they appear in ChatGPT for generative engine optimization. The tools are new, conversion rates are relatively high, and ATV is really, really high (~$10k+ per year). Ranking for the search terms in Google is still possible because it's an emerging space. \n-Vista Social: I'm very bullish on channel/affiliate program alignment. This is what I mean: if you have a big presence on social (say Instagram), it's easy to promote tools that operate for that channel. That makes tools like Vista Social powerful affiliates. Highest conversion window in that space + 20% recurring commission. \n-Canva: Same deal. Very good channel/affiliate alignment. If you're on any visual channel with clout -- Insta, TikTok, Pinterest, etc. You can sell Canva -- it's universal to those users. \n-Sofi: So many use cases, 4-figure bounties on some products. No rule against retargeting ads, which can work quite well. \n-ChartPrime: Easy sell with many use cases. 30% commission and an AOV over $400. \n\nWhat others?",

Job boards can be full of ghost listings and recruiter spam, so be picky. I’ve had better luck with smaller email lists, wfhalert sends verified remote jobs by email and I’ve seen legit entry level stuff there. Pair that with one local gig like weekend house sitting or flipping a few items on Facebook Marketplace and you can usually hit $200 to $300 pretty consistently.",

      "selftext": " I really think the real opportunity is not “new AI models” but clear systems. Most people do not want a single magic prompt. They want a working AI workflow, step by step instructions and ready to use prompt packs that save time and help them make money. Most users are not experts. They get stuck because they do not know what to type or they waste hours tweaking prompts and still do not get stable results. If you can build something that works and explain it in plain language, that is already a product.\n\nI have been testing this with small digital products. One example is an image prompt guide for Etsy sellers, where I break down how to describe style, batch create images and write listings, then sell it as a short guide plus prompt pack. Another is a workflow for commercial videos. I teach how to write the product script, then show how to plug it into MovieFlow with a commercial template to get a full AI video draft, and finally do light edits in a normal editor. In both cases the value is the workflow itself, not just a list of prompts.\n\nThere is no ready template for this. You build from zero, run many tests, and then clean everything up into something other people can follow. That part takes time, but once it is done the product turns into a long term asset that can keep selling in the background. As someone selling digital products I am still surprised how many people want this kind of thing and have no idea where to start. Demand for good workflows is much bigger than the number of people willing to sit down and really build them.",

      "selftext": "Major info from my last post first- (Posted 2 months ago)\n\n—-\n\nSo I got to know I have a severe heart condition in January that needed an urgent procedure to happen in order for me to live. I got it done, lots of paranoia and a long recovery made me try out a few major online side hustles as I took a long break from my job. Here’s what worked for me and can work for you too!\n\nActual Book Publishing (Amazon KDP)-  So writing has been my passion since a long time and I had this fairytale story written from like the past 2 years, so I gave it a try and published it with a nice cover and a little self done social media marketing it cost me $500 total to format it, cover artists and some social media posts. It’s earning 100$/month since! I have another book planned but won’t publish it until next year.\n\nNext was Ebooks, simply taking a burning issue or a very niche idea and creating a how to guide (purely Chatgpt) but NOT AI SLOP! Something that has value and people use it. I made 2 books and felt it was a bit boring for me, it costed me 100$/book and I made like 20$ from each till now. This literally has a huge potential if done properly and genuinely you can make 10-15 books a month, even if 1 blows up you are set for life!\n\nFacebook Pages- So a little background, in the place I worked I used to manage a lot of pages like this (this was pre facebook monetisation era) but as FB started monetising content even pictures and text posts, It became a full blown business! As I was off from work I focused on one page of my own and grew it to almost 100k followers in 6 months (it had 10k in Jan)\n\nThis page earns me almost $1000, every month since March and it’s only increasing. The only thing I do is make 5 posts a day, literal photos and maybe some graphics like quote posters every once in a while.\n\nYouTube - This has been my favourite! So there’s a very good niche of explainer videos that you must have seen! It’s just simply explaining stuff that’s interesting. It maybe sports, Entertainment, movies, science, money anything! I myself preferred motorsports so I went with that! This month is my 3rd month being monetised and I earned around $3000 till today (I started in July End, monetised in Sep 1st Week) This thing helped me find potential people who wanted to do the same thing and as I recruited a lot of video editors for myself I asked them to work with me with a few bucks overcharge (If I pay 50 for a 15 min video I ask $60) and this helped me earn a $200 from my first client.\n\nSo yeah! That’s pretty much it, I will be uploading proofs in comments if People want, I just wanted to post this and let people know that there is always light at the end of the tunnel and if you are willing to work and maybe spend a little money, the universe has a great way of returning it in multiple folds!\n\nNow Update- (I have helped 3 people who are doing Facebook, 2 are doing Youtube with me) Now the monthly earnings are increasing to almost $3k in profits (1k from facebook, $2k from YouTube, around $100 from books)\n\nAlso, I am walking regularly now… little steps… I know but We will get there soon! \n\nSo ama I guess, I will try to help out as many people as I can, just like last time :)",

          "body": "A decent side hustle I've been doing is looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than any initial cost. It's a form of arbitrage, and it can make you an extra couple hundred each month. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives those offers higher, creating more opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how it works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

If better pics could help them catch even *some* of those lost customers, maybe they'd pay for that.\n\nBefore you call it a “shitty idea,” remember this: restaurant owners who’ve run their business for years don’t buy anything that would mislead their customers. They bought because the quality matched what they actually serve.\n\nMy goal wasn’t to make cheap-looking AI pics. I recreated the dish exactly how it’s served, just styled and lit properly, like it would be in a pro studio shoot.\n\nSo I made a list of places with awful-looking menus.  \nThen I used ChatGPT’s image tool to generate nicer versions—pro-style, appetizing, clean backgrounds. No camera. No food. Just AI prompts.\n\nI emailed each business with two free sample images based on their menu.  \nSuper simple message. No pitch. Just:  \n“Hey, I tried reimagining your dishes like this.”\n\nSome ignored it.  \nSome replied.  \nAnd a few asked for a full set of menu pics.\n\nI wasn’t charging much - around €150 per client, but after a while I was making around €1K/month, just working with businesses in my area.\n\nZero experience. No portfolio. Just an idea, free tools, and a bit of time.\n\nIf you’re broke or starting from scratch, this might be worth trying. It’s super easy to do and doesn’t take much time at all.",

I recreated the dish exactly how it’s served, just styled and lit properly\n\nHow many money did it cost to you doing this basically? You went trough all the tables asking the other clients \"oh really nice choice you made, lemme took a photo for a side gig\"?\n\nIt would be cool if you could just answer these questions because i could be interested in this type of cashgrabbing, respectfully.

You are deciving people into thinking the food they order is what they see and its not. And also, the way you worded it, it seems like the business dont know you are using AI. People dont pay only for a result, but for the process and work too.

          "body": "I've been making a couple hundred each month just by looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than the cost. It's called bonus arbitrage. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

Most people think dropshipping means Shopify, ads, and spending money, but eBay already has built-in traffic. With tools like AutoDS the process is mostly automated. It’s beginner friendly and doesn’t require big upfront costs.\n\nAnother underrated one is doing **s**hort marketing videos for small businesses. Every business needs content for Instagram and TikTok, but most don’t know how to make it or don’t have time. You can create these videos using stock footage, simple templates, and AI voice tools. The hardest part used to be the voiceover, but that is solved easily now with modern tools. A few local clients paying for monthly content bundles can become steady income.\n\nBoth of these are quiet, low competition, and way more profitable than the apps and trends people usually recommend.\n\nI write about all these methods in my blog post.

Been messing around with lots and lots of programs but finally narrowed down to 3 that converted the best for me. Here is the breakdown\n\nJobOwl around $3,5k per month - they offer 40% recurring revenue per user. It's not a huge amount per user because the subscription is $15 BUT it's so laughably easy to promote I'm guessing because of how the job market is now. that it's my most successful pick. It's software that tailors resume to job descriptions. I promote it on Facebook groups, resume hack tiktoks, some on reddit\n\nUseArticle around 2,2k per month - 50% commission. I promote on TikTok, content around productivity and side hustles. Reddit worked too. Great program because the commission is bigger then JobOwl but it doesn't convert as well\n\nSemRush around 2,3k per month - high price so very high commission and people stay for long I noticed. It's a seo tool. Downside is that pretty much already most people use it. I've been doing TikTok seo tips and tricks and have been slipping things in like \"here is the way I pick keywords, I go to SemRush (if you don't have an account, link in bio)\" that's basically my strategy for all of them. Content has to be useful and affiliate link is just something that's slipped in in a \"oh by the way, check X for Y\" \n\nI'll be sticking with just those 3 for a while since I'm spreading myself a bit too thin already. Curious what programs do other affiliates use?",

You can dump a plain doc in there, hit publish, and boom it looks like an actual product instead of a sad Google Drive file. The page flip thing makes people take it more seriously too, and being able to track opens is super helpful for figuring out if the interest is real or just “oh neat” clicks.\n\nThe email capture part is tricky though.

          "body": "I've been making a couple hundred each month just by looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than the cost. It's called bonus arbitrage. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

      "selftext": "Lately I have been reading this sub a lot and watching people around me. A few people I know say they make around 20k a month using AI to create influencer style photos and short videos. It is not just posting random AI art any more. They build a full AI influencer brand around one character and keep a steady flow of posts across platforms.\n\nWhat I see now is that AI is turning into a way to produce content at scale. For images people keep talking about tools like Modelsify, Midjourney and Lumalabs to lock in the look and style. For video some people write a real script first, then use something like MovieFlow to turn that script into a longer story video, and later cut it into vertical shorts for each platform. It feels more like a small content studio than a one off AI experiment.\n\nI am still just watching and learning, nowhere near that income level, but the demand seems real. As a viewer you are following a character and an ongoing story, not just random posts. As a creator, once the character and accounts are set up, the work is more about keeping a pace and posting rhythm, which starts to look a bit like semi passive income. I am not greedy. If I could make an extra 200 dollars a month from something like this I would already be happy.\n\nSo I wanted to ask people here who are actually doing this. When you use AI for content as a side project, how do you build the image pipeline and keep the video look stable over time Are there tool combinations you trust for long term work For example where do you still rely on classic editing and where do you let a long form AI video tool like MovieFlow handle the first version And in real life, how passive does it feel once the system is running",

But any legitimate questions get zero responses. \n\nI’m NOT doing this ATM, but considering diving into it.  I’d say let the AI do as much work as possible. The editing is what’s going to take the most amount of time.  \n\nAs far as passive vs active, it’s going to be all active until you have a lot of flowers and all those $10-75/month posts bring more views and more income.  So you have close to 100 of $10-75 revenue stream equivalent to $1000-7500/ month.  All speculation though.  ",

Just the technology gets better. \n\nFor example: desktop publishing - there was a time, not long ago, you had to drive to a store and pay someone to print something for you. Then the personal computer and desktop printer was invented. People started printing at home. \n\nAnimators use to have to draw by hand on paper, with teams of people and special technology that cost tons of money. Now you can animate on a laptop. \n\nShooting a movie use to be on film, there was no digital.  It cost tons of money, and production teams were needed. Now anyone can shoot a movie on an iPhone and laptop. \n\nThe process of creating good content in the same, the script must be amazing, and the basic steps are the same. But the technology continues to improve, get faster, easier to use and access, cheaper to produce, etc…\n\nIf Ai pans out, we will be saying, “We use to have to go out and hire an actor, get insurance, and pay tons of money to get this shot of Tom C (who’s now dead) jumping out of this boat at high speed - now we just prompt this laptop.”",

Think niche affiliate blogs, micro digital products like templates, guides, or low-maintenance SaaS automations.

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche and you can build it up over time.\n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/is-the-wealthy-affiliate-black-friday-deal-worth-it-heres-whats-included-november-28-december-1/",

Online sportsbooks spend a ridiculous amount on new-user acquisition, and the promos they give out are often worth more than the tiny hit you take converting them.

Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives those offers higher, creating more opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how it works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them.

You would have a lot of control over what you design and who you sell it to. Like u/Samade20 mentioned, dropshipping can be quite viable if you design products that people actually want. Don't be afraid to share with friends and family.\n\nAlso, AI gets a lot of bad rap, and I don't think AI is necessarily a full replacement of human ingenuity, but consulting an AI for ideas and feedback and using it for rapid iteration can be a very viable way to design digital products if you don't know where to start.\n\nBest of luck, and stay consistent my friend :)",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/is-the-wealthy-affiliate-black-friday-deal-worth-it-heres-whats-included-november-28-december-1/",

You need a steady loop of users, updates, and a monetization plan like ads, cosmetic IAPs, or subscriptions, and even then most games don’t break out. Try a tiny prototype first, ship it fast, and see if anyone comes back in a week, then iterate. For a more stable income while you learn, I sometimes watch for remote roles in support or admin, wfhalert emails verified remote jobs and it’s been a low noise way to find legit work between projects.",

          "body": "Reselling. It takes research and work, but find a niche or deals that you can sell on eBay. It’s all about finding a part of the market that’s in demand but eBay sellers aren’t honed in on.\n\nOr you can do research to see what sellers are selling the most of and try to compete with them. The secret that no one gets is that convenience is a very big part of this business. There are many people out there who don’t care about finding the best deals out of 20 different websites. They will use Amazon and eBay and that’s it. So find something outside of those two sites  that isn’t being sold much on eBay and list them. I had a thought about using wholesale stores to sell things like pet food in larger quantities than other stores provide. Toilet paper, etc. That’s dropship reselling. When you list an item and it gets bought on eBay, you order it from Costco, or Walmart (or whatever) and ship it to their house. Provide the tracking numbers on eBay and then you get paid after a grace period. Don’t start with big items because eBay will hold the payout on the first few orders you get until they are delivered and eBay ensures you’re not scamming people. Then once you sell about 10-15 items and they are successfully delivered, then eBay will be more forthcoming with the payouts. You get up to 200 listings before eBay will charge you for listing items. \n\nI plan on starting this kind of side-hustle very soon so if I remember I will check back in after a month with progress report.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/is-the-wealthy-affiliate-black-friday-deal-worth-it-heres-whats-included-november-28-december-1/",

Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them.

          "body": "You can try bonus arbitrage, which can probably make you a couple hundred each month. Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

          "body": "You can try bonus arbitrage, which can probably make you a couple hundred each month. Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

          "body": "You can start a simple dropshipping store. You do not need inventory. You post products on a platform like eBay, and when someone buys, a supplier ships it for you. Tools like AutoDS automate most of the work, so this fits well with school and your schedule. Your car isn’t needed for this one, and 1k is more than enough to start.\n\nAnother path is building a faceless YouTube channel. You never have to show your face. You can use stock footage, simple editing, and AI voiceover tools. The voiceover used to be the hardest part, but AI solves that easily. Once a few videos start getting views, a channel can earn from ads and affiliate links for months or years. With Miami as your environment, you can even make local niche content if you want.\n\nYou can also make short marketing videos for small businesses. Restaurants, barbershops, gyms, car detailers, landscape services, even small online brands all need short videos for TikTok and Instagram. You can make these from home using stock clips and AI voice tools. Go in person and offer a small content bundle. Your car makes this easier because you can visit businesses and build relationships.\n\nThese are all things that can grow, pay more over time, and give you real skills instead of doing random low paying gigs.\n\nI cover all these methods in my blog.

I live in Ontario, Canada, and I’ve been trying to find a legit online/remote job for a while now. One of the biggest barriers I keep running into is that a lot of Canadian remote positions want bilingual English/French speakers — and I only speak English.\n\nMy situation is a bit urgent. I have MS, and my mobility isn’t great, so remote work is really the only realistic option for me right now. I’ve been waiting a long time for ODSP, and I need to find something soon just to stay afloat.\n\nIf anyone here has tips on:\n• Where to apply for English-only remote jobs\n• Companies that hire Canadians for fully remote work\n• Sites or communities that are actually legit (not scams)\n• Roles that don’t require a ton of physical activity or being on the phone all day\n• Any personal experiences with finding remote work in Ontario\n\n…I would be super grateful.\n\nI have customer service, admin, and leadership experience — I just need to find a chance somewhere.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to help.

So, Upwork itself is legit, they are not scamming you in any way, and all of their fees are well documented and laid out in their terms which you agree to when you make an account. But, yeah, at the same time, it's absolutely swarming with both scammers posing to hire and scammers posing to offer work, so both sides.\n\nThe reasoning there is scammers prey on desperation, since your ability to reason and think logically is diminished as you succumb to desperation. And that's on both sides, folks desperately looking for cheap labor since they can't afford professional services and need to get work done, as well as folks desperately looking for work, like yourself. A vast marketplace rife with desperation is always going to be a huge target for scammers. And that's also the logic behind it being pay-to-play, since scammers generally just want to scam you in order to get money without shelling out even so much as a penny in the process. So, being pay-to-play reduces the effectiveness of many scammers, but it doesn't actually eliminate the problem.",

It’s annoying, especially when you’re brand new and not even guaranteed to land a job yet.\n\nThe platform is real, but the early stage feels like you’re burning money just to try to earn money.\n\nIf you’re still exploring online options, you might want to pair Upwork with something that doesn’t cost anything upfront. I’ve been messing with DropWork + ClubChain recently (their full launch is in January), and they’re running free tasks on Zealy right now no subscription, no bidding, just small quests you do on your own time. They even added a 1,000 USDT mini-game, so at least you can earn something while figuring out Upwork.\n\nSo yeah, Upwork is legit, but it’s expensive at the beginning.

      "selftext": "Last month I started a case study to see how much revenue I could drive from posting on Reddit. It just ended yesterday (30 days) and these were the results.\n\n**Conversions:** 100+\n\n**Revenue:** $4K+\n\n**Time required:** 15-20 minutes\n\n# What I did\n\nI wrote a post and published it in a subreddit where the target audience I wanted to reach, hung out.\n\n* I did keyword research to write the post around keywords that could rank in Google\n* I aimed for low-competition, high-volume keywords\n* I made the post short-form (so it was under 500 words)\n\n# Takeaway\n\nMy goal was to be super helpful and solve a problem inside the post. So, I wrote about the pain points, my audience had, gave a partial solution that they could get relief with then linked to the full solution.\n\nIt converted to sales.\n\nThe post didn't even go viral. It got around 20K views or so in the past month. This is from one post only.\n\nThat's it.\n\nI plan on trying it again, maybe targeting a different niche to see if I get different or better results.\n\nI think the key takeaway is that Reddit marketing can be done successfully. I love Reddit for how raw and real conversations here are.\n\nI don't want to water that down with marketing but, companies are already doing it. I think if you can balance helpful, value-packed content with driving business to your brand or offer, it can be a win-win.\n\n**What do you think?**\n\n**Have you tried this?**",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone.  \nI am not much of a Redditor, but I'm struggling now and decided to ask/share here to get tome thoughts and insights, maybe.\n\nA few months ago, I lost my job and just then talking to my friend I learnt the details of her work which is link building. I did some reading and found the concept of SEO very intriguing, as it is basically you trying to figure out the rules by which Google plays and then succeed at the game (at least how I see it so far). The organic aspect of it seems very interesting to me.\n\nI must say I am from a small country where SEO is not very developed, but we have some local SEO agencies and companies that have SEO departments, both of which accept interns regularly. So I decided to give it my time and attention and learn at least the basics and try to get into the field.\n\nThe basics of SEO were pretty easy to understand. My friend introduced me to everything (big thanks to her!) and I even started helping her (unofficially) with her job a bit to get some hands-on experience in email outreach. We managed to build something around 10 links in a month with my help, and I am very proud of that, honestly.\n\nRecently I have also completed a fill SEO course which was very easy to follow and understand. It felt somewhat reassuring, seeing stuff I already knew from what my friend had taught me included in the course. I am now waiting to see the results of my final exam on it.\n\nStarting from the last week, I have also been accepted for an internship. They gave the applicants an initial task, and apparently I did it well enough that I passed. Now, this is an internship for a link building position, and we're starting from the basics, but I can't wait to start doing more practical work.\n\nAll of this being said, I want to share that even though I have been saying that stuff feels easy to understand, it also feels very overwhelming. Every single little thing/term/tactic seems to lead to a bunch more new and complex to remember things. Having no real work experience, it is very hard for me to make sense of what is actually a commonplace thing to do and what is very situational and possibly even outdated.\n\nI try my best to listen to beginner-friendly podcasts and whatnot to get some sense of trust in my own knowledge and understanding of things. Most of the time, having no paid tools to use or having no actual work experience/environment with the theory/practice ratio being something like 90/10 it feels so overwhelming and too much at times to grasp.\n\nI would love to hear how you all started your journeys. Is it okay to feel this way? Am I overthinking it, and once/if I get a proper job in the field it will get easier with more experience? I think there are a lot of us newcomers here, and I would love to hear from you too. Do you have similar stuff going on for you? How do you go about it?",

I went down a pretty big rabbit hole reading Reddit threads, founders’ stories, complaints, success posts, everything I could find. The same pain points kept popping up over and over—on both sides.\n\nFrom the **merchant side**, I kept seeing things like:  \n• “Hard to know which affiliates actually drive incremental revenue.”  \n• “Coupon sites vacuum up commissions on sales we would’ve gotten anyway.”  \n• “Tracking breaks constantly or needs tons of dev work.”  \n• “Refunds and cancellations are a nightmare to reconcile.”  \n• “Fraud and low-quality affiliates make the whole thing feel sketchy.”\n\nFrom the **affiliate side**, it was stuff like:  \n• “Opaque tracking… feels like I’m guessing half the time.”  \n• “Platforms don’t keep creators updated on deals or new offers.”  \n• “Most tools are made for big creators, not smaller ones.”  \n• “Delayed payouts or unclear earnings.”  \n• “Zero support… just drive traffic and hope for the best.”\n\nAfter reading all this, I started wondering:  \n**What would a super simple, drop-in affiliate system look like if it was built in 2025 from scratch?**\n\nSomething like:\n\n* One script added to the site\n* Auto-tracking of clicks + purchases\n* Clear attribution\n* Dead simple dashboard\n* AI-powered fraud detection and refund reconciliation\n* Tools that help creators actually convert, not just blast links\n\nNo huge setup, no custom backend, no clunky legacy stuff.\n\nRight now, I’ve only built a small landing page and waitlist form just to see if there’s real interest before I invest months into this. Absolutely nothing is live and I have no product to sell. Just trying to validate the idea.\n\n**Here’s the prototype landing page if anyone wants to take a look or join the waitlist:**  \n[https://affiliate-platform-e0416.web.app/](https://affiliate-platform-e0416.web.app/)\n\n(I only include this because some subs require you to show what you’re working on. If the link isn’t allowed, mods can remove it, no hard feelings.)\n\nMy actual question for this sub:  \n**If you’re a merchant, creator, or anyone who deals with affiliate programs, would a drop-in system like this actually solve anything for you?**  \nOr are the real problems somewhere else entirely?\n\nHappy to take criticism, suggestions, or “dude don’t build this” feedback too. The whole point is figuring out if this is useful before writing real code.",

It was stressing him out and slowing him down. \n\n\n\nSo I decided to build him an chatbot. Nothing fancy  just something that could actually help him. And, it ended up working way better than I expected. It helped answer customer’s questions and provide recommendations for the menu considering the menu is pretty large. \n\n\n\nAfter doing this, here are the biggest things I learned:\n\n\n\n1. Have confidence in your skills.\n\n\n\nI didn’t even know if I could build a good chatbot until I actually tried it. Sometimes you don’t know you can do something until you actually try.\n\n\n\n2. Know the value you create.\n\n\n\nI realized the bot wasn’t just “answering questions.” It was giving my dad time back. Every minute the bot handled a question was a minute he didn’t have to leave the oven or stop prepping orders. Time saved is value.\n\n\n\n3. Think long term, not one-time.\n\n\n\nInstead of thinking, “let me just build this once,” I realized how useful it would be to refine it over time, improving responses, adding new features, updating menu items, logging common questions, etc. \n\n  \n\n\n4. Learn from others\n\n\n\nMaking a chatbot that actually works is hard. I watched tutorials, learned from devs, etc. That saved me from so much time. There’s always someone who already solved the problem you’re facing.\n\n\n\nYou can build a lot of useful things with agents and chatbots, even for small businesses like my dad’s.\n\n",

They operate with almost no visibility in the tech world, yet they’ve become one of Elon Musk’s biggest financial backers.\n\nWhat shocked me first was how small they are.\n\nVy runs with only four core investors and roughly twenty people across California, London and Dubai. Even with a team that small, they **manage around fifteen billion dollars and have delivered about twenty-eight per cent annual returns for ten years.**\n\nThe second surprising thing is how concentrated they are. Instead of spraying money across dozens of startups, they built their entire identity around backing Musk early and sticking with him for the long haul.\n\nSome of their biggest moves include:\n\n* Investing in SpaceX when it was valued at $15B (it’s now close to $400B)\n* Putting $700M into the Twitter acquisition\n* Taking large positions in Neuralink and xAI\n\nThere are estimates that more than half of Vy’s portfolio is now tied to companies Musk runs.\n\nThe final thing that stood out is how they think about building a firm. They aren’t trying to scale into a giant institution. They actually told their LPs recently that they won’t raise outside money anymore. After compounding billions, they want to invest their own capital instead, which is extremely rare in venture.\n\nAnd they’re not only focused on the US. They backed companies like Zomato and Urban Company in India, along with firms like Upgrade, Cerebras and Coalition.\n\nWhen you put it all together, Vy feels less like a traditional VC fund and more like a tight, high-trust investment group built around long-term conviction instead of chasing trends.

That's very different from the VC culture of \"growth at all costs,\" where branding is more important than discipline.  \n  \nOf course, the risk is that everyone will focus on one founder.

Vy's early support of SpaceX, $700 million investment in Twitter/X, and increased focus on Neuralink and xAI demonstrate a degree of alignment that is uncommon.

          "body": "When you're choosing between DIY and hiring someone, the easiest way to cut through the noise is to ignore the tools and look at the decision like a client, not a designer. A simple way to start is to check three things. Does the person have real examples that look like the style you want, can they show before and after work for similar businesses, and do they explain their process in plain language? \n\nMost small business owners pick designers based on those three signals long before they worry about platforms. Even if you DIY first, using those filters later makes it much easier to know who you can trust if you decide to bring in help.",

          "body": "Totally get this-finding a trustworthy web designer is way harder than it sounds! In the early days, I wrestled with the same “do it myself” vs “hire someone” dilemma. Honestly, if you’re just getting established, a simple site built on platforms like Squarespace or Wix (customized by you) often does the trick and gives you control at the start.\n\nIf you do hire, check for real client portfolios, read through detailed testimonials (not just star ratings), and ask for a quick call before committing. Freelance platforms like Upwork or local Facebook groups often surface solid folks with verifiable work. Recommendation: pick someone who communicates clearly-good designers explain the process and set expectations, not just drop a price.\n\nGetting it right isn’t just about the design, but finding someone who “gets” your brand and your goals. Good luck with your photography hustle-your work will look even more pro with the right site!",

I thought building my own site would be faster and cheaper, but I ended up burning weeks tweaking layouts, second guessing every section, and still feeling like the site didn’t match the level of my work. What finally pushed me to hire someone was realizing that my time was better spent shooting and getting clients, not learning web design from scratch.\n\nWhat actually helped me choose a designer wasn’t reviews but portfolio relevance. A designer who had already built sites for photographers understood things I never thought about gallery loading speed, how to structure project pages, how to highlight style instead of cluttering things with text, how clients navigate. I basically picked someone who had solved problems I didn’t even know existed.\n\nIf you want a simple filter to choose someone, look for three things: Portfolio that matches your industry or aesthetic. Clear pricing and clear scope no vague custom quote traps. Someone who explains their choices instead of just asking what do you want.\n\nAlso, do one paid small project first a landing page or a single portfolio layout before committing to a full site. It tells you everything about communication, quality, and whether they actually get your brand. Hope this helps you!",

Yes there are a lot of \"lipstick on a pig\" solutions that aren't that effective for tangible results.  We mainly see that with 19 year olds on social media flaunting rented Lambos.  However, you said it yourself OP, as long as it yields a return, who cares if it's AI?  In my experience, we keep our solutions simple and focused on mainly revenue generating activities.  AI isn't going anywhere but I'll agree that the bubble has a MAX of 2 years before it pops for sure.  I sold social media marketing services a few years ago and you would be amazed at how many business owners didn't know that it could help.

Investors have all sorts of rights now. He says they went behind his back more than once. He feels like they kind of pushed him out.\n\nFrom what I can tell, investors decide who stays or goes on the management team. They skip all emotion and just say they trust the system, not him. Reading between the lines, it sounds like they want him out, but they are not buying his shares, so he cannot leave.\n\nHe is stuck inside a company he started. It honestly sounds brutal. Almost like he never really learned how venture works until it was too late.\n\nStories like this remind me why I am bootstrapping my own project. No outside pressure, no board calls, no one ready to pull the rug out. I get to actually enjoy what I am building, set my own pace, and keep control. Sometimes I wonder if more founders would choose this way if they heard about the real tradeoffs up front.\n\nP.S. For those who’ve asked me in DMs, my project is called IGScraping.",

Three things I learned while running my own business that might help you:\n\n-\n1. You have to prioritise profit at some level; you need profit to invest in better software, staff, hardware, marketing, secure communication, data protection and on and on and on. Profit does not automatically equal exploitation. If you don't make money on top of your expenses you will not be able to grow efficiently, and efficient growth gives your employees more and improved resources, supports and non-monetary gains (gym memberships that are a tax write off for the business etc).\n\n\n2. Pay people to do things that they’re good at (this extends to software as well). Don’t waste your time being a bookkeeper with a spreadsheet when there is software or people that can do it quicker, cheaper and with their full focus. This applies to marketing, infrastructure, everything. At the start you have to do everything yourself but don’t make that period last any longer than it has to. \n\n\n3. You need to learn to look after yourself - you're current workload is unsustainable and will lead to health problems, and eventually burnout. I say this based on the fact I worked in a very similar way to you for most of my adult life (and doubly so for the 10 years I ran my business) until at 33 my brain and body decided enough was enough. I went from relatively healthy to now using a walker and being legally disabled. How will your staff be better off if you're not there. *Necessary disclaimer that my story isn’t your story, you are not me so what happened to me is indicative of what could happen to you - however there is plenty of evidence talking about the damage overworking does to our brain and body long term.*\n\n-\nYou're actually helping more than just your staff, you’re forcing your competitors to improve their conditions to retain good talent. You’re making a far bigger impact than you realise OP and for whatever it might be worth, I’m proud of you.\n\n**ETA -** Edited to fix markdown because I'm an idiot",

But you made something valuable with quite some risk of failure.\n\nNow you take on these employees, you're treating them far better than your competition, better pay, benefits, overall attitude and treatment, they provide value to you and value to your customers and you give them value in that money, benefits, treatment etc. \n\nSo you created something with some value, brought people in who are creating value and you give them something of value in exchange. \n\nYou see then you aren't stealing from anyone. What you did is you created value that wasn't there before, you then gave some of that to your employees who go out creating more value for you. Everyone is working to grow the value given to others. \n\nObviously you pointed out it's commission based so the more customers you bring on means the more they can make, you aren't knee capping earning to hourly.\n\nAll profit is simply the excess value you created coming back. At least that's how I see it.",

If you’re not setting some aside for uncertain circumstances, and not paying yourself enough to take care of yourself in uncertain circumstances, then you’re risking their careers and the whole company if something comes up.

It can create a perception that you are doing far better than you are and people get used to it even if they’re under qualified for their salary in reality.

The other thing is that you also had a higher risk in the beginning. So obviously now the reward comes with that risk. It's the flip side of it. And I'm guessing that your reward package is different from your employees because they have social security and other forms of compensation perhaps (holiday allowance, insurance, retirement, etc.) and even if there's less work, they're still being paid. And there's many other differences between employees and employers in terms of risks and reward.  \n  \nNot sure if it changes anything but at least for me realizing this sometimes helps to put things in perspective, even though I still recognize what you're describing.

All of the posts in here are rationalizations for that fact. \n\nBut it's the system we have for now, and if you didn't do it there would be less sympathetic bosses taking your place.  There are more ethical ways to run your business within this system, but then you'll have to accept that your mission is to build something sustainable and more ethical, rather than outcompeting others.",

Get a public profile with automatically verified traffic  \n  \n3. Receive a free dofollow backlink  \n  \nNo loopholes, no number editing access, no human review needed.   \n  \nIt even comes with a monthly traffic leaderboard so you can see where you stand, as well as a leaderboard showing the countries with websites that have the most traffic.\n\nWould love to hear what you wonderful people think",

This post resonates because nobody tells you that entrepreneurship doesn't just test your business skills - it strips you down to your raw humanity.\n\nWhen our biggest client canceled a $400K order overnight in 2022, I didn't just lose revenue. I lost my ability to pay 59 workers who depended on me. I spent three nights sleeping on the factory floor because I was too ashamed to face my family. The 'boss' everyone saw during daytime video calls was a shell - inside, I was a 39-year-old man who hadn't eaten properly in weeks, wondering if I should just close the doors and get a real job.\n\nHere's what entrepreneurship actually is: it's looking your seamstress in the eyes when you can't pay her on time and explaining why. It's hand-delivering finished goods on your motorcycle at 2AM because the shipping company failed you. It's learning that your 'passion for fashion' means nothing when a client demands you redo 500 dresses three days before Christmas.\n\nI thought being an entrepreneur meant creative freedom. What it actually means is becoming the human safety net for everyone else's problems. The workers who need salaries, the clients who need deadlines met, the suppliers who need payments. Your personal anxiety becomes a luxury you can't afford.\n\nBut here's the unexpected gift: that confrontation forged me into someone I never knew I could be. Two years later, we survived. We now work with 15 international brands, and I've learned to build systems that protect both my team and my sanity. I take Sundays completely off - no emails, no calls - because I finally understand that sustainable businesses are built by sustainable humans.\n\nThe freedom isn't in being your own boss. The real freedom is knowing your breaking point and having the courage to build guardrails before you reach it. To everyone considering entrepreneurship: ask yourself not 'What's my business plan?' but 'Who will I become when everything falls apart?' That's the question nobody prepares you for.",

At least your old boss went home at 5pm.\n\nThe \"freedom\" narrative is bullshit. You don't get freedom - you get responsibility for everything. When the website crashes at 2am, guess who's fixing it? When a client doesn't pay, guess who's chasing them down? When you're sick, guess who's still working?\n\nBut here's what really separates the real entrepreneurs from the dreamers: Real entrepreneurs can't NOT do it. They're not choosing entrepreneurship because it's easier or more glamorous. They're choosing it because working for someone else feels like wearing shoes that are three sizes too small.\n\nIf you can be happy as an employee, be an employee. Get good at it, negotiate better pay, and invest wisely.

Instead, the ERP ended up exposing the same issues they already had: inconsistent receiving, undocumented stock movements, incomplete BOMs, and irregular counting routines.\n\nOn the other hand, I’ve also seen small teams using modest ERPs achieve excellent accuracy simply because their SOPs were clear, enforced, and part of daily operations.\n\nThe ERP is just a tool. If the underlying process is weak, the system amplifies the chaos. If the process is strong, the ERP becomes a powerful enabler.\n\nSo after many years around these systems, my biggest takeaway is this:  \n**Get the SOPs right first. The technology will only perform as well as the discipline behind it.**",

And they are happier than ever before.\\]*\n\n**Objective**: So, **your main goal is to appear in front of the right audience. That is it!!!!**.   \n  \nThere are 1000s of people around the world desperately searching for products and services like yours. You have to showcase your services in front of them.. Simple!!\n\n**Methods**: To appear, you need to create content in the way your audience searches for it. \n\n\\- Do not create what you think is right. Think from your audience’s mind-\n\n  \nCreate only **valuable+unique+informative** content**.**\n\nContent means blogging, short videos, explanatory videos, and social media posts.\n\nYour 100 days goal must be like this:\n\n* 150 blogs, SEO optimized \\[800 to 1k words each\\]\n* 200 short videos\n* 50 explanatory videos\n* 300 answers/engagement on Q&amp;A forums\n* Promote all this content on more than 6 social media platforms\n* Comment and link on others posts and content on social media\n* Get ranked on Google's 1st page from at least 3 keywords\n* Submit your product/services on at least 50 directories\n\nKeep doing this for the next one 100 days and you will see a MIRACLE . Yes, trust me, your sales will skyrocket.\n\n**No need to burn your money on ads. Use these methods together and your inbox will be filled with inquiries and payment invoices.**\n\nThis is the only formula that works. The rest is noise. No hack or shortcut ever works.\n\n*Whatever you are expert in, sell it to others, your services or your products.*  \n*And if you do not have anything yet, you can create your own app and sell it to others. Use Build with Gemini or any other no code app platform. Although they are not as easy as they claim, you can still build a usable app in about 7 days.*\n\nI hope this helps........\n\nI have kept this post very short. If you are confused or not getting anything, feel free to ask. I would love to explain.\n\nThanks...",

      "selftext": "I'm 26 years old and I've been unemployed for the last 9 years. I live off of the government, my parents, and side hustles whenever I can get one. In short I'm chronically unemployed. The last time I had a actual job I was 18 years old. Last month I decided to start a startup mostly because I'm unemployed and everything else I've tried to do failed miserably. I'd like to proudly say  that I got my first legit meeting with a investor after they read my pitch deck. I'm really happy especially since I've been working on this for a month. Before this I haven't experienced any success in anything. Any advice?",

Back yourself because no one else will if you don't \n2. Don't put yourself down in front of others\n3. Be consistent (this might be your problem, I am just assuming due to unemployment and I get it, been there done that)\n\nThose 3 things changed my life for the better.\nAnd yes, Big Congratulations this is just the start.

So why not do the same for yourself instead of doing it for someone else?\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with working for money, making profit, hiring people, and improving your own life while helping others earn too. Not every business has to be life-changing. Sometimes you start, make it work, and the meaning shows up later.",

You just need a reason that feels real to you.\n\nA lot of people I’ve seen (and worked with) find meaning in the small things. They like solving problems. They like giving customers something that actually works. They like the freedom the business gives them. They like seeing an idea turn into a sale. That alone can feel satisfying even if the product is not saving the world.\n\nAnd honestly, most businesses look “shallow” from the outside. But to the customer, a good perfume, a good bag, a good tool, a good service can make their day easier. You do change someone’s life in a small way. You make their world smoother. That still counts.\n\nMoney can be a motivation, but it doesn’t have to be the only one. Some people find meaning in building something stable. Some in helping their family. Some in creating a lifestyle they actually enjoy. Some in the craft of running the business itself.\n\nIf you wait for a “big” purpose before you start, you’ll stall forever. Most people find their meaning after they start, not before. You niche down, you learn who your ideal customer is, you dial in your offer, and somewhere in that process you feel the spark.",

All of this feels like marketing finally shifted from static campaigns to a living system that learns and improves on its own and have the space to add the creativity.\n* Second is an automation for my entire company using external tools that automatically spies on competitors to help identity content keyword gaps and publishes blogs on our website to outrank them on Google for searches! It then uses Google search console data to refine the content strategy every month based on results! It can also look at current trends in our industry and come up with blogs based on these as well!\n* Finally, In a 10k+ org we use to wait for days and weeks to get analysis on our marketing performance before we can plan our next move. Now with AI we are able to do this in hours without relying on internal team to pull data for us.\n\nWhat didn't really work out for was AI SDRS! We found that personalized outreach on Linkedin, Email etc performed worse that simple short messages! People seem to smell AI messages from miles away now! Curious what others are upto tho :)",

Buyers knew exactly what they wanted, but it was often hard to find these technical books at local bookstores. Amazon delivered them to you. These technical books were their beachhead.\n\nThis allowed them to prove themselves and they quickly expanded to other books, then DVDs then home goods. Now Amazon is the everything store.\n\nIf you are just starting or trying to grow your business think carefully about your market entry strategy. You can't sell to everyone at first.

If it's a low cost item, it's still the same concepts but a faster process. \n\nThe first thing is to schedule a face to face meeting. Zoom is OK but if the product is tangible, meeting in person is best. \n\nIn the meeting, try to establish rapport if possible. This is an advanced skill but if you can do it, do it. If you can't, don't. There is nothing worse than insencerity or patronizing behavior. \n\nThe next step is consultation. When you're meeting with a potential client, ask then what their problem or need is and why they considered your product. Let them speak. Don't rush this part of the process. Don't draw it out more than you need to either. Ask lots of questions about their goals and make sure you have a solution. If you don't have the solution, stop right there. Don't sell a square block to fit a round hole. That will lead to bad reviews.\n\nOnce they are done giving you their needs and wants list, explain why your product can solve their problem. If possible, provide a demo of the product. \n\nThe next step is to see what objections they may have. To do this, ask what questions they have about the product or service. Once you answer the questions, ask if there are any more questions. Repeat this process until they are certian your product is the right choice for their issue. \n\nThe last step is to assume the sale and proceed to the close. In this step, you want to essentially ask them if they are ready to buy. If they say no, there are usually only a few reasons. 1. They don't have the money. 2. They aren't a serious buyer. 3. They aren't convinced that your product is the solution. 4. There is a better price elsewhere. 5. They need to think about it. \n\nIf you can, offer financing for 1. You're not a bank but you can find someone who will help finance most purchases for your clients. \n\nYou can't do anything about 2. Just politely walk away. \n\nIf it's 3, go back to the question and answer phase.\n\nIf it's 4, ask them what is stopping them from buying. If the competition has a better product, see how you can provide a competitive advantage (lower price, faster delivery, guarantee of some sort, etc).\n\nIf it's 5, thank them for their time and schedule a follow up meeting at a later date. Where possible, cut the date time in half. If they say give them a month, follow up in two weeks. The followup can be simple. Hey it's me, I just wanted to see if you have any questions about &lt;product&gt;. \n\nAsk me any questions.",

So, it necessitates identifying potential customers, understanding their needs, presenting solutions, handling objections, and earning their trust for deals. At its core, sales is about building relationships and delivering value by matching customer problems with appropriate solutions, creating mutual benefit for both buyer and seller.\n \nNow what can learn from the other resposes to your post?\n\nPeople from people, where they will ask from you if your communication is spot on. Here is the good news, it is rare that anyone is spot on on communication.\n\nSecond, you have goals for what you want to earn.  As you communicate to clients, you will learn their goals if you earn their ear, interest, and trust. Some would say learing to communicate at the buyer's listening level to be the art of sale or 20% of the sales engagement.  For example, if i understand Mr.Client this issue is burning a hole in your pocked book. So, if you had something that would solve this issue. Then you would take it.  As it happens, I have it right here.  Check it out. Oh wow, that's exactly what I need. How much to take it off your hands.\n\nThird, to achieve your goals and gain an opportunity to communicate with clients generally requires a system or processes to get there. These proceses are 80%of the sales engagement.  It needs to be applied consistently and at  a regular cadence.  For example, what is your strategy, who is your ideal customer profile, what are the ways to reach them, how will you communicate to them, what are the systems you have in place to help the processes and more.\n\nI had a ton of help in my sales success. It sounds like it is similar to those who replied to your post. Therefore, you can learn in this Reddit at no cost.  Guess what, what, how, when, why, who to ask questions is an art and a vital sales skills.  Additionally, you can chat with everyone who responded directly, if they agree.  I for one have no issue.  As for expensive, there are plenty of good coaches out there who charge between $150 to $500 an hour.  The gap is if they need to do some homerork to help you in your situation.  There are also good ones who deliver workshops, and more where you can learn.\n\nLet us know how we can help.",

A potential client reached out last month saying she's a solo entrepreneur trying to launch her first product line but \"really struggling financially\" and could I please work with her at a reduced rate.\n\nI felt bad for her. We've all been there right? So I gave her 30% off my normal rate, brought my project fee down from $4500 to $3000. Told her I remember what it's like starting out and I wanted to help.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. I'm helping her evaluate supplier quotes and she casually mentions she's trying to decide between putting 45k or 60k into her first inventory order. Then she's talking about her \"backup funds\" in case the product doesn't perform well.\n\nI didn't say anything but later I'm thinking wait, if you have 60k liquid to drop on inventory plus backup funds, why were you crying poor about my consulting fee?\n\nSo I did something probably unethical. I looked her up. Her LLC is registered, public record. I found her personal LinkedIn. She's not some struggling entrepreneur. She sold a previous company two years ago. I can't find exact numbers but based on the acquisition announcement and her current lifestyle posts it wasn't small.\n\nShe straight up lied to me to get a discount.\n\nNow I'm sitting here feeling like a complete idiot. I gave her a discount because I thought I was helping someone bootstrap their dream. Turns out she was just negotiating and I fell for the sob story.\n\nPart of me wants to tell her I know and revise my rate back to normal for the remaining work. But we're halfway through the project and I already agreed to the price. Plus if she refers other clients to me that's probably worth more than the $1500 I'm losing here.\n\nBut I'm also pissed. I've turned down two other inquiries this month because I'm at capacity and I'm working with her at a discount while she's sitting on what looks like serious money.\n\nMy wife thinks I should just finish the project and never work with her again. My business partner thinks I should confront her because she disrespected my work and wasted my goodwill.\n\nHonestly I don't even know what the right move is here. I keep thinking about all the hours I'm putting in at a reduced rate while she probably thinks she played me perfectly. Maybe she did.\n\nI'm going to finish the project and chalk it up to a learning experience. On the bright side, at least the supplier research part has gotten easier since I started using SourceReady for vetting manufacturers. Wish there was something similar for client vetting though, would've saved me from this mess.",

If the discount is conditional, make it clear.\n\nSo if your normal price is $4500 and you want to give a low income discount, you quote $3000 and state \"30% low income discount\". That way you have something to argue if you discover circumstances aren't what you were told.\n\nBut it's incredibly difficult to row back on a discount once given.  It does at least give you a clear reason not to repeat the discount for future work.\n\n&gt;*So I did something probably unethical. I looked her up. Her LLC is registered, public record. I found her personal LinkedIn. She's not some struggling entrepreneur. She sold a previous company two years ago. I can't find exact numbers but based on the acquisition announcement and her current lifestyle posts it wasn't small.*\n\nIt's not unethical.  It's due diligence.  You should always check out your clients.  It's irresponsible not to.\n\nFinish the project.  Take it as an relatively cheap lesson that you should check out your clients more carefully in future.  Don't rule out working for her again, at least you have the measure of her now.",

We were working on the branding stuff for his new business, the early stage bits, figuring out the look and feel and how he wanted the whole thing to show up.\n\nThen bad luck hit. I got slammed with this severe liver inflammation thing. The doctor told me to stay in bed for 2–3 weeks and cut my workload down so I could actually rest. I was upfront with my client about it, and he was super cool. I even managed to send small updates here and there so the project didn’t stall completely..\n\nBut after a point he just stopped replying. No “hey I need a break,” no “I’m rethinking things,” nothing. Two weeks go by. Nothing. I figured he was busy, but after the third week of being left on read, it hit me that the guy I thought was a long-term partner had just ghosted me without a word .\n\nFast forward to last week, I was scrolling through a business subreddit and saw a familiar brand name on my feed. It was him. He was asking for advice on his DIY branding and positioning assets he generated using some online tool. The stuff he posted was nothing like what he first told me he wanted. It honestly felt like he’d gone in the opposite direction overnight.\n\nTurns out some clients don’t tell you what’s bothering them. They’d rather ask the internet than have a simple five minute conversation.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with something like this or am I just catching weird luck lately ?",

Some things to consider:  A relationship where money only flows in one direction in exchange for goods and/or services is never a “partnership.”\n\nYou are a “vendor” to the customer even if you’ve felt a deeper connection and been made to feel integral to their success. Cheaper, flashier, faster comes along and bats their eyes and gives a sly smile and a wink at the customer every day in the form of competition. These days a competitor is the sweet, seductive sounds of AI, and the continuous news stories we hear of “AI to replace ‘x’ number of jobs.\n\nSo your biggest take away should be asking: how do I keep/retain my best clients? What process do I have to always be prospecting for new clients? If I ranked my clients into A,B,C,D list \n“buckets” - how quickly can I fire my D list clients and replace them with A list preferably or B list that I can develop into A list? \n\nAnd lastly, re: retention - any time a single client makes up more than 25% of revenue you are at risk. You inevitably start putting more effort into that account to the demise of your other clients. Come up with a feedback process that allows you to pulse check every account on a regular basis - and even if you get “We love you and will name our first born after you” - always be prospecting for a replacement client. They are always looking for ways to cut costs.",

          "body": "About eight years ago, I had pneumonia. It was bad enough that I was in the hospital for 5 days. On my first day in the hospital (here is a lot of waiting around in hospitals), I mapped out a plan for my clients. I contacted each of them to let them know what was going on and that I would likely not be able to work for the coming month at least. I then acted as matchmaker and helped find each of them qualified people to do the work to ensure their schedules were met. \n\nMy job is to help my clients meet their goals and in that moment, I simply wasn't that person. I sucked to give away clients I had worked so hard to get. And I lost a lot of potential income through my illness and recovery.  I was at least able to help them meet their goals by shepherding them to good designers who could do the work I was unable to do.  And I maintained my reputation and several clients came back to do more work with me.",

          "body": "It reminds of something that has always perplexed me. I write business plans. I've written 2,000+ plans since 2006, have been subcontracting for years, and the clients I serve have paid $2-3,000 for their plan. Every once in a while, a client will take the plan I have written, show it to someone who has no experience writing plans, at least not anywhere near as much as I do, they'll get some negative feedback, and then they'll come running to me and tell me to \"fix it.\" There are at least three distinct versions of this story - but I'll just stop here to keep it short. \n\nIt never ceases to amaze me how a client will pay thousands of dollars for an expert consultant like me to do work, then show it to someone with comparatively no experience and come back to me and make me to do what the inexperienced contact said needs to be done. All of a sudden, I'm the dumbest guy in the room?! I never get over it. But along similar lines I learned when I started out as a business planning consultant that people don't want me to tell them what to do, they want me to do what they tell me to do.\n\nLesson learned in the twilight zone: 99% of the time 99% of entrepreneurs want to be the Boss in all their dealings.  \n\nSo, now I tell all my clients, as your consultant I'll tell you everything I know, and you'll always have the last word. And whatever they do on their own will never surprise me again. It might aggravate me, but it won't surprise me. In fairness to business owners, I think it has something to do with the personality type of the entrepreneur.  We are likely to be a bit of a control freak anyway, and one who will play all ends against the middle by our very nature just to make sure we come out on top. \n\nYou might hate to hear me say this, but you can never allow one client to become the be-all and end-all of your business. No matter how much money they give you, the lifeblood of your business can never depend on only one client because if they go south, then you will suffer mightily. Nothing feels better than landing a whale of a client, and nothing hurts worse than when they turn their back on you. In fact, part of the reason, they turned their back on you might be so they wouldn't have to depend on YOU too much.\n\nThere is one particular category of entrepreneurs that almost always does this as a matter of routine practice, and they think it automatically makes them smarter, even though it doesn't. Don't sweat it - it's not you, it's them. On the brightest side: they're neurotic about winning. On the darkest side: they don't know what they're doing, and they don't know how to spend their money. Make it make sense\\~\\~ \n\nP.S. Old joke: an entrepreneur is a person who wants to start their own business and they're not sure how to do it, but they're not going to let a little thing like that stop them. Sometimes you have to laugh to keep from crying\\~\\~ \n\nP.P.S. Your supreme challenge is this: can you respect their universal grope for entrepreneurial wisdom and remain friendly with them? I'm not saying you have to like them, but if you can at least remain calm and friendly if you ever talk to them again, I promise you'll be much stronger for it. And I didn't say it was going to be easy, that's why it's your supreme challenge. Besides, there are plenty of fish in the sea, and plenty of whales ...",

He assumed that we just wanted to keep him on retainer so he didn’t say anything  \nFirst of all retainer is CRAZY. He just kept getting paid because nobody turned off the recurring payment when the project ended!!!!  \nI checked with the team and everyone thought someone else was still using him for stuff. We’re 24 people like how does something like this even happen?\n\nApparently he’s been receiving 1.5k every month for 10 months and figured we knew what we were doing which honestly fair cuz that’s on us not him  \nThe worst part is he’s a nice guy and offered to pay some of it back but like legally that’s our fuckup not his. We just gave him $15k for nothing because nobody communicated...........\n\nHow do you deal with this if you don't have a proper financial team set up?",

It indicates whether the person is on retainer or not. \n\nThis stuff isn't hard. It just takes someone dedicated to setting up processes in your business. Someone needs to take on the role of operations and implement standard operating procedures.\n\nLastly, the designer you overpaid needs to pay back the money.

The breakdown wasn’t noticing the expense, it was assumptions and communication. This was a known vendor, so the expense was assumed to be valid and being used by one of the 24 employees. Everyone assumed that someone else was using him each month. \n\nIt seems to me that this is more likely solved by having a designated point person for each business activities. That person knows whether any dies in services are being used, and if a department needs design services they talk to the lead and ask for the services. I’ve had it in my business too where people assume the other needed to buy that thing, when no one was really managing it.\n\nAnd this is really dependent on the size of the business. No matter how many financial reviews I’d have with budgets and expenses, $1500 a month wouldn’t show up unless we pulled up a transaction list and reviewed it. A larger business will have too many to go through. I have people who do go through every transaction, just like OP, but again they assumed it was legit. \n\nA business transaction $10k-$20k per month would notice and correct this before it was paid that first month.

And he kept getting paid something like $400/hr for every timesheet he put in, including any overtime he decided to rack up.\n\nNearly a year later, someone started asking questions, and he was (finally) kicked off the contract. But the department couldn't recover the better part of a million dollars they'd paid him by then; he'd quietly followed all the rules of the original contract, done all the work his many, many bosses had tossed his way, and the switchover from hourly rates wasn't something which happened automatically on a given date - it had to be signed off by one of the managers employing him.",

He turned into someone completely different, never helped with anything and I was sick of it. I finally got him to agree on selling the business and parting ways and it was delay after delay. “One more push to get our profits up so we can sell for more”. That never stopped and finally he said I don’t want to sell anymore. I said f it, and asked for his terms for me to exit. I have no regrets. Outside of the partnership being a disaster dealing with employee BS, complete gut punches anytime there was a negative review, things seeming like they are going great and getting hit with a shit pile. I couldn’t do it anymore. I tried doing it differently, I tried sticking it out, I tried new methods of communication, I tried everything. \n\nWhat I am grateful for is I went through severe burnout for the first year and mapped out everything I was spending time on, started journaling and meditating and these two things alone changed my life for the better. I was able to manage the shit storm of the small business, but ultimately saw no end in sight. I know social media makes it seem like you should never quit, keep going, grind it out, it will get better. Sure maybe. But also it might not. What’s your piece of mind worth? I lost money, but guess what? before I stopped I was losing money, my time, and my peace of mind. So I decided I only wanted to lose money moving forward. \n\nWill I start another business? Yes, but it will be under my terms and with more clarity. If you feel like you’re never moving forward it’s ok to stop. Chances are you’ve learned a shit ton, and can takeaway some great things from the experience as I did. \n\nIt’s ok to step away. You didn’t fail, you learned. This is not advice to quit but rather determine whether or not it’s time to move on or change how things are going. \n\nHope you can take your life back one way or another.

Without strategies, you plateau at your or your team's capacity and stay there forever. Without goals, you can't put bad days into context of something greater and you'll spiral. \n\nI was just talking to a candle company owner, she said that she was in about this exact place and ready to shut everything down. Her biggest change was just scheduling production days, email hours, and making a round-number revenue goal from which to work backward. Since making those changes, she has acquired three companies and blew her not modest revenue goal out of the water. \n\nYou can do this, you just need to step back and look at what you're doing.",

      "selftext": "I closed my Delaware LLC last week and I can finally breathe, like actually breathe for the first time in months.\n\nI started this business with my partner, we had this whole vision but... it just didn't work out… wasn’t a dramatic failure story, we just couldn't make the numbers work and kept bleeding money until we made the call to shut down and heck saying goodbye to something you built hurts no matter what…. But we had to let go and I thought it'd be quick, maybe a few weeks of paperwork to get it down but wow was I wrong like nobody warned me about the actual shutdown part like you spend all this energy building something and then when it's time to close it down you're just... exhausted already, uk? And then Delaware needs this form, IRS needs that form, you're chasing down old contracts you forgot existed, a software subscription still charging u monthly, and man let me tell you this but every time I thought we were done, something else popped up. And I had to endure this for 2 months. Two whole months of this, two months of feeling like I couldn't move forward because I was stuck dealing with the past. My partner checked out emotionally pretty early, so most of it fell on me to the point where there were days I just wanted to walk away from the whole thing but kept thinking about what happens if I miss something important, what if Delaware keeps billing me or we get sued years from now because I didn't file something right.\n\nBut yeah, it's over now. Really over. And I'm sitting here feeling this weird mix of sad and relieved and tired and kind of excited? Like I can finally think about what's next without this thing hanging over me.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next tbh, I might start something new eventually, might just work for someone else for a while and not think about any of this.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to share because I see a lot of startup content but nobody really talks about this part it's messy and it sucks and it costs more than you think but you get through it eventually",

My brain was fried, it wasnt even a celebration, more like a reset. For the next one, I'm say go with your vision and your convictions 100%. \n\nI learned the hard way to never do business with family or anyone who can't follow your vision. Not understand it, just stfu and follow it, do what I say. No unsolicited opinions. And thats a big thing when you open a new business, every asshole loves to give advice. \n\nWe closed it in 2017 after 3 years and to this day we sometimes talk about it and the regrets. Everyone had their own vision, their own shit ideas. They all agreed on my original business plan but then shit kept changing on a whim.\n\nMe and my parents were on the same page but when it came to execution of the business, our relatives fucked it up. Shouldn't have gotten involved in the first place.\n\nOur vision was changed and relatives kind of took over. My parents went along with it because they felt like they had no choice.\n\nIt built so much resentment, even from me to my parents because they let it happen. I wasn't in the position to tell my relatives anything, but they were. \n\nIt was such a shitshow. Hard lessons though, fuck if we had done my original plan, it would've been successful. I see it everywhere now, our original idea for that location was executed better by other people because they did it correctly. Multiple different businesses are thriving there now, with the same vision I had before all of em. \n\nAnyway, it sucks but we learned so much from that. Mostly the psychology side of it like you can't be nice and let people walk all over you, even family. Can't be too nice to employees, and definitely should've shelled out some money to hire an experienced manager. They cheaped out on that too. \n\nI'm going to start a business again in the coming months, this time I've been researching and planning much more thoroughly. \n\nThis time it will be a singular vision. My vision. No one gets to fuck with it. No one gets to give me advice on what to do, and get butthurt if I don't follow their bullshit. \n\nIf they don't like it, they're fired. I'm steve jobbing the fuck out of this thing. That is the only way. Good luck on the next one.",

There is a good chance a little entrepreneurial devil will whisper things in your ear again one day...but until then, take a nice clean break.\n\nPS: Your story really talks to the merit of having a partner vs going solo. Many assume you just need a partner but if you are really motivated, and don't want to waste time debating every issue - and don't want to be let down - going solo has a lot going for it too. I did both and for me anyway, the solo route was the better option.\n\nI wish you well. Take it easy for a bit. Cheers.",

          "body": "Most start ups in any sector are like this. The founders have to do everything until they outsource, hire, or automate. \n\nIn some ways, doing everything teaches you very quickly what you need to get ride or and how much you will pay to get rid of it. \n\nAn office manager (VA, etc) might be the first hire so you can focus on revenue generating tasks. Automation that you can easy into is also a focus in the early days. Even if there is only 1-3 things you can automate, the sooner you get that stuff off your desk, the better off you will be. Do not wait until you are 100% busy as the transition (outsourcing, training, automation) will soak up some time. Better to commit to a transition when you are at 70% to 80% of capacity.\n\nExpect the early efforts to outsource, hire, automate will stumble or not be smooth. It is all part of the learning to be a CEO rather than the production person.\n\nI am working with a company right now who is very busy with the work so it is hard for them to focus on automation. We are getting there. Presently, it is a grind (long days and me providing the automation help). For another client, they have more capacity yet they really need to focus on more sales so they can afford some of the costs to scale up the team plus automate.\n\nA bit chicken and egg is my message. As someone else said, you need spare cash to fund the business growth. Working on the business vs in the business. The working on requires a bit of cash now so you can gain more than it costs in benefits later.\n\nThere is no magic here. There are things you did not know or did not understand. Normal for a young business when the founders have not built a company in the past.\n\nA business that keeps you busy and never grows is a lifestyle company or a hobby. If you want growth, there has to be time and money invested in working on the business.\n\nGood luck. Reach out if you want to chat further. Or, keep posting questions in the group and leverage the experience of those who are already where you want to be.",

When I first started out, I literally had a sticky note on my monitor that said \"you are the janitor AND the CEO\" because I kept forgetting I had to do literally everything myself.\n\n\n\nThe worst part is when you realize you're spending more time ON the business than IN the business. Like you said, days go by and you're like \"wait, did I actually do any real work or just shuffle papers and respond to emails?\" I used to joke that I became a professional email answerer who occasionally did the thing I actually started the business to do.\n\n\n\nWhat helped me was timeboxing all that admin stuff into specific blocks. Tuesday mornings became my \"business operations\" time where I'd batch all the receipts, forms, emails that weren't urgent, etc. It felt weird at first because you feel like you should be \"working\" but honestly? That IS the work when you're solo. The key is just not letting it take over your entire day every day. I also started keeping a running list on my phone of all the random business tasks that popped up so I could deal with them during those scheduled times instead of dropping everything every time something came up.\n\n\n\nThe tax stuff though... yeah that never gets easier. I still have a folder labeled \"things my accountant will explain to me like I'm 5\" because some of that stuff just makes no sense.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.",

Stuff like tracking receipts, organizing expenses, and staying on top of tax prep is important, but it does not have to be done by you. That is exactly the kind of work a good bookkeeper can take off your plate. I work with Linda Rost’s Better Bookkeepers, and people in her lane basically specialize in turning that pile of “admin and tax stuff I don’t understand” into a simple, organized system you barely have to think about.\n\nYou are not failing at business; you are just hitting the point where doing everything yourself stops making sense.

Cut the number of things you own. If you touch everything, no habit will save you. Put your efforts on keeping it simple.\n2. Set a hard stop for the day.

This is the only way you'll know what you have time for.   \n  \nI follow the mantra ***\"****Create in the AM, Connect in the PM,*\" but depending on your own energy patters use your energetic hours to do creative things, use your wind down time to do meetings and connect with people. If you have an extra five minutes, use the mantra \"*Do One Thing.*\" It might be one thing not on the list, one thing from tomorrows list, one extra thing, or just one thing. When you're really fried, use the mantra \"*Every little bit counts.\"* This will remind you that even if you simply make one phone call or take out the trash, that you're making progress.   \n  \nWhen you get something done, physically cross it off with a pen. If you need to add something, write it down. Next day edit the list from the day before, rinse and repeat.\n\nI'm sure there is science around this, but there is something magical that happens in this old school process. The brain dump reduces anxiety because you're not holding things in your head hoping they won't fall out. Creating the list each morning is very zen, and crossing things off is very affirming. There is no app in the world that works this well.

      "selftext": "Earlier this year I left construction to work for a small startup. They sold me on equity, growth potential, all that stuff. I took a massive pay cut because I genuinely believed in it.\n\nSpent the last few months learning everything - cold email, LinkedIn outreach automations, n8n automations , lead gen. I was actually pretty good at it. Booked them a ton of calls. \n\nBut they ran out of money and couldn't keep me on. So that's that.\n\nAlso broke up with my girlfriend during all this. So now I'm single, broke, sitting on all these skills I don't really know what to do with.\n\nMy old construction job would probably take me back. Good money, stable work. But honestly the thought of going back feels like I failed. Like I wasted all this time learning stuff that doesn't matter.\n\nEveryone says \"just freelance\" or \"offer your services\" but like... I have no clients, no real portfolio, no clue where to start.\n\nBeen thinking about doing free work or super cheap work just to get case studies and actually talk to people. But idk if that's the move or if it just makes me look desperate.\n\nThe frustrating part is I can build websites fast now, set up email campaigns that work, automate outreach - all this stuff that should be useful. But none of it matters if I don't have anyone to actually do it for.\n\nHas anyone been through something like this? Like a career change that just feels completely stuck? How did you figure it out?",

          "body": "Don’t get hung up on the failure part. There are many reasons why a startup fails, and a lot of them are out of the control of individuals. Keep in mind that only 1% of startups ever make it big, and the next 20-30% have a mediocre exit often at a loss where employees don’t make much money at all. You could’ve been \"wasting\" years there and not make any money. That is to say, failure is an almost expected outcome for most startups. \n\nYet, if you understand the likely monetary outcome, joining a startup is an amazing opportunity to learn and grow on many dimensions. You said it yourself: you learned about a bunch of tools, techniques, and became good at it. Don’t discount how that may help in often unpredictable ways in the future. \n\nMy take: Go back to construction, own the experience and learn from it. Reframe the failure in your own mind. And rebuild your financial foundation and do some reflection over a year or so. If you want to give a startup another try you can always apply / look around in the future.",

But after doing some job searching and finding out about salaries and what jobs are less back breaking, I found that you can learn some things for free online and test out and get a certification. Of course this is something I’m mostly interested in. I’m looking to get into Cyber security. You can try Data Analyst, IT, and many other types of tech jobs. I’m not the smartest tool in the shed but I’ll tell you what, I can’t keep going on breaking my back for a job that if I get hurt I’m literally gonna lose everything and have no back up plan. Imagine getting a tech job and working from home. Not all tech jobs are like that but many are. Plus the starting salary will be comparable to what you’re likely already making, maybe 40-50k and after you get some experience that can go up to 70k to 100k+ depending on the field you’re getting into. Many variables like how big the company is and how much you keep learning and pushing yourself to the top. And I’m gonna be honest, you’re gonna need to spend probably about 4 hours a day studying and some certification exams cost about $350 or more. But people spend 80k to study this stuff in a college and go into debt. You can do it at home for a few thousand dollars and get multiple certificates in a year or two and start applying for jobs.",

Or find a position adjacent to the one you have learned.

If you were willing to jump into something new/risky you’re probably young and dedicated. I will always bet on someone who’s worked in the trades and is willing to take risks. \n\nI guess I have a few suggestions: \nPrioritize yourself and don’t question how valuable your services are\nPeople only value things that cost them; experiment with a price tag\nDo follow-up and track notes: a client chooses you, “why” and client chooses a competitor “is there anything I could have done different that would have made you choose me” a client decides they don’t have a need for your services “what growth would your company need to  experience before my services are necessary” \n\nFor me, going back to the old job wasn’t an option so I just accepted life would SUCK for a while.

          "body": "The \"no ads\" approach works until you need predictable revenue, then it becomes your biggest bottleneck. Organic growth through word-of-mouth and social content is great for validation, but it caps your growth at the speed people naturally share - which is slow and inconsistent.\n\n\n\nYour question about \"how to get customers fast\" reveals the core tension: fast customer acquisition requires paid distribution. You can't manufacture urgency and demand at scale without putting your offer in front of targeted audiences systematically. Facebook and Google ads let you control exactly who sees your cookies and when.\n\n\n\nStart with $10-15/day on Facebook ads targeting your local area with a simple offer: \"Handmade cookies delivered today in \\[your town\\]. Order by 2pm.\" Use photo carousel ads showing your actual cookies, not stock imagery. The algorithm will find people who click and convert within 3-5 days.\n\n\n\nThe mistake most food businesses make is waiting until they have \"perfect\" branding or enough inventory. Start running small test budgets now to learn what messaging works, then scale when you have capacity. Spending $300-500 in your first month will teach you more about customer acquisition than 6 months of organic posting.",

It recently became my responsibility to reconcile the UPS invoice we get weekly and it has become clear that UPS is essentially scamming us out of hundreds of dollars a week. I wanted to see if others have been having the same experience. \n\nWe are being hit with two surcharges mainly: “dimensional weight adjustments” &amp; “address corrections”. These sometimes amount to more than the original cost of the shipment, are often not valid and easily disputed, and feel very much like UPS attempting to skim money from businesses that are shipping enough to not be able to catch these additional fees. \n\nWhen speaking with our account executive, she mentions that they use an automated (I assume AI) system to image and measure packages. I’ve asked for proof from this system on a few occasions for dimensional adjustments and received nothing, but have had disputes accepted instead. She also has mentioned that the team that handles the surcharges is “third party and overseas”, which makes me think they are receiving a portion of these surcharges, incentivizing them to overcharge and not accept disputes. \n\nAnyway, just want to know if this is a common issue others who use UPS for 30+ shipments a week are experiencing.

It’s about leverage.\n\nWhen people first heard the term “AI automation,” they thought it meant we were going to build agents to replace every human. And to be fair, that idea exploded back in 2022 everyone was hyping up these giant end-to-end agents that were supposed to do every step of your workflow for you. But in the real world, those types of systems didn’t hold up they broke, they bottlenecked, and half the time they created more problems than they solved.\n\nSo businesses learned pretty quickly: full automation is not the goal.\n\nAI automation was never really about automation, it’s about leverage, and here’s what I mean by that:\n\nInstead of building for the sake of building, you need to understand and apply the Golden AI Ratio. It usually looks like this:\nAutomate the first 60% of the process, the boring, repetitive steps.\nUse AI to assist a human on the next 30% the parts requiring judgment or context.\nLeave the final 10% manual, because sometimes a human simply does it better.\n\nThis is what actually makes businesses faster, smarter, and more profitable.\n\nSo the real question isn’t “How do I automate everything?”\nIt’s “Where does AI give me the most leverage, and what ratio of AI-to-human will maximize that?”",

We've built workflows where 90% is automated because the process is purely data transformation with no judgment needed. And we've built others where it's more like 40/40/20 because the context changes constantly. The key isn't finding one perfect ratio, it's identifying which processes have consistent enough patterns to automate vs. which ones need human judgment.\n\nThe shift from \"automate everything\" to \"leverage strategically\" is where the real value unlocks. We burned $50k on a chatbot that tried to do too much autonomously before we learned this lesson. Now we design around what we call \"augmentation before automation\", get AI handling the repetitive context-gathering and formatting work, let humans make the judgment calls, and only fully automate the processes that are both high-volume AND low-complexity.\n\nCustomer support is a good test case. AI can pull order history and draft responses, but if your product changes weekly or your tone needs to match specific customer relationships, that 30% \"human assist\" portion gets a lot bigger. It's definitely not one-size-fits-all.",

Things like transcribing meeting notes, doing the initial sort of inbound emails, or pulling standard data for a weekly report. The goal was never to eliminate the person doing the job, but to eliminate the most tedious part of their job. It completely shifts their work from \"painstakingly building from scratch\" to \"quickly reviewing and refining,\" which frees up so much time and mental energy for the creative and strategic parts of their role that a human is genuinely better at.

I’ve never had a client behave like this and I don’t have a mentor to run this by.\n\n**The Context:**\n\n* I have a client who started construction **before** the building permit was issued. He is currently panicked because he’s risking a Stop Work Order or worse.\n* The City review process has been frustrating. The reviewer used generic \"boilerplate\" comments and didn't mark up/redline the reports, just the plans. This ambiguity caused a 3rd review cycle.\n* The City charged a re-submittal fee. It is **$150**.\n\n**The Conflict:**\n\n* The Client is demanding I pay this $150 fee out of my own pocket.\n* My contract (and industry standard) states that all agency/permit fees are the Owner's responsibility.\n* I am currently fighting the City to waive the fee on his behalf because I agree the review was lazy, but I told the Client I will not pay it personally if the waiver is denied.\n\n**The Behavior:**\n\n* He is texting me \"???\" late at night.\n* He told me \"I’m a businessman, I know how this works,\" and accused me of \"not taking ownership\" because I won't pay the $150.\n* **He has threatened to sue me.**\n\n**My Position:** I feel like he is projecting his anxiety about his illegal construction onto me. He wants me to pay the fee to validate his narrative that the delays are my fault, not the City's or his own. I’m holding the line on the $150 not because of the money, but because paying it feels like an admission of guilt/liability.\n\nHas anyone dealt with a client like this? Am I wrong for refusing to pay a small fee just to make him shut up, given that he’s already threatened legal action?\n\n**TL;DR:** Client building illegally is trying to bully me into paying a $150 City fee and threatening to sue.

Sometimes multiple times in a short period (15 mins and back in, all of them together). I don't want to automatically assume it's drugs, but that is my first thought. I'm in a small town of about 13k people. Even if it is drugs, I wouldn't believe it to be anything harder than a weed vape pen. It doesn't smell after they leave, and it's possible it isn't drugs at all, which is somehow more concerning. I've approached the door when they're in there, knocked and told them they need to leave and they won't unlock the door or respond. \n\nThere's a camera that can see the bathroom doorway and I'm considering locking the door and having customers need a key from the front desk and after I give the key to younger people, I'll need to watch the cc TV to verify only one person using the bathroom. I hate that I have to police the bathroom that way. \n\nHas anyone else had any experience with teens going to the bathroom together? This is both groups of boys and groups of girls (have yet to see both genders together). This seems super strange to me and my first thoughts of drug use, nefariousness or kiss just being idiots. None of which I want to tolerate. ",

He worked for the state, and the PTO credit could be counted on like clockwork. \n\nSo the day after his PTO hits, he calls in with some excuse. One of these excuses was that he's walking up some stairs, he slips, his knee hits the edge of the stair right between his kneecap and his leg, and because of this his leg is swollen and he cannot bend it. \n\nThis all sounds credible enough, and of course the friend likes to go in intricate detail to really sell the point. \n\nNow the funny part. When he finally does go back to work. He's committed to this scheme of having a knee injury so he commits to limping around. Not only this, but he figures that if it was a legitimate injury at the beginning of a shift he would limp just a little bit, and as the day progressed he would limp more and more and so that at the end of the day he was really limping. Now I know for a fact this was all I made up story because we were drinking buddies at the time and I heard him concoct the scheme before he even did it. \n\nOkay and so now the cherry on top. After doing this for a few days, because of knee injuries not just going to go way overnight right, he's actually given an accommodation and an official recognition of service because of his working injured.",

There are exactly two roads out of the valley, the Hwy and a paved county road on the other end of the valley. One morning about 5am I was on my way to work and got stopped because of a major accident on the Hwy, fire trucks, ambulances, police, you name it. Talked to the Sheriff on traffic duty and he figured at least two hours to clear the road. Sent a pic to my boss and said I would try and go the long way around but I would be at least a half hour late. Turned around and drove down to the County road just in time to watch a semi miss a curve coming down into the valley and jackknife across the entire road. Called it in to the Sheriff, sent a pick to my Boss saying \"You wouldn't believe me if I didn't show you but...\" and told him I was just going to take the day off and go home. His reply....\"Understandable\".",

      "selftext": "Edit: I ended up cutting him loose with a $1500 bonus. He said he understood and we ended on good terms. He had the opportunity to go back to an employer that can provide health insurance which he needs right now. It still doesn’t feel 100% right because I didn’t fulfill the initial agreement. I learned a lot about setting expectations with employees for next year to avoid this specific issue and other issues we had throughout the season (mostly pertaining to wage and drive time - which mostly comes back to me having bad planning and being bad setting expectations).\n\nI am a small business owner of a seasonal business. I just hired my first employee this year to help me. In the ad I put up on Craigslist, I mentioned there would be about 28-30 working days at a rate of $200 per day with a $1,000 bonus at the end of the year if he stayed with me the entire year.\n\nMy employee is excellent so I bumped him up to $220 per day with a few days of $300 and $360. Now we are getting toward the end of the season and I am realizing I can finish the remaining 7 work days on my own and there isn’t enough work to justify having an employee for those days. I would be losing out on about $1,500 by keeping him around but at the same time I feel obligated to keep him working because although there is no contract, I feel that I committed to the full season with him and I should just eat the cost and chalk it up as a learning experience.\n\nMy decision is between cutting him loose early and still paying him the $1000 bonus or keeping him on and eating the unnecessary cost of $1500.\n\nHas anyone been thru similar experiences?

          "body": "Do you want to keep this guy for next season ? I’m obviously not familiar with your business but as a small business owner of 25 years and 26 employees we’ve found that it’s been best practice to try and keep our staff and keep them tenured rather than rehiring . The opportunity costs in our business are pretty significant when it comes to training and getting staff up to speed. Our average staff tenure is going on 16 years, with some well above 20-25 years and you can’t overestimate the contribution made by experienced and well trained staff to the point we find things for them to do during slow periods just to keep them on even if some of it is low priority plus flexible work schedules and enhanced benefits. We’ve never done any sort of analysis but I suspect it costs us a lot more to train a new staff member anywhere from $10-15k per employee, compared to rewarding our experienced tenured staff a portion of this through quarterly and year end bonus. We just had two employees return after leaving the company in 2019 and 2022 and both were at least a year ahead of new staff members hired roughly the same time. Lots of opportunity costs when it comes to finding and training in our business. We will do almost anything, with reason to hold onto good talent. Not sure how hard this is for your business and industry. Keeping staff loyal has made our company what it is today which I’d say is modestly successful with year over year growth and the opportunity to increase revenue and profitability. I’m also a push over when it comes to these sorts of things but it has worked for us. The few new hires we have made end up being 50/50 in terms of their abilities and commitment but once we find someone we will try and do everything possible to keep them even if it costs us money in the short run. Sorry if we are comparing apples to oranges but I can’t emphasize just how important it has been for us to keep smart, hard working and loyal employees on staff rather than trying to replace them. During the pandemic when our business basically went from $16-17 mill in average revenue to literally $0 for about 2 years , we continued paying everyone a modified but liveable salary and we went millions 2 million into debt even with getting 2 forgivable PPP loan for almost $1 mill total, but we’re able to quickly retire that debt after 2 years whereas we’d still be pay that off if we had to restart with new hires or mostly new hires. I think doing the right thing when it comes to keeping promises has never been more important. Good luck and I hope you figure it out.",

I hope your girlfriend can find something she is passionate about and possibly make some friends along the way- if she is proud of you and speaks positively of your  work, that is a good sign, if she resents you for it most likely that will not change. I recommend at least spending one day a week spending much more quality time together than just an hour.",

Celebrate it! \n\nYour post really brings home that we don't usually talk about all of the things that are happening in our personal lives. Many entrepreneurs deal with incredible stressors as they are also trying to build, and we don't always have people to support us on the business side when the personal side gets hard. It sounds like you're figuring out how to balance both for now. I hope it continues to get better. \n\nI hope you get many more four figure deals!",

We worked all day, had dinner, ran errands, and crashed…..like most adults do.\n\nDoes she have enough good friends? Or is she one of those that dropped her friends when she started dating a new guy? Rhetorical, but that would explain her feeling lonely and craving the attention from you. If so, she needs to spend time with her friends. If not, she needs to join a club, get a hobby, get an additional part-time job, or do something to fill that void on her own, instead of depending on you to do that for her.",
