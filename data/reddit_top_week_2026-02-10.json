The admin side of medicine is at a weird limbo of claiming to need people but not having the resources to hire new people and train them.

I started with $1,000 and have flipped my way up into a $10,000 Challenger. I try to only buy or trade for “flashy” vehicles for they eye catching value marketing wise and it’s worked pretty well. What I can’t for the life of me figure out is how to narrow down my inbox to people who are actually serious and not wasting my time. If I post something for $6k I get 100 messages offering $3k when I clearly state “I will not take any less the $6k so please don’t ask.” I get 200 notifications and without responding to every single one I feel like I’ll miss that ONE that’s the sale/deal. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

Takes time to build up reviews but once you have them the work comes more regularly. I do basic stuff like content writing and data formatting. Started slow but it's been consistent for almost a year now.\n\nSurvey apps get a bad rep and honestly 90% of survey apps are useless. But there are a few reliable ones that have worked long term. Prolific and Babki are the main ones I still use after trying like 10 different platforms. Most survey apps either don't pay out or the availability drops off after a few weeks. These two have stayed consistent for me over several months.\n\nI'm curious what's worked for other people long term. Not looking for get rich quick stuff, more interested in realistic repeatable income that doesn't disappear after a month.\n\nJust want to hear what people have personally tested over time and what's actually sustainable.",

          "body": "Just flip stuff.\n\nDownload apps like DealScout and FreebieAlerts that send you push notifications when listings that match your search criteria are posted, and then just go pick up whatever deals look best. They send you push notifications as soon as things are listed so that you are the first one to be able to message and go get a really good deal if something is listed way below what it’s worth.\n\nIt’s something that you can do during your days off, but also something that you can do in the morning/evenings before and after work and you can do the searching/lock down deals while at work.   \n  \nI’ve seen people in this sub that have commutes that are two hours long set up the app to look for things along their path to and from work and then they just set up pick ups/drop offs along their commute and they make a couple hundred extra bucks every week pretty much just doing the same thing they’re already doing.\n\nThat’s how most of these big guys are flipping cars, couches, phones, and other types of stuff. They aren’t paying the normal prices that you see, they’re paying way less and they’re doing that by being the first one to go get these deals from these people that underprice them either because they don’t know the value, or don’t care about the value and just want it gone.\n\nMy advice would be just find something that you know a lot about, use an app to look for you, and just pick up the best deals and make sure that you’re the first message. Pretty easy to make a couple hundred extra bucks a week and 100% something you can do while working because it doesn't take any work to find these if you're doing it right, and then all of the actual \"work\" you have to do can happen before/after normal work hours",

      "selftext": "Hii,\n\nI’m a bit out of the teachers game. I taught until 2020, and then worked 4 years in education with the National Park Service. I’m now an educational outdoor ed program manager. I work adjacent to kids and teachers, but I am not day to day with them.\n\nI’m looking at boosting up my TPT store again, but am unsure of the market or what is popular. I’m doing this because my family cannot afford childcare in our area and continue to afford our healthcare needs. We need a financial cushion of about $1k extra a month. \n\nWe can’t budget our way out of this. We looked at every possibility and we are, quite frankly, fucked.\n\nmy husband already works overtime as a first responder. I’m salaried and need a “side hustle” to make any extra money. My thoughts are start and Etsy store or revamp my TPT store. Considering I have/had a semi successful TPT store, this seems more practical.\n\nContext. I had a TPT store from 2018-2020. I made about $200 a month when I tried regularly. Right now, I make about $60 a month on it. I don’t touch it at all. I mostly made content for middle school social studies. There are about 35 products on my store and 400 reviews. about 10 of those products male 90% of my sales. I’m not stating from scratch, but I’ve also never made big money either.\n\n$200 a month was myself as new teacher in her early 20s who didn’t understand a lot of things. My products were fine, but they could all use some good revamping. also this was before AI (or myself) could reliably proof read 😬\n\nMy questions are the following:\n\n1. What sells well for middle school now? what do you look for?\n2. Do products need to be digitized for Google Classroom? I have done this to a few. are there any other digital platforms forms to consider?\n3. I used to promote it via Pinterest. is there another platform to promote it on? Substack? what do yall use?\n4. Is $1k a month too lofty of a goal? hoping to dedicate 10 hours a week to it and would like to hit 1k by September to keep us from financial ruin.\n5. I also make a lot of cross grade “Buddy Activities” for work that are more geared towards lower grades. They aren’t elaborate but they are thoughtful and themed. Are these worth anything to teachers?\n\nMy plan is to revamp a lot of products and create some new ones about maybe more niche subjects i have experience in, such as California natural resources and geography. \n\nI’m open to feedback back and also willing to hear about other side hustles that have worked well for teachers ",

Another thing: to really learn and see results, no matter which side hustle you choose, you need to start taking action and testing things. If you can bring a computer and use it during your commute, you can start taking action.

Plus you’re 14, you won’t have an easy way of getting suppliers to work with you even if you tried. And half the crap you see online about it, it’s just influencers who don’t even go into the full scope of things. \n\nBut at 14 years old, I’d suggest putting that lawn mower to work. Ask any of your neighbors if they’d be willing to pay you to do their yards. Or if you live somewhere where it’s snowing, you could offer shoveling services. You could sell the oculus and ds I guess but it depends how much you list each item for and if anyone is willing to buy it off your hands in the first place. Maybe become a dog walker ?

Do a few cars on one city street and you've probably paid off a snowblower or two. A few bad snowstorms and you probably paid off the truck.\n\nYour rates could be adjusted based on the snow conditions. But all that could be done via the app. You could show up at a site, snap a photo of the parked car and say \"it's entombed in solid ice because it's on the corner where the plows dumped everything, so it'll be more.\" in a text to the one requesting the clearing.\n\nYou probably keep a big snowblower, and you find the narrowest one that fits between bumpers of a parked car etc. The electric snow shovels could be charging in the truck while not in use.\n\nHonestly, if I wasn't an old man, I think I'd do this myself.",

But my new gold standard is putting in a few hours of \"setup\" and then seeing money come for years to come. Literally maybe spending 2 seconds every month on it after set up.\n\nFor me, that gold standard is **OOH (Out-of-Home) Advertising.**\n\nI didn't buy a $100k highway billboard. I went DIY. Here is the breakdown:\n\n* **The Location:** Found a high-traffic intersection and made a deal with the landowner to let me place it there.\n* **The Listing:** Put a \"Your Ad Here\" sign with my number on the bench and listed the space on [**ADVR: Advertising Marketplace**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/advr-advertising-marketplace/id6745561123) (it's an app that connects owners with advertisers).\n* **The Result:** A local tree service company found the listing. They now pay me **$700/year** to have their logo on that bench.\n* **The Profit:** I pay the landowner **$200/year** for the \"rent.\" I net **$500/year** in profit for doing literally nothing once the deal was signed. (not including the $70 it cost for me to create the bench)\n\n**Why this beats other \"passive\" income:**\n\n1. **Low Maintenance:** Once the bench is bolted down and the ad is applied, I spend maybe a 2 second glance checking on it on my way to work.\n2. **Physical Asset:** I own the bench. If the advertiser leaves, the bench stays.\n3. **Scalability:** If I do this 10 times, that’s $5,000/year. If I do it 100 times... you get the math.\n\nIt’s not \"get rich quick.\" It’s \"build something once and get paid for a long time.\" This could then transpire into a billboard.\n\nHere's the proof in the pudding.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qsqmakj7mlhg1.png?width=1042&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd2b2fb5198bdc675c9033d502b11f7fba5bb775\n\n",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nMy name is Nicolas and if you've read my previous posts you know I went from baker to making $1.5M with a WordPress product, then lost most of it because I was young and stupid. Life has been hard but I'm back doing what I love, building products.\n\nToday I want to share something different, not a story about my past, but a business model that's exploding right now and I believe anyone can start with almost no money. I'm talking about selling AI assistants to small businesses.\n\nBefore you click away thinking this is some technical stuff for developers, just keep reading. I'm going to break this down into steps so simple that my kid who never touched code in his life could do it.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding why this works**\n\nEvery day, thousands of small businesses are losing money because they miss phone calls. Think about it, a plumber is under a sink, a dentist is with a patient, a massage therapist is in session. Someone calls, nobody picks up, that potential customer calls the next business on Google and money is lost.\n\nBig companies have receptionists and call centers, small ones don't have that luxury. But now, AI can answer calls, book or cancel appointments, answer questions, and do it 24/7 for a fraction of what a human employee costs. We're talking about something that can save a business thousands of dollars while making them more money by never missing a lead.\n\nThe beauty is you don't need to build the AI yourself. There are platforms that do all the heavy lifting, you just need to set it up and sell the service. You become the person who connects small businesses with technology they don't even know exists.\n\n**Step 2: Finding your first clients (this is where most people fail)**\n\nHere's what nobody tells you about starting a business, the product is rarely the problem. Finding customers is, and with this model, finding customers is actually the easy part if you know where to look.\n\nGo on LinkedIn right now and search for job postings. Look for small businesses hiring receptionists, administrative assistants, or customer service reps. These companies are literally telling you they need help answering phones and managing customer inquiries. They're about to spend like $2000 a month on a salary plus benefits, training, sick days, and vacations. You can offer them an AI solution for a fraction of that price that works nights and weekends without complaining.\n\nDo the same on Indeed or even Google. Search your local area for receptionist positions at dental offices, law firms, real estate agencies, salons. Every single one of these is a potential client who already has a budget allocated for solving the exact problem you're about to solve cheaper and better.\n\nYou can also just drive around your neighborhood. If you see a sign for a local business? Call their number after hours.\n\nIf it goes to voicemail or nobody picks up, that's a potential client. Take note, come back the next day with your pitch.\n\n**Step 3: Creating your demo**\n\nHere's where you separate yourself from all the people who send generic cold emails that get deleted. Before you contact any business, you're going to spend 15 to 30 minutes creating a demo specifically for them.\n\nLet's say you found a dental office called Bright Smiles Dental hiring a receptionist. You set up a quick AI assistant demo that says something like \"Hi, thanks for calling Bright Smiles Dental. I'm here to help you schedule an appointment, answer questions about our services, or connect you with our team. How can I help you today?\"\n\nYou customize it with their business name, their services, their hours, their FAQ and anything you found useful on their website. When you call them, you're not pitching an idea, you're showing them exactly what their customers would experience. That changes everything, it goes from \"let me tell you about this thing\" to \"listen to what I already built for you.\"\n\n**Step 4: Pick up the phone**\n\nI know everyone wants to hide behind emails and LinkedIn messages and with many AI tools these days, it is very easy to get emails and reach people automatically but trust me on this, the phone is your best friend. Cold emails get ignored, but phone calls get answered almost always.\n\nHere's a simple script that works:\n\n\"Hi, this is \\[your name\\], I noticed you're looking to hire a receptionist and I wanted to show you something that might help you saving $XXXX per year. I've set up an AI assistant specifically for your business that can answer calls 24/7, book appointments, and never take a sick day. Can I send you a 30-second demo so you can hear exactly how it would work for your customers?\"\n\nYou will for sure get people who will refuse but most will say yes because you're offering something free and it only takes 30 seconds of their time. Once they hear the demo with their business name, their brain starts imagining the possibilities. That's when you schedule a proper call to close the deal.\n\n**Step 5: Pricing and scaling**\n\nStart simple, charge $100 to $200 per month per client, depending on their volume + a one-time fee for the initial setup. Your costs for the AI platform will be somewhere between $30 to $80 depending on usage and minutes consumed. That leaves you with $50 to $120 profit per client every single month.\n\nGet 10 clients and you're making $500 to $1200 per month in recurring revenue, 30 clients and you're at $1500 to $3600 per month for something that takes you maybe 10 hours a week to maintain. It really depends on YOU to move your ass and get more and more businesses to call.\n\nThe best part is once you set up a client, the work is minimal. Maybe a few hours per month for adjustments and support. This is money that hits your account every single month as long as the client stays happy. And trust me, when a business stops missing calls and starts getting more bookings, they don't cancel.\n\nAs you get better, you can add services like follow-up sequences, review requests, or appointment reminders. Each add-on is another reason for them to stay and another way to increase your monthly revenue per client.\n\n**Why am I sharing this for free?**\n\nEvery time I post something helpful, someone asks what's the catch. There is no catch, I believe the best way to build a community and maybe even find future business partners or customers is to share real value without asking for anything in return.\n\nI've been through enough in my life to know that money comes and goes but the relationships you build and the people you help along the way are what actually matter. Call me idiot if you want but I genuinely believe that when you help others succeed, good things come back to you eventually.\n\nNow I want to hear from you. Has anyone already started something similar? What's stopping you from trying this? Drop your questions in the comments and I'll try to answer everyone.\n\nLet's build something great together 🙌\n\n**EDIT:** For all the haters in the comments, I became a developer 15 years ago because strangers on the internet shared their knowledge for free on YouTube and forums without expecting anything in return. That changed my life, so yeah, I will keep sharing free tips, business ideas, and anything that can help others for as long as I can. Some of you clearly don't understand why someone would do that, and honestly that says more about you than it does about me. To everyone else who appreciated this post, thank you, you're the reason I keep writing 🙏",

Anything with such low barriers to entry, especially if there is a decent profit margin, is going to become saturated fast. \n\nI like the concept. I think it’s worth trying if you’re hurting for extra income, especially if you live in an area with enough SMBs to reach out to locally.

      "selftext": "Long story short, I’ve been lurking here for a while. Started noticing those specific influencers popping up on the feed and realized they were AI. Was skeptical at first, but after seeing the numbers people were posting, figured I'd give it a shot.\n\nIt took about 8 weeks, but just closed the first month over $1,000 (hit $1,400 total). It’s not the crazy numbers some of the big players are making yet, but it’s proof that this actually works. Since I learned a lot from this sub, wanted to share the setup.\n\nThe hardest part was getting the character to look consistent. Most web generators have strict filters so had to shop around. Finally generated about 25 consistent images of the same character before launching. If the face morphs between posts, people notice immediately.\n\nFor traffic, I made accounts for Insta, TikTok, and Reddit. Same pfp, generic bio. Posting 2-3 times a day on IG/TikTok (mostly simple reels using trending audio). Reddit has been the real driver though. Found a few niche subreddits that allow this content and the competition is way lower than IG.\n\nThe biggest learning curve was the platform choice. I originally started on Fanvue because everyone recommended it. It worked fine for getting subs, but realized the fees were eating into the margins way too much.\n\nI decided to test moving the traffic to Stacked recently just to see if the take home would be better. Surprisingly, the traffic converted about the same as Fanvue, but because Stacked has lower fees, I actually kept more of the money. Payouts have been fine so far, no holds or anything.\n\nAnyway, it’s a grind, but hitting that first 4 figure month changed the mindset. Just wanted to share that it is possible if you stick to a schedule.",

          "body": "I'm not sure this would work the same today with the likes of ChatGPT writing things. I've been a salesman since 1984, but never wanted to be. I spent a lot of time coldcalling, telemarketing, and doing direct sales copywriting.\n\nIn 2005, I began selling chess sets and books on ebay and Amazon as a side hustle. I had over 400 different products, but couldn't keep it going due to my job being too busy. I quit that job and moved to Austria in 2015, where it soon became clear that my savings wouldn't last long, so I began doing freelance telemarketing. This became a full-time job, and I used to make around 400 calls a day, either commission only, or low pay with a good bonus.\n\nI got decent money and was looking to set up an agency, however, a guy who was trying to sell sports bags on Amazon got in touch to see if I could rewrite his products as they weren't selling. He'd bought a chess set from me some years before as a gift and liked the description so much that he bought himself one too. I charged him a fiver, rewrote his product and they sold out in six weeks.\n\nCopywriting became my side hustle because more people heard what happened and asked me to do the same. It became clear that I could make more money doing the side hustle than my job, so I put my energy into that. Agencies began to contact me and I was shocked at how much they charged. So I set up an agency with 17 freelancers and we did copywriting, product photography, graphic design, keyword research, and translations. In the first year, 2018, we completed 500 projects. I burned out trying to manage everyone and didn't make much money.\n\nSome of my best clients had been pushing me to manage their ppc advertising, and so I agreed, and ringfenced a small group of customers to work as a solo consultant.\n\nFast forward to 2026, and I'm still managing Amazon PPC for sellers and auditing people's products. I work part time, when I want. I sold 40k of training courses, and have been an advertising mentor for some Amazon software companies. I've trained over 400 students and agency staff.\n\nThis side hustle grew in ways I couldn't imagine.\n\nMy advice would be to learn Google PPC as it is similar and has a much broader, professional audience, than those selling on Amazon, and who are willing to pay more. Good luck.",

Most people spend months watching tutorials just to get one consistent face.\nI’ve spent the last few months engineering a Plug &amp; Play system designed to remove that bottleneck. This is for the person who wants the business results without becoming a full-time software debugger.\n\nThe \"Hands-Off\" Infrastructure includes:\nTotal Installation: I handle the backend software, custom nodes, and environment stability so it doesn't break every update.\n\n100% Face Consistency: A dual-layer IPAdapter and LoRA setup that \"locks\" your model's identity across 100+ generations.\n\nReverse Engineering: A workflow that takes any viral image and turns it into a usable prompt for your model automatically.\n\nThe Agency Stack: Face/Body swapping, SFW/NSFW transitions, and high-fidelity skin texture refiners for professional realism.\n\nWhy this is a \"Side Hustle\" engine:\nIndividuals: Skip the learning phase. Go from zero to generating consistent, high-ticket models in 24 hours.\nAgency Owners: Own your internal infrastructure instead of paying expensive content partners.",

It is not exciting, but it is real money and fully remote. Downside is income ceiling is low.\n\nIf you are open to learning a skill  \nPick one boring but useful skill and go all in for 90 days. Stuff like basic web design (Webflow or WordPress), simple automation with no code tools, short form video editing, or customer support ops. These are not glamorous but people actually pay for them.\n\nFreelancing gets a bad rep, but if you focus on one narrow service instead of “I do everything”, it works. For example, “I edit short videos for coaches” or “I set up email flows for small ecommerce stores”.\n\nIf you want something semi passive later  \nContent plus a service. Use the 3 months to talk about what you are learning, build proof, then sell a small service or digital product. This takes longer, but it compounds.\n\nOne thing I would avoid is hopping between ideas every week. Three months is enough time to either make your first dollars or at least know exactly why something did not work.\n\nIf you want, tell me whether you care more about fast income or long term skill building and I can suggest something more specific.",

How to do it: I use Keyvello for this.\n   - Disclosure: It has a Free Trial/Free Tier available to test.\n   - Use the \"Viral Wisdom\" template. It generates a realistic talking character (like a Monk) that lip-syncs your meditation script automatically.\n\nSince you have 3 months of free time, you could easily build a library of 50+ videos.

I guess the dumb people expect everything from you for free and have no self motivation at all to follow through on your advice. Contrary smart people will be wary here of advice hidden as ads. Ultimately nothing is free that is worth getting/having especially when it comes to making money. Also you are having an agency, probably with a goal to drive sales to there although not your highest priority I guess. Which is totally fine imo, dont get me wrong. Offering genuine advice and positioning yourself as an expert is a great way to build trusting business relationships. Compared to the money gurus that promote get rich quick schemes for a quick buck to sell their lousy digital guides. \n\nI will also leave you my feedback while I am at it: You need to work on your agency’s website. It is all over the place - the colors (mobile menu, no noticeable color palette), different size images, repeated content, low res logo. As a web dev agency your website needs to be top notch. Because from a customer perspective I liked what you offered but seeing your website, how could I ever be sure to receive a good service when your site looks that way already.",

      "selftext": "Here are 9 prompts to help you sift through potential ideas and pick the one that is a potential winner!\n\nPro tip: use GPT or the LLM you know best, so it can leverage your full context and history.\n\n**1)**\n\n    Act as my brutally honest co-founder.\n    I’m overwhelmed with too many business ideas. Your first job is NOT to be nice, it’s to organize them so we can kill most of them later.\n    First, ask me to paste ALL my ideas in one message, even if they’re messy.\n    Then: 1. Turn my brain dump into a clean, numbered list of ideas. 2. For each idea, write: - A 1-sentence description in plain English - Who would pay for it (specific type of customer) - HOW it might make money (1 sentence: subscription, service, product, etc.)\n    Do NOT evaluate them yet. Just organize the chaos so we can judge them ruthlessly later.\n\n**2)**\n\n    Act as a skeptical angel investor.\n    Using the numbered list of my ideas, score each one purely on its REVENUE potential.\n    Create a table where each idea gets a 0–10 score for: - Market demand - Willingness to pay - Pricing power (how high I can realistically charge) - Speed to first $1,000 - Realistic path to sustainable revenue within 12–18 months\n    Then: 1. Add a “Total Score” column and rank ideas from highest to lowest. 2. Briefly justify the score for each idea in 1–2 sentences. 3. Bold the top 3 ideas by total score.\n    Do not sugarcoat anything. If something looks weak, say it clearly.\n\n**3)**\n\n    Act as a ruthless idea executioner.\n    Using the scored list we already created, your job is to aggressively CUT ideas that are unlikely to make real money.\n    For each idea: 1. Give a quick verdict: - “STRONG CONTENDER” (keep) - “MAYBE LATER” - “KILL IT” 2. For every “KILL IT”, give a blunt 1–2 sentence reason focused on MARKET VIABILITY: - tiny market, low pricing power, hard to reach customers, etc.\n    Then: - Show me ONLY the ideas labeled “STRONG CONTENDER” in a short list. - Make sure at least 50–70% of ideas are killed or moved to “maybe later”.\n    Be direct. I care more about building a real business than protecting my feelings.\n\n**4)**\n\n    Act as my brutally honest advisor.\n    Here are my constraints: - Time I can work on this per week: [HOURS PER WEEK] - Money I’m willing to invest upfront: [BUDGET] - My main skills: [LIST SKILLS] - Things I refuse to do (or hate doing): [LIST THINGS]\n    Using ONLY the “STRONG CONTENDER” ideas: 1. For each idea, estimate: - Time to launch a basic MVP (in weeks) - Time to first realistic sale - Startup cost (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH, with a rough range) 2. Note how well my current skills match each idea (GOOD / OK / BAD). 3. Label each idea: - “REALISTIC PATH TO REVENUE FOR YOU” - “POSSIBLE BUT HEAVY LIFT” - “NOT A GOOD FIT WITH YOUR CURRENT REALITY”\n    Sort the list so the best fit ideas for ME are at the top. Don’t be optimistic, be realistic.\n\n**5)**\n\n    Act as a strategic consultant hired to pick my most profitable idea.\n    Using the top 3 “REALISTIC PATH” ideas: For each idea, answer:\n    1. WHO pays? Describe the ideal paying customer in detail.  \n    2. WHY they pay: the painful problem or strong desire (in their own words).  \n    3. HOW I get paid:\n       * What I’m actually selling  \n       * A realistic price point  \n       * How many customers I’d need to get to my revenue goal.  \n    4. MAIN OBSTACLES:\n       * What makes this hard (acquisition, competition, operations, etc.)\n    At the end, tell me which of the 3 has: - The clearest path to revenue - The lowest risk for me personally\n\n**6)**\n\n    Act as a lean startup coach obsessed with real-world proof, not theory.\n    Using my single best idea so far: [DESCRIBE IDEA IN 1 SENTENCE].\n    Design 2–3 fast validation experiments I can run in the next 7–14 days, with almost no budget.\n    For each experiment: 1. Describe the test clearly (e.g., landing page + waitlist, cold DMs, offer post, pre-sell call). 2. Give exact steps: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3… 3. Tell me what to measure (signups, replies, calls booked, pre-sales, etc.). 4. Define clear decision rules: - “If I do X and get Y or more, this is a GREEN LIGHT.” - “If I get less than Y, either pivot or kill the idea.”\n    Focus only on experiments that test: “Can this realistically make money?” Not branding, not logos.\n\n**7)**\n\n    Act as my therapist + business coach with zero filter.\n    I don’t just want a profitable idea, I want one I’ll actually stick with long enough to reach my goals.\n    First, ask me 8–10 questions about: - The type of work that energizes me vs drains me - The people I like / hate working with - How comfortable I am with sales and being visible online - My risk tolerance and stress tolerance - The lifestyle I want in 12–24 months\n    Then, using my top 2–3 ideas: 1. Explain how each idea fits or clashes with my personality and lifestyle. 2. Rate each idea on a “STICK-WITH-IT SCORE” from 0–10. 3. Call out any idea that looks great on paper but would probably make me miserable.\n    End by recommending ONE idea that balances money potential + emotional fit.\n\n**8)**\n\n    Act as my risk–reward analyst.\n    For the ONE idea you recommend I pursue, walk me through 3 scenarios over the next 12–24 months:\n    1. Best case:\n       * Approximate revenue range\n       * What my life and schedule look like\n       * Upside if things go better than expected\n    2. Realistic case:\n       * Approximate revenue range\n       * How many customers / clients that might be\n       * How much work per week\n    3. Worst case:\n       * What happens if it “fails”\n       * Skills I still gain\n       * How I can pivot those skills into another opportunity\n    Be conservative. I want sober expectations, not fantasy.\n\n**9)**\n\n    Act as my execution-obsessed co-founder.\n    Based on everything we’ve done, help me:\n    1. Confirm ONE idea I will commit to for the next 90 days.  \n    2. Outline a 90-day plan with 3 phases:\n       * Days 1–30: Validation &amp; first sale\n       * Days 31–60: Improve the offer &amp; delivery\n       * Days 61–90: Push toward a path that could scale\n    For each phase, include: - 3–5 concrete actions - Weekly targets (e.g., # of outreach messages, calls, offers sent) - Simple metrics that show I’m moving closer to my goals.\n    Finish by giving me the next 3 actions I should take THIS WEEK.",

Dividends need rebalancing, side projects drift and even the low effort stuff punishes you if you completely ignore it. Lately I’ve been more focused on small, boring consistency. Not chasing home runs just stacking things that don’t demand daily attention. A little dividend reinvestment, some automated savings rules and occasionally parking small amounts where the risk is defined. I even mess around with tiny, disciplined bets from time to time, mostly as an exercise in restraint. Did one recently on Bracco while checking lines, set it and walked away, which honestly felt closer to passive than most things I’ve tried.  \n  \n  \nI want to know how others here define passive at this point.

      "selftext": "Before i get started, I’m a student who started looking for passive ways to earn cash around summer last year. I had been running a tiktok page writing and posting short stories with ai images on slideshows and selling guides on my workflow, that was making about $500/month at its peak (summer 2023) but i got burnt out as it was very very hands-on (writing full fledged short stories daily while dealing with essays and deadlines). I decided to do some research and figured faceless YouTube automation was my best bet at making money and keeping it as passive as possible.\n\nI got started on faceless youtube with the long-form reddit stories and within a couple of months i was monetized, had about 1.5k subs, and was making maybe £75–£250 per week. It was good pocket money, and quite passive but the growth totally stagnated. I basically started on reddit stories right at the end of the wave, when it got super oversaturated with no way to stand out.\n\nI started looking for a niche that was high-complexity (so fewer people could copy it) but high-demand. I was scrolling through Zack D Films shorts and had an oh shit momentt and I started wondering if I could recreate his blender 3d style with ai.\n\nI spent a week tinkering, and I actually managed to clank together a workflow that looks surprisingly close. Here’s a quick breakdown of how I did it manually (before I found a way to automate and make it more passive):  \n\n\n**Step 1: Scripting**\n\nI’d go to ChatGPT and use a prompt like:\n\n\\&gt; \"Return me a clean Zack-D-Films style script for short-form content. Keep it under 500 characters. Each line should be a story beat. Cinematic and engaging.\" (truncated prompt)\n\n**Step 2: Visual Prompts**\n\nI’d then ask it to expand those beats into image and video prompts:\n\n\\&gt; \"Expand each story beat into an image prompt and a video prompt. Split into STYLE/CAMERA/SETTING/ACTION. Emphasize dynamic camera motion for video prompts. Non-graphic, no gore.\"\n\n**Step 3: Image and Video generation**\n\nI used replicate (developer api website, it’s pay-per-use, so i wasnt dealing with monthly subscriptions or queues) to make all my images and vids. You can use google studio for images and grok to animate instead if you prefer\n\nI used the nano-banana image model (much cheaper than the pro version) to generate a base image for each story beat.\n\nI’d then take that image and feed it into the seedance-1-lite using the video prompt ChatGPT gave me for that storyboard scene.\n\n**Step 4: Editing**\n\nI’d take those 6–8 clips, throw them into CapCut in order and add a narration from ElevenLabs and sometimes the official Zack D Films background music. If I had some extra time on my hands I'd add some synced subtitles (adding subtitles was the worst part holy shit). All in all it would take me about 2 hours per video and cost about \\~$0.80 per final video\n\n**Results:**\n\nI started a fresh channel (to not introduce context drift to the reddit one) and i aged it for a week. The results were ridiculous, it had taken me about \\~3 months to get my reddit stories channel monetised but the zack d films shorts account hit 4,000 watch hours and was monetised in just over 3 weeks. That was my fastest period of growth and if I had been monetised i did the maths and it wouldve been around \\~$4000-5000 in rpm based on views.\n\n**Step 5: My pivot to automation (passiveness) \\[optional\\]**\n\nThe money was great, but 2 hours of editing per short was not \"passive\" in my eyes. I was starting to burn out like with the tiktok ai stories channel.\n\nWhat prevented me from burning out and actually accelerated my growth was when the tool I was using for Reddit stories on my other channel added a Zack D Films format as per my request (i shared my workflow with the dev who then automated it). It basically automated the entire workflow I described above. I went from spending 2 hours per video to 5 minutes.\n\nNow, I post daily, and the channel is pulling in £1.1k–£1.8k per week. Because almost nobody knows how to make (or more aptly is *actually posting)* this specific style yet, the views are way more stable than the Reddit niche.\n\nThe reason im comfortable sharing all this is because information is never the wedge or gap in this day and age. There's an abundance of resources and information on basically anything, but almost no one will actually go ahead and execute. And if they do they wont stick around long enough for it to matter. Thats why i feel comfortable sharing my workflow like this without worrying it'll saturate my niche, and besides if it does, theres at least 2-3 new niches in the faceless channel space each month, and I always try to start one new channel per month (looking at getting into ai horror story guides). Truly I just want to give back however i can for people looking at legit ways to earn passively.\n\nSome caveats i learned from my time:\n\nLocation Matters: Being in the UK \"nerfs\" my RPM a bit. If you’re in the US, your earnings for the same views would probably be 20-30% higher.  \n  \nDont overthink the ai: there are some AI artifacts, but 80% of viewers on Shorts/tiktok really dont care as i noticed in my comments. Video just has to be engaging with a good hook (retention matters so much)\n\nConsistency: Posting daily is what took me from £300 to £1,000+, automate as soon as you can.\n\nIf you need the full prompts I use or want to see examples of the final videos just leave a comment. If you'd like me to do a write-up on my tiktok page and how I used to funnel viewers to buy the guides i can post that too this week.  \n  \nGood luck with whatever venture you choose fellow passive earner!",

Drop shipping on Etsy works but takes time and you do have to invest some cash into buying ads on the platform. After I made my first 100 sales I didn’t have to rely so much on the ads.

Most people aim for $10k and quit in a month.\n\nTo hit $300/month \"passively\" (or semi-passively), you just need **Traffic + Affiliate Link**.\n\n**The Easiest Path right now:** Faceless TikTok/Shorts. You don't need to be an influencer.\n\n1. **Pick a niche:** (e.g., \"Gadgets,\" \"AI Tools,\" or \"Office Setup\").\n2. **The Math:** You need to sell **10 items** a month (at a $30 commission) to hit your $300 goal.\n3. **The Automation:** Don't edit manually (that's not passive). Use AI tools to generate the videos. I use **Keyvello** to auto-match stock footage to my scripts.\n\nIt takes maybe 20 mins a day to manage. Once the videos are up, they work for you 24/7. It's the most realistic way to hit that extra $300 without learning complex skills like SEO or coding.",

I know there are a bunch out there, but this was the most realest one out there ive seen so far\n\nYou can cash them out to your bank later or trade for gift cards,  \nminimum payout is $25 - but the games you play do pay more than those normal GPT apps (2-3 usd more in avg)\n\nif you are interested and sign up by my referral link, you get $5 headstart and if you can reach a certain quota you can stack that bonus once. and what do i get in return? same as you.\n\ni mostly use the money i get to fund some of my weird hobbies XD\n\nthank you so much!!\n\nPs: yes this is a referral link, its the only way to get the bonus\\^\\^\n\nEDIT: the ref link IS in the LP i created called pocketgrind.com. whenever i post raw link my acc dosent seem to allow comments and i think its due to CQS being low!! thank you for understanding\n\nand yes this benjamin app reff i truely should have mentioned! thats why i made the LP to where i mentioned everything",

      "selftext": "I run two niche blogs (home decor + seasonal content) and was spending 3-4 hours per article between keyword research, writing, formatting, creating images, uploading to WordPress, filling in Yoast fields, and adding FAQ schema.\n\nAfter a while I started building a system to automate the repetitive parts. Not the strategy or editing — just the grunt work: drafting, image generation, SEO meta fields, FAQ markup, and uploading as a draft to WordPress.\n\nSome things I learned along the way:\n\n∙\tAI-generated content still needs human editing. I save everything as drafts and review before publishing.\n\n∙\tAutomating image compression saved me more time than I expected — my page speed scores jumped significantly.\n\n∙\tYoast SEO fields are tedious to fill manually but easy to automate via the REST API.\n\n∙\tBulk creation is a game changer for seasonal content — I can queue 20 topics and let it run overnight.\n\nHappy to share more details about the workflow if anyone’s interested.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nwanted to quickly share of what the last 3 months looked like after launching my first \"proper\" iOS app [Dayzen](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dayzen-visual-time-planner/id6754326173). I built one app before purely as a learning exercise and never tried to make money from it. This time I went all in on actually monetizing. Here's what happened.\n\n**The numbers (3 months in):**\n\n3,500 downloads\n\n$1,500 revenue\n\n1 pride-crushing Reddit roasting\n\nNot life-changing money, but considering I work a 9-5 in B2B, and this is a nights-and-weekends project.. I'll happily take it.\n\n**Lesson 1: People HATE subscriptions for utility apps (and they will tell you)**\n\nI launched with a subscription model because that's what every \"how to monetize your app\" blog tells you to do. Recurring revenue, LTV and all those nice things. What all the indiehacker blogs don't tell you is that regular people  (not SaaS buyers) genuinely *HATE* subscriptions for simple tools.\n\nI posted about my app on Reddit and got absolutely torched. Like, \"my ears were physically hot from embarrassment\" torched. Comments like \"another app wanting $5/month to show me a clock\" levels of brutal.\n\nBut they were right. A planning tool isn't Netflix. People want to pay once and own it. I switched to a lifetime purchase option and conversions improved almost immediately. The lesson: listen to the roasting. Sometimes the mob is correct.\n\n**Lesson 2: B2C marketing is a completely different beast**\n\nI spend my days selling to businesses. In B2B, you can target 50 accounts, write a good cold email, and land meetings. In B2C? You're screaming into a void of millions of people who don't care.\n\nThings that didn't work nearly as well as I expected: paid social ads. Things that worked way better than expected: genuinely participating in communities (ADHD subreddits, productivity forums) and letting the product speak for itself. The irony of B2C is that trying to \"market\" feels like marketing, and people smell it instantly. Being a real human who built something they actually use daily works 10x better.\n\n**Lesson 3: The minimalism vs. feature bloat tightrope is REAL**\n\nEvery week I get two types of feedback:\n\n\"This app needs \\[X feature\\] to be useful\" and \"I love how simple this is\"\n\nBoth people are right. Both people would be furious if I listened to the other one. Designing a consumer app that stays focused while growing is genuinely one of the hardest product challenges I've faced — and I do product for a living.\n\nMy rule now: if a feature serves the *core metaphor* (in my case, visualizing time as a finite container), it gets considered. If it's a \"nice to have\" that dilutes the core experience, it goes in the maybe-later pile. Most things go in the maybe-later pile.\n\n**Lesson 4: Privacy-first sounds great until you need to make decisions**\n\nI deliberately chose to collect zero user data. No analytics, no tracking, no accounts required. And users *love* this. It's one of the most praised things in reviews.\n\nBut here's the thing nobody tells you: when you don't collect data, your own product becomes a black box. I have no idea which features people actually use. I don't know where people drop off. I can't segment users by behavior. Every product decision is basically vibes and App Store reviews.\n\nIt's a trade-off I'd make again. I think it's the right thing to do but \"privacy-first\" has a real cost that the indie dev community romanticizes a bit too much. You're essentially flying blind.\n\n**Lesson 5: The first app you monetize teaches you more than 10 you don't**\n\nMy first app was a learning exercise. I learned Swift, I learned design, I learned shipping. But I learned *nothing* about pricing, positioning, conversion, or retention because there was no money on the line.\n\nThe moment real dollars are involved, your brain works differently. You start thinking about value perception, willingness to pay, trial-to-paid funnels. You read your 1-star reviews at 2am and actually think about what they mean. I wish I'd tried monetizing earlier, even badly.\n\n**What's next:**\n\nHonestly just keep going. $1.5k in 3 months won't pay my rent, but the trajectory feels right. The people who use the app daily are genuinely passionate about it, and that's the signal I'm chasing. I want to build the best visual planning experience on iOS and I think there's a real niche here for people who think in time-blocks rather than lists.\n\nHappy to answer any questions or share more specific numbers. And if you've launched a consumer app from a B2B background, I'd especially love to hear your experience  because I'm still very much figuring this out.\n\nJoris\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1qyl2mr/video/3xjmt022f4ig1/player\n\n",

      "selftext": "I had pretty consistent work for a while between Appen/Crowdgen, RWS, Alignerr... but it seems to have dried up in past couple of months. Remotasks flagged my account over a year ago for something super stupid (I accidentally also made an Outlier account during transition). I had a task for Stellar AI about a year, but after getting approved to work on it, I didn't do it because I had so many other projects going on, and I think I got blacklisted. Appen/Crowdgen has been dead for like 6 months for me. I was approved for their Multimango, but it seems they lost it. Was approved for another project, but it only ever says tasks are not available. I am in Multimango for RWS, but am on hold during audit review... and the other task I am on in Alignerr is waiting for new data. I am passing the time with crappy Prolific surveys, but I feel like I need something else. I have applied to a few Mercor positions, Telus positions, and Oneforma never pays enough... any other suggestions? I am more of a generalist with rating/auditing/reviewing experience with transcriptions, audio, and visual. I have a biology degree, but honestly, it has been like 20 years since earning it, and I don't remember half of what I learned, though it does come in helpful as just having it allows me to do Pearson scoring in the spring.\n\nWhere else should I be looking?",

I know that any policy/NDA/etc breach could result in the termination of my accounts and participation in each of the related projects, additionally getting me blacklisted by both companies.

      "selftext": "**Note**: *Not promoting this side project - its not relevant for people, only the lessons are. I blurred the name and details out for this reason.*\n\n\\---\n\n3 years ago I built a simple site for college students looking for off-campus housing for a specific area. Put it up, ported the data from an old Excel sheet the students used, sent an email blast to the landlords on the Excel doc, and largely stopped working on it after 1 month. It currently makes about $1k/year from subscriptions, and I'm going to be adding minimal ads soon. I check on it maybe once a quarter or when someone emails me.\n\nWell, I get weekly emails from Google Search Console, and the stats, impressions, etc. just keep climbing. And now? **I'm ranking above Zillow for hundreds of specific address searches.**\n\nNot \"apartments for rent\" or \"houses in Connecticut\", but for queries like \"123 Example Road\" - where students, summer renters, buyers, etc. are googling specific houses near campus or in that area.\n\n# The numbers (last 3 months)\n\n|Metric|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Clicks from Google|1,387|\n|Impressions|17,879|\n|Average position|5.5|\n|Indexed pages|23 (going to add more)|\n\nFor address-specific searches, I'm often **position 2-4**. Zillow is below me. Sometimes I even beat [Realtor.com](http://Realtor.com) too.\n\nOne query specifically: \"919 &lt;REDACTED&gt; road\" - I rank #3, Zillow ranks #4. My CTR on that term is 24%.\n\n# Why does a tiny site beat a $7B company?\n\nZillow optimizes for \"apartments for rent in \\[city\\].\" They care about volume.\n\nI accidentally optimized for \"919 &lt;REDACTED&gt; Road\" - the exact thing a college junior types when they're deciding between two houses for senior year.\n\n**Giants optimize for scale. Niches get ignored.**\n\n# The playbook I stumbled into\n\n**1. Hyper-specific pages**\n\nI have a dedicated page for each paid listing with the exact address in the URL, title, and H1. Zillow buries the same info 2-3 clicks deep in a generic template.  Side note: The SEO alone is nearly worth the subscription costs for the landlords.\n\n**2. Intent matching**\n\nMy page says \"student rental\" and \"summer rental\" and shows what students and summer renters actually care about: bedrooms, distance to campus, landlord contact.\n\nZillow shows Zestimate, tax history, and mortgage calculators. Wrong intent entirely.\n\n**3. Long-tail by default**\n\nI never targeted \"&lt;CITY&gt; rentals\" (impossible to rank). I target things like \"&lt;X&gt; university beach houses\" - lower volume, zero competition, high intent.\n\n**4. Passive maintenance**\n\nLandlords update their own listings - I just keep the lights on. Total time spent per month: maybe 1 hour for specific requests, or editing/approving new listings.\n\n# This pattern works everywhere\n\nThe model isn't unique to housing. Any time there's a giant who doesn't care about a specific user segment, there's an opportunity:\n\n|Niche Site|Beats|Why It Works|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Local activity blogs (e.g., \"Things to do in Lake Winnipesaukee\")|TripAdvisor, Yelp|Hyper-local content, updated seasonally, ad revenue|\n|College-specific resources|Generic education sites|Students search \"\\[university name\\] + thing\" not \"college thing\"|\n|Hobby part suppliers|Amazon, eBay|\"1967 Omega Seamaster crown\" - Amazon doesn't index this|\n|Local service directories|Thumbtack, Angi|\"Best plumber in \\[small town\\]\" - nationals don't optimize for 5k population towns|\n\nThe common thread: **specificity beats scale when the user's intent is specific.**\n\n# What I'd do if starting today\n\n1. **Find a market where giants exist but don't care about your user**\n   * Zillow doesn't care about college students at specific addresses\n   * Booking.com doesn't care about dog-friendly cabins at one specific lake\n   * Amazon doesn't care about vintage watch parts\n2. **Build pages that match exact search intent**\n   * If someone searches an address, give them an address page\n   * If someone searches \"\\[school\\] housing,\" give them a school page\n3. **Let the content maintain itself**\n   * User-generated listings, community contributions, or scraping public data\n   * Your job is curation, not creation\n4. **Monetize through ads or affiliate**\n   * These sites don't need subscriptions\n   * Traffic + local ads = passive income\n   * My site makes \\~$1k/year on basically zero effort\n5. **Be patient**\n   * Keep your costs low - these things take time.\n\n**Monetize through subscriptions, local ads or affiliate**\n\n# Final Note\n\nAt this point, the SEO and potential local business ad revenue (e.g. $20-100/mo for side ad placements) likely exceeds the annual subscription value. Someone may very easily pay $5k+ to acquire the site.  It was extremely easy to set up, I posted a few bulletins on the schools Housing Board, and emailed everyone I knew who had a rental house. Many were quick to pay the $100/yr subscription - I probably can charge more.\n\n*Funny final anecdote*: *The mayor of a large city nearby has 2 paid listings on the site, so we are on a first name basis and I have his number and email - maybe it'll come in handy one day!*",

I only made 3 sales of the desktop app $75). Plus, Mediavine ads are down as well due to it being Q1, earning me around $110 in the last 30 days.\n\nRight now, 99% of my time is spend on our startup Genviral and newly launched iOS app, so there isn't much I can do but hope that the search engine gods start liking me again. \n\nI did ship some additional features to the terrific tools desktop app when I got Claude Code and the Max subscription. \n\nHonestly having tons of fun working on the desktop app and it has morphed into something really useful. Just need to do a better job of advertising it, which I'll focus on once our startup and app don't require as much active involvement from my end. \n\nFinally, the site was also down yesterday as I finally hit the free Vercel tier. Currently migrating the project over to my own dedicated VPS (Hetzner) hosted via Coolify. \n\nLet's hope the next update is going to be a more positive one :)",

It was frustrating.\n\n**What I built:**\n\nAffiliateVault - a searchable directory with:\n\n* 2,600+ vetted affiliate programs\n* 60 categories (AI, business, finance, SaaS, etc.)\n* 8 product types (physical, digital, services, etc.)\n* Commission rates, cookie duration, and affiliate links\n* Search and filter functionality\n* Bookmark feature\n\n**The process:**\n\n* Spent a few hours every day gathering programs from various sources\n* Manually vetted each one (checked if links work, verified commission info)\n* Built the structure and database\n* Created search/filter system\n\n**What I learned:**\n\n1. Most \"affiliate program lists\" are complete garbage - outdated, spammy, or pure SEO bait\n2. A shocking number of programs have terrible affiliate terms (7-day cookies, low commissions)\n3. The best programs are often hidden and not marketed well\n4. People desperately need a centralized resource for this\n\n**Current state:**\n\nLaunched a few days ago with lifetime access pricing. Getting some traction but still testing different marketing angles.\n\n**Loom walkthrough (2 min):** [https://www.loom.com/share/03d1c90737214f5e8b996c5caf5adecd](https://www.loom.com/share/03d1c90737214f5e8b996c5caf5adecd)\n\n**Link:** [www.affiliatevault.online](http://www.affiliatevault.online)\n\nHappy to answer questions about the build process, monetization strategy, or anything else!",

Think old-school directories, but cleaner and searchable.\n\nThe issue is that I have traffic but no **revenue** right now.\n\nI don’t really want to use AdSense.  \nNot because of earnings only, but because:  \n• approval is annoying  \n• I’ve seen accounts randomly banned  \n• Ads don’t match directory users very well  \n• It makes the site look spammy\n\nWhat I’m trying to find is something more “integrated”.\n\nWhat I mean:  \nIdeally, I’d like a monetisation method where I can **add a code/script to my site** that automatically displays relevant content (listings, offers, tools, widgets, etc.) instead of traditional banner ads.\n\nBasically:  \nnot popups  \nnot gambling ads  \nnot shady downloads\n\nMore like:  \n— contextual marketplace  \n— sponsored listings  \n— useful widgets  \n— something that fits a directory\n\nI already thought about:  \n• paid submissions  \n• featured listings\n\nBut I feel I’m missing something smarter that other directory owners use.\n\nSo my question to people who run sites:  \n**What monetisation methods actually worked for you on informational or directory websites that are NOT AdSense?**\n\nEspecially if it’s something that can be installed via a code snippet or a widget.\n\nI’m open to anything — affiliate networks, APIs, widgets, SaaS partnerships, etc.\n\nWould really appreciate real experiences rather than theory.\n\nThanks 🙏",

          "body": "This is smart but the real unlock nobody in this thread is talking about: do this for customer calls, not just investor pitches.\n\nI spent months optimizing my investor pitch. Got great at it. Raised money. Then realized I had no idea how to sell the actual product to actual customers because I had never studied them with the same intensity.\n\nThe investor pitch is a one-time performance. Customer conversations happen every single day and they compound. Every customer call you walk into unprepared is revenue you left on the table.\n\nWhat I do now before every important customer call: I pull their LinkedIn, their company blog, their recent job postings (tells you what they are investing in), their Glassdoor reviews (tells you what is broken internally), and any podcast appearances. Feed it to Claude and ask it to roleplay as this person pushing back on my product.\n\nThe job postings thing is the real cheat code nobody talks about. If a company is hiring for a role related to what you sell, they have already decided to invest in solving that problem. You are not convincing them they have a problem. You are convincing them your solution is better than hiring someone.\n\nOne customer call where I did this prep resulted in a 6-figure annual contract. They literally said \"it feels like you understand our business better than most people who work here.\" I did. Because I spent 2 hours studying them like they were a final exam.\n\nThe meta lesson: preparation is the most underrated competitive advantage in business. Most people wing it. The ones who don't, win disproportionately.",

It was a small B2C SaaS that was already making around **$500/month**. Nothing crazy as such, but it was real revenue.\n\nAnd that I exited at 6 figures.\n\nSince then, I’ve bought **5 more businesses**, all for **under $10k**, and every one of them was already making money when I bought it.\n\nI don’t come from a finance background. I wasn’t rich. I just spent time looking for small deals most people ignore.\n\nOne big reason I prefer buying instead of starting from scratch:  \nyou’re not guessing if the idea will work.\n\nThe business already exists. Customers are already paying. There’s way less uncertainty compared to starting something new where you’re testing everything from zero.\n\nIf a bought business doesn’t work out, you usually still have options - improve it, fix obvious issues, or even sell it again. That feels way less risky to me than pouring months (or years) into something that may never make a dollar.\n\nEven while writing this, I can see **dozens of small businesses with revenue** selling for just a few thousand dollars.\n\nWhat actually matters isn’t being rich or “qualified.” It’s more about finding decent deals, being willing to take action (Execution is really imp), negotiating the right price and keep on iterating once you own it, etc. \n\nThere are a lot of businesses out there where **you’d be a better operator than the current owner**.",

Buying an existing business is often the lowest-risk path, especially in AI/SaaS.\n\nFor our own projects (and potentially for due diligence before acquisition), we use an internal tool that checks how different LLMs (Claude, Grok, Perplexity) categorize a company: labels, associations, biases, gaps in perception.\n\nIt helps understand why traffic &amp; leads might not convert even with good numbers on paper. In 2026, this is already critical - the decision is often made based on the AIs response before even visiting the website.\n\nHas anyone had experience where the AI's perception of a business significantly impacted post-acquisition growth?",

Bots everywhere, on every platform, and you can’t tell anymore because they all sound like that one overachieving kid in class who read the textbook twice.\n\nMedieval doctors wore bird masks and prescribed leeches. We have AI detection tools that are wrong half the time. Same energy honestly.\n\nThe plague ended when the rats ran out of people to infect. This one ends when AI runs out of human content to train on and starts eating its own output. We’re watching the internet develop mad cow disease in real time.",

So we went dark for 8 months and built.\n\nNo blog. No social media. No talking to potential customers. Just heads down building because I was convinced someone would steal the idea if we talked about it. Looking back thats embarrassing to admit but at the time it felt like strategy.\n\nWe launched to nothing. Not criticism. Not rejection. Just silence. The kind of silence where you refresh your analytics dashboard 40 times a day and the number stays at zero. My co-founder and I sat in a coffee shop the day after launch staring at each other like \"now what.\"\n\nThe product wasnt bad. We actually got decent feedback from the few people who tried it. The problem was that nobody knew we existed and we had zero relationships with the people we were building for. Eight months of building and we hadnt talked to a single potential customer.\n\nHeres what I do completely differently now:\n\nI dont build anything until Ive talked to at least 30 people who have the problem Im trying to solve. Not surveys. Actual conversations. Most of them will tell you things that make you uncomfortable. Thats the point.\n\nI build in public now. Not in the cringey \"day 47 of my startup journey\" way. But I talk about what Im working on, what problems Im seeing, what Im learning. The people who engage with that become your first users.\n\nI stopped being precious about the idea. Nobody is going to steal your startup idea. Execution is everything and most people cant even execute on their own ideas let alone yours.\n\nThe stealth mode thing felt like strategy but it was actually fear. I was afraid of putting something imperfect out there. I was afraid of hearing that maybe the thing I was building didnt matter. Stealth mode is just expensive procrastination disguised as strategy.\n\nIf you are reading this and you are currently in stealth mode, stop. Go talk to 10 people this week about what you are building. The discomfort you feel doing that is the exact work you are avoiding.",

Freelancing pays the bills but eats my time. SaaS needs time but doesn't pay yet. I can't go all-in on SaaS without the income. I can't grow the income without going all-in.\n\nFor those who made the switch from services to product, how did you actually do it?\n\nDid you reduce client work gradually? Save up a runway and quit? Keep both running until the product caught up?\n\nI also have a family, mortgage, the whole thing. \n\nWhat's realistic here?

Replacing $20k/mo in year one is possible but statistically rare unless you already have distribution or you’re selling a high-ACV B2B product where a handful of customers gets you there.\n\n\n\nWhat I’ve seen work with family/mortgage is: don’t quit, but aggressively reshape consulting. Raise rates, move to retainers, cut scope, and aim for 2 to 3 “good” clients max so you can buy back 10 to 15 hours a week consistently. Then treat SaaS like a pipeline with weekly output targets (customer calls, outbound, content, partnerships), because the real bottleneck usually isn’t building, it’s distribution.\n\n\n\nAlso, don’t “kill” the SaaS based on time, kill it based on signals: if you can’t find a niche that feels acute pain, can’t get people to pay, or churn stays ugly after you’ve iterated with real users. Four months is basically still the learn-what-to-sell phase, so the more realistic question is whether you can get to meaningful revenue in 12 to 24 months while consulting less, not whether you can fully replace $20k by December.",

And the people in my field that do hire people to try to scale, it doesn't go as planned. Ends up just being more stress and responsibility for basically no more income.\n\nBecause of this, I too tried various other things that potentially could scale. Including building my own software.\n\nBasically, nothing else I have tried has made me any money other than me providing my service. And i've tried a lot of things.\n\nAs a result, I am a big fan of building your next move, on the side. Keep your day gig going. It takes a lot of the pressure off. And in the entrepreneurial business, your new venture is much more likely not to succeed than it is to succeed. What would that mean to your finances? For me, it would really really really suck. So I am working on those other ideas on the side.\n\nOne piece of advice I learned to late is, don't build until you have validated that people actually want to buy. Not just interest, not just a clear demand, but people actively trying to part ways with their money for the thing you would build. That's key. Otherwise you will fall into the trap that so many of us fell into. Building something not enough people want. Or, that they do want, just not from you. Or whatever reason people ultimately don't buy. Know that ahead of time.\n\nYes, I think you are being naive thinking you can replace $20K/month in 5 years, let alone 1 year. OF course it's possible.

But you're missing the part where if you stop looking at the path of others there is a great path to scaling for a services companies that isn't explored much. Actually, that's my focus right now.\n\nBut in your shoes, you should first try to get fixed price contracts. It will help you get exact clarity on the value you're providing and what you want to do. From there you'll also own any value from any improvements to your processes and IP that you implement. From there focus on creating IP to make yourself faster. Even consider hirin someone to help you. Technically you're still needed but in the process you are productizing your consulting work. Your knowledge and skill is getting documented in your IP. It alo means you can get a lot more value from a junior implementor.\n\nIP that helps you work faster is just as much valid IP as IP that you sell directly to customers.

Too risky.\n\nAlso consider: your SaaS doesn't need to replace 21k. It needs to replace your minimum viable lifestyle. What's the actual number where you're fine, not comfortable but fine? That's your real target.\n\n4 months is nothing for SaaS. Most take 18 to 24 months to get real traction. The ones that blow up fast are survivorship bias.\n\nDon't kill it yet.

I spent a lot of time figuring out what features my users really needed versus what I thought they needed, which can be a game changer for product-market fit.\n\nAlso, consider leveraging the feedback loop from your early users.

Started as 100% consulting in something I had direct experience in, and I slowly started building a product, starting end of year 1. I couldn’t build a product to replace what I did exactly, but I could build one to supplement the services I offered.\n\nI would do the normal contracts, then see if I could sell the product to solve a small but recurring pain point. It was a small problem to solve, but necessary, so while the subscription revenue was small it wasn’t too hard a sell.\n\nI found it was more important to get my foot in the door as a SaaS vendor than to worry about the money. Because, over time, the product features grew and I already had the relationship. Upselling is often much easier than new sales. \n\nProduct development started to turbo charge early last year, thanks to LLMs, while development cost flat lined or even shrunk. It was difficult to find time to code when I had high paying billable work, so it happened in spurts throughout the year during otherwise slower periods. \n\nI did have an employee who both consulted and coded, they were an entry level hire so while it took a lot of time to train them, they weren’t too expensive while having low utilization. I too had projects only I could do, for whatever reason, so I had to win new, smaller ones, for him. While he certainly helped move the product along, 4 years and many raises in, he was mostly break even and started to under perform, resulting in him being let go. \n\nI hired a part time engineer and an in house accountant-trained-consultant, both off shore. Engineer was good, though financially questionable decision given SaaS revenue. Accountant/Consultant was the best decision I ever made. \n\nUltimately picked up most of the development myself as my employee gained enough experience to replace me on 60% of work. \n\nThe consulting we do, while still majority of revenue, has fully transitioned to consulting on an area of past experience, to 100% on our own product about 3-4 years in. Great for sticky customers and flexible staffing. By year 4 or 5 it all felt stable. \n\nLong story short, diversify customer base and hire / train. Cut back on expenses and re-invest as much as you can into training and product dev. It’s risky, especially if someone you train for a year leaves, or turns out to be a bad fit, but it works. Plan in terms of 3,5,7,10 year milestones, and don’t expect big results in weeks or months. \n\nAt least, this was my experience 🤷🏻‍♂️",

          "body": "While I don't have one concrete answer for your questions, what I believe would help you is breaking down you situation/problem and try solving it part by part. You ask a few different (and some contradictory) questions. So I'll try to do that and challenge some of your statements (feel free to react/challenge/reject anything that doesn't make sense to you).\n\nFirst, you say \"it doesn't scale\". My question to you: why do you want to scale? It may sound like a \"duh\" question but I genuinely wonder where that comes from (you want a different lifestyle, you want more money, you think it that's the logical next step -- what's your personal reason/need behind it? What is truly pressing you?). I seems it's because \"freelancing pays the bills but eats my time\". and you'd like your income not to depend on the hours you work (fair enough). But how would you like to spend the hours you save? Or are you happy to work same or more hours, but you want to scale your income overall?\n\nSecond, besides \"replacing your income by the end of the year\", were there any other reasons you launched the SaaS? Is it a passion of your, or maybe you saw a unique opportunity? Did you perhaps see yourself enjoying the new challenge or did it validate your expertise in a certain way? (Just a few examples). When building is slow, it helps to reconnect with the internal motivation (not just external e.g., I want this to solve my income scalability)\n\nNow the core part: you say \"My goal was to replace freelance income by end of this year.\" and \"I'm impatient\", and \"I'm nowhere close.\" after a few months. This signals to me that there's a certain degree of inflexibility in how you're approaching your situation likely because (bear with me) you have beliefs that clash with reality. I'm seeing that a lot in my own business journey too. What has helped me is adjust my expectations and beliefs of \"this must be done in x way, by x time\". I wonder if this resonates with you.\n\nNet, I sense you're stuck in a binary thinking of \"I must either go all in on the SaaS (but I cannot because I need the money from freelancing) or kill the SaaS, so which one is it?\". In reality, there are always more than 2 options but sometimes it is hard to see them. What makes these the only two options in your mind now? What other (interim) solutions could be possible? If your friend was in this situation, what opportunities would you see for them?\n\nFor example, you say \"I want to scale, I need to hire, and where I'm based, that's not an option right now\"- I wonder if this is fully true. If employing someone is truly a solution, then there could be location-independent ways to get some external help. Perhaps you'd need to compromise your profits for a certain time but you'd gain time to invest in the SaaS or elsewhere. It depends on what is the minimum income you'd need to be stable and what part you can give up temporarily.\n\nRight now, it sounds like you are actually in a fractional employment role. You're building a product so you'd diversify your income (which is smart). I'm a strong advocate for \"portfolio careers\" where income comes from a combination of freelancing, consulting, a digital product, a course/book, and a fractional role.\n\nPerhaps what you need to solve right now is not how to move from fractional role to SaaS business but how to keep both running without burning yourself out?",

You build real runway instead of hoping SaaS catches. Choice #2 is emotionally harder but potentially more valuable.\n\n\n\nYou can't do both. The attempt to do both is what's destroying you.",

Here's what actually worked:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The uncomfortable truth first:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nYou probably won't replace $20k/month SaaS income in year one. The realistic path is more like: maintain consulting income as long as possible while building product leverage, then gradually shift the ratio as the product proves itself.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What the successful transitions I've seen look like:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Don't quit consulting - productize parts of it first\\*\\*\n\n   \\- What repetitive deliverables do you give clients? Can any become templates, tools, or automated solutions?\n\n   \\- Your existing clients are your first potential SaaS customers or at minimum your beta testers\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*The \"runway\" question is the wrong frame\\*\\*\n\n   \\- Instead of \"save X months then go all-in,\" think \"reduce consulting hours by 20% when SaaS hits $2k MRR, then by another 20% at $5k MRR\"\n\n   \\- This gives you feedback loops instead of a cliff\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Kill criteria for the SaaS:\\*\\*\n\n   \\- If after 6 months of consistent effort you have &lt; $1k MRR and flat/declining growth, that's a pivot signal\n\n   \\- But \"4 months and nowhere close\" might just mean you haven't found distribution yet. SaaS growth usually doesn't start until month 6-12\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Specific tactics:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*Raise your consulting rates by 20-30%\\*\\*: Either clients pay more (giving you more runway per hour worked) or some leave (freeing up time). Win either way.\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*Shift to retainer-only consulting\\*\\*: Project work is unpredictable. Retainers give you predictable income AND time blocks.\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*One day per week non-negotiable\\*\\*: Protect SaaS time like a client meeting. If you don't, consulting will always eat it.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The family factor:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nWith mortgage and family, the \"quit and figure it out\" stories aren't your playbook. The boring answer is: you do both, longer than feels comfortable, until the SaaS can actually support you. Usually 18-24 months, not 12.\n\n\n\nWhat does your SaaS do, and what's your current MRR/user count after 4 months?",

I honestly think the 20 years spent working a corporate job was vital to that success.  It gave me the opportunity to truly understand the industry from a lot of angles.\n\nAt the same time, I decided about 5 years in that owning my own business was the end goal.  That gave me 15 years to plan and save so that I was able to start out without partners, investors, or loans.  That was key to my ability to be competitive with more established businesses right out of the gate.  If I had started out in my 20s it would have been much harder.\n\nIn my experience, there are a lot of things that might cause you to fail at being a successful business owner.

Thats it. Everything else favors you. You have context for real problems. You have savings (or at least a credit history). You have professional relationships. You know how businesses actually operate from the inside.\n\nMy first company flopped. Built it in stealth for 8 months because I was paranoid someone would steal the idea. Nobody cared.

          "body": "I’m really sorry you’re going through this. What you’re describing isn’t laziness or failure it’s what happens when multiple things collapse at once: layoffs, a brutal job market, bias, and rising costs. That combination breaks even very capable people.\n\nA lot of people don’t realize how bad things are right now. Many jobs are posted without real intent to hire, freelance work is oversaturated, and ghosting has become normal. On top of that, bias against people from certain regions is real, even if no one says it out loud. None of that reflects your skills or work ethic.\n\nYou’re also not “begging” for work you’re trying to survive. There’s no shame in that. The problem isn’t that you’re asking; it’s that desperation in a broken market often goes unanswered, no matter how qualified someone is.\n\nOne thing that might help is narrowing your offer drastically. Instead of “we do digital marketing, social media, automation,” try one very specific outcome for one specific type of client. Broad services feel risky to clients right now; narrow, concrete help feels safer.\n\nIf you need to take temporary, underpaid, or unpleasant work just to keep the lights on, that doesn’t mean you’ve failed it means you’re buying time. Survival comes before pride. This season does not define you.\n\nLastly, please don’t internalize the judgment from others. People who haven’t been here often believe hardship only happens to those who “did something wrong.” That belief protects them emotionally, but it isn’t true.\n\nYou’re not broken. You’re exhausted, under pressure, and navigating a system that’s failing a lot of people quietly. Keep going one step at a time, and if possible, accept help without shame when it’s offered. Wanting to work and contribute already says everything about you.",

Unless your service is a highly specialised niche service, clients will opt to work with people in countries with similar legal/compliance standards.\n\nI wouldn’t frame this issue as one of racism but more of an issue of risk tolerance for legal issues.

This happened when they figured out what the top five types of tickets were. They fixed those problems at the start. They made the details of the promotions let people track their own orders and sent automatic replies to common questions. So a lot of issues did not even get to the support team. This was a help, with the top five ticket types.\n\nI am also curious to know when most tickets come in. Do most tickets come in before people make a purchase or do they come in right after someone places an order?. Do most tickets come in when there are problems with delivery?

The ghosting pattern you describe is unfortunately common in freelance services, especially when competing globally.\n\nA few things that helped us break through similar walls:\n\n1. Niche down hard. Not \"digital marketing\" but \"LinkedIn content for B2B SaaS founders\". Specificity signals expertise.\n\n2. Show the work upfront. Create case studies, loom videos, or free audits that prove competence before the call. Trust is built before the meeting, not during.\n\n3. Target companies that already hire remote/international talent. Look for \"async-first\" or \"distributed team\" in their job posts.\n\n4. LinkedIn outreach with warmth. We built a tool (ReactIn) specifically because cold outreach was painful. The key is engaging with their content first, then reaching out. Not the other way around.\n\nThe market is hard, but 300/month is achievable with the right positioning. Dont give up. The first yes will change everything.",

It sounds like bad timing mixed with a tough market and a lot of pressure all at once.\n\nOne honest thing that might be hurting you right now is offering too many services at once. When people are scared to spend, “digital marketing + social + automation” feels vague to buyers, even if the skills are real. They usually trust one very specific outcome more than a general offer.\n\n  \nA few practical resets that might help, not quick fixes but clearer steps:\n\n\\- Try selling one small, very specific result instead of services. Something boring but concrete.\n\n\\- Avoid monthly retainers for now. They are hard to close when trust is low. One-time, fixed work is easier.\n\n\\- Show your thinking publicly before asking for money. Short Loom audits, breakdowns, examples of how you’d approach a problem.\n\n\\- Taking underpaid or survival work right now is not a failure. It’s just getting through a hard phase.  \n\n\nAbout “begging for work”, asking for work is not begging. It only feels like begging when the offer isn’t clear, both to you and to the buyer.\n\nYou don’t sound incapable or dishonest. You sound stuck in a market that is brutal to generalists right now. Narrowing what you sell and who you sell it to usually brings back some control.\n\nI really hope things stabilize for you soon. What you’re dealing with is harder than most people online admit.",

          "body": "Hey guys, freelance UK marketer and solo agency owner here, really sorry to hear how hard it's been, the economy has been beyond brutal.  Wishing you the best and hope things get better for you soon.\n\nI've utilised marketing contractors and agencies from all over the world during my 10 years or so doing this, both solo and on behalf of clients. Here are some things that I think would help you:\n\n- Website, make one. Seriously. I won't hire any freelancers without a portfolio or website. Even an Upwork profile with some portfolio pieces and feedback, or a simple Wix with some links will do. If I can't see evidence of some work somewhere, I don't trust you - this rule applies to anyone I screen regardless of location.\n\n- I sell a lot of services, but I pitch one thing as an opener. For example, first website I made started as a graphic design and content creation project, first PR retainer started with a website copy overhaul, first strategy consultation as copywriting etc. \n\n- As such, don't pitch for retainers, do one project really well, then open up subtly about other services. I learnt this selling for marketing agencies before I went solo. You need to prove trust as a small company with some wins before the client invests. Pick the 3 things you're best at and proven in as your opener.\n\n- Niche down in industry. I offer a lot of services through my own skills and subcontractors, but I'm in a tech niche that I have a network and 10+ years experience in. If you don't have one, find something underserved with less competition. No one wants general services anymore, you either specialise in a few or run lots in specific verticals like luxury, D2C, local businesses, AI, games, telecoms, SaaS etc\n\n- You're understandably scared and I can read it in your text, no offense. Potential clients smell fear a mile away. It's a confidence game. Find something, even part-time or low paid, to keep you afloat. Building a business is very hard with no safety net - been there many times in my career and it sucks. Truly. \n\nBusiness always improved, ironically, when I felt good in of myself and sometimes when I was doing a low-paid job and felt some financial relief. Get some rest, make some time for hobbies, animals and friends, you're both working hard and deserve it 💜",

But I want to share something that might help reframe what's happening.\n\nI went through a period where I couldn't land a single client for 4 months. Not because I was bad at what I did, but because I was selling the wrong thing to the wrong people in the wrong way. I kept pitching \"digital marketing services\" which is what every freelancer on the planet offers. There was nothing for a prospect to grab onto.\n\nWhat changed everything was getting brutally specific. Instead of \"we do digital marketing,\" I started saying \"I'll set up your abandoned cart email sequence and you'll recover 5-15% of lost sales within 2 weeks.\" Same skills. Same me. Completely different response rate.\n\nThe painful truth about service businesses is that \"a range of services from digital marketing social media to automation\" sounds like everything and nothing at the same time. When a client reads that, they think \"this person does a bit of everything\" which translates to \"this person isn't the expert I need for my specific problem.\"\n\nPick the ONE thing you're best at. Not the 5 things you can do. The ONE thing. Then find the specific type of business that desperately needs that one thing and can't do it themselves.\n\nAlso - and I say this with zero judgment because I've been there - when you're desperate, prospects can feel it. It changes the energy of every interaction. The meetings where I finally closed were the ones where I genuinely stopped caring whether they said yes because I'd accepted that I'd survive either way. That mental shift is almost impossible to fake but it's the difference between \"please hire us\" energy and \"here's what I can do for you, take it or leave it\" energy.\n\nYou're not failing because you're from Africa or because you lack skills. You're failing because the positioning is too broad and the desperation is leaking through. Both of those are fixable.",

Many clients are scared, overwhelmed, and choose to ghost instead of saying no.\n\nSecond, desperation is understandable, but it changes how offers are perceived. When survival pressure is high, it helps to narrow focus, not widen it. One clear service, one clear outcome, one proof-driven pitch works better than offering “everything”.\n\nThird, begging will not fix a trust problem. Structure will. Milestone-based work, trials, or agency partnerships reduce risk for clients without reducing your dignity.\n\nYou need fewer doors, better chosen, and walked through calmly.",

It really is a journey, not a destination. There's no biological clock ticking here.\n\nYou have to understand with business.You must bring value to the marketplace.Because it doesn't give a shit about your wants or needs.It will only reward value if you survive.\n\nThere's a reason most successful business owners are in their forties.\n\nYou're a baby on the timeline.\n\nDisregard the do what you're passionate about bullshit.\nDon't look for shortcuts.Because the secret is buried in the work that everyone's trying to avoid always take the hard path. It pays the best in the long run.\n\nHere's what you need.\n\nSkills \nKnowledge \nExperience \nCharacter \nTime\n\nThe good news is, you can get all of those things from just about any job in the world. Even multiple jobs if you bounce around. Any job that can make payroll consistently is further ahead than most small businesses. They've already survived the cut.\n\nI recommend sales. Even if and even if you're an introvert like me.And if you suck at it, because you suck at everything you start at. Anyone can do it. There's also no limit on how much you can make or learn or grow.\n\nWhatever job you get, whatever industry you work in.Because you have to pay your bills. You're gonna spend more time there than you will with those that you love or the things that you love.That's life it's unfair and nobody's coming to save you.\n\nSo be the best at your job, even if it means you're not getting paid for it be better than that. I treated every job like I owned the company. Then, when you're not at work, work harder on yourself than you do your job.\n\nYou have to understand to run a business in the early years.You're doing everything by yourself.With no capital and very little time. You need to be able to do the sales, the order fulfillment, the purchasing, the marketing, the managing, the finances and quickbooks, and the hiring and firing.\n\nLearn every one of those roles at whatever company you're at, by just being curious, which is a skill set.And helpful. The people that are employed that say, well, that's not my job.Or I don't get paid enough to do that.Those are the unhelpful fucking people and they don't learn shit.\n\nDon't be that guy.\n\nSpend ten years building you while paying your bills. Listen to biographies on founder's podcast, all of them over and over again. You will learn so much more at different times of your life.From biographies than you will from any other business book that i've read.And i've got a fucking library like literally a library, and we're building a library in the town we live in so two fucking libraries. Personal and public because when you make a shitload of money, you should build libraries.\n\nBuild your skills.\nQuickbooks is definitely top of the list on financial tools. When you get a couple paychecks, buy an old desktop version and create a fake company with fake vendors. Fake customers fake invoices, fake bank accounts fake credit cards, fake purchasing fake, receiving and play business in that sandbox until you master quickbooks. When you get hung up on something, go online and look at youtube. OR work on your networking and social engineering skills and make friends with the people that are in the accounting department, payroll department accounts, receivable, payable department at your job and ask them, hey, my wife and I are hung up on this with our quick books.How would you get through this?\n\nPeople love to help when it's something they're good at.\n\nVolunteer some hours late at night, or on the weekend to help the warehouse.Get orders out when they're busier to do inventory at the job that you work. Help I t set up new computers and monitors for the new salespeople or whatever when you get a chance. Don't count the cost.\n\nStudy, whatever industry you're in, find out who the top five players are.And see what they do to come to market differently from the company.That you're in currently. Why do they do it? How did the company work for start? Who is the first person that got hired?And why? Learn everything about the supply chains and the distribution chains and the channels to market and the customers themselves.\n\nAll of these things will paint a picture for you.And you will understand where you're at better than anyone around you.That's just punching a clock doing their job.Because you're not paid to do all that extra shit.\n\nOver the years, you're gonna build up undeniable skill, sets experiences and knowledge.And your character's gonna develop, because character's not just being honest.I'm a good guy.I've got good character, no, it's resilience.It's fortitude, it's perseverance.It's living outside your comfort zone to where you can't even see the fucking boundary.Because it's so far away and you're so uncomfortable.But that's where you grow.That's the gift!\n\nOver time years for me, it was decades. You'll start to see things and question em and dig and research further.And then bring them to the owners of the company and say, what if we did this differently like this. Don't bring it to him until you have a plan.As if you were gonna bring it to market that day. They're gonna tell you someone older, smarter.Wiser, more educated, more experienced would have done it.If it was possible or even the arrogant owner themselves will tell you they would have done it. But if you've proven yourself as undeniably valuable at your job, they're gonna say, if you want to mess with that, go ahead, mess with it.In your free time.\n\nHere's where you get to build more experience. You get to bring something to market and you won't get credit for it.And you won't get paid for it.In most cases, you'll make a company a lot of money.And you'll just get screwed.\n\nBut they can't take the skills or the knowledge or the experience or the character that you get to build in that process away from you.\n\nYour character is a soft component.It's your personal value.\n\nYou can't find something if you don't already have it. You must find something of value and bring it to the marketplace.But first you have to become valuable.\n\nThis is what i've done.And it's worked every time. It's not the short path. It's not the easiest path. But anyone can do it. When you get further down the path, you can reply to me and I'll help you with the how too's.\n\nIt's worth it.",

Most people do not start with a clear business idea that feels meant for them, that usually comes after doing something boring or messy first. The internet makes it look like everyone woke up with a genius concept, but in reality most ideas are discovered through action, not thinking.\n\nGiven your situation, unemployed, low capital, not technical, working from home, you are actually in a good spot for service based things rather than products or SaaS. Services look unsexy but they teach you sales, communication, and problem solving fast, and those skills transfer to almost any business later. You do not need to love the idea, you just need to tolerate it enough to learn from it.\n\nThe trap you want to avoid is waiting for clarity before starting. Clarity usually shows up after you have tried a few things and failed a bit. Pick something small, cheap, and reversible, give it a few months, and see what you learn. Even if it does not work, it will make the next idea much clearer.\n\nNot knowing what you want to build yet does not mean you are behind.

Should I do job? Should I do my own business? And then after that, when I decided I will do my own job, then what kind of job, what kind of business, what kind of products? I mean, I was always confused because the main reason was what I noticed in like seven to eight years when I was struggling with these kind of things, I was struggling with my own thoughts. I noticed I was comparing with myself with others' people and thinking that I am a slow person. I'm thinking that I do not have the capability to do something. Okay, instead I have to do, I have to work on my skill.\n\nI was just noticing others' people's stories, just like you are doing right now. So that pattern, I also had that time. So it is called a validation, you can say. Taking validation from external. And this happens when, when you don't know your own voice, when you don't know what is your belief. Because your beliefs are not your beliefs, okay, right now. Your beliefs are from The world that shaped  you from the people around you that you. So what pattern I have noticed in myself and I think you should also notice in yourself, maybe you can relate with me. So I'm just honestly sharing my journey a little bit.\n\nSo maybe it will help you out. First of all, taking validation, yeah. What do i mean by taking validation? If I am comparing with other people. Even though I know the whole thing that, okay, social media is fake, still, still my belief are not trusting that thoughts. They believe that, yes, I am slow or not doing anything because of reality because your are not doing anything that's why you think alot.. okay. \n\nSo I was always talking negative about myself because I was comparing, I was taking validation. I was not sure what to do i had no comfidnce, I wanted to do something, but not for me that time. I wanted to do something for the world, for other people to show, show up, you can say. So I was not even honest with myself. Right now, what ever I'm sharing, I faced my honesty, truth. I set with my ugly thoughts after seven to eight years, I got to realize that these are the patterns and the root cause was different.\n\nThe root cause was just one thing. And that was... I just have to believe myself. I just do not have to show everyone. I just do not have to prove anyone. I don't have to prove anyone in this world. I just have to be with myself and just try to figure out the root cause of what's I'm dealing with it. Because it's not about the business or anything. It's about what's going on in your world. What's the thing that affected that you are believing like this? \n\nWhat do you adapt in your circumstance that you are talking negative about yourself? I mean, there are lots of things that I wanted to share with you, but that's the pattern I noticed. The main thing is, I would say that stop taking validation it will be hard at first and I would just suggest you recommend one thing. Just sit in silence with yourself  I mean, no phone, no nothing. I would also  suggest you go for lak . Just go for a walk in the park and just notice around, what people are doing. And just do walk at least 10 to 15 minutes. And whatever the thoughts coming in your mind, maybe related to your business or anything, you will get the answer. Just do it for at least 7 days and you will maybe get the idea that you are looking right now.",

Tons of legit businesses start from a bedroom with zero paperwork at the beginning. Product vs service: services are usually easier when you’re broke and inexperienced.

You've already answered that elsewhere (Actually, before even asking the PvS question) by telling us about your lack of resources. If you lack resources, then service is THE way to go, at least initially. Nothing you do is ever set in stone, so you can pivot into production later, when you have the resources to do so. \n\nYou mentioned business consulting or PR. Those are tough to sell at your age without a proven track record. Look for \"doing\" services instead of \"advising\" services. Can you manage social media? Can you write copy? Can you edit short-form video? Can you handle basic administrative tasks for a local business?\n\nHere's what I'd do to start (Remember, this is just advice, not THE way to go) Pick one boring service, find one person who needs it, and try to make $100 or equivelant. Once you do that, the \"cloud\" of ideas usually starts to clear because you're actually in the game instead of watching from the sidelines. Have you ever heard that it's easier to find a job when you already have one? The same applies here, once you're actually IN THERE doing SOMETHING, no matter how small, you'll find more oppurtunities.\n\nThe very best advice I can give... NEVER be afraid to fail.",

The people doing this work hate it and the company would pay real money to make it go away.\n\nThe reason this is the \"boring business\" of tech:\n\n1. Nobody tweets about building inventory management software for auto parts distributors. Its not sexy. It will never go viral. And thats exactly why competition is low.\n\n2. The customers are easy to find. They are literally posting job ads for roles that exist only to manage these manual processes. If a company is hiring a \"data entry specialist\" or \"operations coordinator\" you know they have a process that could be automated.\n\n3. Switching costs are insane. Once a company builds their workflow around your tool they will not switch for years. Thats recurring revenue with almost zero churn.\n\n4. You dont need venture capital. These businesses can be profitable from month one because you are replacing a salary not competing for attention.\n\nThe unsexy truth is that the best tech businesses solve problems that are too boring for most developers to care about.

      "selftext": "Last year I had a client that made up about 40% of my revenue. They were also the reason I was working 60+ hour weeks, constantly stressed, and slowly losing every other client I had.\n\nHere's what happened and why letting them go changed everything.\n\n**The situation:**\n\nThis client was a mid-size ecommerce brand. They paid well -- around $4,500/month. But they were absolutely brutal to work with. Scope creep on every project. \"Quick\" requests that turned into full rebuilds. Calls at 10pm because someone on their team had an \"urgent\" idea. And the worst part -- they treated every deliverable like it was never good enough, even when results were clearly there.\n\nI told myself I couldn't afford to lose them. 40% of revenue is a lot. So I kept bending over backwards.\n\n**What I didn't realize:**\n\nWhile I was spending 70% of my time on this one client (for 40% of the revenue), my other clients were getting the leftovers. Response times got slower. Quality dropped. I lost two smaller clients in the span of three months -- not because they were unhappy with results, but because they felt like they weren't a priority. They were right.\n\nI was also turning down new leads because I literally didn't have capacity. Looking back, I probably passed on $15-20K in potential annual revenue just because I was drowning in this one account.\n\n**The breaking point:**\n\nThey asked me to redo an entire month's work because someone new joined their marketing team and \"had a different vision.\" No additional pay. When I pushed back, they implied they'd find someone else.\n\nThat's when it clicked. I was running my business like an employee, not an owner. One client had all the leverage because I let them.\n\n**What I did:**\n\nI spent two weeks quietly lining things up. Reached out to old leads, reconnected with past clients, tightened up my processes. Then I had the conversation. Professional, respectful, but clear: we weren't a good fit anymore.\n\n**The aftermath:**\n\n- Month 1: Revenue dropped 35%. Scary as hell. But my stress dropped by about 80%.\n- Month 2: Picked up two new clients from referrals I finally had time to follow up on.\n- Month 3: Revenue was back to where it was, but spread across 5 clients instead of being dependent on one.\n- Month 6: Revenue was up 40% from my best month ever. And I was working about 40 hours/week instead of 60.\n\n**What I learned:**\n\n1. If one client is more than 25% of your revenue, you don't have a business -- you have a job with extra steps.\n2. Bad clients don't just cost you time. They cost you the good clients you can't serve properly.\n3. The fear of losing revenue is almost always worse than actually losing it. You adapt faster than you think.\n4. Your best new clients usually come from giving existing good clients the attention they deserve.\n5. \"I can't afford to lose this client\" is the most dangerous sentence in business. It means they own you.\n\nI'm not saying fire every difficult client. Some are demanding but fair, and that pushes you to be better. But if a client makes you dread opening your laptop in the morning, something needs to change.\n\nAnyone else been through something similar? Curious how others handled the transition.",

That's the real cost nobody talks about. You don't lose them to a competitor, you lose them to your own neglect because all your energy is going to the wrong place.\n\n  \nTwo things that helped me after cutting the cord:\n\n  \n1. I now cap any single client at 20% of revenue max. If one client starts creeping past that, I actively go find more work elsewhere before it becomes a dependency. Prevention beats cure.\n\n  \n2. I started qualifying clients harder upfront. The red flags were always there with that big client, I just ignored them because the money was good.

And the quality of work you deliver to everyone else goes way up, which compounds over time through referrals.\n\n  \nOne thing I'd add: the stress reduction alone was worth it.

That's the hidden tax of bad clients. They don't just take time, they crowd out better opportunities you never get to say yes to.\n\nI also like that you didn't rage-quit. You lined things up, stabilized, and exited professionally. That's the difference between reacting and running a business intentionally.\n\nFor anyone reading this: the goal isn't zero difficult clients. It's optionality.

Some coaches I know even let clients book via WhatsApp or SMS directly - it's more conversational and removes friction.\n\n\n\nFor the website itself, keep it dead simple: who you are, what you do, testimonials, and clear contact info.

Blogs every month, indexed, keywords sprinkled everywhere. Traffic was flat and barely any leads. When I looked closer, the issue wasn’t effort. It was clarity.\n\nOnce we simplified things, clearer homepage, clearer service pages, clearer explanations of what they actually do and who it’s for, a few things happened:\n\n* Google traffic became more relevant, even if it wasn’t huge\n* AI tools started referencing them for very specific use cases\n* Leads understood the offer before the call\n\nI’ve also seen the opposite. Clients with strong authority or lots of content, but vague messaging, rarely show up in AI answers. The systems don’t know *when* to recommend them.\n\nSo to your questions:\n\n* Traditional SEO still helps with visibility, but it’s mostly the foundation now\n* Blog content works when it explains real problems and use cases, not when it’s just “content”\n* AI visibility isn’t random. The pattern I keep seeing is clear explanations + consistent language across the site + getting your brand mentioned in various places\n\nhope this helps",

          "body": "Great find - this thread nails the exact shift happening right now.\n\nTraditional SEO is getting tougher for startups because people increasingly ask AI (Perplexity, Claude, Grok, etc.) instead of typing queries into Google. The answer often comes from the model's interpretation/synthesis, not direct site ranking. If your startup gets distorted, omitted, or lumped with wrong competitors in those responses, even solid on-page SEO won't help much - decisions happen before anyone hits your site.\n\nI've been digging into this a lot lately. One thing that's surprisingly effective (and underrated) is actively auditing + optimizing how LLMs perceive your company: what labels/associations/strengths/weaknesses they assign, where the perception gaps are vs. your real positioning, and targeted fixes (content tweaks, new angles) to make the model \"get\" you better. It's like GEO but focused on closing the reality vs. AI-narrative gap, which directly impacts early-stage discovery and trust.\n\nFor bootstrapped founders especially, this can be a high-leverage move cheaper/faster than scaling paid ads when the narrative is off.\n\nAnyone else experimenting with AI-perception tools or seeing real lifts from it in 2026? Curious what approaches are working beyond classic SEO. If anyone's curious, I can share more on how we've approached it for our own stuff (no pitch, just real talk). 😄",

Here are the ones that we mostly use today:\n\n* Windsurf Cascade/Cursor: Our engineering team mostly uses Winsurfs's cascade agent running on top of Claude Opus for almost everything! I think most of our engineers now claim they haven't really written a line of code manually in the last 3 months! They have kinda turned into product managers who guide the AI agent over actually programmers! Has resulted in our engineering output doubling easily!\n* Sierra: We have been using Sierra (I think Intercom fin is an alternative) which has helped reduce our support ticket load by about 30% but auto resolving questions that doesn't need a human intervention. For example, questions about things that are already documented on our website, already answered previously etc! It can also basically connect with CRMs, Stripe etc to pull up details for them automatically!\n* Frizerly: Their AI agent can learn all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog on our website every day! We usually let is publish as a draft and manually switch it to published after a quick review! \n* Otter: We have been using Otters Ai agent to automatically transcribe, summarize create action items, update CRMs etc after every customer and internal call. Basically this has allowed us to build a single repository of all customer conversations in Notion automatically as well! This was a huge pain point for our sales team earlier\n* Clay: We have taught Clay our ideal customer personal using previous conversions. Now it can automatically reach out on both email and LinkedIn to schedule our first sales calls for our sales team. Saves a lot of time for everyone. Conversion rate for the automation is same as manual outreach at this point. \n\nCurious what others are using :)",

And that’s usually where things start to break.\n\nThe most useful agents I’ve seen are the ones that help leaders and teams see more clearly: summarizing information, reducing cognitive load, and bringing clarity to decision-making.\n\nIf there’s no alignment around goals, roles, and communication, adding more automation usually just speeds up the confusion.\n\nIn my experience, AI works best when strategy comes first.

Great for strategy work.\n\n📋 Outreach &amp; follow-up agents : they draft personalized outreach, reminders, and sequences based on brief inputs rather than manual writing.\n\n🧠 Knowledge assistants : manage internal docs, product specs, meeting notes, and make them searchable via natural language.\n\n🪄 Content co-creation agents: help turn an idea into a structure, then into actionable drafts (not just fluff). The best ones give you *framework + context*, not just words.\n\n🤖 Workflow orchestrators:  agents that can chain tasks (e.g., scan email → summarize → propose actions → send replies) are still emerging, but super powerful when configured right.\n\nFor many teams, the ROI isn’t a single tool:  it’s how you *embed* an agent into a real workflow (e.g., weekly competitor summary + task suggestions, or automated status updates).\n\nCurious: what’s the biggest bott your team wants to remove first :  research, writing, communication, or execution?\n\n",

I have never felt pressure like this in such a long time because I was used to training employee sizes of &lt; 50.

My back being against the wall is just what comes with it. It is situations like this that causes you to expand your knowledge base, your understanding as a business owner, and your willingness to adapt.\n\nI would love any feedback from anyone who has done huge training sessions for businesses before (does not have to be ai focused training).

Batch it - maybe 50-100 per session with different skill levels. The \"beginner trying to learn Claude\" and \"power user wanting advanced prompting\" should NOT be in the same room.\n\nFulfillment trick: Record everything. Seriously. Your 5-day training becomes 50+ hours of reference material they can revisit. Also helps with the people who miss sessions.\n\nPost-training support: Set expectations upfront. Maybe 30 days of Slack/email support, then transition to monthly check-ins. Don't let it become \"lifetime tech support\" - learned that the hard way.\n\nThe fear is normal - I remember my first 200+ person training feeling like I was going to throw up. But here's the thing: they hired YOU because you know this stuff better than they do. You're not imposing on them, you're solving their problem.\n\nAlso: charge for the scale complexity, not just the headcount. 1,000 people isn't 20x harder than 50 - it's 50x harder.\n\nYou got this.

It's like the pressure is worse when it's your own thing.\n\nWhat's helped me a bit is realizing that burnout makes you less productive for weeks, but a day off just costs you one day. The math actually makes sense to rest. But yeah I still feel restless when I do it. I'll take a day off and spend half of it thinking about work instead of actually recharging which defeats the purpose.\n\nI don't think the guilt ever fully goes away honestly.

I've been running my own thing for a while now and the guilt is still there, I just got better at ignoring it.\n\nThe reframe that helped me: you're not managing your time, you're managing your energy. They're completely different things. Building a company is a marathon. Nobody trains for a marathon by running every single day until their knees give out. You train smart, you rest on purpose, and you show up fresh when it counts. The guilt comes from thinking rest is the opposite of work, but it's actually part of the work.\n\nHere's what actually shifted things for me: I stopped treating rest as \"not working\" and started treating it as a responsibility. Your business needs you thinking clearly, not running on fumes making bad calls. I've made some of my worst decisions (wrong product decisions, misread documents) during stretches where I was \"grinding\" on 5 hours of sleep and zero downtime. Those mistakes cost way more than a Tuesday off ever would.\n\nThe guilt probably won't disappear entirely. But you can get to a point where you feel it and take the day anyway, because you know the version of you that comes back rested is worth more than the version that pushed through.",

          "body": "The guilt is real and it's one of the hardest parts of running your own business. Here's what finally helped me reframe it:\n\nYour business needs you to make good decisions more than it needs you to be constantly busy. And good decision-making requires a brain that isn't fried. When you're burned out, you're not actually being productive - you're just present. There's a huge difference.\n\nI started treating rest days like business investments. Would I skip maintaining equipment because I'm too busy using it? No, because it would break. Your brain is your primary business tool.\n\nWhat worked for me:\n\n1. Schedule days off in advance, not when you're already exhausted. Put them on the calendar like client meetings. It's easier to take a day off when it's planned than when you wake up and decide that day.\n\n2. Define what a good rest day looks like FOR YOU. For me, it's not lying on the couch feeling guilty. It's doing something active that's not work - hiking, reading, building something with my hands. The physical activity actually helps more than passive rest.\n\n3. Track your output before and after rest days. I noticed my best work weeks almost always came after I took a real day off. The quality of thinking was just better.\n\n4. Remember that your competitors burning themselves out isn't an advantage for them - it's a vulnerability. The business that can sustain its pace wins, not the one that sprints until it collapses.\n\nThe restless feeling during time off? That fades once you prove to yourself that taking breaks doesn't derail everything. The first few times are the hardest.",

The business didn't just survive while I was gone, it actually thrived.\n\nIf your business can’t handle you taking a day off to play football or read, you haven’t built a company, you’ve just built a really high-pressure job for yourself. taking a break is basically a \"stress test\" for your business. If it breaks while you’re gone, you just found a bug you need to fix.\n\nStop viewing rest as laziness and start viewing it as necessary maintenance for the Founder. You're no good to the company if you're burnt out and making \"tired\" decisions.",

I'm still new to being self-employed and discussing billing + payment, but all of my clients I've had so far have been trustworthy and prompt about paying me. Now that I've been doing this for a while I've started to encounter people who become offended when I discuss payment. \n\nThis week a potential new client inquired with me and was perfectly pleasant during our consultation, but when I told her payment is due immediately at the end of each weekly cleaning she said \"due after EACH cleaning?\" and said \"sure\", but suddenly seemed annoyed. Later on she texts me to confirm a date and time for the first cleaning, and because I still felt uneasy about her willingness to pay I decide to text her \"Perfect, I've scheduled you for \\[date &amp; time\\]. What payment method would work best for you?\" I stated it this way to implicitly remind her that I expect payment same-day, without appearing rude or demanding. \n\nShe immediately cancelled without explanation 😑 She also said she would be in touch with me \"another time\", but if she does would I be justified in politely informing her I no longer want to clean for her? I don't want to perform work for a client who is obviously reluctant to follow my payment policy. I really don't think it's outrageous for a professional cleaner to expect payment for their services at the end of each weekly or biweekly cleaning session. What do you think? What have your experiences with clients who disagree with your payment policies been like? ",

The goal of idea #1 is not to build a unicorn, its to get you into the habit of shipping something, talking to users, and iterating. That feedback loop teaches you more than any amount of planning.\n\n  \nAlso the chiropractor comment above is spot on.

But when I started out in 2014, I was one of the only people at networking events I'd go to who was talking about direct response marketing and tracking ROI. \n\nIt's long been a symptom of big Madison Avenue ad agencies that they just get ridiculous budgets to do \"branding\" where they splatter a company's name everywhere and that's it. The thought process is just creating a gut-level recognition through familiarity. Like Coca Cola has done. To become a household name. \n\nBut nobody has ever been able to outright *prove* it brings a higher ROI. There are correlation studies but causation has to be inferred.  \n\nI used to rail against \"branding campaigns\" when I had a newsletter for small businesses back in the day. Because there was a lot of misconception at the time. And still is. Small businesses are smarter now for the most part in that they know just \"branding\" is throwing money in the toilet. Passively branding to existing customers is a better approach for most businesses. \n\nThat's true until you have over a billion-dollar budget.

They aim for an emotional impact rather than a rational one because it’s all about memorability. Emotion builds memory structures. The goal is to build greater mental availability than the competition so that your brand comes to mind instead of theirs. \n\nThere’s a priming aspect to it too. Showmanship makes your brand more likeable. Think of Pavlovian conditioning with the ringing of a bell when a dog is given food. They are then conditioned to start salivating when they hear the bell but not given the food. You’re slowly being conditioned to like the brand and perhaps even smile when you see the logo. We like to think we make rational decisions but research shows we mostly make emotional decisions. We rationalise it later.",

Because they’re not even the same experience. That’s kind of how I see the whole “content creation is cheaper now” debate.\n\nYeah, sure, it’s easier and cheaper to churn out content, but that just means *everyone’s* doing it. Thirty years ago, only a handful of companies could even get visibility. Now? Your grandma’s got a TikTok account, and every brand under the sun is flooding the internet with posts. Standing out is harder than ever.\n\nBut then you’ve got something like TV ads. Love ‘em or hate ‘em (efficient, inefficient, whatever) at least they’re still reserved for the big players who can afford them. Less competition, more visibility. And since marketing’s all about trust and familiarity, being able to pop up in places your competitors *aren’t*? That’s still a huge win.\n\nThat’s actually one of the biggest takeaways I got from studying the RIO framework: don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Use multiple channels, but keep your message consistent across all of them. Hammer it home again and again, and create a journey that makes sense for your customers. That way, they actually *get* what you’re about, and you’re not just another voice in the noise.",

I asked my bank if they could just let me use the ATM for business deposits and they said it's against their policy, something about fraud prevention.\n\nSome food truck owners I know just spend the cash on supplies and inventory so they don't have to deposit it, but my accountant said that's a grey area for tax purposes and I should be depositing everything. I'm stuck between following the rules and wasting hours of my life going to bank branches during the only time they're open.\n\nHow are other cash based businesses handling this without losing their minds?",

I had read about some studies that showed that people got as much of a dopamine boost from talking about doing things as they got from actually doing things. So to avoid the talk, talk, talk trap. I kept my mouth shut. There were a few people who were mentor types who I talked to, but for the most part I didn't tell friends about all the work I was doing setting up my business. My mantra was that my work would do the talking later. It kind of drove my wife crazy when people would ask my about what I was doing and I would just talk about parenting. For me, personally, I could feel the energy that would have gone into talking about it go into actually doing things to build it. It may or may not work for other people, but I really credit this strategy for helping me stay focused on the work instead of seeking affirmation from talking about it.\n\nLearning basic spreadsheet skills really helped manage things before I got to the point where I could use purpose built tools. I still use spreadsheets, but not as much anymore.\n\nI ran things cheap for as long as it made sense. I think many people see spending money as an accomplishment, like, \"Look at these sweet chairs I bought, I'm a legit business!\" Avoid that.",

BUT when you really know nothing about how to start a business, have no one to help you, and need to do it quickly… it’s probably your best chance at not missing something. If I had given things a little more thought beforehand, I probably could’ve gotten things up and going on my own with a little research and guidance from my mother in law that used to put together shell corporations for the law firm she worked for. Really wish I would’ve known that last little detail. 😕\n\nAnyway, from a bookkeeping standpoint… find out what needs to be filled out at the state level and what needs to be submitted at the federal level. Product based businesses will have different requirements than service based businesses. And then take note of when federal taxes will need filed. Some do estimations quarterly, some do it annually with their personal taxes… and that’ll depend on what type of business you file for (LLC, Sole Proprietorship, S Corp, etc).\n\nFrom a personal standpoint, make sure you have the time and resources to support this venture. I got myself into debt pretty quickly thinking I needed to have a bunch of options. I have a product based business and while inventory is important… my inventory grew way too large, very quickly. So, space became scarce for me. I’m working full time because my business doesn’t support a livable wage yet, so time to build a website and create marketing campaigns rats DEEP into family time for me. I feel like even when I’m home, I work until I go to bed and not even on anything that I actually sell… it’s all on stuff just to hopefully get my business in front of people that might hopefully buy my products. I hope that one day this ship rights itself because right now I feel like I don’t know which way is up. It’s not for the faint of heart, that’s for sure! I wish I would have had a clearer, more edited picture of what I wanted to offer and how I wanted to offer it… instead I feel like I’m always scrambling.\n\nTL:DR- LegalZoom is helpful, but pricey. And do some market research before investing time and money into it. Like others have said, you need to make sure there’s actually a market for what you want to offer.",

I used simple tools to stay organized, but the bigger unlock was consistently listening to how potential customers talked about their problems, especially in places like forums and communities. Patterns start showing up pretty fast if you actually look for them.\n\nAt some point I started using Syndr AI to surface those recurring conversations instead of manually digging through threads. Not as a planning tool, more as a way to sanitycheck whether an idea was actually showing demand before I went deeper. That saved me from building a few things nobody really cared about.\n\nBiggest advice start messy, talk to real people early, and don’t overbuild systems until you understand what problem you’re really solving.

I keep getting groups of customers sometimes 15–20 people, asking for the same specific item or style. The problem is I might only have 3–4 of those pieces or a few similar ones. People are actually willing to wait for restocks, which is great but after a few weeks I end up having to message them explaining that I just couldn’t source more of it and they’re understandably disappointed. I know exactly what my customers want, I just can’t seem to get enough of it.\n\nUp until now I’ve been sourcing from smaller vintage wholesalers, local markets and random finds but it’s clearly not scaling with demand anymore. I feel like I’m starting to lose customers not because they don’t like my shop but because I can’t provide enough quantity of the things they want. So I wanted to ask here where do you find bigger more reliable vintage suppliers?\n\n",

While few things are truly one-of-a-kind, there not making any more, so getting repeats of anything are difficult.\n\nAssuming you want to stay true to being a vintage business, as many of us do, you just have to be willing to scale your picking. Estate sales, garage sales, Facebook marketplace, and frequent thrift store visits. Trying to find people will to sell larger “lots” of items you specialize in and you can buy inventory in bulk and at lower prices. I always have 3 times as much inventory in my garage as I can sell at one time in my shop. \n\nSome of the larger stores get to a point where they can afford to pay professional pickers, but then your prices have to go up. I don’t do clothes personally, but the dealers I know who do and successful often network their way to finding individuals from whom they can purchase their entire collection for a set price and then sort the sellable from the donation pile. My mother (also a dealer) does this and will often leave with 8-10 huge trash bags of clothes from one house. Half to 2/3 goes to donation, but when she bought it all for $400 the margins are insane. \n\nThe purchasing often takes more time than the actual selling, so you really have to commit yourself to that being a central part of the business model.",

The confusion about virtual addresses and registered agents is real, especially because things like bank accounts and Amazon seller verification can have strict requirements about what kind of address is acceptable. From what you described, it sounds like you need a service that not only registers your LLC but also provides a legitimate registered agent address that works with compliance and practical needs like receiving official mail.\n\nI had a similar challenge and used BusinessAnywhere for setting up my U.S. company and handling the registered agent part. The platform handled the LLC registration and provided an address that held up for official documents and compliance. It made the whole compliance piece way easier since they bundle the registration with ongoing services so I didnt worry about missing filings or mail.

He's been less than pleasant about the whole ordeal, and has decided to just stop participating in operations while the payout is negotiated. A bit overwhelmed at the moment, mostly the books, as it has been his task to manage over the years. During the valuation, I discovered drastically inflated inventory assets and cash holdings. Have crawled the books trying to get everything proper but it's so overwhelming. How do you solo acts do it? Very impressive for single owner businesses to work, especially at the ground floor.

Passwords, processes, client contacts. If your partner has info you need, get it before things get worse.\n\n2. Talk to a lawyer before making big moves. Even a 30-min consultation can save you months of pain later.\n\n3. Assess if the business is viable solo. Sometimes the answer is no, and thats OK. Better to know early.\n\n4. Reach out to your clients directly. Transparency builds trust. Let them know whats happening (at a high level) and that youre committed.\n\nThe emotional part is real too. Losing a business partner feels like a breakup. Give yourself space to process it while still protecting the business.\n\nI write about these founder challenges in my newsletter if you want more tactical stuff: https://substack.com/@francoisdelpte",

Recently though I’ve started running into a challenge I didn’t really expect. I’ve noticed that certain products get a lot of attention all at once. I’ll have multiple customers sometimes over a dozen asking for the same exact item or version of something. The problem is I usually only have a small amount available and once it’s gone, it’s really difficult for me to find more of that same product again.\n\n\n\n  \nSome customers are patient and willing to wait, which I really appreciate but there have been many times where I’ve had to follow up later and let them know I couldn’t restock it after all. It’s not a great feeling especially knowing they were ready to buy. What makes it harder is that I feel like I have a good understanding of what people want. The interest is there and I’m seeing clear patterns in demand. My biggest issue right now is finding reliable ways to replenish those popular items fast enough.\n\n\n\n  \nSo far I’ve mostly relied on smaller vendors and independent sources which worked well in the beginning but now it feels like I’ve outgrown that stage. I’m at the point where I need something more consistent if I want to keep growing and avoid turning customers away. For those who’ve experienced something similar how did you handle it?",

Is it automated? The faster you are able to communicate to your supply chain that a product is in demand, the faster you are able to communicate to your users whether you can satisfy their needs. It's also possible that you might be able to meet demand better if your suppliers knew ahead of time that there was a burst of interest. \n\nYou're working with small vendors and independent sources. Are you sure that isn't a major contributing factor to your existing growth?\n\nGrowth and consistency can be derived from various sources, not just just by adapting to existing big business models. \n\nReview case studies of businesses who have failed despite being in a position to grow simply because they changed too much of what made them unique and attractive in the first place. If you are doing well with your secret recipe, then more secret recipe is better than changing the recipe. \n\nWhat about expanding with more suppliers and different products that are similar or in the same niche? You say that you've analyzed and identified what trends exist that would allow you to pre-empt situations like this. Talk to your suppliers. See what they can do to meet demand, or work with other suppliers who can meet your demand while still providing the same quality product. Diversify your catalog. That would allow you to consistently order for demand and also offer related products to offset low supply. \n\nI've worked in e-commerce as a software developer for a long time, and my clients often want a quick solution, technological or otherwise, to problems like these. In reality, if you have customers who want a product, and a supply chain who can create those products, why can't you facilitate that transaction?

A few things that helped me when I hit this stage:\n\n1. **Pre-orders with deposits** - When something sells out, let people put down 20-30% to reserve it. Shows you real demand and gives you capital to buy inventory.\n\n2. **Supplier tiering** - Keep your small vendors for unique/hard-to-find items, but for your consistent top sellers, find 2-3 mid-size suppliers who can do recurring orders. Redundancy saves you when one falls through.\n\n3. **Track your velocity** - If you know Product X sells 15 units/month, you can plan reorders before you hit zero. Even a simple spreadsheet with reorder points changed my game.\n\n4. **Be honest with customers** - A waitlist with realistic timelines beats \"sorry, sold out.\" People respect transparency and will often wait if you communicate well.\n\nThe transition from scrappy sourcing to real supply chain management is one of the harder jumps.

          "body": "&gt; maybe fewer damage claims or disputes.\n\nWhere have you heard this.  I have no insider knowledge but everything I've heard is the opposite and that is common sense IMO.   More touch points more liability.\n\nIn general to your question I would ask back, \"Do you?\"\n\nFirst is this something your guests even want or would use let alone expect.  If price is a major selling point they are not going to want to do it just for tip reasons. \n\nAlso consider the groups who wont use it and what percentage of the guests they make up.   People with nicer cars often won't use valet for obvious reasons.  Business travelers often won't because they don't want to waste time waiting for the car.  And people with rentals may not because of rental agreement rules or fears of damage.  etc etc\n\nSecond consider the costs.  You will need this 24/7 or at least a way for the people to get their cars.   Would having an extra one or two staff members working at all times hurt profit?  (And is that even the best use of extra staff?)   How about the the insurance costs?  Sure you could simply hire a company to provide these workers and the insurance but of course that will likely cost similar if not more vs direct hires.  \n\nThird consider the headaches vs peak check in vs check out.  Part of why business travelers wont use it.  As people are waiting for their cars to be moved/brought up.   Sure it is bad now but would it be better?   \n\nAnd now instead of them blaming some other guest they blame you directly.   \n\nSure it may avoid some idiot leaving their car up front while they take their bags up and spend 30 mins in their room before parking.   But will they actual use the valet or is that just a car making the valet service worse?  \n\nAnd if that is an issue there are other options to consider to combat it like signage and staff training.  \n\nIn the end IMO if a hotel doesn't already have valet they likely are not in the right market segment to add it.  People know at least subconsciously they are paying more to get more.  They are not expecting or wanting to pay for valet when they book a place that shouldn't.\n\nIDK how much more per night you would need to charge to cover valet but prices would go up and tipping means most will pay more even if it doesn't.   \n\nIf those people were willing to pay more for valet and etc why didn't they?   Really think about that.   Don't hunt down customers who wouldn't stay at your place unless where they wanted wasn't available.  And don't price yourself out of customers who would stay if the price was just a bit less.  \n\nYour competition is unlikely to be the 5 star hotel in town.   It is the other 2-3 star(?) places.  Price and location plus basic quality are what you are likely competing on.  Free breakfast might help you win but I doubt valet would.   It just isn't something people in that market are IMO normally looking for.",

      "selftext": "Hi Reddit,\n\nI run a small business in Canada and recently had a situation with a U.S. customer. She ordered a product, paid for shipping at checkout, but when UPS tried to deliver it, they demanded an additional $95 in tariffs and fees. She refused the delivery and asked for a refund.\n\nI want to issue a full refund, but only once the package is sent back to me, which is standard practice to protect my business from revenue loss. Most of the time, packages are returned within 2 weeks, sometimes sooner. I also need to track it to make sure it’s coming back safely.\n\nI’ve explained this to her, along with the fact that tariffs are determined by U.S. border control, not me, and that unfortunately some customers end up paying nothing, some pay a small fee, and some (like her) get hit with a high fee.\n\nMy question for Reddit: if you were me, would you have handled it differently? I’m genuinely trying to balance customer satisfaction with protecting my business. Do you wait for the package to be sent back to you? I sell bird toys and most of my orders average $100+. This package was $248 CAD dollars. \n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts!",

I say this because UPS has been incinerating parcels, at least according to the news (Google UPS incinerating packages). If it is incinerated you'll have even more troubles as you won't be able to prove delivery in the event of a chargeback. \n\nSecond, I agree that you should have the package in your possession but you'll also have to make sure UPS clears the goods back into Canada as a return otherwise you'll end up on the hook for Canadian tariffs. Hopefully you are already registered with CARM. \n\nI say all of this because I do a  lot of consulting for cross border businesses - and things have gotten crazy. Tariffs in the USA, CARM in Canada... I make money doing it but I can see how it is hurting small businesses. \n\nAlso - google freightos tariff calculator. They have made a great calculator that adds in all of the funky duties into the USA as long as you know your product. You can either provide a tariff estimate on your website or tell your customers to look it up before ordering. This might help prevent future occurrences. ",

But on the good, responsible business side of things and wanting to treat people the way you'd like to be treated, I say they've rejected the shipment so it's on you now to retrieve that package or eat the loss and they should he refunded immediately.  \n\nWe had all the right paperwork sorted early on last summer when this tariff nonsense went into effect. We are fully CUSMA-complaint.  Our first few dozen shipments went off without much of a hitch, aside from the very first one being rejected at the border because we had bad information from CBP, and then for about 2 weeks everything was taking a LONG time getting through customs, likely because of that bad advise we'd initially worked off of that everyone else was also working off of jamming up customs with all the rejections. Then it happened... Our first collision with customs. We received a $600US customs bill on a rejected package worth $100US retail.  No explanation, no way to fight it. And they would not return the package until we paid the bill, so we surrendered it but that didn't stop the bill. They're still trying to pursue us for it.  We had 3 others that week in transit to the US that went the same way and we immediately shut down all shipping to the US at that point.  They would not audit the bill nor would they detail the \"government charges\" of that exorbitant bill or any of the others; one was $275 on a $45 item, and these numbers don't include the return shipping bill either! \n\nAll shipping platforms and couriers have been saying that the shipper is responsible for the import charges if the shipment is rejected, which is insane as there's no actual import happening then. I could see them charging their brokerage fee for the little work they did in clearing the package but that's the least of the charges.  So be prepared that whomever cleared this for you may be coming back to you for the import fees that the customer rejected and to get this back you'll be paying the shipping a second time.  \n\nIf I were you I'd just be a good Judy and take the loss responsibly.  It's a tough pill to swallow but chalk it up to a learning lesson.  What if you tell them you'll only refund when you get it back in your hands but then it never gets returned? They ordered goods from you and then received a huge bill they weren't expecting and rejected it and returned it. If it were you would you not be fuming if the company wasn't returning your money when you did not have the product?\n\nWe're all forced to relearn how we do things in this new political climate unfortunately.  What's worked for so long is no longer feasible sadly. It comes at a time that we need an easier go of things, not more complicated versions of it!",

      "selftext": "As an employee at several companies over the years I was frustrated with the terrible, toxic culture, lack of structure, lack of clear boundaries, roles or expectations, the inefficiencies, etc. Once I had gained significant experience in the field, I went into consulting as a way to both get out from under the mess and potentially help companies change the way the operate.\n\nEven in roles as a director, I was hardly ever listened to in terms of what need to change or how, so I felt that I needed to be an outsider to actually get the owner's ear.\n\nAnd to a degree, this works. But honestly, it's really only at the larger and more corporate companies where I ever feel like anything I do actually gets put into place.\n\nhere are some of the pitfalls I see over and over again in small business:\n\n\\- Owners consumed by fear and paranoia. They keep a lot of info that isn't proprietary under wraps as if no one can be trusted with it, and then employees can't do their jobs because they don't have all of the information and tools they need. Even keeping different departments siloed from each other because they are afraid of them \"talking to each other\", when collaboration is necessary to complete the work. When employees leave in droves, whether to a competitor or to start their own enterprise, it usually isn't because they came in with that intention. Most people would prefer to stay at a job if it is tolerable rather than risk another unknown. So if you constantly hemorrhage staff, it is due to the toxic work environment, burnout, lack of feeling like they can do anything purposeful with the company.\n\n\\- constantly moving the goals posts, setting employees up for failure, and needing to be \"the only one who does anything right\". I have watched countless times as owners give 30% of the tools needed to do the job to someone, then call them into the office to ask why they didn't complete it the way they were never trained to and didn't have the necessary tool or information to do so. Then they often go on a rant that they can't trust anyone, no one wants to work anymore, no one know what they are doing. Yes, that last one is often true, and it's often the owner's fault. Later they reveal some document or file or tool or instruction that the employee would have need to complete the task, which now has to be redone in a waste of everyone's time and energy, but the owner still wants the employee to grovel about what a huge mistake they made.\n\n\\- zero accountability while constantly blaming other. I can't count on all my fingers and toes the number of times an owner was in the middle of berating someone for an error, then it is found that something was signed or submitted by the owner and it was their mistake, only to have them then go on a big showy rant \" WHO SIGNED MY NAME? WHO DID THIS?\". You lose respect and credibility when you want to constantly call out everyone else but can never own up to anything.\n\n\\-no real process for onboarding or continued education. Just slapping an additional title onto a grunt worker who seems to fear losing their job more than stroking out from running half the company for minimum wage, and calling it a day.  So now Gary is also HR on top of 3 other titles, as you send new employees to him and expect him to figure it out with no guidance, then will yell at Gary when you find out there isn't the full blown new employee training happening that you didn't actually hire a full time HR employee or HR consultant to build and put into place. And you wonder why people keep leaving after a couple months. No, they aren't all \"lazy people who don't want to work\". They literally never felt like part of the company or had a sense of their role, because there as no true onboarding or training.\n\n\\-no structure in general. No sense of project management, no debriefing to improve regular operations. Every day is like doing triage on passengers of a train that just derailed. Day after day after day. Everything feels on the fly, at the whims of the owner/owners, never forms into something more cohesive.\n\nThe majority if the small businesses I have attempted to help still ran like start ups even if they were 5, 10, 20 years old. And that's why they stay small and don't get anywhere. It isn't your marketer, it isn't the economy, it is most likely the owner.\n\nAnd the grand finale of all of this is, they seldom even let me come in and do my job either. They don't really want anything to change. At least I don't work for them, but it's gotten to the point where it's even getting too exhausting to work WITH them. I identify where changes are needed then they tell me they don't want to or can't change that because of XYZ. I still get paid either way, but it's really not fulfilling at all to just collect checks from tyrants for advice they won't use. I'd rather help companies actually put these things into action and improve.\n\nPlease, if you are a small business owner: recognize your areas of non-expertise, hire people into those roles, allow them to actually do their jobs, stop thinking you do everything perfectly and better than everyone in every department (you don't, and you look silly marching around micromanaging everyone while actually making things worse in your wake), show appreciation toward your employees instead of contempt, stop trying to control every detail and focus on being captain of the ship, taking it in a direction instead of spinning in circles.",

      "selftext": "At the beginning of 2025 I started my lifelong dream of opening a bakery. My shop is about 1300 sqft (leasing) I redid the entire space, new water heater, new floors, new fridges, dishwasher, sinks, I mean EVERYTHING is new and updated. I took out a $125k business loan and borrowed a little more from family. We opened back in August. \n\nSo far it’s been going fairly well, we do about $13k-15k in revenue every month and I pay myself a $48k salary with another full time and part time employee. Operating costs are about $10k-12k monthly (this includes my salary). We are in a small town so it’s nothing crazy but we are the only coffee shop and the only bakery so it works.\n\nUnfortunately I have had some serious health issues and as much as I do not want to, I need to switch career paths, one less aggressive on my body and mind. I owe about $100k on my business loan. Does selling my business for $150k seem super unrealistic? I’m not sure if I unreal expectations or this actually reasonable. \n\nAny advice about my situation is appreciate. ",

I would make sure if you've started a business on the side that it's undeniable to you that you're gonna be able to cover your personal overhead.\n\nI was fired in year three of my business.When a shipping container landed early. I didn't have a warehouse or four cliff or any of that stuff.So I made a deal with local muffler shop that was near my r.V park and the self storage unit I was using as my warehouse. They agreed to allow me to have the ship and container delivered and dropped on their property on the back parking lot. I would come after work the day of delivery and they would use their forklift to put the pallets in the back of my truck. I would ferry two pallets at a time. When I got to the storage unit, I would unload them by hand. Then go back and get another load.\n\nThe container arrived early and the broker didn't notify me. When they drop the container, they blocked the entranceway to the muffler shop parking lot. Customers couldn't get in and couldn't get out because there was a ditch around the parking lot. The owner called my cell phone but I was at work on a sales call and didn't answer immediately. So they called the office number.And they got the owner of the company. It's a muffaler shop owner was highly pissed off. \n\nWhen I got off of my sales call, I checked my messages and called the muffler shop owner. I then made an excuse to leave work for lunch early. I went and took care of everything. When I got back to work, the owner was not there.Which was not unusual. The next morning he was standing in my office took my laptop my phone and the company truck and fired me. He had been underpaying me for years and had encouraged myself and other employees to do things on the side.Like sell toolboxes or fix up cars and sell them to make ends meet. I had built my business, and he knew about it, but had not realized that it had grown to the size that it had.\n\nSo I went home and talked to my wife. It was november of 2019. We had gotten a heads up a month or two earlier from our factories in china and taiwan that something was happening.And everyone was dying.\n\nSo I decided to go full time in our business.Doing sales from home and picking and packing orders and the next thing you know, covid hit in America in early spring 2020.\n\nA two major manufacturers based in america that we are competing against both had to shut down ninety percent of their operations. So every truck repair shop in the industry was scampering to find the parts that were now not being supplied to the market.And they found us. We jumped from four figures a year in revenue to 7 figures a year in revenue that year. We still weren't taking any money from the business.Until the end of the next year, when we had to. \n\nWe maxed out every credit card that we could get our hands on.We took huge predatory loans at forty percent interest or higher to meet the needs of inventory. My wife was a retired teacher. College professor and when the local elementary special needs, teachers passed away from covid.She jumped in there and took over the classes for those kids.\n\nAll in all we made it.But it was a pretty scary time.\n\nI wouldn't jump out of your corporate job until you've replaced your income or the math says that you're gonna be okay.\n\nBusiness doesn't just take care of your needs in the beginning because you have traction. You've got to reinvest everything that you can back into that business.So it can grow until it's undeniable.\n\nThat takes years and years. So many new business owners are thinking about making money as fast as possible.That they fail to look ten years down the road. Taking resources out of your business to survive in the beginning.Slows down your growth exponentially.In most cases.",

However, in either case you still need exceptional quality for the price point products by having exceptional cost control, and being effective in the engineering, design, manufacturing, and in the marketing and so on.

          "body": "When people grow out of their first accounting tool, the pain is usually around reporting accuracy and time spent closing books, not basic invoicing. I’ve noticed when people compare accounting software as they scale, complaints tend to focus on complexity rather than missing features. That’s where Netgain fits into the conversation for teams on NetSuite, since it keeps reconciliations and close processes inside the system instead of relying on spreadsheets or separate tools. Same idea as avoiding unnecessary iOS downgrades, more control isn’t better unless it reduces effort.",

          "body": "When things start getting busy, figuring out what actually helps and what just adds clutter is a real challenge. A lot of people start with free tools like Wave or move to something like FreshBooks for more features, but every business has slightly different needs.\n\nSome useful features to look for: invoice tracking with clear dashboards, automatic payment reminders (saves a ton of time chasing late payments), and straightforward payment status monitoring. Overdue invoice alerts can really help stay on top of cash flow, especially if clients are slow to pay. Expense tracking and basic reporting are a must, but I’ve seen a lot of bloated tools where the reporting gets confusing fast.\n\nManual follow-ups and losing track of unpaid invoices were my biggest headaches. You can use Billzy for invoice management and payment reminders if you want something simple and focused just on getting paid reliably.\n\nTry to pick something that feels intuitive to you day-to-day, so you don’t end up spending more time managing the tool than actually running the business.",

          "body": "Biggest thing that saved me time was separating the receipt capture from the accounting software. I used to try to do everything in QBO and it was a mess. Receipts would pile up, I would forget to log stuff, then scramble at tax time.\n\nNow I just snap every receipt on my phone the moment I get it. Takes 3 seconds. Then once a week I reconcile everything. Went from hours of catch up to maybe 20 minutes.\n\nFor the actual accounting side, Wave is honestly great if you do not need payroll or inventory. Free, does invoicing and basic reporting. I would say do not overthink the software choice early on. Pick something, commit to it, and focus on building the habit of logging stuff as it happens instead of batching it later. That habit matters more than which tool you use.",
