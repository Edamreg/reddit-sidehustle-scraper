      "selftext": "I bought a Chevrolet Colorado in July of last year with the intention of starting a side hustle. I considered doing landscaping, hauling junk, or even buying a vending machine. However, while browsing Facebook Marketplace, I came across a listing for a used throne chair. I decided to research how much these chairs typically rent for in other areas and what I could potentially charge if I bought one. Keep in mind, I had no prior experience in the party or event business.\n\nDespite that, I decided to take a chance, bought the chair, and posted it for rent. The post received a lot of views, but no bookings at first. Most businesses in my area charge around $150 to rent a throne chair, plus a delivery fee, which usually brings the total to $180–$200. Since I wasn’t getting much interest, I decided to lower my price from $150 to $120, which also includes delivery within 30 minutes of where I live.\n\nAfter about 3.5 weeks and spending roughly $760, I honestly started to think buying the throne chair had been a bad idea. However, just a couple of days after lowering the price, I received my first booking—then my second, third, and so on. As bookings picked up, I eventually purchased a second throne chair for about the same price, except this one was brand new.\n\nFrom the end of August through the end of December, I made a little over $1,500. While most of that money went toward paying off the chairs, it became clear that there is a lot of potential in this type of business. Along the way, I’ve connected with people from schools, event coordinators, venue owners, and other local businesses.\n\nMy goal for this year is to make over $4,000. While that may not sound like a lot, it’s relatively easy money. The hardest part of the job is loading the chairs onto the truck and properly taking care of them. I make sure to clean them after every event and use bubble wrap on the corners and other important areas that could be easily damaged. I also purchased a tarp and stretch wrap to protect the chairs from dirt during delivery or while they’re waiting for the next booking.\n\nMy next goal is to add a bench throne and a 360 photo booth to the business. We’ll see what the future holds.",

          "body": "If you already work in data or analytics, there are a few side incomes that tend to be realistic and actually leverage that skillset instead of starting from zero.\n\nA lot of people do analytics consulting for small businesses. Things like setting up GA4 properly, cleaning up dashboards, or explaining where traffic or conversions are leaking. Small ecommerce brands especially struggle with this and will pay for clarity.\n\nAnother angle is freelance reporting or dashboard builds. Many founders don’t want complex models, they just want a simple weekly or monthly view that answers “what’s working and what isn’t.” That’s a fast win if you know SQL, Looker, Power BI, or Tableau.\n\nSome go the data audit or tracking setup route. Reviewing event tracking, pixels, attribution, and fixing broken data. It’s boring work for founders but high value.\n\nLonger term, people turn their experience into templates, tools, or micro products like dashboards, attribution spreadsheets, or cohort analysis templates and sell those repeatedly instead of trading time.\n\nThe common thread is that the money usually comes from translating data into decisions, not just running numbers. Businesses pay when analytics directly help them make or save money.",

Please feel free to critique my idea, let me know how you would tweak it, and what you think works or doesn’t work\n\nI noticed that a lot of adult content creators like to use a link in their bio, and that there are a good amount of complaints that current link in bio platforms (LinkTree, Link.me) have been known to cause issues and have accounts on social media flagged, reducing the amount of viewers they are getting which is impacting their revenue\n\nI put together a site to try and capture this market, but am looking at how to improve it further before trying to get clients. The site is already live but I haven’t advertised it in any way yet, and includes made up example link in bio pages\n\nEssentially I want to run a subscription model to create ultra basic link in bio sites, but on their own domain to avoid being flagged. Additional benefits over traditional link in bio services is that it is ad free, and that I am directly serving them so won’t make a policy change later down the line that no longer allows adult content creators.\n\nSo in all, it’s just selling websites as a subscription, niched down to adult content creators that want a unique link in bio on their own domain. By stripping back the features of standard websites, I can make them very cheap, quick and easily.\n\nI want to know if this sounds like something that could work, or if it’s fundamentally flawed with something I missed before taking the next steps of finding customers",

She told her friend at church about it and next thing I know I have 3 more people asking me to do it.\n\nI bought a decent video capture device on Amazon (the Elgato one, around $80) and started posting on local Facebook groups. Turns out theres SO many boomers and gen x folks who have boxes of old tapes, camcorder videos, and even those weird mini DV tapes sitting in their garage that they want digitized but have no idea how to do it.\n\nI charge $15 per tape for VHS and $20 for camcorder tapes cause they take a bit longer. Most people have like 10 to 30 tapes so the jobs add up quick. December was insane cause everyone wanted them done before the holidays, made around $950 that month. Its slowed down a bit now but still getting steady work.\n\nI can literally just let the tapes run while I'm working my regular job from home or watching TV. I also upload everything to a google drive folder for them and burn it to a DVD if they want (extra $5). Some people tip really well too cause they get emotional seeing their old family videos.\n\nNow I actually have $2k set aside from Stаke, but I'm kinda stuck on how to scale this up beyond just me doing it. I can only run like 2 or 3 tapes at a time with my current setup. Anyone have ideas on how to grow this without it turning into a full time thing? Or should I just keep it small and steady?",

          "body": "This is actually a really solid little business, and you stumbled into it the best way possible: by solving a real, emotional problem people already care about.\n\nA few things stand out to me. First, the demand you’re seeing isn’t a fad. People aren’t suddenly *creating* more VHS tapes, but the urgency is real because those tapes are literally degrading every year. Add the emotional angle and holidays, and you’ve got something people are happy to pay for and even tip on. That’s rare.\n\nOn scaling, the key is not trying to turn this into some startup-looking thing. The moment you do, it becomes stressful. The simplest way to grow without burning yourself out is parallelization. More capture devices, more VCRs, and a slightly better workflow so you can run 5–8 tapes at once instead of 2–3. That’s boring advice, but it works. Your time doesn’t really increase, throughput does.\n\nAnother option is raising prices slightly or adding “convenience” upsells. Faster turnaround, pickup/drop-off, better labeling, cloud + physical backup bundles. You’re not just selling digitization, you’re selling peace of mind and nostalgia, and people pay for that. Especially the same demographic you’re already serving.\n\nIf you want to keep it part-time, I’d avoid hiring or expanding too fast. Managing people and other people’s mistakes is what turns a chill side hustle into a headache. Keeping it small and reliable is a feature, not a flaw.\n\nThe biggest green flag here is that customers are emotional and grateful. That usually means you’re doing something right and you’re priced reasonably, maybe even a bit low. I’d optimize for calm, steady income and low stress rather than “scaling” in the startup sense.\n\nSometimes the best businesses are the ones that quietly print money and don’t demand your soul. This sounds like one of those.",

      "selftext": "**TL;DR:** I got laid off in late 2024, saw a post on this subreddit about ElevenLabs voice cloning, and thought \"why not.\" 13 months later, I have 8 AI voice clones earning me over $1,000/month while I sleep. This is the detailed guide I wish I had when I started. I'll show you exactly how to do it, step by step.\n\n---\n\n## The Real Numbers–No Clickbait Here\n\nLet me just get this out of the way:\n\n* **Total earned to date:** $8,985\n* **Current monthly earnings:** ~$1,160/month\n* **Number of voices:** 8\n* **Time invested per month now:** Maybe 1-2 hours (checking stats, occasionally tweaking things)\n* **Full portfolio breakdown PDF (with earnings screenshots):** [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QpjMjdh4MU4vIadC6ZjSYqKWwhF4Puf2/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nI'm sharing my actual numbers because I've seen too many low-effort posts on this sub that say \"you can make money with AI voices!\" and then provide zero details. That's not helpful. This guide is going to be long, but by the end, you'll know exactly how to do this yourself.\n\n---\n\n## My Story\n\nIn late 2024, I got laid off. Not ideal, but I suddenly had time to explore side income ideas I'd been bookmarking for months.\n\nI stumbled across a post on this very subreddit about licensing your voice on ElevenLabs. The concept was simple: record your voice, upload it to their platform, and get paid every time someone uses it for their projects (YouTube videos, audiobooks, apps, whatever).\n\nI have a background in audio engineering, so I figured I had a slight edge. But honestly, the technical barrier is way lower than I expected. If you can follow instructions and speak clearly into a microphone, you can do this.\n\nI created my first voice, and within a few weeks, I was making a couple hundred dollars. I immediately created another. Then another.\n\n**Here's what most posts don't tell you: the real strategy is building a portfolio of voices, not just one.**\n\nMy top-performing voice averages $308/month. But I have another that only makes $16/month. If I'd stopped at one voice and it happened to be the $16 one, I probably would've given up and told everyone this doesn't work.\n\nInstead, I kept going. Now I have 8 voices across different categories, and the portfolio as a whole is what makes this a legit income stream.\n\n---\n\n## What Is Voice Cloning? Let me explain.\n\nElevenLabs is an AI company that offers text-to-speech technology. Users can type text and have it spoken aloud by AI voices.\n\nHere's where you come in: ElevenLabs has a Voice Library where creators can upload their voice clones and license them to other users. Every time someone uses your voice to generate audio, you get paid.\n\n**Who uses these voices?**\n\n* YouTubers and content creators\n* Audiobook producers\n* App developers\n* Podcasters\n* Game developers\n* Businesses making training videos\n* People creating voiceovers for social media\n\nThe demand is massive and growing. AI-generated voiceovers are everywhere now, and people need high-quality, natural-sounding voices.\n\n---\n\n## What You'll Need Before Starting\n\n**The Essentials:**\n\n1. **A decent microphone.** You don't need a $500 setup. A solid USB condenser mic like the Audio-Technica AT2020 (~$100) or even the Fifine K669B (~$30) can work. The key is clarity, not expense.\n2. **A quiet recording space.** This matters more than your mic. A closet full of clothes actually makes a great recording booth. You want minimal echo and no background noise (no AC humming, no traffic, no roommates).\n3. **Basic audio software.** Audacity is free and works great. GarageBand if you're on Mac. I personally use Pro Tools, but that's overkill for this.\n4. **30+ minutes of high-quality audio.** This is ElevenLabs' minimum requirement for a Professional Voice Clone. More on what to record later.\n5. **An ElevenLabs Creator Plan.** That's $22/month ($11 for your first month with the 50% discount). This is your only ongoing cost. [More on this below]\n\n**Optional But Helpful:**\n\n* A pop filter (~$10) to reduce plosive sounds (harsh \"P\" and \"B\" sounds)\n* A mic stand or boom arm to keep positioning consistent\n* Basic knowledge of audio editing (removing breaths, normalizing levels)\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Set Up Your ElevenLabs Account\n\nHead to ElevenLabs and create an account. Here's my link: [https://try.elevenlabs.io/earn-with-voice-clones](https://try.elevenlabs.io/earn-with-voice-clones)\n\nIt takes you straight to the pricing page where you can grab 50% off your first month. If this guide saves you from the 13 months of trial and error it took me to figure all this out, using the link is an easy way to say thanks. I get a small kickback at no extra cost to you.\n\n**Important:** You need the Creator Plan (minimum $22/month after month 1) to create Professional Voice Clones. ElevenLabs has a free tier and a Starter Plan, but unfortunately you can't create Professional voice clones with either of them.\n\nAlso, here's something most guides don't mention: **Each Creator Plan account only allows ONE Professional Voice Clone.**\n\nThey offer a Business plan which allows up to 3 Professional Voice Clones, but they charge $1,320/month for that… ridiculous. I know.\n\nSo, if you want to build a portfolio like I did (which I highly recommend), you'll need to create multiple accounts. Each account is $22/month with the Creator Plan, but even a mediocre voice should earn enough to cover that cost within a few weeks. My worst-performing voice still makes ~$16/month, and most of mine pay for themselves many times over.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: The Most Important Part: Record Your Audio\n\nYou need at least 30 minutes of clean, high-quality audio. But here's what nobody tells you:\n\n**What you record matters as much as how you record it.**\n\nThe AI learns your voice patterns, inflections, and style from your recording. If you record yourself reading a novel in a calm, steady narration voice, your clone will sound great for audiobooks but weird for energetic social media content.\n\n**Match your recording to your intended use case:**\n\n| If you want your voice used for... | Record yourself... |\n|---|---|\n| Audiobooks / Narration | Reading fiction or non-fiction passages |\n| Podcasts | Having a conversational monologue |\n| Meditation / Relaxation | Speaking slowly and soothingly |\n| YouTube explainers | Explaining topics in an engaging way |\n| Character voices | Doing the character consistently |\n\n**Recording Tips:**\n\n1. **Stay consistent.** Same mic position, same distance, same room, same energy level throughout.\n2. **Avoid mouth sounds.** Stay hydrated. Do a few takes if you get clicky mouth sounds.\n3. **Leave room tone.** Record 10 seconds of silence (just the room) at the start. This helps with noise removal later.\n4. **Don't over-edit.** Light noise removal is fine, but heavy processing can confuse the AI. Keep it natural.\n5. **Aim for -6dB to -3dB peaks.** Not too quiet, not clipping. Audacity has a great normalizing feature for this.\n6. **Record more than 30 minutes.** I usually aim for 45-60 minutes of raw audio, which gives me 30+ minutes of clean, edited content.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Create Your Professional Voice Clone\n\nOnce you have your audio files ready:\n\n1. Click \"Voices\" in the left sidebar\n2. Click \"Create or Clone a Voice\"\n3. Select \"Professional Voice Clone\"\n4. Accept the terms\n\nNow you'll need to:\n\n**Name your voice.** Pick something memorable and fitting. \"Calm Sarah\" or \"Energetic Mike\" tells users what to expect better than \"Voice\\_Final\\_v2.\"\n\n**Write a description.** Be specific about what your voice is good for. Example: \"A warm, friendly American male voice perfect for explainer videos, podcasts, and corporate narration. Clear articulation with a conversational tone.\"\n\n**Add tags.** These are crucial for discoverability. Just click through the dropdowns to find the most relevant options for your voice.\n\n**Upload your audio.** You can upload multiple files. Make sure they total at least 30 minutes.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Verify Your Voice\n\nElevenLabs requires voice verification to prove you're uploading your own voice (not stealing someone else's).\n\n**Here's how it works:**\n\n1. ElevenLabs generates a random sentence\n2. You record yourself reading it\n3. Their AI compares your verification recording to your uploaded audio\n4. If they match, you're verified\n\nThis is where most people mess up. The verification is picky. Here's how to pass it on the first try:\n\n* **Do it right after recording.** Stuff like humidity, sleep, or too much coffee can change your voice tone just enough to mess up the verification.\n* **Use the exact same setup.** Same mic, same room, same distance, same position.\n* **Match your energy.** If your uploaded audio was calm, verify calmly. If it was energetic, bring that energy.\n* **You only get a few attempts.** Too many failures and you'll get locked out temporarily.\n\n**Pro tip:** If you're using audio processing (EQ, compression, etc.) on your uploaded recordings, you'll want that same processing on your verification recording.\n\nI use a free tool called BlackHole (Mac) to route my DAW's processed output back into the verification recording. This way, my verification sounds identical to my uploaded audio. If you're on Windows, VoiceMeeter does the same thing.\n\nOnce submitted, the voice takes 2-6 hours to process. You'll get an email when it's ready.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Create a Killer Voice Preview\n\nThis is your sales pitch. When users browse the Voice Library, they'll hear a short preview of each voice. You want yours to stand out.\n\n1. Go to Voices → My Voices\n2. Click the \"a\" icon to generate speech with your voice\n3. Create a preview that's 70-150 characters (aim for close to 150)\n\n**Two approaches:**\n\n**Option A: Speak directly to the listener**\n\n\"Hey there! I'm Jake, and I'm here to make your content sound amazing. Whether it's a podcast, YouTube video, or audiobook, let's create something great together.\"\n\n**Option B: Demonstrate your voice's purpose**\n\n\"The morning mist rolled across the valley as she opened the letter, her hands trembling with anticipation. Today would change everything.\"\n\n**Dial in the settings:**\n\nPlay with the sliders (speed, stability, exaggeration) and generate multiple versions until you get one that sounds natural and represents your voice well.\n\n**Important:** As of now, you can only use V2 voice models for previews. I've had the best results with \"Eleven Multilingual v2.\" I think it sounds closest to the original voice.\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Publish to the Voice Library\n\nTime to go live:\n\n1. Click the three dots (⋮) next to your voice\n2. Click \"Share voice\"\n3. Toggle \"Sharing\" to ON\n4. Toggle \"Publish to the Voice Library\" to ON\n\n**Note:** If you use a VPN, turn it off for this step. The sharing toggle sometimes doesn't appear with VPNs enabled. Weird bug, but it got me stuck for an hour.\n\n**Settings to configure:**\n\n* **Live moderation** prevents your voice from being used for adult content. Disabling it maximizes earnings potential (more users can access your voice), but it's a personal choice.\n* **Custom Voice Preview** is where you select your best generation from Step 5.\n* **Notice Period** determines how long existing users can keep using your voice after you remove it. Longer notice periods mean higher revenue share. I recommend 6 months or more.\n* **Submit your voice name.** Follow ElevenLabs' naming format. You can't change this later, so make it count.\n\nAfter submission, a human (I think) reviews your voice. During business hours, approval usually takes less than 24 hours. Weekend submissions might wait until Monday.\n\n---\n\n## Step 7: Set Up Payouts\n\nYou need to connect a bank account to get paid:\n\n1. Click your profile picture (top right)\n2. Click \"Payouts\"\n3. Click \"Create payout account\"\n4. Follow the prompts to set up Stripe Express\n\nPayouts happen weekly. You can watch your earnings accumulate in real-time on the Payouts page.\n\n**Tax note for US folks:** ElevenLabs doesn't withhold taxes. They'll send you a 1099-MISC at year end. Set aside money for taxes. I put away about 25-30% of my voice earnings just to be safe. You can also write off the subscription fees as a deduction, so make sure to keep receipts!\n\n---\n\n## The Strategy That 10x'd My Earnings\n\nOkay, you've got one voice live. Here's how to actually make real money:\n\n**Build a Portfolio**\n\nOne voice is a lottery ticket. A portfolio is a strategy.\n\nMy 8 voices span different categories:\n\n* Meditation / Calm (my top earner at ~$309/month)\n* Narration (2 voices, ~$120/month combined)\n* Conversational / Podcast (~$110/month)\n* Character voices (~$100/month)\n* ASMR (2 newer voices, too early to judge)\n\n**Why multiple voices?**\n\n* Different users search for different things. Your voice might be perfect for multiple categories, but each voice can only have one primary category.\n* Hedges your bets. If one voice flops, others might carry you.\n* Compounds over time. 8 voices earning $100/month beats 1 voice earning $300/month.\n\n**\"But I only have one voice!\"**\n\nNo, you have many. Try:\n\n* Different pitch ranges (speak higher, speak lower)\n* Different energy levels (calm vs. energetic)\n* Different speeds (slow and deliberate vs. quick and punchy)\n* Different personas (professional vs. casual vs. warm vs. authoritative)\n* Character voices if you can do them\n\nEach variation = new voice = new account = new income stream.\n\n**Reverse-Engineer What Works**\n\nBefore creating a new voice, I research:\n\n1. Go to the Voice Library \"Explore\" tab\n2. Search keywords for your intended niche (e.g., \"meditation,\" \"podcast,\" \"narration\")\n3. Look at the top-performing voices\n4. Study their names, descriptions, tags, and previews\n5. Note what they're doing well\n\nAsk yourself:\n\n* What keywords are they using?\n* How do they describe the voice?\n* What does their preview say/do?\n* Is this niche saturated or underserved?\n\nThen create a voice that fits the proven formula while adding your own twist. Don't copy, but definitely learn from winners.\n\n**Optimize Everything**\n\n* **Tags matter.** Use all the relevant ones. Think about what users would search.\n* **Description matters.** Be specific and benefit-focused.\n* **Preview matters.** Make those 150 characters count.\n* **Voice quality matters.** Better recordings = better clones = more usage.\n\n---\n\n## Realistic Expectations\n\nLet me be honest about what to expect:\n\n**Month 1:** You'll probably make somewhere between $10-50. Don't be discouraged. The algorithm needs time to surface your voice to users.\n\n**Months 2-3:** If your voice is decent and well-tagged, you should see growth. $50-150/month is reasonable.\n\n**Months 4+:** Things stabilize. You'll have a sense of whether a voice is a winner or underperformer.\n\n**My portfolio breakdown:**\n\n| Tier | Voices | Avg Monthly | % of Revenue |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Top performer (&gt;$250/mo) | 1 | $309 | 27% |\n| Strong ($100-150/mo) | 3 | $111 | 36% |\n| Moderate ($50-100/mo) | 1 | ~$100 | 9% |\n| Underperforming (&lt;$50/mo) | 1 | $16 | 1% |\n| Too new to judge | 2 | TBD | - |\n\nNot every voice will be a home run. That's fine. The portfolio approach smooths out the variance.\n\n---\n\n## Common Questions\n\n**Do I need professional audio experience?**\n\nNo. I have it, and it helps, but I've seen people with basic setups do well. Clean audio in a quiet room matters more than expensive gear.\n\n**How much time does this take?**\n\nUpfront: Maybe 2-5 hours per voice (recording, editing, uploading, optimizing). Ongoing: Almost none. I check my stats (and bank account) every few weeks. It's genuinely passive.\n\n**Is the market saturated?**\n\nThere are a lot of voices, but demand is growing fast. The key is finding your niche. Generic \"male narrator\" is crowded. \"Soothing meditation guide\" or \"energetic Gen-Z explainer\" is less so.\n\n**Can I do this outside the US?**\n\nYes! ElevenLabs pays creators worldwide via Stripe. Tax implications vary by country, so check your local laws.\n\n**What if my voice gets rejected?**\n\nMake sure your audio quality is good and your verification matches your uploaded content. I've never had a rejection, so I can't speak to the appeals process.\n\n---\n\n## Quick-Start Checklist\n\nIf you want to get started today:\n\n* Sign up for ElevenLabs Creator Plan\n* Set up your recording space (quiet room, mic, software)\n* Record 30-45 minutes of audio (match your intended use case)\n* Edit lightly (remove mistakes, normalize levels)\n* Create Professional Voice Clone\n* Pass verification (same setup as recording!)\n* Generate preview (max 150 characters)\n* Publish to Voice Library\n* Set up Stripe payouts\n* Repeat with new voices to build portfolio\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThis isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. It took me 13 months to get to $1,160/month, and I put real effort into building and optimizing my portfolio.\n\nBut here's what I love about it:\n\n* **It's genuinely passive.** I haven't touched most of my voices in months.\n* **It scales.** More voices means more income streams.\n* **Low startup cost.** $11 for your first month, basic mic, free software.\n* **Growing market.** AI voice usage is exploding.\n\n**Ready to start building your voice portfolio?** Here's my affiliate link: [https://try.elevenlabs.io/earn-with-voice-clones](https://try.elevenlabs.io/earn-with-voice-clones)\n\nYou get 50% off your first month and everything I learned in 13 months about turning this into $1k+/month. I get a small referral bonus. We all win. Seriously, good luck. Drop questions in the comments if you get stuck. I'll try to answer as many as I can.\n\nNow go make some money! 🎤\n\n---\n\n**EDIT (Day 4):**\n\nThis got way more attention than I expected, so here's some additional context that might help:\n\nThe PDF I linked includes actual screenshots—my ElevenLabs dashboard with earnings by voice, plus Stripe payout history. Probably should've made that clearer upfront. Click the link and scroll down to the Appendix (page 4) for screenshots of my actual earnings.\n\n[Report and Payout Screenshots Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QpjMjdh4MU4vIadC6ZjSYqKWwhF4Puf2/view?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm also not the only one doing this. u/liam_in_a_bubble mentioned in the comments they've made over $2k from a single voice. The opportunity is real.\n\nI uploaded two new voices this week. Within a few days, they've each made around $15, already covering the subscription cost. I'll post screenshots once they get their first payouts.\n\nA few people asked about voice ownership: You retain rights to your voice and can remove it anytime with the notice period you set. I've read through the TOS and feel good about it, but worth reviewing yourself before diving in.\n\nQuick update: 21 people have signed up through my link so far. Good for you! If any of you are working through the setup and get stuck, especially on verification or keywords, drop a comment. Happy to help.",

I eventually ended up just reading the script myself for tone and inflection but changing “my voice” to one in the eleven labs library that the client already liked. My question is…could you record 60 minutes of yourself, then alter it in another ai program (like changing my American male voice to a British female voice) then, use the same process for the verification step?

      "selftext": "I will give as many details as I can below. Ask me anything else.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rubzws7753eg1.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4da134a7771f0ed59fa2ea13b4666180bf34bc0b\n\nSince last year I've been growing brands online and making content. Particularly short form content on Instagram, YouTube and Threads. But Instagram I got the most traction.\n\nMy first Instagram page was on the motivational niche, I grew it in like 6 months to 20k followers. I didn't sell nothing.\n\nThen I grew a meme page to 40k followers in like 3 months. I sold a few physical copies (like 3 at most) of a satire book - it was trash and I didn't know what I was doing.\n\nThen I grew this last page to 45k followers in a month (started at the end of November 2025) and sold a bunch of copies and made $507 so far.\n\nThis page is about masculinity &amp; life advice for men. I sold an eBook and physical copy (with worldwide shipping) of this book. It's like a guide I honestly think will be helpful for men out there, it mixes storytelling, personal experiences and an actual system to help them sort life out. I wrote it myself and had some help of AI ngl.\n\nAs you can see I gradually learned how to grow a following overtime and I think this growth is luck to some extent but a lot of stuff I picked up by creating and growing the other mentioned pages.\n\nHere's some factors I think that helped me grow so fast: \n\n\\- I used the meme page to make a bunch of collab posts and blasted the new page on my stories which made me gain followers quicker.\n\n\\- I posted 10 reels per day. I only post 2 formats: AI animation with narration and some viral quotes with life advice. Rarely a carousel. \n\n\\- I tailored a lot of the content for virality, picking other viral quotes and text content and using as narration and overall repurposing shit that I saw worked on other pages.\n\nIn like 20 days I grew the page to around 30k, by now we are hitting 45k.\n\nI sell the digital book for 10. I sell also physical copiues (print on demand) of the book for 27. Which discounting production costs and shipping I net around 13. But people buy more the PDF.\n\nTools I use:\n\n\\- I created my own automation system using GitHub, Python, Meta API and a Google Sheet to post on Instagram. I store all my posts in a Cloudinary server (free account), then I add links in Google Sheets and store all metadata for the posts (such as caption). Each post is a row. Then I use FastCron to set cron webhook that activates my GitHub which picks these posts and uses Meta API to post automatically. This same automation posts daily stories for me. I am not tech savy, far from a dev, I built all this with ChatGPT and Claude and lots of experimentation. All this is done with free tools. It saves me a lot of time because I don't need to schedule anything, it automatically post for me.\n\n\\- I use Shopify to handle fulfilling of digital products and Lulu Direct (which prints on demand the book and does all the shipping) for physical copies. Shopify is like $19 monthly. Lulu I only pay fulfillment, production and shipping pretty much.\n\n\\- I built my own landing page using ChatGPT and Claude. I host it on Vercel. I bought the domain from NameCheap.\n\n\\- I am familiar with video editing. Did a video (VSL) for the landing page myself using Adobe Premiere - but you could do it on CapCut. Used Wistia to embed on the page.\n\n\\- I created my own Python script (again using AI) that edits video for me and adds subtitle and pretty much make the whole video editing process for me on the click of a button. This is how I am able to generate so many videos and post 10 per day.\n\n\\- I pay $6 on Digital Ocean to run my own server and n8n automation. All my DM automations are done on my n8n workflows. I use keywords on the posts to send links to people on DMs.\n\n\\- I use Telegram to post regular insights to my audience. I built a newsletter using n8n and Mailgun but haven't launched yet.\n\nThis is what I remember, I think that's it. Ask me if you wanna know more.\n\nWhy am I doing this? I am honestly quite isolated doing this, I don't got many friends showing interest in whatever the fuck I am doing online. \n\nI just wanted to share and get opinions. I want to give some help to people out there trying to start. I wish someone did the same to me. I want to find peers out there doing the same. That's it.\n\nWhat I will not do: I won't share the actual page, website or crucial info about my product that I think might reveal it. I think it's risky for me and the brand overall.\n\nI am already expecting people calling me a scammer or whatever. It sucks because, I am deadass tryna be helpful. I think my product is good and I am currently even improving it further because I am not satisfied with it. Plus I am literally considering selling some of these insights I just gave. I don't think you will find some of these workflows and shit I am doing anywhere, I built a lot of this stuff with lots of fuckups on my own. This is valuable insight.\n\nI have some background in marketing, have worked in digital marketing agencies, worked as a graphic designer and video editor. And I think I got a bunch of little things that made me achieve these results with a certain ease that most people wouldn't. I see a lot of people struggle to grow an audience, sell online and they just give up. I lowkey feel like I improved a lot, but deep down I also think I just got a natural ability with it.\n\nI don't want you to message me for details. I don't care if you do, but I can reply anything you want on the comments too. I am not trying to sell anything. I don't even open Reddit like that. I was just scrolling on this subreddit trying to find some other people selling products online, tryna get inspired because I am planning another product soon. Then I decided to share.\n\nI just saw a lot of skepticism and negativity too which I understand why people get skeptical with so many scammers out here. But I just wanted to bring a fresh no bullshit persepctive and be positive and share a bit of what I know. I think there's lots of ways to make money online nowadays and I see lots of people losing good opportunities because they think everything is a scam. I am here to help. ASK ME WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT. I see some people posting here and they be gatekeeping info. I am not - besides anything I find might compromise my brand and all that.\n\nSorry for any english mistakes, I am not native from an english speaking country either. I didn't revise this with AI. Happy new year and shit.",

I understand that most “passive” income requires upfront time, effort, or capital, and I’m fine with that as long as it’s something that can realistically scale and become more hands-off over time.  \n  \nI’m interested in hearing what has actually worked for people here while maintaining a normal 9-5 schedule. What income streams were worth the initial investment of time or money? Which ones ended up being more active than expected?  \n  \nI’m open to things like online businesses, digital products, investing, or other side hustles that can coexist with full-time work. If you’re willing to share, I’d appreciate details like how long it took to see results, how much ongoing maintenance is required, and any common mistakes beginners should avoid.",

          "body": "I'm in a similar boat, full-time job but I've managed to build up a few income streams on the side.  \nMy main passive income comes from dividend investing. I've been consistently putting money into dividend-paying stocks and ETFs over the past few years, and now I'm at the point where I'm getting a few hundred dollars quarterly without doing anything. The key was starting early and being consistent with contributions, even if they were small at first. It took about 2-3 years before it felt \"real,\" but now it genuinely requires zero maintenance beyond occasional portfolio rebalancing.\n\nFor semi-passive stuff, I also do side hustles when I have free time. I use Freecash to pick up some extra money during lunch breaks or when I'm watching TV. It's not life-changing money, but it's nice beer money for tasks that take minimal effort. The beauty of it is I can do it whenever I want, no commitment.\n\nMy advice: Start with something that requires minimal ongoing decisions (like index fund investing) and layer on active side hustles as your schedule allows. The combination has worked well for me because the passive stuff grows in the background while I can scale the active stuff up or down based on how busy work gets.  \nHappy to answer any questions if you want more details!",

Start with affiliative marketing for digital products. You don't need to create yours, people are selling these things for like $20, and give 45 to 65% commission to the affiliates You don’t need to create anything. You focus on traffic + messaging, and earn a cut per sale. Just message people inside facebook groups in the same niche or ask admins to post about your product.

          "body": "Honestly you already have the right mindset. Most so called passive income takes real upfront effort and only becomes more hands off later if you stick with it long enough.\n\nI work with a financial services firm called Revolution Financial Management and what I have seen work best for people with full time jobs is treating something new as a parallel build rather than expecting quick passive results. It is not instant and it is not hands off in the beginning, but it can realistically scale over time and become more flexible once systems and clients are in place.\n\nWhat tends to work well is starting it alongside a normal nine to five, setting clear boundaries on time, and letting it grow gradually instead of forcing it to replace income too quickly. Some people keep it supplemental long term and others eventually lean into it more once it proves itself.\n\nIt may be worth exploring alongside things like investing or digital products if your goal is something that can coexist with full time work and potentially become more hands off later. Happy to explain what it actually looks like in practice if you are curious. No pressure at all.",

Like templates, guides, or tools for a specific niche. Takes months upfront but then it just sits there and sells occasionally.\n\nDividend investing is passive but you need capital and the returns are slow unless you're putting in thousands.\n\nFor me personally, I make around $300 from survey stuff monthly but that's not really passive, just low effort during downtime.

So I would never suggest Etsy. It's also fickle, so I'd be in trouble if I depended on that alone.

Most side hustles are on the side because they don't give real pay the rent/mortgage type money. And all of them take a bit of time to develop.\n\nMy 'side hustles' that are fairly passive are things like Fetch Rewards and Evidation where you get points to exchange for gift cards. It isn't quick or steady money. \n\nThat's the biggest trouble with side hustles or working in ecommerce, you never know how much you will earn at any given time. It depends on trends, economy, how you present yourself/product, and how big of a social media following you can gain. \n\nI only mention all this because if you need the money to pay your bills, this isn't something to start now.",

Affiliate marketing is one, no inventory, low startup, but it does take learning and patience. Pinterest works especially well because content can drive traffic for months instead of days.\n\nDigital products are another good route if you have any knowledge or experience you can package into templates, guides, or simple resources. You create it once and sell it repeatedly.\n\nIf income is urgent, pairing something faster (freelance, VA work, local services) with a longer-term online strategy can take pressure off! \n\nWhatever you choose, I’d avoid anything promising “quick passive income.” The legit stuff usually takes effort upfront, but it does compound over time.\nAlways open to chat more!",

I saw a post on Reddit today (not sure which sub fortunately) of someone who rents out a large, ‘throne’ style chair for photo shoots at birthdays and baby showers.\n\nIt’s bulky and expensive enough to deter people from buying their own, and the OP was able to undercut their local competitors (ie lower rental and free delivery within a certain area). \n\nAlternatively I would try to leverage a niche skill that has local demand. I have a family friend who rents out enormous cooking pots to members of his community to cater weddings and celebrations. Commercial rental companies don’t stock the style of pots needed by his community, and they can’t guarantee that their equipment has only been used to prepare specific types of food. He runs the business out of his garage and it’s about as close to passive as you can get (ie customers pick up and drop off, pay online).",

I sell Canva and Notion templates on Etsy, Gumroad, and Creative Market.\n\nFirst 3 months were rough, made like $300 total. I was creating stuff I liked instead of what people actually wanted. Game changer was looking at what people searched for on Etsy and Pinterest.\n\nWhat worked:\n\nBundles sell way better than single products. A $27 bundle moves faster than a $7 template even though they take the same time to make.\n\nEtsy SEO isn’t optional. Boring but necessary if you want to be found.\n\nQuality over quantity. 10 good products beat 50 mediocre ones.\n\nWhat didn’t work:\n\nPinterest ads (wasted $200), daily Instagram posting (low conversions), lowering prices (attracts problem customers).\n\nNovember breakdown: $1,840 Etsy, $780 Gumroad, $420 Creative Market.\n\nStill takes about 10 hours a week for customer service and new uploads. Not truly passive but beats a 9-5.\n\n​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

I’m aware of Gumroad, but from a consumer standpoint, do everyday people who purchase digital goods actually go to Gumroad directly? Are they aware of the site and what it’s for?\n\nFrom a creator’s point of view, when I think of Gumroad, I think of it like other platforms where sellers list products, similar to Etsy. But I’m trying to look at it from a user’s perspective. Do people actually go to Gumroad and search for things, or is it mostly your job as the creator to bring in the traffic?\n\nI’m not saying this to be lazy I’m just genuinely curious. If you’re not actively driving traffic, do people actually browse Gumroad from time to time on their own?",

In that account, setup automatic purchases of some index fund (like VOO or VTI) in the amount you’re depositing.\n4. If you have extra money left over to invest, setup a traditional brokerage account and repeat steps 2 and 3.\n5. Go on living your life. Don’t look at those accounts again until you’re around 55.

You can outsource editing, script writing, thumbnails, and even channel posting and management. This means you just need to show up and film sometimes, which is pretty decent in terms of working hours I would say.\n\nIt's such a grind at the start, but it's also fun :) happy to answer any questions if you have any also!",

Pick one thing you can actually start this week and stick with it for a bit, $20 a week is very realistic if you keep it simple.",

She hired me and I signed my contract, went through all the tax information, and set up all my accounts. Tomorrow I start training but today I received my \"getting started\" email. One of the first parts of the troubleshooting portion said that a 100Mbps download and 5Mbps upload speed is required, mine is a good bit slower than that. They already checked my hardware, audio quality, and headset but never checked my internet speed. From people's experience do you think they are going to drop me during training after going through half a month preparing me or do you think they won't even check?\n\nUpdate: it wasn’t in issue. I got hired and started work.",

      "selftext": "Quick background: Started a niche site in September 2025 in a moderately competitive space (home office equipment reviews). This is my third site but the first where I'm seriously experimenting with social media as a traffic/authority driver alongside traditional SEO.\n\n\n\nWanted to share what I've learned so far about using social signals to help a new site gain traction faster.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The theory I'm testing:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nGoogle's helpful content update seemed to emphasize \"real\" sites with actual audiences vs pure SEO plays. My hypothesis: if I can build genuine social engagement around my content, it might send positive signals that help with indexing and initial rankings.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What I set up:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Created accounts on IG, TikTok, Pinterest, and YouTube Shorts\n\n\\- Each piece of content I publish gets repurposed into short-form social content\n\n\\- Goal: drive some initial traffic + build \"brand signals\" that Google might pick up\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The problem I ran into:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nStarting from zero followers on every platform meant my content was basically invisible. Even good stuff got like 50 views max. The chicken-and-egg problem is real.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What I tried:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Pure organic grinding\\*\\* (first 6 weeks): Posted consistently, engaged with others, used trending sounds/hashtags. Result: painfully slow. Got to maybe 200 followers across all platforms.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Engagement pods\\*\\* (weeks 7-8): Joined a few Discord groups for mutual engagement. Result: felt fake, took way too much time, and the engagement didn't seem to help reach.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Small paid boosts\\*\\* (weeks 9-12): Used a combination of platform ads and an SMM service (Crescitaly - it's an Italian panel that delivers pretty realistic-looking engagement). I'd give new posts a small push of 100-200 likes/views to help them get initial traction.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Results so far (Month 4):\\*\\*\n\n\n\n| Metric | Month 1 | Month 4 |\n\n|--------|---------|----------|\n\n| Social followers (total) | 200 | 2,400 |\n\n| Monthly social referral traffic | \\~50 | \\~800 |\n\n| Indexed pages | 8 | 34 |\n\n| Organic traffic | 0 | \\~150/day |\n\n| DR (Ahrefs) | 0 | 8 |\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What I think is happening:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nThe social traffic, even though it's small, seems to be sending positive signals. Pages that get social shares tend to get indexed faster. I also noticed a few natural backlinks coming from people who found my content through social.\n\n\n\nThe SMM boosts didn't directly help SEO (obviously), but they helped my social content get seen by real people who then engaged organically. It's like using a small paid push to unlock organic distribution.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What flopped:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Pinterest: Took way more effort than expected for minimal return\n\n\\- Trying to grow all platforms equally: Should have focused on 1-2\n\n\\- Over-boosting: When I tried larger boosts (500+ likes), the engagement looked suspicious and didn't convert to real followers\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Questions for the community:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. Anyone else experimenting with social as part of their niche site strategy? What's working for you?\n\n\n\n2. Do you think Google actually factors in social signals, or am I just getting lucky with timing?\n\n\n\n3. For those further along: did early social investment pay off long-term, or is it just a distraction from content/links?\n\n\n\n4. Is there an ethical line with using paid boosts to kickstart social? I go back and forth on this.\n\n\n\nHappy to share more details if anyone's interested. Still very much learning but wanted to document the journey.",

I also know the existing players in this market, but from what I can see, they’re not approaching Google Ads in a statistical, methodical, or science-based way.\n\n\nMy advantage is that I’ve worked in far more competitive markets before, and I can bring disciplined media buying, testing, and optimization skills into this space.\n\n\nThat brings me to my question: Is it still worth entering a market like this, even though the search volume is relatively low?\n\n\nOn one hand, there are larger markets where the same keywords might get 100,000+ searches per month, but competition is intense and most advertisers in that market know exactly what they’re doing when it comes to PPC campaigns.\n\n\nOn the other hand, this smaller market has lower search volume, but significantly less sophistication when it comes to Google Ads.\nI’m weighing the trade-offs:\n\n\nLarger market  has higher volume, higher competition, more advanced advertisers\n\nSmaller market has lower volume, weaker competition, more room to outperform. \n\n\nIs this type of market still viable long-term?

Like pressed flowers but for her crispy monstera that she killed. I honestly thought she was messing with me.\n\nBut she was dead serious (no pun intended) and offered to pay me $80 for it. I was like whatever, why not, had some saved money from Stаke set aside for random experiments anyway. Took me maybe 3 hours total including the framing. Posted a pic of the final thing on instagram just cause it looked pretty cool, got way more engagement than my usual posts.\n\nNext thing I know I'm getting like 15 DMs a week from people wanting the same thing. Turns out theres this whole guilt thing with plants where people feel bad throwing them away and want to \"honor\" them or whatever. Some interior designers started reaching out too because apparently dead plant art is having a moment??\n\nNow Im doing 20 to 30 of these a month at $95 each and honestly the margins are insane compared to selling live plants. No shipping stress, no dealing with weather delays killing inventory, and people are way less picky than with living plants. The community around it is also super engaged which helps with word of mouth.\n\nI still sell regular plants but this accidental thing is now my main income source and I barely advertised it.

Live plants have spoilage, shipping risk, seasonal demand, and customers get upset when things die. Dead plant art has none of that. You're basically selling preserved inventory with unlimited shelf life.\n\nAlso \"dead plant art is having a moment\" is the most 2024 sentence I've read in a while. But honestly it makes sense - people spend money on house plants because they want the aesthetic, not because they love caring for living things. You're selling the aesthetic without the maintenance burden.\n\nCurious how you handle the sourcing - are these all customer plants or do you ever buy \"dead stock\" from nurseries? Feel like there might be an angle there if nurseries are throwing away inventory anyway.",

      "selftext": "Started flipping luxury watches about a year and half ago. I started with 25k of my own capital from my day job. Eventually I put in up to about \\~70k of my own funds (owners capital) to grow the business. I started with no funding, no mentor, no one in the business and no courses. Lost 2k on my first 2 watches in 2024. Lost another 8k later that year. I mostly sell Rolexes and luxury brands. Nothing under 1k. Average watch price is around 10k.\n\n2024 - First 6 months:\n\n\\- 561k in sales\n\n\\- 22k gross profit\n\n\\- 13k net profit\n\n2025 - One year:\n\n\\- 1.2m in sales\n\n\\- 87k gross profit\n\n\\- 63k net profit\n\n\\- \\~8k payroll (salary to myself)\n\nIve been wholesaling pretty much everything. Fast flips. I aim for 6-12% margins, depending on how long I’m holding a watch. I’ve lost a few times, can count on one hand probably. I’m trying to get to a point where I’m making a consistent 10k / month net, after all expenses including my salary of 1k / month.\n\nI do some social media / marketing but very little. Trying to really focus on that this year so I can sell to more retail clients for a healthier margin. As well as buy more watches from retail clients.\n\nIt’s been really fun and I love watches and enjoy getting to wear them while I try to sell them. I still have my day job and don’t think I’m going to quit anytime soon.\n\nJust wanted to share this. If I missed anything or any questions just ask below. I’m going to try to post regular updates to track my progress and engage with others as I have never done it before. \n\nThanks!",

It can always work better faster, harder later.\n\nI stocked up a war chest for almost nine years.In my business. I just mastered the mundane and kept doing what was working.And didn't get fancy.\n\nWhen the new trump trade war started, I was able to drop a massive amount of capital on massive amount of inventory and avoid our tariffs jumping from the 25% we had been paying since 2018, to 100-150%.\n\nThis allowed us to keep our pricing the same. Last year, one of the other two manufacturers that supply our niche of commercial truck parts globally was absorbed by the other. Both were already 50% more expensive than we are, even though we have twice the profit margins. Once they completed the buyout, the company raised its prices another thirty to forty five percent!\n\nWe gained 127 new customers the first month after the buyout. For the last three months, we have seen double digit new customers coming on board. \n\nThe company that bought our other competitor is bleeding customers for this niche every day.\n\nWe recouped every dollar that we spent though.We did burn through what was supposed to be 24 months of inventory in just over 12. We have the cash flow, though, and we've already got 2 more inventory orders on the water that should arrive any day. Today I had five new customers.Come on board that were bleeding off of the competitor. \n\nWe did our first price increase in ten years on january first for 7%. We still dominate our market in pricing. And quality, and we still have almost 80% net profit margins with the new inventory lines coming in.\n\nI'd like biographies. Founder's Podcast is excellent.

The tension between scaling and safety is real though.\n\n\n\nOne thing that helped businesses I know navigate this: automating the processes BEFORE scaling. If you automate your core workflows now, you can actually scale revenue without proportionally scaling headcount or risk.\n\n\n\nThink about it - if you can automate 30-50% of your operational overhead, you can take on 50% more volume without hiring, which means less fixed costs and lower risk while still growing.\n\n\n\nBefore you and your cofounder compromise on strategy, map out which parts of your operation could be automated. That usually gives you a third option: scale with existing team + automation. Gives you growth without the risk exposure you're worried about.\n\n\n\nJust a thought, but it's honestly how a lot of profitable businesses approach scaling without burning cash.",

Know what you need to run the business as is now, know how much everyone needs to get paid to keep the lights on at home. The excess? This needs to be split into save &amp; invest. Save maybe 30-50% of this excess, then put away for taxes based on these savings (profit), then the rest is investment. \n\nYou’ve been slow and steady this long, don’t lose yourself on short sightedness now.",

I couldn't tell who was good until months of cash had already burned.\n\nhere is what i wish i knew earlier:\n\n**Too much jargon is a red flag.**\n\nGood developers explain their work simply. \"I added the password reset button. Now users get an email when they click it.\" While bad developers hide behind complexity. \"I refactored the auth middleware to handle session state.\"\n\nIf your dev leaves you more confused at the end of the conversation, that's not because you're dumb. It's because they're either hiding something or they don't truly understand what they built\n\n**Commit frequency matters even if you can't read code.**\n\nGo to your repo on GitHub. You don't need to understand the code. Just look at the patterns.\n\nIf you see multiple commits per week with clear messages like \"feat: added user profile page\" then that's good, while one giant commit every 10 days labeled \"updates\" or \"fixes\" is bad .\n\nKeep this as a rule of thumb: Small frequent commits = good habits. One giant weekly commit = poor planning or last-minute cramming.\n\n**\"Almost done\" is almost always a lie.**\n\nIf your dev always answers to your queries about what happened with : \"almost done\". they're either stuck and won't admit it, or they're actually not working.\n\nGood devs give specifics: \"password reset is done. email templates will be done in Thursday. Then I'll use two days to test.\"\n\n**The best developers push back on your ideas.**\n\nThis always keep surprising me. The devs who keep saying yes to every request are actually the worst. They weren't thinking, just billing\n\nThe best developer I ever hired regularly told me my ideas were wrong. \"That feature would take 6 weeks. What if we did this simpler version instead?\"\n\nThat's what you want. You don't want a mindless machine, but someone that will help you and correct you if you're wrong.\n\n**Weekly demos reveal everything.**\n\nStop accepting status updates. Ask your dev every Friday for a working demo of what he is working on. Even if it is still unfinished.\n\nGood developers love showing their work, but the bad ones always have an excuse for why they can't demo yet.\n\nBy the time your gut tells you something is wrong. You've already lost months.  \nWhat i found the most helpful is getting visibility earlier not until it's obvious\n\nWhat signals do you look for when evaluating developers? Curious what's worked for others here.",

      "selftext": "When I started my company, I was naive.\n\nI thought success and money would come fast.  \nSix months. Maybe a year.\n\nI believed that if the idea was good and I worked hard enough, things would line up.  \nThat investors were out there, waiting for founders like me to show up with the right story.\n\nThat belief didn’t come from nowhere.  \nSocial media makes entrepreneurship look fast, obvious, and rewarding, especially if you are willing to sacrifice a bit.\n\nReality was very different.\n\nEarly on, I met an entrepreneur who had been through a divorce.  \nI asked him about his journey and about the divorce.\n\nHe told me something simple:\n\n“Everything has a price.  \nIf you are not willing to pay it, you don’t get the reward.”\n\nAt the time, I understood the words.  \nI didn’t understand the depth.\n\nWhat I know now is that entrepreneurship doesn’t just test your skills.  \nIt tests how much uncertainty you can live with, and for how long, without breaking.\n\nIt’s lonely.  \nNot in a dramatic way.  \nIn a quiet, repetitive way.\n\nThere are very few celebrations.  \nJust an endless stream of decisions, doubts, and problems to solve.  \nEvery day.\n\nYou lose people along the way.\n\nNot because you become arrogant.  \nNot because you “don’t care anymore.”  \nBut because you stop building an acceptable life, one where responsibility is shared, and move toward a life where outcomes fall largely on you.\n\nYou stop drifting.  \nYou take control.  \nAnd once you do, there’s no one left to blame.\n\nThat mindset doesn’t stay at work.\n\nIt changes how you see relationships.  \nTime.  \nCompromise.  \nRisk.\n\nYou start operating with a level of intensity and accountability that not everyone around you wants or can follow.\n\nIn my case, this contributed to my divorce.  \nI couldn’t stay in a relationship that no longer worked for either of us.  \nThat choice came with real loneliness.\n\nI also used to believe entrepreneurship was about eventually sharing success with your family.  \nMore freedom.  \nMore time.  \nMore presence.\n\nWhat I didn’t anticipate is that the transition itself is costly.\n\nYou lose time before you gain any.  \nYou are less present than you’d like.  \nAnd the emotional margin shrinks long before the rewards show up.\n\nThere is something important I wish I had understood earlier.\n\nEntrepreneurship is not just hard.  \nIt is hard in a very specific way.\n\nIf you struggle with prolonged uncertainty,  \nif you need frequent reassurance,  \nif financial stress or ambiguity quickly destabilize you,  \nthis path can slowly erode you.\n\nNot because you are weak.  \nBut because not everyone is wired to operate for long periods without feedback, validation, or safety nets.\n\nAnd that is okay.\n\nThere is no shame in choosing stability.  \nIn preferring predictable income.  \nIn building a life with more emotional space.\n\nEntrepreneurship isn’t better.  \nIt isn’t braver.  \nIt is simply a different set of trade offs, and a very expensive one psychologically.\n\nI am not sharing this to complain or to glorify suffering.  \nI chose this path, and I still do.\n\nBut if you are considering it, be honest with yourself about the price.  \nAnd if you are already on it and feeling this weight,\n\nyou are not broken.\n\nYou are experiencing what this path actually demands.",

When I was in my early thirties, I almost gave up and chose stability. Find a large growing family and my wife wasn't on the same page with my long-term goals, and who I was as a person. After fifteen years it led to our divorce.\n\nAt absolute rock bottom in December 2016 I went out one New Years eve, broken, and ready for the end. I met my now wife that night just before midnight. We spent three and a half days talking. She told me to kick off bottom.She saw who I was deep down.\n\nIt made all the difference in the world. I thought maybe...\n\n2017 I started my business with literally nothing but my skills, knowledge, and enough spark to kick hard off bottom. I'd built companies over and over again that were very successful for the people that i've worked for over the years. I knew what to do, and I had a new energy to do it. I had nothing to lose and I had everything to lose.\n\nLooking back, I did believe within that first year we would break seven figures easily. We had a commercial truck part that had never been manufactured overseas. We chose higher grade materials, and we modified the designs to make installation a fraction of the time. I set the price at 50%-60% less than anyone else in the market. I made a 150-200 cold calls everyday except some Sundays for many many years consistently.\n\nLike you I slowly realized that it was definitely going to be a much longer journey. Those first four years we ate at food banks more than we ate at grocery stores. Well, at least my wife and I did. We let the kids eat the good stuff and they never knew.\n\nThe divorce dragged on for 6 long years. I changed my goal to wanting. Fuck you money so I could get better lawyers, specialists, and private detectives. I lost 2 daughters in that season and a son whom I was eventually able to find and reconnect with. I gained three amazing stepchildren. Lost a few people to covid. Almost lost the home five different times. Eventually, choosing to sell it, and buying an r v to live in. Cut all holidays and birthdays down to homemade gifts. Downsize everything out of our lives. Ran up hundreds of thousands in lawyer debts. \n\nThe struggles were what motivated me to work through it though. I couldn't sleep. I knew my kids were out there somewhere alive. A human is not built to successfully grieve a child that is missing but still alive.\n\nAfter my wife and kids were in bed, I would get out of bed and work until 2-4am at times. Not because I wanted to, but I couldn't sleep. Those days and weeks and months may have been what pushed us through those first four years. \n\nI wouldn't change any of it. We achieved the freedom of time, more control of our lives, touched countless lives with the resources we have built at the fuck you money stage. \n\nIt's not for everyone now.And that's okay. My biggest lesson that i've learned is you have to find bliss in the day to day.No matter what.",

If you want a slightly “faster” path to success, don’t go straight to building a business, build sales. Find your customer FIRST, with a sign up sheet and product mock ups. With cold calls or emails. With ads. Forget the overhead and LLC and all the irrelevant parts. Go straight to sales. Once you have proven that there are customers on the other side, ready, willing and able to pay for the product. Then, and only then, build a business.

          "body": "Thanks for sharing. You bring out a number of points that I certainly experienced as a two time entrepreneur. Maybe one of the most insightful and honest words about what it takes to be a real entrepreneur. What really hits home is:\n\n“Everything has a price.\nIf you are not willing to pay it, you don’t get the reward.”\n\nI started my first company as a spin off of another company that was sold. I had a partner who was the university-based founder of the first company. Plus, other key people from that company were investors in the spin off. I was CEO for 2 years and stepped back into a CTO role and my partner left the university to come on board as CEO. We raised over $70M, got in the pipeline to do an IPO, then 911 hit and the shit really hit fan. We ended up laying off 80% of our staff (many who were good friends).  We refocused on our core and took a few years to stabilize. We got new investors, my cofounder was pushed out, new management came in and the company was sold for 2-3 years later for $50M. I worked my ass off for 10+ years and only got about $300K out of the sale. I left shortly after, looked for job, couldn’t find one and decided to start a new company again.\n\nI moved with my wife and 12 year old son to a state where I didn’t know anyone. A fresh start. I licensed technology out of the local university and started a new company on my own. I did everything myself for a year and got some part time contractors to help (including key tech workers from the university). I got some early sales and had investors knocking on my door. I was trying to avoid taking any investor money, but I was burning thru my personal savings, so I decided to take on some investment. My goal was to raise as little as possible while getting sales. Ultimately ended of raising about $15M over an 8 years period and sold the company for nearly $100M. As the sole founder I did pretty well. \n\nAlong the way, I experienced many of the personal issues you mentioned. My wife left me because I just didn’t have time for her or my son. This still pains me nearly 20 years later. Eventually we reconciled and are doing well today, but the journey was extremely painful on a personal basis, but hugely rewarding from a business perspective.   I’ve been a board member, advisor, investor in a number of other startups and try to warn the founders of the personal pains they will experience, the commitment required, etc. Most just don’t make it, especially if they have something else they can fall back onto. \n\nBest of luck to you.",

I have also had a change in perspective of money and just this is putting a divide between me and people I know. \n\nBecause of this, I know what you say is true. Everything does in fact have a price.",

This is a pretty common positive side for almost everyone. But no has really talked about the negative and dark side of the journey. Let me start with mine. I started working at different startups to learn more about the industry and ecosystem. After a good years of experience, I started working on my own startup. It’s been two years, I’ve gone through depression, anxiety, not having enough runway, running out of money, almost becoming homeless, suicidal thoughts, no personal life, investor rejections, tons of refining my idea, solution based on problem space. Even at the initial stage, my customers insulted me and told me to shut down the project because it was a waste of time, money and resources. Later, I did self validations, improved myself, my idea, solution and learned more about my customers.\n\nPlease share your dark experience of being as a founder.",

Everyone tells you to work hard and that you have to grind because your competitors are grinding harder than you, but nobody ever talks about the importance of balance and not feeling guilty for not working hard all the time. I hope if any new founders are reading this, that you make it a focus to take care of yourself first and foremost, and never lose sight of what makes you happy, or your hobbies. The grind is not worth it, at least in my eyes. There are better ways to achieve your goals through a slow, methodical, and well thought out plan of attack.

Stuff people are already paying for, but complaining about complexity, price, setup time, or mental overhead. That usually shows up in support threads, Reddit comments, churn reasons, or people stitching together five tools to do one job.\n\nProduct Hunt is fine for pattern spotting, but it is rarely where the idea starts. The idea usually comes from watching how work actually gets done versus how the software claims it works. When you see repeated hacks, spreadsheets, or workarounds, that’s a signal.\n\nFor solo or small teams, I am also biased toward problems where speed matters more than perfection. If you can validate in weeks instead of months, you do not need the perfect idea. You need a tight loop between shipping, feedback, and iteration. Most clarity comes after you start, not before.",

For example: salt is cheap. Salt collected by hand from the salt pans of a small European island by Mr. XYZ whose family has been living across the street from the sea for generations. Wouldn't people pay a premium for that? Or, extra virgin olive oil pressed by the monks living in a remote monastery in Southern Europe with a production capacity of a few hundred litres a year. Just two ideas I came up with now.\n\n3. Social good. If I'm paying the same price as the big supermarkets and customer service is nothing special and the product is commoditised, I'd choose to spend my money with a company that invests in social good. Spend 1% of your revenue planting trees or installing solar panels or donate the money to funds fighting against big corporations exploiting animals/people/the planet.\n\n4. Underdog. As above. Some people choose to support underdogs. Tell your story. Why are you building this business? If the service/product is good, I will always support the underdog. For some of my purchases, I don't spend money with the bigger guys. Don't want to make the 1% richer.\n\n5. Package things. Anyone can buy a hammer, nails, a screwdriver, screws, etc... cheaply. But I don't know what I'll need to assemble a bed or fix the doorframe. Create a package. Assembly kit for product X. I'm happy to pay a small premium if you make my life easier.",

You build a great business by experiencing other people's problems and understanding the situation they are in, then adding your unique insights based on experiences that only you've had. \n\nDon't try to find an idea for a business. Try to just get out there, meet as many different people as you can, get yourself into as many different situations as you can, and eventually you'll come across a problem that needs to be solved and you'll see it with a unique insight that only you can see.\n\nAnd remember - even if other people can see the problem as you see it, very few people can actually build the business to solve it. So while you're out there experiencing the real world, simultaneously spend time to learn about business, marketing, sales, market economics etc etc so that you're prepared when the moment arises. \n\nGood luck. Be patient. Stop to find a business idea and start trying to help people anywhere and everywhere. You're muchl more likely to discover their greatest needs.",

      "selftext": "I've watched dozens of founders announce their fundraise over the past year. Most of them follow the same playbook: write a LinkedIn post, maybe a Twitter thread, attach some founder headshots, thank their investors, and call it a day.\n\nThey get 50 likes. Their investors comment. A few friends reshare. And then it's gone.\n\nMeanwhile, a handful of founders treat their fundraise like a marketing moment and the difference in outcomes is wild.\n\nWhy does this even matter?\n\nHere's what most founders don't realize: a fundraising announcement isn't just \"news.\" It's one of the only moments where you have a legitimate reason to be loud. You have something to say. People expect you to share it. And if you do it right, you're not just announcing money. You're doing three things at once:\n\n1. Building credibility. When your announcement gets traction, future investors see momentum. It makes the next round easier. The halo effect is real.\n2. Driving signups. A viral fundraising moment doesn't just impress VCs. It brings in users who were on the fence. People want to be part of something that's clearly working.\n3. Creating leverage. When everyone's talking about you, recruiting gets easier. Partnerships open up. Press reaches out. You're suddenly on people's radar.\n\nBest example I've seen: Arlan Rakhmetzhanov dropped a cinematic video recreating that famous scene from The Social Network. It hit 2-3 million views across LinkedIn and X. Investors reached out. Other founders started talking about him.\n\nThe money matters. But the attention you get for free might matter more.",

Equity in the whole company vs just a route/book of clients.  \n\\- How profits are calculated (gross vs net, what expenses come off the top, owner salary).  \n\\- Decision rights (pricing, hiring, equipment purchases).  \n\\- What happens if one of you wants out (buyout formula, non-compete, client ownership).  \n  \nAlso: measure your real contribution. If you’re the one doing the work + retaining customers, you have leverage.  \n  \nTactical tip: build your own “operations dashboard” so you’re not negotiating blind. I’ve seen people use Manus (AI no-code web builder) to set up a simple full-stack internal tool: a database of clients, job history, and margins, with authentication so only you/your boss can access it. You can even add Stripe integration for deposits or recurring plans if you ever spin off. Having clean numbers (not just “I hustle hard”) changes partnership talks.  \n  \nNot legal advice, but if the offer is real, a fair contract + transparent bookkeeping protects both sides and keeps the hustle from turning into resentment.",

I help manage my wife's dental practice and we have seen a huge spike in patients finding us via AI overview mentions on Google and ChatGPT! Earlier it was mostly just google map and google searches!\n\nIn my experience, it's very similar to doing traditional SEO. Except the mapping is not one on one! But just improving our SEO helped with our AI visibility as well! We are basically the default answer for various queries in our locality. Specially here are everything we have been doing that seem to work\n\n1. Active Google Business Profile: If you are a local business, ensure your Google business profile is setup correctly with latest info, photos etc. Also ensure all your customers leave great reviews on there! Rate of new reviews seem to help more than total number of reviews\n2. Write Hyperlocal/specific blogs on your website: One thing that has immensely helped is writing hyper specific (and if local, hyper local) content on your website as blogs around topics your customers are already searching for on Google or asking AI. We have been publishing a blog every Monday! These days with AI tools like Frizerly, most of these are automatable as well! Just ensure it's plugged into Google search console so that it has the right data to work with!\n3. Get mentions and backlinks: Well earlier it was links that mattered but now it seems like just having your business or brand mentioned by relevant websites matter! There are many ways to do this like guest posts, signing up for local events, sponsoring events or you can even just pay and get PR! There are many services like Einpresswire that you can search around for this as well!\n4. Make sure your website is not broken: Last but not least, your website loads correct and quickly on all devices and phones and has a sitemap etc! These days most modern website builders like wordpress etc have most of SEO baked in, so you dont really have to over-invest! Just do a quick audit and ensure nothing is obviously broken!\n\nAnd that's about it! Hope this helps :)",

      "selftext": "So me and my gf are two teenagers living in South Asia (Bangladesh). We’ve been together for over 2 years. We’ll both be turning 18 this year, and due to cultural pressure, she will most likely be getting forced into marriage after she turns 18.\n\nBut we want to break the chain. So even if our family tries to force us do something against our will, we can simply live separately by handling our own expenses.\n\nFor this reason I have entered entrepreneurship a little over a year ago, trying to build financial independence and I haven't been quite successful with it yet.\n\nMy gf can’t contribute directly because of cultural restrictions. After household chores, she barely even gets time to study. Business or entrepreneurship is completely off limits for her given her family restrictions.\n\nDespite all this, I’ve noticed something important about her. She manages to take sunset and nature pictures as like she got this attraction with clicking pictures. She’s also a space enthusiast, so she often stays up late to capture events.\n\nUnfortunately, she doesn’t have a camera, so the quality of the pictures isn’t great.\nThe main reason for me telling all this is because she told me she wants to contribute to our goals. But since she can’t directly work on business or entrepreneurship, she wants to do it through things she’s already allowed to do. \n\nSo she asked me if we could utilize her photography to earn money and scale. And honestly, I have no idea if that’s even possible, so I’m asking here for guidance.\n\nI’ve also noticed she’s a big enthusiast of storytelling. She’s currently writing a novel (at least that’s what she told me), and it’s genuinely good. I’ve read a few pages she managed to write (she can’t spend much time on it), and the story impressed me. I think she could potentially use this skill too.\n\nOverall, I want to know whether her skills (photography or writing) can realistically be used to earn money, even at a small scale given our constraints. If any experienced people have some advice for us, we'd genuinely appreciate.",

However, if you have a phone and wifi you could potentially do social media and I think that is the most honest path. Someone suggested writing stories for kids but if you are selling a physically book that means you need a manufacture and that is expensive so your next option would be making a digital book but the issue is also promoting your \"brand\" or books so it gets attention. Hence, you would ultimately need social media either way but I do not know the market and current situation in Bangladesh so I cannot provide you much of a plan without any extra information",

And it doesn't need to be super high quality photos, a lot of people like to see real life. And considering South Asia, the landscape is totally different from the American, this may be a good advantage.\n\nI wouldn't discard other social medias, once you have one picture, you can post it everywhere and see what happens.

A lot of people would keep this bottled up.\n\nOne thing I want to say gently is that earning money doesn’t have to mean turning a talent into a “business” right away. Especially under constraints like the ones you’re describing, the most important thing early on is safety, predictability, and not adding pressure to something that already matters emotionally.\n\nPhotography and writing can absolutely be meaningful skills, but they usually compound slowly. Expecting them to solve urgent financial independence can quietly turn something she enjoys into another source of stress. That’s not a failure on either of your parts, it’s just how those paths tend to work.\n\nWhat is realistic is treating her interests as something that can be practiced quietly and consistently, without needing permission, exposure, or scale. Even improving skill, building confidence, or having a small creative outlet can matter long before money enters the picture.\n\nFor you, the most leverage early on often comes from finding income paths that are boring, allowed, and controllable, even if they aren’t exciting. Stability buys time. Time makes everything else easier.\n\nYou’re asking the right questions, and you’re being thoughtful about her situation. Just don’t let urgency force either of you into carrying more weight than is fair right now.",

You could have her quietly hone in on that, offering creatively written stories, company blurbs, and self-published fiction books. Really sell that storytelling capability; she has quite a few options as a “storyteller.” \n\nI’m a writer myself, and I found early success that same way by tapping into the pen.  \n\nBecause in truth you don’t need much to write; you just need your thoughts and something to write with, and you obviously have access to the internet (not sure if she does), so at least one of you could push out her offerings to the public.  Further pushing her on self-publishing platforms to ensure you two get all the funds necessary rather than sharing them with 40 parties had you sought out a professional publisher.",

Electronics production hit $135B (₹11.3 lakh crore) last year, and we are the 2nd largest mobile manufacturer in the world. On paper, it looks like a revolution.\nBut in my studio, the reality feels different.\nThe issue is that while the \"Production\" numbers are up 6x, the local value add is stuck at like 15-20%. That means for every \"Made in India\" phone, ~85% of the value is still just imported parts that we screw together here.\nI dug into the trade data to see if I was just imagining it, and it’s actually getting worse in some areas:\nOur imports from China almost doubled between 2017 and 2024 (hit ~$129B).\nWe still rely on them for 94% of our Li-ion batteries and 88% of ICs.\nThe bottleneck isn't talent.\nThe issue I face daily is speed vs. compliance. If I’m in Shenzhen, I can get a complex PCB prototyped and assembled in 3 days. Here, I spend that same time just waiting for a specific sensor to clear customs or dealing with BIS certification paperwork.\nI’m trying to solve this for my clients by handling the end-to-end mess for them, but it’s an uphill battle.\nI’m curious to hear from other hardware founders here: What is the actual blocker for you?\nIs it that you literally can't source the components locally, or is it that the BIS/Customs headache just makes it not worth the effort compared to importing white-label stuff?",

Showing up consistently and being genuinely helpful beats any clever funnel early on.\n\nReddit in particular rewards patience. The moment you treat it like a traffic source it stops working. When you treat it like a place to learn in public and help people, the right ones eventually ask what you are building. That 1 in 10 comment conversion you mentioned feels very real.\n\nThe DM thing is underrated too. Asking people what they are actually trying to do instead of pitching immediately builds trust fast and saves you from building stuff nobody wants.

          "body": "Congrats on having $3k at 17! That is a massive head start.\n\n\nIf you want to build wealth, I would put it in the S&amp;P 500. \n\n\nIt's the safest investment option that makes money each year at a predictable pace. Aka, you do not need to be an expert and you will still make money. \n\n\n\n\nAnd what's fantastic for you is that you're young and time is on your side to have that $3k grow into a potentially massive sum.\n\n\nThink of the S&amp;P 500 as a massive basket containing the 500 biggest, most successful companies in the US (Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.). Instead of betting on one company (which could fail), you’re betting on the entire US economy.\n\n\nIt’s \"Self-Cleaning\": If a company starts failing, it gets kicked out of the basket and replaced by a better one automatically. You don't have to do any research; the index does the \"hiring and firing\" for you.\n\n\nRelatively Safe: This is about as safe as any choice because if the 500 biggest companies in the country fail, the entire economy has collapsed. At which point we’d all have much bigger things to worry about than money.\n\n\nBetter than Single Stocks: While you could try to pick one \"growth stock\" to beat the market, it takes hundreds of hours of research and most people still fail (this has been proven over rnad over, you can look it up). The S&amp;P 500 gives you similar growth with no effort after the initial set-up. \n\n\nThe market historically returns about 10% per year on average. \nIf you invested the $3k now, by 27yo you'd have:\n\n\n$3,000 alone: You'd have roughly $7,800.\n\n\n$3,000 + $50/mo: You'd have roughly $18,000.\n\n\n$3,000 + $100/mo: You'd have roughly $28,200.\n\n\n$3,000 + $200/mo: You'd have roughly $48,500.\n\n\nAnd so on and so forth. You can see how quickly the numbers grow as you add more money each month.\n\n\n\n\nYou can have fun playing around with an \"compounding investment calculator\". Just Google it, or ask AI. \n\n\nIf you keep investing each month, even small amounts, those will compound. Compounding means your interest (what the stock earns) earns its own interest, which multiplies your gains exponentially over time.\n\n\nOk so, you don’t buy \"The S&amp;P 500\" directly. You buy a fund that tracks it. The most famous \"tickers\" (symbols) are VOO or SPY.\n\n\n 1. Open an account: Use a reputable brokerage like Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab, or Robinhood.\n\n\n 2. Buy VOO: I recommend VOO over SPY because it has lower fees. \n\n\n 3. Buy and Hold: Buy as much as you can and do not touch it. I repeat... DO NOT TOUCH IT. People will panic when the market drops. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM. They are acting foolishly and impulsively. NEVER EVER SELL when the market is dropping. YOU WILL REGRET IT. This is why you are investing in something like VOO. Because you do not have to worry about the market dropping. It will come back up, and again, if it doesn't, that means the entire US economy has collapsed and we're screwed lol. Oh, and also, if you seel, you will need to pay taxes on what you sell. So keep that in mind.  \n\n\n4. Feed the Machine: Go make more money in the real world from your job or business and funnel a portion of it each month into your VOO.\n\n\nP.S.: For the love of God, please do not day trade. I know it's everywhere and everyone is talking about it, but you will be throwing your money away. The people marketing day trading make their money from marketing, not trading. To actually win at it, you need the same tech as big hedge funds and hundreds of hours of data analysis. You will make more money just buying and holding.\n\n\nP.S.S.: Your Future Self. If you really decide to get into investing and set yourself up for a future where your stocks pay your bills, look into Blue Chip Dividend Investing once you’ve built a large \"pile\" of wealth (usually in your 40s or 50s). For now, focus on growing that pile as big as possible with VOO.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Put the $3k in VOO, add a little every month, and let the top companies in the world work for you while you live your life.\n\n\nGood luck! ",

Back in September this guy starts booking us for small jobs, maybe twice a month, always different locations. Nice enough dude, asks a TON of questions though. Like what products we use, how we price square footage, what our turnaround times are, stuff like that. I figured he was just one of those detail oriented clients.\n\nRecently I'm at a local business networking thing and someone mentions they just hired a new cleaning company. I ask who and its literally this same guy. Turns out hes been running his own cleaning business the whole time, just started it in August. All those \"jobs\" he hired us for were him basically taking notes on our entire operation.\n\nHe even asked me once about our employee retention and I told him we give small bonuses when we hit quarterly goals because it keeps people motivated. Now Im wondering if he copied that too. The whole thing has me stressed and Im glad I at least have some money saved aside from Stаke personally because I might need to pivot some things if he starts undercutting us.\n\nPart of me wants to be annoyed but I dont know if I can even do anything about it? Like he technically paid for services so its not illegal or anything. But it feels shady as hell. Should I just let it go or is there something Im supposed to do here?",

What he can't copy is your reputation, your existing client relationships, and whatever operational muscle memory your team has built over years. A new company with your playbook still has to earn trust from scratch.\n\nIf anything, I'd lean into what makes you sticky with clients rather than worrying about him. Review your accounts, identify the ones that are genuinely loyal vs price-sensitive, and make sure those relationships are solid.

He paid for services, asked questions during those services, and started a business. Annoying? Absolutely. Actionable? Not really.\n\nWhat you CAN do is focus on what's harder to copy - your relationships, your reputation, your retention. He can copy your pricing spreadsheet but he can't copy the trust you've built with clients over years. And if he's undercutting on price, that's usually a race to the bottom anyway. You don't necessarily want the clients who'll jump ship for 10% off.\n\nAlso worth noting: new cleaning businesses have a pretty high failure rate. The operational complexity hits people hard once they're actually running payroll, dealing with no-shows, managing callbacks. Give it six months and see if he's still around.",

      "selftext": "I've been doing web development for about 4 years. Back in March I landed a restaurant owner who needed a simple website menu, hours, contact form, maybe 10 pages total. $2,500, signed contract, everything by the book. First month goes great. He's responsive, sends assets on time, compliments the work. I'm thinking this is the dream client. Then the site launches and the \"quick questions\" start. \"Can you just add a reservations button?\" Sure, 30 minutes, I'll throw it in. \"Can you make the menu downloadable as a PDF?\" Fine, easy. \"Can you add a little animation to the header?\" Okay, getting annoying but whatever. By month two I've done maybe 15 of these \"quick\" things. I finally sit down and add it up 12 hours of extra work. At my rate that's $600 I just gave away for free. So I send him a nice email explaining that future changes will be billed hourly, gave him my rate, even offered a discount because we had a good relationship. He loses it. Says I'm \"nickel and diming\" him. Says a \"real professional\" would stand behind their work. Says he thought we were \"building something together.\" I tried to explain the original scope was delivered months ago but he just kept saying \"it's the same website though.\"\n\nYesterday he left me a 1-star Google review saying I \"surprised him with hidden fees after the project was done.\" The thing that kills me is I don't even think he's being malicious. He genuinely doesn't understand that what he asked for was extra. In his head, he hired me to \"do his website\" and the website isn't done until he says it's done. I should have had this conversation after the second or third request. Instead I stayed quiet trying to be the \"chill\" freelancer and now I'm the bad guy. How do you even explain scope to a client who doesn't think in those terms? Or do you just avoid these clients entirely?",

That scope covered the design and delivery of the site as specified, and the project was fully delivered and deployed on \\[date\\].\n\nAfter delivery, you requested a number of additional changes that were outside the original project scope.

          "body": "My solution to this problem with clients works every time.\n\nStep 1: have client send links to sites similar to what they want their site to look like and similar to the contents they envision. Tell them to group the links by (a) sites with color schemes they like, (b) with layouts they like, and (c) content and content organization they like.\n\nStep 2: set up a 15 minute zoom call to go through the sites they provide so you have an idea for layout, color and mending. Keep it to 15 minutes, you are training the client to be concise.\n\nStep 3: create 3 mock-ups. I call them mentally bare-bones, expected choice, and kitchen sink. But I describe them to the client as entry level business profile, typical feature informational website, and custom professional website. Price differential should be very wide, like $800, $2,200 and $25,000.\n\nStep 3: give them a process timeline and a build analogy. I use a home building metaphor which goes \"We first draw the blueprint, and you can make any change at that point such as different layout, menus, number of pages or sections, features, etc. Then we lay the foundation which is where we register the URL, build the menus (plumbing), lay out each page (rooms). Then we complete the look and feel with text and images (finish carpentry and flooring.)\" You do this to be able to say \"remember, i told you there is no charge to change the site layout during 'blueprint' phase, but we are now at the finish stage and the change you are asking for takes us back two stages, so it will be expensive to do this as we have to tear up the pipes and cement. I will give you a price quote for that change.\"\n\nThis works for me. When they jump to \"hey, we really need to add a blah-blah-widget\" you can say \"Great! That was one of the features I suggested in my proposal for a professional level site! Should I go ahead and give you a quote for that addition?\"",

You should have already, after 4 years, addresses the cut off time for included updates, and the cost for additional updates and the cost. Be clear about maintenance going forward. Ask if they want a pre-paid retainer or to do it by the item.\n2. You basically punished them for making updates and failed to provide CLEAR information about future updates. It can feel like getting nickel and dimed.\n3. You offered to do the work free - you started the problem.\n4. In consultations, I say something like: \"The website is done. You pay the final invoice. A month goes by and you want to update the site. Depending on what you need, the maintenance cost is this, this, or this. You can do it hourly, or purchase a discounted update pack for a group of changes, or a retainer for regular updates.\"\n5. If a client doesn't understand what's extra, that's a failing on your part. It needs to be in writing and it needs to be initialed and it needs to be communicated several times, and you need to get an answer on how they plant to manage the site going forward.\n6. You can offer a monthly update for XYZ dollars and it might include (5) updates and you list those updates. Major functionality like a reservation system with a mobile app, or getting DoorDash functionality, etc. All the updates requested above, I'd do in a monthly maintenance session for $55 - about 20 minutes of work usually. Adding a menu PDF is problematic, the menu changes, add a solution where they can make updates to the menu and a \"Print PDF\" is automatic.\n7. There are tasks as Webmaster that are included in their annual hosting/domain renewal - things like new email addresses, backups, restore, etc.\n8. I took a lot of lumps when I started my brand and web development company. Each issue with a client taught me how to be smarter with the next.\n9. I made a lot of areas self-manageable and offered to train them or an employee. I also included a user guide with easy steps to update a page or add a page.\n10. All these things they are asking for should have been offered anyway. Go ahead and add these items to your offerings for restaurants.\n11. I also make them complete an online form in their account, for requesting updates. They check boxes for what they want done, and it indicates \"included in current maintenance plan\" or \"additional fees\". If they go over a certain amount, it adds fees. One client dumped me because he wanted to text me at all hours and I told him I don't do business by text. Log in to his account and submit requests - there needs to be a record. He came back after a while.\n12. It sounds cliche, but an educated customer is your best customer - you have to educate them.\n\n**Good luck next time. As for the 1 star, if you're able to respond:**\n\n&gt;\" Nicks Cafe is a valued client and we are proud of the work we were able to do in launching their new web site. The contracted and paid web design phase was for 6 weeks. Once the site launched, any updates are billed either hourly or through a maintenance plan. Any errors or loss of functionality, we correct at no charge, but new pages, new features, or changes or deletions, are billed items. We apologize that the maintenance costs were not understood. We welcome the opportunity to make it right by offering a discounted 1 year maintenance plan. We have reached out to Nick with this offer.\"\n\nFigure out what deep discount you can offer to save your reputation and reach out to the client. For me, it's worth it to even give him a set amount of updates per month for a year at $100. The business you lose is infinite. Be sure to come up with a pricing plan for 2027 that keeps him happy after you see what he requested in updates this year. I also use clients like this to try out new features I install free. Then when it's tested, I can actively market it and point to them as a LIVE example.\n\nA lot of people are telling you to snark, but it's partly your fault for not being clear. If you value customers who put food on the table, be kind, but be firm and professional. My business was 99% word of mouth. Not one client in my portfolio would say a bad word about me. Do whatever it takes to make it right - within reason - and fine tune your contracts and communication about price.\n\nIn freelancing, when there's a problem, take a look a how you failed. If it's not in writing, it's you. DM me and I can share some CRM solutions that help you manage clients and costs and requests.",

The ideal solution would be not to bill on hours -- for **this** contract/website. *In his mind*, he didn't agree to an hourly rate, or sign off on menu items, so they feel like tack-ons, and he has no out but to settle on a subpar website. In his mind, it feels like being taken hostage -- he can keep paying more and more at a rate he didn't necessarily agree to pay, to reach a complete website; or he can accept a subpar website. Neither solution is really palatable to him, so maybe he felt no other escape but an angry review.\n\nSolution: In the next contract, either break down 'website' further into individual items (button == X, subpage == Y, copy edit == Z, ...) or just spell out the hourly rate for add-ons.\n\nFrom your standpoint, what you can do to recover those lost/unbilled hours is to charge a higher hourly rate on this next contract. So over time, you break even again and even go higher. But don't damage the client relationship by nickel-and-diming. You have a right to your time, but acknowledge his feelings, turn him positive by saying you'll do it for free **for this website** \\-- and then just spell out hourly rates or a menu of items in the next contract. You'll make a fan out of him and come out ahead, plus he won't leave that review.\n\nAt this stage, maybe you can ask for him to remove the 1-star review in that next contract.\n\nThis is how I've done it. I've been on both sides. His feelings are sound. So are yours. Just take the loss on this one contract, then apply your adjusted expectations to the next one -- or walk away. Think long-term. You want happy clients. Guys who are noisy 1-star reviews are also noisy in 5-star praise. So turn him into the 5-star guy by swallowing your ego, acknowledging his feelings, and then playing for the next contract, with much more specific breakdowns and a favorable hourly rate.

So every new idea still feels like “the same website” to them.\n\nWhere things usually go wrong (and you already spotted this) is silence. Each “quick favor” silently resets their expectation of what’s included. By the time you bring up billing, it feels sudden to them — even if it’s completely reasonable.\n\nWhat’s worked better for me over time:\n\n* Define the scope in **plain outcomes**, not technical tasks launch-ready site with X pages; post-launch changes billed.\n* Introduce the concept of paid changes **early**, even if you waive the first 1–2 small ones. That sets the mental model.\n* Frame it as a **process**, not a fee: “After launch, all changes go through a small change request so nothing breaks.”\n\nAs for avoiding these clients — you usually can’t. Restaurants, small businesses, first-time website owners often think this way. The real filter isn’t the client; it’s whether you enforce boundaries *before* resentment builds.\n\nThe Google review hurts, but honestly, most experienced freelancers reading your story will recognize it immediately because we’ve all learned this lesson the same way.",

Last year I landed this marketing agency that became my anchor client steady projects, $1,000-1,200 a month, super professional, paid within 48 hours every time. I'm thinking this is what sustainable freelancing looks like. Around November they tell me their business partner is launching a new venture and needs a developer. \"You'd be perfect for this, they're great to work with, we've been in business together for 6 years.\" I take the referral because of course I do. Good client vouching for someone, easy decision. First call with the referral and I can already tell something's off. Vague about requirements, keeps saying \"we'll figure it out as we go,\" but I push through because I trust my original client's judgment. Project starts and it's a nightmare. Constantly changing scope, wants daily updates, questions every decision, rude on calls. \"Why is this taking so long?\" \"I found a template that does this in 10 minutes.\" \"My nephew said he could build this.\" I'm bending over backwards trying to make it work detailed documentation, extra calls, revisions I'm not charging for. Two months in I finally realize this isn't going to get better. I send a professional email saying I don't think we're the right fit, offered to transition everything to another developer, even gave them a partial refund for the hassle. They lose it. Email my original client saying I \"abandoned their project\" and \"wasted their time.\" Suddenly my anchor client is cold. \"You made me look bad in front of my partner.\" \"I vouched for you.\" Haven't gotten a new project from them since. It's been two months.\n\nThat referral didn't just cost me one bad client, it killed a $10K/year relationship I spent a year building. The thing that kills me is I don't even know what I was supposed to do differently. Keep working with someone who made every day miserable? Or stand my ground and lose my best client anyway? How do you handle nightmare referrals from good clients without torching the relationship? Or do you just never take referrals?",

If you need time to decide what you want or what you need that's fine, and if you change your mind while we work we can stop and I'll quote out the changes and upon your approval of the new quote I'll continue. However if you're unwilling to define exactly what you want I can't then appropriately quote and charge you for the work.\"\n\nThen demanding to set his expectations before you guys started and if he couldn't have that then cut it off before it started. \n\nThings like \"now we have the exact scope of the project you want, it's gonna cost 5000 and take 12 weeks.\" I personally always pad the time I actually think it's gonna take, for mechanic work I like to give myself an extra hour so I look good when I finish under that or when I encounter problems unplanned for it's not quite so bad when I tell the customer I need more time cause this bolt was rusted and this one broke off etc.\n\nFinally with the daily updates I would have told him \"Sir you're not my only customer, I'll have your work done in the time frame I gave and I can provide a once a week update as I have other customers and some days I might be working on their projects and some days I'll be working on yours so daily updates won't be productive and just cost me time I could be using to work on your project to tell you \"I coded some letters\".

Then you take those and use them to point out and rejustify your value to him. \n\nWhile there are plenty of Karen and obnoxious ass hats I find you can either put them in line with strict procedures and rules while setting expectations clearly ahead of time or they will say \"Well I don't like that\" and you simply reply with \"Well I'm not the only web designer on the planet, if you want someone else to do this project who will give you daily updates you can find someone else who will as I am probably just not the right fit.\".

Use that data to create an FAQ or addendum to contract or discovery call checklist or whatever. It's your business. You're in charge. Yes, you need clients and income but you get to decide who your best client is, know why that works when it works, and require courteous and professional engagement within boundaries you set. \n\nGood luck!",

          "body": "You’re not imagining it. This is very common on LinkedIn right now. High likes and comments don’t mean buying intent. Most engagement is performative, people commenting to stay visible in their own network rather than because they’re interested in clicking, DMing, or purchasing. A lot of what looks authentic is driven by automation, engagement pods, or templated replies. Not always bots, but close enough that it feels real and still converts to nothing.\nShared posts are especially weak for results. LinkedIn aggressively suppresses outbound links, and reshares almost never drive referral traffic. Seeing zero visitors even with thousands of likes isn’t unusual. On top of that, commenters are rarely leads. Real buyers usually lurk, save the post, or Google you later. They don’t ask public questions or say they’re “interested” in the comments.\nWhat actually works on LinkedIn is slower and less exciting. Posting consistently from your own founder profile, speaking directly to problem-aware buyers, and treating LinkedIn as a conversation and positioning channel rather than a traffic source. At YellowInk, we only see results when businesses stop chasing vanity metrics and focus on message and positioning over 30–60 days.\n\n\nTL;DR: LinkedIn isn’t broken, but paid shoutouts mostly are. Your spend didn’t buy leads, but it did buy clarity.",

We had property listings and everything happening, but behind the scenes it was pretty chaotic. Leads were coming from everywhere but follow ups weren’t consistent and a lot of things lived in spreadsheets or just in my head lol... I’m not very tech-savvy, so it always felt harder than it probably needed to be.\n\nI got introduced to Michael Ripia through other real estate agencies we knew (not ads or cold emails) which is why I was open to the conversation bcos i dont usually trust cold outreach lol...One of the first things we worked on wasn’t marketing or ads at all which kind of shocked me because thats what i thought the problem was. Turns out it was getting the foundations right. \n\nWe set up our hubspot CRM properly and actually used it the way it’s meant to be used. That meant cleaning up our database, setting up proper pipelines for sellers and buyers, automating follow-ups, and making sure enquiries didn’t just disappear if someone got busy.\n\nWe also tightened up how listings were marketed and tracked, so we could see what was working. Once that was in place, lead flow became an absolute breeze.\n\nWe’re now on track to hit around $2.1M in revenue by Q1 for this year, which is something I wouldn’t have believed from previous years, especially given how messy the businesses systems were...\n\nOne thing I really valued was that we didn’t stay reliant on outside help. Before finishing up, he helped me build an in-house marketing team of three and trained them on the systems, so the it kept running without me needing to be across every detail. Not posting this to brag, just sharing what worked for us. If you’re running a small business, especially in real estate and feel like growth is there but structure isn’t, this might be relatable.",

He specifically wanted this textured raised ink effect which required puff printing and that added to the cost but he said no problem. I ordered all the blank hoodies, did the setup work, printed everything, shipped it all out in early December. He confirmed delivery and even sent me a photo saying they looked great.   \nThen last week I got notified by my payment processor that he filed a dispute claiming the quality wasn’t as described and he wants a full refund including the deposit.

They took your product without paying for it. This isn't the same thing as not paying an invoice for a service provided.\n\nIf it were me, if they don't respond to my email request trying to make it right, I'd hire a lawyer and send them a strongly worded, certified letter educating them on the fact they've committed theft, highlighting previous case law, and pointing out it is a felony due to the value of the product. If they ignore the letter/don't respond, press charges. This isn't them not paying an invoice that you take to small claims court. This is fraud, and theft of product. Not services.\n\nGive them the opportunity to make it right, and maybe even offer a 10% discount, since they seem to think the product is not to their standard. Alternatively, they can return all of the product for a refund per your original contract (Hopefully you stated deposits are non-refundable. Do not refund the deposit).\n\nThen turn around and burn the company by turning those hoodies into some sort of art piece and selling them for cheap. Double points if you're in the companies HQ town.

      "selftext": "I’ve been doing ecommerce for a few years now, mostly behind the scenes, like ops, product sourcing, a bit of marketing, so I always thought, if anyone can run their own small shop, it should be me. Last year I finally decided to stop helping other brands grow and try building something that was actually mine.\n\nI didn’t quit my job or anything dramatic. This started as a side thing. My routine was pretty fixed: finish work around 7, grab takeout, sit on the couch, laptop on my knees by 9. That was my business time. At first it felt kind of exciting, like I was stealing time back from my day.\n\nThe idea itself was simple. Products I already understood, suppliers I’d worked with before, nothing fancy. What surprised me was how emotionally exhausting the small decisions were. Naming the brand took me three nights. Pricing made me second guess my entire career. I’d tweak product descriptions at 1am, wake up the next morning and hate every word. After making all those product related decisions, I kind of stalled for a while. I kept questioning whether I could actually run an online store at all. But I’d already put in a fair amount of time and money, so backing out didn’t really feel like an option. I don’t know much about frontend stuff, and hiring someone would’ve been another expense, so I just figured things out on my own. I learned to use Genstore to build a pretty rough first version of the site and then started doing some basic promotion on social media.\n\nThe real punch came after launch. Friends would say “wow that’s cool” and then no orders. Or one order, followed by three days of silence. I’d refresh analytics more than I’d like to admit. Every small cost suddenly felt loud: packaging, transaction fees, refunds. \n\nWhat I didn’t expect is how lonely it feels. At work, if something flops, it’s a team problem. Here, every mistake feels very personal. If a product doesn’t sell, it’s not the market, it’s my judgment. Some nights I honestly miss just clocking out and not caring.\n\nI’m still running the shop. It’s not huge, it’s not freedom, and it definitely hasn’t replaced my income. But it changed how I see small businesses. From the outside it always looks clean and aesthetic. From the inside it’s a lot of quiet doubt, tiny wins, and arguing with yourself at midnight.\n\nSo how others here deal with that mental side. Not the logistics or tactics, but the constant second guessing. Does that ever go away, or do you just get better at living with it?",

Even 1 sale is more than you had previously. And revenue generating. With just that new reframe you can rethink how you perceive these issues being the owner. Think about the progress. One day you didn’t have a business. Now on a different day you have a business! That is progress to be celebrated. Now carry that to orders and all the new things you get to learn and do. These are all new levels of understanding that you’re GAINING. You’re learning that strangers will support you more than friends and family. Everyone goes through that. It’s all progress, learning and new understanding! So just shift your focus a bit and practice gratitude that you’re on the journey that is your startup. Document it. Relish in it! Take pride in it and you’ll learn to be grateful for all of it! The good is just as valuable as the bad so try not to get too attached to outcomes but the process unfolding itself",

To add insult to injury, every user has to be on the same plan. \n\nFor example, I would like to have my account on the upgraded Standard plan (which comes with 2TB of storage), so I can use it as a company shared drive. That's $14/month, while the Starter plan for everyone else would be $7. You can't do that. For me to have 2TB of storage, everyone has to have 2TB of storage t $14.\n\nI think my best solution is to have everyone in my business on the $7 starter plan, then pay an additional $99/year for a 2TB Google One subscription. Not ideal, but overall it's the best value. \n\nWhere is everyone else moving their company emails?",

          "body": "There were several reasons to pull your email from other services into Gmail using POP3 retrieval. For some of them there are workarounds, for others not.\n\n1. You want to read all your email from two or more servers in one email client, i.e., Gmail.\n\n2. You want to back up all your email received on other servers in an online archive without paying for the storage, preferably one with lots of capacity, good search tools, good security, and easily accessible from anywhere, i.e. Gmail. (Presumably you also keep a local copy if you are smart.)\n\n3. You want to take advantage of Gmail's spam filtering and flexible auto filters applied to incoming email.\n\nThe solution that satisfies all 3 and is pretty much equivalent to what is being lost is to simply turn the direction of communications around and have your other email servers forward all email to Gmail instead of having Gmail retrieve the email by POP3 polling. This satisfies all 3 of the functions and it's faster (forwarding happens in seconds, whereas Gmail polls at irregular intervals which can stretch to hours). Problems: your other email services may not have a \"forward all\" function, or they may add a header which makes it look like the forwarded mail is coming from you rather than the original sender. And then there's the spam issue: there's a danger that dumb spam-blockers may decide that you are the originator of any spam among the emails that you are forwarding to Gmail, and therefore your email address should be blacklisted as a spammer (and yes, this does happen - I've encountered it, had to give up forwarding).\n\nOther partial solutions:\n\nThe Gmail app (not the web interface) allows you to view email from your other services together with your Gmail in the common Gmail interface. You just add your other services to the app as additional email sources. But this is view-only. This satisfies function#1. It does not retrieve that email and add it to your Gmail account, so no good for functions #2 and #3.\n\nYou can use an IMAP-enabled email client like Thunderbird, both on the desktop and as an app. Thunderbird lets you add Gmail (via IMAP) and your other IMAP/POP servers in one interface. And it lets you copy email to and from IMAP clients like Gmail. So it satisfies functions #1 and #2, although you have to do the copying manually. Sadly Gmail does not apply incoming email rules or spam filtering to email copied in via IMAP., so function #3 is out.",

The key is making sure your contractor sets up a proper Wise account on their end - they can receive in USD and hold it there or convert to local currency when rates are favorable.\n\nFew things that help avoid AML flags on the receiving end:\n\n1. Consistent, documented payments on a regular schedule (invoices help)\n2. Amounts that match what you'd expect for contractor work, not round numbers that look like crypto cashouts\n3. Having them receive directly into Wise rather than converting through local banks\n\nPayoneer works too but I've found their fees slightly higher for smaller amounts. SWIFT is fine but slow and expensive ($25-40 per transfer depending on banks).\n\nFor Georgia specifically, TBC Bank and Bank of Georgia both have decent USD account options if your contractor wants a local bank account that's crypto-separate. The issue your dev had was likely the P2P exchange triggering the flag, not the payment source itself.\n\nEOR is overkill for a single contractor unless you're planning to hire more in Georgia or need the legal protection of having them as an employee.",

Seen everything from $50/vid freelancers (sketchy quality) to premium video editing agencies $500-1000+ per video. Not sure what’s reasonable.\n\nOther small biz owners when did you make the call to outsource? What was tipping point?

          "body": "The tipping point math is straightforward: what's your hourly rate on client work versus the hours spent editing? If you're billing $150-200/hour for consulting and spending 10 hours editing a video, you're effectively paying $1500-2000 in opportunity cost per video. Even a $500 editor is a massive arbitrage.\n\nThe quality tier that makes sense for B2B educational content is probably $150-300 per video. You don't need motion graphics or fancy effects, you need clean cuts, good pacing, and professional audio. The $50 freelancers on Fiverr are hit or miss and the revision cycles eat any savings. The premium agencies are overkill for 8-10 minute educational videos. Our clients doing similar content usually land in that middle tier with a dedicated freelancer they've built a relationship with.\n\nThe finding process that works: post on Upwork with a specific test project, review 5-6 editors, pay for one video from your top 2-3 candidates, compare results. Once you find someone good, lock them in with consistent work. A freelancer who knows your style and preferences gets faster and better over time.\n\nThe ROI question you're wrestling with is real but probably backwards. You're not making YouTube money yet because you're producing at unsustainable volume. 2-3 videos monthly is the minimum for growth, and if that pace burns you out, you'll quit before the channel gains traction. The outsourcing cost is what makes consistency possible.\n\nThe weekend time is the real cost.

But once you have repeatable formats (testimonials, product demos, reels), editing becomes assembly-line work and your founder/owner time is better spent selling, hiring, or delivering.  \n  \nA practical threshold I’ve used:  \n\\- If you’re posting consistently (2–4x/week) and editing takes &gt;5 hours/week, outsource.  \n\\- If one decent client sale covers a month of editing, outsource.  \n\\- If your DIY videos are “good enough” but you’re not posting because you dread editing, outsource yesterday.  \n  \nAlso: build the distribution funnel so you can measure ROI. I’ve used Manus (AI-powered no-code web builder) to set up landing pages tied to specific videos, with built-in analytics and lead capture (forms into a database). That way, when you outsource, you can say “these 3 formats drive consult bookings” instead of guessing. You can even add Stripe if your videos push to a paid workshop or deposit.  \n  \nOutsourcing isn’t just quality—it’s throughput + consistency. Hire an editor for a small package first (like 8 shorts/month) and only scale when you see leads or sales attributed to it.",

The national franchise argues that they can't afford to remain in business at the new rates and there contract doesn't give the owner termination without cause.  Owners are not even concerned that half their storefronts are empty and it's essentially an anchor tenant of the shopping center.  Oddly enough, looks to be about the same market rate as your area.\n\nFor what it's worth though.. a lot of the small businesses you see are not necessarily thriving, even if they exist.  For a lot of entrepreneurs they are simply jobs, hopefully good paying jobs, but essentially jobs.  With the business only surviving, by a lot of owners sweat equity.",

At the time I signed the lease, the place was derelict, I spent a ton to rebuild it. So the initial rent was low, and now it is no more than a third of market value. It's a prime spot, five minutes walk from a subway station downtown. If I had to move, and pay market rent, I am not sure the business would be viable anymore. Now my rent is about 3% of my sales. \n\nAll of that said, renting was a terrible mistake, I wish I had bought something smaller I could afford. The place is now worth way more for development than it is for rental income. It's only a matter of time before it becomes condos. But that's when I will retire.",

Whether you're a tradesperson, consultant, freelancer, or growing business, the right number can make you instantly recognisable and easier to reach.\n\n\nWhy it matters:\n- Brand recall: A clean, memorable number sticks in your customer’s mind long after the conversation ends.  \n- Professional image: It signals that you take your business seriously and pay attention to the details.  \n- Customer trust: People are more likely to call a number that feels simple, clear, and intentional.  \n- Marketing impact: Whether on vans, business cards, websites, or ads, a standout number boosts response rates.\n\n\nAt SimpleSimUK.com, we've built a small startup focused on helping UK professionals secure premium, easy‑to‑remember mobile numbers without the usual hassle or inflated prices. It’s a simple idea, but one that genuinely elevates how people perceive your brand.\n\n\nIf you’re building your business, levelling up your personal brand, or just want a number that works as hard as you do, take a look at what we are creating.\n\n\n🌍 https://www.SimpleSimUK.com\n\n📞 +44 7777 787171\n\n\nSmall details build strong brands and your number is one of them.\n\n\n#SimpleSimUK #PersonalBranding #ProfessionalBranding #UKBusiness #SmallBusinessUK #StartupLifeUK #EntrepreneurMindset #BrandIdentity #MemorableNumbers #VIPNumbers #TradesBusiness #ConsultantLife #FreelancerTips #MarketingEssentials #CustomerExperience #StandOutFromTheCrowd",

Do to this a side hustle wasn't really an option, so it was go all in or don't. \n\nIt's been an interesting time, and I'm glad I made the jump.  It's not been stress free, there have been multiple issues that made me stop and wonder if I made the right decision.  But you stick it out, adjust, and make it work. \n\nRemember there is alot that goes into running a successful business besides actually doing the work.  There is bookkeeping, advertising, taxes, networking, ect...  If you are like me and are doing this solo, you are on your own. It doesn't sound like a ton, but when you're flush with work it stacks quickly.  \n\nBe detail-oriented.  It will help with multiple aspects, especially when doing your books. \n\nDo NOT underestimate the cost of insurance. Not just for the business, but your health insurance as well.  Last year I paid over $25k for my family's health insurance, its fucking expensive. \n\nThere is ALOT that goes into it, but what you get out is worth it. I was in business for 9 months last year and made about $200k in revenue.  My profit margin is about 60%, so I did ok.  This year I'm working on optimizing, growing my customer base and offered services, and investing in productizing an automation solution.\n\nIt can be done, but you have to have your heart in it.

          "body": "I did this but was joined with an ex-colleague of mine who I really trusted and was open to quitting to hop into entrepreneurship. We're very knowledgeable in our craft (working in tech revenue operations) so we opted to go into consulting versus building to have a steady cash flow.\n\nEach year we've learned a ton of things and almost had a 'theme' to it.\n\nYear 1 was about figuring out how to be a business. Figuring out our pitch, our messaging, our artifacts (eg. SOW), and all of that was all new. We also had the benefit of having a wide network with some translating to be some of first few clients. This allowed us to hire (and fire) people as needed.\n\nYear 2 was about learning how to execute. Still riding off of our network, enough word of mouth about us allowed us to hire more people. This was an interesting time since we were still figuring out how to deliver but also need to figure out how our team members can lighten up our load. At this point we were starting to feel like it was a business.\n\nYear 3 was about scaling and the harsh truths about business. Year 3 was by far the toughest. We've scaled to have a great team, we've gotten some good projects out but the reality is that nothing stays good forever. Client churns really affected us. Bad contracts that we signed got us on the hook for hard deliverables with minimal returns. Poor fiscal planning also caused us to close up shop. You have to remember that being business owners also means that multiple families now depend on your business for their livelihood -- which was personally for me was a very heavy responsibility and the real threat of closing up shop was a tough pill to swallow. We've made it out well after a very rocky start and blessed to live and tell the tale.\n\nYear 4 is where we're at now and the theme will be GTM (GoToMarket) this year. Our network is starting to dry up and we have to pivot to direct to customers at this point. As business owners, I can say that we've gone through quite a bit of battle scars. We're wiser but we still have lots to learn. This year we've beefed up our cash reserves to make sure we're able to navigate through hard times while preserving our team that we truly love working with. I personally am figuring out how we can perform marketing and be a good boss. We've expanded our skill sets to blend AI and RevOps together to actually build stuff that is valuable and not just junkware.\n\nSo it's been a wild ride so far. There were more rough times and rosy periods but the people you meet along the way, the experiences that you get exposed to, the hard decisions that noone else could make -- all these things, I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\nBe ready for a ton of sacrifices. It's not just time and effort. It's also relationships, mental and fiscal sanity.\n\nWould I do it again knowing what I know? I'm not sure. Financially, you don't get to see the returns until the end (I would 100% make more money working for a software company given my skill sets) so it's hard to say. Professionally, being your own boss is both awesome and a curse. Mentally, I've definitely developed to be more stoic but pretty sure that I'm also starting to develop bi-polarism lol. You'll miss your family, your friends, yourself.. but when you're there you also come to understand how privileged to have something that's growing regardless of the outcome -- so maybe the journey is the reward.\n\nGood luck to you brother/sister!",

          "body": "I'm just beginning my third year as a solopreneur.  As others have said, it's a blessing and a curse.  You are your own boss, you eat what you kill (for better or worse), you don't spend as much time with your family as you would like, you don't get paid vacation, etc.  Health insurance is beyond brutal, like eye-popping brutal.  But you are building something for yourself, and you can take on whatever kind of business you like, and do it in the way that you think is best for the client.\n\nI used to lead finance at a few high-growth, VC-backed startup companies.  I got fed up with the BS of internal politics and the pressure to run things differently than I wanted to.  So I took some time off to clear my head, then gradually stepped into doing \"fractional\" CFO work.  I get to do the kind of work I love, all day, every day, and I don't have to sit through hours of internal meetings that add little value.  My clients are SO appreciative of what I do for them.  I rarely heard \"thank you\" when I was in-house at my prior companies.  I hear it all the time now.  I've been able to leverage my network to get clients, I've never had to advertise or even solicit business in any way, people actually come to me via word of mouth, and my clients refer me to their friends unsolicited because I do great work for them and genuinely help them solve problems.  The work is way more rewarding than my old job, despite me actually performing the same job as before, just in a different way.\n\nIt took me about a year to replace my prior salary.  I probably could have done that faster but I wanted to gradually step into it and enjoy the early days.  It's been hard work but quite fun.  I haven't even leaned fully into it.  I've been approaching it as more of a lifestyle business where I'm less concerned with maximizing the opportunity and primarily just don't want to have a boss (though in reality it's FAR from a lifestyle business -- long hours and some stress when clients turn over and you need to replace them -- there will be good months and less-good months).\n\nI price reasonably, which works well for the smaller to mid-sized business I serve, but I don't compete on price.  My field is crowded with lots of subpar providers that often don't know what they are doing (posers), and the good providers are often both really expensive and inflexible in how they work with clients (e.g., they are often focused on providing scalable solutions with something of a one-size-fits-all playbook).  I fill the void in the middle, with more of an reasonable price + customized service to give people what they really want.  I could charge more for what I do -- possibly double -- and I will probably raise prices at some point this year, but not to anywhere near that degree.  Up until now I've just been so giddy about helping people and enjoying the ride of doing this on my own, that I haven't minded leaving some money on the table.  I have an abundance mindset: there's enough to go around for everyone, and at the end of the day, you can have anything in this world that you want, as long as you are willing to put in the work required to get it.\n\n  \nWishing you luck on your journey.  You've got this!",

(This can be used as a substitute for a dynamic QR code.)\n\nDynamic QR codes (often offered as trials or with limited monthly scans… we are quite generous):\n\nThese allow you to quickly set up a dedicated landing page and also provide analytics.\n\n- Dynamic vCards\n\n- Bio links – list multiple links (homepage, social profiles, etc.)\n\n- Business profiles – similar to a vCard, but enhanced with business-focused options such as hours of operation, reviews, and appointment links.\n\n\nAfter all of this, you can also create an NFC master card that you carry and tab on people’s phone to redirect to any of the options above (we’d recommend to have a QR code as a backup). However note that most phones will have a share contact feature when they are placed near each other.",

You have a relative shit ton of capital (money), think 4x the amount you currently have, and are 100% cool with not only losing all of it but being in debt for the same amount if your business doesn't go well.\n\n2. you've shadowed under other business owners plus have helped manage a bakery for *years* so you ideally know how to do all the business/management side already, or at least are very good at one of them and familiar with the other\n\nYou're only 20. Take it easy, you have literally all of your 20's ahead of you and that's still super young to jump into owning a business. Get experience. The real answer is say yes to advancement opportunities and take initiative where you are currently. Always be learning, always be hungry to find the next angle. Be comfortable with the idea your first business will almost certainly fail so don't put all your eggs in one basket.\n\nAt the end of the day, you can still get to where you want while young (I consider under 25 to be super young in matters of business), and don't let your entrepreneurial spirit die. But don't jump all in to the end game when you've only just begun. Do you do farmers markets at your current bakery? If not, this is a great thing to try and spear head and manage, pitch it to your boss. Try to find experience. If you *must* do something on your own and the itch is too strong, nothing wrong with moonlighting as a private cake/bread baker, maybe even renting out your own little commercial kitchen space to do farmers markets with. If this does gangbusters (beyond just good side cash) then you know you have good legs to start a formal business over. This is a great way to start small in the baking world and most successful bakeries I know of started exactly like this. Just don't *buy out a bakery*. That's the nuclear option. It's basically only ever worth doing this if you're stupid rich &amp; bored or super, super know what you are doing because you've been in the business for 10 year years. Ideally both.",

          "body": "I'm going to be quite blunt: Do not buy any business right now. While your ambition is nice, you need to have a few things to be successful in the food industry:\n\n1. Product market fit: Do you know 100% that what you can make outside of the recipes you know know will sell. Typically the normal starting point is baking for friends, going to farmer's markets and maybe opening up a stall while popping up, working for someone else for 5 years plus to learn all of the skills that you'll need in a business outside of baking. Do you know how to fix mixers or ovens? Do you know where to buy your supplies? Are you more retail or wholesale?\n2. Knowledge and skills - You need more time to learn. Work for a few different places over the next years and use other people's money to buy yourself a business education. How do other bakery businesses make money? Is it seasonal? Do they wholesale and deliver? What do they do with unsold product?\n3. Considering your age and experience consider a partner\n4. You can try reading e-myth it talks about somehow who is good at baking but not good at running a baking business. Just because you can bake a mean sourdough doesn't mean you can scale up a sourdough bread business.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have any questions. I am in the food business for over 5 years and have taken 3 different concepts to to successful outcomes, but the biggest difference is that I had 10 years of corporate experience, savings, industry connections, and that I knew how to work on the business and not just in the business.\n\nEdit: also baking kind of sucks as a lifestyle. You have to wake up early, be next to hot ovens all the time, your margins look ok but that's because you are killing yourself to make the product. You can virtually not take any days off until you have a trained staff, but in order to have a train staff you have to actually make real money. I sell mostly frozen and shelf stable food now not because I am super proud of it but the logistics of making your own product and selling it same day unless you are that good/popular/lucky makes it quite hard to make meaningful money long-term. \n\nAlso with most things on the internet I do not mean to discourage you. I always tell people asking if they should start a food business that they should avoid it not to shut them down but to let them know the harsh realities, and if you despite reading this feel strong enough in your concept, product market fit, location to ignore the advice and carry on - you must just have a small chance to do well.",

There is nothing they can do for you that you can’t do yourself or through a good tax person who wants to help like me )  by simply contacting IRS and setting up a payment plan yourself.  If debt is huge and you really can’t pay ( need proof) do an offer in compromise OIC. Yes you can do this on your own.  IRS rarely wipes out debt unless you are absolutely broke.  For reference, I a lowly tax preparer , have gotten debt forgives with just a phone call for people who owe money, no longer work and have no way to pay. Wiped completely over the phone.  If they go back to work, however they will have to pay that debt. I have also done offers in compromise successfully and gotten the debt lower not completely gone but lowered because they really can’t pay due to income change, closed business etc. They’ll work with you.   Payment plans kinda based on what you can pay and amount you owe.  If over 50k get it under that if you can and get on plan. I have gotten someone with 50,000 + in debt to pay as little as 500 a month.\nI have clients who come to me, because they went elsewhere and got in trouble with IRS and owe money. You can’t wipe that away but you can make arrangements.  In this case, I always try and amend the return to what it should’ve been correctly and then work with that and  most of the time IRS will accept that . You are still gonna owe, but maybe not as much as you would’ve with all that fraud and penalties plus they want $$ back.   Last year, I noticed that some of those people that came to me had gotten a letter telling them to correct it  instead of going directly to collection.  That’s actually very generous of the IRS considering that you’re committing fraud. With new software implementation at IRS it is so much easier to catch the fraud hopefully and they are actually sending out those letters to help people stop from moving forward with it.",

Get as many reviews on their as possible. 3-4 a week maximum or it gets flagged as spam and suspended. If your competition has 20 reviews in the top 3 of the maps pack, you need 30-40. Add lots of pictures, fill it in 100%. \n\nThen since you’re a service based business, DONT have a publicly visible address on google especially if you don’t want people coming to your home. I don’t have mine on my profile since I don’t have a publicly facing office. It will think people go to that address for your services and only show your profile in searches near that location. You need to remove it and select the option that you’re a service based business and select your 20 town service area so you can show up in searches 30 min away. \n\n2) website - just because it’s never been easier to make your own website doesn’t mean you should. It’s hard. It’s not enough to just build a site and think it will rank number 1. Web design is HARD and our brains are wired to pick up on patterns and symmetry. If your design doesn’t follow strict spacing systems and design guides then your brain will pick up on it and it will feel “off”. It’s the uncanny valley of design. It looks like a website, but it doesn’t quite look professional and you don’t know why. Your customers will have the same feeling. That’s what it is. Your design is important, don’t just slap anything together. \n\nAnd your load times matter. If your site takes more than 3 seconds to load you lose 50% of your traffic because it takes too long to load. That high bounce rate, low click through rate, and low session times tell Google you’re not a good results for the searches that come to you and you don’t rank well. That’s how a slow loading site can impact your ranking and conversions. You won’t show up on search results and the people who do find you won’t even reach your site. The average site takes 3-6 seconds to load. Page builders are notorious for it. They have a ton a bloat that has to load to make it work. So when you get a website done, use this to test it \n\nhttps://pagespeed.web.dev\n\nMake sure it loads fast and has at least 75-80/100 mobile performance score. \n\nThen there’s the content. SEO is such a broad term. It’s not “optimizing meta tags and submitting to the search console and ranking for 3 keywords” bullshit. It’s not a plugin either. It’s a process. You can’t rank a home page for multiple services and multiple locations. It’s impossible. So instead what you do is create location specific service pages to rank high for those service in those locations. Like this page on my site \n\nhttps://oakharborwebdesigns.com/hammond/small-business-web-designer/\n\nThis page shows up number 1 for “web designer Hammond in”. We did that for dozens of locations and multiple services to blanket the area in content and dominate the search results in a geographical region. THATS SEO. If you have an SEO person you hired and they aren’t doing this then they are not doing SEO. And blogging is its own thing. You use a service like “answer the public” to search for the most searched questions related to a service or product you offer and write blog posts answering those questions. Good blogs answer questions. You capture that traffic from the blog and convert it into leads. Even if that traffic isn’t in your state, it’s traffic. And Google notices you getting more and more traffic to this blog pages for certain related topics to your niche and that tells google you’re an expert on the subject matter and your domain now gets more authority for those keywords. More traffic + higher click through rates + longer session times = more authority and better ranking. That’s how all this works. Do that + backlinking and you have an SEO campaign. But it’s hard to do right. That’s why you hire a competent SEO expert to do this for you and monitor it. It’s not an exact science. We can do everything right and still not get to the front page. So what my SEO guy does is monitor your pages and when he sees ones that are going down in ranking or not going up, he will investigate it and rewrite the page until Google starts liking it and ranking it. Anyone who says they can guarantee results is a liar so watch out. Good SEO people don’t say that. Because it’s impossible to guarantee. All we can do is what we’re supposed to do and the rest is up to Google. And our job is to battle with them for supremacy. Sometimes it’s a longer battle than expected. But over time it will show results when done properly. \n\n3) ads. Google ads is great for service based businesses. Don’t run ads to your home page. Won’t work. People clicked that ad for a specific service, they wanna see it. If you send them to a home page and have to go looking for that thing they clicked the link for they will bounce. You send them to a dedicated landing page for that ad and service. Converts much higher. And if you have a website with a high page speed score then you’ll get lower cost per click rates because Google favors websites with better user experience and load times. And a faster loading website converts more traffic instead of wasting money on clicks who bailed before the site could load. If you’re starting to notice a pattern, a well built website is the center of a lot of it. It’s an investment. It’s the foundation of all your marketing efforts. \n\n…continued",

For a lot of small businesses that ends up being pretty unglamorous stuff like showing up well in search, clear offers, and doing the same few things consistently instead of chasing new channels.\nWhat usually doesn’t work is spreading effort thin because it feels like you’re supposed to be everywhere. Posting daily with no clear goal, testing ads without enough budget or patience, or copying what bigger brands do without their margins or runway. That’s where people get busy but don’t move.\nThe pattern I keep seeing is that progress comes from narrowing, not adding. Fewer channels, fewer messages, fewer experiments running at once.
