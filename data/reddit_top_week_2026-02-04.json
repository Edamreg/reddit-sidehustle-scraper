I have drafted a business plan and have a timeline.\n\nI am a loan signing agent so the plan is to physically go to title agencies, real estate brokers and real estate attorneys to get my name out there. Other options for revenue is regular notaries and data annotation work. \n\nWe also are discussing maybe doing some str cleanings on the weekends. Or maybe I do medical courier stuff.\n\nMy main focus is loan signing and if that takes off. Awesome. Then the other ones if needed. \n\nI am lucky to have a savings and a husband who is the main bread winner and very supportive.",

With school and work being not too rough I’d say I have a lot of free time, and I am making a pretty meager salary for the area I live in. \n\nAre there any STEM grad students that have some good side hustle ideas? maybe tutoring or something? My coding is pretty limited to python/matlab so not sure how i’d fair with web design, but if there’s something else software related I could do with those languages I’m all ears.\n\nAlso just curious to see other people’s weird ideas if they’re in grad school, I’m a musician and have been busking a bit but it rarely covers more than the price of lunch (although it’s hella fun)",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share the progress of my side hustle: building an independent comic book brand. I just officially released the first issue and a full merchandise shop.   \n  \nIt’s been a massive learning curve, and I figured I’d share the \"business\" side for anyone else looking to monetise their art or creative writing:\n\n* **The Setup:** I built a custom storefront to handle both physical and digital sales. Finding a platform that balances digital downloads with physical shipping was the biggest hurdle.\n* **The Inventory Strategy:** I decided to focus on physical copies rather than just digital. In the comic world, \"collectability\" is a huge driver for sales, and it justifies a higher price point than a $2 PDF.\n* **The Merch Strategy:** Instead of just putting a logo on a shirt, I’m using character art for the apparel. The goal is to make the merch \"wearable\" even for people who haven't read the book yet, effectively widening my customer base.\n* **The Design Choice:** Given the heavy use of AI in art these days, I made the conscious choice to hire a dedicated artist. It’s a higher upfront cost (which I’m currently recouping), but the quality and \"soul\" of the work are what will build a long-term brand.\n\nMy goal is to make this a self-sustaining hustle that funds Issue #2. If you’re an artist or writer, I’m happy to answer questions about the **site setup, finding an artist, or the fulfillment process** for physical goods!\n\n",

      "selftext": "I keep getting asked \"is it too late to get into AI photography?\"\n\nSo I wanted to share what I've actually learned doing this for 4 months.\n\nShort answer: no, it's not too late.\n\nIt's almost too early.\n\nWe're just scratching the surface.\n\nI am originally French speaking so excuse my English.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nTHE DEMAND IS REAL AND WIDE\n\n![img](fzdn09gms3hg1)\n\nOver four months I've worked with businesses across several industries.\n\nJewelry and fashion.\n\nA toy company.\n\nAn eyewear company.\n\nEven a charity in Africa.\n\nThe demand touches way more industries than I expected.\n\nObviously it touches more the industries that are aware of it — fashion, apparel.\n\nBut even industries that are less aware are starting to wake up.\n\nThere's an awareness problem because not everybody realizes AI photography for e-commerce is a thing.\n\nBut it's getting there.\n\nTHERE ARE ABOUT 20 UPWORK GIGS EVERY DAY\n\nI started finding clients on Upwork.\n\nSimply applying to gigs about AI photography.\n\nThere are about 20 such gigs posted every day.\n\nEvery. Day.\n\nThese are hot leads. People who really need the service.\n\nThen I added cold email outreach to specific industries.\n\nGot positive replies that way too.\n\nThe demand is there and there are multiple ways to reach it.\n\nMOST POTENTIAL CLIENTS DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS EXISTS\n\n![img](qmr880eds3hg1)\n\nHere's something I realized.\n\nThere are three types of potential clients right now.\n\nHyper-aware: they know the tools exist but can't do it themselves. They lack the workflow, the branding knowledge.\n\nSomewhat aware: they've seen realistic AI images somewhere but don't know how to make them. Maybe tried and got slop.\n\nNot aware at all: they have no idea AI photography for e-commerce is a thing.\n\nMost businesses are in the last two categories.\n\nI'd estimate 50% or more are not really aware of what's possible.\n\nThink about it.\n\nNano Banana is only like 6-7 months old.\n\nIt's just a very new technology.\n\nThe market is still waking up.\n\nCLIENTS NEED WAY MORE THAN \"A FEW IMAGES\"\n\nMost businesses don't just need 3 or 4 images.\n\nThey come saying \"can you do 4 images as a test.\"\n\nAfter that, they reveal they actually need way more.\n\nThat's why I structure my services around recurring offers.\n\nX images per month for X amount.\n\nMost e-commerce businesses have ongoing content needs.\n\nRecurring income beats constantly hunting for new clients.\n\nIT'S NOT JUST ABOUT PROMPTING\n\nWhat I realized is there are two sides to this work.\n\nOne side is creating the images. The AI stuff. The prompting.\n\nThe other side is delivery.\n\nDelivering work to clients.\n\nCollecting feedback.\n\nDoing revisions.\n\nFinal handoff.\n\nThat delivery workflow is easily 50% of the job.\n\nYou need to be structured about it.\n\nPLANNING BEFORE GENERATING IS EVERYTHING\n\nMy biggest mistake early on:\n\nClient sends brief.\n\nI immediately start generating images.\n\nThis is incredibly inefficient. You get bad output.\n\nWhat I do now is spend 1-2 hours planning before I touch any software.\n\nResearch. Moodboarding. Preparing my approach.\n\nThe style. The subject. The scene. The brand.\n\nThis made everything way more efficient.\n\nAI photography is not just prompting. There's a big R&amp;D part.\n\nTHE BOTTOM TIER WILL GET AUTOMATED — POSITION PREMIUM\n\n![img](9oqoggwos3hg1)\n\nI think about what happens when the AI gets even better.\n\nNano Banana 5 in a few years. So good anyone can get decent results.\n\nHere's what I think happens.\n\nSame thing that happened to web design.\n\nThe market for websites under $5K is getting wiped by AI builders.\n\nBut premium work — $10K, $15K projects — still exists.\n\nSame will happen here.\n\nThe bottom tier of AI photography will get wiped with every model update.\n\nThat's why you position premium from the start.\n\nDo work that justifies the value.\n\nDon't compete on price with people who'll get automated out.\n\nMOST ADVICE OUT THERE IS WRONG\n\nI found this the hard way.\n\nMost tutorials and workflows online are wrong or surface-level.\n\nThe tools are so new that even Google doesn't fully know what Nano Banana can do.\n\nI ran thousands of tests to figure out my own systems.\n\nThe few people doing this well aren't sharing their methods.\n\nOnly way to learn: do the work.\n\nIT'S NOT FOR EVERYONE — BUT IF YOU'RE CREATIVE, YOU HAVE AN EDGE\n\nCan anyone start an AI photography side hustle?\n\nHonestly, no.\n\nYou need a creative eye. That's hard to teach.\n\nIf you don't have it, you'll price yourself low and get wiped at the next update.\n\nYou also need some understanding of branding and visual marketing.\n\nGraphic designers have been building these skills for years.\n\nThat's why they're in a good position for this.\n\nIf you're a creative — graphic design, photography, visual marketing — this compounds your existing skills.\n\nIf you're starting from zero with no creative background, it's going to be harder.\n\nNot impossible. But steeper climb.\n\nSO IS IT TOO LATE?\n\nNo.\n\nIt's really not too late.\n\nIt's almost too early.\n\nThere is way more demand than there are people qualified to meet it.\n\nThe field is wide open.\n\nAll you need is:\n\nBuild a little niche portfolio.\n\nStart reaching out to people in your niche.\n\nMaybe offer a free sample to get your foot in the door.\n\nStart working on real client projects.\n\nThat's how I started.\n\nTHAT'S ABOUT IT\n\nThis is not a get rich quick method.\n\nBut it's a real opportunity if you have creative skills.\n\nThe demand is there.\n\nThe competition is still low.\n\nI'm sharing this because I feel like a lot of people could use this.\n\nEspecially if you're into graphic design, photography, if you're a creative person.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any questions.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m Nicolas.\n\nI wanted to share how I went from being a baker making minimum wage to generating over $1.5 million in revenue. This is going to be long because I want to share everything: the strategy, the mistakes, and what actually worked.\n\nSo let’s go back in 2008, I’m 16, I dropped out of school in France to become a baker. The kind of job where you wake up at 4am, come home completely wrecked, and barely make enough to survive.\n\nBut I was obsessed with the internet. Every day after work, I’d teach myself to code. No courses, no bootcamp, just YouTube tutorials and reading other people’s code until things started making sense. Took me years. Oh yeah, in 2008, AI was only in movies, so code was made by real people 😅\n\nEventually I started making websites for local businesses. $100 here, $200 there, nothing crazy at all.\n\nBut here’s what pissed me off though: every time I took a new client, I had to learn a completely new WordPress theme. Different settings, different options, different everything. I remember spending an entire weekend just figuring out how to change a header color on some theme because the documentation was really bad.\n\nI thought: why isn’t there ONE theme that does everything?\n\nSo in 2016, I built it myself. Called it OceanWP.\n\nOther devs on forums told me to sell it for $59 like other premium themes. I released it for free on WordPress repository instead. People thought I was insane.\n\nThe first months, I started to believe that maybe they were right. A few hundred downloads, mass silence. I kept refreshing the stats page like an idiot thinking something was broken.\n\nBut then it started spreading through forum recommendations and blog reviews. People telling other people.\n\nBy year three, it was on 500,000+ websites. Still at 500K+ active installs today actually.\n\nThe model was simple: the free version was genuinely good. Not crippled, not annoying upsells everywhere. Just a solid theme. But if you wanted premium extensions like more templates, more features, priority support, you paid.\n\nBy year 2 I was making $15-20K/month. Just me, no team, no investors, no ads. Over 3 years the theme generated more than $1.5 million total.\n\nWhat made it work? I think it was just solving my own problem. Turns out thousands of other developers had the same frustration and I didn’t know it. The free model helped too. Free users became paying customers, and more importantly they told their friends. I also answered every single support ticket personally for the first 2 years. Probably wasn’t healthy but people noticed.\n\nI’ll share what went wrong in another post.\n\nSpoiler: I lost most of that money through stupid decisions. Turns out making money is very different from keeping it. Learned that the hard way, but that’s a story for another day.\n\nRight now I’m building an AI LinkedIn content tool. Same idea, solves a big problem for many people. We’ll see if it goes anywhere.\n\nAnyway, happy to answer questions about pricing strategy, the freemium model, whatever.\n\nCurious if anyone else stumbled into something similar, building a thing just because the existing options annoyed you.",

      "selftext": "**STEP 1:** Open TikTok Shop Affiliate\n\nCreate a new TikTok account or use an existing one.  \nGo to your profile, open TikTok Shop, and enable the Affiliate option.  \nYou do not need a large following, in many cases 0 to 500 followers is enough.\n\nIf TikTok Shop is not available in your country yet, you can use markets where it is active, such as the UK or US, through a company or a partner.\n\n**STEP 2:** Choose the PRODUCT ' this is critical'\n\nDo not choose a product just because it looks cool. Choose something that is viral and solves a real problem.\n\nGood examples include beauty gadgets like cleaners, trimmers, or massagers, small home tools, organization products for cars, kitchens, or desks, fitness accessories, and pet products.\n\nThe ideal price range is between $10 and $40, commission should be between 20 and 60 percent, and the product should already have sales and existing video content.\n\nInside TikTok Shop, look for products labeled Trending, Most Sold, and High Commission.\n\n**STEP 3:** You do NOT record yourself (this is the best)\n\nWithout an audience, you use a UGC strategy, also known as user-generated content.\n\nThere are three options.  \nThe fastest option is to reuse approved promotional videos directly from TikTok Shop through the Creators section. Many products already allow this. You simply repost the video and add your affiliate link.\n\nThe second option is AI video creation. You can use tools like CapCut, Pika, or Runway and combine product images, on-screen text, and AI voiceovers.\n\nYou can use leonardo ai + kling or similar to animate your videos most videos like those are created in that way.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gp1b2fgfn4hg1.png?width=1279&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=011a2889e67ea90e9a3c525f67f1431336a7bfd5\n\n  \nBut you can also use sora ai or google nano bannana.\n\nThis is for more realism click-bait videos.\n\nAlso you can combine several of these tools for perfect product promotion within the video.\n\n\n\nThe third and best long-term option is to pay UGC creators. You can message smaller creators with something like:  \n“Hey, would you record a short video for this product? I pay $10–$20.”\n\nOne good video can keep generating sales for months.\n\n\n\n**STEP 4:** What a converting video looks like\n\nTikTok favors simple structures.  \nVideos should be between 15 and 25 seconds.\n\nThe first two seconds are the hook, for example:  \n“I didn’t know I needed THIS until I tried it…”\n\nThen show the problem:  \n“I always struggled with…”\n\nNext comes the solution, the product itself:  \n“This small gadget fixes it in 10 seconds.”\n\nFinish with a call to action:  \n“The link is below, it’s currently on sale.”\n\nOn-screen text is mandatory, and you do not need to speak yourself.\n\n\n\n**STEP 5:** Posting and volume\n\nPost 1 to 2 videos per day.  \nTest one product with 5 to 10 different videos.  \nDo not delete videos that do not perform immediately, some go viral after 7 days.\n\nOne video that takes off can make all the effort worth it.\n\nREALISTIC EARNINGS EXAMPLE\n\nIf the product price is $25 and the commission is 40 percent, that is $10 per sale.  \nOne viral video with 50 sales per day equals about $500 per day. This is not consistent, but it is possible.\n\nBeginners often make 1 to 3 sales per day, around $10 to $30. After a few weeks, this can grow into $300 to $1,000 per month.\n\n**MOST COMMON MISTAKES**\n\nChoosing a pretty product instead of a selling one  \nPosting only one video  \nMaking videos that are too long  \nNo on-screen text  \nGiving up after three days.\n\n**Best Time to Post TikTok Videos (Europe &amp; USA)**\n\nIf you target a European audience\n\nBest performing times are:\n\nWeekdays  \n07:00 – 09:00 AM  \n12:00 – 02:00 PM  \n06:00 – 10:00 PM (best window)\n\nWeekends  \n09:00 – 11:00 AM  \n06:00 – 11:00 PM\n\nIf you target a USA audience\n\nFrom European time zones, post between:\n\n06:00 PM – 01:00 AM  \nThis matches US morning and afternoon hours.\n\n\n\nImportant Truth (Most People Ignore This)\n\nTikTok does not rank videos only based on posting time.  \nWhat matters more is:\n\nThe first 30–60 minutes\n\nWatch time and retention\n\nComments, saves, and shares\n\nIf a video performs well early, TikTok will push it regardless of the posting.\n\n# Using this method, even a new account without followers will get a few hundred to a few thousand views, which will end up with 1-3 sales per day, but if you continue at this pace, some videos will go viral and get a lot of views, which is hundreds of sales.\n\n**To be Honest**\n\nThis is not 100 percent passive, but you do not need an audience, your own product, a website, or ads.\n\nYou only need consistency and testing\n\nHere is my previously posts.\n\n[make 100k monthly with only 28$ investing with camping solar charger, Spotify ai phonk music , yt + digital selling also avoid my mistakes!](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalproductselling/comments/1nx3v0m/i_make_100k_monthly_with_only_28_investing_with/)\n\nAnd see you soon with more fresh tutorials.\n\nif you have question feel free to ask in comments.\n\n",

      "selftext": "8 years on Reddit. Many evenings spent reading here. Not a single comment or post, until now.\n\nThis is the short version of the story of how I managed to get completely carried away and basically managed to get manipulated by ChatGPT in the hunt for a side business. TWICE. Spoiler: not super dramatic.\n\n \n\nShort background. I’m 34 years old, male. Living a good life. I live in a townhouse in one of the nicest suburbs of a large city in a Scandinavian country. I have two healthy children. I work full-time as a property manager at a relatively large real estate company. I’ve been at the same company for ten years. I enjoy my job a lot since I’m good at it. I can work about 30 hours a week and handle the job without problems. I can come and go as I please. I pick up my kids from preschool at 16:00 two to three times a week. I’m social, have many friends. Two cars, huge mortgage, etc.\n\n \n\nThe problem may have been that things have become a bit too stable and therefore boring. My job doesn’t come with any bonuses, there are no unexpected joys in professional life. Sure, I sometimes make good deals that together have built a solid career. But there’s never any big unexpected boost and it no longer really contributes to self-realization.\n\n \n\nThat made me, about eight months ago, become obsessed with the idea of a side income. Preferably a passive one. Mostly to prove to myself that I can, but also to have that small extra income stream. I’m not a computer guy, but like everyone else I’ve used AI to clean up texts, structure things, and handle minor legal stuff at work. But in my new pursuit of income, I let my collaboration with CGPT go way too far, and it eventually led me to some incredibly depressing insights.\n\n \n\nThe first project came more from myself. The idea was to write digital guides in PDF format in the children and family segment. In the first and only product, I summarized different methods of sleep training for babies, compressed into a concrete, concise guide, and had a trained pediatrician validate the content and sign it as a quality guarantee. Not a bad idea, really. And during the project I learned how to start a company, build a simple Shopify site, the basics of Google Ads and Meta Ads, the basics of Canva, etc. Long story short: I burned too much money on ads before I was anywhere near breaking even. The insights afterward were reasonable and, in hindsight, likely, as I among other things completely underestimated the need for marketing and the work it entails. Passive income is not passive when you have to keep producing products and maintaining marketing. By the time I launched my little site, I had spent every evening for three months and had basically completely sidelined my regular job. I was almost burned out.\n\nIn short, I was naive enough to believe I would reach break-even with a product priced at $30 and then let it tick along and later calmly scale without further marketing work. The money ran out after 7 sales (satisfied customers), but I was far from break-even on ad costs. But as said, I learned a lot. Among other things, I realized that I have zero interest in building a brand, being visible, building awareness and community. I want to be completely anonymous. That makes it hard to market products, haha. Also incredibly naive to think that in my very limited free time I would learn what people spend their entire professional lives mastering.\n\n \n\nOne problem I discovered too late was that at some point along the way, I started trusting CGPT too much. From pure IT support it became more about discussing business plans and next reasonable step. I became increasingly frustrated because every time we simulated different efforts and scenarios, it turned out that everything was always more demanding, with more steps, and with worse outcomes. Example, CGPT suggests setting up a Meta campaign in a certain way, says it takes a maximum of 40 minutes and you’ll easily get 40 conversions. Result: irritation, two evenings of work, and zero outcome. Every new suggestion and simulation triggered me immensely and I put in more money and time than I should have in hopes of more sales. The result was that I became stressed, easily irritated, almost burned out.\n\n \n\nI paused the project. Felt much better for two months. Until two weeks ago when I fell back in again. A boring day at work and I started getting excited about the idea of finding passive income with a computer again. In short, I let CGPT run the whole thing from start to finish this time. Suddenly I was on completely unfamiliar ground (I know many of you here are incredibly skilled with digital products and social media—I am not). CGPT guided me to buy three Excel templates on Etsy with extended resale licenses, package them as a system— in my case about product pricing—and sell it on Gumroad as a system. I spent a week on this. Here too, CGPT’s projections were continuously lowered over time; time, cost, and difficulty for each step kept being pushed further ahead. The stress from burned money and workload came immediately this time. Difficulty eating and sleeping. Constantly working towards the launch, hoping that now I can launch, then I’ll let it rest for a while and let the revenue start coming in. In this project I had done zero research. I didn’t even know what Gumroad was. So when the launch was done and I began to realize that it requires extensive external traffic for anyone to even consider buying your product, the flop was a fact. Incredibly stupid in hindsight. But I think I believed it would sit on Gumroad, people would go there, search for my product, and it would sell now and then. But there it sits now. 0 views and 0 sales. $400 in total costs for Excel licenses…\n\nThe money was gone. The energy was gone. And I was so incredibly tired of walking around hoping for things and working in my free time only to be disappointed. I have been so incredibly distracted and not present during these periods.\n\nFor some reason I had never been in this forum before, and to comfort myself I went in and read yesterday. My feeling after reading 40+ posts was sadness and the feeling of being a total fucking idiot. Half of what is written here is exactly the same shit that CGPT suggested I should do as free marketing. I even went as far as to create a new Reddit account, copy-paste some fake helpful comments with the expectation that someone would ask follow-up questions and magically ask for my product. I’m really ashamed… But I did realize fairly quickly that it was idiotic.\n\n \n\nIt’s so incredibly depressing and brain-dead, and when you see the pattern of how many people fall into the same generic trap, you just get this dark and bleak feeling about the world.\n\n \n\nI fully understand that those of you who have followed the developments here more closely over the past few years probably think I’m completely lobotomized. And honestly: I’m not a stupid person and I have fairly good self-awareness. That’s why the realization of how I ended up in these failures came as an unpleasant surprise. In total, it amounts to $2,000, and now I’m going to try to forget all. The feeling of failure and loosing myself is way worse than the money. I’m not sure what I even want to get out of this post. I think I’m looking for some kind of closure and using this as therapy for myself. My hunt for a side income remains. There will be a small pause, though. The drive is there, but I need to find my way back to myself. And from now on, all ideas and plans will come from my own gut feeling or relationships in the real world. As a quiet protest, I didn’t even let CGPT translate this text, so you’ll have to make do with my middle-school English.\n\n \n\nIf you have any ideas that don’t consist of digital products or selling your soul online, I’m happy to listen!\n\n ",

Honestly it is hard to get passive income as most of the time you have to set things up before and finding clients is difficult. I suggest you invest your money instead, I read that before investing it you should have at least 6 months of savings then when your money is safely in your savings bank account.\n\nThen with your monthly income you can invest it into ETF or S&amp;P 500 funds for example. Invest 100 or 200 monthly in an EFT over 5 years. These are short term investments that yield more money than traditional ones. Or you can invest over 15 years in those that are sort of retirement funds to find them they should be notified with the year of your retirement for example fidelity fund 2046 and here you save every month the same amount over the 15 years or more.\n\n\nAnd if you really want to make money you could sell old items, or cakes you make locally and add a few bucks in your pocket, there is even a guy who started making  income by renting his camping items to those who didn't want to buy some but it is still a bit of work.

Etsy digital products work if you focus on one product type like planners, checklists, or templates and improve listings slowly each week. Affiliate marketing works if you pick one niche and keep posting consistently, otherwise you will see nothing for a long time. A faceless YouTube channel can work too, but it is not quick. There are many options, but consistency is the part most people fail at, so pick one lane, set a small weekly routine, and stick to it.",

Yet, the bigger the pain the bigger the payout. \n\n- Then check whether it’s a problem that many more ppl have.\n\n- design a SYSTEM to address that problem\n\n- test in a small scale\n\n- scale and maintain it\n\n- exit\n\nIn terms of skills, definitely learn anything you are interested in from business, finance, coding etc…but since it’ll take time and effort, make sure you like it!\n\nSorry, it’s not a solution that takes a week or a month to address, but that’s probably close to reality for what “passive income” really is.",

I was working full time and didn’t have a lot of spare hours either, so burnout was a real concern.\n\nWhat ended up working for me was getting into the financial services space by starting with an agency, rather than trying to invent something from scratch. It wasn’t passive at the beginning, but it was flexible. I could learn evenings/weekends, work with real people, and gradually build systems so the income became more predictable over time.\n\nWhat I liked about this path:\n\t•\tTime flexibility (you decide when you work)\n\t•\tSkills you learn are useful long-term (financial literacy, client conversations)\n\t•\tYou can start small and scale only if/when it makes sense for your family\n\t•\tOver time, parts of it become semi-passive through referrals and team growth\n\nIt’s definitely not for everyone, but for families with limited time who want something realistic and sustainable, it’s been a solid option for me.\n\nCurious to hear what others here have tried that balanced family life without burning out.",

Real users, real results, real momentum, and honestly, I’m still learning as I go.\n\nIf you want to try it out, search MyFutureSelf on iOS -- and I won’t gatekeep the community… hit “X” on the paywall and you’ll get an 80% discount. 🙌",

For example, Mist⁤play is fr⁤ee to try and gives gift cards for playing mobile games, not life changing, but it turns commute or couch time into a little extra cash.\n\nHas anyone taken 2-3 hours a day and turned it into a steady secondary income?

Was skeptical at first, but after seeing the numbers people were posting, figured I'd give it a shot.\n\nIt took about 8 weeks, but just closed the first month over $1,000 (hit $1,400 total). It’s not the crazy numbers some of the big players are making yet, but it’s proof that this actually works. Since I learned a lot from this sub, wanted to share the setup.\n\nThe hardest part was getting the character to look consistent. Most web generators have strict filters so had to shop around. Finally generated about 25 consistent images of the same character before launching. If the face morphs between posts, people notice immediately.\n\nFor traffic, I made accounts for Insta, TikTok, and Reddit. Same pfp, generic bio. Posting 2-3 times a day on IG/TikTok (mostly simple reels using trending audio). Reddit has been the real driver though. Found a few niche subreddits that allow this content and the competition is way lower than IG.\n\nThe biggest learning curve was the platform choice. I originally started on Fanvue because everyone recommended it. It worked fine for getting subs, but realized the fees were eating into the margins way too much.\n\nI decided to test moving the traffic to Stacked recently just to see if the take home would be better. Surprisingly, the traffic converted about the same as Fanvue, but because Stacked has lower fees, I actually kept more of the money. Payouts have been fine so far, no holds or anything.\n\nAnyway, it’s a grind, but hitting that first 4 figure month changed the mindset. Just wanted to share that it is possible if you stick to a schedule.",

The “face morph” issue is the real tell, most people underestimate how fast Reddit spots inconsistencies.\n\nCurious, what did your Reddit posting actually look like? Were you posting the content directly in allowed subs, or more like building a profile and funneling from comments?\n\nIf Reddit is your main driver, the big unlock is catching threads the moment someone is asking for recs or “is X worth it” so you're early and you don't sound like you're copy pasting.   \nI built Threadpal for that exact problem because I kept missing high intent threads while juggling multiple subs. Even without a tool, basic rule is reply fast, be specific and stay native to each sub’s vibe.",

You use them for separate things?\n3. Most importantly, do you advertise somehow? Post on Fb groups of anywhere alse perhaps? Or is everything organic?\n4. How many videos do you post each day and how many did you post so far?\nCongrats for your nice progress!! Cheers mate",

      "selftext": "I recently came across a viral Instagram reel which taught me to be productive each day!\n\nIn the reel someone was explaining how short a year actually is. He showed the entire year as 365 dots, and every day one dot gets filled. Watching those dots fill up made it hit differently - a whole year suddenly felt very small and very real.\n\nThat reel stuck with me and it gave me an app idea.\n\nI decided to build an app around that concept. The app shows the year as a visual dot grid, where each dot represents one day. As days pass, the dots fill up, so you can clearly see how much of the year is already gone and how much is still left.\n\nAlso I added event reminders with the same concept.\n\nIf anyone interested here is the app - [Dale](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dale-days-left-year-tracker/id6757920298)",

      "selftext": "Before i get started, I’m a student who started looking for passive ways to earn cash around summer last year. I had been running a tiktok page writing and posting short stories with ai images on slideshows and selling guides on my workflow, that was making about $500/month at its peak (summer 2023) but i got burnt out as it was very very hands-on (writing full fledged short stories daily while dealing with essays and deadlines). I decided to do some research and figured faceless YouTube automation was my best bet at making money and keeping it as passive as possible.\n\nI got started on faceless youtube with the long-form reddit stories and within a couple of months i was monetized, had about 1.5k subs, and was making maybe £75–£250 per week. It was good pocket money, and quite passive but the growth totally stagnated. I basically started on reddit stories right at the end of the wave, when it got super oversaturated with no way to stand out.\n\nI started looking for a niche that was high-complexity (so fewer people could copy it) but high-demand. I was scrolling through Zack D Films shorts and had an oh shit momentt and I started wondering if I could recreate his blender 3d style with ai.\n\nI spent a week tinkering, and I actually managed to clank together a workflow that looks surprisingly close. Here’s a quick breakdown of how I did it manually (before I found a way to automate and make it more passive):  \n\n\n**Step 1: Scripting**\n\nI’d go to ChatGPT and use a prompt like:\n\n\\&gt; \"Return me a clean Zack-D-Films style script for short-form content. Keep it under 500 characters. Each line should be a story beat. Cinematic and engaging.\" (truncated prompt)\n\n**Step 2: Visual Prompts**\n\nI’d then ask it to expand those beats into image and video prompts:\n\n\\&gt; \"Expand each story beat into an image prompt and a video prompt. Split into STYLE/CAMERA/SETTING/ACTION. Emphasize dynamic camera motion for video prompts. Non-graphic, no gore.\"\n\n**Step 3: Image and Video generation**\n\nI used replicate (developer api website, it’s pay-per-use, so i wasnt dealing with monthly subscriptions or queues) to make all my images and vids. You can use google studio for images and grok to animate instead if you prefer\n\nI used the nano-banana image model (much cheaper than the pro version) to generate a base image for each story beat.\n\nI’d then take that image and feed it into the seedance-1-lite using the video prompt ChatGPT gave me for that storyboard scene.\n\n**Step 4: Editing**\n\nI’d take those 6–8 clips, throw them into CapCut in order and add a narration from ElevenLabs and sometimes the official Zack D Films background music. If I had some extra time on my hands I'd add some synced subtitles (adding subtitles was the worst part holy shit). All in all it would take me about 2 hours per video and cost about \\~$0.80 per final video\n\n**Results:**\n\nI started a fresh channel (to not introduce context drift to the reddit one) and i aged it for a week. The results were ridiculous, it had taken me about \\~3 months to get my reddit stories channel monetised but the zack d films shorts account hit 4,000 watch hours and was monetised in just over 3 weeks. That was my fastest period of growth and if I had been monetised i did the maths and it wouldve been around \\~$4000-5000 in rpm based on views.\n\n**Step 5: My pivot to automation (passiveness) \\[optional\\]**\n\nThe money was great, but 2 hours of editing per short was not \"passive\" in my eyes. I was starting to burn out like with the tiktok ai stories channel.\n\nWhat prevented me from burning out and actually accelerated my growth was when the tool I was using for Reddit stories on my other channel added a Zack D Films format as per my request (i shared my workflow with the dev who then automated it). It basically automated the entire workflow I described above. I went from spending 2 hours per video to 5 minutes.\n\nNow, I post daily, and the channel is pulling in £1.1k–£1.8k per week. Because almost nobody knows how to make (or more aptly is *actually posting)* this specific style yet, the views are way more stable than the Reddit niche.\n\nThe reason im comfortable sharing all this is because information is never the wedge or gap in this day and age. There's an abundance of resources and information on basically anything, but almost no one will actually go ahead and execute. And if they do they wont stick around long enough for it to matter. Thats why i feel comfortable sharing my workflow like this without worrying it'll saturate my niche, and besides if it does, theres at least 2-3 new niches in the faceless channel space each month, and I always try to start one new channel per month (looking at getting into ai horror story guides). Truly I just want to give back however i can for people looking at legit ways to earn passively.\n\nSome caveats i learned from my time:\n\nLocation Matters: Being in the UK \"nerfs\" my RPM a bit. If you’re in the US, your earnings for the same views would probably be 20-30% higher.  \n  \nDont overthink the ai: there are some AI artifacts, but 80% of viewers on Shorts/tiktok really dont care as i noticed in my comments. Video just has to be engaging with a good hook (retention matters so much)\n\nConsistency: Posting daily is what took me from £300 to £1,000+, automate as soon as you can.\n\nIf you need the full prompts I use or want to see examples of the final videos just leave a comment. If you'd like me to do a write-up on my tiktok page and how I used to funnel viewers to buy the guides i can post that too this week.  \n  \nGood luck with whatever venture you choose fellow passive earner!",

Most things either take way more ongoing effort than advertised or they require constant attention to stay profitable. Lately I’ve been more interested in setups that are closer to low maintenance systems rather than fully hands off. For me, that’s meant focusing on structure and consistency over chasing new ideas. I’ve experimented with a few different platforms and approaches and some have worked better than others. One example has been using a sweepstakes style platform like Bracco as part of a rules based setup. It’s obviously not passive in the dividend sense but once the system is defined, it doesn’t require much day to day effort compared to other side income experiments I’ve tried.\n\n\n\nI want to know how people here define passive income in practice. Do you only count things that are completely hands off or do you include systems that need light maintenance once they’re dialed in?",

To make a full-time living, you should have your own brand, and attract students not only with individual lessons, but group lessons, selling courses, test preparation, and so on. You should develop your own materials for sale and market them. Essentially, you'll need to build a business around yourself. Most people don't have the time and energy to do that, and will simply try their best using the platforms available. But as of right now, it's no way to make a living. There are other things you can do mostly related to developing your own business in different directions. But in any case, you'll need to develop new skills.

      "selftext": "Started this affiliate site back in June, productivity software niche, mostly high-ticket SaaS stuff. Been about 7-8 months now.\n\nFirst few months sucked. Maybe 50 visitors a month, barely any sales. Was targeting comparison keywords like \"Tool A vs Tool B\" because I figured people searching that are closer to buying than people searching \"best productivity tools\" or whatever.\n\nAround September October things started picking up. Traffic went from nothing to like 1,500 then 2,200 then by December I was getting close to 3k visitors. Revenue hit around $4,800 in December which felt insane compared to where I started.\n\nNow it's just stuck. Been at roughly 2,700-2,900 visitors for the past two months. Some days it's 2,500, some days 3,000, but it's not actually growing. Revenue's around $4,200 now, dropped a bit because one of my affiliate programs cut their commission rates in December.\n\nI'm still publishing, got 47 posts up now, but new stuff isn't ranking like before. My best post makes close to $900 a month by itself, ranks number 2 for some high intent keyword. But I can't figure out how to replicate that. Other posts I write just sit on page 3 or 4 going nowhere.\n\nConversion rate's decent, around 4%. I see people here with way more traffic but converting at 1% so I guess that's something. Most of my sales come from the comparison posts where I actually use both tools and show screenshots and stuff. Takes longer to write but people can tell when you've actually used something.\n\nStarted doing screen recordings in my posts too, just showing how the software works. Time on page went way up after that, from under a minute to like 3 minutes. Probably helped with rankings.\n\nGot an email list going, around 850 people now. Growing maybe 30-40 a week. When I send out new posts I get a spike in traffic and sales. Probably 20-25% of revenue comes from email but hard to track exactly.\n\nTried a bunch of stuff that didn't work. Did some guest posting, got a few backlinks, saw zero impact. Tried Pinterest for a month, total waste of time for my niche. Ran some Facebook ads and lost money, spent like $340 and made back maybe $190.\n\nI post on Reddit sometimes in relevant subs when I can actually help someone. That drives some traffic, maybe 150-200 a month, but you can't be promotional so it's slow.\n\nI'm using Ahrefs for keywords, costs $99/month which sucks. For images just whatever's fastest, usually Canva or APOB or Figma, doesn't really matter as long as it looks consistent.\n\nThe thing that's frustrating is I don't know what changed. Traffic was growing steadily, now it's not. I'm doing the same stuff. Writing similar posts, targeting similar keywords, same quality. But new posts aren't ranking.\n\nAlso seeing bigger sites starting to target my keywords. They have way more domain authority so I'm probably screwed on those. Been trying to go deeper on topics or find angles they haven't covered but who knows.\n\nLike did Google change something in December? Or did I accidentally do something that tanked my site? No idea.\n\nThe posts that are already ranking are still doing fine. They're not growing but they're not dropping either. It's just new content isn't taking off.\n\nSpending maybe 15-20 hours a week on this. Feels like a lot for results that aren't moving.\n\nStarting to think either I'm missing something obvious or this is just what happens and you have to grind through it. Not sure if I should keep doing the same thing or completely change strategy.\n\nAnyone else stuck like this? Or am I just doing something obviously wrong that everyone else figured out?",

Instead of grinding out new posts that aren't ranking, I'd go back to those top performers and add more internal links, update them with fresh screenshots, add comparison tables, and build supporting content that links into them.

Since there’s no revenue on our end, I’m trying to figure out the most efficient way to keep the top of funnel heavy.\n\n​As it stands: \n\nWe have solid screening/selection resources, so I’m fine with high volume, lower quality apps. We can filter through the noise pretty easily.\n\n​We’ve got a big LinkedIn page (have gotten about one hundred apps in the first few weeks) and have done some organic Reddit posts (have gotten about 50 apps in the first few weeks), but it’s not scalable, or sustainable.\n\n​I have $500/day to spend on scaling applications, and some team members to help with organic.\n\n​The Question:\n\nIf you had $500/day to get as many founders as possible to apply for a development grant, where would you put it?\n\n​I’m debating between Meta (for raw volume) or LinkedIn ads (expensive but targeted). Also curious if anyone has actually seen Reddit Ads work for this kind of thing, or if it's a money pit. Also considering sponsored placement in Discord groups, sponsored posts on IG, etc.\n\nWe're also considering finding some folks interested in helping us out, for \\~$20 per application they can bring in, but also understand for most people that wouldn't be worth the effort required.\n\n​Open to any \"best bets\" or specific platforms I should be looking at.

Core split: 60% LinkedIn, 20% Meta, 20% experiments.\n\nOn LinkedIn: run lead gen forms targeting job titles (founder, cofounder, CTO) + company size (1–10, 11–50) + interests around accelerators, YC, Techstars, AWS Activate, etc. Lead-gen forms usually get more volume than sending to a landing page, then you can nurture via email. Use a clear hook like “non-dilutive dev support” and show 2–3 concrete examples of funded builds.\n\nMeta: use broad interest buckets (startup, SaaS, Web3, indie hackers depending on your focus) with simple video or carousel that spells out eligibility and timeline.\n\nI’d also test niche channels: Indie Hackers classifieds, sponsor a couple of startup newsletters, Reddit via tools like Pulse plus things like Apollo/Clay to find founders already posting about funding and DM them with a short, specific pitch.\n\nCore point: prioritize channels where you can precisely target founders in “builder” mode, then use cheap experiments to find your best-quality traffic source.",

But if someone took my place I would rather die. My business is like my child and I've put multiple six figures into it.\n\nI KNOW I'm not built for a corporate job. And there ARE parts of what I do that I enjoy - I just can't seem to hold onto them under along with everything else. I know theoretically I have the power to shape this into something I love. I built it, so I should be able to rebuild it, right? But I have no clue how to get from where I am to where I want to be since I've gone so far.\n\nAnyone else been here?

The answer for me was figuring out how to do some of the work myself and also downsizing so I needed less help. I didn’t want to deal with firing my trusty employees that was the biggest issue but luckily a few of them ended up wanting to move on to different jobs anyway. The final step was I moved to a different state and closed my original office so that took care of another employee or two. Kinda just blamed it on the move and downsizing and they totally understood. \n\nAnyway, it was a long difficult transition but now I just have 2 employees - 1 of them is a salesperson who works remote and basically pays for herself and it’s very part time so no pressure, and the other is my spouse and we share our money so the salary thing doesn’t matter as much. I recognize this is a unique situation and might not be realistic for many businesses but it’s worked out beautifully. \n\nRegardless I think the sentiment of downsizing and doing more of the busy work yourself if possible is relatable. My dad was an entrepreneur and had the same issue but on a much larger scale but he said the same thing about there being a sweet spot when the business was smaller and then it all got messed up when he hired more people and expanded and everyone depending on him etc. \n\nidk your situation and if this is possible but hopefully it helps. \n\nAlso don’t sweat the employees depending on you and maybe needed to let some of them go, it’s just business not personal and in my experience the best thing you can do is give them a huge amount of time to figure out a different job if you do decide to downsize. I gave a couple employees like 3 months notice and they had new jobs secured before I actually wanted them to quit lol",

He describes three different business founder personalities, relevant for understanding the entrepreneurial myth. These are the Entrepreneur, the Manager, and the Technician, and typically one of these personalities is dominant in a founder.\n\nBottom line: YOU NEED HELP.\nMaybe one or two of your current employees can step into more leadership team type roles, where they can excel, while you focus on where you excel.

You've also said several yellow/red flags of common mistakes. \n\n\nI would highly recommend therapy and or a CEO coach, but first you need a week long vacation minimum where you don't answer any emails or check any work. No your company won't implode in 5 business days, but you will catch weaknesses in your processes.\n\n\nLet me address your yellow flags:\n\"Can't turn to anyone for help\". You absolutely can and should say \"I don't know\" followed by \"but I can help you find the answer\". Leadership is about learning and helping those around, not always already having the right answer.  Also you can find business owners, that are in similar spaces or promote/identify people on the team. I bounce ideas off other business owners, chances are the same problem you haven has happened millions of times before. \n\n\nYou absolutely can say \"I'm exhausted\". Literally you say \"hey guys I'm not feeling hot today so I may be a little slow in my response today\". We are whole human beings. In our weekly status meeting we would start with green yellow red for personal mood you could elaborate, but you didn't have to. \n\n\nyou're not responsible for the emotional state of everyone around you and your not solving for happiness. You shouldn't inflict panic or confusion but you absolutely can say \"Hey team that big job fell through so we are only going to have 10k in the bank at the end of this month, let's try to slow down non essentials\" if you give people more accurate information they can make more accurate decisions. \n\n\nI resented my company at one point. It usually means you're doing to much. I don't know your cost structure but go hire a chief of staff, coo, president etc. Let them run all the average business day to day and only focus where you add unique value. \n\n\n\"If someone took my place I would rather die\" HUGE red flag. You just said \"I don't want to grow and my ego is tied into this\". First at the end of the day this is about a lifestyle and money. There's nothing wrong about being at any size, but if you \"can't\" give up control you are acknowledging you will never scale past your personal bandwidth to make every important decision. I run two companies at the same time I absolutely give up as much work as possible to others. I'm there to inspire and pick strategy. I've already sold companies and lost them I'm at peace with any business.\n\n\n\"My business is like a child and I put six figures into it\" I'm confused is this a net positive venture? have you put in more than you've got out? Is this a viable business or a really expensive hobby? If you got your money out, hour much you put in makes no difference. If it's not cash for positive evaluate why. \n\n\nYes to answer your question I fell back in love my giving up everything I hated doing and dragging my feet on and only do the stuff I love and can add value. Best feeling was coming in when I wanted and leaving when I wanted because I was confident the team had it covered. I also have up control knowing people would do things differently, but it was my job to course correct not gate keep. \n\n\nPractical advise new company policy that every manager has to take off at least 4 days in a row once per quarter. Starting with your self. You need to step away and look at things objectively, and it prevents burnout.",

          "body": "Reading this, I hear someone whose nervous system has been under sustained responsibility for a long time. Being the person others depend on financially and emotionally activates something very primal. Over time, the work stops being experienced as creative or meaningful and starts being carried as a weight that never really comes off. The trapped feeling you describe often shows up when identity, responsibility, and safety become too tightly bound together. I see this all the time with the people I work with. When the business holds all of that at once, the system rarely gets to rest.  Resentment towards the company and the clients tends to appear when there has been no safe place to express uncertainty or exhaustion. If you’re always required to be the steady one, the honest parts of you get pushed into the background. Over time, that disconnect makes it harder to feel close to the work, even when parts of it are still meaningful.\nMany founders reach this stage because the business has grown beyond the internal structure that originally built it. What worked in the early years can become unsustainable when the stakes are higher and the responsibility wider. That shift often brings confusion rather than clarity, especially when there’s a sense that you should be able to handle it better by now.\n\nChange  is possible, but it usually unfolds once there is more internal safety and less pressure to hold everything together alone. Insight and motivation tend to return after the system feels supported, not before. You’re noticing something very common and real here , and you’re not the only one who reaches this point. Speaking it out loud is often the beginning of a necessary reorganisation, even if the next steps aren’t obvious yet",

Would anyone believe he didn't have connections to make it such a success?\n\nHeck, there was one financial guru, who did seem to have a reasonably level head, till he said he bought a Ford GT for \"$0 dollars\".  Yeahhhh, he kinda forgot to mention that it's only \"$0 dollars\" after the car would be sold.  Totally skipping the $275K he still needed to drop on it to get it in the first place, and let the appreciation take care of the 'cost'.  I stopped following him right after that.\n\nI mean, let's not even mention that when was the last time you saw a millionaire posting an add on Instagram to make you rich as well?  Hell, even Tony Robbin's stuff is more about 'feel good' methods than it is about anything else.  Does anyone thing he already doens't have enough money to deal with all the things he's doing?\n\nWhat we need are real guides and practices that actually work for where any of us are in our journeys.  Those are usually not glamorous or necessarily product any kind of significant income.  Most really help you fine-tune what we are(or in some cases are not) already doing.  That's not very 'sexy' to sell.\n\nEven Tim Ferris, and he's about the only one I feels gets it, wrote a book (The 4hr Work Week) was great for the time, but now is dated and now being 'remote' for work is pretty common.  (Not to mentioned being....errr...'enforced' in recent times.)\n\nThose of us who are struggling can't afford a $1000 course, or $200/month for 'group support'.  \n\nIs there an answer out there or someone who really gets it and shares real world facts and assistance that doesn't take away from beginners who are mostly flailing around?

One of the most important things is how this tool connects to Linkedin. If its extensions caught easiest, cloud tools use API calls, and Linkedin spot them, desktop software is safer.\n2. Depending on the technology type price changes drastically. Cloud tools cost way more, but often times you pay not for the safety, but for the fancy UI. (no offence if it’s a key feature for you)\n3. Limits, and the way the tool explains them. It’s like the main thing I pay attention to. Does it actually stop you from doing dumb stuff like 500 invites a day or just lets you set that and blames you when you get banned. This makes a huge difference if you are looking for the tool for a long term.\n4. Can it connect to your CRM without making things worse\n5. Will support actually help if LinkedIn sends you a warning\n\n\n\nWhat else should be on here?\n\n",

The best automation handles the repetitive parts (sending messages, follow-ups) but frees you up to focus on genuine engagement when someone responds.\n\n\n\nFor outreach beyond LinkedIn, consider multi-channel automation - SMS/WhatsApp can have even better response rates than LinkedIn messages, especially for local businesses.

          "body": "I'd add one more thing that caught me out early on: how the tool handles reply detection. Some cheaper ones keep auto-sending follow-ups even after someone responds, which looks terrible and burns relationships fast.  \n  \nAlso worth checking if the tool randomly varies timing between actions. If it's sending connection requests at exact intervals (like every 60 seconds on the dot), LinkedIn's algorithm picks up on that pattern pretty quickly.  \n  \nOn your point about limits, I've found the tools that force you to warm up your account gradually (like starting at 20-30 invites per day for new accounts) are actually the ones that keep you safer long term, even though it feels frustratingly slow at first.  \n  \nOne thing I'd push back on slightly though: automation works best for getting initial connections, but once someone accepts or replies, I've had way better results switching to manual, personalised messages rather than keeping everything in the sequence. The conversion difference is massive.  \n  \nAre you planning to run this yourself or have a VA handle it?",

LinkedIn is great for B2B lead gen, but many service businesses are finding more success with SMS/WhatsApp automation for customer communication - no risk of platform bans, direct to their phone, and customers actually prefer texting over LinkedIn messages.\n\n\n\nThe same safety principles apply though - use proper APIs, respect rate limits, and make sure the automation adds value rather than just blasting messages.

Even with rocket science though you could still probably find something scientists need and would pay for for example ... Point is. \n\nMy best tip would be do something you love. You don't need certifications or anything for it. Forget your skills too. This isn't a \"job\" youre being hired for or vetted for. Most things you'll need for a business you will learn as well by just doing it, so most of your skills are irrelevant most times... Just go with something you've always loved. \n\nSome people like shoes, others like plants. Others construction. Fashion. Business. Teaching. Cleanliness.  Sports. Logistics. Snacks &amp; beverage. Real estate. Manufacturing. Technology. Ceramics. Gloves. Pillows. Wine. \n\nWhat do you like? (Answer in your head this)\n\nIf you for instance like shoes... \n\nSet up a shoe store. Set up an app that finds you custom made shoes for people looking for it. Make a shoe polishing business. Make a business that makes special shoe laces. Make a business that does custom painted shoes. Make a business that exports exotic shoe laces. Whatever you want that you like. \n\nOnce you got that just don't stop, keep going, get into the space meet people doing what you want to do. If you're consistent you can get great results and move past failures and obstacles more easily as well as build a tangible product overtime. Finding product market fit is also a whole other beast... and whatever skills you have or whatever idea you choose will have little to do with actually trying to ship whatever you make out to the world. \n\nIt's gonna take lots of hard work, lots of failures probably, lots of discipline and consistency. If you wanna be in it for the long run pick something you like ideally ... Not just for money, focus on loving what you do. Because you might not see money for a while. \n\nAsking us what you can do is something you should know better than anyone. Do something you like, it's that simple. After you pick something get into those areas. If it's, say, selling shoes. You're not gonna be here with this question. You're gonna be talking to people who are into shoes. So what you're asking here is extremely vague and you won't get much out of it because no one knows you or is you so its not easy. Ideas are abundant. \n\nSo, maybe speak more about what you like. What do you like? Is there something youve always been into? Then we can help turn that into a more viable business to an extent. No one's gonna hold your hand doing anything. So this is the moment you start what is a largely self discovered journey. \n\n No one can give you specific ideas here because only you should know what feels best to you... Choose something you'll have the best chance of excelling at, choose something you like that will make you feel happy when you get that first paying customer and see their smile. Not for the money. But for what you did. Something that will pull you through the hard times. Because things WILL get hard... And it's that light of passion for what you do that gives you that tap on the back to keep going. Money as an incentive is often always really rough (this is the classic give me ideas that make money....). Most people who start for money burn out quick for that reason. Their morale dies out too fast when they don't see money. Only a rare minority gets driven enough by it and actually succeeds. Best tip. Choose what you like. \n\nThe best things of people I've seen done always had some sort of initial passion for it or \"epiphany\" moment doing somethig that ignited a spark. \n\nModern vacuums for instance .. done by a guy who got fed up of his manual vacuum so he went through about 5,000 prototypes to get to what we use today. He probably didn't just sit to ask \"what should I do I need ideas\". Very different process. Lots of the best things done today happened like that. Lots of businesses same thing. \n\n Can change your life if you understand this.",

So I would just go straight with those skills and offer some kind of translation service, you are learning Computer Science so focusing on the Software Industry is probably a great Idea.\n\nGeneral things to think about for you:\n1. Only start 1 business, not multiple.\n2. A service Business is for sure your best option.\n3. There are Service Businesses for low and high Skills, cutting some grass is easy to learn, translating between languages is hard to learn. This means, there is no excuse or reason for you to not start *any* business at all, but you should keep in mind that we Entrepreneurs get paied for solving hairy problems. The more uncomfortable the problem and the harder or more annoying it is to solve, the higher are the prices you can ask for.\n\nI think those are the three main points you need to know to get a clear mind and set a focus, but I encourage you to ask me as many questions as you need, in order to make a decision.\n\nFinally I want to be honest with you about one thing, you are not to old to start a business, but it will absolutely become harder for you if you wait any longer. We trade skills for money, if we have no skills, we trade time to learn skills. The older we get, the less time we have each day to invest.",

          "body": "I feel you. I'm 31, and have been trying to build my own business for several years. There's so much generic advice out there. Sometimes I feel like to \"make it\" as an entrepreneur you need a literal invention, funding / bags of cash, or luck. I've not \"made it\" by any means, but I've definitely learnt some lessons so far:\n\n1. To come up with an idea, you need to observe. Dedicate like min 10% of your constant conscious thoughts to entrepreneurial thinking. Why do they do that? Is there a way to make that better? Does a solution exist for this? Stupid example: see a bunch of people sat on the pavement eating lunch when you know round the corner there's empty benches -&gt; do people not have access to nearby outdoor seating area knowledge? Is there an app does / could do this? Vocalise it and stir up discussion within your circle. Most of my friends get lowkey annoyed at how much I do this, but you need to gear your brain to find problems for you to solve. Get used to coming up with lots of ideas, no matter how dumb, because most of them will not make it past the next thing I'm gonna say.\n\n2. Once you have an idea, try your hardest to tear it down. I've spent a year working on something that I was too proud to admit nobody wanted - at least in the way I was delivering it. Don't let ChatGPT put your idea on an imaginary pedestal. Try your best to find out what \\*doesn't\\* work with your idea. Competitors, cost to run it, access to data, or even if people actually want it.\n\n3. Get feedback from possible users. This is my most recent failure. I built something that I was so sure would be useful to people, but never bothered to ask my target users - I thought I'd build it first then market it, and someone would buy it. In reality, it's pretty hard to get your first customers - they want reviews, but everyone's too busy to help give reviews. Still working this one out. I'm going to try offer lifetime free subs for beta testers? If this works I'll check back in and tell you. \n\n4. You need patience. This isn't for everyone and I can't tell you how many times I've felt so sh\\*t about myself and my ideas after another failure or just the grind of having to push on with the dream after so little reward. It's not cost me huge amounts of money - it's cost me my time. Some people might get lucky with knowing the right things or having the right ideas, but not me! I'm in it for the long haul, and maybe by the time I'm 40 I'll get my break.\n\nI have no doubt that everyone can make it in this business, but you need to love it, love the process, and be willing to go the distance. I guarantee you you're more talented than you think, and that you'll uncover the skills you need to make it happen. Believe in yourself, your abilities, your work ethic. I'm sure you can make it happen.",

It was a small B2C SaaS that was already making around **$500/month**. Nothing crazy as such, but it was real revenue.\n\nAnd that I exited at 6 figures.\n\nSince then, I’ve bought **5 more businesses**, all for **under $10k**, and every one of them was already making money when I bought it.\n\nI don’t come from a finance background. I wasn’t rich. I just spent time looking for small deals most people ignore.\n\nOne big reason I prefer buying instead of starting from scratch:  \nyou’re not guessing if the idea will work.\n\nThe business already exists. Customers are already paying. There’s way less uncertainty compared to starting something new where you’re testing everything from zero.\n\nIf a bought business doesn’t work out, you usually still have options - improve it, fix obvious issues, or even sell it again. That feels way less risky to me than pouring months (or years) into something that may never make a dollar.\n\nEven while writing this, I can see **dozens of small businesses with revenue** selling for just a few thousand dollars.\n\nWhat actually matters isn’t being rich or “qualified.” It’s more about finding decent deals, being willing to take action (Execution is really imp), negotiating the right price and keep on iterating once you own it, etc. \n\nThere are a lot of businesses out there where **you’d be a better operator than the current owner**.",

      "selftext": "Hello, entrepreneurs!\n\nSo, it's been over a year since I left my job and started working for myself. My main focus is renovating kitchens and bathrooms (doing it for more than 10 years). Have a small team that I've been working with since the very beginning (we were employed together and decided to leave together), and a few more teams that I hired relatively recently.\n\nAt first, attracting customers was not an issue - word of mouth and contacts from my previous job took care of that, but then we realized that we couldn't grow that way.  \nTo solve that we created a website and started social media accounts, but that didn't help much, so we resorted to the services of SEO and SMM specialists. There were some results, but nothing impressive. Something else caught our attention: many customers said they found us in AI search results when they asked for recommendations on who to contact for repairs in California (we are based here). We didn't understand what was going on, but then it dawned on us - some articles from our website were randomly appearing in neural network search results.\n\nHere's my question: how does AI visibility optimization work? Is it possible to influence it in any way? Is it ethical?\n\nAnd this brings up another topic: how much sense does it make to focus specifically on AI SEO optimization to increase LLM brand visibility, instead of classic SEO? Is classic SEO dead in 2026?\n\nIn general, I was very impressed by how many people say they found us in ChatGPT, and now I want to figure it out, but don't understand how it works or where to start.\n\nSorry if my post is too confusing. Thank you!",

Profits weren't the goal.  Every penny of cash we had was cycled back into bizdev ( govt contracting speak for sales and marketing).  The bizes were grown to be sold and one of the metrics for biz valuation was 1x sales.  We wanted sales more than profits.  My partner and I were not even the highest paid employees because our short term personal income was not the priority.   \n\nYour advice fits a lot of businesses, but there's very good reasons that it won't fit all businesses.",

Replacing $20k/mo in year one is possible but statistically rare unless you already have distribution or you’re selling a high-ACV B2B product where a handful of customers gets you there.\n\n\n\nWhat I’ve seen work with family/mortgage is: don’t quit, but aggressively reshape consulting. Raise rates, move to retainers, cut scope, and aim for 2 to 3 “good” clients max so you can buy back 10 to 15 hours a week consistently. Then treat SaaS like a pipeline with weekly output targets (customer calls, outbound, content, partnerships), because the real bottleneck usually isn’t building, it’s distribution.\n\n\n\nAlso, don’t “kill” the SaaS based on time, kill it based on signals: if you can’t find a niche that feels acute pain, can’t get people to pay, or churn stays ugly after you’ve iterated with real users. Four months is basically still the learn-what-to-sell phase, so the more realistic question is whether you can get to meaningful revenue in 12 to 24 months while consulting less, not whether you can fully replace $20k by December.",

Don't quit until SaaS hits maybe 30 to 40% of your consulting income AND is growing.\n\nThe \"save runway and quit\" approach works if you're single with low expenses. With family and mortgage? Too risky.\n\nAlso consider: your SaaS doesn't need to replace 21k. It needs to replace your minimum viable lifestyle. What's the actual number where you're fine, not comfortable but fine? That's your real target.\n\n4 months is nothing for SaaS. Most take 18 to 24 months to get real traction. The ones that blow up fast are survivorship bias.\n\nDon't kill it yet.

          "body": "I’m on the same journey, similar circumstances. In my 7th year. Started as 100% consulting in something I had direct experience in, and I slowly started building a product, starting end of year 1. I couldn’t build a product to replace what I did exactly, but I could build one to supplement the services I offered.\n\nI would do the normal contracts, then see if I could sell the product to solve a small but recurring pain point. It was a small problem to solve, but necessary, so while the subscription revenue was small it wasn’t too hard a sell.\n\nI found it was more important to get my foot in the door as a SaaS vendor than to worry about the money. Because, over time, the product features grew and I already had the relationship. Upselling is often much easier than new sales. \n\nProduct development started to turbo charge early last year, thanks to LLMs, while development cost flat lined or even shrunk. It was difficult to find time to code when I had high paying billable work, so it happened in spurts throughout the year during otherwise slower periods. \n\nI did have an employee who both consulted and coded, they were an entry level hire so while it took a lot of time to train them, they weren’t too expensive while having low utilization. I too had projects only I could do, for whatever reason, so I had to win new, smaller ones, for him. While he certainly helped move the product along, 4 years and many raises in, he was mostly break even and started to under perform, resulting in him being let go. \n\nI hired a part time engineer and an in house accountant-trained-consultant, both off shore. Engineer was good, though financially questionable decision given SaaS revenue. Accountant/Consultant was the best decision I ever made. \n\nUltimately picked up most of the development myself as my employee gained enough experience to replace me on 60% of work. \n\nThe consulting we do, while still majority of revenue, has fully transitioned to consulting on an area of past experience, to 100% on our own product about 3-4 years in. Great for sticky customers and flexible staffing. By year 4 or 5 it all felt stable. \n\nLong story short, diversify customer base and hire / train. Cut back on expenses and re-invest as much as you can into training and product dev. It’s risky, especially if someone you train for a year leaves, or turns out to be a bad fit, but it works. Plan in terms of 3,5,7,10 year milestones, and don’t expect big results in weeks or months. \n\nAt least, this was my experience 🤷🏻‍♂️",

Here's what actually worked:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The uncomfortable truth first:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nYou probably won't replace $20k/month SaaS income in year one. The realistic path is more like: maintain consulting income as long as possible while building product leverage, then gradually shift the ratio as the product proves itself.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What the successful transitions I've seen look like:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Don't quit consulting - productize parts of it first\\*\\*\n\n   \\- What repetitive deliverables do you give clients? Can any become templates, tools, or automated solutions?\n\n   \\- Your existing clients are your first potential SaaS customers or at minimum your beta testers\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*The \"runway\" question is the wrong frame\\*\\*\n\n   \\- Instead of \"save X months then go all-in,\" think \"reduce consulting hours by 20% when SaaS hits $2k MRR, then by another 20% at $5k MRR\"\n\n   \\- This gives you feedback loops instead of a cliff\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Kill criteria for the SaaS:\\*\\*\n\n   \\- If after 6 months of consistent effort you have &lt; $1k MRR and flat/declining growth, that's a pivot signal\n\n   \\- But \"4 months and nowhere close\" might just mean you haven't found distribution yet. SaaS growth usually doesn't start until month 6-12\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Specific tactics:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*Raise your consulting rates by 20-30%\\*\\*: Either clients pay more (giving you more runway per hour worked) or some leave (freeing up time). Win either way.\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*Shift to retainer-only consulting\\*\\*: Project work is unpredictable. Retainers give you predictable income AND time blocks.\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*One day per week non-negotiable\\*\\*: Protect SaaS time like a client meeting. If you don't, consulting will always eat it.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The family factor:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nWith mortgage and family, the \"quit and figure it out\" stories aren't your playbook. The boring answer is: you do both, longer than feels comfortable, until the SaaS can actually support you. Usually 18-24 months, not 12.\n\n\n\nWhat does your SaaS do, and what's your current MRR/user count after 4 months?",

Today, I am pushed into a corner where I am afraid to do anything or try out something new, and I can feel the walls closing in.\n\nI am doing deliveries and other blue-collar gigs because it makes me happy, and it’s the only time I don't think about my failure. Looking back, I think I had a big ego when I had success. I loved being generous and taking care of people, but being in a position where I'm not able to do so, I don’t want to face anyone.\n\nMy brain is not able to think big right now or come up with ideas; it is in a stagnant state, I feel. And I think I went out of business at the worst time possible, because even the job market in IT is fed up.\n\nWhat I’ve learned during this time upon reflecting:\n\n* I truly understand the essence of networking.\n* Grit doesn’t always mean things will go well; you need a pragmatic thinker on your team who talks to you openly.\n\nAnyways, I have decided, in this Arab?Arabi?c restaurant, that I am going to start again. I have nothing to lose. I am starting at 0 today; 0 capital and 0 funding.\n\nJust my laptop, a roof over my head, and my bike. My trusty bike, the only thing putting food on my table right now. I love my bike; a stupid machine on two wheels, haha.\n\nI don’t have the \"big idea\" yet. I am going to take a different approach to building this time, something that gets me from 0 to 1.

I once spent 3 hours at dinner listening to him giving me a line by line breakdown about how much he hated Quickbooks. \n\nThe reason why you hear about crypto, dropshipping, and AI so much online is because most people who think they're interested in making money, are looking for ways to make money without much work. Everything you listed is easy to create a course to sell to those dreamers. \n\nMeanwhile there are thousands of possible businesses. \n\nIf you are interested in a local service business - ask ChatGPT for a list of local professions. Then start Googling them. Pay attention to every business in every strip mall area you drive by. Look at every vehicle that has a business name on it. \n\nResearch \"boring businesses\" - this was the hip entrepreneur term for 2025. It means businesses like lawn care that can earn alot of money but doesn't get the press the way an AI startup will. \n\nAnother option -listen to My First Million episode 779 - about franchises.

I told her I have hired hundreds of people and my gut tells me I would not hire this guy. Well, she hired him. He has sucked. Everyone came in today but he said he couldn't get out of the neighborhood because of the bad roads.... we live near him and our roads were fine and all the roads all over town were fine. He does the least he can do. He takes 2 hour lunches if my wife is out of the office. \n\nSo before bed I asked.... if he don't come in tomorrow are you going to fire him? She said, \"YEP\".

For booking, Calendly or Cal.com (free) embed directly on your site and handle everything.

On the site itself just make sure your city and service keywords are in the page titles and headings naturally. Like \"Nutrition Coaching in [Your City]\" type stuff.

Here are the ones I can think of:\n\n* Email &amp; linkedin automation to generate leads: We have used tools like Clay to automate outbound emails and linkedin DMs to let them book a call with our sales team! This was something our team used to manually do- but automation has basically allowed them to take more sales call without worrying about this repeative task that used to take atleast 2 hours daily! Massive savings imo\n* SEO automation: Again, we noticed our SEO agency was basically just looking at our Google search data and industry keywords to come up with content answering specific questions customers were already asking on Google so that we became the top result! We were easily able to automate this using AI tools like Frizerly to get the same results for 1/10th the cost! This also translates to getting mentioned on both ChatGPT and AI overview as the go to tool for various questions! So again, this is saving us both agency fee and getting us actual customers over time!\n* Support automation: Once of the core problems we have had is customers often dont real our FAQs or website and ask the same question over and over again! Using tools like Sierra, we have been able to instantly auto resolve these questions! Others are still routed to a real support person! Saves our support team so much time now!\n* Quarterly Customer Reports: Lastly but not least, we used to send quarterly report presentations to all our customers based on our analytics for our tool helps them with to show ROI basically! We have been able to automate this almost completely using Gamma! We still review them and make ended before sending it their way- but saves 80% time for our team!\n\nFollowing to see what else others have been automation :)",

I made a tool for myself where I just enter my client's website, and it just spits out a fully revamped website that I just paste into Lovable. So I'm just mostly copy-pasting now, and prompting maybe a bit here and there, but often times I don't even prompt. \n\nThis allows me to give clients free homepage redesigns because its now quite fast for me. It's getting a lot of orders, nearly daily, but I wouldn't say its like super high ROI. \n\nI'm still new to sales, and web design, so I have to communicate better in my emails, and say the right things, but at least I'm seeing traction now. \n\nSo I can't say for sure if this path is super solid. But from what I'm intuiting, now that I'm getting clients (for free homepage redesigns daily) is that I can now move on to the phase where I'm focused on improving my selling skills, etc. \n\nI think also web design is hot now because of Gemini 3 Pro. Like the websites Lovable makes is pretty okay. They trained a small custom model to keep it cheap from my understanding. But Gemini 3 Pro is so amazing at website design. Try it out. That's what made me want to offer that to clients, and the excitement is pretty high for the free homepage redesigns. \n\nFor context I used to offer phone agents, and cold email engines. I would get like 2 replies per month from my cold emails. And many would just have negative sentiment to my cold emails. But with free homepage redesigns, people are actually excited, and appreciative, mostly because you're doing something for free (another key thing) and its something they need. \n\nSo when you talk about high ROI, I think we need to think in terms of a funnel. My focus is solving one part of the funnel at a time. If you just want high ROI, you're going to feel lost because the whole funnel is like a system you need to design and tweak. High ROI = improving every part of the system, not just the automation you offer. I'm still yet to see how this plays out, but I feel like I solved one part of the system now.",

Many people try to think or plan their way into action (increase success chance and lower effort), so you go through a loop of alternative action (productive procrastination) as a way to avoid the real task.\n\nThe answer: listening and learning to see what part of your mind is talking.   \nIm glad that you got out of the loop this time, but this anxious avoidant part of the mind will try to strike again.   \nThink of your mind as different parts of you. The brain loves being efficient, and doing as little action as possible. So it will first use distractions (craving to watch content or daydream). Secondly, it will use emotions (Tiredness when you sit to work, brain fog). Third it will use logic (\"I can take a cheat day\" or \"Maybe it would be better if I planned X out\"). Lastly it will try to use any addictive or paralyzing thing on you (becoming horny, anxiety, mental breakdown, heavy brain fog)  \n  \nYour goal: Find where the mind is leading you with every thought and emotion, it's not always on your side.  \nDiscipline (scientifically) is actually just the act of observing these conflicts of interest, the longer you see that your brain works this way, the better chance you have at not falling for its tricks, and doing what's correct. Learn to find the pattern of logic and anxiousness that leads away from your one very clear goal (make $100k, get 10,000 users) just have a clear goal and don't let any logic get in that way\n\ndm if you want any more advice or details",

      "selftext": "This might piss some people off, but I need to say it. I ran a personal branding agency for three years. I had clients, I had a team, and I made decent money. I called myself an entrepreneur everywhere, on LinkedIn, on Twitter, and even in my Tinder bio. One day, a friend asked me a simple question: “What happens to your income if you stop working for two weeks?” I said, “It stops.” He laughed and said, “Bro, you’re not an entrepreneur. You’re self-employed with a fancy title.” That hit me hard. When I really thought about it, I realised my agency was mostly just me trading time for money, only with a few extra steps. I was not building an asset and I was not creating something that could run without me. I was basically a freelancer who hired other freelancers. The uncomfortable truth is that, in India, almost everyone with a laptop and two clients calls themselves an entrepreneur, agency owners, freelancers, even people who made one dropshipping sale. The word has been watered down so much that it has started to lose its meaning. To me, real entrepreneurs build systems that create value without their constant involvement, build assets that can be sold, and take real risk with capital, not only with their time. Running an agency taught me many useful skills, but it also taught me one important lesson: being busy is not the same as building something. I am not saying agencies are bad, I am only saying that having clients does not automatically make someone an entrepreneur. It is a different game. I am still trying to figure out what real entrepreneurship looks like for me, but at least now I have stopped lying to myself. Anyone else had this realisation, or am I being too harsh on myself and others?                                                                   ",

Two patterns jumped out immediately. One became the basis for something I could actually build and step away from.  \n  \nYou've got three years of signal sitting in your client work. The answer to \"what should I build\" is almost certainly in there - which problems kept showing up, which solutions you kept rebuilding from scratch, where clients got disproportionate results.

          "body": "I don’t think you’re being harsh. I think you’re being precise, and precision can feel uncomfortable when it removes comforting labels.\n\nWhat your friend pointed out is real. Many people, especially online, use “entrepreneur” to mean “I don’t have a boss.” But independence and entrepreneurship aren’t the same thing. Self-employed people sell their time. Entrepreneurs build something that can keep creating value when they step away. Different games, different rules.\n\nThat said, I’d be careful not to swing too far into self-flagellation.\n\nRunning an agency is not fake work. You learned sales, delivery, hiring, client psychology, cash flow, and responsibility. Those are not trivial skills. The mistake isn’t that you ran an agency. The mistake would be thinking those years were wasted because the business wasn’t an asset.\n\nMost people who eventually build real leverage start exactly where you did. They first trade time for money. Then they notice the ceiling. Then they get uncomfortable. That discomfort is usually the signal that it’s time to evolve, not to invalidate the past.\n\nAlso, the definition of entrepreneur is a bit more nuanced than social media makes it. Plenty of real businesses start as time-bound services and only later turn into systems, products, or sellable assets. The transition is the hard part, not the label.\n\nThe important shift you’ve already made is this one: you’re no longer confusing being busy with building something. That’s huge. Most people never catch that.\n\nInstead of asking “Was I ever really an entrepreneur?”, a more useful question might be “What would need to change for this work to become an asset?” Systems, productization, delegation, or eventually moving beyond services entirely.\n\nYou weren’t lying to yourself before. You were early. Now you’re clearer. That’s progress, even if it doesn’t feel flattering yet.",

Learn a skill that compounds, keep your costs low, avoid locking yourself into massive debt early, and stay flexible. College can be part of that, but it shouldn’t be sold as a golden ticket anymore.

But I found that I hit a ceiling in my own building/hustling where I simply lacked the deep, foundational theory to build the things I really wanted to build.\n\nRight now, I’m running a side project (a Rails PWA for audio journaling) *while* doing the degree. The \"hustle\" mindset helps me ship the product and find users, but the university education is giving me the math and structure to actually make the backend defensible.\n\nWe should probably tell 18-year-olds: Go to college if you want to master a complex domain (Engineering, Medicine, Hard Sciences). Start a side hustle if you want to learn sales and resilience. The danger is thinking you can swap one for the other perfectly. You usually need both (in my humble opinion!).",

If you were required to have spent time in a place other than where you grew up, interacting with people different than you. If before you could study a subject you needed to spend at least a year working in an entry level position of that field, so, for example, you couldn't study medicine until you had spent a year as a hospital orderly, or even better, the path towards becoming a doctor required you to first get a nursing degree, and work for several years in nursing first, we would have much better doctors.\n\nOne of the reasons why builders hate architects so much is that they so often have no practical experience.

          "body": "I tell people this all the time: starting with zero money is actually one of the best positions you can be in. When you start with nothing, there’s almost no risk. I’ve been doing it that way since I was 14.\n\nThe first thing anyone should do is sit down and write out all the skills they already have. Real skills. Things you know how to do that someone else would pay for. Most people underestimate this part.\n\nFor example, fixing computers. It sounds outdated, but even in 2026 it’s often cheaper to fix a slow computer or remove viruses than to buy a new one. People will gladly pay $100 to get their computer back running smoothly, and they’re happy when they get it back.\n\nI’ve seen the same thing with simple services. A friend of mine started a mobile oil change business using his mom’s van. He’d drop her off at work, post ads on Craigslist, and spend the day driving around changing oil. That was it. Four, five, sometimes six oil changes a day. It worked because people value convenience.\n\nThe point is, you don’t need capital to start. You use the skills you already have and the tools already around you. When I was 14, I used my parents’ lawnmower, walked door to door cutting grass, and reinvested until I had multiple mowers and help. Eventually, we had over 30 yards, and I sold the entire client list to a larger landscaping company for thousands of dollars.\n\nThere are opportunities everywhere. You just have to stop waiting for money, permission, or the “perfect idea,” and start being creative with what you already have.",

I avoided chilling with people my age because I knew we were all broke. Always chilled with the older gen. And when I didn't have a laptop to do the work I was given one free(God is Great) and also given money to actually do the business.. full on support. If I messed up I received guidance instead of being made fun of. Change the people you chill with. Also run from places with Alcohol and drugs. You find the right people just by being you and choosing the type of people you want to be around. Eventually you just meet the same type of people over and over. Just be of value. Learn digital marketing too. It's the best way to get yourself recurring income but don't sell Bullshit services. Give your clients solutions that work and grow their business. Age is just a number and raw action beats talent. In my opinion you need $0 to start a digital marketing service. In the US people charge $1200 for managing a social media account. It's just skill bro and the ability to communicate.",

That's the whole point of coaching and consulting. Zero overhead. No inventory. Just your knowledge.\n\nBut here's where people mess up.\n\n\"Free resources\" will teach you WHAT to do. But they won't show you HOW to execute fast. I wasted YEARS piecing together YouTube videos. Sold a $47 product when I should've been charging $1,500+. Worked my ass off for pennies.\n\nThe real question isn't \"can you do it with $0\" but \"how much is your time worth?\"\n\nIf you're dead broke? Cool. Grind it out with free stuff. It'll take 2 to 3 years instead of 6 to 12 months, but you'll get there if you're obsessed.\n\nBut the SECOND you start making money? Invest in yourself. People who are 10 steps ahead can save you YEARS of mistakes.\n\nHere's what I'd do today with $0:\n\nPick a niche. Let's say fitness. Go to Instagram. Find 10 people posting about wanting to lose weight. DM them. Offer a free consultation. Book 5 calls. On those calls, pitch a 12 week program for $1,500. Close ONE person. You just made more than most people make in a month.\n\nThen deliver results. Get them to lose 5+ pounds week one. Build momentum.\n\nTake that money and reinvest. Run ads. Hire a VA. Scale from there.\n\nThe only real risk is waiting. Every day you're \"learning\" instead of doing is another day you're broke.",

If your team is in person I can't recommend it enough, and if they're not then I would honestly arrange some sort of online scavenger hunt or trivia they can work together on. You can give them small, inexpensive prizes throughout and then like everyone else suggested a bonus at the end. \nThis does depend on your budget though. If you don't have the budget to give a decent chunk of change then give them a great experience to show you care.\n\n\nMy staff honestly works hard and despite how infuriating managing people can be, my income is because of them.\n\n\nHalloween this year I turned our business into a haunted house (I do this every year with a different theme/story). For our party I set up an elaborate scavenger hunt where a witch had put a curse on the business and they had to work together to find parts of an incantation they could use to summon the witch who cursed us and vanquish her. Lights out, only lit by electronic tea lights which they had to form into a circle and stand inside of to summon the witch once they found all the parts of the incantation. I had my dad and a friend dress up in some gnarly/hideous witch costumes and scare them. Used blue tooth speakers and some animatronics along the way. Last year it was my BIL hiding in the furnace room with a mask and a machete. Hearing them scream honestly just warms my heart every year. It's honestly so cathartic and they have SO much fun and talk about it with all of our clients and their friends and family.\n\n\nI skipped Christmas this year because everyone was sick but I was going to have a krampus come in and scare them. Saving it for next year.\n\n\nValentines is on the 7th and I'm doing a high tea for them, dress code is the fancier, the better. I've designed a giant galentine's (we're all women) board game for them which is actually coming along and will be so good! They work through toxic masculinity, toxic femininity, women's health and social issues (just board game spaces, not actually and I've kept it funny and unserious) and at the end of the game, the last square is \"Self Actualization\". To get there they have to roll dice, square off in trivia and activities like flip cup, summon each other for help with scavenger tasks where they can all work together to advance on the board.\n\n\nThe board game pieces are instax photos of them that will be taken when they arrive for the party. Small prizes like chocolates and lip gloss, hair clips etc...throughout the game and the winner gets a teddy bear, heart earings, and a tote bag. \n\n\nI share all this because I AM SO EXCITED for it but also because it will cost around $500 and be a great party. It's a team of 10 right now and a $50 cash bonus would really just be lame, so for them this is much more fun with the budget. It gets everyone talking about the business in a fun and positive way. People who don't work for me keep trying to get invites but we are excluuuusive!\n\nTeam does $40k - $50k monthly. If you're creative you can honestly still put something fun together on a scrappy budget. I'm all up in the dollar store for these things.\n\nEditing to add that I also had a fortune teller come in for the Halloween party and do tarot readings for them! Also doing mini photoshoots at the Galentine's party 🥳",

      "selftext": "I sell handmade leather goods, been in business 4 years now. Guy bought a wallet from me back in July. Full price, no complaints at purchase, left a nice review saying he loved it.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. He emails me saying he wants a full refund because the wallet \"didn't meet his expectations.\" I ask what's wrong with it. Is the stitching coming undone? Leather cracking? Hardware failing? Nope. He says he just \"realized it's not really his style anymore\" and thinks he should get his money back.\n\nI politely explained that my return policy is 30 days and that doesn't cover changing your mind half a year later after using the product daily. The wallet isn't defective. He just doesn't want it anymore.\n\nHis response? \"I'll be leaving a review reflecting my experience with your customer service.\"\n\nSo now I'm sitting here trying to decide what to do. Part of me wants to just refund him to avoid the bad review. I'm a small operation and every review matters. But the other part of me knows that if I cave to this, I'm basically telling him and anyone else that they can use my products for free as long as they threaten me at the end.\n\nMy policy is clearly stated on my website. The product isn't faulty. He used it for 6 months. But a 1 star review could genuinely hurt me.\n\nBeen up late playing jackpot city trying to distract myself from stressing about this, keep going back and forth on what to do. For those who've dealt with this kind of thing - do you stand firm and eat the bad review, or do you just pay the extortion fee to make it go away? I genuinely don't know what the right call is here anymore.",

Then I realize it's just not worth it to interact with the lowest of society.\n\nI'll give you an example. I had a bunch of items in a basket which are priced by grade and weight. Someone came up with a sticker from another item and claimed it was from their item. I know my products and told her there's no way that sticker was correct. She insisted up and down that I was wrong going on and on and on. Saying she would never cheat etc etc. She really ran me around and had me questioning things. \n\nI gave it to her for the sticker price knowing I was getting taken , and when she left I watched the video and saw her remove the sticker from one item and put it on to her item secretively. I was so freakng furious that she put me through all that and then lying to my face and using every skill that I've developed over years against me. \n\n15 minutes later I saw her walking across the street with her man and a 6-year-old son. They both had a sort of urban pride , he looked tough and had tattoos \netc. I walked over and waited to intercept. As they approached I held my phone out to her and said \"excuse me is this you changing my price tags?\"  She responded very authoritatively \"We're NOT doing this right now.\"  The gaul on this one.  \n\nSo I gave it to her. Called her a liar and a thief and shouted to the crowd on the sidewalk as much, pointing to her.  It became a big scene with her man defending her and me telling him his woman is a lying thief.  There was a lot of shouting and they never admitted to anything.\n\nI returned to my store glad that I called them out, but more frustrated than ever that they flat out denied everything. 5 minutes later she comes in saying she wants to return it. She apparently realizes that there may be legal consequences and wants to get out of the transaction now. I told her it's stolen merchandise I don't want it. She ended up leaving it outside my store just to get out of the situation.  I didn't touch it because I legit didn't want to have anything to do with it at that point. I don't want to sell something that has that energy on it when someone is trying to buy something nice and new. The item she finagled me on was a $30 large  handcrafted heart made of gemstone and people often ask questions about where it's from, etc etc..\n\nAfter I settled down I thought about how ultimately draining and pointless the interaction was. Yes it's good for people to be called out, but at the same time it's not worth it to get involved with people and their sh!tty lives.\n\nI can usually get people to admit the truth and enjoy exposing the lies, however after sitting I realized many cultures have a thing about losing face in public and will never admit to anything as a rule.  So when you're interacting with another culture you may be crossing lines for them that are more severe then their original action. I enjoy the justice of confrontation and tactfully push what I think I can, stopping just short of their fuse in a violent response. I'm never looking to get physical with people.\n\nSo this is perhaps a long winded way of saying do what works best for you. I think in your case if you have one or two customers a year like that it may be worth it to work with them to avoid issues. However I would make it clear in no uncertain terms to shame them in the process and say \"look what you're doing is completely unreasonable and wrong frankly, but I just don't want to deal with you right now\", \n\nI serve tens of thousands of customers every year. I've had the most idiotic confused people leave terrible reviews after being total rejects you wouldn't believe it. The unfortunate truth is that every single time, these people turn it around on you. They project their bad behavior on you like a scheming 12-year-old. As preposterous as that sounds, that's what happens every time. And then of course you also have to protect yourself against them having a social media following who may dox you or barrage your page with negative reviews. Sucks but that's the world we live in.\n\nI would take your ego out of it and do what is the best for your business.",

Those that are recommending that the OP tell the customer to pound sand, how would you respond to a review like this:\n\n&gt;I was really excited to purchase a hand-made wallet from Acme Wallets.  I've been tired of buying crap on Amazon and being unhappy with it.  I long for the nostalgia of the old days where handmade goods lasted decades and you chose a \"wallet\" for life.\n\n&gt;Unfortunately, this was not my experience with the wallet I bought from Acme Wallets.  I paid nearly five times as much for this wallet, and I felt that the quality just wasn't there.  Every day, I took the wallet out and used it, and I got irritated because I spent so much money on this thing and was so bitterly disappointed.  The stitching was off, the configuration of the wallet was odd, and after six months, the colors started to fade on one side and not the other.  Again, very disappointed.\n\n&gt;I contacted Acme Wallets to express my concerns, and asked to return the wallet after about six months of frustrating use.  They basically told me that there was a 30-day return policy and there were no exceptions made.  Even though they claim on their website that they stand behind their products, in the end, I really felt like the value and quality of the wallet wasn't worth the price.  I tried - I really tried to like it, but every day, it kept reminding me of how much I feel I overspent on this.  I would have expected this response from some Asia-sourced vendor on Amazon, but not one here.\n\n&gt;Disappointed, and now the wallet is heading to the pile to be donated to Goodwill.  Buyer beware.\n\nOkay - I'll challenge  here.  How would a business owner respond to a review like this?  This would be devastating to the business.  Is it worth it to risk a customer posting something like this?  Everything posted above is the opinion of the customer, which is impossible to effectively argue with (everyone is entitled to their opinion).  \n\nIf the customer is unhappy with your product, and is not using it, then there is something inherently wrong with the product meeting his expectations.  You do \\*not\\* want someone with unmet expectations with your product posting a product review.  Plain and simple.\n\nBottomline, refund the customer - the cost of a single wallet is not worth the risk of receiving a review like this that would seriously damage your business.",

Every day it’s something small that quietly stacks. Pricing tweaks. One difficult customer. A hire that’s good but not great. A cost increase you didn’t plan for. A gut feeling you can’t fully explain.\n\nThere’s no boss to say “you’re overthinking this.” No coworker to share the weight. Even when you have people around you, the final call is still yours. And if it goes wrong, that’s on you too.\n\nWhat messes with me is that people assume once your business is “working,” the stress goes away. It doesn’t. It just changes shape. Less panic, more background pressure.\n\nI don’t regret starting at all.

The inspection said nothing was wrong but the customer was worried about what might happen in the future due to a small detail that can be normal.

I know that’s easy for me to say, but I know people who have jobs working as teachers or maybe in sales or it could be any job that has a lot of stress we’re from the outside looking in I can’t figure it out…. But of course, I realized we’re all built differently in the stresses come from the same place just because you don’t own a business doesn’t mean you’re not gonna have stress.\n\nSo it’s not necessarily a business thing, even though that might be your trigger, it could be one of a plethora of things\n\nI remember talking to a guy once who owned a business that was pretty successful and he joked that the reason why a lot of guys go to happy hour and get a little drunk is to shut their brains off\n\nBut that’s not just business owners that’s a lot of people who go to happy hour, but you do have certain stresses but I think most of us overtime kind of learned you can’t sweat the small stuff\n\n\nAnd I found that most of the time I have a lot of stress it is over something really dumb. It might be something I have six weeks to get done but every day I put it off till tomorrow it just starts weighing on me and then when I actually do it it takes 15 minutes and I’m wondering why I just didn’t do it in the first place.\n\n\nI’m graded calling people back, but a lot of people have stressed because they aren’t good at that. I tend to get a little stressed out this time of the year because it’s my slowest time of year at work and I even had a little better than average January though that’s not saying much you always worry that business is gonna pick up again when it always has starting around March\n\nBut then I asked myself if I could be doing more to market to a broader base of customers, and I obviously could and I do a little bit, but not as much as I should so I create some of that dress as well, but then I have the problem of when I am busy I have a hard time keeping up because it’s feast or famine or so it seems\n\nBut I just try not to stress out on things I can’t control and set proper expectations and I guess when I’m extremely busy I’m so much more productive and I’m actually so much less stress stressed. Just because I’m occupied all day long getting things done when I’m slow I have too much dead time.\n\nAnd I can tell you being on Reddit is awful for people’s mental health or any social media so that’s just something to consider as well",

I built it from nothing, learned things the hard way, and I’ve managed to keep it alive longer than a lot of people told me it would last. I even have some money saved up from myprize, which still feels strange to say because for a long time everything went straight back into the business.  \nWhat I wasn’t prepared for is how isolating the decision making can feel.  \nEvery choice feels like it matters more than it probably does. Pricing, hiring help, saying no to a client, saying yes to the wrong one. There’s no manager to sanity check things, no team meeting where someone else shares the weight. It’s just me, my laptop, and a constant background question of am I doing this right.\n\nI’ll go back and forth for days over things that look small from the outside. Spend a little to save time or save the money and burn myself out. Play it safe or take a risk. Protect the cash I worked hard to build or reinvest and hope it pays off. Either way, if it goes wrong, it’s on me.\n\nWhat makes it harder is that people assume owning a business means freedom and confidence. So I don’t really talk about the doubt part. I nod along, say things are good, and keep the stress to myself. I don’t regret starting this at all. I just didn’t realize how much of the job is sitting quietly with uncertainty and still having to move forward.\n\nI guess I’m curious how other small business owners deal with that. Does the constant second guessing ever calm down, or do you just get better at carrying it without letting it take over everything.",

You are still getting your paycheck each Friday regardless.

And that’s ok.\n\nI’m a spiritual guy as well, so people can take this part with a pinch of salt, but it’s also important to know that the big guy is always looking out for you. If it doesn’t make sense, it’s because the movie isn’t at the end yet!",

I just kind of like variety and don't like to do the same thing all the time. \n\nPart of the reason I want to be self-employed is I don't want anybody else to have any input on decisions.. \nI'll totally admit it.\nI want to sink or swim and on my own accord.\nNow there have been times where I have consulted a family member or friends about decisions I might be making but that's just for discussion or to work through things because I want to be the only one that has not just the final say but the only say.\n\nI don't really have any problem making decisions. \nI also find it's not really that important and I tend to just go where life takes me. \nThen, if I want to do something I just figured I should go ahead and do it. \n\nI guess a lot of this has to do with it what type of work you actually do in your business and you didn't give us much info on that. \n\nI have seen some memes floating around and seen at least a couple but mainly one person who repeatedly post about how hard it is to be a small business owner. Lol\nThey talk about how you never had any free time and how you're always on call and all of this stuff. \nI think they're nuts!!\n\nThis is more than likely true for a lot of young people just getting into business but that's because they're too fresh at it too hungry/greedy is what I call them.\n\nOnce you've been doing it for a while or 3 decades plus like I have, you just get your day in or do what little dab you have to to meet your deadline or make the money you need to make for the day, week, month etc and that's good enough. \nAt least it always has been for me. \n\nUsually about every year or so I will get motivated and want to buy something. \nSometimes these things are fairly expensive and I never actually need them. \nSo I get motivated and I hustle and do a bunch of extra work so I can go spend it. \n\nI  have plenty of savings too and I make it a point to increase that savings a minimum amount each and every year. \n\n\nSometimes it's just time management. Use the settings on your electronic devices or whatever to have your phone or emails etc only work during hours that you're open. \nSend them to an automated message before and after these times. \nFor the past two days I have had customers calling me at 7:30 a.m., 7:52 a.m., 8:12 a.m. and 8:32 a.m. when I don't open until 9:00. \nSome of them left a message but it really doesn't matter because none of them will get an answer before I'm open and most of them probably won't get a call back even if they left a message.\n\nIf you're not smart enough or  considerate enough to see the hours when you find the listing before you hit the clip to call button then I don't think I want you as a customer. \n\nI blame Google a lot for this. They have put the send a text tab on multiple listings when I never authorized it and I don't want it there because I'm not going to conduct business via text messaging.\nThey also will show you on maps if you're navigating there when you click on it that the business is not open yet or may not be still open when you get there if it's close to closing but they don't bother to show this when someone clicks to call. \nThere should at least be an extra prompt saying this business is currently closed would you still like to call? \n\nThe biggest thing that's negative about running your own business is what people have always said about the worst thing with dealing with the public IS dealing with the public.\nIt's also the main reason a lot of people stop running businesses and not because it's hard or timing or anything else.",

      "selftext": "I am a small business owner in Southern California and I am targeted by a predatory litigation mill. Looking for advice from anyone who has successfully fought back or been through similar situation\n\nBackground\n\nFirst Lawsuit  \nWe were sued by a predatory firm a few years ago. We settled, paid the fees, and hired a professional ADA company to fix every single item they identified. We have not changed the code or the site since that remediation was completed\n\nNew Claim  \nSame law firm is suing us again, but using a different \"plaintiff\"  \nPlaintiff's name shows up as a serial filer\n\nThe \"Service\"  \nThey didn't even serve me (yet?) An advertising firm emailed the complaint (no case number) to my boyfriend’s personal email address\n\nSite  \nOur website should be good. It scores 100 on Google Lighthouse and 0 Issues on axe DevTools. I even have a letter from a blind customer stating the site works perfectly for her\n\nWe are hanging by a thread. We’ve closed most of our locations and are sitting on $500k in EIDL debt from COVID. We literally have no cash to settle again\n\nOur lawyer is suggesting we just settle again to make it go away, but we don't have the money. I’ve told him we are \"judgment proof\" since the EIDL loan essentially means the government has first rights to our assets and we have no profit to take\n\nQuestions for the community\n\n1. Has anyone successfully used a prior settlement/remediation to get a second suit from the same firm thrown out?\n2. Since the EIDL loan is so high and the business is failing, has anyone successfully argued \"judgment proof\" to get these guys to stop wasting their time?\n\nI’m exhausted. It feels like it doesn't matter if your site is up to code, they just keep coming back. Any advice is appreciated\n\nFor all small business owners out there that have been through this and more, my heart goes out to you!",

That sounds really stressful and frustrating.\n\nI'm not a lawyer, but this is how I would approach it if it were me:\n\nFirst, I’d step back and look at who’s actually benefiting. The law firm makes money when I settle. If I keep paying, I’m making it easy for them to keep suing. That’s not solving my problem, it’s solving theirs.\n\nThen I’d try to break the pattern. If they expect me to settle quickly, I’d do the opposite. I’d ask questions, push back, and make it more work for them. The goal is to stop being an easy target.\n\nI’d also try to buy time. I’d check if the lawsuit was served properly, ask what exactly I’m being accused of, and point out if I already fixed the issue. Slowing things down gives me more control.\n\nI’d do some of my own research too. Just a quick Google search helped me find Rule 11, which looks like something that can be used in California to push back if the lawsuit is being filed just to pressure settlements without real investigation.\n\nAnd if my lawyer seems more focused on settling than protecting me, I’d consider finding someone else. It’s okay to question advice if it doesn’t feel right for you.\n\nI know this is exhausting, especially if you’re already in debt and juggling too many problems. But if pushing back now helps stop it from happening again, it might be worth the effort for you.",

Hopefully they have a good professional policy, employee HR issues tend to have extraordinarily high deductibles.  It’s part of how the insurance company really tries to encourage you to do the compliance trainings… ours is $35k.  Which means I have a very strong incentive to do compliance training and mediate before issues arise to this level.  Since an attorney is involved, you need to notify your insurance.  Depending on your policy, they may cover the legal defense.  Based on what you have stated so far though.. I suspect they are going to offer to cut a check to settle.  Your defense in situations such as this are your history of compliance trainings and history of responses, after issues were arose.  Without having done compliance training and an admission of that statement, at a minimum, they’re going to get a pay day.  The goal is to mitigate that, not eliminate it now.",

We had a written warning meeting which was met with a lot of defensiveness from the employee.\n\nFor context - it’s a hair salon.\n\nToday I asked them if they were going to finish their client in time or if they’d be running behind. They assured me they’d be finished on time.\n\nThey were a full half hour late for their next client. And charged the first client (who they spent 7 hours with) incorrectly.\n\nI had my manager meet me at work and we met with the stylist and let them go.\n\nThey acted surprised - but we reminded them of every meeting we had leading up to it. Frankly, I was very sad to have to let them go. but it’s not sustainable.\n\nThe morale has already been low and I know this will be a big blow. It’s a small team and several of them are very good friends with the person who was fired.\n\nI’m not sure how to show up for the team to let the know this really shouldn’t have been a surprise for the person who got fired. I know I have to be vague.\n\nI don’t want anyone to be worried about their job.\n\nAny tips for getting morale up and making sure the team still trusts us?\n\nTypically the staff would be brought down by an employee who wasn’t pulling their weight but in this case - the time issue really only impacted their clients, the front desk team, and the bottom line.

I was a hairstylist for over a decade with Inattentive ADD. I wasn't diagnosed until much later in life. I wasn't aware of my time blindness and lack of time management while I was in the industry. In the beginning, I struggled to complete services within a set time. Eventually, with time and experience I learned how to complete the service in the allotted time. I'm so thankful that the salon owners I was working for worked with my schedule providing the time I needed (one owner definitely had ADHD). I'm bringing this up to bring to your attention that many people in the industry have this condition. Having some understanding of their shortcomings along with some compassion, and giving them the means to be successful will go a long way with these employees.

          "body": "That’s one of the hardest versions of letting someone go, especially when they’re genuinely likeable and not malicious. It messes with your head because emotionally it feels like a betrayal even when rationally you know it wasn’t sustainable. Being surprised is also pretty common. People often hear the conversations but don’t really internalize that the line is getting closer.\n\nIn a small team like that, I’ve found that trust usually comes more from how consistent you are afterward than from how perfectly you explain the decision. You don’t have to convince them the firing was justified, just show that expectations are clear and applied the same way to everyone. I’ve noticed morale dips more when leadership seems uneasy or apologetic than when they’re calm and grounded about a tough call.\n\nI started privately noting situations like this because over time you realize patterns around performance issues versus personality and it helps you show up steadier the next time. Curious whether your team has been reacting more with worry or more with sadness, those usually need very different responses.",

And it worked out great, given the crazy shortage of capacity amid the growth of the LLM sector.   \n  \nBUT these taxes in Europe are *killing* me. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to start working for nothing just because I have to strictly follow corporate tax compliance, because I'm a decent person and I don't like prisons, haha. \n\nHeard that VAT can be partially refunded or not paid at all, and even looked for some local sales tax advisory services (I'm in Turkey), but so far it all looks too complicated and hopeless. I'm not even thinking about VAT exemption - it's too cool to be true. But hope dies last, so I want to ask you - has anyone dealt with this crap?   \n  \nAll this time, I've been sending servers all over Europe to minimize ping for my clients, and my wallet can no longer withstand these taxes.   \n  \nWould be VERY grateful for your help.",

      "selftext": "So I hired a person in July 2025. She is fresh out of college and kept emailing repeatedly for a job. I thought she would be a go-getter. She started off great (everyone is a rockstar the first couple weeks, right?). A few months in, I noticed the door to my suite opening like clock work around the half hour mark when she would take a 15-20 minute restroom break (every hour). This has irritated me a great deal and evidently she read my irritation and started opening and closing the door very softly so I could not hear it. This irritated me even more. She continues to use the bathroom probably 1.5 to 2.0 hours per work day. Today, I walked into her office and she had her feet propped up on a second chair and was sitting far away from her monitors. As soon as I said something she sprung up (evidently she was \"resting her eyes\"). What should I do here? I need the help but she is starting to slip? How do I document here file if I want to terminate here without paying her unemployment?",

Half the descriptions are cryptic like \"SQ pending transaction\" or \"AMZN marketplace\" with no other context.  \n  \nI have a separate business card but I still use my personal card sometimes when I forget to bring the business one, then I have to manually flag those transactions in a spreadsheet except I never remember to actually do it. My accountant charges by the hour and we just burned through 200 bucks of billing time playing detective with my own spending habits.  \n  \nNext year I'm going to be better about tracking this stuff in real time, that's what I said last year too, somehow January rolls around and I'm in the exact same mess. How do people actually stay organized with business expenses without it being a full time job?",

I do a great job, deliver before their deadline, I give them discounts and freebies all the time.\n\nLast week they asked for a quote. We had done the same merchandise last year, kept the same pricing, offered free delivery. They came back and asked if I could do the job at almost half of what I quoted. I said I couldn’t do it at that price but I would offer an additional discount. Then they ghosted me.\n\nWhat in the world am I supposed to do? They always try to beat me down in price. While I understand the need to shop things around, it’s frustrating to be against a wall.\n\nAny advice?\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThank you to everyone for your input and advice. This has been a tough time and a very tough lesson for me. But I have learned so much from the advice I have been given on this post. Without giving too much info, here is why this is so upsetting.\n\n1. The company in question is huge. They have been my customer for over 15 years. If they have last minute requests, I get it done and my work is quality work that has been showcased on a national level.\n2. A few months ago they asked for me to donate an expensive item. I said I was unable to donate but I offered a big discount. I was told that I would lose the account unless I donated the item. I was told I would have the exclusive to the account if I made the donation. I gave in. And this is why this new job being given to another vendor is so upsetting. I feel like I was blackmailed and I gave in. But it didn’t make a difference.",

One was from a small project company that only worked with subcontractors and had only been around for two or three years. The other was from a long-established construction company.\n\nSo she played the two companies off against each other.\n\nShe told the second company the first company's quoted price to try and drive the price down.  \nThen she told the first company the second company's new quote, and the second company lowered its price again.  \nShe repeated this several times until the price had dropped drastically.  \nI warned her! There's a limit! Everything has its price. If you push it too far, the company will end up cutting corners on quality, etc.\n\nAs expected, the second construction company stopped the price negotiations, saying: \"We can't reduce the price any further without compromising on quality, and we won't do that. After all, we have to protect our reputation.\" If tyou still want it cheaper, good luck.\n\nThe project company, on the other hand, drastically reduced the price again.  \nShe asked me for advice:\n\nI replied:  \n1. Price shouldn't be the deciding factor!  \n2. The second company was honest and reputable.  \n3. The project company will undercut every price, and then pass this price pressure on to their subcontractors. It's predictable that this will lead to problems.\n\nTake the offer from the, in my opinion, reputable local construction company.\n\nBut she decided otherwise. After the project company threw in a free open fireplace, which was originally supposed to cost €16,000, she chose that company.  \nLuckily, I was able to persuade her to agree to 30 installments, essentially one payment per week. This keeps the risk of loss low.\n\nIt happened as probably everyone expected:  \nDuring the shell construction phase, she paid another installment of €12,000 on Friday.  \nOn Monday, the various subcontractors arrived at the construction site, loaded materials and tools, and were about to leave.They hadn't been paid for two weeks.  \nThe project company had filed for bankruptcy!\n\nOnly then did she begin researching the company and find other affected homeowners. Among other things, the managing director had already filed for bankruptcy three times and then started over under a new name.\n\nNow she was stuck with a half-finished shell of a house. Fortunately, her loss amounted to \"only\" €12,000, which she claimed in court.  \nAfterward, she had to negotiate directly with all the subcontractors and pay them so that the work could be completed. Friends and relatives also had to step in to keep the losses to a minimum.\n\nAs a result, the completion of the house was delayed by almost 12 months! She couldn't afford the exterior plastering for another two years. The final price increased by approximately 45% compared to the original quote. And all of this certainly caused her several sleepless nights.  \nShe would have been better off building with the construction company that wouldn't be blackmailed.\n\nAs a reputable company, you have to be able to say \"NO!\"  \nThe simplest way:  \nYou want us to reduce the price even further?  \nOkay, suggest where we should cut corners on quality!  \nYou're the business owner! You also have a responsibility. Your company, your prices.  \nSo  your prices should be well-calculated.  \nAnd \"well-calculated\" in this case means there's a Price floor you can't go below.",

          "body": "Enforcing price changes with current and loyal customers is always a challenge. \n\nWhat I've found from working on the financial and sales side of corporate is that you can avoid most of the pain by being very communicative, and keeping up good followup service after the sale. \n\nThe fear is always the same and it's understandable: \"If I raise my prices/don't kowtow to pressure, they'll just go to my competitor.\"\n\nMaybe. Maybe not. \n\nWhat I recommend everyone does, regardless up if you have an upcoming price change, or renegotiation or not:\n\n- Always keep in contact with your customers. Regular newsletters are great. Keep them informed with what you're doing and ideally \"here are new ways we can serve you.\" Make them simple, short, readable, informative. \n- Ask for the price increase before they ask for your discount. \"Due to recent tariffs, import costs, commodities price increase, etc...we unfortunately have had to increase prices. We've worked hard to keep all other costs the same and have even implemented ways to keep them down, however, we are still unable to provide the current pricing.\" (or something like that). \n- Discounts are up to you, but if you can manage it, consider offering holding the current pricing and tacking on an additional service...or if you're contract based, request longer terms for a discount, or if it benefits your cash situation, discount them if they pay ahead all at once (if your business model works this way). \n\nAlways train others how you want them to treat you. This is true for personal interactions as it is for business. If you give up 20% one year, they're going to hope to get it again in year 2; If you do it in year 2, they're going to expect it every year. \n\nBut most of all - always work in the best interest of your company, not your customer. If your company dies, you don't get that customer anyway. \n\n***\n\nStory time:\n\nGo back to like 30 years ago. I was only a kid then but, my current day job company made the fatal mistake of having about 40% of its business and capacity sunk into one national customer. We only provided one product to this customers and it was good. \n\nThis customer, when it came up to renegotiate, put the business up for bid and a competitor came in and put their hat in the ring. \n\nAt the time, we were like a $50M business, probably less. This competitor was a $1B business. \n\nThe customer, who's name rhymes with \"Ball Fart\", as you might expect began to put us in the vise. \n\nThe competitor, a well-diversified company came in with a price that we knew made the product a loss leader for them. The strategy was to work with that customer to get distribution for other products in the portfolio. \n\nWe were not diversified. We were/are very efficient at making this product, but we couldn't hit that price. Ball Fart gave us a final target. If we hit it we would no longer need to compete and they'd close the bid.\n\nIt was very low. We had until the next monday at 10am to tell them our decision.\n\nOn that Friday, our head of Finance and Accounting, who was like a 30 year old, was tasked to spend the weekend and project the scenarios so we knew how to proceed. He built the P&amp;Ls and the full business case for each. \n\nEven though this would chew up a ton of overhead and give us room to play around with price elsewhere, ultimately, this customer, who was 40% of our business, would devastate our P&amp;L. The operating expenses dwarfed revenues and we couldn't shift cost or price enough anywhere to make up for it. \n\nSo that Monday. 10AM. President gets on the phone with the head of accounting and the buyer at Ball Fart with the decision. \n\nHe muted the buyer and asked for that final confirmation: \"Are you sure that this is the right move? No turning back.\" Accounting head confirmed it. \n\n\"Hey Ball Fart Buyer. We can't hit your price. Our final price is $X.XX\"\n\nWe lost the business. We now had 50% vacant capacity, roughly 40% less revenue, and a whole lot of overhead to suddenly chew up. We couldn't distribute it to the other customers. \n\nWe had to let go a ton of people. We had to board up a part of the plant because it was too expensive to run/inspect for nothing. We had to revisit how we acquire customers because we simply didn't have enough. \n\nBut the alternative was worse: the company would have folded. Because we were foolish enough to keep Ball Fart around at 40% of our business - we couldn't afford to use them as a loss leader. \n\nToday - we learned lots of lessons and our biggest customer is something like 5% of our business. Most of all, however, we knew that as painful as it might be, kowtowing to a painful price request would have given us another 6-12 months before we were done.",

I put about $250,000 into the site to improve it.\n\nThis site was the first car wash in my city maybe 35 years ago, since then this site has failed 3-4 times that I know of. When I bought it, this wash was 1 of 3 and now I'm 1 of 9 with the 6 new washes being huge private equity run large brands with hundreds of locations.  Probably $5-8million dollar beautiful locations\n\nThe site never profited. At best it broke even. Now with all the new competition I'm losing about $7700 a month.\n\nPart of me is reluctant to close it down because I still have this hope that it could be successful to some degree.\n\nOther side of me is I'm tired of dealing with employees, customer issues, legal, and accounting work., Always the possibility of liability from a customer or even an employee.   I'm also at a point in my life where I'm able to retire.  My possibilities are 1. Attempt to sell the wash as a complete car wash 2. Sell off the assets and sell building.  3.  Lease the vacant building in land.\n\nAbout $100,000 of the equipment I could use at another location. I was considering listing the complete wash for 750,000 and see where it goes. After that I would probably lease just the building and land for maybe 3000 a month.\n\n  \nThank you for any time and advice you can share",

          "body": "\nWelcome to business ownership lol! My views have changed drastically on everything and not just politically. I refuse to get sucked into the weeds though. If you want to be different, you can’t operate how everyone else does. Here is what I have done and it has helped tremendously. \n\n1) Be slow to hire and quick to fire. Set the tone and expectations up front and don’t deviate. Remember, one bad employee can ruin the culture  and atmosphere. You have to cut out the cancer before it kills the body. \n\n2) Maintain boundaries. We can be friends/family after work. During work, there has to be an owner/employee professional decorum. \n\n3) Everything is transparent. From individual employee salaries to business operating expenses.   Everything is on a tv in the break room and is updated in real time. \n\n4) Employees are paid their respective rate. However, there are several ways they can earn additional commissions. There is also an account that they can earn biannual bonuses from. Everything is posted in real time and allows the employees to have a vested interest in how the company performs. If the company does well, everyone does well. \n\n5) Having systems will change the way you operate. The business will thrive or fail based on the systems you implement. Also don’t be afraid to revise or add systems as needed. However, you must be consistent once they are implemented. \n\nSelf employment isn’t for the faint of heart. Once you get a taste for it, you’ll never be able to work for someone else again. At the end of the day, you are your own worst enemy. You got this!",

I worked as an Ops manager at my last job. We paid about 30% higher on wages, didn't have mandatory overtime, our turnover was maybe 1 employee every 2-3 years (typical for our industry is 6 months). We had a crew that would bend over backwards for us, but that's because they knew leadership would do the same, because we had in the past.\n\nDid we have some bad hires? 100% but we didn't ever think everyone was out to get us, we just learned from it and applied new guard rails going forward to avoid that type of hire again.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nI'm in the early stages of launching a small product-based side hustle mostly simple, everyday home goods and accessories that people actually use, think kitchen organizers, travel gadgets, that kind of thing. After researching suppliers, it quickly became obvious that China is where almost all of this stuff gets made affordably. But as a complete beginner with no prior import experience, I'm trying to avoid the classic pitfalls of sketchy suppliers, poor quality, massive shipping delays, unexpected tariffs, or getting stuck with unusable inventory.\n\n\nI've spent the last few weeks poking around the main platforms. Alibaba is the go-to for most people I see online, but it feels overwhelming with all the trading companies mixed in with factories. 1688 (through agents) seems cheaper for direct-from-manufacturer but has a language barrier. Global Sources looks more premium/B2B-focused. I also came across Made-in-China, which appears geared toward verified factories with detailed supplier profiles and some emphasis on quality checks—though I know sites can hype themselves up.\n\n\nI'm not married to any one platform; I just want to do this right the first time and not waste money on bad orders. Fellow small business owners who've successfully imported from China:\n\nWhat platforms or sites have actually worked best for you in practice (pros, cons, or why you switched)?\nHave you had good/bad experiences with Made-in-China.com specifically, or is it similar to the others?\nWhat are your biggest red flags when evaluating suppliers (e.g., fake reviews, MOQ issues, communication)?\nPractical tips for newbies: Do you always order samples first? Use sourcing agents? Preferred payment methods (PayPal vs. bank transfer vs. Trade Assurance)? How are you handling current tariffs/customs without getting hit too hard?\nAny must-do steps or resources (books, YouTube channels, forums) that helped you get started without major headaches?\n\nReally value any firsthand stories what went wrong, what you'd do differently, or what surprised you positively. Thanks so much in advance for sharing your wisdom, it's helping a ton as I figure this out!",

In the beginning you do everything but as time goes by, you delegate more and more to other roles. It's main goal is to move you from \"working in your business\" to \"working on your business\". Typically I would want to hire people that have skills I don't have perhaps ( finance, marketing, sales, production, etc..) but in the very early stages you're probably looking for anyone to just lighten the load so you can focus on business strategy and other things. People want to be led. They want to know what they are going to do everyday so spend time being very clear about this. Do not leave it up to them to manage their own time. This is different than micro-managing (which isn't a bad thing depending how you handle that). If you need help with organizing yourself, you can describe all your goals for this employee, the job duties, the culture vibe, etc... with Chat-GPT and it will do a pretty good job of building you a playbook for them. I have two main rules when onboarding employees: Don't lie and be reliable. I have many others, but these are my cardinal rules I let them know day one. You need to trust them. Being a great leader is a never ending pursuit. It takes years and you'll always be working on it. Be patient with yourself.",

Or, what if an employee that has been with me for years isn't working near as hard as a new hire, but are earning more money?  Fair can get tricky in a small business - and that's just employees.
