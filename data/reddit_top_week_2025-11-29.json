      "selftext": " Right now I mainly rely on a few small income streams from home.\n\nOne part is paid surveys and small online tasks. I try to join better paid survey panels and treat the rest as pocket money, the key is to do them regularly. Sometimes I also use sites like Clickworker to take small tasks, usually around five to six dollars each.\n\nAnother part is Fiverr. I take orders there for website and app testing and give user feedback. This does need some basic skills and you also have to spend time building your profile and reviews, so the beginning is slow.\n\nI also do some niche reselling. I look for small rare items that some people still want, like merch from certain communities or old devices that are no longer made. I buy them cheap, clean them up and resell them. This part depends a lot on information gaps.\n\nThe newest part is using AI to make commercial videos for clients. I write a full script at home first, then use the commercial video templates in MovieFlow to create an AI version of the video. After that I bring it into an editor to fix the pacing, visuals and subtitles, then send the final video to the client for their website or social media. The pay for this is usually higher than normal small tasks.\n\nAll of these can be done from home and do not need a huge upfront cost. I am curious what legal at home side hustles are the most stable or most worth recommending for you. Is there anything you feel a normal person could start without a big risk or huge budget",

      "selftext": " This month I picked up a small side gig making short videos for a kids story series. A tiny publisher wanted simple storybook style clips for socials and their site, two to three minutes each, calm pacing and very soft visuals,so we agreed to base everything on their “Kids Storybook” template inside MovieFlow. We agreed on 75 dollars per episode, they ordered 12, so I cleared about 900 dollars on top of my main job.\n\nThe pipeline is simple enough. They send me the story text and age range. I clean it up into a read aloud script, drop it into MF to get a first long storybook style cut, then do small tweaks in a regular editor like CapCut or Resolve Free intro, outro, timing fixes, light audio cleanup. Now that I have a rhythm each episode takes around 30 mins to 45 mins end to end.\n\nFor me this works because it is fully remote, the visual expectations are reasonable, and the heavy lifting of turning a full script into a watchable sequence sits on the tools instead of me hand building every frame in a timeline. Right now I am just treating it as a clean little sidehustle that fits into evenings without wrecking the rest of my week.",

Lots of people don’t want to use the self cleaning option (you should include them in your listing as an FYI). \n\nI’d really focus on the “pre-holiday” aspect and try to advertise other service that go along with it. Like deep freezer cleaning, those things can be a nightmare to clean if you are short 🤦🏼‍♀️\n\nIf you’re good at setting up Christmas trees, I’d pay to have that done 😂 especially if you were going to vacuum up the mess after it was in place.",

I tried doing this with headlight restoration, but the issue is that all the cars with foggy headlights are street Parked and I'd have no idea how to contact the owner to get it restored. And most cars parked in the driveway had the cleanest headlights I've ever seen. And truthfully, my results have always been a bit of a mixed bag.\n\nSo I'm looking for another side hustle I can do where customer acquisition is very easy. I don't mind if a service is cheap like $10-30 per service if there are plentiful customers. I wanna know that if I go door to door almost everyone is a potential customer. I wanna be able to start tomorrow and have made back the investment by the end of the day almost guaranteed.\n\nLastly, I only have $50-$100 to invest in this. So anything I can start in that range would be perfect.",

Go door to door to popular restaurants, barber shops, sports complexes, ice cream shops- anywhere there’s a wait time with kids.  All you need to find is one square foot.  Then go to CandyMachines dot com.  Buy a mini claw machine with a credit card reader.  We will ship the machine directly to your house within a few days.  Add rubber ducks or small toys. Each machine should earn you several hundred dollars a month.  If it doesn’t, relocate the machine to another business where it does.  Check your local business and gaming requirements. Typically each machine requires a registration sticker.  \n\nThe best part is that CandyMachines will setup and configure the machine completely for you.  And they have a huge YouTube channel showing all the details you need to know to operate the machines.",

I want something that can slowly build stable cash flow, not something where I need to stare at charts every day and stress about it.\n\nRight now I am looking at a few ideas like small niche ecommerce, simple info products, and basic service sites, for example online booking or menu pages for local shops. My tech skills are okay but I am not an expert, so I am thinking of using a chat based website builder to launch a first version, then polish later. For example, with something like Genstore I could talk to it and let it help me set up a few landing pages for small projects, see which one gets clicks or messages, and then decide what to focus on.\n\nIf you had around eight thousand dollars, only wanted to do online projects, and the goal was steady cash flow with models that are already somewhat tested, which direction would you choose Would you spend more on traffic first, or build a few small sites to test ideas and then double down on the ones that work I would love to hear what worked for you and what to avoid.",

I get the $100 plus the monthly dividend from fidelity. The risk is you are buying a stock that could potentially go down in value and you may lose money.

You will have more time off than other professions and if you have children in school your vacation time will most likely mirror their vacation time. In addition, the retirement is not too bad. Many will disagree with me. I have known several people who have done nothing but hop from one job to the next for the last 30 years. I have no clue how they think they will receive a retirement. They have no pensions and have only paid into Social Security sporatically. One of my friends from high school actually had a certificate in sterlizing tools for medical procedures. I understand that the pay was decent. Unfortunately, she hopped out that job and started work for a convenience store. I think her retirement will include working in order to afford to put food on her table. I knew several people who have done the same thing as she did. It was as if it was a disease. \n\nAs far as going back to school. I knew some people in college who were older than me. No one thinks less of them. I never did. As long as you are serious about your goal it is possible. There is nothing wrong with it. You must put your mind into it and go the long haul to the finish line to get your degree, certificate, or whatever your goal is. Whatever the field is try to talk to someone who is in that field so you can get more information about and possibly how that job will do in the future.  As far as a new trade- if I were you I would make sure that I was compatible with that trade. Good luck.",

If better pics could help them catch even *some* of those lost customers, maybe they'd pay for that.\n\nBefore you call it a “shitty idea,” remember this: restaurant owners who’ve run their business for years don’t buy anything that would mislead their customers. They bought because the quality matched what they actually serve.\n\nMy goal wasn’t to make cheap-looking AI pics. I recreated the dish exactly how it’s served, just styled and lit properly, like it would be in a pro studio shoot.\n\nSo I made a list of places with awful-looking menus.  \nThen I used ChatGPT’s image tool to generate nicer versions—pro-style, appetizing, clean backgrounds. No camera. No food. Just AI prompts.\n\nI emailed each business with two free sample images based on their menu.  \nSuper simple message. No pitch. Just:  \n“Hey, I tried reimagining your dishes like this.”\n\nSome ignored it.  \nSome replied.  \nAnd a few asked for a full set of menu pics.\n\nI wasn’t charging much - around €150 per client, but after a while I was making around €1K/month, just working with businesses in my area.\n\nZero experience. No portfolio. Just an idea, free tools, and a bit of time.\n\nIf you’re broke or starting from scratch, this might be worth trying. It’s super easy to do and doesn’t take much time at all.",

Way easier to sell - Restaurant owners trust it more (no fake food concerns)\n2. No customer backlash - Customers get exactly what they see, just styled better\n3. Fully automated - No spending hours on ChatGPT prompts per restaurant\n\nFor anyone wanting to replicate OP's success: The opportunity is 100% real.

If you dont take the effort to even try to show me what you are selling I can't trust you with my food.\nBesides, this is highly unethical. You are deciving people into thinking the food they order is what they see and its not. And also, the way you worded it, it seems like the business dont know you are using AI. People dont pay only for a result, but for the process and work too. Perhaps they don't know that they can do that for free without almost any work or just paying the work of an editor, and they are paying you what they consider the price for a full photo set.",

      "selftext": "I work in property management and got really tired of using the same clunky templates my company provided. Started making my own google sheets for tenant tracking, maintenance schedules, all that boring stuff. Made them way more automated with formulas and conditional formatting.\n\nMy coworker saw them and asked if she could buy one off me. I was like sure, 15 bucks whatever. Then she told her friend who manages a small apartment complex, and that person bought too.\n\nThat got me thinking so I cleaned them up, made them more universal, and listed them on etsy back in june. Didn't expect much honestly since its such a specific thing. But property managers and small landlords kept finding them. I guess there's not a ton of options out there that aren't either too basic or overly complicated.\n\nNow I'm averaging like $400 a month from it. Some months are $300, had one month hit almost $600. I spend maybe an hour a week answering questions or doing small updates when someone requests a feature. The money just hits my account and its pretty nice.\n\nI've got some money saved up from Stаke now and I genuinely don't know how to scale this thing. Like do I hire someone to make more templates? Start advertising? Expand to other platforms? I'm kinda stuck because this whole thing happened by accident and I dont really have a business background. I'm not even good at marketing. I just wrote decent descriptions, used the right keywords, and let etsy do its thing. Thinking about making templates for other industries now but haven't decided which one yet.",

Rent is $1100.\n\nTried applying to other retail jobs but everything was part time or minimum wage. Decided to figure out how to make money online instead.\n\nStarted an Instagram page about budget meal prep in May. Thought it would be easy. Posted random recipes and tips. Got maybe 30 likes per post. Grew to 800 followers in 2 months and made $0.\n\nTried to monetize too early. Put affiliate links everywhere. Nobody clicked. Page looked desperate.\n\nStopped posting for 3 weeks in July because I thought it was pointless. Then randomly posted a video about making meals for under $3. It got 35k views. Went from 800 followers to 4200 in a week.\n\nStarted posting more consistently after that. Had a few more videos hit 10k to 20k views over the next couple months. Growth slowed down but kept going.\n\nBrands started reaching out in August. First deal was $150 for 3 posts about meal planning containers. Thought it was a scam but they paid.\n\nMade $340 in September from brand deals and Amazon affiliate links. Made $680 in October. Made $900 in November.\n\nAlso started doing social media management for local businesses in September. Found my first client by DMing a coffee shop that had 400 followers and hadn't posted in 2 months. Offered to run their Instagram for $200/month.\n\nGot a second client in October, a nail salon for $250/month. Then a third one in November, a small gym for $200/month. That's $650/month from freelance work.\n\nTotal in November was $1550. First time I've covered rent and groceries without panicking.\n\nInstagram page is at 9k followers now. I try to post daily but realistically it's more like 4-5 times a week. Mostly short videos about cheap meals and grocery shopping tips.\n\nSocial media work takes about 6 hours a week total. Create posts for all 3 clients, schedule them, reply to comments. Pretty easy once you have a system.\n\nStill not stable though. Instagram income varies a lot. Some months brands reach out, some months nothing. Freelance clients could drop me anytime.\n\nBut it's better than retail. At least I control my time.\n\nTime investment is maybe 15-20 hours a week across everything. Costs are around $35/month for scheduling tools and some other stuff. Recently started using APOB at $14/month for profile content.\n\nBiggest thing I learned is you can't force it. That one video that blew up wasn't better than my other content. Just got lucky with timing. Now I post consistently and hope something hits.\n\nHow do you guys find brands to work with besides just waiting around?",

I was convinced that if I made something “good enough,” people would start buying.\n\nReality check: I earned nothing.\n\nEach time I launched a new product, I told myself, *“This one will be the one.”*  \nBut I never stopped to ask the only question that mattered:\n\n**Does anyone actually want this?**\n\nI wasn’t testing demand.  \nI wasn’t building an audience.  \nI wasn’t validating my ideas.\n\nI was just creating and hoping — the quickest way to burn time and energy.\n\n**The hard truth I finally accepted**\n\nPeople don’t care about your product unless it solves a problem they already feel.  \nYou can spend weeks crafting something amazing…  \n…but if no one asked for it, they won’t buy it.\n\n  \n**So here’s what I’m doing now (and what I wish I’d done from the start):**\n\n1. Create a simple, mini version first.\n2. Offer it for free to measure interest.\n3. Capture emails from everyone who downloads it.\n4. Build the full product *only* if there’s real, proven demand.\n\nThis is the first time I’m actually following this process — and honestly, it feels like a total game-changer.\n\n  \n**Your Turn:**\n\nIf you’ve built digital products or tried launching side hustles:  \n**What was your biggest early mistake?**  \nI’d love to know I’m not the only one who had to learn this lesson the hard way.\n\n# ",

          "body": "I've been making a couple hundred each month just by looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than the cost. It's called bonus arbitrage. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

      "selftext": "Lately I have been reading this sub a lot and watching people around me. A few people I know say they make around 20k a month using AI to create influencer style photos and short videos. It is not just posting random AI art any more. They build a full AI influencer brand around one character and keep a steady flow of posts across platforms.\n\nWhat I see now is that AI is turning into a way to produce content at scale. For images people keep talking about tools like Modelsify, Midjourney and Lumalabs to lock in the look and style. For video some people write a real script first, then use something like MovieFlow to turn that script into a longer story video, and later cut it into vertical shorts for each platform. It feels more like a small content studio than a one off AI experiment.\n\nI am still just watching and learning, nowhere near that income level, but the demand seems real. As a viewer you are following a character and an ongoing story, not just random posts. As a creator, once the character and accounts are set up, the work is more about keeping a pace and posting rhythm, which starts to look a bit like semi passive income. I am not greedy. If I could make an extra 200 dollars a month from something like this I would already be happy.\n\nSo I wanted to ask people here who are actually doing this. When you use AI for content as a side project, how do you build the image pipeline and keep the video look stable over time Are there tool combinations you trust for long term work For example where do you still rely on classic editing and where do you let a long form AI video tool like MovieFlow handle the first version And in real life, how passive does it feel once the system is running",

You should listen to it so you can learn about the pitfalls of others, they definitely have a range of unfair splits and spending problems that you can probably find every situation you could possibly face with your flaws and your partner's flaws covered.

I just feel that if I could make an extra 1–2k a month, life would feel a lot less tight. The problem is when I search online, everything is “passive income guide” and it just makes me more confused.\n\nRecently I have been trying random ideas. Some people say start a faceless video channel. Some say write templates and sell them. Others say open a small online store and sell a few very niche products. Tools are also everywhere now. I can use Canva for visuals, chat tools for copy, and for the website part I could use something like genstore to spin up a basic store and then tweak the details myself. On paper it all sounds possible, but in reality I only have one or two hours a day and I am scared to pick the wrong thing.\n\nSo I wanted to ask people here with real experience. If you were in my position with a bit of starting money and limited time each day, what would you focus on first. Would you launch the simplest small site that can take payments and see if it brings in a little steady cash, or spend a long time building one skill until you can take on clients. Also curious which small projects looked good at first but turned out to be really bad for beginners.",

The only real consistent passive investment is stocks bonds and real estate (and real estate is very rarely passive unless you're incredibly rich). If you want more money a better use of your time would be: 1. Try find a partner, not only will you be happier but you'll double your salary immediately, two people working is essentially a must in this economy if you're poor. 2. Spend time upskilling, it's very rare that a passive investment will make you 12k a month without requiring lots of money to start it, but you can easily achieve a 12k increase in salary by upskilling (you can actually get much more than 12k increase in salary). So yes, those are my recommendations.",

Instead, focus entirely on mastering one single, high-demand skill like local Google Business Profile optimization or high-converting short-form ad copy which you can immediately exchange for predictable revenue from 3-4 small clients. The critical step is that once you land those clients, you must strategically delegate all the tedious administrative overhead like scheduling and invoicing to specialized support, ensuring your precious time is spent only on delivering the high-value, paid skill.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/is-the-wealthy-affiliate-black-friday-deal-worth-it-heres-whats-included-november-28-december-1/",

Don't be afraid to share with friends and family.\n\nAlso, AI gets a lot of bad rap, and I don't think AI is necessarily a full replacement of human ingenuity, but consulting an AI for ideas and feedback and using it for rapid iteration can be a very viable way to design digital products if you don't know where to start.\n\nBest of luck, and stay consistent my friend :)",

      "selftext": "I started building side projects a little over a year ago.\n\nSome of them got a few users, but they never made money. I kept running into the same issue: I was building without knowing if people actually wanted what I was making.\n\nMy latest project is different :)\n\nI launched [my project](https://bigideasdb.com/) 7 months ago, and it made $18,000 in revenue within that time. My most successful product by far.\n\nHere's what I did differently this time:\n\n**1. Building a habit of collecting problems**\n\nI created a habit of constantly writing down problems and pain points, whether it was something I personally experienced or something I saw others struggle with online.\n\nI use a simple notes system on my phone and just add problems whenever something clicks.\n\nWhen it came time to build a new project, I had dozens of validated problems to choose from. Most weren't great, but a few stood out. BigIdeasDB was one of them.\n\n**2. Validating before building anything**\n\nThis was the biggest difference-maker.\n\nInstead of immediately building the product, I spent time figuring out if it was something others would actually pay for.\n\nI shared the idea on Reddit and Twitter, reached out to founders, and asked questions like:\n\n* Do you struggle to find good product ideas?\n* Would you use a database of validated problems scraped from real sources like Reddit, G2, and Upwork?\n* How much would you pay for something like this?\n\nThe responses were overwhelmingly positive. That gave me the confidence to move forward.\n\n**3. Listening to users religiously**\n\nOnce I launched the MVP, I stayed close to my users. I asked them:\n\n* What's missing from the platform?\n* What would help you find better problems to solve?\n* What features would make you upgrade?\n\nThis approach made it so much easier to know what to build next. I didn't waste time guessing, I just built what users asked for.\n\n**4. Obsessing over metrics**\n\nI started tracking everything: website conversion rates, user activation behavior, and upgrade funnels.\n\nI could see exactly:\n\n* How many visitors converted to users\n* How many of those became paying customers\n* What actions made people more likely to convert\n\nFor example, my landing page was only converting at around 4% early on. I focused on improving that, and after testing different headlines and features, I got it to 9%, which directly doubled my revenue.\n\n**5. Focusing on real problems with buying intent**\n\nInstead of just collecting random complaints, I focused on problems where people were already spending money or actively looking for solutions.\n\nG2 reviews showed me what paying customers hated about existing tools. Upwork job listings revealed what companies were struggling to hire help for. Reddit posts highlighted frustrations people were venting about daily.\n\nThese weren't just problems, they were validated market opportunities.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nI had to fail multiple times before I figured out how to build something people actually wanted.\n\nThe biggest change this time was validating the idea early, but combining that with real user feedback, clear metrics, and focusing on problems with proven buying intent made everything easier.\n\nIf you're still trying to get your first win, don't give up. Build small, talk to users, and make sure you're solving something real that people are already paying to fix.",

          "body": "I’m in a similar situation now but this was my first time ever doing this. I started an instagram last summer (2024) talking about how much energy healing and yoga helped me feel calmer and more at ease in motherhood. I got a lot of traction form that and some podcast episode invites etc, started taking it a bit more serious a few months later and launched a small membership site. It was originally just yoga and meditation sessions moms could do quickly in between nap times, diapers etc., but evolved quickly after winning some outside funding  that I applied for thinking there was no shot. About 16 months from starting my silly little insta page I’m now taking my little side business even more seriously, launching a full blown alternative spiritual wellness platform made for moms of babies and young children. Hired my first 2 contractors and we pulled in about 25k this year. I am very limited w how much I work since I’m a stay at home mom otherwise so I’m only putting in like 2 - 3 hours a week on this max, even at this more “serious” stage. People make fun of passive income streams like this by saying “it’s not really passive!!” But 25k a year to only work 3 hours a week with growth every single month has been pretty solid for me and my family. Not to mention summers completely off with contractors running almost everything and growth projections surpassing 6 figures in only like 18m -24m. It’s not hard to do this stuff tbh just find the right niche, listen to whatever people’s problems are, build a strong community culture, and don’t give up. Thanks for this post bc I literally never know in context how I’m doing or if my business is even a side project or how to even talk about it. I appreciate your honesty and you taking the time to communicate what has worked for you!",

A guy reached out about two months ago saying he was trying to launch a home-cleaning business and was “really strapped for cash.” He sounded sincere, said he was trying to get his first few clients and didn’t want to go into debt.\n\nI normally charge $1,800 for the package he needed. I dropped it to $1,200 because I genuinely wanted to help someone starting out. He thanked me about five times and said the discount made the project possible.\n\nWe’re now halfway through the build, and over the past week I’ve started noticing things that don’t line up with the “barely scraping by” story. He mentioned he’d been busy dealing with a “tenant situation,” and I assumed he meant his landlord. Later he casually clarified he was the landlord. Then yesterday he said he had to move some money around because “one of the rentals needed a new water heater.”\n\nIt threw me off. People who own multiple rentals are not the same people who “can’t possibly justify” paying an extra $600–800 on a website.\n\nI didn’t go digging, but his LLC info is public and his name pulls up two properties in the county records. Nothing crazy rich, but definitely not broke. He’s also driving a much nicer truck than I expected when I met him in person.\n\nNow I’m sitting with that uncomfortable feeling where you realize someone didn’t lie outright, but they definitely leaned hard into a narrative to negotiate a discount. And I fell for it because I try to give new business owners the benefit of the doubt.\n\nI’m not planning to confront him — I already agreed to the price, and the work is fine. But it did make me realize I need to be more firm about discounts and stop assuming every client asking for a break is struggling.\n\nI guess I’m just venting. It sucks when you try to be flexible and it turns out the person didn’t actually need the flexibility. It makes you second-guess your own judgment, and that’s the part that’s bothering me more than the money.",

          "body": "Passive income is kind of a myth at the beginning, but there *are* skills you can learn now that can turn into semi-passive income later once you put in the upfront work. The stuff that’s actually working going into 2026 is mostly tied to digital assets you can create once and keep selling.\n\nThe most reliable ones I’ve seen are things like building small niche websites that earn through ads/affiliates, creating digital products (templates, guides, printables), learning how to run automated email funnels, or picking up basic video production to make faceless YouTube content. They’re slow at first, but once you understand the systems they can run with minimal day-to-day effort.\n\nThe key is choosing something you’re okay doing consistently for a few months before it pays off. If you want something low-cost and learnable from home, building niche sites + digital products is probably the most beginner-friendly path right now.",

It’s all about finding a part of the market that’s in demand but eBay sellers aren’t honed in on.\n\nOr you can do research to see what sellers are selling the most of and try to compete with them. The secret that no one gets is that convenience is a very big part of this business. There are many people out there who don’t care about finding the best deals out of 20 different websites. They will use Amazon and eBay and that’s it. So find something outside of those two sites  that isn’t being sold much on eBay and list them. I had a thought about using wholesale stores to sell things like pet food in larger quantities than other stores provide. Toilet paper, etc. That’s dropship reselling. When you list an item and it gets bought on eBay, you order it from Costco, or Walmart (or whatever) and ship it to their house. Provide the tracking numbers on eBay and then you get paid after a grace period. Don’t start with big items because eBay will hold the payout on the first few orders you get until they are delivered and eBay ensures you’re not scamming people. Then once you sell about 10-15 items and they are successfully delivered, then eBay will be more forthcoming with the payouts. You get up to 200 listings before eBay will charge you for listing items. \n\nI plan on starting this kind of side-hustle very soon so if I remember I will check back in after a month with progress report.",

          "body": "I would look into creating and scaling your own online business which can include affiliate marketing and selling digital products. The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for.

Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them.

I live in Ontario, Canada, and I’ve been trying to find a legit online/remote job for a while now. One of the biggest barriers I keep running into is that a lot of Canadian remote positions want bilingual English/French speakers — and I only speak English.\n\nMy situation is a bit urgent. I have MS, and my mobility isn’t great, so remote work is really the only realistic option for me right now. I’ve been waiting a long time for ODSP, and I need to find something soon just to stay afloat.\n\nIf anyone here has tips on:\n• Where to apply for English-only remote jobs\n• Companies that hire Canadians for fully remote work\n• Sites or communities that are actually legit (not scams)\n• Roles that don’t require a ton of physical activity or being on the phone all day\n• Any personal experiences with finding remote work in Ontario\n\n…I would be super grateful.\n\nI have customer service, admin, and leadership experience — I just need to find a chance somewhere.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to help. I really appreciate it.",

So, Upwork itself is legit, they are not scamming you in any way, and all of their fees are well documented and laid out in their terms which you agree to when you make an account. But, yeah, at the same time, it's absolutely swarming with both scammers posing to hire and scammers posing to offer work, so both sides.\n\nThe reasoning there is scammers prey on desperation, since your ability to reason and think logically is diminished as you succumb to desperation. And that's on both sides, folks desperately looking for cheap labor since they can't afford professional services and need to get work done, as well as folks desperately looking for work, like yourself. A vast marketplace rife with desperation is always going to be a huge target for scammers. And that's also the logic behind it being pay-to-play, since scammers generally just want to scam you in order to get money without shelling out even so much as a penny in the process. So, being pay-to-play reduces the effectiveness of many scammers, but it doesn't actually eliminate the problem.",

It’s annoying, especially when you’re brand new and not even guaranteed to land a job yet.\n\nThe platform is real, but the early stage feels like you’re burning money just to try to earn money.\n\nIf you’re still exploring online options, you might want to pair Upwork with something that doesn’t cost anything upfront. I’ve been messing with DropWork + ClubChain recently (their full launch is in January), and they’re running free tasks on Zealy right now no subscription, no bidding, just small quests you do on your own time. They even added a 1,000 USDT mini-game, so at least you can earn something while figuring out Upwork.\n\nSo yeah, Upwork is legit, but it’s expensive at the beginning.

So, I wrote about the pain points, my audience had, gave a partial solution that they could get relief with then linked to the full solution.\n\nIt converted to sales.\n\nThe post didn't even go viral. It got around 20K views or so in the past month. This is from one post only.\n\nThat's it.\n\nI plan on trying it again, maybe targeting a different niche to see if I get different or better results.\n\nI think the key takeaway is that Reddit marketing can be done successfully. I love Reddit for how raw and real conversations here are.\n\nI don't want to water that down with marketing but, companies are already doing it. I think if you can balance helpful, value-packed content with driving business to your brand or offer, it can be a win-win.\n\n**What do you think?**\n\n**Have you tried this?**",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone.  \nI am not much of a Redditor, but I'm struggling now and decided to ask/share here to get tome thoughts and insights, maybe.\n\nA few months ago, I lost my job and just then talking to my friend I learnt the details of her work which is link building. I did some reading and found the concept of SEO very intriguing, as it is basically you trying to figure out the rules by which Google plays and then succeed at the game (at least how I see it so far). The organic aspect of it seems very interesting to me.\n\nI must say I am from a small country where SEO is not very developed, but we have some local SEO agencies and companies that have SEO departments, both of which accept interns regularly. So I decided to give it my time and attention and learn at least the basics and try to get into the field.\n\nThe basics of SEO were pretty easy to understand. My friend introduced me to everything (big thanks to her!) and I even started helping her (unofficially) with her job a bit to get some hands-on experience in email outreach. We managed to build something around 10 links in a month with my help, and I am very proud of that, honestly.\n\nRecently I have also completed a fill SEO course which was very easy to follow and understand. It felt somewhat reassuring, seeing stuff I already knew from what my friend had taught me included in the course. I am now waiting to see the results of my final exam on it.\n\nStarting from the last week, I have also been accepted for an internship. They gave the applicants an initial task, and apparently I did it well enough that I passed. Now, this is an internship for a link building position, and we're starting from the basics, but I can't wait to start doing more practical work.\n\nAll of this being said, I want to share that even though I have been saying that stuff feels easy to understand, it also feels very overwhelming. Every single little thing/term/tactic seems to lead to a bunch more new and complex to remember things. Having no real work experience, it is very hard for me to make sense of what is actually a commonplace thing to do and what is very situational and possibly even outdated.\n\nI try my best to listen to beginner-friendly podcasts and whatnot to get some sense of trust in my own knowledge and understanding of things. Most of the time, having no paid tools to use or having no actual work experience/environment with the theory/practice ratio being something like 90/10 it feels so overwhelming and too much at times to grasp.\n\nI would love to hear how you all started your journeys. Is it okay to feel this way? Am I overthinking it, and once/if I get a proper job in the field it will get easier with more experience? I think there are a lot of us newcomers here, and I would love to hear from you too. Do you have similar stuff going on for you? How do you go about it?",

My partner: \"Stop doing that. You're leaving money on the table.\" Me: \"I'm building trust faster than I'm losing revenue.\" But honestly? I don't know if this is smart or stupid. On one hand: I've closed 2 clients in 2 months using this approach. Both specifically said \"I hired you because you told me when NOT to hire you.\" On the other hand: I've probably talked 10+ people out of paying me because I was only honest with them. That's potentially lost revenue. Am I building a sustainable business or just being naive for saying the truth that actually helps?

I would get the “wow, you’re more expensive than the other places I called” frequently as well. To which I would reply “absolutely, I am probably one of, if not the most expensive one you spoke to so far. But how many showed up to look at the property or repair before giving you a quote of price? How many showed up on time or updated you if they were running early or late? Simply put, I charge more because I am worth more.” I probably had an 80% closure rate, if not better. I didn’t keep track, but it was pretty rare for me to leave and not get a contract or sale. And the ones I didn’t get, it wasn’t very often I felt regret of not getting the job. Often times I left thinking how happy I was they declined and I won’t have to deal with whatever it was that ran the price up. Other times they would take my stupid high price and I was more than happy to deal with the nonsense because I was billing for that nonsense.",

The effectiveness depends on one variable that you did not mention: your price point.\n\nIf you charge marginal fees, telling people to DIY kills revenue because the difference between paying you and spending a few hours themselves is small. They will happily pay to avoid the hassle, so you are pushing away viable buyers.\n\nIf you charge $10,000 plus, your approach is correct. It filters out anyone who cannot afford you, saves you from low-value delivery, and establishes immediate trust with the buyers who actually matter. High-ticket service work requires ruthless qualification. A client who hesitates at 5 to 10 hours of DIY time will absolutely hesitate at five figures of consulting. They would drain time, attention, and margin.\n\nIf you are in the higher bracket, keep doing it. You are positioning yourself as the strategist who tells the truth, not the freelancer who grabs every dollar. That signals confidence, competence, and selectivity. Buyers notice that. Your close rate will remain lower, but your margin, fit, and long-term value will increase.\n\nIf your price is low, stop doing it. The economics do not support the filter.\n\nSo the real question is simple: what do you charge, and what is your target buyer’s profile? The rest flows from that.",

You telling them how easy it is or telling them how many hours it takes is not honesty, it’s nonprofit work. If you want to do that, start a nonprofit that teaches people for free or offer free courses online. Sell your service, charge a reasonable price and offer unmatched value and education with the service. \n\n2) I bet most of them probably start, get frustrated and hire someone else who will not lead them away from what they wanted in the first place. It is shortsighted for an owner to spend time on remedial tasks to save a few dollars. I’ve learned that lesson the hard way in business. You’re probably hurting them even more adding more to their plates instead of letting them focus on growing their businesses. Smart owners deploy resources for tasks they should not be doing. Now learning how it works after the setup is vital and where you come in. \n\n3) As someone who also loves to empower people as well, know you cannot hurt your business by doing so. If a client isn’t a good fit or can’t afford your service, that’s when you can spend a few minutes empowering them to DIY. That’s what we call goodwill. So if you help them out, they keep your name in mind when someone else needs your service. But not before you try to gain the service first. You are in business after all.",

They were never going to be good clients anyway. They would've been a pain in the ass, haggled on price, blamed you when things didn't work, and left bad reviews.\n\nThe 2 who hired you AFTER you told them not to? Those are dream clients. They trust you, they listen to advice, and they refer people. One good client who trusts you is worth 10 skeptical ones who think you're trying to rip them off.\n\nBy the way, I have bought products and services from folks with your attitude countless time. We need more people who offer value rather than are just marketeers. You make this world a better place. Thank you.",

And it makes me wonder what their starting point looked like.\n\nSo I want to ask the people here who actually lived it. If you grew up poor and became rich, what did you specifically do to get there?\nWhat steps did you take, what choices mattered most, and how did you break out of the cycle when you didn’t have money, connections, or a safety net?\n\nI’m not looking for generic answers like “just work hard.” I mean the real, practical path you took.

I've always had a job ever since I was 14 and I made sure in every single one to do stuff that wasn't in my job description to gain experience...many times trying to get experience doing certain specific things so I could put it on my resume for the next job. \n\nThen, when I graduated high school I went to college and got a Bachelor's Degree, worked in b2b sales for a radio station for a year before going back to college to get a Master's Degree, which I graduated with when I was 24 and got an entry level job doing b2b sales with a part time bartending job on the side and started a freelance graphic design job in my spare time. \n\nThe b2b sales job was just a stop gap until I could find a Graphic Design job. Once I got the Graphic Design job, I job hopped every 2 or 3 years...Graphic Designer to Marketing Coordinator to Art Director to Creative Director to VP of Communications, which was a $100k per year gig. All the while, I always had extra income from my freelance business. \n\nAfter almost 4 years of the VP of Comms job, at the age of 36, I quit to try and do the freelance business full time...had 10-15 core clients...rebranded the business as a 'Creative Consultancy' and went very aggressive after new clients and hired a couple of talented young designers that worked for me in my previous role to work part time projects for me on the side while I sold and handled the client service side of the biz. \n\nYear 1&amp;2 I paid myself a $38k salary...luckily my wife had gotten a promotion at work from her $45k a year job to a $65k a year job, so we buckled down and made it work. Year 3 I hired my part timers on full time at $50k a year each and knocked my salary down to $30k a year. That year propelled us forward and I was able to give myself raises in Year 4 to $50k and Year 5 to $65k. The business was making money and I had enough retained earnings to stary another business with a business partner. \n\nI'm approaching Year 7 fully self employed as a 43 year old man with 2 businesses...my Creative Consultancy where I pay myself $120k and my other business where I pay myself $30k...and my wife, a 44 yo woman, is up to $75k a year. We make $225k as a household in the Midwest, own a $350k house with around $130k left on loan with 3 cars (all paid off) and a full time camping spot on a lake. We each still have $20k in student loans but I've got about $60k in high interest savings, $120k in a 401k, and 2 businesses that would sell for probably $500k and $200k respectively. \n\nI'm not rich but I live a very comfortable life that I would have never imagined growing up. I spent half my childhood in a trailer park, the other half in 3 different apartments before my parents bought a house in the rough part of town when I was a junior in high school. Both of them have passed away but they struggled with addiction their whole lives. \n\nMoral of my story is - stay curious, always be open to learning new skills and if the opportunity presents itself to start a business and go out on your own, go for it. My wife and I both spent a lot getting educated (we both have Master's Degrees) but it paid off and we have consistently moved up in our careers. \n\nMy biggest word of advice would be to stay patient. I was so eager to move up in my younger days and I got so frustrated when it didnt happen. I was 30 with a Masters Degree thinking I should be making $150k a year because I was smart and talented and I got passed up for opporunities because rich people's kids were more connected and they did it so effortlessly that it really pissed me off and I had a complex about that until I started my own business. I control my life now...and its great. I'm not rich but, from where I came from and with where I live, paying myself $150k a year aint half bad...and I'm still growing my businesses! By 50 I want to be making $300k - who knows if its possible but I'm doing everything I can to try and make it happen. \n\nHope that helps!",

If you can’t remember it after 10 minutes, don’t buy it. Etc. etc..\n2. People will pay to make their life easy if you are around a target that you want to hit find out how to make their lives easier. That is the way you become a billionaire.\n3. Rich is literally a state of mind. If you are not happy with what you have right now you’re not gonna be happy with more. I found this out the really really hard way. Make sure you’re right inside otherwise the money will just hide the crap even more And at the worst possible time the crap will show itself and the money will go away.\n\nThese three should get you started &amp; are good anchors. Your life will kind of dictate where to go once you find your wedge be very good at what you do so that they recommend you to everyone they know. \n\n\nThe thing with a lot of people who seem rich with the cars and stuff they’re not actually rich they just have access to the things that make them look rich. Most of them are cash poor. If you can build a decent nest egg of cash then you’ll be richer than probably 90% of the people out there .",

Tried various ideas to make money, but without starting with money and support realized it would probably be better to work a career and try again after getting more time and money. I found a job that I thought I'd enjoy and pay decently. You can use government data to search careers, incomes, and expected demand to find something that pays well and hopefully is growing. \n\nNow that I have a good paying job and kind of settled down I've been thinking of trying some additional ideas. I've also always been pretty good at managing and saving money and now have the time and money to start something, but even without that, based on my current savings and career path, I will reach all of my financial goals and am on track as well. Finances are a skill that can be learned, there are personal finance subs with how to do that.\n\nI suggest finding a way to earn income whether that is some formal education or something informal like through receiving mentorship through some work path. Or even start something low cost, even if you don't make much you can learn a ton. Find a way to enjoy the journey. Work on mental health to get stable and set there. Get good at managing your money. Delaying kids but finding a great and supportive partner is helpful. And as someone else said, ask those people you encounter in person how they got to where they got, and what they recommend.

It was tough the first few years, our family lived in a 2-bed apartment and my brother and I walked to school every day. But my parents started earning better salaries and then we moved into a big house with some other family members. Can honestly say the communal living arrangement helped a lot, everyone chipped in and we were super happy and close together. It also gave us the opportunity to look after my gran, who eventually passed away from cancer.\n\nWhen I was 14 I tried to find a waitering job but couldn't get hired because I was legally too young to work. At 15 I did get hired to waiter on Sundays at a coffee shop at church. I also did some photographer's assistant jobs for my friend. He couldn't pay me a lot to help him, but it opened up learning opportunities. When I finished school I didn't get accepted into university so I took a gap year and worked 4 days a week at my mom's office. On Wednesdays I would attend enrichment classes to prepare a new application for university. I finally got in and applied for financial aid, which was accepted as partly loan partly bursary. So my family didn't have to put me through uni. I worked part-time while studying - while the other students were out partying or traveling, I was grinding to pay for my stuff.\n\nOnce I graduated, I was hired full-time. I didn't have a car or much living expenses and cycled everywhere I needed to be. I started getting some of my own clients and freelancing on the side. Eventually quit my job and took my freelancing further. That was really tough but the amount of learning I did was invaluable. I made a lot of mistakes and sometimes couldn't pay rent. My clients were kind and would sometimes pay for work upfront so I could keep the business going. In the meantime, my study debt mysteriously disappeared - I didn't get any calls, I couldn't log into the portal. It's like they forgot I owed them money at all (I was faithfully paying it every month, so maybe a bursary kicked in that I didn't know about).\n\nI went on to work for a startup and that was a big jump in upskilling. Started studying part-time again and paid for all of it cash. Moved from the big city to a small town where cost of living was much cheaper.

That led me to real estate, which crashed spectacularly in 2008 - lost everything. But that failure taught me more than any success. Started over in my 30s, explored different business models. Some friends went the franchise route with brands like Anytime Fitness or Sport Clips - lower barrier to entry than starting from scratch but still required capital and commitment.\n\nThe biggest shift for me was realizing that \"connections\" aren't just rich people you know.. they're everyone. The mechanic who fixes your car, the lady at the coffee shop, your coworkers. Every conversation is potential value exchange. Also stopped trying to invent something new and focused on doing something existing but better for a specific group of people.

Here it is:\n\n**Most people will die in the exact same socio-economic bracket they were born in.**\n\nThe greatest lie American capitalism convinced us of, is that *anybody* can be rich if we just work hard enough. **Well, statistics does not support that.** About 1% of the population actually make it from poverty to financial independence. Would you set out to try to get rich if you knew there was only 1% chance or less of making it? Probably not.\n\nBut most of us have been made to believe that number is much higher than it actually is. And it works wonders for productivity - a whole nation working themselves into an early grave trying to chase the statistically unachievable dream.\n\nSo when you see rich people who've \"made it\", they're almost always born either rich or financially advantaged already. Know this. Many pretend that it was \"all them, all hard work\" that got them there, but when you dig a little bit deeper, it's almost **never** the case. They got startup money from a rich someone, had a family that could afford to send them to Ivy League, they inherited a few properties, got their first internship at uncles company on Wall Street etc, etc. True rags to riches are very, very rare (and of course my hat is off to those - but they're unicorns).\n\nSo, the lesson I took from this realization came embarrassingly late in life, I have to confess. But it decoupled me, made me wake up to a new view of it. And it was so refreshing: I've always been self-employed, but I've now shifted my focus to no longer focus so much on the end goal and the next big thing, but to have a decent time on the way there. If I can afford to feed my family, put a roof over their head, have a vacation or two a year and afford my hobbies, friends, a few restaurant visits - then that makes me rich. Sure, I'll take becoming a millionaire still, but I'm no longer chasing that dragon - I'll let the dragon come to me if it wants to, but only if it's friendly.",

I think you need to know what you're feeling and what you really want, not to get frustrated regarding what you will go after.\n\nHonestly, your post leads me to believe that you crave social ascension and equate it to owning a business. You want to go from having no money (and no social status) to having money (and the social status that comes with it). That expectation might frustrate you when it actually comes to building a business.\n\nWhy do I say that? Well, most people don't ever invent nothing. Inventing is hard and requires a lot of knowledge, especially in a post industrial society in which knowledge is very advanced. Inventing can also be frustrating and don't necessarily lead to a sucessful biz. On top of that, most business fail, and fail spectacurly at that - I'm talking personal bankrupcy level here.\n\nWith that said, what is business? Business is fundamentally based on identifying a demand, building a solution, selling it to the market and delivering it with efficiency in a way that the customer will be supplied and happy.\n\nTo do that, you don't need to invent anything. You need to understand how it works, build the necessary skills, save money and basically risk it all in making it happen. There is a lot of failure and pain involved. Studying and getting a good job is a lot safer, if not easier. If you land a good job in the six figure department, you can have a good life (i. e. money in the bank, a good car and good house) without the risk and uncertainty involved in being a founder.\n\nIf you still choose to do it, start with something small and prepare your emotional skills to handle rejection (sales), uncertainty (money related risk) and loneliness (you will become different than 95% of people, probably including family and friends).\n\nOnce you do all that, brace yourself for a journey of personal development, high highes and low lows. Every entrepreneur has an exciting story to tell. In a few years, one of those stories might be yours. Wish you a lot of success!",

I was so happy. The client got great results and we worked together a few more months. In about 5 months I earned €250. I gave my dad €200 back and kept €50.\n\nLater I lost interest in marketing and stopped. Didn’t do anything for a few months. When I was 15 I tried again, but I had zero motivation. I stopped being disciplined and didn’t earn anything.\n\nAt 16 I bought a web dev course (€87). Finished it fast, made my portfolio, emailed clients from IG and Google Maps.

Tune out the rest of the noise, and likely people that are going to tell you every single reason why you are not good enough. That is projection.

My parents worked very hard and made very little but put all the money into educating me and my sibling. We took that very seriously and saw my parents working hard, so we worked hard at school -- no partying, no fun times, just pure studying. And studying was fun! I went to the best undergrad university in my country due to that, got scholarships (my parents paid 0 dollars), and then got a fully paid scholarship for a masters in North America. Once I finished that (with a 4.0 GPA), I got a pretty low paying tech job ($35K annual) but I switched jobs every 1.5-2 years, which led to huge increases in pay. After about 8 years of experience in tech, I went to a FAANG company at a management level which brought my annual pay to $400K. I'm also good with saving and moderately ok with investing, so my current net worth is about $700K. Thinking about where I started (with $0) about 13 years ago, I am very grateful to my parents for having given me the education and skills of choosing the right things to focus on which helped my life.\n\nSome key points worth mentioning:\n\n\\- I went for a mix of work experiences: startups/big corporations, client facing/backend, management/IC, etc.\n\n\\- I focussed on improving my people skills and communication techniques at every job I had. This is so hugely impactful and not very appreciated.\n\n\\- Being in cross cultural settings, I focussed on immersion into the culture I was situated in. That helped in being more adept at earning trust and being savvy with work colleagues.\n\n\\- Being curious helped me be aware of what is happening in the industry and where to go next.\n\n\\- Being always open to new opportunities and not being too loyal to a company or place helps. They are not loyal to you.\n\n\\- As I grew older, focussing on \"fun\" and \"rest\" became more and more important. People that only work hard and don't have a life burn out eventually. Before I met my wife I spent many years considering finding a partner as my main job and my actual job was a side-hustle, because I knew finding a partner is a more impactful decision than any other in life. Similarly, eating well, exercising, and spending time in nature sustain us to do well at work and ignoring those can really impact productivity.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or thoughts. \"Working hard\" is a good mantra but there are some nuances to it. Working smart, being curious, prioritizing not just \"work\" but also \"people\", and being serious about fun are all as important.",

We go out to eat whenever we feel like it. I just bought a used convertible (yes used, I'm still frugal) for the wife to drive around. I'll stick with my 10 year old truck.\n\nWork hard, play hard.\n\nEdit:  \nJust found out that my neighbor paid $600 to have Christmas lights hung. He's younger than me and I know he owns a ladder and a staple gun. This is what I'm talking about.",

I didn’t want my kids or wife to have to experience what I went through and it kept me motivated along with being in a circle that helped me keep my standards high.

Here is my opinion \n\n1) save for a few exceptions like very high paying jobs in the US, you will NEVER become rich by being an employee \n\n2) unless you are part of the exception for the previous point, you will NEVER become rich by saving alone,.you need to invest\n\n3) no matter how large of a ROI you have, you will NEVER get far without a sizeable investment. Sometimes is not worth scrounging up for peanuts in return. And money matters in general. Only money can open certain doors and nearly guarantee success by letting you brave the waves of pushing yourself into the market as a business. My family nearly bankrupted once as we couldn't cushion a store for long enough. Two very bad years and yet months later the place boomed... Not a nice experience \n\n4) no matter how much money you have to inject, you are STILL a slave to the chaos of circumstance. You cannot time the market, only gamble. And you will always hear biased answers of those who succeeded \n\nIn general, the path from nothing is making sure you can generate as much value as quickly as possible for you to invest in a business (more work, more risk - something you should ALWAYS be aware of -, but much higher return) and repeat. You have to be bold and yet conservative, you have to move and move and make connections everywhere to catch up to people that already has that and actually compete. And then pray to whatever god you have (literally or metaphorically) for the market to be kind to you. And then rinse and repeat. Hopefully you scale fast enough, but realistically even if you succeed it will likely take a generation or two with the same drive to get there even in the best cases (discounting outliers)\n\nAs for the people I knee that made from significant to a lot of money they could not do the same today and most did so though real estate ish: one made a jewelry business (won't name her because of doxxing), another capitalized on 2001 crisis in here and bought a lot of stuff for dirt cheap and held for a few years, now he owns entire buildings. Another one got tired of being a dentist and started selling clothing to the countryside and used the money to buy property. Another one inherited a shoe factory lol but to be hair he was a programmer and likely pit quite a bit of money I to it too, another is a lawyer and got.. lucky let's say. There are others that never reached a million but still made good bucks, mostly doctors, a few engineers that migrated, a dude that bought movies for cinemas/theaters, farmers, etc etc\n\n I'm worry for being general as I don't have a personal anecdote but I genuinely don't think there something else than it. By not having money or connections you have to work ten times as hard to even get to the starting line and you are still subject to luck",

I asked for 10% of the business and to cover my low living expenses to be his partner.\n\nThen worked like hell and that led to my first $100k after tax wired to my acct around 27 yrs old.\n\nDid this again with a different partner a few years later, told him I’d be his partner for 10%.  Because he’d already seen me work and what I could do he agreed.\n\nA few years later at 33 made my first $1m after taxes when we sold that business.\n\nYou need to try as many things as possible, quickly, so you can find out what your good at.  What you get in flow states doing and could do for days on end, that you’re actually good at too and leads to making money.\n\nThen you need to find any way you can to get a piece of the business you are working on.\n\nAt all times you need to be all in, working every second like you want it more than you want to breathe.\n\nMany things will be dead ends.

The closest insights you will get is the book “how to get rich” by Felix Dennis that was actually real insights from someone who’s done it.\n\nMost people you see living rich lifestyles have a big support system from their rich parents.  You can’t see it but it’s typically there behind the scenes.

He left his family behind, some 1,500 miles away - said he wanted to make it and seek out opportunity.\n\nWe got to chatting, told him a bit of my backstory selling across FAANG, some startups, and now being a founder. Turns out he has a background in sales and is hungry for knowledge + experience. I've been wanting to mentor a seller since I never had one myself (apart from the books I read), and this is the first time someone has actually taken me up on the offer. It's crazy considering how many people say they want to make it but don't take any initiative.\n\nI'm giving him a chance in hopes that grit and sheer determination outperform pedigree (we typically recruit from Ivy League and technical universities). I've always held the hypothesis that many people have the drive to better their lives, but not everyone has the opportunity. Now we get to test it. Anecdotally there seem to be three core elements to success in entry-level B2B; the \"Want\"; the intelligence filter; and the execution filter.\n\nI've hired him on as a BDR on a 6 month contract. By my calculations, if he's even 60% as good as I am at setting appointments, both the company and he will have positive financial outcomes.\n\nI look forward to updating the group as this progresses, and I hope this serves as a gentle reminder to take a chance on the underdog.\n\nHappy U.S. Thanksgiving to those that observe.",

More recently I got into real estate development, focusing on outdoor alternative assets. I was even designing an RV park at one point.\n\nThen shit hit the fan when our family grew by one, and I had to pivot away from that venture. I’d been working with people who were way in over their heads and outside their skill sets; myself included.\n\nOut of that mess, I ended up getting hired as a VP at a company that’s now worth 9-figures, just a little over a year after relaunch. It’s easily on track to be a 10-figure company in the next three years or less. We’re building a game-changing application of solar technology for trailers and other mobile platforms.\n\nThe CEO first saw what I could do almost ten years ago, on my first day consulting for him, when I upgraded the technical capabilities of his flagship model; changing the way he tracked his fleet (still only one in the industry doing this to this day). When things went south with the RV venture, I called him. He told me he had big things coming if I could wait it out.\n\nI did. It was brutal.\n\nBut now I’m here, developing software that’s going to help cement us as the leader in this space before we expand to other verticals. The world is our oyster at this point.\n\nSo yeah, having someone take a chance on you and proving them right is half the challenge. Proving it to yourself is the other half.",

      "selftext": "so i just hit £31k on gumroad in 3 months and the whole thing started because i was tired of waiting to build an audience first\n\neveryone says grow your instagram or start a newsletter before you sell anything. i just went straight to selling and figured out the audience part later\n\nthe method was kinda backwards but it worked. i went on reddit and twitter and found people complaining about specific problems. not general stuff like i want to make money but specific like i dont know how to organise my content calendar or i need email templates for my consulting business\n\nthen i made exactly that. like word for word what they said they needed\n\ni didnt make some massive course or 100 page ebook. i made small specific digital products. notion templates. canva kits. plug and play stuff people could use in 10 minutes. priced them between £9 and £27\n\nfirst product took me maybe 6 hours to make. launched it in a reddit comment where someone literally asked for that exact thing. made £180 the first week and i was buzzing\n\nthe thing with gumroad is you dont need traffic if your product shows up when people search for it. their discover page actually works if you nail your title and description with the exact words people type\n\nalso i tested the same products on different gumroad accounts for different niches. one for productivity stuff. one for creative templates. one for business tools. keeps everything organised and lets me see what actually sells vs what i think should sell\n\nnow i have like 8 products across a few accounts and some months hit £12k some hit £8k. this month was £31k which is wild\n\nthe biggest thing i learned is people dont buy solutions to big problems. they buy solutions to the annoying small problem theyre dealing with right now\n\nhonestly though now im at this point and its getting messy. managing multiple accounts and customer emails is taking up so much time. im terrible at the automation side of things and i know im leaving money on the table because i cant scale properly\n\nanyone here whos further along than me. how are you handling fulfilment and customer support without it taking over your life. like what tools or systems actually work because im drowning in admin stuff and i know theres a better way to do this",

Yes there are a lot of \"lipstick on a pig\" solutions that aren't that effective for tangible results.  We mainly see that with 19 year olds on social media flaunting rented Lambos.  However, you said it yourself OP, as long as it yields a return, who cares if it's AI?  In my experience, we keep our solutions simple and focused on mainly revenue generating activities.  AI isn't going anywhere but I'll agree that the bubble has a MAX of 2 years before it pops for sure.

Competitors tutors get paid only about 25% of what the parents/student pay for their lessons, while my tutors get about 55%. \n\nFor more context, I pay them 50% above the average hourly wage in my country. Most of my tutors are university students, so having full flexibility over their time and this high of a pay while working from home is amazing.\n\nBecause of that, even my competitors tutors are applying for a position at my company\nOut of what I have left after I pay them, I need to pay for everything else: marketing, accounting, software... you know the drill. I have barely enough for myself. \n\nI also teach my own student. They pay me 2-3x what I pay my own tutors. From the money I earn, I pay my rent, most basic necessities (phone, internet, gym), and everything else goes back into my business, so basically I am not earning anything from my business (I put more in than I get out) - even though I work pretty much all day every day (only had one day off since august)\n\nI also try to treat my tutors the best I can - I often ask them if there is anything they need, such as dealing with a bad student, stress, time management, or new features in our internal system, which I am also developing on my own.\n\nI can objectively say that I treat and compensate my tutors way better than they would be treated if they worked for our competitors. But I still have the feeling that I am exploiting them for my own profit (even though they make more money out of my business than I do)\n\nHas anyone experienced anything similar? Is this guilt just a product of anticapitalistic propaganda?",

The ones who aren’t happy are the anonymous throngs who say your action doesn’t live up to the standards of their nothing.  And you need to learn that their opinion is worth the same as their contribution: zero.\n\nIt’s not even an entrepreneurship problem. It’s a pessimism problem. Social media is so focused on making people passive and miserable that it feels wrong to actually do something and be happy. But that makes no sense. So take care of yourself, make honest agreements with the people you interact with, and fuck the haters.",

Three things I learned while running my own business that might help you:\n\n-\n1. You have to prioritise profit at some level; you need profit to invest in better software, staff, hardware, marketing, secure communication, data protection and on and on and on. Profit does not automatically equal exploitation. If you don't make money on top of your expenses you will not be able to grow efficiently, and efficient growth gives your employees more and improved resources, supports and non-monetary gains (gym memberships that are a tax write off for the business etc).\n\n\n2. Pay people to do things that they’re good at (this extends to software as well). Don’t waste your time being a bookkeeper with a spreadsheet when there is software or people that can do it quicker, cheaper and with their full focus. This applies to marketing, infrastructure, everything. At the start you have to do everything yourself but don’t make that period last any longer than it has to. \n\n\n3. You need to learn to look after yourself - you're current workload is unsustainable and will lead to health problems, and eventually burnout. I say this based on the fact I worked in a very similar way to you for most of my adult life (and doubly so for the 10 years I ran my business) until at 33 my brain and body decided enough was enough. I went from relatively healthy to now using a walker and being legally disabled. How will your staff be better off if you're not there. *Necessary disclaimer that my story isn’t your story, you are not me so what happened to me is indicative of what could happen to you - however there is plenty of evidence talking about the damage overworking does to our brain and body long term.*\n\n-\nYou're actually helping more than just your staff, you’re forcing your competitors to improve their conditions to retain good talent.

Plain language like \"machine 3 shows increasing variance in cycle times on morning shifts, correlates with temperature readings, likely warmup issue.\"\n\nThe thing that blew my mind wasn't the AI being smart. It was realizing how much time we wasted building visualization tools when what people actually needed was someone to look at the data and tell them what matters. AI does that now. Not perfectly, but good enough to point the engineer in the right direction instead of staring at 50 columns wondering where to start.\n\nThe other one that surprised me was using AI for technical document analysis. Client sends over a spec sheet or compliance doc, 80 pages of dense text. Used to be half a day of reading.

That's table stakes now. \n\nBut the real leverage is when you automate decisions inside workflows. Like: \n\n1) Auto- routing support tickets based on sentiment analysis (not just keywords)\n\n2) Dynamic pricing adjustments based on competitor monitoring + inventory levels\n\n3) Lead scoring that automatically triggers different nurture sequences based on behavior patterns.\n\nThe difference: task automation saves you time. Decision automation give you operational leverage that scales without additional headcount.\n\nThe gap most people miss is they automate execution but keep decision-making manual.

Customer Service: If you have a **shopify** store and runs campaign or do marketing on **instagram**, it can answer all of your customer enquiries in real time regarding product info, order details, shipping information and anything you have on Shopify. It only escalates the conversation to admin if an AI cannot answer. \n3. Job Hunter: You provide your preferences, skill sets and resume. It will search the internet for the new job (including remote), finds its decision maker and sends a personalized email to the decision maker.

I was actually pretty good at it too. Booked them 20-30 calls every month.\n\nBut they ran out of money and couldn't keep me on. So that's that.\n\nAlso broke up with my girlfriend during all this. So now I'm single, broke, sitting on all these skills I don't really know what to do with.\n\nMy old construction job would probably take me back. Good money, stable work. But honestly the thought of going back feels like I failed. Like I wasted all this time learning stuff that doesn't matter.\n\nEveryone says \"just freelance\" or \"offer your services\" but like... I have no clients, no real portfolio, no clue where to start.\n\nBeen thinking about doing free work or super cheap work just to get case studies and actually talk to people. But idk if that's the move or if it just makes me look desperate.\n\nThe frustrating part is I can build websites fast now, set up email campaigns that work, automate outreach - all this stuff that should be useful. But none of it matters if I don't have anyone to actually do it for.\n\nHas anyone been through something like this? Like a career change that just feels completely stuck?

I'm a mobile mechanic that started to after I lost my job. \n\nI don't have nearly any of the skills you have, I just set up a Facebook business page with some AI art for a logo and something made in Canva and just jumped on every post I could find of people needing mechanic work, took a couple easy jobs cheap just to get some reviews and while I'm still slowly building up and now working on nextdoor (you would probably go great on nextdoor, I see several people say looking for handy man, electrical, plumbing, all sorts of work). I'm flying by the seat of my pants just trying to look as professional as possible and doing good work. \n\nNow all that being said if you absolutely need cash in hand now like gonna get your ass evicted I would humble yourself, go back to the old job and get that stable check while you build yourself back up. I wouldn't think of it as failure unless you give up on trying again. \n\nI would work their while stabilizing yourself, work to keep bills and expenses to a minimum and save up for making a few years get like 3-6 months expenses fully saved up or if you can a whole year, meanwhile set up your business and start it as a side hustle where you can (I know construction usually has a lot of overtime but also sometimes you get laid off, id use the lay off time or times you don't have over time for you side hustle). Basically get reviews, get some customers in your pocket and then you have a really really stable platform to jump off of. \n\nThe first way you could make it but it's risky and you basically need to hustle like a mf to make it where the other way will take a bit longer but you'll be more stable. Just depends which way you want to go.",

Over the years, one thing became very clear: **ERPs don’t fix inventory problems, only strong SOPs do.**\n\nI’ve seen companies implement expensive systems expecting accuracy to magically improve. Instead, the ERP ended up exposing the same issues they already had: inconsistent receiving, undocumented stock movements, incomplete BOMs, and irregular counting routines.\n\nOn the other hand, I’ve also seen small teams using modest ERPs achieve excellent accuracy simply because their SOPs were clear, enforced, and part of daily operations.\n\nThe ERP is just a tool. If the underlying process is weak, the system amplifies the chaos. If the process is strong, the ERP becomes a powerful enabler.\n\nSo after many years around these systems, my biggest takeaway is this:  \n**Get the SOPs right first. The technology will only perform as well as the discipline behind it.**",

Buyers knew exactly what they wanted, but it was often hard to find these technical books at local bookstores. Amazon delivered them to you. These technical books were their beachhead.\n\nThis allowed them to prove themselves and they quickly expanded to other books, then DVDs then home goods. Now Amazon is the everything store.\n\nIf you are just starting or trying to grow your business think carefully about your market entry strategy. You can't sell to everyone at first.

A strong beachhead targets a tightly defined group with a painful, immediate problem, one that doesn't require educating the customer and can be reached efficiently.

      "selftext": "I am 27 years old and I am both a sailor and a trader. I manage to save 20-40% of my salary plus what I earn from trading. A few years ago, I was quite enthusiastic about the field, but I have reached a point where this life no longer satisfies me. You are probably wondering why... Well, a year and a half ago, I met the woman who represents me, the kind of woman I dreamed of being with, and going on voyages has become increasingly difficult. I work one month on a ship and one month at home, and I get paid 100% of the same salary for both months. At work, I started to experience anxiety and racism. I simply wake up unmotivated. I don't want to do anything, just let the days pass and go home. The food is very bad, I always have stomach problems, and I always miss home and my loved ones. For now, I have an emergency fund that will cover my expenses for about 8 months. My goal is to reach an amount that will cover 24 months of expenses and then focus on trading and another business I want to start with my girlfriend. I thought about saving some money in addition to the emergency fund for any unforeseen circumstances in the coming year. What do you think? Am I being realistic about what I want to do? Next year, I want to start that business and gradually give up my job. Do you think it's a good idea to quit even if it doesn't pay as much as my current job, even though I have my savings?",

Most people quit a job with nothing saved.\n* Trading isn't a business, it is a legal form of gambling. Investing is putting money into things for the very long term and letting natural highs and lows average out over time. Trading is guessing the highs and lows, and sometimes picking the winners, and sometimes picking the losers. Head over to r/PersonalFinance and read the hundreds of horror stories of people who blow tens of thousands in savings chasing wins \"trading\" digital currency or stocks. At least r/wallstreetbets calls it what is is... a \"bet\" aka \"gambling.\" Get that through your skull or you'll end up another broke sob story.\n* Starting a business is hard work. Other than wanting out of your sailor career, what do you know and what skills to make you successful? What kind of business are you starting? Also, if you can start it with a person who is on the short 100% of the time, is it good enough to start NOW and let them run it when you're away, and then when you're there you bust your ass for a month? Then you build up to something so that when you quit it already exists and is making money!\n* Your girlfriend is... to be blunt... your GIRLFRIEND. Not your wife (yet). The intensity of your relationship will go up immensely when you are home 100% of the time, and even moreso when you start a business together. You're putting a lot of stock into that working out, and spoiler: business with family and romantic partners often ends badly.\n\nSo... your plan as presented here kinda sucks, other than saving money.\n\n* Keep saving.\n* We all dislike our work, whether we are self employed or not... get over it.\n* Stop gambling in the markets. It isn't a business.\n* Make a plan for your business. Test your product or offering. Do market research. Perhaps start your business anyway with a partner on the shore.\n* Have some more time with your girlfriend before you upend your life for her. Don't risk ruining a good thing by tying y'all's financial future to starting a business together.",

But that's me. You don't quite your job until you are confident the business will fulfill your needs moving forward. And not just that, but also able to fund it's growth and the hard times while still fulfilling your needs. That's not a common thing, so the default is always no.\n\n  \nNot to poke my nose where it doesn't belong, but is it possible the racism you are feeling has less to do with your race and more to do with \"I simply wake up unmotivated. I don't want to do anything, just let the days pass and go home.\" ?\n\nI mean, I don't care what your race is, but if even you describe yourself this way, i'm not going to like working with you. I would specifically try to avoid you. Very common that many would act out against you. Especially in isolated workplaces like that. And when people do that, they use anything to show their frustrations with you. Which can look a lot like racism, or be misconstrued as racism. But the root cause was that you aren't pulling your own weight. Or your attitude brings people down in a job that probably needs a positive vibe.\n\nNot trying to tell you what you are experiencing. Just trying to say you seem like a reasonable person. You might just be misreading the situation is all.",

You could lose 1 year worth of your money in one trade (depending on how risky you are).

We used to have someone on the team doing all of that, and it would eat up hours every week.\n\nWhat’s really surprised me is how much headspace opens up once the repetitive tasks are gone.

AI didn’t replace the work, it just cleared out the clutter so I could actually think again.\n\nFor example, I’ve been using ChatGPT the way you’re using it for small, purpose-built bots that keep my brain from melting. One watches competitor messaging for shifts, another cleans up client briefs so I’m not decoding chaos at 10pm, and another drafts creative angles so I never start from a blank page.\n\nI’ve also fallen in love with anything that automates the micro-tasks I used to ignore. Motion has been huge for this cause it plans my day for me based on priority and energy levels, so I actually stick to my workload instead of drowning in it. And for client acquisition, Clay has been a game changer. It scrapes, filters, personalizes, and preps outreach in minutes, so prospecting feels less like punishment.\n\nWhat’s funny is that none of these tools are flashy cause they just remove friction. And when you remove enough friction, your business suddenly feels lighter, like you’re not fighting it anymore.\n\nCurious though. Have you tried anything that automates your pipeline yet, not just your workflow?",

      "selftext": "I was broke, working in McDonalds, and desperate to break into what people call financial freedom. The idea of doing what I wanted, when I wanted, with whoever I wanted was incredibly appealing.\n\nI tried everything from trading to dropshipping to mowing lawns, but nothing worked. I was either trading my time for money or losing more money than I earned, always ending up in the negative.\n\nOne day I came across a TikTok video saying the best business to start is the one built around your hobby or interest. Something I realised later, which I think more people should understand, is that when you turn your hobby into a business you never really feel like you are working, and you end up with limitless motivation because of it.\n\nSo I started brainstorming and realised I had a valuable skill. I could go through people’s computers and find cheats or anti-forensic tricks used to hide them. This was known as PC Checking, and it was common in GTA, Minecraft and Fortnite communities.\n\nI was a checker in a few of these communities and eventually found out there were automated scanners that made the process faster and more consistent. They worked well, but they had a major flaw. False positives. Tons of them. They caused arguments, uncertainty and unresolved disputes, and the owners of these tools rarely communicated or seemed to care.\n\nBecause of that, I decided I would create a scanner myself with the lowest false positive rate possible, and I would be an active, communicative owner. That was the moment detectac was born.\n\nFirst I had to build the scanner, which took a few months with the help of my friend wirespider87. When we released it, we got no sales at all, which we expected. So I moved into the marketing stage. I partnered with Discord servers, made videos detecting the biggest bypasses at the time, and uploaded trolling cheaters on YouTube.\n\nMonth one: one sale.  \nMonth two: two sales.  \nThen it doubled every month until we hit £5k in month six.\n\nThat was the breakthrough. An extra £5k on top of my McDonalds job, but eventually the job started getting in the way, so I quit. It was the best decision I ever made. Since then I’ve kept improving detectac and today it is the market leader in PC cheat forensics, protecting over one million players across 12 different games.\n\nJust a crazy story I wanted to share to give someone a bit of motivation. It can happen to anyone if you put in enough work. Try your best, stay consistent, and you never fail if you refuse to quit.",

Is money the only motivation?\n\nLike lets say for example, i know if i bring something from China lets open a perfume brand. Now perfume is not something that after starting i am changing someone's life or doing something so unique that i will be satisfied.\n\nIts just business i do it and make profits.\n\nSo, business like those that dont have deeper meaning, or changing something or its just making money, how do you guys keep doing it? (i understand if money is the motivation but do u feel like u want more?)\n\nI keep stopping myself from doing something to find deeper meaning behind it. might be my mind giving me excuse but i really wanted to know this ",

The freedom to be my own boss is worth more than any amount of money (although they do help each other). \n\nOthers do it to master something. Others have a bigger purpose that gives them meaning.

No. Does it make the most sense to me and is it something that can give me autonomy, good scalability, and possibly great profits? Yes!\n\nIn order to be successful in business, you have to start something. Who cares if your first thing has meaning to? Technically every product has meaning to customers, otherwise they wouldn't purchase it. But this doesn't have to be your forever business. Maybe you will grow fast in a year or two, sell the company and use that money to finance other more meaningful business plans.",

They like giving customers something that actually works. They like the freedom the business gives them. They like seeing an idea turn into a sale. That alone can feel satisfying even if the product is not saving the world.\n\nAnd honestly, most businesses look “shallow” from the outside. But to the customer, a good perfume, a good bag, a good tool, a good service can make their day easier. You do change someone’s life in a small way. You make their world smoother. That still counts.\n\nMoney can be a motivation, but it doesn’t have to be the only one. Some people find meaning in building something stable. Some in helping their family. Some in creating a lifestyle they actually enjoy. Some in the craft of running the business itself.\n\nIf you wait for a “big” purpose before you start, you’ll stall forever. Most people find their meaning after they start, not before. You niche down, you learn who your ideal customer is, you dial in your offer, and somewhere in that process you feel the spark.",

You can make someone's day just by selling them a perfume they love. You get to help them feel good about themselves (I know I love when I smell delicious!). That's important.

If it's a low cost item, it's still the same concepts but a faster process. \n\nThe first thing is to schedule a face to face meeting. Zoom is OK but if the product is tangible, meeting in person is best. \n\nIn the meeting, try to establish rapport if possible. This is an advanced skill but if you can do it, do it. If you can't, don't. There is nothing worse than insencerity or patronizing behavior. \n\nThe next step is consultation. When you're meeting with a potential client, ask then what their problem or need is and why they considered your product. Let them speak. Don't rush this part of the process. Don't draw it out more than you need to either. Ask lots of questions about their goals and make sure you have a solution. If you don't have the solution, stop right there. Don't sell a square block to fit a round hole. That will lead to bad reviews.\n\nOnce they are done giving you their needs and wants list, explain why your product can solve their problem. If possible, provide a demo of the product. \n\nThe next step is to see what objections they may have. To do this, ask what questions they have about the product or service. Once you answer the questions, ask if there are any more questions. Repeat this process until they are certian your product is the right choice for their issue. \n\nThe last step is to assume the sale and proceed to the close. In this step, you want to essentially ask them if they are ready to buy. If they say no, there are usually only a few reasons. 1. They don't have the money. 2. They aren't a serious buyer. 3. They aren't convinced that your product is the solution. 4. There is a better price elsewhere. 5. They need to think about it. \n\nIf you can, offer financing for 1. You're not a bank but you can find someone who will help finance most purchases for your clients. \n\nYou can't do anything about 2. Just politely walk away. \n\nIf it's 3, go back to the question and answer phase.\n\nIf it's 4, ask them what is stopping them from buying. If the competition has a better product, see how you can provide a competitive advantage (lower price, faster delivery, guarantee of some sort, etc).\n\nIf it's 5, thank them for their time and schedule a follow up meeting at a later date. Where possible, cut the date time in half. If they say give them a month, follow up in two weeks. The followup can be simple. Hey it's me, I just wanted to see if you have any questions about &lt;product&gt;. \n\nAsk me any questions.",

So, it necessitates identifying potential customers, understanding their needs, presenting solutions, handling objections, and earning their trust for deals. At its core, sales is about building relationships and delivering value by matching customer problems with appropriate solutions, creating mutual benefit for both buyer and seller.\n \nNow what can learn from the other resposes to your post?\n\nPeople from people, where they will ask from you if your communication is spot on. Here is the good news, it is rare that anyone is spot on on communication.\n\nSecond, you have goals for what you want to earn.  As you communicate to clients, you will learn their goals if you earn their ear, interest, and trust. Some would say learing to communicate at the buyer's listening level to be the art of sale or 20% of the sales engagement.  For example, if i understand Mr.Client this issue is burning a hole in your pocked book. So, if you had something that would solve this issue. Then you would take it.  As it happens, I have it right here.  Check it out. Oh wow, that's exactly what I need. How much to take it off your hands.\n\nThird, to achieve your goals and gain an opportunity to communicate with clients generally requires a system or processes to get there. These proceses are 80%of the sales engagement.  It needs to be applied consistently and at  a regular cadence.  For example, what is your strategy, who is your ideal customer profile, what are the ways to reach them, how will you communicate to them, what are the systems you have in place to help the processes and more.\n\nI had a ton of help in my sales success. It sounds like it is similar to those who replied to your post. Therefore, you can learn in this Reddit at no cost.  Guess what, what, how, when, why, who to ask questions is an art and a vital sales skills.  Additionally, you can chat with everyone who responded directly, if they agree.  I for one have no issue.  As for expensive, there are plenty of good coaches out there who charge between $150 to $500 an hour.  The gap is if they need to do some homerork to help you in your situation.  There are also good ones who deliver workshops, and more where you can learn.\n\nLet us know how we can help.",

He assumed that we just wanted to keep him on retainer so he didn’t say anything  \nFirst of all retainer is CRAZY. He just kept getting paid because nobody turned off the recurring payment when the project ended!!!!  \nI checked with the team and everyone thought someone else was still using him for stuff. We’re 24 people like how does something like this even happen?\n\nApparently he’s been receiving 1.5k every month for 10 months and figured we knew what we were doing which honestly fair cuz that’s on us not him  \nThe worst part is he’s a nice guy and offered to pay some of it back but like legally that’s our fuckup not his. We just gave him $15k for nothing because nobody communicated...........\n\nHow do you deal with this if you don't have a proper financial team set up?",

The first one might be that you never pay anyone that doesn't send an invoice. The second one might be that two founders need to review each check before it goes out. Presumably, a founder would know whether someone is on retainer or not. The third one might be that a note gets set up in QuickBooks about each account. It indicates whether the person is on retainer or not. \n\nThis stuff isn't hard. It just takes someone dedicated to setting up processes in your business. Someone needs to take on the role of operations and implement standard operating procedures.\n\nLastly, the designer you overpaid needs to pay back the money.

The breakdown wasn’t noticing the expense, it was assumptions and communication. This was a known vendor, so the expense was assumed to be valid and being used by one of the 24 employees. Everyone assumed that someone else was using him each month. \n\nIt seems to me that this is more likely solved by having a designated point person for each business activities. That person knows whether any dies in services are being used, and if a department needs design services they talk to the lead and ask for the services. I’ve had it in my business too where people assume the other needed to buy that thing, when no one was really managing it.\n\nAnd this is really dependent on the size of the business. No matter how many financial reviews I’d have with budgets and expenses, $1500 a month wouldn’t show up unless we pulled up a transaction list and reviewed it. A larger business will have too many to go through. I have people who do go through every transaction, just like OP, but again they assumed it was legit. \n\nA business transaction $10k-$20k per month would notice and correct this before it was paid that first month. A business transacting $5m per month won’t ever see this.",

And he kept getting paid something like $400/hr for every timesheet he put in, including any overtime he decided to rack up.\n\nNearly a year later, someone started asking questions, and he was (finally) kicked off the contract. But the department couldn't recover the better part of a million dollars they'd paid him by then; he'd quietly followed all the rules of the original contract, done all the work his many, many bosses had tossed his way, and the switchover from hourly rates wasn't something which happened automatically on a given date - it had to be signed off by one of the managers employing him.",

If they bought a long time ago, they likely won't even notice or care.\n2. They won't be pissed at all, and will instead see it as an opportunity to buy more of your products or buy backups/duplicates/multiple colorways of what they already own (depending on what you sell). This will actually make them feel BETTER about their original purchase, as bringing the overall average price of multiple items down for them makes them feel like they're getting a \"steal\".\n3.

He turned into someone completely different, never helped with anything and I was sick of it. I finally got him to agree on selling the business and parting ways and it was delay after delay. “One more push to get our profits up so we can sell for more”. That never stopped and finally he said I don’t want to sell anymore. I said f it, and asked for his terms for me to exit. I have no regrets. Outside of the partnership being a disaster dealing with employee BS, complete gut punches anytime there was a negative review, things seeming like they are going great and getting hit with a shit pile. I couldn’t do it anymore. I tried doing it differently, I tried sticking it out, I tried new methods of communication, I tried everything. \n\nWhat I am grateful for is I went through severe burnout for the first year and mapped out everything I was spending time on, started journaling and meditating and these two things alone changed my life for the better. I was able to manage the shit storm of the small business, but ultimately saw no end in sight. I know social media makes it seem like you should never quit, keep going, grind it out, it will get better. Sure maybe. But also it might not. What’s your piece of mind worth? I lost money, but guess what? before I stopped I was losing money, my time, and my peace of mind. So I decided I only wanted to lose money moving forward. \n\nWill I start another business? Yes, but it will be under my terms and with more clarity. If you feel like you’re never moving forward it’s ok to stop. Chances are you’ve learned a shit ton, and can takeaway some great things from the experience as I did. \n\nIt’s ok to step away. You didn’t fail, you learned. This is not advice to quit but rather determine whether or not it’s time to move on or change how things are going. \n\nHope you can take your life back one way or another. The only thing I urge you to do is start meditating, journaling, and mapping out your time.",

Since making those changes, she has acquired three companies and blew her not modest revenue goal out of the water. \n\nYou can do this, you just need to step back and look at what you're doing.",

Then I learned one of the simplest and, at the same time, the hardest things to do.   \n  \nDELEGATE.   \n  \nDelgating relieves stress, let's you do so much more in a day, gives you more time to actually work ON the busines not IN the business.\n\nNow you might say, I don't have the money to pay someone or the time to train someone. I understand. \n\nHowever, you CAN delegate through systems even while it's just you. \n\nI've also heard people say \"well you know, we can start working on systems when I'm big enough and have a whole team, etc.\" \n\nI'll tell you from years and years of experience, that's the wrong type of thinking. \n\nSystems include everything from how you start your day, to how you end it.   \n\n* Could be as simple as a customer request system to manage issues.  \n* Could be a checklist to ensure that things are done correctly the first time so it's not an issue later.  \n* Could be scheduling your day and week around which day you will troubleshoot and which day you will sell or work on new projects. \n\nIf you are experiencing the same types of issues all the time, you absolutely **must** build a system around ensuring those issues don't keep happening. \n\nIf you are willing to do that, I promise the burnout feeling will start to go away. THEN, you can hire someone to manage the checklists you've built to ensure that these issues don't happen and when something new happens, it goes into that checklist for next time. \n\nMost people run their businesses like they are self-employed.   \n  \nI want you to keep this in mind going forward:   \n  \n**Your success, or lack thereof, is a direct result of the limitations you impose on yourself.** \n\nEnvision what you want you day to look like, then actually build your life around it. \n\nYou can start by fixing ONE recurring problem each day.   \n  \nBy the end of the week, you will be surprise in how much you can turn things around.\n\nDo this for 30 days, and your life will positively change in ways you wouldn't have thought possible.",

Not sure which scam this is. Could just be a generally terrible loan with bad terms no one in their right mind would agree to. If it’s a standard advanced fee scam. “You’ve been approved for this loan, but we need 10% up front as a guarantee. We take bitcoin/giftcards!”\n\nAlso, of course, they’ll need all of your personal information for credit check purposes and whatnot. On the back end they will sell this info to other scammers who will use it to make themselves seem legit. “Is this First Name Last Name from X Address? I have a warrant for your arrest!”. You fell for one scam, so you’re a proven mark. You’ll get plenty of calls trying to scam you again. “Is this FN LN?

That isn't the point of the sub and the ease of creating AI wrappers or vibe coding apps has made it so bad the noise from these posts are blocking out real questions about small business. \n\nThis is particularly annoying given anyone can look at our past posts and create a map of what is important or challenging for small businesses with far greater accuracy than a single spammy \"question\" post.\n\n- Research on small businesses (i.e. asking what their challenges are, if XYZ app will help, how good your small business offering is, etc.) will be removed unless posted by legitimate academic sources. Additional rules will apply for academic research.\n\n- Posts of this type will be allowed as comments in one of our stickied posts. If these comments engage widely we may set up a new sticky for them.\n\n- We still only allow questions to be posted. Mods may post or enable non-questions for specific purposes. These are generally PSAs but can be about critical events.\n\n- As before, posts directly or indirectly for promotion will be removed, including those authored by AI. Using AI to translate might be OK but AI slop is not.\n\nAs always we welcome feedback on the rule change. \n\nAs a separate note, you might like to know we've been operating several posts as anti-spammer honeypots. These are posts are popular but highly attractive to spammers. The posts are under continuous monitoring and when a spammer makes their comment the company name or offer is banned universally across the sub. Banning the company name means even different accounts can't spam us with it. Feel free to tell folks we operate honeypots. If the bad guys know there is a risk to posting here perhaps they'll send the spam somewhere else.\n\nThanks for your posts and I look forward to hearing your comments - even the critical ones - as we always have room to improve.\n",

I’ve never had a client behave like this and I don’t have a mentor to run this by.\n\n**The Context:**\n\n* I have a client who started construction **before** the building permit was issued. He is currently panicked because he’s risking a Stop Work Order or worse.\n* The City review process has been frustrating. The reviewer used generic \"boilerplate\" comments and didn't mark up/redline the reports, just the plans. This ambiguity caused a 3rd review cycle.\n* The City charged a re-submittal fee. It is **$150**.\n\n**The Conflict:**\n\n* The Client is demanding I pay this $150 fee out of my own pocket.\n* My contract (and industry standard) states that all agency/permit fees are the Owner's responsibility.\n* I am currently fighting the City to waive the fee on his behalf because I agree the review was lazy, but I told the Client I will not pay it personally if the waiver is denied.\n\n**The Behavior:**\n\n* He is texting me \"???\" late at night.\n* He told me \"I’m a businessman, I know how this works,\" and accused me of \"not taking ownership\" because I won't pay the $150.\n* **He has threatened to sue me.**\n\n**My Position:** I feel like he is projecting his anxiety about his illegal construction onto me. He wants me to pay the fee to validate his narrative that the delays are my fault, not the City's or his own. I’m holding the line on the $150 not because of the money, but because paying it feels like an admission of guilt/liability.\n\nHas anyone dealt with a client like this? Am I wrong for refusing to pay a small fee just to make him shut up, given that he’s already threatened legal action?\n\n**TL;DR:** Client building illegally is trying to bully me into paying a $150 City fee and threatening to sue. I'm standing my ground.",

I was actually pretty good at it. Booked them a ton of calls. \n\nBut they ran out of money and couldn't keep me on. So that's that.\n\nAlso broke up with my girlfriend during all this. So now I'm single, broke, sitting on all these skills I don't really know what to do with.\n\nMy old construction job would probably take me back. Good money, stable work. But honestly the thought of going back feels like I failed. Like I wasted all this time learning stuff that doesn't matter.\n\nEveryone says \"just freelance\" or \"offer your services\" but like... I have no clients, no real portfolio, no clue where to start.\n\nBeen thinking about doing free work or super cheap work just to get case studies and actually talk to people. But idk if that's the move or if it just makes me look desperate.\n\nThe frustrating part is I can build websites fast now, set up email campaigns that work, automate outreach - all this stuff that should be useful. But none of it matters if I don't have anyone to actually do it for.\n\nHas anyone been through something like this? Like a career change that just feels completely stuck?

Keep in mind that only 1% of startups ever make it big, and the next 20-30% have a mediocre exit often at a loss where employees don’t make much money at all. You could’ve been \"wasting\" years there and not make any money. That is to say, failure is an almost expected outcome for most startups. \n\nYet, if you understand the likely monetary outcome, joining a startup is an amazing opportunity to learn and grow on many dimensions. You said it yourself: you learned about a bunch of tools, techniques, and became good at it. Don’t discount how that may help in often unpredictable ways in the future. \n\nMy take: Go back to construction, own the experience and learn from it. Reframe the failure in your own mind. And rebuild your financial foundation and do some reflection over a year or so. If you want to give a startup another try you can always apply / look around in the future.",

Of course this is something I’m mostly interested in. I’m looking to get into Cyber security. You can try Data Analyst, IT, and many other types of tech jobs. I’m not the smartest tool in the shed but I’ll tell you what, I can’t keep going on breaking my back for a job that if I get hurt I’m literally gonna lose everything and have no back up plan. Imagine getting a tech job and working from home. Not all tech jobs are like that but many are. Plus the starting salary will be comparable to what you’re likely already making, maybe 40-50k and after you get some experience that can go up to 70k to 100k+ depending on the field you’re getting into. Many variables like how big the company is and how much you keep learning and pushing yourself to the top. And I’m gonna be honest, you’re gonna need to spend probably about 4 hours a day studying and some certification exams cost about $350 or more. But people spend 80k to study this stuff in a college and go into debt. You can do it at home for a few thousand dollars and get multiple certificates in a year or two and start applying for jobs.",

          "body": "The \"no ads\" approach works until you need predictable revenue, then it becomes your biggest bottleneck. Organic growth through word-of-mouth and social content is great for validation, but it caps your growth at the speed people naturally share - which is slow and inconsistent.\n\n\n\nYour question about \"how to get customers fast\" reveals the core tension: fast customer acquisition requires paid distribution. You can't manufacture urgency and demand at scale without putting your offer in front of targeted audiences systematically. Facebook and Google ads let you control exactly who sees your cookies and when.\n\n\n\nStart with $10-15/day on Facebook ads targeting your local area with a simple offer: \"Handmade cookies delivered today in \\[your town\\]. Order by 2pm.\" Use photo carousel ads showing your actual cookies, not stock imagery. The algorithm will find people who click and convert within 3-5 days.\n\n\n\nThe mistake most food businesses make is waiting until they have \"perfect\" branding or enough inventory. Start running small test budgets now to learn what messaging works, then scale when you have capacity. Spending $300-500 in your first month will teach you more about customer acquisition than 6 months of organic posting.",

It recently became my responsibility to reconcile the UPS invoice we get weekly and it has become clear that UPS is essentially scamming us out of hundreds of dollars a week. I wanted to see if others have been having the same experience. \n\nWe are being hit with two surcharges mainly: “dimensional weight adjustments” &amp; “address corrections”. These sometimes amount to more than the original cost of the shipment, are often not valid and easily disputed, and feel very much like UPS attempting to skim money from businesses that are shipping enough to not be able to catch these additional fees. \n\nWhen speaking with our account executive, she mentions that they use an automated (I assume AI) system to image and measure packages. I’ve asked for proof from this system on a few occasions for dimensional adjustments and received nothing, but have had disputes accepted instead. She also has mentioned that the team that handles the surcharges is “third party and overseas”, which makes me think they are receiving a portion of these surcharges, incentivizing them to overcharge and not accept disputes. \n\nAnyway, just want to know if this is a common issue others who use UPS for 30+ shipments a week are experiencing.

      "selftext": "So my family's been looking at purchasing a second business. Its a reputable gas station franchise, newly established. Its a suburban area and the area has a population around 35,000 (2.5 mile radius) and nearby metropolitan city above 500k. It's near an intersection of 2 interstate highways, right off of the exit of one of them. \n\nI've been looking through the financials for the past couple of weeks, going through their franchise approval, meeting with the owners, etc and here's the basic gist of what I am expecting to get in terms of profits. \n\nThey are average in total of 123k in merchandise sales monthly. They're able to keep a 35-40% profit margin, I am getting 40% gross profit, but lets say 35%. So they're keeping roughly $43,050. The franchise takes 25% cut, leaving them with $32,288. They have 12 pumps running and are getting roughly 7,000 in their share from the franchise (franchise gives 0.05 cents on the gallon). So in a month they're grossing 39,288 before expenses. Now adding the expenses; labor (15k), card processing (3.5k), utilities (3k), operational supplies (1.4k), maintenance/repair/yard (2.8k), misc. (2k). One thing to mention is rent is really low. The location is really nice, great for a gas station traffic wise, not any nearby gas stations, but since the franchise owns the building, they say their model is to keep the rent low, so only $2,600. In that area a business like that, rent are up almost as much as 10k. So in an average month I can see myself able to keep 18k give or take. \n\nSo this is most of the information on that business I am wanting to put an offer up for. The sellers are asking $700k plus inventory. What are your guy's thoughts? Obviously I've done my research but wanting to ask from real people now.  \n\n",

This depends a lot on the area however - I'd expect more rural areas to stay gasoline-heavy for longer.\n\nIf you owned the land, I'd also be wary of having to pay the cleanup costs of removing all those underground tanks. Make sure this isn't on you to do if the business eventually ceases operating - it can cost six figures to do this.\n\nMy biggest concern is the rent. You have an amazing deal right now but do you have guarantees that they won't increase the rent by more than X% a year? If they make the rent reset to market rates, this whole deal isn't very good.\n\nAre there major repairs that need to be done? Check especially the condition of the tanks.\n\nThe labor costs seem low but I am in a state with a high minimum wage. Is this place running 24 hour?\n\nAre there opportunities for complementary businesses in the future? e.g. a car wash or a uhaul franchise?\n\nOverall though, the numbers look good ($700K for roughly $200K a year return) and everything passes the gut check.",

So say you’re grossing $20k/month (which is the right answer btw, your labour should go against direct expenses thus making your gross $24k/month),  \n\nGiven what you’ve said about the business, I would apply some nominal percent discount, I would say somewhere around 5%-10%. Wouldn’t pay more than $265,000\n\nThe other thing to consider is your labour. Are you going to be working there, or are you going to need to hire? What was your calculations on the 15k labour? If you are going to work, how many years are you expecting to do that, are you anticipating purchasing another gas station? All this should go into factoring your personal valuation for this business. \n\nAs for inventory, what is the inventory value? What was their inventory shrinkage last year? If you have a couple years of fiscal data, take the average of the last 3 years of inventory shrinkage and discount their inventory. \n\nAll being said, this business is netting around 10%, so a healthy business. Last thing I would check; what’s the nearest station, are your prices higher or lower, and what’s their proximity to major roads (freeways, etc.). If there’s opportunity to gain business then your discount as mentioned above changes.\n\nEDIT: 10% net is not taking into account owners expenses currently. Your real net, EBITDA, should be higher than 10% (at least I guess).",

To ease him in, I offered a discounted rate with the clear agreement that once we showed movement, we’d switch to standard pricing. The results ended up being better than either of us expected; his visibility shot up, leads increased, and everything was trending in the right direction.\n\nBut when I brought the pricing conversation back up, he basically said, “Why pay more if what we’re doing now works?” Which is frustrating, because we clearly agreed the discount was temporary. I’m torn between dropping him, keeping him at the lower rate, or trying again to get him to honor the original plan. I’ve explained that competing with the top players requires more resources, but I’m not sure if it’s getting through. I’m curious what others would do: should I cut the client, stick with the current rate, or push harder for the rate adjustment?",

          "body": "Honestly, once a client gets used to a discounted rate, it’s always hard to move them up, even if the results are obvious. I’d try framing it less as “the discount is ending” and more as “the level of work required to stay ahead is increasing.” If he still pushes back, then you’re basically choosing between keeping a low-margin client or freeing that time for someone who actually respects the agreement. I wouldn’t burn the relationship, but I also wouldn’t let one client lock you into a rate that doesn’t make sense long-term.

He had the opportunity to go back to an employer that can provide health insurance which he needs right now. It still doesn’t feel 100% right because I didn’t fulfill the initial agreement. I learned a lot about setting expectations with employees for next year to avoid this specific issue and other issues we had throughout the season (mostly pertaining to wage and drive time - which mostly comes back to me having bad planning and being bad setting expectations).\n\nI am a small business owner of a seasonal business. I just hired my first employee this year to help me. In the ad I put up on Craigslist, I mentioned there would be about 28-30 working days at a rate of $200 per day with a $1,000 bonus at the end of the year if he stayed with me the entire year.\n\nMy employee is excellent so I bumped him up to $220 per day with a few days of $300 and $360. Now we are getting toward the end of the season and I am realizing I can finish the remaining 7 work days on my own and there isn’t enough work to justify having an employee for those days. I would be losing out on about $1,500 by keeping him around but at the same time I feel obligated to keep him working because although there is no contract, I feel that I committed to the full season with him and I should just eat the cost and chalk it up as a learning experience.\n\nMy decision is between cutting him loose early and still paying him the $1000 bonus or keeping him on and eating the unnecessary cost of $1500.\n\nHas anyone been thru similar experiences?

          "body": "Do you want to keep this guy for next season ? I’m obviously not familiar with your business but as a small business owner of 25 years and 26 employees we’ve found that it’s been best practice to try and keep our staff and keep them tenured rather than rehiring . The opportunity costs in our business are pretty significant when it comes to training and getting staff up to speed. Our average staff tenure is going on 16 years, with some well above 20-25 years and you can’t overestimate the contribution made by experienced and well trained staff to the point we find things for them to do during slow periods just to keep them on even if some of it is low priority plus flexible work schedules and enhanced benefits. We’ve never done any sort of analysis but I suspect it costs us a lot more to train a new staff member anywhere from $10-15k per employee, compared to rewarding our experienced tenured staff a portion of this through quarterly and year end bonus. We just had two employees return after leaving the company in 2019 and 2022 and both were at least a year ahead of new staff members hired roughly the same time. Lots of opportunity costs when it comes to finding and training in our business. We will do almost anything, with reason to hold onto good talent. Not sure how hard this is for your business and industry. Keeping staff loyal has made our company what it is today which I’d say is modestly successful with year over year growth and the opportunity to increase revenue and profitability. I’m also a push over when it comes to these sorts of things but it has worked for us. The few new hires we have made end up being 50/50 in terms of their abilities and commitment but once we find someone we will try and do everything possible to keep them even if it costs us money in the short run. Sorry if we are comparing apples to oranges but I can’t emphasize just how important it has been for us to keep smart, hard working and loyal employees on staff rather than trying to replace them. During the pandemic when our business basically went from $16-17 mill in average revenue to literally $0 for about 2 years , we continued paying everyone a modified but liveable salary and we went millions 2 million into debt even with getting 2 forgivable PPP loan for almost $1 mill total, but we’re able to quickly retire that debt after 2 years whereas we’d still be pay that off if we had to restart with new hires or mostly new hires. I think doing the right thing when it comes to keeping promises has never been more important. Good luck and I hope you figure it out.",

      "selftext": "Anyone else here ever just get depressed about running their business?  I've owned my business for 9 years now.  It has been going well.  We're profitable.  I make a lot more than I did when I worked in finance.  I generally have a lot of free time and don't work 40 hours a week (I probably work about 10 to 15 hours).  On paper it's ideal.  But, even then, it's still stressful.  Mistakes get made.  Clients get demanding.  Employees are in a bad mood.  \n\nI have a key employee that is going to move out of state in about 6 months.  I actually bought his business in 2020.  He was supposed to train me to run it, but that never really happened.  Instead, he continued to work here and, despite my best efforts, sort of continued to run that part of the business somewhat separately.  I've never really gotten the two companies to be one cohesive unit.  It's really frustrating.  I knew this guy was not the best communicator, but it's been a lot worse than I thought it would be.\n\nNow he plans to leave.  I still owe him over $100,000 and I feel like he hasn't held up his end of our contract at all.  The three guys that were his employees (and are now my employees) are not really able to work without his constant guidance.  I know the wheels are going to come off that portion of the business once he is gone.  I have a feeling all three of his guys will quit.  It's not the end of the world since I don't think any of them are that great.  But still, I know it is going to be stressful.  \n\nThe past few days I have been wondering if I should just shut the entire business down next summer.  My husband says I should sell it, and logically I know that is probably what I should do.  I had a good business for 4 years before I bought this second company.  That portion of the company will still be good and runs well.  It's also quite profitable on its own.  But, man, I am just tired right now... A large part of me just wants to walk away.  But I also have no idea what I would do with myself if I didn't have the business to run.  ",

I saw the need to bring in help with bookkeeping, contracts, financials, etc…  This ended up being a “friend” that spoke a good game and insisted on being a 50/50 partner- which never was put on paper. I ultimately showed a flaw in my decision making by putting too much trust in him. Basically giving free range to all things and everything when it comes to money. So much so that I did not monitor anything regarding anything financial. Long story made short, I now have two maxed out credit cards, lots of questionable deposits and very unfair disbursements. Just a major problem with my poor decision making in letting him have that much power in MY company. \n\nI’ll be approaching him soon with all my findings but I want to make sure I protect myself from any further and future damage as he has all access to everything financial on me. I know to freeze accounts and deny purchase permissions. \n\nBut is there any program out there that gives alerts or guards against fraud? I wouldn’t put it past him to plaster my ssn all over the internet for scammers to grab. ",

Unless your \"friend\" can come up with the money, or has assets to liquidate when/IF you win a lawsuit, I would not spend another dime on him.  Do not hire an attorney, do not hire a forensic accountant, do not throw any more money at this guy in any way, shape or form... unless you have to!\n\nConsider this an expensive lesson in owning and operating a small business and move on.  Cut the cords, the ropes, the locks, access to systems, portals, cards, phones, clients, etc.\n\nDevelop an email that gracefully dismisses him from representing your business and get ready to send it immediately after you cut him off as the leech that he is.  You will get some blow back - but once he realizes you have cut him off at every pass, he'll probably go find some other person to scam and leave you alone... Unless he has the money to waste on tormenting you.  That would be the only reason to find an absolute ball busting aggressive asshole of an attorney.  It'll cost you - but the job will get done.\n\nFinally, surviving as a small business owner in the USA today is not anything like it was 20-30 years ago.  Whatever illusions you have of fairness, righteousness, loyalty - get rid of it now. No one is going to fight harder than you to survive and win at this game called \"America\". It's a dirty, disgusting situation. In the end, there is a high probability one of you will be filing bankruptcy.  Make sure it's not you!",

Just one of those moments where something weird happens and you share it because it feels surreal.\n\nInstead, I woke up to Reddit doing what Reddit does: debating whether I’m relatable, irresponsible, dramatic, clueless, valid, petty, or possibly the CEO of bad decisions. Wild experience.  The internet always finds angles I didn’t know existed...\n\nSince a bunch of the same questions kept repeating I figured I’d answer them here so I’m not replying the same thing a hundred times.\n\n• **Why let one client be around a third of your income**\n\nI run a solo design studio and I normally work with fewer clients at a time so I can focus and keep the quality consistent. But yeah after reading the responses I get how risky that is. I’m already spreading things out more so that doesn’t happen again.\n\n• **Why didn’t you hire someone or outsource when you got sick**\n\nI usually don’t outsource because then I can’t guarantee the same style or consistency for the client. And during that liver situation I was not in project manager hiring mode. I was in try to recover and still send updates when I can mode.\n\n • **Why not adjust the timeline or talk about the delay**\n\nI was actually ahead of schedule and the final deadline wasn’t anywhere close yet. So in my head it didn’t feel like something major that needed a whole renegotiation. Clearly I guessed wrong and that one’s on me.\n\n • **Why take it personally clients come and go**\n\nNormally I don’t. I’d already worked with him before and this project had more moving parts. Also there were a ton of revisions because he and his business partner had opposite opinions on everything. So yeah I got invested.\n\n • **Maybe he couldn’t afford it anymore**\n\nMaybe.. But everything was agreed on clearly in writing and there were no surprise costs.\n\n • **Why post on Reddit instead of talking to him**\n\nI did message him. A few times. No response anywhere. The post wasn’t aimed at him it was just a vent and Reddit happened to grab it and set it on fire.\n\n • **Why not just work from bed everyone does that when they’re sick**\n\nI tried. But branding work while dealing with liver inflammation and fatigue is not the same as checking emails on autopilot. I still worked on other clients where I could just not at my usual pace.\n\n • **Why was the timeline so long it’s just branding**\n\nIt wasn’t just a logo. It was the whole identity system plus website direction app screens and physical collateral. Getting everything to feel consistent and work together takes time.\n\n • **Is branding even necessary people DIY it all the time**\n\nDepends on the business. If you’re super small or testing something maybe not. But if you’re in areas where trust and credibility matter branding isn’t decoration. It affects whether people even consider your product or service.\n\n • **Are you better now health wise**\n\nYeah I’m doing a lot better. Still doing weekly check ups but working normally again...\n\n\n\nSo yeah that’s pretty much the follow up. Nothing dramatic. No cliffhanger. Just clearing up repeating questions so the comment section doesn’t start inventing new plot points.\n\nStill funny how a random vent turned into a full blown business debate..",
