          "body": "Okay I know this is going to sound so redundant but being established on survey apps and having a good freelance skill is still the best way to go about it. So I'll give you an example of what I do to make at least $300-500 a month, it's really random and not consistent but works for me.\n\nI use a bunch of survey and play to earn apps during downtime like commute or before bed. That gets me around $80-120 most months. I mainly use Swagbucks and Babki which has both surveys and games so I can switch when one gets boring. Also throw in some other random ones when I see signup bonuses.\n\nThen I do small freelance gigs on Fiverr for excel work mostly data entry or reorgnaization. Some months I get 2-3 gigs and make $200, other months nothing. It's inconsistent but when combined with the apps it usually lands somewhere in that $300-500 range.",

      "selftext": "Im trying to get verified as a seller on a couple major platforms like amazon and tiktok shop and they are asking for documentation I wasnt expecting. They want a lease agreement in my business name and utility bill showing the business address. Problem is I run everything from home right now and all my utilities are obviously in my personal name not my LLC. My accountant said mixing personal and business addresses can be a headache for taxes too. I reached out to amazon seller support and they basically said without proper business documentation the verification could get rejected. Same thing with tiktok shop, their KYC process is apparently pretty strict about having legit commercial presence. I'm doing about $15k/month right now but want to expand to these bigger platforms. Don't really have the budget or need for actual office space, just need the documentation to pass their verification process.I really dont wanna get my account suspended later because of this since this is my side hustle i let it go to this point.",

      "selftext": "Ninety days ago, I hit publish without a plan.\n\nNo niche.  \nNo funnel.  \nNo clear outcome.\n\nJust a promise to myself:\n\n**Write every day. Tell the truth. See what happens.**\n\nHere is what actually happened.\n\n\n\n## 1. Consistency Is the Real Differentiator\n\nIdeas are everywhere.  \nMotivation fades fast.\n\nShowing up every day is rare.\n\nMost newsletters die after five issues.  \nSome after ten.  \nAlmost none survive boredom.\n\nWriting daily forces momentum. Even bad days count. Especially bad days.\n\nMomentum compounds quietly.\n\n\n\n## 2. You Do Not Need a Niche to Start\n\nI wrote about:\n- Games  \n- Debt  \n- Kids  \n- AI  \n- Side hustles  \n- Being tired  \n- Being lost  \n\nPeople still subscribed.\n\nWhy? Because clarity comes later.  \nVoice comes first.\n\nYour niche finds you while you show up.\n\n\n\n## 3. Honesty Beats Polish Every Time\n\nThe most replies came from emails where I admitted:\n- I was stuck  \n- I was broke  \n- I did not know what to build next  \n- I was exhausted  \n\nPerfect writing gets skimmed.  \nHonest writing gets read.\n\nPeople do not connect with success.  \nThey connect with struggle in motion.\n\n\n## 4. Writing Creates Direction You Cannot Think Your Way Into\n\nBefore the newsletter, my head was noisy.\n\nToo many ideas.  \nToo many directions.\n\nWriting forced decisions.\n\nEvery sentence clarified what mattered.  \nEvery issue narrowed the signal.\n\nAction creates clarity. Not the other way around.\n\n\n## 5. You Learn What Resonates Only by Publishing\n\nI thought some topics would hit. They did nothing.\n\nI wrote throwaway thoughts that sparked replies, shares, and signups.\n\nYou cannot predict resonance from your head.\n\nYou discover it in public.\n\n\n\n## 6. Momentum Is Fragile. Protect It Aggressively\n\nSkipping one day feels harmless.\n\nIt is not.\n\nSkipping breaks the streak.  \nBreaking the streak kills momentum.  \nMomentum is everything.\n\nSome days I wrote at 3 AM.  \nSome days I wrote tired.  \nSome days I wrote with nothing interesting to say.\n\nThose days mattered most.\n\n\n\n## 7. Writing Builds Trust Before It Makes Money\n\nNinety days in, I did not get rich.\n\nBut something better happened.\n\nPeople trusted me.\n\nThey replied.  \nThey asked questions.  \nThey shared ideas.  \nThey followed my projects.\n\nTrust is the asset.  \nMoney follows trust.\n\n\n\n## 8. Your Life Is Content If You Pay Attention\n\nI stopped hunting for ideas.\n\nLife provided them.\n\n- A bike ride  \n- A sick kid  \n- A failed product  \n- A small win  \n- A bad day  \n\nYou do not need inspiration.  \nYou need awareness.\n\n\n## 9. Building in Public Keeps You Accountable\n\nWhen people expect tomorrow’s email, quitting gets harder.\n\nThat pressure is good.\n\nIt turned writing into a habit instead of a mood.\n\nAccountability creates endurance.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Ninety Days Is Just the Beginning\n\nNothing magical happens on day ninety.\n\nNo finish line.  \nNo sudden clarity.  \nNo overnight win.\n\nBut something shifts.\n\nWriting becomes normal.  \nSharing becomes easier.  \nConfidence grows quietly.\n\nYou stop asking, “Should I keep going?”\n\nYou just keep going.\n\nI don't plan on stopping. Look for another update in 90 days when I hit 180 days of writing a daily newsletter! \n\nComment below any questions i'll answer them all! \n\n\n",

You can learn the basics in a few weeks and start freelancing. Ive been doing email marketing for 11 years and its still one of the most in demand skills out there. All you need is a laptop\r\n\r\nFreelance writing – if you can write decent theres always work. Blogs, articles, website copy. Sites like upwork are competitive but once you get a few reviews it picks up\r\n\r\nBasic bookkeeping – if youre good with numbers small businesses need help with this constantly. Quickbooks isnt hard to learn\r\n\r\nVirtual assistant work – lots of entrepreneurs need help with random tasks. Not glamorous but steady\r\n\r\nThe faceless tiktok thing the other person mentioned can work but it’s a grind and algorithm dependent. Personally I prefer skills where youre getting paid directly for work not hoping for views\r\n\r\nWhatever you pick, spend the first few weeks actually learning it properly. Youtube has free tutorials for pretty much everything. Then start reaching out to people who need help\r\n\r\nBeing stuck at home is actually perfect for this. No distractions, full focus. A few months is enough time to get decent at something and start making money from it",

If you can't find a buyer you can always return it too.\n\n\nAlso if you go directly on amazon.com enter \"warehouse deals\" in the search field, this also lets you look through their warehouse items, however they've made it increasingly hard to see what's actually in stock without clicking on the item first. Another excellent way to source product is if you're lucky enough to have online auctions with local pickup near you. You'd be surprised how cheap you can get things simpl because you don't have competition.\n\n\nPlaces like maxsold.com list estate sales, auctions etc nearby Also places like canoe.com, keepa.com and camelcamelcamel.com are useful for finding lightning deals to flip as well. Just check camelcamelcamel to see how much it's worth regularly.\n\n\nRules, always meet in public, preferably somewhere you can get to withir 2 mins or less. And never leave until they say they've arrived. This way you don't actually waste any time if people decide to ghost you (which will happen)",

How do you do it? And how do you deal specifically with pressure and stress? \n\nThanks. ",

      "selftext": "I cannot finish large important projects\n\nI cannot finish large important projects, I know this is related to my trauma and CPTSD but I’m not exactly sure how.  I basically would like to improve my life and the only way I can do. This is to accomplish large important projects and goals, but I cannot finish. I’ve been trying to do this for more than a year.\n\nI will give you some examples: \n\nIt’s really important for me to start a side business that will actually generate meaningful income. I have exact anxiety and I’ve been diagnosed as having major depression yet I force myself to work on these projects every day. in the past year I’ve tried to start two businesses. I spent roughly 4 to 5 months on each business and they are currently at the state of being about 90% ready to launch.  I have a problem finishing the other 10% so that they are ready to present to the public, advertise to obtain new users, and begin taking payments and generating income.  The reason for this is, I work so hard on these projects and I put everything into them and become obsessed with them over the period of 3 to 4 months but by the end of that timeframe I have lost faith in my original business idea and don’t feel like the ideas will be successful in the marketplace so I just pretty much finish the businesses from a technical implementation, but I never put the finishing touches and make the businesses available to the general public. Instead, I start a new business and the cycle repeats itself.  \n\nFor instance, I made a mobile app at work so hard on it to get it up and running, technically with backend website with payment and user accounts.  At the end of several months, the app is ready to launch, but I have lost faith in my original idea, and I have no confidence that will even make money. So I never launch, instead, I start a new business.  The next business is an AI startup, I spent several months learning and programming and getting everything ready for lunch. At the end of several months, I realize that I don’t like my original idea anymore and even though the business is about 90% ready for lunch, I never follow through and now I’m thinking of starting a new business with a different idea.\n\nHow can I break this pattern? I’m considering hiring an accountability coach who will check on me and give me encouragement so I actually follow through on these projects. Is this a good strategy or am I just not disciplined? any comments appreciated.  ",

This sounds less like a discipline problem and more like you're protecting yourself from potential failure by abandoning projects before they can actually fail in the real world. Getting to 90% means you can do the work, stopping at 90% means something else is blocking you.\n\nAn accountability coach might help with the practical side of actually launching but it won't fix the underlying fear that's making you lose faith in your ideas right before launch. That's the CPTSD pattern you mentioned and worth continuing to work on in therapy.\n\nOne thing that might help is launching imperfectly on purpose. Like set a hard deadline that the next project goes live at 80% ready instead of waiting for 90%. It won't be perfect but it'll break the pattern of never launching. You can always improve it after it's live.",

Painter Bros for example lets you start small and scale up. The nice thing about franchises is they give you the business model and support so you're not figuring everything out alone.. which matters when you're already stressed about finding work.",

I charge $20 per event (shows are like twice a week usually) and people book ahead. Payment is automatic, I dont have to do anything except make sure my own car isnt there on event nights.\n\nVenue charges $50 for their lot so my pricing works. Had maybe 3 situations where someone showed up late or parked like an idiot but overall pretty smooth. The app takes a cut but whatever, still making around $160 a month for doing absolutely nothing.\n\nNow ive got a bit of money sitting aside from Stаke and im trying to think if theres anything I could add to elevate the whole thing so I can start charging more. Like maybe some security cameras or better lighting or idk what else would make people willing to pay $25-30 instead.",

You just need to figure out a way to get money in the first place to fund it first. In that sense, you could look into bonus arbitrage (basically like bank churning). You’re essentially exploiting companies that overpay for user acquisition. Like for example, a company pays a $30 bonus for a $10 subscription, which means you can profit $20 in under 2 minutes. \n\nIt won't make you rich, but it’s an easy couple hundred a month that can then funnel into ETFs.

You're not going to get rich doing this but passive income is the name of the game!\n\n*Edit*\n\nReading the rest of his comment section if you don't have any money to start with you can definitely do the online surveys other people recommending to get enough upfront cash to get started!\n\n*Edit 2*\n\nIt has come to my attention that you require a minimum of 2,000 US dollars to enable margins on Robin Hood, which might be a little steep for some initial investors but the math still maths. $2000 from you, $2000 in margin, thats ~$40 per month in dividends and ~$9.17 in interest, so round about $30 per month profit.",

One is to invest money and two is to have a business that gives you money. \n\nAfter that sure there are several small ways here and there but you will find that in order to actually generate considerable income you would either have to spend money or make a business, or both.\n\nIf you have around 300k in stocks you could make around 90k every 3 years approximately which is around 10%, and that if the stocks make sense. I suppose you don’t have that money so what’s left is actually building a business that you could automate later on, but even then, the minute something goes wrong, it turns to active income.\n\nIn other words, you either have a capital upfront (stocks, property even, etc) and make money on returns or you either  build a business that holds value and lasts. To me everything else is scam or pennies at best.",

Stuff like content + monetization (blogs, YouTube, niche sites), simple digital products, or automation-friendly services. For example, niche websites with affiliate links or ads can start slow but compound once they rank. Same with YouTube or Shorts tied to a clear niche.\n\nAnother solid path is building or licensing something small but useful, like templates, scripts, prompts, Notion setups, or simple tools. You put the work in upfront, then sell it repeatedly. Even $10–$20 products don’t need many sales per day to hit that goal.\n\nReselling and arbitrage can work too, but it’s usually less passive and more operational. Good for cash flow, not always for freedom.\n\nThe biggest mistake is chasing “set it and forget it” from day one. Most things need a few weeks or months of effort before they level off.

Made little spikes of income here and there, nothing sustainable, nothing I could confidently grow.\n\nWhat finally started working was treating one thing like an actual product business instead of a quick win. I’d been curious about SaaS but assumed it was too “serious” compared to easy hustles. The only reason I even tried was seeing a bunch of small, bootstrapped SaaS case studies in [foundertoolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) that started from where I was: no audience, no funding, just skills and time. The difference with this route was that the first dollars I made were from people paying monthly for something that actually solved a problem, not a one-off trick. I followed a validation and launch sequence I found there: weekend idea tests, pre-sell a tiny group, launch across 20+ small channels instead of only one big platform, then commit to a few months of content to keep traffic coming.\n\nMy first product is nothing crazy. It’s a simple niche tool solving one specific workflow headache. MRR is just over $1,200 right now, but psychologically it’s a different world from one-time hustles. Revenue comes in every month without having to constantly find new buyers from scratch. The biggest surprise was realizing I didn’t need some viral idea or massive audience, just a boring, well-executed system. Seeing dozens of people turn that system into $1–10K MRR made it feel less like a gamble and more like a skill I could learn. It’s still work, but it finally feels like I’m building an asset instead of chasing the next tactic.",

So if this is clearly understood and that marketers focus on real people with real needs rather than chasing money, then one wouldn't need to have hundreds of thousands followers to make money, just the right people, having the right mood, at the right time.",

I have time to learn something new, test it and figure out some way of earning decent passive income. However I am really new to this. AI is all about starting affiliate program, POD etc. But I would love to know from this community about what avenues would you suggest for me to get started? \n\nNot sure if my work profile is relevant, but i have been working as a ecommerce product manager for past 5 years or so.\n\nAppreciate your help.

I’m nowhere near quitting my day job, but it’s solid extra income I can work on in my spare time while building a catalog of content that keeps selling.\n\nIt’s adult ebooks. NSFW. Turns out there’s real demand.\n\nI sell across multiple storefronts and slowly build a reader base that follows my work. About half of my process uses AI, but the other half is creativity and editing. If you rely only on AI, you get buried in low-quality content fast.\n\nThis is very niche, and most people don’t make much. But it is possible. From what I’ve seen, there are quite a few people doing very well in this space.\n\nI also sell custom stories. They take more work, even with partial AI assistance, but I’ve made almost $2,000 this year from just five of those commissions.\n\nEdit: I learned everything through authormeta.com (the Erotica Author QuickStart Guide)",

It’s usually work now, lighter work later.\n\nThat said, here are the most realistic options people actually make work:\n\nDigital products\nGuides, templates, checklists, simple tools. You do the work once, then improve it over time. Not instant, but repeatable.\n\nContent + affiliates\nWriting posts, answering questions, or making short content that links to tools you genuinely use. Slow at first, compounds later.\n\nRoyalties / licensing\nStock photos, music, designs, or assets. Very competitive, but low maintenance once uploaded.\n\nAutomation of an active skill\nTurning something you already do (freelancing, consulting, teaching) into a template, resource, or product.\n\n\nAnything that claims “fully passive with no effort” is usually just selling the idea, not the income.\n\nIn my experience, the closest thing to passive income comes from building something small that keeps working even when you’re not actively chasing people.\n\nCurious what others here consider “passive”.

      "selftext": "I posted this to another sub and got some really good insights. I kind of wanted to see if anyone on this sub had something else to add.\n\nA few months ago, I started seeing some posts in my Instagram feed about the massive potential of making money EASILY by selling digital products (courses, PDFs, ebooks) and promoting them on Instagram. \n\nI wasn’t desperate for money or trying to escape a job I hated. I just thought it might be a reasonable way to bring in some extra income to help with my tuition. The way it was framed made it sound low effort and practical. I figured: what the hell? For a few hours a day, it seems lucrative enough.\n\nI also didn’t want to start by creating my own products, so I went the route they all recommend at the beginning. I bought 2 of these MRR courses that you can resell. I spent hundreds of dollars thinking it would pay off and that I was being smart by skipping the hard part and getting courses i can resell instead of spending time and effort creating sth from scratch (also one of their selling points). Looking back, that was incredibly naive.\n\nIt's really frustrating how misleading the whole thing is. They never talk about how time consuming it actually is to create content consistently, figure out the algorithms, write captions, film videos, edit, post, engage on Instagram. It is not a side hustle. It is a very demanding business.. Not to mention the fact that Instagram is soo random sometimes with how it pushes content. So you're basically stuck performing for the algorithm like a puppet.\n\nThey also make it feel so urgent!! If you don’t start now, you’ll be too late. If you don’t buy the course today, you’re missing your chance. That pressure is constant and intentional.\n\nAnd then there are the hidden costs. The DM automation tools, the monthly storefront fees for Stan or Beacon, and all the other monthly subscriptions that somehow never get mentioned upfront. It adds up quickly, especially for something that is marketed as low risk and easy.\n\nTo top ot off, these people selling courses act like they figured it out overnight. In reality, they took months or years to build an audience and credibility. But that part is quietly skipped over while they sell the idea that anyone can do this fast with minimal effort.\n\nI’m not saying no one makes money doing this. I’m just saying the way it’s marketed is incredibly deceptive and preys on people’s vulnerability and optimism. I really wish I had figured this all out before I spent money on this! I feel disillusioned and cheated by this whole scheme. Now I don't even want to pursue this any further because I now fully understand how time-consuming and unpredictable Instagram can be, even though I dropped a lot of money expecting an easy side hustle!\n\nYou might be wondering why I even ventured into this in the first place. I obviously fell for their empty promises and false hope. I also went into this hoping for an \"easy\" way to make money, and I was genuinely clueless enough to actually think thus would be simple and effortless. But that's on me!!\n\nThat’s it. I just needed to vent. I'm not playing martyr and I'm not fishing for sympathy. I just needed an outlet and to see how many other people made the same mistake I did. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk 😅 ",

After two weeks of minimal engagement, I realized that rushing to sell something without offering true value only left me feeling more defeated. Eventually, when I took the time to connect with my audience, asking them about their challenges and sharing useful insights, I saw a significant shift in engagement.

First thing I’d say is don’t rush into a business just because you feel like the money needs to be doing something. A lot of people lose their early savings forcing ideas that aren’t ready yet. Short term, keep the cash safe and boring. High interest savings account so it’s not just sitting there doing nothing. That gives you flexibility and buys you time.\n\nIf you want to start learning investing, you can slowly drip a small amount into a broad market ETF just to understand how markets move. No need to go all in. Think education money, not get rich money.\n\nFor business, invest in skills before ventures. Learn something practical you can monetise later like sales, marketing, editing, coding, or even running small online pages. Skills compound way faster than most “passive income” ideas you see online. You’ve got time on your side. Protect the capital, build skills, and let opportunities show up instead of forcing them.",

          "body": "Build a portfolio of dividend aristocrats that payoff throughout the months of the year. Distribute it equally so that, for example, Abbie and coke and visa pay you every January, then in the second, third and fourth quarters. Then find three more aristocrats that start paying in February and the months following your January payouts, etc and do this untill your whole calendar year is filled out. Set as many as you can to reinvest the dividends everytime they pay out. Eventually you will see this snowball turn into an avalanche as the reinvestment compounds. Keep building. Always stack these aristocrats throughout the months based on their dividend payouts. These are boring stocks. No need to watch the stock market because you didn't buy them to sell them. They are old boring companies who have saturated the market. What is exciting is that these companies have been consistently paying quarterly dividends to their owners for 25, 50 years or longer. Buy every sector or choose to leave out the ones with evil practices. It's up to you but at the age of 17 you will be starting out the way Warren Buffet and Charlie Unger did so many years ago. You can also just buy the s&amp;p 500 index fund and set it to reinvest. Just keep adding when you can and retire early when it snowballs and you can live comfortably on the dividends alone. Then stop the reinvestment in your Schwab or fidelity account (whatever has the lowest maintenance fees) and let them dividends payout every month into your bank account. Move to the least war torn economy and make sure you have a will so your nut doesn't fall into probate.",

It explains why digital products work so well when they’re done right. You’re not selling hype, you’re selling relief, clarity, or a shortcut you wish you’d had yourself.\n\nAnd the fact that it compounds quietly is huge. No algorithms to chase, no being “on,” no pressure to perform when you’re already drained. Just something useful living out there doing its job.\n\nI think a lot of people underestimate how powerful that model is, especially for creators who deal with anxiety, burnout, or inconsistent energy.

I’ve been researching digital products (like templates, guides, planners, spreadsheets, content kits, etc.) because I don’t have much capital to invest upfront. I’m not looking for “get rich quick” . I’d be really grateful for something that can realistically make around $500–600 per month with consistent effort.\n\nI keep seeing mixed opinions on niches like: creators / small businessesservice-based professionals ,students,fitness / lifestyle,niche professionals (salons, real estate, freelancers, etc.)\n\nBut I’d love to hear from people who’ve actually tried or are earning from digital products. What niches have real demand right now?,What kind of digital products actually sell consistently (not just once)\n\nI had thought about making instagram templates for nail techs or beauty businesses or content strategy but when i searched in etsy its monthly search showed up as 1. So i dont know if it will sell\n\nI’m broke but motivated, willing to learn, and can put in time.just trying not to waste months going in the wrong direction. I am so confused as to what to do, which niche to target and what to sell. I want to know which nich or what kind of people buy digital products from etsy the most. Now planners and all are very saturated and time consuming so i dont wan to do that. \n\nAny honest advice or personal experience would mean a lot.\n\nThank you 🙏",

The role is explained, the responsibilities are listed, the culture is highlighted. But the pay is missing.\n\nSalary info matters. It helps applicants quickly understand if the role is realistic for them. It saves time for both sides. It allows candidates to honestly evaluate what they can bring to the table and decide if the role is worth pursuing.\n\nEven if you can’t share the exact amount, at least include a salary range. That alone gives clarity. From there, applicants can choose to move forward and negotiate if they believe they can deliver more value.\n\nNo one wants to go through multiple interviews only to find out the offer doesn’t align with expectations. Transparency from the start builds trust and attracts the right people.\n\nApplicants deserve clarity. And companies benefit from it too.",

Anything with a growing market?\n\n4- On 3, should I chase online certifications and whatnot or just try to land a entry job? Most people around here seem to have a low opinion of certifications.\n\n5- Any recommendations on which job sites I should frequent? I'm doing mostly linkedin and indeed, and trying to get very easy jobs for low pay on Upwork, to build some trust of my profile.\n\nPlease share your wisdom!\n\nAnd p.s. this online job finding thing is really wacky on your mental status.

A few directory submissions to get things going and \\~10 nice organic citations\n* 150 \"user\"/newsletter signups\n\nI am happy with this progress given it is early days.

If targeting is necessary, should I go for broad terms like \"Brazil itinerary\" or hyper-specific like \"best restaurants Paraty colonial center\"?\n4. **Monetization timing:** Build traffic first then add affiliate links, or implement them now? I'm concerned about looking too promotional early on.\n\nI know travel blogging is highly competitive, so I'm trying to be strategic rather than just hoping for the best.

Long messages, Robotic replies, Same flow for every follower, People can tell when they’re being “processed.”\n\nThe funnels that worked best were: Short messages, Natural language, One clear purpose per step\n\nAutomation should feel like a helpful assistant, not a chatbot \n\n&gt;Real use cases I’ve seen work\n\nDifferent creators, same principle:\nCoaches → book calls from story replies\nEducators → sell digital products via keywords\nInfluencers → qualify brand leads\nAgency owners → pre-filter inbound DMs\n\nNo hard selling.\nJust structured conversations.\n\n&gt;The biggest mindset shift\n\nCreators don’t need: More content, More posting More followers, They need better conversations.\n\nOnce the DM flow was set up properly: Replies didn’t go cold, Buyers identified themselves, Sales felt natural, not forced\n\nIf you’re a creator reading this\n\nIf you’re getting: \n“Interested”\n“How much?”\n“Can you tell me more?”\n…but nothing happens after that\nyour problem isn’t your content.\n\nIt’s the lack of a system behind the DM.\n\nHappy to answer questions or break down an example flow if helpful.\nNot selling anything here just sharing what actually worked.\n",

If the owner gets lazy and starts to think they can afford to hire more people and the employees dont care cuz its just a job, quality goes down and regulars notice. or If the owner gets greedy, they start to pay themselves more, but dont plan on vital equipment needing maintenance over time. stuff like that can fail a business. people can make a bunch of money off restaurants and still let the business fail because they know how to start another one somewhere else.",

We went to one today that has been around 43 years and still packed.\n\nPeople think they have to reinvent the wheel.",

A lot of people are enticed by one (much like people are to stocks or gambling or sports, arts, politics, you get the idea) and wither without the other.\n\nPersonally we had a marketing (mostly signs, cards, flyers etc) store, a restaurant, barbershop, drugstore (convenience store? twice, among other side hustles. Some failed, some \"failed\" and some FAILED. For example the restaurant just didnt have a large enough clientele where we had it so we sold everything and mostly evened out. The brbershop worked but there was... scalping and some other shenanigans that forced us to close after a very large swindle involving a lawyer (that was 20 years ago tho). One convenience store failed because of bad timing and little cushion below it... a few more months and it would have been \\*quite\\* profitable as the zone boomed, but we ran out of money after a bit... less than two years iirc. The second one was completely mismanaged and none of us had time, it was qutie improvised, that definitely was a waste of money.\n\nGenerally, if you understand a business, have enough money and get a half decent spot, you will at the very least coover your expenses and get a little extra most of the time. I wont lie to you and say the majority of businesses are able to feed you, but a big big chunk in this gorup does. Its just that you might not be ok with merely an \"ok\" situation, at that point it is just a crappy job with no safety net either, but at that point you sell it to someone that wants something small to work on, someone ambitious would still chase the big bucks (and by big bucks I mean equivalent to a well paid profesional, bit more bit less.

Margins are razor thin, labor is expensive and let's just say attracts a certain mindset of person. And especially when a restaurant gets large, you need to hire managers to manage it for you and one or more bad managers can sink you rapidly by driving away customers and dramatically escalating your costs.\n\nAlso because the people who start restaurants usually aren't business people they don't plan for the future terribly well. They're focused on what's going to make money THIS WEEK and cover payroll, bills and so on. They're tactical thinkers because that's what a restaurant requires day to day... but the actual business of the restaurant requires strategic thought and planning. You also have to be able to step back and do proper financial analysis to figure out what's working and what isn't, and you have to be detached enough from the \"passion\" of the restaurant to even abandon things you thought would work but clearly aren't.\n\nAdd to that the fact that the business is cutthroat... and not just with other restaurants. For every restaurant there are a half a dozen suppliers who are all vying for their piece of the pie and most of those have very little competition in their particular field thanks to business consolidation. I use liquor as a great example, as a restaurant I would have to buy from a wholesaler but thanks to consolidation of businesses there are only like 3 wholesalers in town who all basically put the same prices on everything. It's shockingly easy to lose money on liquor too thanks to licensing and insurance costs, as well as the staffing and training (and wastage) that you will have with it.\n\nWith the economy the way it is, people have cut back drastically on going out to eat. It's brutal out there and I'm seeing so many restaurants literally on the verge of closing in the next few months. Most don't have cash reserves and are fighting the same uphill battles most of us fight in our daily lives; food costs are rising, utility costs are rising and in many areas rent increases are out of control. Literally my only saving grace with that restaurant is that I own the building and there are other businesses in that building that (mostly) cover the mortgage. \n\nI keep it going though so that my regulars can get their favourites, and so that my employees have a consistent paycheck. Business is 1/3 of what it was two years ago and we've had to make a lot of hard choices in order to keep it going. Even in the new year we SHOULD be raising prices because of the amount or food costs have risen since our last increase over a year ago. But we can't... if we do then any revenue increases will be offset by a reduction in volume of people coming in. 2026 is going to be incredibly hard for restaurants.",

The people who are whizzes for financial stuff or connecting with employees could be the laziest person in the restaurant. It’s rare to have all the pieces fall into place and work harmoniously. A fantastic chef can’t outweigh a terrible front of house experience, for instance. \n\n\nPeople simply think a restaurant is easier to run and manage than it is. Employee issues, ineffective management, and poor customer reviews can all be soul crushing. The unpaid bills just speed up how long it would have taken the owner to close up shop.

We get along well and we both want the same long term outcome. The part that keeps me up at night is the risk side. I already own property and most of my savings are tied up there while she does not have assets yet. To get this business off the ground I would likely need to put my property on the line through a mortgage or loan and that feels very different when it is not just my idea anymore. I am trying to be honest with myself about whether this is a business concern or a relationship concern or both.  \nFor founders who started something with a partner when one person had more to lose how did you think through risk and boundaries before moving forward. I’d really appreciate any advice :)",

You can probably get everything you need for years on Facebook Marketplace from someone who tried to do this and got bored. Get a logo for $100, set up a Shopify site and you're set. The biggest expense will probably be market fees to sell your stuff locally. \n\nI'd encourage you and your GF to put in $1,000 each or whatever makes sense. Set up the LLC, get an account, business credit card (that you pay off every month). Do all that shit right and if it works, great. If it doesn't, you're fine. And if your relationship implodes, you're both fine. \n\nAlso, you two should have a little book club it'll be cute.

But some don't and others make profitable side-gigs but not real companies.  \n\nYou're getting good feedback. Good feedback is irrelevant. Good sales are what matters. And sales beyond friends. You say local markets - not sure if you mean stores or farmer's markets. But keep those activities up. BUT you have to account for the value of the time for whoever is doing the marketing and sales. And whoever is doing the manufacturing. Pay that person what it would cost to hire a stranger for those jobs. Is there still profit? If not, it's a nice hobby. If there is plow all the profits back into the business - basically more marketing till you've maxed out your manufacturing capacity. Then spend some of that profit on ways to increase capacity a little bit. Then sell more till you max out that additional capacity etc. Keep this up till the profit is more than one of your day job income and you feel confident enough in the future to quit that job. But only one of you. \n\nAt some point you'll have to have an agreement who's going to be in charge of what activities, what decisions, what spending etc. Hash this out and WRITE IT DOWN. It may not be a legal agreement, but writing it will clarify your thinking and preserve your memory of what you agreed to. \n\nI would not put my property at risk at this point. I would not spend savings - unless I was prepared to lose it.",

More useful and less opinion:\n\nStoics would start by separating what’s in your control from what isn’t. You can’t control whether the business succeeds, the market, or your partner’s instincts. What you can control is how much you expose yourself, how clearly you set boundaries, and how you plan for risk.\n\nThink about how much you could lose without upending your life. Be honest about the financial, emotional, and time investment you’re willing to make. Make expectations explicit: who handles what, how profits and losses are shared, and what happens if disagreements arise. Written agreements are better than vague trust.\n\nDon’t let affection or fear of conflict drive your decision. Imagine worst-case scenarios/ If you could endure them and still live according to your values, then the risk is manageable.\n\nConsider starting small. Make a batch, sell locally, or run a pilot without putting your property on the line. Testing the idea in low-stakes conditions is a very Stoic way to see if it’s viable before committing fully.\n\nEpictetus reminds us: don’t demand things go your way, but wish for them to go as they do. Decide on terms that let you sleep at night. If the business fails, it shouldn’t destroy your life or your relationship.\n\nFor further reading, The Obstacle Is the Way by Ryan Holiday is great for handling risk and uncertainty in ventures, and Seneca’s letters on wealth and prudence offer timeless advice on knowing how much to stake and what really matters.",

Had little tangible skills so I started an apprenticeship with a local union at age 30 with the thought of working my way into the office as a PM someday. I now have zero desire to do that...the PM's at my medium-sized company make over 200k+/year but never stop working, and I know that's kind of the industry norm. Figured if I'm going to work all the time, might as well work for myself instead of making someone else rich.\n\nI'm now 32 and diversifying my skillsets with the intention to start my own business totally unrelated to construction. Best case scenario, by the time I finish my apprenticeship I will have a successful/growing business on the side that I can turn into a full-time gig. \n\nWorst case scenario, the business doesn't take off like I hoped but I'll still be a union journeyman making decent money. I'll make a living while I figure out my next adventure. \n\nI know you didn't ask for advice, but since we come from similar backgrounds and are the same age I feel compelled to share something I've been struggling/realizing lately: Reading self-help books is good but it will never replace actually doing \"the thing\", know what I mean? Those books make us feel good and artificially better for reading them, but they mean nothing if we don't practice their teachings. Don't get caught in that trap like I did. \n\nGood luck brother.",

You have to decide what you want to look like in 6 months, 1 year and 5 years, use a solid, well-known system and do the work EVERY DAY. It's hard work starting a business; it's like pushing a boulder up a hill on your own. No one wants to help until you get to the top. I kept trying to cut corners, but when I stopped doing that and just worked hard and put myself out of my comfort zone, I succeeded. \n\nHandyman business sounds credible and doable. It's also something you can build to a great size if you think big. Easy to start. Start with cards and local ads; do it in your spare time, and charge the rate you will need next year when you're paying someone else to do the job, too.

There's a lot of money to be made doing things others don't want to do. Many property maintenance companies make more money than the property owners. Many plumbers make more than the home owner they service. Tons of people making 60k a year pay 300 once or twice a year to get their car detailed. And so on. If your not afrain of the physical work, then stick with it but on your own terms.

You make 60k to 80k. You have savings. You have investments. You have retirement money. Most people your age have none of that and are deep in debt. You are doing better than average even if it does not feel like it.\n\nAlso, construction is not a weakness. It is proof you can work, show up, and deal with hard days. That matters way more than a degree when you start something on your own.\n\nAbout the ideas. You are thinking in the right direction, but you need to focus.\n\nProperty maintenance is practical. That is a real skill with real demand. That is something you can turn into money fast because you already understand the work. That is where I would start.\n\nMobile games, music, ebooks are fine ideas, but they are long shots. They need marketing, patience, and usually a lot of failed attempts. They are not bad, but they should be side bets, not the main plan.\n\nThe biggest thing I see is this. You are trying to fix your life by reading, instead of by doing. Reading is good. Learning is good. But at some point you need action, even messy action.\n\nYou do not need more self help books. You need one simple plan and execution.\n\nExample. Niche down. Pick one thing you can sell now. Property maintenance for landlords. Or small commercial buildings. Or busy homeowners who do not want to deal with repairs. Who is your target audience?\n\nThen do boring stuff. Simple website. Google Business profile. Ask past contacts for referrals. Charge fair prices. Do good work. Reinvest profits.\n\nThat alone can change your income within a year.\n\nThe people who really fail are the ones who never try because they think they are too old or not smart enough. You are already past that stage because you are asking questions and taking action.\n\n32 is not late. It is early for someone who finally knows they want more.\n\nYou are not inadequate. You are just at the starting line.",

The fact that you are reading daily, thinking in terms of skills and ideas, and already investing puts you ahead of many people who look “established” on the surface.\n\nI did not come from a strong educational background either. I learned most things by doing, failing, and restarting. I have had businesses that worked, then collapsed completely. At one point I went back to zero financially. What kept me moving was not some big breakthrough idea, but stacking skills that could transfer across industries.\n\nOne thing I would suggest is to focus less on hit or miss ideas at the beginning and more on skills that directly tie to cash flow. Property maintenance is a great example because it solves a real problem and people pay for that consistently. Once you have steady income, experimenting with games, music, or ebooks becomes way less stressful.\n\nI work in video editing, social media management, and media buying, and one thing I see constantly is that businesses do not need genius ideas. They need people who can execute, communicate, and stay consistent. Those are learnable skills, not things tied to formal education. I learned most of it online, through practice and working with small business owners.\n\nAlso, do not underestimate your construction background. It already gives you discipline, problem solving, and work ethic. You are not starting from scratch, you are pivoting.\n\nMany people who “made it” later did not have a straight path. They just kept moving, learning, and adjusting. If you keep building practical skills and stay patient, things do compound, even if it does not feel like it year to year.\n\nYou are not late. You are just early in the part where it feels messy and uncertain.",

For context, I am now nearly 50, and own &amp; operate two businesses; one of which is a handyman/remodeling business. \n\nI am still the key driver in each business, so I have a good ways to go; given that the goal is to build something that can function for weeks or months at a time without me around. I currently own my own jobs, and am not yet officially a \"business owner\" or \"entrepreneur\". I like to think that I'm on the right path, but have not \"made it\" yet. \n\nSo I've been toiling away for 18 years on this, so far. I've made some insanely big mistakes, that set back my progress in some significant ways. But I've also had some good fortune and not-so-bad decisions.\n\nMy short take on it: you have *plenty* of time to create huge success. And given your work experience and financial savings, you are better positioned than I was at your age. Time is definitely on your side. \n\nTo use the poker analogy: it sounds like you have a very good hand. Not an AMAZING hand, but a very good hand. If you play that hand super well, you could crush it. If you play the had moderately well, then you'll do pretty good. And if you play it poorly... well, you know.  \n\nAre you listening to the Contractor Evolution podcast? That's a good one, in my opinion, if property maintenance is definitely the direction that you want to go. \n\nAnother thought on property maintenance: you'll need to decide on whether you want to be self employed and doing the work yourself, or if you want to be running a business with employees. I've known a lot of self employed contractors that are doing far better financially than the small business owners. In my observation, there is a lot of success to be realized for the independent operator as well as the mid-to-large business owner; but the grey area in between... the small business owner... often struggles. That's because having a couple company trucks and employees requires a lot of time, energy, and money, and the profit margin on only having a couple of employees is barely enough to make it viable. So to make that business model a success, you have to get past that tipping point. \n\nAll of that is to say: being an independent owner/operator is a completely different paradigm from owning a business that has an office manager, service technicians, trucks, warehouse/office space, etc, etc. Both options can be financially successful, but they require vastly different skillsets, and you need to decide for yourself which option you want for yourself.",

      "selftext": "Used to say yes to every \"quick coffee\" or \"pick your brain\" request. Felt good. I was helpful. Building karma. Being a good guy. After 500+ free consultations over 5 years, I realized something uncomfortable:\n\n90% never implemented anything. 5% implemented poorly then blamed my advice when it didn't work. 5% succeeded but never mentioned where they got the idea. The math: roughly 500 hours × €100/hour opportunity cost = €50,000 in free consulting.\n\nReturn on investment: 0 referrals, 0 clients, 0 equity, 0 thank-yous.\n\nSo I changed approach: \"Happy to help. My consulting rate is €150/hour. First 15 minutes free to see if I can actually add value.\"\n\nWhat happened surprised me: The time-wasters disappeared immediately. The serious people paid gladly and showed up prepared. The advice I gave was sharper because I had skin in the game. Implementation rate went from \\~10% to 80%+ because paying creates commitment.\n\nUncomfortable truth I learned: Free advice often helps your ego more than the recipient. When people have even €50 invested, they actually listen and execute instead of just collecting opinions. But suggesting this feels \"greedy\" so most of us keep bleeding time into conversations that go nowhere.\n\nFor those running service businesses: how do you handle the constant \"can I pick your brain\" requests without either burning out or feeling like an asshole?",

The whole performative productivity thing. And I was miserable and the business wasn't even growing that fast.\n\nThe breaking point was a Thursday afternoon when I sat at my desk for 3 hours and literally couldn't make myself do anything. Just stared at the screen. Brain completely empty. I thought something was medically wrong with me.\n\nTalked to a therapist. She asked me what I did for fun. I couldn't answer. Asked me when I last took a day completely off. Couldn't remember. Asked me if I actually enjoyed running this business. I started crying which was embarrassing but also clarifying.\n\nHere's the thing nobody tells you. Productivity systems are designed for people who aren't working enough. If you're already working too much, optimizing your work just means you burn out more efficiently.\n\nWhat actually helped was cutting my hours. Not optimizing them. Cutting them. I went from 70 to 45. Felt terrifying at first. Felt like I was abandoning the business. But the business didn't notice. Revenue kept growing at roughly the same rate. Some things just didn't get done and turns out they didn't need to get done.\n\nThe 25 hours I got back went to sleep, exercise, seeing friends, and just existing as a human. My actual productive output during the 45 hours is now higher than it was during the 70. I can think clearly again. I can make decisions. I don't dread Monday anymore.\n\nMore hours isn't more output. It's just more hours.\n\nAnyone else been through something similar?",

Everyone knows he's a great artist, but nobody understands what makes him great it is not his paintings or sculptures. It is multidisciplanary mindset. He created infinite stuff from gadgets to fine art to papers, to business ideas. He had to learn all that by actually studying and experimenting. There were a lot of great fine artists, maybe even better than him at that time, but what made him an artist, is that he surpased them by knowing how to present himself, how to convince investors and the church and the government to give him land, how to manage resources, workers (who actually did all the work while he directed), and how to raise money. \n\nPeople just see the results and say, oh he's an artist cause he did this, without even analogizing the xyz factors that enabled him to do this. \n\nAn artist, or an entrepreneur is anyone who pushes the limits of what's possible in their domain. A banker can be an artist, a killer even can be an artist, no matter how unorthodox it sounds, or a tennis player, a developer, or an entrepreneur. Paradoxically self proclaimed artists are far from artists. they are more like hobyists, that have no need to exxplore the unknown, or try hard to change the status quo in their domain. (some) entrepreneurs do. These are for me the real entrepreneurs / artists that manage to actually do what they envision no matter the path.",

I could buy them for 25cents as long as I spent $60 on them 😂 \n\nSo to me this was a no brainer. Except I had to \"borrow\" my mom's credit card. So I wrote out a plan on a piece of paper to figure out how many I needed to sell to pay her back before the next credit card bill. Calculated with shipping.\n\nObviously I got caught, the whole thing was a disaster. Turns out you can only sell so many of them until the same kids get board and the state decides you're selling fireworks.\n\nI managed to make back $50 in a little less than 2 weeks if memory serves me correct. \n\nMy dad yelled at me because he thought I wanted to play with the snap rocks and the money was secondary. But then I started yelling at him because as much as I wanted to play with them, to me they were valuable merchandise and a means to an end (I can't for the life of me remember what I was trying to get enough money to do just trust me, it was probably something I my parents would have been right to say no to)\n\nBut his accusation made me emotional because it underlined the pain of sacrificing for something that didn't work out and how unfair it was that I don't even get recognition for my discipline. When I was in middle school half of all I wanted was recognition and the other half was freedom. \n\nSo I'm in my room crying like a baby and my dad eventually is kinda like dude, the state dropped the charges (I shit you not), you're not kicked out of school, I didn't even ground you... What are you so upset about? (God bless my parents 😂) \n\nAnd I told him, I wanted to sell the stuff to get an Xbox (which was a lie but... Close enough) and he started telling me about all these businesses he tried starting with his friends. And all the issues they ran into between getting molds for products or certifications to make specific claims or having enough money for different rounds of testing and then trying to convince an investor to give him more money when they blew through it. By the end of that conversation. I realized this is what I was going to be good at one day. I loved learning about things, breaking them down to steps, business plans. The fact it's kinda like gambling but not really. I was a bit of a lonely kid so just the emotional stimulation alone had me hooked. \n\nI think being an entrepreneur is less of a skillset, not so much a state of mind, it's an alignment of interests with a compatible perspective.",

Business is simply how we use it to make money ;).",

Here's mine:\n\nIt took me until about 19 to call myself an entrepreneur (I didn't like the term before that for some reason), but then upon reflection I realized that I've been entrepreneuring my entire life instinctually.\n\nWhen I was 7 years old, all I wanted for Christmas/Chanukah (half-half family over here) was a cash register. Not sure if that's indicative of being an entrepreneur or because one half of my family celebrates Chanukah. That said, I ended up starting a \"video game business\" in my household where I took all my brother's xbox games, wrapped &amp; sorted them, then pretended to sell them to my parents.\n\nWhen I was 11 years old I was starting Minecraft servers and building out role structures, interviewing people to be moderators, setting up Discord channels, advertising the server on directories, working with players to improve their experience.\n\nAt 12, I started dog walking. About a year in, I hired all my friends to be dog walkers and turned it into a small business in our neighborhood where I got the new clients, earned a percentage of the walk, and managed the walking schedules.\n\nFrom 14-17, I worked at some companies doing customer service / other internships, and no matter what, I could not find myself being comfortable staying in one role for more than a couple months. I needed to create some kind of initiative at the company, move up, or learn something new.\n\nWhen I turned 18, I decided to start my own SEO consultancy and have since turned that into a creative + SEO agency (and I acquiesced to calling myself an entrepreneur).\n\nAll throughout those ages, I was creating new clubs at each school level (middle, high, college) and doing whatever I could to innovate what they offered. In high school, it was creating new arts organizations + initiatives; in college, it was creating the university's first true experiential arts event organization.\n\nNow I'm 22, graduated college with a degree in theatre/film and am running the agency - it would be impossible for me to live any other way.",

The scam is paying $200/hr for someone who's really just a bookkeeper with a fancy title.\n\nHere's how to separate the two:\n\nWhat you're actually looking for: Someone who can build a cash flow forecast, model out scenarios, help you understand when you'll need capital before you're desperate for it. That's FP&amp;A work. If they can't talk about 13-week cash flow models or explain what your runway looks like under different growth scenarios, they're not a CFO.\n\nRed flags:\n\n* They only talk about \"cleaning up your books\" (that's bookkeeping)\n* No process for regular forecasting or financial planning\n* Can't explain how they've helped similar-stage companies\n* Want a huge retainer upfront with vague deliverables\n\nWhere to actually find them:\n\n* LinkedIn, but search \"fractional CFO\" + your industry specifically\n* Ask other founders at your stage, warm intros beat cold outreach every time\n* Local accounting firms sometimes have CFO-level people doing advisory work\n* SCORE mentors can point you toward legit people in your market\n\nThe Upwork ghosting thing is real. Most good fractional CFOs aren't hunting for gigs on Upwork, they're getting referrals.\n\nWhat's \"starting to make actual money\" mean in numbers? Like $300K? $800K? $1.5M? The answer changes what level of CFO you actually need, and whether you need full FP&amp;A or just someone to build you a cash flow system you can run yourself.",

They see who actually delivers versus who just talks. Established fractional CFO firms also tend to be more reliable because they have process, oversight, and reputational risk. You pay more, but you’re buying reduced downside.\n\nOn pricing, $200 per hour isn’t a scam signal, it’s closer to market for someone who actually understands cash flow, forecasting, and decision support. The red flag is someone cheap who claims they can “do everything,” or someone who jumps straight into dashboards without first understanding how money actually moves through your business.\n\nBefore hiring, ask very specific questions: what metrics they focus on at your stage, how they’ve helped companies avoid cash crunches, and what decisions they’ve influenced, not just reports they’ve built. A short paid trial or project-based engagement is also reasonable before committing longer term.\n\nIf you’re early and mainly need cash clarity, sometimes a strong FP&amp;A consultant or experienced controller is a better first step than a full fractional CFO title. Titles matter less than whether they can help you make better decisions with the cash you already have.",

Depending on your business this can be easy or tough. Then do the same for your receivables (again when due not invoiced). You now have the bare bones of a cash flow forecast if you join these together. The first thing I spot every time I do this is the payables being paid early because the terms aren't entered right.\n\nGood luck!",

Real ones.  \nThe kind where you spend months building, launching, and nothing happens, not even a single customer.\n\nOne thought kept coming back: **I didn’t fail because I was careless. I failed because I focused on the wrong certainty.**\n\nI’m a backend engineer with 10+ years of experience. So naturally, whenever I started something new, I focused on the technical part. Architecture. Clean systems. Edge cases.  \nIt felt productive, it felt safe, and that’s exactly why it became a problem.\n\nAcross those five attempts, the assumptions that hurt me the most were never technical. They were the ones I kept postponing because they were uncomfortable and unclear.\n\nThings like:\n\n* Will anyone actually care enough to pay for this?\n* Do people know this problem exists?\n* Am I building something people are already looking for?\n\nEach time, I told myself I’d test those later. After the product was “good enough”, after I felt confident, but later never really came.\n\nSo the hardest lesson for me wasn’t “build faster” or “market better”. It was this:\n\n**If you delay testing the riskiest assumptions, you’re not reducing risk. You’re just hiding from it.**\n\nWhat surprised me most is how easy it is to hide not from others, but from myself.  \nAs an experienced developer, the technical work felt safe and familiar. It gave me certainty, just not the kind a business needs.\n\nI’m still building. Just differently now.

Do you even know anyone that is an inventor that lives off the money they make from inventing shit?Have you ever met anyone?\n\nOkay, so let's focus on things that already exist.You don't have to come up with a unicorn idea.You have to find value to bring to the marketplace.\n\nI own a company in commercial truck parts manufacturing and sales. I found a niche of parts, and sub divided it into a sub niche of 7 items with 28 configurations. I don't know shit about trucks or truck parts or any of that stuff, but I know all the stuff that you don't know. I just like that stuff, and I like business. You could say that i'm really good at it.\n\n The truck parts just happen to be the industry I worked in at the time. I find that if you seek your niche in the industry that you're currently working in, you have a higher possibility of finding it within months to a couple years of searching and researching. When you work at a job, you have insight to the industry and the behind the scenes stuff that the average person just doesn't whether it be in a restaurant or a law firm or a construction company. When I researched my part, I called the name on the bag. I also found out there was one other manufacturer. They are both made in america.... For every truck on the planet. They were the only two manufacturers. I worked at a diesel shop. So when I called them asking about pricing, they asked, how much a month we use, and eventually push me to a distributor. That actually gave me a list of all their distributors. I then called those distributors and got pricing. A week later, I called back the manufacturers to set up the diesel shop as a distributor. This gave us their distributor costs. So now I knew what wholesale and retail prices were. I understood.The volumes required to be a distributor from the manufacturers. And I had an idea of how many parts were sold per year.Based on all of that information. I was also able to get the purchasing people at a couple other parts distributors to call\nand go through the same process to verify my information.\n\nI double checked the manufacturing to make sure they were not importing them. Import Yeti is free to use.\n\nI have google so I could do some basic searches to figure out how many commercial trucks are on the road. I worked in a commercial truck repair shop that did the repairs that utilized these parts so I was able to find out how often trucks have to have these repairs made. I was able to find out that this part has not changed in design since trucks were invented. I also found out that the seven that I chose out of hundreds were the universal components that fit a majority of the trucks. They're also required. Their non safety facing, so I don't have to worry about anyone dying. I sent some of them off to a lab to have mass spectrometer materials composition testing and made prints of each. \n\nI utilized import yeti to identify factory clusters in China, India, and Mexico that manufacturer's similar items.\n\nSteel, Zinc parts with strict tolerances, stamped, machined, cast, and plated.\n\nAfter researching factories, I understood what I was looking for in my own factories.\n\nMaterials, processes, in-house tooling and die making, QC testing capabilities, certifications, 3d printing, and packaging/labeling in-house.\n\nI found three factories in china that I reached out to via email. I also found a factory in taiwan that I used for my initial orders. Over the years, i've expanded to 9 countries now including the USA.\n\nI stored everything underneath my camper in a crate pallet or tupperware, totes with a blue tarp over it. Eventually I got a small self storage unit next to the rv park lived in. Eventually, we bought a home and used the two car garage as our primary warehouse with overflow, going into multiple self storage units locally. I picked packed and shipped everything until year five (2021). Then, I moved ninety percent of everything into a 3pl partner because I don't want to run a daycare and have employees.  \n\nI didn't do any advertising or marketing or online stuff at all.And I still don't. I cold called every single commercial truck repair shop dealership college o e.M in america and a double digit percentage globally, solo over the last 9 (10 years in a couple months).\n\nThe hardest part about my business is not sales or any of that other stuff. It's managing inventory to keep up with sales volumes and cash flow.Because all manufacturing turnaround is about ninety days. If you grow at five hundred percent, you're gonna have to buy fifteen hundred percent worth of inventory.Because the timeline drag, and that's a lot of capital to have to manage and flip with a growing business. You can't have back orders or someone will just go to your competitors that you had to take them away from.",

I’ve always been ambitious, disciplined, and productive, did a lot more than expected for my age and genuinely enjoyed working.\n\nLast year I opened my own office space, but it didn’t work out and I had to shut it down. I’ve accepted that maybe the timing wasn’t right, but ever since then I’ve been stuck.\n\nI have clients and ongoing work, yet I keep delaying everything. I procrastinate constantly, wake up late, smoke up, and can’t focus at all. What scares me is that my bank balance isn’t growing, but instead of panicking and working harder like I used to, I feel oddly numb.\n\nI know I’m operating way below my potential, and that makes me really sad. I feel lazy and just disconnected from my drive. Getting out of bed seems like a task. 15mins work is taking me 3-4 days of procrastination or even more sometimes. So many clients i worked with haven’t paid me for the work because it took me 3 months to send an invoice. I look at girls on instagram and think why isn’t my life as easy as theirs? why do i need to grind so much, i’m tired of being a boss lady. I used to feel incredible when younger girls looked up to me, but now i don’t know. I feel shit. I think marrying a decent guy is an easier option for the time. Sick mentality innit? But thats where the burnout has led me. \n\nHas anyone experienced this after setback or a business failure?\nWhat actually helped you get back into momentum?",

          "body": "Yes. This is very common after a setback. You’re not broken and you’re not lazy.\n\nWhat you’re describing sounds like burnout mixed with grief. Not grief for a person, but for a version of yourself and a future you thought you were building. When the office didn’t work out, something inside you took a hit, even if your brain says “it’s fine, timing was wrong.” Your body didn’t move on at the same speed.\n\nA lot of high performers don’t realize this, but drive doesn’t disappear because you’re weak. It disappears because your nervous system is tired of being in fight mode. So instead of panic, you feel numb. Instead of motivation, you avoid. That’s not a character flaw. That’s your system hitting the brakes.\n\nThe Instagram comparison is also a big clue. When you’re tired and disappointed, your brain starts looking for exits. “Maybe life should be easier. Maybe I don’t want this anymore.” That doesn’t mean you actually want to quit. It means you’re exhausted from carrying the identity of “boss lady” without rest or reward.\n\nA few practical things that actually help people get momentum back.\n\nFirst, stop trying to become your old self again. That person was running on adrenaline and excitement. You don’t rebuild momentum by forcing that. You rebuild it by shrinking the game.\n\nRight now, your only real job is to stabilize. Not grow. Not grind. Stabilize.\n\nSend invoices. That’s it. Not perfect invoices. Not all of them. One or two a day. Money coming in reduces numbness faster than motivation does.\n\nSecond, lower the bar so much it feels almost stupid. Fifteen minutes of work is too big right now. Do five. Set a timer. When it ends, you’re allowed to stop. Momentum comes from finishing, not from effort.\n\nThird, separate “I don’t want to work” from “I don’t want this life.” Burnout lies to you and tells you they’re the same thing. They’re not. You can be tired of how you’re working without being wrong for wanting independence or ambition.\n\nFourth, the smoking and late waking aren’t the cause. They’re coping. If you shame yourself for them, you’ll stay stuck longer. Fixing structure comes after energy comes back, not before.\n\nAnd lastly, about the marriage thought. That’s not a sick mentality. It’s a tired one. When people are overwhelmed, they fantasize about safety. That doesn’t mean you should act on it. It just means you need rest and support, not another identity to perform.\n\nMany people who’ve built things hit this exact wall in their mid 20s. Especially women carrying both ambition and expectations. The ones who recover don’t “push through.” They slow down, clean up basics, and let confidence rebuild quietly.\n\nYou don’t need to become a different person. You need to heal the part of you that feels like it failed.",

I could be wrong - I'm going off the only info I have.\n\nComparing yourself to \"other girls on Instagram\" is a losing proposition and I think you know that.  And, yes, we all feel like this after a setback.  It's normal and it's actually healthy to be in a stage of self reflection...but don't stay there for too long because it becomes comfortable and safe.\n\nIt could also be depression, which can be debilitating.  Since you recognized it's a problem, you should seriously consider seeing a mental health professional and one who is capable of diagnosing and prescribing, if necessary. \n\nFor a young person, you seem to have a high level of self-awareness so, kudos to that!\n\nBest of luck!",

Reddit can be good, but if you can invest a couple hundred into coaching/mentorship of some sort you can usually see a huge ROI.\n\nFor me as someone who works in this space it seems like this \"setback\" (more like a lesson) has either caused some sort of mental limitation you are perceiving and you might be dealing with some sort of imposter syndrome or limiting beliefs which are holding you back.\n\nYou need to stop getting your motivation extrinsically and instead wake up and do things which energize you and things you enjoy that keep you creative while making your work more enjoyable. If you focus on doing these you'll almost certainly stop the procrastination and panic mode because you'll be focused on creating and it'll be your pride and pleasure. Of course this is just a judgement with the very limited info we have here, it could also be something completely different.\n\nAgain, its best to speak to someone who has actually dealt with this stuff before, i don't mind listening to you more and giving you a better judgement, either ways please take care of yourself first, i know its not easy, but this too will pass, don't worry :)",

The thought of opening my CRM or sending an invoice would make me want to hide. But then the guilt from not doing it made everything worse.\n\nThe turning point for me was when I realized I didn't have to do everything myself, especially not the boring stuff that was contributing to my burnout. I got an AI assistant that could handle the invoicing, follow-ups, scheduling - basically all the tasks I was avoiding.\n\nSuddenly I wasn't drowning in admin work anymore, and I could focus on the parts of my business that actually excited me again. The creative stuff, the client work, the strategy - not the endless paperwork.\n\nIt sounds like you're dealing with the same thing where simple tasks feel massive. Have you considered automating some of the admin work that's piling up? Sometimes just clearing that backlog can give you space to rediscover why you loved your business in the first place.\n\nThe drive comes back, but sometimes you need to remove the obstacles first.

          "body": "It sounds like your brain, body, and system are “flooded.” So it’s no surprise that everything feels like procrastination or a no right now.\n\nYou’re definitely not alone. This happens frequently for entrepreneurs and small business owners. Add being an ambitious person, the impatience that usually comes with being in your 20s, and the comparison trap of social media, and it’s a recipe for judging, berating yourself and feeling like you can’t figure it out. The down side of social media is that it’s based on selective sharing, so we don’t see the full spectrum of life experiences and challenges in people’s lives.\n\nAcalem gave some really good advice in his post with regard to breaking tasks and timing down to even smaller chunks. \n\nI think one of the other pieces that I’m sensing is that enough people don’t talk openly about how hard it is to build a business regardless of one’s success level. It takes a lot of work especially if you’re doing it alone or don’t have a community of people who can really empathize with you and get it. Everyday you’re waking up to bring some meaningful contribution to clients, to your community, or to the world, and that requires A LOT from a human being mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually, financially, relationally. \n\nBecause it takes your energy, it also requires lots of rest, recovery, resetting, etc. As a former collegiate athlete, I tell my clients all that time that as a leader or business owner, you have to think about yourself as an elite / Olympic athlete. These athletes are not practicing at 100% everyday. They have higher capacity days and lower capacity days. They also have rest and recovery days built into their programs. They’ve created success structures for themselves so that they can perform optimally and sustainably.\n\nSo as a business owner yourself, aka an elite athlete, I’d encourage you to practice extending some space and grace for yourself so that you can recognize that, maybe at the particular moment in time, you need some time for rest and recovery.\n\nWith regard to picking yourself back up after the setback, take some time to write down what didn’t work and why (if you haven’t already). \n\nWere you trying to do it all yourself? Did you not have the infrastructure in place? Was the space not right for you / too expensive? If you had a team, would it have made a difference? \n\nAs for the grief / burnout recovery, there are lots of good resources for this. Have you done any kind of exploratory / “excavation” work around naming and being with any hard / harsh feelings connected to disappointment? Do you have friends, a therapist, and/or a coach that you could work with to help you move through that type of work?\n\nLast thing, do you ever give yourself time / space / permission to just do nothing so that your mind can unwind and settle? The image of a snow globe comes to mind. When we are full or flooded, it’s like the snow globe that we shake up and watch all the snow flurries settle back down. If we don’t make space for doing nothing, then our brains, bodies, and systems can’t settle and we stay in hyper alert / overdrive. \n\nI hope this helps, and gives you some additional things to think about.",

My only regret is not tinkering with more projects in college - the fact that you're thinking about being an entrepreneur shows that you're ready to do it. You can work on it in small ways while doing classes, like only having 1 or 2 clients - learn how to solve their problems by doing, and once you're graduated and ready to scale a full agency, you already know what to do.  \n  \nThe best entrepreneurs are obsessed with finding &amp; solving problems - if your agency can start with serving a niche of people that have problems with their marketing, and you solve their problems really well, you're in a great spot. And the best way to learn to be an entrepreneur is to BE an entrepreneur - not learn general leadership skills or general marketing concepts from your classes. It's proving to yourself that you know how to make something from 0 to 1, which only happens by doing it. So do projects! Learn outside of your classes!",

So I did digging on that and I know I have to send a specific form out to anyone in the program that I send over a set amount (I believe it's like 500-600 in a year). I've got all of this in my notes at home so no info needed on that, but what would be a good payroll software that would make tracking all of that easier? I'm guessing with anyone being able to be a part of the program I will need to be sending out a lot of forms come end of 2026 &gt;&lt;",

      "selftext": "A close friend of mine runs a sales company. I’ve watched them quietly build this system over the last year, and it produced just under $1M in new ARR in 30 days. Here’s the breakdown of their sales operating system:\n\n\n\n1. Pre-call qualification (this is where most teams bleed time)\n\nThey don’t let everyone book.  \nCalls only get booked if the prospect is a real fit. Qualification happens automatically through:\n\n* Smart inbound routing\n* Short VSL-style videos before booking\n* Website pages that pre-educate the buyer\n* LinkedIn connection automation for long-term nurture\n\nOutcome:  \nClosers talk only to real buyers. Time-wasters are filtered before a human ever gets involved.\n\n\n\n2. Discovery &amp; research (without manual prep)\n\nBefore every call, the rep already knows:\n\n* Funding stage\n* Company size\n* Who the real decision-maker is\n* Strategic initiatives\n* Recent hiring signals\n* Timing indicators\n\nAll of this is auto-aggregated and summarized before the call even happens.   \nSo when the rep joins, they’re already fully briefed, without spending 45 minutes digging.\n\n\n\n3. Follow-up &amp; nurturing (where most revenue is actually won)\n\nMost prospects don’t buy on the first call. Their follow-up stack runs:\n\n* Automated value-driven follow-ups\n* Personalized video follow-ups (not just text spam)\n* Multi-threading across LinkedIn to hit all stakeholders\n\nNo “just checking in.”  \nNo chasing ghosts.   \nNo pipeline rotting.\n\n\n\n4. Why this closed $966K in one month\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, the leverage came from 4 things:\n\n* Only qualified buyers reach closers\n* Prospects arrive educated (less friction, faster decisions)\n* Automation removes admin from the sales cycle\n* Content warms people up before they ever talk to sales\n\n\n\nThat’s how they turned attention into real pipeline, and $966K ARR in 30 days.\n\nIf you were running this system, what would you improve or change first to squeeze out more revenue?",

Getting the first couple clients wasn't easy, but I'm getting more and more, and I'm hoping it ramps up even more the start of next year.

To get to $20K/month you'd need to either charge way more (hard market for that) or work way more hours (defeats the point of leaving your job).\n\nThe \"you'll never be wealthy as an employee\" thing is mostly BS.

Media companies especially are brutal margins.\n\nKeep doing it as a side hustle. If you can get to $10K/month consistently while keeping your day job, then maybe consider it. But jumping now with $3K/month and a family depending on you is risky for not much upside.\n\nBeing a good role model for your kid isn't about owning a business.

If you can save up at least 6 months to a year of expenses to cover the bills and things and a buffer so you aren't stressed about handling your immediate expenses and can grow your business to the point you're bringing in money comfortably. \n\nI'll just say I know you might have brought 3k in gross revenue but have you worked out your numbers? Do you know your costs, things like taxes, general liability insurance, cameras, digital storage costs, any editing software subscriptions, car maintenance, etc worked out and have income being split up to cover that stuff  before you taking a paycheck.

      "selftext": "I started this team not too long ago and we’re still small, just nine people. At first, I felt like managing others was pulling me away from actually doing the work, so I tried to get more disciplined about it. I read up on management, borrowed parts of the systems I’d seen at my previous company, and adapted them to fit our size, hoping that a bit more structure would make things feel under control.\n\nBut as the number of projects keeps growing, I’ve started to realize that the chaos isn’t just coming from team management. A lot of it is my own project management and work habits. My days are full of short meetings, Slack notifications, quick syncs, consulting calls, client updates, and random “can we jump on a call right now?”. None of these things are useless on their own, but together they completely shatter my focus.\n\nWhat really shook me was a day last week when I had seven meetings, all under 30 minutes. By the end of the day, I was exhausted, but when I tried to look back and figure out what we had actually decided, everything felt blurry. I knew I had agreed to things, but without digging through messages and notes, I couldn’t clearly remember the reasons, who owned what, or the ddl. There are just too many decisions happening every day, and it feels like my brain can’t keep up with my calendar anymore. The more tired I get, the worse my efficiency becomes.\n\nSo I wanted to ask leaders who’ve been doing this longer than I have, how do you turn all this incoming information into a system that actually works for you? How do you make sure important things don’t fall through the cracks when your work is so fragmented? I feel like I’m constantly missing things, and I’m hoping to learn how others deal with this before it burns me out completely.",

          "body": "You are definitely not alone in this. What you are describing is less about workload and more about cognitive overload. When decisions, context, and follow ups are scattered across meetings, Slack, notes, and emails, your brain becomes the system of record. That is what burns people out fast.\n\nOne thing that helped me a lot was separating “thinking” work from “capturing” work. Every meeting, call, or sync needs a single place where decisions, owners, and next steps are written down immediately. Not perfect notes, just outcomes. If it is not written, it does not exist. Over time, this alone reduces the mental load because you stop trying to remember everything.\n\nAnother big shift is limiting where work can show up. Slack, meetings, and quick calls feel harmless individually, but together they destroy focus. I started pushing everything into a small number of async updates and weekly checkpoints. Fewer meetings, but with clear agendas and clear outputs. If a meeting does not end with decisions and owners, it was not worth having.\n\nIt also helps to move from managing tasks to managing decisions. Tasks change constantly, but decisions are what actually matter. I keep a simple decision log that answers three questions: what was decided, why, and who owns the follow up. When things get blurry later, I do not have to reconstruct history from messages.\n\nFinally, give yourself permission to slow the input. Growth often adds chaos faster than systems can handle. It is okay to pause new projects, say not yet, or batch decisions. Efficiency does not come from doing more, it comes from reducing the number of things competing for attention.\n\nBurnout usually shows up when your system no longer matches the complexity of your role. Fixing the system is not a personal failure, it is leadership work.",

Improving the product or service. Getting traffic. Following up with people who already showed interest. That’s it. Everything else is support work.\n\nI also cap my focus. One main goal per quarter. One main task per day. If I try to do five “important” things in a day, nothing really moves. If I do one boring but high impact thing, progress shows up.\n\nAnother rule that helps. Urgent does not mean important. Emails, DMs, tiny tweaks, tools, planning, learning more. They feel urgent because they are easy. Real growth usually feels uncomfortable and slow.\n\nIf something keeps coming up but never clearly helps growth, I ignore it without guilt.

LLMs don’t magically invent answers, they remix what they already trust. If you’re not part of that ecosystem, you won’t show up.\n\nThe big change is you can’t rely only on “ranking a page” anymore. You have to understand where AI systems are pulling information from and why certain brands get mentioned repeatedly. That’s pushed me to focus more on being present on the pages and publications AI models already cite, not just optimizing my own site.\n\nI still treat SEO as the foundation, but now I also track which queries trigger AI answers, where competitors are being mentioned, and which sources keep showing up. Tools that give visibility into AI mentions and citations help connect the dots so you’re not guessing and help in quick execution.\n\nSo it’s less 'AI replaces Google' and more 'discovery gets redistributed.'

My advice is two fold:\n\n1. if you can find a way to protect it (patent, trademarks, anything legally enforceable), then do it. Full stop. Even if they steal it and takes you years to get paid/justice, its better than losing everything AND not getting anything for it. \n\n2. If you can't protect it, then find a way to improve the product or your marketing/positioning. theyre a huge conglomerate and presumably late to the space and have to update any manufacturing/marketing/legal/ other large corporate shenanigans. use that time to get ahead and build your moat/customers. flood the market (assuming its a profitable product/market) and get those sales before they do. if they are a billion dollar company itll be like moving those big shipping container ships, its gonna take some time. use that to your advantage. who knows if you flood the market and the product is great they may even buy you out even if they have their own product in the pipeline. if the buyer is a product guy, he still has to convince his management, and the chain of command, etc. Meeting after meeting after meeting, just to agree then finally source, design, test, manufacture, etc.",

After receiving it, I had some first-impression concerns and reached out to the company to talk through them and possibly return it.\n\nInstead of troubleshooting or pushing back at all, they immediately refunded me in full and told me to keep the unit. No discussion. Just “refund processed, you don’t need to send it back.”\n\nHere’s the unexpected part: after actually using it under real workload, the thing is phenomenal. Faster dry times, insane airflow, doesn’t bog down under resistance. It’s objectively better than some legacy brands I’ve used for years and clearly a serious professional tool with solid internals.\n\nAnother detail: this was the last unit they had available directly. All distributors I checked are quoting 5 to 6 week lead times on new stock.\n\nSo now I’m sitting here with a $760 piece of equipment that I didn’t pay for, is actively improving my day-to-day operations, and would easily pay for itself many times over. I didn’t ask for a comp, didn’t threaten a chargeback, didn’t exaggerate issues. I genuinely just wanted to talk through concerns and possibly return it.\n\nAs a small business owner myself, the whole situation feels… weird. Objectively, it’s a win. But it also feels morally awkward because that wasn’t my intent, and I know what margins can look like for smaller manufacturers.\n\nHas anyone else had something like this happen where the outcome is great, but it still feels uncomfortable? Or is this just one of those “accept the good luck and move on” situations?",

And mention it to every dog groomer. Spend $750 in ‘marketing labour’ doing this if you don’t have the money to spend \n3. Advertise using this product socially, how great it is, how you asked a question and without saying it was free - explain they communicated excellent with you and offered a ‘warranty’ for a broken item. Basically making it risk free and thus selling more for other people. \n4. Write the fuckin name of this product on here so other people can buy it. \n5. Explain what happened socially, giving praise to said business, and offer $750 worth of dog grooming for free to the community, saying they funded it - because they did. \n\nThere is loads of good options.

So we'd do 5 + 3 instead of 5 + 2. And it's still more advantageous for employers in terms of number of worked days than some current attempts at doing 4 + 3.\n\nIt could make what is now seen as weekend work worth it. So both 5-day and 3-day work weeks would become an option, instead of the vast majority of people being constrained to being busy with work on the exact same 5 days per week.\n\nMaybe it could allow students to have feasible side jobs that are more than just pocket change. Or other weekend jobs that can be more substantial in income than if they were 2 days only so are then worth it. Or, for example, one parent works 5 days, the other 3, instead of one having to stay at home during the week because childcare is too expensive to be worth it. \n\nMany things that are now closed on the weekends could be running 8/8 days if there were 3 days worth of pay available to a separate set of employees. You could then call, say, a plumber on the weekend, because some plumbers would work 5 days, others 3 days. The idea of \"weekend\" would maybe change.\n\nPeople could actually travel to places if their time off was 3 days, as 2 days is often too short to be worth it. Maybe spend some time at their parents' house outside the city. It could make places that at the moment don't have much money flowing in, flourish.\n\nCould have many benefits. And I'm not even mentioning all the mental well-being benefits.",

So really I think it depends on the situation. \n\nThe advice I heard that I think is applicable here is to see if you as the business owner or boss are doing everything *YOU* should be doing to help the employee succeed. Essentially there are 4 things you should be doing. If you are doing all those things and the job is still not getting done, then it's time for them to go.\n\nThe four things you should be doing are ensuring they know what you want them to do, how to do the thing you want them to do, when that thing should be done by, and removing any obstacles that stop them from doing the thing.\n\n##1. What\nHaving a clearly defined role and set of responsibilities. If they don't know  what their role is and the responsibilities that come with it, they'll never be able to perform adequately. Clearly communicate the tasks they are responsible for completing.\n\n##2. How\nOnce they know their duties, confirm they know how to complete the job. For entry and mid level positions, SOPs are how you can give step-by-step instructions without having to constantly be present. For higher level positions that require more advanced or a larger variety of skills, and honestly most small business positions, training takes longer to get them familiar with how *your* business operates, or you're paying them enough to already come on with those skills already developed.\n\n##3. When\nIf they know what to do and how to do it, and it's still not getting done, then confirm they know the timeline. Tell them by when or how often they should be completing tasks. If you've told them once, remind them. You may not need to train them more, just a gentle reminder.\n\n##4. Obstacles\nIf they know what to do, how to do it, and when to have completed it, but it's still not getting done, check to see there isn't something external stopping them. The classic example is telling a chef you want a simple omelette for breakfast this morning and there being no eggs in your house/restaurant. Clearly despite the skills the chef has and the communication of your expectations, they won't be able to do it. Maybe the employee has an issue and they don't feel like they have the authority to \"fix\" the problem. Either fix it for them, go buy the eggs, or give them the authority and guidelines to fix it themselves.\n\nIf you as a business owner aren't making sure that your employees have everything they need to succeed, then you are failing your business in that respect.     \nSure, you may just have a bad hire, but that's also your fault for not vetting properly. Both management and hiring are skills you need to develop though, so it makes sense to suck at first.",

There's an element of whether someone has the potential to succeed, but the truth is that most everything can be trained. Then, you have to decide whether the gap is small enough that you're willing to invest in bridging it. You should account for vacancy costs, hiring costs, and risk of new employee failure in that case. It's pretty high in some fields and VERY high in others (e.g. sales). The greater the complexity of the job, the more you should expect to train for quality and results.\n\nIf you're expecting to hire someone and for them to instantly be plug and play, then you're the problem and you shouldn't be managing people. That's not how it works for 99.9% of the population. Very few people have the tools to set themselves up for success in a new role and/or a new company.\n\nHire and fire for attitudes.

Our BCBS rates are going up to 2400 a month with no pre-existing conditions.  The subsidies have expired.  We didn't renew by the Dec 15 in hopes something would get done in Congress because we can still enroll by Jan 15th.  I just do not understand how Health insurance with huge deductibles can actually cost 2400 for 2 people.  My mother who is 76 and lives with me because she has late stage Alzheimers pays 280 a month with Aetna because she was civil service and Federal government subsidizes her healthcare.  She doesnt get Medicare because she didnt pay enough into it but at 280 a month, she is good.  This entire system is a joke.  I feel like I am being punished or farmed.\n\nMy question is what are some other options?  Maybe just catastrophic insurance and then Primary care use cash.  We are trying to save to retire but with Homeowners insurance going up every year as well as Auto insurance and now this.  Its simply unsustainable.\n\nEdit:\n\nI wanted to add a very weird fact to this all.  One of the many reason i have no trust in insurance companies.  A few years ago Humana pulled out of our county and we had to change insurance providers.  We ask why but in short the reason was they lost money or the zone we live wasnt profitable, blah blah.  The irony when I saw them place 400 piece order with our gift shop later that month.  They obviously are not hurting on money",

Others look at short term plans if your state allows them, they are cheaper but exclude pre existing conditions. Health share plans cost less but they are not insurance and payouts are not guaranteed.

But here is some info:\n\nInsurance companies calculate your premiums according to the following things:\n\n* Your age\n* sex\n* zip code \n* smoker or non smoker\n\nThey use these benchmarks to calculate the risk they are taking by bringing you on board. Your medical conditions don't matter anymore because of you are on an ACA plan. The older you are, the higher the cost. Men are more expensive than women because they have more medical issues the older they get. The insurance companies in the United States exist to make money, so they price everything accordingly. \n\nThe price they come up with for insurance coverage whether you have an ACA plan from the marketplace, a plan from your employer, or even Medicaid and Medicare is the same. The price is the price. \n\nWhat you pay then depends on how much your employer covers, how much the government pays (ACA subsidies or medicaid or medicare). Insurance companies are raising their prices because the cost of healthcare continues to skyrocket and Republicans have decided that they don't want the government to pay for the ACA subsidies anymore, so individuals like your have to pay full price now, which is statistically higher than ever before.\n\nI used to work in insurance and honestly, the catastrophic plans are a scam and really difficult to navigate for someone who is not versed in their exclusions. You could get a private non ACA plan that will look at your medical history to get you approved, that is more affordable than your current plan, but it is not as comprehensive. There's a lot more to explain on how that works, but hopefully you get the gist. \n\nMy recommendation is to just eat the cost and stay fully insured. Being in your 50s with a business and a spouse to worry about, it;s not worth the risk .",

There is a huge gulf between the care a hospital is required to provide you and the care an insurance company will provide you.\n\nMost cancer treatment is not \"the ER has to treat you\" care. And even if a hospital is going to provide you with the bare minimum and bill you/settle later, that may not be enough to give you the best chance of long life or quality of life. There are all kinds of high-ticket items that are technically not *necessary* and you don't get those without insurance.\n\nNeulasta shots to keep white blood cells up during chemo: &gt;$10k EACH (I had four, some people need 20)  \nBreast reconstruction surgery: 6 figures (I'll need at least 2)  \nCDK 4/6 inhibitors to prevent breast cancer recurrence: &gt;$10k/month for 2-3 years  \nPET Scans to check for metastatic spread: $10k\n\nJust a few examples.

Some were clever, some were punitive, some were incentives, they even tried something illegal, until that got shut down. Nothing worked. There was always at least one person late, every single day. And usually 2 or 3, out of staff of about 25. And it was always one or more of the same 8 or so people showing up late. Nothing worked.\n\nFinally, the owner gave up, and quietly approached the half dozen or so of us who were always on time or early, and just asked us to deal with it. For a price. Here, Uncle, here’s a $50 gift card. Hey, a vendor gave me this nice bottle of bourbon, but I don’t drink. You take it. Oh, she needs to leave two hours early today for a doctor’s appointment? We’ll just overlook that and pay her for the entire day. Hey Bob, these widgets aren’t selling, and you mentioned how nice they were. Why don’t you remove them from inventory as a store expense and take them home?\n\nThat was a pretty good system, because the people who were conscientious felt taken care of, and the people who were always late didn’t feel like they were constantly getting in trouble. In fact, it made the late people a little more conscientious, because there wasn’t always someone annoyed at them.

There’s no silver bullet, and this conversation often raises more questions than answers.\n\nThe first thing to look at is the nature of the job. In roles where timing is critical, like childcare, customer facing coverage, or safety related positions, being on time is not optional. If coverage is impacted, then the expectation is clear: being late isn’t acceptable (PERIOD).\n\nOn the other hand, there are roles where output, collaboration, and results matter far more than watching the clock. In many tech and knowledge based jobs, no one is tracking minutes as long as the work gets done and you are not bottleneck.\n\nWhere it gets tricky is fairness and morale. When some employees consistently arrive late while others are dependable and punctual, it can quietly erode trust, even if the actual impact on operations is small. That’s usually the real issue, not the 1–8 minutes themselves.\n\nFor me, the balance is setting clear expectations based on the role, applying them consistently, and addressing patterns early in a respectful, private way, before small issues turn into resentment.",

I could see when a prospect viewed my card multiple times and reached out at the right moment. One of those turned into a $40k contract. We do lots of conventions throughout the year for context.",

Moo is better quality but more expensive so skip them unless you're trying to impress.\n\nDigital cards are honestly underrated and I'd lean that way for most situations now. A simple link in your email signature or a QR code on your phone works for 90% of interactions. With our clients we've noticed physical cards mostly end up in a drawer or trash anyway while a LinkedIn connection actually leads somewhere.\n\nIf you do need physical cards for events or industries where they're expected, Canva has a print service that's cheap and lets you design without paying a designer. Or just order the absolute minimum quantity since your info will probably change within a year anyway.\n\nThe hundred dollar quote from local shops is insane unless they're doing letterpress or some fancy finish.

I had a website, fb business page, LinkedIn, and Houzz, for the 18 years I was in business.  I got  exactly one client off of one of the free platforms. Most of my vendors required a website for opening a reseller account.  So, did I need one, yes. Did it help me get any business, no. I thrived on word of mouth and had very loyal clients that I built relationships with in the 18 years I worked for another company. No I didn't steal any clients. The company closed their doors 4 months after I left, which of course I knew that was coming. \n\nI kept my philosophy  (that I learned, at the age of 21 from a very wise boss, who didn't scoff at me when he asked during my interview where I wanted to be in 5 years and I told him.) of giving the most dependable and knowledgeable service as possible, at the core of my company's mission statement. The clients could get the same products elsewhere but not the same level of service and industry knowledge that I had. I knew I needed to have a niche and there was nothing better than word of mouth. I got clients that were willing to pay for quality, because they saw what I did for others and asked for me. So for b2b, in a small town (pop. 160,000), I definitely did not need a website to get business. All that to say, being distinguished in your field is more important than anything else.\n\nI believe in a much higher population a website would have been useful. I spent way too much money and time on my beautifully visual and professional website. If I knew what I know now, I would just have a one page simple website. Saved some money and a LOT of time. I worked really hard on my website through all 18 years. Really, it was just a money pit. I had to continuously pay more for add-ons and tech support to keep the site running properly.

Social platforms, marketplaces, and referrals can absolutely generate business. So no, a website isn’t strictly necessary to get started.\n\nBut owning a website is like owning your home.\n\nIt requires a greater upfront investment in time, money, and maintenance. In return, you gain control, stability, and long-term value. Most importantly, you gain intelligence. When you own your website, you own the data. You can see who’s visiting, what they care about, how they convert, and where opportunities are being missed. That insight is very difficult to get when you rely solely on rented platforms like social media or third-party marketplaces.\n\nOver time, that intelligence compounds. It allows you to improve messaging and offers, understand customer behavior, optimize marketing spend, and build a durable brand.\n\nSo while a website may not be required for your small business, it is critical for greater success. If your goal is to grow, learn faster than competitors, and build something you truly own, a website becomes foundational.",

My business also runs its booking services and online sales through our POS platform website. So literally our website is just a landing page that mostly redirects visitors to parts of our POS system and has some About Me sections. However it gives us something permanent with a professional email address to put on business cards. I did have Instagram and Facebook business pages but tried giving those up in January in an effort to improve my mental health and getting off social media. Our store sales plummeted within weeks. I then had to begin rebuilding a new Facebook business page.

I am using it the same way small businesses have always used better tools, as a force multiplier that lets me do more with the same amount of time and energy.\n\nAI does not run my business. I do. It helps me draft, research, summarize, sanity check ideas, and move faster through the boring parts so I can spend more time on the work that actually matters. Talking to customers. Making decisions. Building relationships. If anything, it gives me back time to be more human, not less.\n\nThe fear that we will forget how to do things ourselves assumes people blindly outsource their brains. That is a choice, not a requirement. Calculators did not kill math. Spreadsheets did not kill accounting. Email did not kill communication. The people who understand the tool and keep their skills sharp are the ones who benefit. The ones who abdicate responsibility get weaker, and that has always been true with or without AI.\n\nAs for cost and dependency, small businesses already rely on software, platforms, utilities, and vendors every single day. The difference is that AI finally gives small operators leverage that used to require staff or agencies. That is empowering, not dystopian.\n\nIf someone feels overwhelmed by AI hype, the answer is not to reject it outright. The answer is to use it intentionally. AI should make me more capable, not replace me. When used correctly, it is not a crutch. It is a power tool.\n\nA couple of really helpful non-techie books that I like that cover AI are:\n\n“Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI”\n\nhttps://amzn.to/49imjL8\n\n\n“Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future”\n\nhttps://amzn.to/493PobQ",

Real estate agents who actually know their local market and can build trust face-to-face. Property managers who physically inspect units and handle tenant issues in person.\n\nThe irony is that while everyone's worried about AI taking over, the real leverage might be in doubling down on the human, physical, relationship-driven parts of your business.

If you have a team of 15 to 25, who is the lowest paid person who manages the most? Thats the employee you want on your team, not because he takes a beating by doing other workloads that may not be their responsibility but the loyalty of doing that for so long has got to be worth an extra 10 or 20k a year easily.",

Something like 70k + 10-15% will give you at least something to pay bills plus quarterly profit distributions if the company does well. At low 7 figures, assuming a 20% net margin (after payroll and all expenses), you’re looking at maybe $5,000-$7,500 in distributions per quarter. Bumps you to $90-100k all together, more if you can improve margins or revenue, with a potential tax benefit on the distributions, and it ties your compensation to the performance of the firm, which can be a net positive for both sides if managed properly. \n\nJust my two cents.",

Doesn't matter what the gross revenue is, doesn't matter what the net revenue is either. Most people often miss the supply and demand of labor markets and just how integral the owner thinks you are. Nothing is stated about you other than your current position. Do you hold any licenses, certificates, degrees, that make you less replaceable? Do you believe, in the owner's perspective, you are indispensable not because of your chatbot bullets but with your responsiveness, proactivity, the relationships you build? Doesn't matter what you think do they view it that way? If you do not hold any specialized licenses or certifications, if you started looking elsewhere are there jobs available with what you are looking for? And more. The only thing that matters is they pay you minimum wage and treat you in line with labor laws.  The cost of living doesn't matter, the location doesn't matter, random numbers being thrown out without context is ridiculous.\n\nNow, let's assume you don't just do those tasks but you are indispensable. You do all of those tasks and do them better than most people with a similar resume as you. You hustle and have been a driver of the growth. You deal with employee relations and have some level of decision making power and do it all well. You are basically acting as a chief operating officer and an exceptional one. Without you it would crumble. Then the \"avg\" package doesn't apply. If you are integral and basically run the day to day, they should give you a package and treat you in a way you never want to leave, especially if you have other options. They need to realize without you, that work will fall all on them in addition to their business operating responsibilities, be spread out amongst the other employees likely burning them out, or  be completed by someone else, or the other employees, way below your abilities and quality.  They are fools to not have already been doing this if this is truly the case. There is a chance you view yourself as more important than they do or you are fairly replaceable but just going on what you said, they should be compensating you as much as feasible to keep you. That being said, all of those tasks, done in a mediocre manner just make you middle management in retail, easily replaceable. Reflect on your value and request a conversation. If you were my key employee I'd piss myself knowing your value and thinking you were even remotely feeling underpaid/undervalued or considering looking elsewhere. Good luck.",

          "body": "From what I’m seeing, businesses that sit on top of real problems, not hype, will grow the fastest. A few stand out clearly.\n\nAI-enabled services for small and medium businesses will grow quickly. Not flashy AI startups burning cash, but practical automation. Things like customer support, bookings, quoting, finance admin, compliance, marketing, and internal tools. The winners will be the ones that package AI in a simple, trustworthy way and actually save time or money. The big challenge here is trust, data quality, and not overpromising. People are already tired of AI solves everything nonsense.\n\nHealthcare, wellbeing, and ageing-related services are going to explode. Populations are ageing, public healthcare systems are under pressure, and people are more willing to pay privately than ever before. This includes remote monitoring, home care, mental health support, preventative health, and assistive tech. The challenge is regulation, ethics, and delivering real outcomes rather than just apps and subscriptions that don’t move the needle.\n\nCybersecurity and digital trust businesses will grow steadily. As everything moves online and AI makes scams and attacks more convincing, security becomes a non-negotiable cost, not a nice to have. Small businesses are especially vulnerable and under-protected. Growth here will favour firms that simplify security and education, not those that rely on fear. \n\nNiche e-commerce and specialist brands will continue to outperform big generic retailers. People are happy to buy from smaller brands if they feel understood and looked after. This works best where there’s expertise, curation, or a strong story, not just cheaper prices. The challenge is margins, logistics, and not being crushed by ad costs. Community and repeat customers matter more than scale.\n\nEducation and reskilling businesses will grow, especially outside traditional institutions. People know that one career for life is gone. Short, practical learning that leads directly to better income or flexibility will win. This could be technical skills, business skills, or even trades done in smarter ways. The challenge is credibility. Too many courses overpromise and underdeliver, so trust and real-world results are everything.\n\nLocal services that use technology well will quietly do very well. Repair, installation, logistics, home services, and specialist maintenance aren’t going away. Businesses that layer tech, automation, and good customer experience on top of boring but necessary work will be hard to compete with.",

As a franchise expert, I’m constantly looking at these exact trends to see where the \"smart money\" is moving.\n\nIf we look at the next 5–10 years, I see three specific areas that aren't just growing, they're becoming essential:  \n  \nSenior Care &amp; \"Age-in-Place\" Services: With the aging population (Boomers), there is a massive surge in demand for in-home care, senior moving services, and home modifications. It’s a very resilient sector because it’s a necessity, not a luxury.  \nEco-Maintenance &amp; Green Energy: It's no longer just about solar panels. Businesses focusing on EV charging station installation, battery storage, and \"green\" home services (like eco-friendly insulation or HVAC) are going to explode as infrastructure catches up with climate goals.  \nHealth &amp; Personalized Wellness: We’re moving away from \"big box\" gyms toward boutique, specialized health concepts—things like IV hydration, longevity clinics, and tech-enabled mental health services. People are willing to pay a premium for health \"optimization\" rather than just basic fitness.\n\nThe biggest challenge? It’s definitely going to be **labor**. Finding and keeping quality people is the hurdle every business owner faces right now. That’s why systems and automation are so huge, the businesses that win will be the ones that use technology to make their human staff more efficient.\n\nIt’s an exciting time to be building.

I agree with a lot of the points made in this discussion but wanted to ad-in for the sake of affirmation. \n\nI think it is a good thing to have a routine that you can stick to. I don’t kill myself and I tell my staff we are not in a life or death industry. We have work to do but let’s be reasonable. Family always comes first! \n\nI have a to do list for the week and for each day. I get inspired by crossing things off. Sometimes I put things on the list that I know Im going to do anyway or have already done because I get an endorphin rush from viewing my accomplishments. \n\nI only take meetings when it is convenient for me unless there is just no other way, which does not happen very often. \n\nI get up at a reasonable time every day, shower, make coffee, feed the dogs and check my e mails while listening to Buddha flute music or just some reggae mixes. \n\nI take brain breaks and do NYT spelling bee when I get mentally exhausted. \n\nI have turned my social media time into advertising and promoting for my company. I get way more pleasure from that than regular social media. \n\nI take a lunch break, read and take a short nap on days that I can. \n\nI break for dinner in the evening to spend time with my wife. \n\nInstead of working late into the night which is much less productive work time, i make lists for the next day(s). \n\nI keep a document open on my desktop for future plans and ideas to improve my company. \n\nInstead of scrolling when I go to bed I like to just lay there and think and let my mind wander. Sometimes I listen to music while doing so. \n\nI hope that is helpful. Good luck!",

          "body": "I don’t rely on motivation at all. It’s too unreliable, especially when you’re on your own.\n\nAs a solo entrepreneur you have to replace motivation with structure. Fixed work hours, a short daily task list, and a clear definition of what a good day looks like. When the rules are set in advance, you don’t have to feel like working to do the work.\n\nI also separate thinking from doing. I decide what matters when I’m calm, then execute when I’m tired, bored, or doubtful. No re-deciding mid-day. That alone removes a lot of friction.\n\nAnother thing that helped was tying work to consequences. If I don’t do the work, money doesn’t come in. If money doesn’t come in, stress follows. I stopped trying to sugarcoat that reality and used it as fuel.\n\nLoneliness is real in solo work, so I build artificial accountability. Weekly targets, public commitments, or even just sending progress updates to someone I respect. You don’t need a team, you need a mirror.\n\nSome days still feel flat. That doesn’t mean you’re failing. Most real progress happens on days where nothing feels exciting. If you can keep working through those, you’re already ahead.\n\nMotivation is a bonus. Systems are what keep the lights on.",

I was working as a senior user experience designer and she said to me, is there anyway you can get all of this into one app and make it much cheaper. I gave it a try and boom, the birth of the solo-entrepreneur. I could do the User experience work, but then came learning to code, learning to make a backend, learning how to get on the app stores. How to sync data across ios and android. I have been working on this for almost two years now and it's almost done.

Things felt steady and growth was predictable.\n\nThat said, last month and this month have been noticeably slower. I do have enough savings to get by, but the overthinking still kicks in, especially at night. I am continuing to invest in advertising, and I have a strong online presence with good reviews and solid creatives, so the slowdown has been a bit discouraging and confusing.\n\nI am based in Texas, in the U.S., so I am especially curious if others in similar markets are seeing the same thing and how you usually handle slower periods.\n\nAppreciate any insight or shared experiences.

I advertise and bring in new customers but many of my regular customers are spending less now. My year started off very strong, I've got a great product and my key demographic are younger people without children that usually have more discretionary spending. Talking to other vendors, it's that way for everyone from the farmers to the crafters and hot food vendors. My business is a dog bakery. I feel so bad when I see the dogs I know wanting to run over to me but the owners trying to quickly guide them away. Some of them have told me recently they have to watch their spending so they are rationing the treats. I told them to come by and let their dogs get my samples regardless of whether or not they can buy anything. The dogs don't understand keeping a budget. I know they'll buy again when they can. The way things have been going, I'm having to scale back the business to only the weekends and focus on regular work as a web developer and digital marketing - the bakery will just be a hobby business going forward. Fortunately, I am finding some work with digital marketing so I can make it work - this takes the pressure off of the bakery being my sole source of income.

Those are very different signals.   \n  \nA seasonal pause in new demand is common, especially toward year end, and it can feel scary even when the underlying setup hasn't changed.

It used to be that mods were sharp about removing obvious spam and low effort promotion, but lately, it feels like more of it is just getting waved through. I keep seeing blatant review spam posted here, and what makes it worse is that it’s clearly getting fake upvotes and scripted comments to push it to the top.\n\nThis place has been a great resource for me, but allowing this much noise to slip through is a recipe for the community to go from great to worse very quickly. When the feed is cluttered with obvious manipulation, it makes the whole subreddit look unprofessional and eventually drives away the experienced founders who actually provide the best value. I’m curious if the rest of the 1k+ people browsing right now are noticing the same shift or if it’s just me. I’d hate to see us lose the quality that's built here, but it feels like the signal is getting lost in the noise and the moderation needs to be much tighter to protect the sub’s future.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m looking for advice from small convenience store owners or anyone who’s dealt with a similar situation.\n\nMy dad owns a small, family-run convenience store. The entrance is very narrow — only one person can pass through at a time. Recently, a homeless man who appears to be an addict has been repeatedly hanging around the front door and blocking the entrance.\n\nYesterday, the situation escalated badly. When my dad asked him to leave and move away from the entrance, the man refused and stood in the doorway shouting and screaming for about 10 minutes straight. He was making obscene gestures (including repeatedly pointing at his genitals), yelling aggressively, and would not leave despite repeated requests.\n\nAt one point, he appeared to aim toward the window as if he might break it. My dad raised his voice and asked him not to. The man then made explicit death threats, repeatedly gesturing slitting/stabbing motions at his neck and threatening to kill my dad. This continued for several minutes.\n\nTwo passersby eventually stopped and helped by yelling at the man until he finally left. My dad even pretended to call the police at one point, but it had no effect. We have videos of the incident, and it’s honestly disturbing. For context, my dad is in his late 60s, and the business is in West Hollywood blvd, Los Angeles. \n\nWhat’s more concerning is that this wasn’t a one-time event:\n\n\t•\tThe man showed up earlier that morning and again later in the evening\n\n\t•\tOne time, my dad gave him a box of biscuits and asked him to leave, and he did\n\n\t•\tBut later that night, he returned and became aggressive again\n\n\t•\tHe seems to be a regular presence in the area and keeps coming back\n\nTo be clear: this is not about being anti-homeless or refusing help to people in need. The issue is that he repeatedly blocks the entrance, refuses to move or leave, becomes verbally aggressive, and has now made direct violent threats.\n\nMy concern is safety — especially if he comes back and follows through on those threats.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\t•\tWhat is the appropriate course of action in a situation like this- when it becomes threatening?\n\n\t•\tIs calling the police the only realistic option, or are there other steps that help?\n\n\t•\tHow do you handle this in a way that protects the business and the people inside without escalating things?\n\nAny advice or shared experiences would be really appreciated.",

          "body": "The recommendations to call the police are right, but in LA you have to be realistic and know the police may or may not actually help.  Still do this.\n\nMeantime, make your business as unattractive as possible for homeless people.  Do not EVER feed, give drinks or allow them to charge their phones at your business.  You're not being kind, you're establishing that you are their new favorite hangout place.  This is bad.  If you want to be charitable, do that by donating to the shelter or other services that happen away from your store.  Make sure all outside electrical outlets and hose spigots are locked.\n\nWhile you should never, ever physically assault anyone, you can also make the environment less hospitable.  Install an outdoor speaker for music.  Next time someone is hanging out in the doorway blocking it, turn on the music to an uncomfortable level.  Play something annoying.  Your choice - Baby Shark, classical, jazz, whatever you think might be annoying.\n\nMany of the homeless people are paranoid.  Install outdoor cameras even if the cameras are fake or don't record.  Make sure the camera is obvious - a blinking red light is helpful here.  Have signs up that say the area is under video surveillance.  If possible, have a recording you can play when needed.  Something like \"You are being monitored.\"  \n\nKeep the outside and front of your store spotless.  Pick up every speck of trash.  Although it has a subtle effect, people are more inclined to gravitate to the setting where they fit in.  The types of customers you want will feel more comfortable in the clean setting and the types of people you don't want will feel out of place.  \n\nIf this homeless person returns, you may want to hire a security guard temporarily.  You just want to move this person along a few times and break them of the habit of coming to your store.  Encourage them to find other sources of biscuits and shelter.",

I guarantee you they're dealing with the same things. Your dad might be intimidated because he doesn't speak English, so maybe you introduce yourself first. Simple omemade goodies or a small tin of swedish butter cookies from the store can be a great ice breaker, especially this week during Christmas. For you and your dad, aways smiling and simply say Hi to the neighbors is also a great icebreaker. Even if they aren't friendly at first, eventually they'll come around because they'll remember you guys as the smiling neighbors. \n\n* Give your dad a simple script he can use in English to say to the person blocking the door in case they return: \n(From chatgpt again:\n\n“This is private property.\nYou must leave now.”\n\nIf they do not leave or continue yelling:\n“If you do not leave, I will call the police.”\n\nThen stop speaking and make the call if it continues. \n\n📞 Script for calling 911\n“I own a store.\nThere is a man blocking my entrance.\nHe is yelling and being obscene.\nI am afraid.”\n\nIf needed:\n“I do not speak English well. I need an interpreter.”\n\nThat is enough. You do not need details.\n\n📞 Script for LAPD non-emergency (if not violent)\n\n“There is a man refusing to leave my store entrance.\nHe is yelling and disturbing customers.\nThis is private property.”\n\nNumber: 877-275-5273\n\n🧠 Important reminders for the owner\n* Say it once only\n* Stay inside if possible\n* Do not argue\n* Do not touch the person\n* Calling police is the correct action\n~~~~\n\nI hope this helps him! \n\nIf you'd like the chatgpt prompts i used, in glad to share. \n\nI wish you and your dad the best!",

The more DIY prevention you can do the better because calls to the police are just an automated menu maze, being told it’s not an issue unless you’re actually in the act of being physically assaulted, and maybe a cop will show up an hour or two later who will just tell the guy to walk off only for them to return 15 minutes later. \n\n- The 7/11 stores in the area blast classical music to discourage loitering. \n\n- Consider a security guard to handle confrontations. Obviously expensive though. Are there neighboring businesses that would also benefit from security and partner up?\n\n- If and when the cops do arrive let them know the coffee or snacks are free so they are more inclined to make non-call visits through the day. \n\n- Get a security camera. One that chimes perhaps when motion is detected. Consider someway a monitor is visible to the front. It’s the idea you’re being watched and documented that discourages people from loitering or escalating threats.",

If you use them too much, they'll first criticize you for not having adequate camera coverage, then ask why you aren't hiring security, and eventually label your business an attractive nuisance. As we've seen from national coverage, hiring off-duty police as security can have unintended blowbacks when they go too far.

From keeping the flowers healthy, making sure you sell them all because they're so easily perishable.\n\nThere's this flower shop close to my work place run by a middle aged man. He's always very nice and accommodating, and we have little chit chats every now and then.\n\nYesterday, when I was driving past my usual route where his shop is along the way, I saw him, seated in front there and he seemed to be in a bad mood. I got down, greeted him and asked what the problem was and why he seemed to be sulking. He complained how hard it was for customers to come by, especially in this season and how most of the flowers he gets wholesale from a farmer just ended up dying after staying for too long in his shop.\n\nAfter spending some time having a talk with him, I decided to buy a few off his hands. I got three flower bouquets for my wife. I'm not romantic per se. I've never really been in the act of getting my wife flowers, but I'm learning to do so. A shoe rack I ordered from Alibaba early July this year was probably the last gift item I brought home for her, and she was all over it. I am trying to make an effort to increase the frequency and this might be a good place to start from while also helping a struggling business stay afloat. I really need to help my old friend with ideas or solutions to thrive in his flower business. Has anyone encountered similar business issues or has an idea or possible solution?",

Finding your niche is important, and knowing what isn’t profitable or worth doing is just as important. It’s very easy to sink a lot of cash into stock- not just flowers every week (which are perishable and have a limited lifespan), but also specialized hard-goods- and different stock is required for different tasks (ie sympathy work vs wedding work, everyday retail vs event work, etc). Trying to do everything can drain your bank account and lead to burn-out, and it seems counterintuitive to limit your services during slow times, but narrowing offerings can help get cash flow under control.\n\nEdit: many old-school florists are also tied to wire services (FTD, Teleflora, etc), but these services are in it to make a profit for themselves, and often florists end up owing these companies money at the end of each month despite filling orders on their behalf.

Maybe he's just burned out, stressed because of lack of income, he's thinking about retiring, He has no more money and can't keep up, and is experiencing overwhelm.\n\nEvery problem has its own solution. Start asking what's going on? Why this or that? Maybe he just needs a little motivation or a person who knows how to generate leads and traffic for him?\n\nHope that makes sense.\n\nPS: I've had a few flower shops as clients before, and there are plenty of little to no cost solutions to drive traffic if that's what he needs.",

You really need to be paired with other seasonal businesses in one shop so as one operation goes out of season you have the next one coming into season. This is why landscaping companies also offer snow removal so they have some options year round.",

Tag your specific city or neighborhood in every single post and story a lot of people search for local services directly on social now instead of Google. Also try to show your face more. A quick raw behind thescenes video or a simple meet the team post builds way more trust in a small community than a fancy polished ad ever will. Just keep it real and stay consistent.",

          "body": "Quality social posts that speak to your audience. You can go both the organic and paid route, and I recommend doing both. Organic growth takes a lot of consistent posting (more than most people realize). Ensure you include reels/video into the mix as these are the ones that are more likely to get put as suggested content. Paid is an amazing layer to add in. To start out, take your best performing posts and do a boost of them - target a local geo location if this is what you mean by community. I'd also recommend looking at Nextdoor or other local message boards. They too offer ad opportunities. Additionally reach out to other local social media groups and see if they will share information to their communities. Depending on how your business helps their audience, a lot are looking for content to share.",
