I’ve tried flipping things online and didn’t have a whole lot of luck. I guess what I’m looking for is an online side hustle that isn’t a full time commitment that I can do on my own time? I don’t really have too many skills I can make money off of. I’ve considered doing food delivery services but the idea of driving to random people’s houses makes me a little nervous. Any suggestions?

          "body": "My job is market research. Reputable companies should compensate adequately for the time involved but often the survey ends up longer than it should be. Better money is in qualitative research - focus groups (live or online) or individual interviews (usually online). Because we expect you to spend 30-60 minutes or more, compensation can be $100-$200 and it's more fun. \n\nBut - getting those opportunities depends on passing the screener survey, which depending on the client/product category, asks about product use and things like whether you have kids or cats, etc. Ex, if you don't have a cat it's pointless for us to get you in a discussion about your experience with cat food. \n\nThe easiest way to get survey projects (qual or quant) is to:\n\n1. Be in the demographic most companies want to sell to - usually 28-45.\n\n2. Sign up to be on a panel and fill out their forms on demoraphics, product use, lines/dislikes. You'll get more targeted screeners. Lots of research companies have panels and you can be in as many as you like.\n\n3. Participate in one of those apps where you scan your receipts. Often, those are owned by companies like mine who use the data from the receipt uploads to provide real info on sales and demographics to manufacturers and retailers. Data is provided in aggregate and clients aren't allowed to contact panelists. The US now has very strict privacy laws and we have to abide by them or risk a lawsuit that could put us out of business. Our lawyers will only let us work with clients who sign our PII agreements.\n\nThe value of doing this is that if the marketing research company has your verified purchase info the screening isn't as annoying. It's not as much of a fishing expedition to find the right respondents, don't have to send a ton of surveys to people who don't qualify, so you don't waste their time. \n\nBottom line - this is legit but not in any way a regular thing, not even a part-time job. Most companies have rules about how often they will send surveys to the same people because it's not in their interest to burn panelists out or talk to the same 1000 people all the time. \n\n I'm about to retire and if I was a panelist I would not get many survey invites because of my demographic. Also, if you don't consume a lot of stuff, you won't get a lot of survey invites either. The point of market research is to understand how to sell stuff to people who like to buy stuff! \n\nNote - I have never worked in political opinion polling so I don't know how that works or what they pay.",

Some will decline you without even asking you anything and when they are repeated, it can be discouraging. It's all pretty mind numbing. To make matters worse, if you are like me and need stimulation to achieve any real accuracy, you may get banned simply from making some small error. Some survey providers are very picky.

      "selftext": "Roughly 12 months ago I traveled to Asia (Japan and China) for just over two weeks. I had an incredible time and an epiphany I wasn’t expecting. \n\nThis is the most time I have consecutively taken away from work, fully focused on fun and relaxing. I work in sales, six figure deals, grueling hours, but I find it for the most part fulfilling. \n\nWe flew from Japan to China to see my partners family, flight from Tokyo to Shanghai, and then a 3 hour drive. This left me with a ton of time to reflect on the trip so far and also the trip to come. I felt completely overwhelmed by the idea that I want to be able to do this more. I started thinking about ways to make passive income to pay for a trip like this again, but in reality money wasn’t as much of the issue as time was. \n\nI have a job that doesn’t allow me to work remote nor would it be a good idea for me to negotiate a hybrid or remote position at my current company. My job is reliant on being in front of the consumer. So I pivoted and started thinking about what I could possibly do at the same time as my day job, with minimal risk.\n\nAfter traveling in China and returning home with a huge inspiration to break out of my predictable life and really try something new I began brainstorming. I thought about all of the things that I saw in Asia that I didn’t see in the US.\n\nAfter a lot of time compiling ideas I remembered these charging kiosk that were everywhere in China. Scan a QR, portable charger pops out, plug your device in and carry on. We used these a few times when we needed a boost and it was so easy.\n\nInitially I began looking at sourcing a kiosk like I saw from a Chinese company, but that idea faded after confusing product descriptions and huge shipping costs. \n\nI know this exists to an extent in the US, I have seen versions of this product at malls, stadiums, and a few restaurants. Most of these required an individual sign up, leaving your phone at the kiosk, or no where to return it.\n\nI found a US company that created a product that I felt was closest to what I experienced in China. I scheduled a call with a rep to learn more and I was impressed. The rep answered a lot of questions and encouraged me to “act fast” as this was around the time that the tariffs were being introduced.\n\nI bought 10 kiosks that house 10 portable power banks available for rent. \n\nI live in New York City, a place I believe could hugely benefit from an integrated portable phone charging infrastructure. In my head this was like the “Citi bike” of phone charging. \n\nUpon receiving my 10 kiosks I started my outreach to businesses. Again, I currently work in sales so I assumed this was the easy part. I had a pipeline full of leads, I made an excel tracker to monitor my business and I was off to the races.\n\nI sent probably 500 emails and got one reply which I later found out was an AI assistant lmfao. I continued the email outreach but changed my template and introduced some A B testing. I added cold calls to the equation…\n\nIf you have never called a business in Manhattan and tried to pitch something, let me tell you… character building. Anyways I had no luck. So I also incorporated messaging on social media, which surprisingly got the most traction.\n\nHere is the question:\n\nMy rep told me that If I at any point wanted to return the chargers he would buy them back from me.\n\nSo after almost 12 months of trying to make this work should I call it quits? Or am I not trying hard enough?\n\nI certainly assumed this would be easier and that my sales background would make it almost a cake walk but I have been humbled.\n\nI have more ideas on gaining traction in the new year but at the same time I am so sick of failing. \n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

So I now have 2 co-founders (there around my age) and I've given them 20% each and made them in charge of the admin work - so there job is to find tutors and students throughout the year because I won't be able to do that once my school starts as I'm going into my final year. They've done the IB and they are tutors themselves which helps because right now they've been finding students (and we have some potential students) - does anyone know where to find students/tutors I told them to use Reddit/Facebook groups but let me know if you guys have any advice?\n\nNow what's my role. Since school is starting - throughout the year I'm committed to growing the businesses social media accounts - so I'm gonna be posting on Instagram/TikTok because hopefully by the time the school year ends I want like 50k followers. What type of content should I post though? Also as for the study guides/resources part we haven't sold any paid products although we've provided hundreds of free resources for students. Any advice?",

You could set up a simple automation to alert you when someone is looking to tutor or be tutored as well.\n\nAs for social media, there are tons of study accounts out there, @/showmeyournotes, @/malinstudies, and @/thatipadvibe being my favorites.

It was amazing to check on the earnings at the end of each month and realize that I made money doing almost nothing.\n\nOver the years bandwidth sharing apps have become more popular and there have been a lot of different apps launched. I have experimented with several of them and know how hard it is to find the bandwidth sharing apps that \"work\".\n\nSome are fake and will never payout. Others are dangerous and can infect your device. I have learned the hard way how to vet these services and now I launched a website to help people find the best bandwidth sharing apps.\n\n[ShareData.app](http://ShareData.app) is a directory of bandwidth sharing apps classified by reliability. I launched this app out of my dorm room with a few friends who are also passionate about passive income.\n\nEvery month we update the classification based on three criteria:\n\n1. Financial Return\n2. Payout Reliability &amp; App Consistency\n3. Safety, Security, &amp; Risk Mitigation\n\nThe goal is to help find the bandwidth sharing app that pay their users and do not harm your system or use your bandwidth to access any troublesome sites.\n\n**We do not accept any sponsorships nor do we use any advertisements.**\n\nNew bandwidth sharing apps cannot use our platform to advertise themselves and our ranking is based solely on the performance of the bandwidth sharing app.\n\nWe are hoping this community benefits from this directory and welcome any feedback you have about the website!",

      "selftext": "So I have a small YouTube channel about home organization and decluttering, been doing it since like March last year. Making around $400-500 from adsense depending on the month, plus maybe another $150-200 from affiliate stuff. Not huge but pays for groceries.\n\nLike I did a video about organizing under the sink and it got 80k views, that one probably made me $200. But most videos get like 5-10k views.\n\nProblem is I spend like 10-15 hours a week filming and editing and im kinda burned out. My wife keeps saying I should post the same content on tiktok and instagram. She sends me tiktoks of other organization accounts like \"see they're making money, you should do this.\" Shes probably right but I really dont want to film everything twice. Also my youtube videos are like 12-15 minutes and nobody watches that on tiktok.\n\nBeen trying to repurpose content for the past 2 months and its kinda working but also kinda a mess. My workflow is all over the place. Sometimes I use Descript to pull clips, sometimes I just do it manually in CapCut cause Descript crashes a lot. Sometimes I use those AI avatar things for videos where I dont want my face, tried a couple like APOB and HeyGen but not sure if people think its weird. Sometimes I just use stock footage with my voiceover.\n\nSo far after 2 months:\n\n* TikTok: posted maybe 30 videos, got around 2k followers somehow, made like $45 from affiliate links\n* Instagram: posted 25 reels, got maybe 700-800 followers, made $30\n* YouTube Shorts: posted 20, complete waste of time, best one got 400 views\n\nThe annoying part is I still dont know what actually works. Some of my avatar videos do ok on tiktok, some flop completely. My real face videos are hit or miss too. Algorithm makes no sense.\n\nAlso im spending like 5 hours a week just repurposing stuff which defeats the whole purpose of trying to save time. Like yesterday I spent 3 hours trying to export a video and CapCut kept freezing. Almost gave up.\n\nFunny thing is my wife started posting the same content on her own account just using her phone and shes already at 5k followers in like 6 weeks. Meanwhile im here spending hours with all these tools making $45 a month on tiktok. She keeps laughing at me.\n\nNot sure if I should keep doing this or just focus on YouTube and forget the other platforms. Anyone else deal with this?",

You don’t have to shoot anything twice, you just have to edit some clips twice, for your YouTube channel and tiktok etc. you have 2 possible solutions for this rn:\n\n1) your wife handles the short form content: you either give her a copy of the raw footage or she makes clips from your YouTube videos and keeps posting them boosting your ‘business’ while you handle the long form.\n\n2) Hire an editor who edits both videos for you (or just one) And makes them ready to post on different platforms. Thing with shorts, tiktoks etc is it has a completely different editing style and timeline. Hooks, snappy cuts, on screen text etc. This is something I can help with as well if you’d be interested.

Freelancing or small service businesses online, like basic SEO cleanups, customer support, or simple video edits, still pay if you get a couple steady clients. Marketplaces are noisy and you’ll see a lot of ghost jobs and recruiter spam, so build a tiny portfolio and pitch directly. If you just need something steady while you ramp up, wf​haler​t is a simple service that emails vetted remote jobs like data entry or admin work, less junk to wade through. Content and AI stuff can work, but it’s crowded and takes longer than people say.",

Income was not the reason I started this its just the result. What im creating im very passionate about and easily spend 30+ hours a week on it on top of my full time job. \n\nFor content creation at least on youtube. I think that has to be the reason you get into it, passion for something. People can grow quick and make money but generally that doesnt last long term because youll burn out from it. Ive done this daily for over a year now that it is bringing in money, trying to make it a career. \n\nmy suggestion for content creation wasnt a get rich quick comment, but i do think you can be very successful if youre willing to pour yourself into it and dedicate the time",

Most of the noise you see about AI automation and microtasks is garbage designed to keep you poor. Real income is never passive when you start. It is active, painful work. If you want realistic results, you need to ignore the shiny objects.\n\nThe most reliable path is simpler than people admit. You need to sell a product that solves a painful problem. This can be software you promote as an affiliate or a simple digital guide you create. That is it. I wasted years jumping between dropshipping and crypto before realizing that boring businesses pay the best. You don't need a groundbreaking idea. You just need a boring system that works every day.\n\nPick one traffic source and master it. It will feel like you are screaming into the void for the first six months. That is the barrier to entry. Most people quit there. I built my entire income stream by focusing on email collection while everyone else was chasing viral dances. Build an audience, move them to an email list, and sell them something useful.\n\nDo not overcomplicate this. Focus on one thing until it works.

You can run it up and redeem all the profit. If you’re interested, just comment you state and I can check if you qualify for the programs. $0 upfront and 0 risk on your part.\n\nYou can also make cash for your refferals as well.",

      "selftext": "I've been lurking on this sub for a few months now and it genuinely changed how I think about making money on the side. I started out looking for quick ways to make extra cash and ended up building something way more sustainable than I expected. Now I'm sitting at around $1000/month from mainly 2 streams, so I'll share what worked:\n\nThe Main Thing : Canva Creator Program ($600-800/month)  \nI've been uploading FB and IG ad templates to Canva since earlier this year and it's turned into legit royalty income. The cool thing is I don't need to keep uploading to maintain the cashflow, it just compounds over time. All those elements and templates you see in Canva are made by individual creators and we get paid a small percentage based on how much they're used by Pro subscribers. Since I started earlier this year I've been seeing consistent growth month over month.  \nMy process is super simple. I use Meta's Ad Library to see what's working in paid ads right now. You can filter by industry, see what formats are popular, and basically get a masterclass in what converts. Then I take that inspiration and add my own twist to it. Sometimes it's color schemes, sometimes it's layout variations, but the core structure is based on what's already proven to work. I mostly upload ad templates, gradients, and design elements. A lot of it is stuff I make while warming up before actual client work or things I created for projects but didn't sell the IP to.\n\nThe Background Stuff - GPT Apps ($100-200/month)\\[I know it's been said 100 times on the sub alr\\]  \nI saw a post on this sub a few days back about someone using their spare time to do GPT apps and it reminded me that this is something I've been doing too. I replaced my scrolling time with these apps. Like instead of mindlessly going through Instagram or Twitter for 20 minutes, I'll open one of these apps and do surveys or game offers.\n\nI'm pulling around $100-200/month from a mix of survey platforms and game reward apps. Some months are better than others depending on what's available, but it averages out to that range.  \nThe biggest shift for me was understanding the difference between trading time for money and building assets that pay you repeatedly. The Canva stuff is asset building. I make a template once and it earns for years. The reward apps are time trading, but low effort time that I'd waste anyway. If you're just starting out, don't sleep on things that seem small or beneath you. I almost didn't start with reward apps because I thought it was kind of lame. But even $100 is real money and it required basically zero skill to start.  \nAnd if you have any creative skills at all, seriously look into Canva's creator program. The Meta Ad Library trick alone is worth trying, even if you're not uploading to Canva. It's free market research. Anyway, this sub planted a lot of these seeds for me so figured I'd give back.",

Without going into too much detail I focus on a top 20 crypto that  has pretty much stayed in the $12-30 range for the last few years. I have a bot that simply automates sales orders every time the price fluctuates 1.5%. This isn’t enough to replace my day job when you average out the good &amp; bad periods and even if it was I’d probably just divert that income to other investments for the time being but it’s enough that if I suddenly got laid off it would cover my bare minimum under realistic but bad conditions and potentially exceed my day job during short periods of high volatility.\n\nExtremely low effort and surprisingly high ROI but there is a fair amount of fluctuation due to the market plus the risk that it could all go to zero. Also a reasonable but respectable amount of capital is involved (think a year’s worth of salary).\n\n\n\n\nA shocking percent of people in the investing space have very little knowledge of accounting, forecasting, understanding financial ratios, hedging, etc so you could possibly create content to address that gap and get better returns by using “sweat equity” instead of cash to get the ball rolling.\n\nAt the end of the day though you have a few factors you gotta balance: time, capital, risk, and required returns. You can make a ton of money with little risk and little effort if you have a lot of money to start with,  can make a lot of money with little upfront effort if you are willing to lose it all, you can put in a ton of time and build something that will reward you down the road, etc.\n\n\nThere is no such thing as a free lunch so you gotta tweak the inputs to get where you are comfortable but passive income isn’t a myth but you do gotta temper expectations. It’s unrealistic to think that you can replace your day job with zero effort and $1k. But depending on how much effort &amp; capital you are willing to invest you can build a nice revenue stream.",

I pick the underlying stocks following a refining process that I'm still improving:\n\n1. Pick underlying stocks: I wrote a program to screen stocks based on some of my own formula and no earnings coming out before the expiration date (my formula calculates a value similar to IV so higher value implies higher premiums). Or sometimes I just pick the ones I'm more familiar with and repeatedly traded before;\n2. Further refining: Pick those with 1% - 1.5% biweekly premium. (Don't chase higher premiums and avoid pharmacy stocks. I've been bitten by those.)\n3. Then: Look at fundamentals. Select a few with good fundamentals or I'm confident / familiar with its financials.\n4. Next: Review technical charts and find the patterns that I like.\n5. Finally: ask Chatgpt if any meaningful events will happen before the expiration date (for example debt maturity). (Sometimes a future event will make the premium high)\n\nAt this point I'll have 3 - 5 stocks I'll sell CSP.\n\nI close or roll the position if I the stock falls to near or below the striking, or I have 80%+ profit, or the premium for the rest of the days is too low to hold. I very rarely get assigned.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. Don't chase high premiums.\n2. The game is in a way that you can win 10 times, but one loss could wipe most of the gains if not all, so need to be extra cautious with losing positions, epecially when the market is on a downhill where you have higher chance to loss.\n3. I trade in a margin account where my money is fully invested, and I use the margins to secure puts. The good thing is that you are not actually using the brokers money so it is interest free. So if you can boost your total return by a few percent with CSP that is still a win. The bad thing is that you have to be extra cautious with margins. I usually use a margin within 30% of my account value.",

However, I’ve noticed that it’s really hard to find jobs here as a student since most employers prefer college graduates or people with prior work experience. Because of that, I’m looking for realistic ways to earn while studying. Can you guys suggest side hustles, online jobs, or beginner-friendly income ideas that are doable for students in the Philippines? Any advice or personal experiences would really help. Thank you!",

The one that is relatively low effort/bordering on passive: Social media pages (mostly Facebook, but starting to spread out).    \n   \nI started a Facebook page over the summer with the intent to monetize it. It finally happened about 2 weeks ago. The money isn't great yet (~$200/mo), and I definitely made some mistakes that are impacting that, but I'm learning and there's a pretty clear path to scale the money. I think it could be \"good enough\" income for me within the span of a month, and full-time job replacement income within 6 months. I'm able to spend part of an afternoon making and queuing up posts once every two weeks. So not fully passive, but pretty low effort.   \n    \nAnd that's just from content monetization (i.e. just getting paid to post). No affiliate marketing, no selling anything (although I'm working on print on demand stuff), no brand deals. I would like to sell my own merch, but the rest of the stuff I don't want to deal with, and shilling someone else's stuff doesn't really mesh with what I've made.    \n    \nI'm trying to settle on what my true attempt #2 is going to be, but I have a basic framework mostly narrowed down.",

Let me explain\n\nI'm junior account &amp;  just want to make some extra money for Christmas, I already had this workflow built but just for financial news. Its connected to Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok &amp; various other news outlets &amp; social media platforms. Then it alerts me of new stories before they hit the big platforms.\n\nThree months ago I started using my workflow to take trades on polymarket, thus this post. Its been fruitful so far. I get alerts on underreported news &amp; place trades on outcomes before the market reacted &amp; that's about it. Its not a sure fire method in the slightest, nor is it something super lucrative, &amp; it is risky as I often have to filter out fake news but it has been helpful as far as side hustles go.\n\nNow, I'm sure some of you are aware that this isn't exactly passive but I will be using this month to fix that issue. I'm currently working on making the workflow place the trades for me as well. Once this is done &amp; tested, I'll share an update.\n\nWhat i really wanted to share with you guys is that you should overlook the simple things, you never know, a simple system you use could be a money maker under different circumstances.\n\nAlso I apologize if this is super short, I really dont know how to explain, but feel free to ask questions &amp; ill try to answer as much as possible.",

So my only advice: pick something you really enjoy out of them and stick to it the most. If you put all your time in to so many other side hustles you’ll never get there. Put most of your time in to one you really enjoy and you’ll get there. And it’s not a sprint: you won’t make it in a day or week. People take months and even years before seeing a profit. So if you’re not in it for the long haul and growth then get a real job, finish school, and mature some then try. Not saying you’re too young, but if you don’t have discipline and patience you won’t succeed. Or at least from the people I’ve seen with those mentalities.",

I don’t touch a single line of code.\n\n\nI’m basically a human \"editor\" for AI. I read through responses it generates and help refine them so they’re more accurate and conversational. \n\nIf you have a good handle on language and a sharp eye for detail, that’s really all the \"technical\" skill you need. They didn’t require any prior AI experience to get started, which was the big selling point for me.\n\n\nA few things I’ve appreciated so far:\n\n\n**Real Flexibility:** I log on when it fits my schedule. No one is hovering over my shoulder.\n\n**Low Barrier to Entry: **You just take a skills assessment in your strongest subject (like writing or general knowledge) to get started.\n\n\n**The Work Itself: **It’s actually kind of interesting to see how the \"brain\" of an AI develops based on the feedback you give it.\n\n\nIt’s been a great way to get into the tech space without having to go back to school for a CS degree. If you’re looking for something remote that’s flexible and straightforward, it’s definitely worth looking into.",

It was a lecture for a college class, no one was mic-ed except the professor and he asked a lot of questions to the students. I had to determine the different students with only the audio, like if one answered more than 1 question i had to be able to recognize their voice. no video came with the audio. I submitted it several times and it was rejected for failing to properly identify speakers correctly, despite the otherwise accurate transcription of what was said. that was very frustrating.\n\nanother job involved a non-native english speaker with a strong accent.\n\nbasically, the starting jobs seemed to be the jobs the seasoned workers didn't want to touch. if i remember right, the more jobs submitted and the better the accuracy, the higher priority one could get for the easier to transcribe work.\n\nthe time required and the pay for that time wasn't really that good for someone like me, my typing average at the time was about 65wpm at 99% accuracy which i admit, isn't that impressive, basically the bare minimum needed for the jobs.\n\nif you are a fast and accurate typer, have good listening skills and hearing, it might be feasible if you stick with it. especially if you have and know how to use the foot pedal transcription things. you still might get work rejected however, sometimes for reasons that seem unfair or don't make sense. having a low rating at the beginning can prevent more work from becoming available.\n\njust my take on it, like i said, it was awhile ago and maybe they have changed. it is a legit company though. i did get paid. it was not easy and not much.",

So make sure to get Slack access for direct communication with the Team for any project you are on, which is much better than email. \n\n\nThis is my first project with Appen so I'm not a long term worker, so I don't know how its gonna be though.\n\n\nBut I would avoid the Crowdgen subreddit though.

I wish we had an official Crowdgen subreddit with neutral Mods,  but that is not the case. \n\nSo, slack channel as the official channel is your best option for getting project related help OR for general Crowdgen related questions, posting here in subs like these  which seems more user friendly, allows you to express, helps.  ",

I intend to touch on the corners that I didn’t see explored much on these posts. \n\nI started out learning about running a business and started my own experimentally before i considered myself an entrepreneur. \n\nI started learning skills long before i considered myself an entrepreneur. I filed for my first llc etc; long before i needed to, and did a lot of derping around as do many of us. \n\nThe things I would say I learned that would have sped up the process was, consistency, in particular if your plan requires building and nurturing an audience. Also take advantage of Ai. Sure you can be successful without it, probably. But why make it harder on yourself? Be mindful of shiny object syndrome. The strength i already had was willingness and vision to pivot.\n\nI did make some money as a consultant as I’ve built out other things. I had a client who was previously a CFO and I learned a lot through that.\n\nLearn from whoever there is to learn from. Make sure they actually have success and know what they are talking about. Be very mindful of any partnerships or collaborations you make. \n\nTo bring another important perspective I haven’t seen much of on this thread, the people in your life have a huge impact on your success. So does self awareness. There’s a higher prevalence of things like narcissist personality disorder and adhd (me lol) in entrepreneurship, so self awareness and solid boundaries and genuine confidence are super important. Yes there are people who don’t have these who are successful, but it definitely makes it easier. You will learn all of these things the hard way if you don’t learn it with intention. \n\nBe mindful of bottle necks, and learn to take calculated risks. Those that are risk averse tend to be less likely to get to this level as well. \n\nYou are in control of your own time and life. You will find how much of the time we tend to spend doing busy work that doesn’t actually move the needle. Failure is feedback. That’s it. \n\nYour self care MATTERS. I have spent countless time living off of redbull and prayer. Learning balance gives you a clear head and the opportunity to make better decisions. \n\nWhatever you struggle with today and master tomorrow is an important opportunity. Especially if you struggled because you couldn’t find the thing you needed and had to create your own solution. Simple is almost always better.",

It dosen't get easier, it gets more challenging.   \n  \nBut that's the point, it's not a game for the weak or lazy. we work monday to saturday and our business is operating 24/7. whoever said they just dropship products and work 4 hours a day is in a very much different income bracket than us.",

      "selftext": "I’m posting this because I keep seeing people online claiming they’re making money with AI, side hustles, tools, prompts, whatever. I tried. Properly. And it went nowhere.\n\nThis wasn’t “get rich quick”. I was aiming for a very modest amount per month. Something realistic. I’ve worked in large organisations for years, so I approached it like a real project, not hype.\n\nHere’s what actually happened.\n\nFirst I tried starting a blog (WordPress). That alone took way more time than expected. Setup, themes, plugins, decisions everywhere. No clear design. And the chatbot had absolutely NO CLUE about how to create and build a wordpress blog, even though it constantly told me how to do it, only to find that that was impossible then kept blaming Wordpress for changing its UI.  SO annoying.\n\nThen I spent several weeks building a Ghost blog site. The idea was AI would surface rumours and I’d investigate or debunk them. This fell apart completely. AI could not provide *any* reliable sources for any rumour it generated (and it generated A LOT!) Since provenance was the whole point, the project was dead. If I couldn't prove there was a rumour, how could I disprove, reject or corrorobate it?\n\nIn parallel I put up 4 Fiverr gigs. Carefully written with AI leading the way on how to correctly create a gig for maximum exposure. Low prices. Clear scope. Weeks later, zero orders. Maybe something comes eventually, but there’s no sign yet that this works at all. OK, probably not directly attributable to AI, BUT - it was AI that led me down this rabbit hole...\n\nI also explored a bunch of other AI-related service ideas. Every single one sounded OK until I asked basic questions like:  \n\\-who is actually paying?\n\n\\-why would they pay someone who is basically cold calling them?\n\n\\-what work already exists?\n\n\\-what cost is being replaced?  \nOnce you force those answers, most ideas collapse pretty fast.\n\nCosts weren’t huge but they were real:  \nChatGPT Plus \\~$50  \nGhost blog \\~$20  \nPlus six weeks of focused time\n\nReturn so far: zero.\n\nWhat bothers me is how misleading the public narrative is. From what I can see, most people “making money with AI” fall into one of four categories:\n\n1. they already had an audience\n2. they’re selling to people who want to make money with AI\n3. they’d earn the money anyway and AI gets the credit\n4. they’re exaggerating or lying\n\nAI is useful. I still use it. But as a way for an individual to create *new* income from scratch? I just don’t see it.\n\nI am posting this because negative experiences don’t get shared much, and I suspect a lot of people are quietly finding the same thing and assuming they’re the problem.\n\nI don’t think I was.\n\nPostscript - and THIS is ironic.  I got the chatbot to write up exactly why you should not use AI in the way I wanted to generate a small income. But Reddit would not accept it because it was written by an AI!!  So even *criticising* AI monetisation using AI tools can get you blocked from the places where the warning would matter most!",

Once you decouple the os from the data you cannot pair them. \n\nI eventually had to build a second mac, copy the files over individually to an external drive- it would not allow a volume copy,which took 4 days.\n\nTotally wiped the original Mac then copied the files to the new Mac \n\nI laughed at how ai would suggest something unrecoverable that didn't work then apologize after. There were about 4 major points it took me where I couldn't go backwards. I was extremely careful trying to corroborate what it told me. But the info often worked in older versions of Mac os  so the Internet said it worked too",

And the idea is that it would be free like say 5 tokens and after that you have to pay a monthly subscription. It would be so easy you would literally have a json prompt for LaTex code and send that to the chatgpt api, and then the response is the resume immediately reimagined for a specific job on the fly.

Then in October I had some personal stuff come up and I literally had to set boundaries. Started blocking out actual work hours, stopped responding to non urgent stuff after 6pm, and told clients upfront that I batch my communications twice a day.\n\nI was honestly scared theyd leave. But the opposite happened? My retention jumped to like 89% over the last 3 months. Clients seem happier, they respect the boundaries, and weirdly they value my input MORE now. I think because Im not constantly available Im forced to be more strategic with my responses instead of just reactive. Im working probably 15 hours less per week and somehow I've actually got some money set aside ($2.3k from Stаke) now which never happened before. Sometimes doing less is actually the move.",

Here's one:\n\nDo not quit your job! At least not right up front. You made up your mind to quit and start a company. Fantastic. My advice is not to quit your job to pursue your company full time until the last possible moment. While you are still working (and getting paid!) spend six months or so in the evenings planning. Get a team together, do your research, build a business plan, go another level deeper and get all of the detail of product development and the company administration planned out.\n\nBuild as much of your company as possible while someone else is footing the bill for your survival. I can't tell you how many times I've had this discussion and when I say this the founder hangs their head a little. My response - you quit your job already, didn't you? Founding a successful company is hard enough without putting the (unnecessary) added pressure of having to worry about survival money on the first day. Even if you've saved, why not use a continuing salary from your current job to get going.\n\nMore in future posts. Hope this helps some.",

It takes time to build up the reps, but once you start doing it consistently, you will feel so much better about the day you had when your head hits the pillow at night. Every day is a challenge, and all we can do is put in a little bit extra every day to hopefully find our own paths to a fulfilling life and career.\n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts, and hopefully we can all find more success in 2026 than we had in 2025.",

We launched in September 2025.\n\n  \nmy original go-to-market strategy was:\n\n1. launch in UAE then expand to US and then other countries.\n\n2. burn cash on ads to get plumbers/electricians etc to sign up.\n\n3. burn cash on SEO to rank for keywords.\n\n  \nthen the weirdest thing happened. In October and November we started seeing registrations from random places, like small towns in Europe, Asia, USA, UAE, Australia, etc. i assumed it was a spam bot, but the profiles were real service providers. \n\ni dug into referral traffic. it wasn't google search. it was AI.\n\n  \npeople and other agents were asked tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, perplexity, Claude, ... you name it: \"where can i list my service business for free?\" or \"alternative to Angi/Thumbtack with no fees\"  \nBecause my site was new, lightweight, and the value prop was clear (\"Free\"), the AI models picked it up and started recommending it as the primary answer. \n\n  \n**The result**\n\n* 5 years ago i would have needed a massive budget to get 1000+ worldwide verified listings.\n* Today, AI did the heavy lifting for free.\n\nI decided to pivot. i scrapped the \"US Only\" restriction. if AI wants to send me a carpenter from Berlin or a graphic designer from Tokyo, i'm taking them.\n\n  \n**The challenge now:** The \"Supply\" side (service providers) is scaling automatically thanks to AI. Now i have to solve the \"Demand\" side (customers) to make sure these pros actually get work. \n\nThings are growing slowly, but surely, and i see the progress over there. \n\nI'm curious if anyone else has stumbled into this sort of \"accidental\" traction recently? To be clear, i don't consider this \"success\" in the traditional sense yet - we aren't huge, and we still have a mountain to climb regarding revenue and daily active users. But as a first step, having AI drive our initial user base for $0 feels like a fundamental shift from the old playbooks. If you've had similar small wins or weird AI- driven growth stories in these early stages, i'd love to her them. ",

These  marketplaces work if you have at least one category, in one single city figured out well.\n\nIts a bit the same as when you let your META ads just focused on lead volume, often you only get volume of the shittiest possible leads.

Example they may hate their boss and hate being at work every day, while I bet you like yours ;)  I hope lol.  But I work with a lot of entrepreneurs, and I can tell you almost across the board they're feeling it the same way you are.    \n  \nThe ones who are growing aren't growing as much as they had hoped. Three of my long-term clients decided to retire early and close their business because the impacts of tariffs made their business no longer feasible. Others struggling with softer sales than anticipated. So it's not just you, but I also know how you feel ... we all do.  And you're not unemployed, you are SELF-employed. Sometimes that mental shift helps.   \n  \nThe fact that your business is still going means it has NOT failed, because it's still going.

None of your friends have become doctors, and hardly even nurses after two years.\n\nWhat do you mean you've always been an entrepreneur at heart? you just started your adult life.\n\nI don't want to give life advice, it's all about you and how you want to live your life.  If you really have entrepreneurial spirit this is most likely what you should explore. If you want to be a doctor as well, be an entrepreneurial doctor. Become a dentist and aim for a chain of dental clinics. Become a surgeon and instead of curing people fill up their boobs, or much easier, just spend your days injecting some tiny amounts of liquid into their lips and muscles for massive profits. You can be passionate about heart surgery yet invent a non existing procedure or device and make millions upon millions, and you can do that probably do similar in almost any medical specialty.\n\nNurses? overworked and probably underpaid. Doctors? mostly very busy, stressed, have no life, and probably therefore even if well paid are underpaid, since they have no life and are literally giving their life away to the job.\n\nYou quite simply need to decide what you want to be and how your want to live, and what kind of lifestyle you want in the future.\n\nSo what if your first business is failing or failed, or your second or third. If and when you make it, you could retire while watching your peers give their lives away for \"good pay\" and status, but literally having no life. However, you could also keep on failing forever, or at least not making it the way you want to and they took over in any way that you consider as a success, be it home ownership, an expensive car, a trophy wife, or whatever else people compare themselves with, with their peers.  None of that is a guarantee of any degree of happiness. In fact I guess most people are unhappy, frustrated or jealous in some shape or form.  Life and your choices are filled with risks, and you need to be able to live with your choices.\n\nYou are right to start thinking about this early, however, you need to always be vigilant and decide what is best for you, and what your path is, and be flexible at allowing yourself to make a change at any moment.\n\nTry to look far into the future, and think where you REALLY want to go.",

One should either have realistic expectations.If you look at the landscape then reality tells you that the system does everything for you in order to not succeed. It is as if everything hangs in suspense. This is the biggest failure of our so-called sophisticated culture. Everything in general while nothing in particular. Modernity is quite a scam, because nothing flows naturally.\n\nLuckily air, wind, and water have no such problems. So many people, aren't doing well in jobs either. With all the good narratives we never reach 100% employability or even 90% That is if it is actually a good thing, because it is shifting what you could do yourself mostly.\n\nI have reflected for so long about this problem. The crushing thing comes from the fact that you compare yourself; you play the hunger games as you will. In order to survive mental insanity you have to change your attitude. Don't play that game!",

Way cheaper than wire transfers and faster than PayPal in most countries.\n\nWise lets you hold multiple currencies and send directly to bank accounts. Fees are like 1-2% usually, not 10%. Most contractors can receive it within 1-2 days.\n\nPayoneer works well too and some freelancers prefer it cause they can keep money in USD and withdraw locally when rates are good.\n\nReal talk though - just ask your contractors what they prefer. Some countries have better options than others. Like in Philippines, GCash or local banks might be easier. In India, direct bank transfer through Wise works great.\n\nSet a specific pay date (like 1st and 15th of month) and stick to it so you're not constantly managing who got paid. Automate reminders so you don't forget.\n\nThe 10% fees you're seeing are prob from using the wrong method. Switch to Wise or Payoneer and it drops to 1-3% depending on country.",

Sharing honest takes, lessons learned, even mistakes in places like Reddit or smaller communities builds trust surprisingly fast.\n\nWe also stopped trying to make broad content. Generic blog posts didn’t move anything. Very narrow, very specific content for one clear ICP did.\n\nCold outbound still works too, but it’s way better when it’s not actually cold. If someone has seen your content or recognizes your name, replies go up a lot.\n\nOverall, what’s worked best is just showing up where our ICP already hangs out, talking about the problem, sharing what we’re seeing, and helping.

The businesses I have seen scale cleanly usually had one or two channels that were boring but steady, then optimized the hell out of onboarding and follow ups so leads did not rot. When marketing spiked without ops ready, support volume exploded and churn followed. If Google ads already work, I would first make sure every lead converts cleanly before adding more channels. More traffic does not help if the backend is leaky.",

I am not proud of what I have become but nothing excites me more than Entrepreneurship so games get boring, even social media becomes boring, sort of everything. Anyone who has ever had this problem and how they overcame this identity addiction please give me some advice. Thank you\n\nEdit: Thanks you guys for the concern and advices. I just want to let you guys know that I like Entrepreneurship not for the money but the joy of building. The reason I made this post is because I noticed myself being a boring person with no hobbies but Entrepreneurship. Hence, I wanted to ask advices on hobbies similar in likes of Entrepreneurship or something that I can engage as much fun in Entrepreneurship. Thanks!",

If you've been building things, passing that knowledge on can be weirdly fulfilling. You're still \"building\" something - just with people instead of products.\n\nOpen source contributions. If you're technical, you can build things on weekends that aren't tied to revenue pressure. The building is the point.\n\nThe key is finding things where progress is visible and measurable - that's what most builders are actually addicted to, not entrepreneurship itself.",

When you go all in on building stuff it kind of eats everything else without you noticing.\n\nI don’t think it’s bad, but it helps to have something that has nothing to do with money or outcomes. Gym, running, cooking, random skills, even stupid hobbies. Something where you’re not trying to optimise or win.\n\nAlso you’re probably not boring, you’re just stuck in builder mode all the time.

Actually I admire people who can be so passionate about anything. \nI really do think that if you want to get really good at something, you have to invest a majority of your time and energy into it &amp; of course it’s difficult to excel at something like entrepreneurship and then at the same time have several hobbies. \nI think it’s okay to have one thing that you are really good at and really care about, rather than being someone, who’s kinda good and kinda interested in many things, but in a way not extemely passionate about anything in patricular at all. \n\nIf you’re worried about being boring to other people, I think you should surround yourself with other entrepreneurially spirited people, you can connect over your passion. Same goes for dating, if you care about that: being with a person who shares your passion for whatever is the most amazing feeling. You can talk about them for hours about the specific thing you have a shared interest in. \n\nHowever, if it’s really causing you distress, that you feel like all you can think about is entrepreneurship, then to me it sounds like you’re in a bit of a burnout actually. \nMaybe you are overwhelmed and don’t actually have the mental capacity to care about anything at all. \nMaybe you could have a break where you get away from your routine for a while and try something new, like going to a pottery class, skiing, hiking - whatever it is that can take your mind off things and maybe reinvigorate you.\n\nFinding a new hobby, although this shouodn’t be the goal, will also help you achieve more in your entrepreneurial endavours because you’re able to switch your mind off and actually think more creatively again therefore be better at problem solving.\n\nPs: don’t listen to people calling you boring, you are not, rest assured!!",

      "selftext": "My journey started out of necessity, not ambition. I was working at a truck repair shop when management kept making these insane decisions - one after another. Me and my coworkers eventually had enough and quit. At the time, I didn't realize I was about to become an entrepreneur.  \n  \nThe next few weeks were a blur. I was hustling just to keep the lights on - reselling stuff on eBay, fixing phone screens, building basic websites for friends. Whatever paid the bills. One night while I was down the reddit rabbit hole, I ended up on r/Entrepreneur and saw this post about someone crushing it with their cleaning company. I remember thinking 'why not? I could do that.' I’m writing this post hoping it inspires someone reading this as it did to me back then.   \n  \nStarting off was rough. I had no idea how to find cleaners, price jobs or even structure the business. The first website? Just a cookie-cutter theme that every other cleaning company was using. But it worked well enough to get us started. As we grew, I realized the website needed to be better - this wasn't just some placeholder anymore, it was an actual asset bringing in money. So I invested in a proper logo and custom site. We kept on growing but felt limited by leads we were getting as most of them were paid. The cost to acquire clients was high and we wanted to convert as many as we can - which presented its own challenges.  \n  \nThis prompted us to look at how to rank our website which took me on another trail I wasn’t ready to go down on. The first overseas team we worked with ranked us but for landing pages built on their website and for keywords no one was searching for! At that time I didn’t understand long tail keywords or much related to the art of sending signals to google. I soon moved on and tried my luck locally. We hired a local firm on a premium retainer basis and under a year-long contract to deliver us that sweet local organic traffic we hoped would result in bookings. A year later? Barely anything to show for it. Started investigating and found out the blog content I paid for was recycled from their other cleaning clients. The back-link strategy? Just a web of links between all their customers. I was beyond pissed when I figured it out.\n\n  \nAt that point, I'd been burned enough that I just started learning it myself. Optimized our Google Business Profile, rebuilt the website properly, created actual useful content and a bunch of other stuff - the agencies should've been doing way back. We started to see the organic leads increase month by month and stopped relying on paid leads eventually. It took years and cost me way more than it should have, but it was worth every headache to finally have this figured out. \n\n  \nPerhaps it's too soon to be writing this out here because it's only just the beginning but I wanted to connect with other entrepreneurs who've been on similar journeys. The road gets lonely sometimes, and hearing other people's stories - the wins, the failures, the pivot moments - that's what keeps me going.  \n  \nI’d love to read your stories about how you became or plan to become an entrepreneur. Cheers!",

The entrepreneurial journey is never a straight line, and your story shows that persistence pays off even when things feel impossible.\n\n\n\nI had a different path - bought an existing company thinking I could turn it around, but ended up having to shut it down after just a year. It was brutal. The lessons I learned during that time were invaluable though. Understanding cash flow the hard way, realizing that not every business can be saved, and learning when to cut losses instead of throwing good money after bad. It stung, but those failures taught me more than any success could have.\n\n\n\nWhat kept me going was the same thing that kept you going - consistency. You showed up every day, learned what you didn't know, and adjusted when things didn't work. That's what separates people who eventually succeed from those who give up.\n\n\n\nKeep at it.

That’s a perfectly valid choice.\n\nI’m talking about founders who want to leverage **talent**, **capital**, **infrastructure**, and **speed**.\n\nWe tend to underestimate the value of being born or operating in Western countries nowadays. Yes, there is a lot to criticize and improve, no system is perfect, but the legacy you inherit is invaluable.\n\nWhen a founder operates with a team, efficiency matters. You don’t have time to constantly deal with:\n\n* people not being punctual (and it being “normal”)\n* deadlines not being respected (and it being “okay”)\n* feedback not being taken seriously\n* lack of accuracy and accountability\n\nIn many Southern countries, people are raised in environments where predictability is not a priority. A predictable environment with fewer frictions and fewer surprises is something many people in Western cultures take for granted.\n\nAs a founder, you end up wasting an enormous amount of energy on things that are **not core to your business**.\n\nThe hardest part is this:\n\nSome people accept this as “part of the culture” and don’t want to improve it, because changing it feels like betraying their identity and you are the one told you’re taking things too seriously.\n\nI know this is a sensitive topic, and I’m not trying to generalize or stigmatize anyone.\n\nBut as a founder, you don’t have the luxury of failing because of things that have nothing to do with your product, your market, or your execution.",

      "selftext": "I started my business in April 2025, so officially less than 12 months. Started negative and used my credit card to fund the business.\n\nLittle back story about myself. I’m a carpenter by trade. Always been entrepreneurial and had an interest in business/making money. Didn’t come from money. Had a few small businesses over the years, some failed, others just weren’t viable. \n\n2025 started rough for myself. I experienced severe anxiety for the first time. Spent 2024 hustling and trading. Managed to build up an account to multiple 6 figs but got greedy and lost majority of it at the end of the year. Even lost my finances 10k that she trusted me with. I had to come clean and admit what I had done.. it was one of the hardest conversations of my life. \n\nThat leads me into the business, obviously having lost a significant amount of money, still had a job. I had to figure out ways to earn more to somehow get myself out of the hole I dug.\n\nSo I started doing a few cash jobs on the side, outside of work hours.\n\nInstalling basic shower screens, found work from apps where people posted jobs they needed done and I could quote/compete with others. \n\nAfter a few months of doing a few jobs a week. I could see there was profit to be made and the jobs had a quick turn over. 1 job in 45mins in some cases with profit of 50-60% \n\nSo I built a website with the help of AI, very basic, stock images and a few of images from\n\nI had done. Then I setup a Google ads campaign. Very basic, just let Google guide me. (I did have some previous experience with Google ads). \n\nWithin 10mins of the campaign being live. I had a form enquiry, I actually couldn’t believe it. Here I was laying in bed. I showed my fiancé and she brushed it off but I got excited, thinking if I can get a lead from $25 campaign.. imagine how many I can get if I increase my budget.\n\nWell the next day I increased to $50 a day.. and sure enough the leads increased. Here I was at work, phone ringing and emails coming through. Booking in as many jobs as I could. I could earn my weeks wage in a day - so I had to make a decision and speak to my fiance. Knowing I had a secure income, 150k a year and just lost a heap of money a few months prior. I didn’t expect her to support me, but she did.\n\nSo I took the leap. It was hard work, I was doing everything and sure enough had no idea how to run a business. Constantly learning, I had no idea what was involved and the amount of work behind the scenes. \n\nFast forward to now. I now have 2 employees. We are on track to do $1M revenue in the first year of business with 20% net profit. I still don’t have a factory, working out of the garage for as long as possible. \n\nThe goal is to expand to other states but first build the business and systems, test and ensure it’s a well oiled machine.

      "selftext": "At the start of 2025 I got into an online business model. For months I was just learning, watching videos, studying etc. I’ve always been better at talking than doing, but I really did understand the model inside and out.\n\nBy September I finally took the leap and it actually worked. Within two weeks I was earning, and in November I made over $20,000. For the first time I felt like \"oh damn im actually gonna make it\"\n\nBut then I messed up... I lost more than half of it because of a platform policy violation. Honestly, I could've avoided it but it is what it is.\n\nAround the same time, a guy I’d been talking to since February basically disappeared from my life. We had over 100k messages between us and talked every single day about this business. He started building a tool, I helped him, and we became partners. I genuinely thought we were building something together. Then he found loopholes in our contract and cut me out to work with someone else.\n\nSo within a few weeks, I lost a lot of money and someone I thought had my back.\n\nI’m 18 and still live with my parents. I pay my share of the bills and I have enough saved to get through 2026 without a job, so I’m not in danger or anything. But mentally, I’ve been stuck. I wake up around 1pm, watch YouTube, play games, tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve fixed a few small habits, but I just can’t get myself to actually work again.\n\nAt night it’s worse. I stay up until 3am because when I try to go to bed I either feel lonely or my brain won’t shut up. I do have a girlfriend, and honestly, all I want long term is to be able to provide for her one day. That’s what drives me deep down. But right now, I just feel like I lost my momentum and don’t know how to get it back.\n\nI’m not looking for hustle clichés or “just grind harder” advice. I’m just wondering how people get themselves moving again after losing money, trust, and confidence all at once.\n\n**TL;DR:** Built an online business at 18, made good money, lost most of it due to a mistake, then got cut out by a partner I trusted. Now I’m stuck, barely working, sleeping badly, and trying to figure out how to start again.",

Not because you need it or you're out of shape or anything, because it will help focus some of your energy, and I'm sure you got some angst built up. Put all that to good use and start lifting weights, do it for 90 days and see how you feel. \n\nIt won't really change anything, but I promise you will feel better. Cardio is good too, I just lift, it helps so much just a lift heavy, makes you feel really good afterwards. Do it everyday, because every day you will get a boost from it. Try to do it first thing in the morning, but just do it every single day even if it's not like a huge thing. I spend about 30 to 45 minutes in the gym everyday, it ain't life-changing, it's enough to boost me through the day. \n\nBetter than any drugs I ever tried.",

We work with a lot of retail brands and the ones crushing it seem to use their physical stores as retention tools (events, exclusive drops, etc) rather than just sales channels.\n\nAlso curious - what's your split between online/physical revenue? And did you start with stores then go online or vice versa?\n\nFor context, I run a B2B SaaS focused on retention analytics.

Instead of just dropping the price like I normally would, I was honestly just tired and broke down exactly what everything cost. Like I showed them the supply costs, explained labor hours, even mentioned that I keep some money saved aside (like $7k from Stаke) for equipment replacements that I factored into pricing.\n\nThey ended up booking it AND referred their realtor to us. Now I do this with most estimates when people seem hesitant and my close rate went from like 40% to almost 70%. People seem to actually appreciate seeing where their money goes instead of just getting a final number.\n\nI thought being transparent would make me look amateur or unprofessional but its been the opposite.

          "body": "I’m a plumber and make a lot of my sales the same way. I compare customer supplied replacements to my replacements where I provide the parts, then I compare those options to repairs where they keep their old parts. Once they realize my profits are about the same and the price only varies bc of my costs, they tend to go with the most expensive option bc they get the most value out of it. Customers don’t have a problem with spending a lot of money on their homes, they have a problem with overpaying for services. Probably because of big companies that charge insane rates to pay for their marketing. Most clients don’t really sympathize for your marketing campaigns, let alone all your other overhead, so they tend not to itemize everything. As smaller companies it’s more important to build a closer relationship with your clients, since we don’t cycle as many. Our repeat clients and reputation is everything so if it works, keep doing it.

      "selftext": "For most of my adult life I followed the script. Good job, good title, income that looked impressive on paper. From the outside it was a success story. On the inside I was counting down Sundays and dreading Mondays.\n\nEarlier this year I finally said out loud what I’d been avoiding for years: I didn’t actually want that life. So I left.\n\nNow I’m building two things from scratch , one is a small, steady business that’s working but still fragile, and the other is a more ambitious idea that needs constant experimentation. Marketing, testing, figuring out ads, learning how much attention everything really demands… I massively underestimated how competitive and mentally exhausting this phase is.\n\nThe hardest part isn’t even the money. It’s the identity shift.\n\nI used to be “the one with the good job.” Now I’m the person explaining I’m building something and hoping it doesn’t sound like I’m making excuses. It’s choosing cheaper dinners, skipping trips, and feeling that subtle sting when old colleagues casually mention bonuses.\n\nSome days it’s empowering. Other days it’s honestly humbling in ways I didn’t expect.\n\nWhat I’ve gained, though, is a whole new respect for anyone who makes it through this awkward middle stretch , the part where nothing is certain yet and you’re lying awake at 3AM wondering if you made the bravest decision of your life… or the dumbest.\n\nIf you’ve gone through that identity whiplash after leaving a “safe” career, I’d really like to hear how you handled it.",

Titles, pay, and external validation disappear overnight, and there’s nothing immediate to replace them. When you’re early in building something, there’s no scoreboard yet, so it’s easy to feel like you’re floating without proof that the decision was right.\n\nWhat you said about the awkward middle really matters. That stretch where the old life is gone but the new one hasn’t solidified yet is mentally exhausting. You’re taking on risk, uncertainty, and constant decision-making without the dopamine hits that a stable career provides. It’s not surprising that nights get long and doubts get loud.\n\nPeople who come out stronger on the other side usually find ways to separate self-worth from short-term outcomes. Instead of asking “does this look successful yet,” they anchor to progress, skills gained, and control over direction. It’s a quieter kind of confidence, but a more durable one.\n\nYou’re not weak for feeling this. You’re in the part most people never see because they turn back before it passes.

Doing this means he can decide when (or if) to pay you, so he doesn't have to factor it in much on his expense schedule. Basically, you're low-priority to him (and yes, you are being disrespected).\n\nIn addition, there is the [time value of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money) - the longer a payment can be delayed, the less it's worth in real-world value. Getting paid in January is worth more to you than having the same amount paid in September, and likewise delaying a payment means the customer is paying you less in value even if they're paying the same amount in raw numbers.\n\nTo mitigate this, you may want to look at including items in your contracts, such as late payment penalties that increase over time (and, at some point, become extreme enough to trigger payment), base rate increases (or loss of access to discounts) for customers who regularly pay late, or simply declining credit (including n30/n90 etc) for customers who have a history of late payments.\n\nIn addition, move everyone over to the new contract at the end of the current one - this guy should not be able to 'grandfather' themselves in just because they're a long-term customer; what they actually are is a long-term *deadbeat*.",

In his head, you’re effectively an interest-free credit line.\n\nThe reason he does it is simple: there’s no consequence. You keep delivering, so partial payments work for him. He’d never try that at a supermarket or with utilities because service would stop immediately.\n\nAt some point this stops being about why he’s doing it and becomes about what you’re willing to allow. If you want this to change, you need to change the rules. That usually means clear payment terms, stopping work when the account hits a limit, or requiring payment upfront before new materials are produced.\n\nIt’s uncomfortable, especially when someone is a good customer in volume, but reliable payment matters more than volume. Right now he’s treating your business differently because you’re letting him. Once payment becomes a condition of continued work, you’ll get your answer very quickly.",

This is my third employee I've hired (second employee I currently have). How do I navigate letting him go?

Have your employment attorney set that up for you, it is state and city specific. Don’t go cheap here, it will be pricey to set it up for first time. It will cost you a lot more if you don’t set it up correctly. \n\n2. Setup probationary period. I recommend it just under when unemployment insurance kicks in. For NY, it’s 6 months. We have ours set at 5 months and 29 days. That means, you can terminate whenever you want without dinging your UI premium.\n\n3. Setup employee duties and KPI’s. It must be clearly  stated and listed in your employee manual. Failure to meet KPI = retraining, sanction, then eventual termination.\n\n4. Evaluation - new hire are evaluated weekly for first 8 weeks. They need to know whether they’re meeting KPI’s or not. The written evaluation with KPI metrics is what legally protects you. Employee may claim any false statements, but a weekly evaluation with poor KPI and signed by both you and the employee, that is your proof that you terminated due to poor KPI, not due to whatever issue they claim. Depending on nature of the job, after 8 weeks, we do bi weekly then monthly. We switch to quarterly for all employees after probation.\n\nMost small business owners don’t do evaluations, and find quarterly to be a pain. You want to do this so you can also give bonus and rewards based on KPI’s. We give staff bonuses for monthly KPI’s and quarterly KPI. It also shows to the employee that you are the captain of the ship, employees want a leader. Most owners are not leaders therefore there's nobody manning the helm. That invites employees to start getting away with anything, such as theft, time clock theft, PTO abuse, etc. Quarterly eval and business meetings help reinforce your business vision and goals, which boost morale and focus employee energy to a productive goal.\n\nOnce you list KPI’s are not being met, give a verbal warning. Document it in their file, date, time, what you said and their response. Email yourself for time stamp proof. Employees get two verbals then written reprimands.\n\nAs the old saying is true, fire fast, hire slow. I’d talk with your employment attorney quick, prep to terminate that employee soon.\n\nFuture hiring, create a more stringent hiring system to ensure they can do the KPI’s. That employee should never have made pass the screening phase, definitely shouldn’t have made pass the interview test which should include testing the KPI’s, and if they somehow made it through and not meeting KPI, terminate within 2 weeks or sooner.",

Read it, don't read it, I don't care, I am just telling you because it accelerates your business success by years by just reading it and taking notes for 1-2 weeks.\n\n2-This is from working at a FTSE100, we call them the 1%ers. Also in my business, we make the best products in the market and it still applies. You could make the best product possible and 1% of people will complain. You need to accept this fact. Don't let negative feedback pull you down. Too much negative feedback as a % of sales is what you should be concerned about.\n\n3-Just do it, if the risk is low, JUST TRY THE THING. We spent too long trying to make the perfect product, listings, images etc. You learn more by just doing. We also know that as much as 30% of everything we list will fail. So we will remove it from Amazon FBA after time (this applies to any business). \n\n4-The right people are more important than anything else. Do you have the right mix? Do you complement each other? Can you drive eachother forward? Success can be magnified X10 or even fail depending on the people. If they aren't the right fit, walk away. There is somebody out there that is perfect for you, so don't worry about taking a bit of extra time to find them.",

I’ve been a barista for about 8 years now. I spent about 5 1/2 years In a local coffee shop and almost 3 years at a huge corporation ahem.. Starbucks which sucks and isn’t real coffee but I needed the benefits. So I have plenty of barista experience. I have been a supervisor/manager at both places. The small business i handled all of the inventory, did a lot of the marketing, a lot of the drink creating and spent a lot of my time and effort there. So I know how internally a coffee shop works and runs too but having my own business seems intimidating. I live in a very populated city, where coffee is a huge demand I’ve found a location I’d love to rent that fits the moody/ witchy vibe I’m going for (garage door, loft, rustic, dark exterior vibe) it’s apart of shopping/event center which I think would be perfect for foot traffic and exposure. There’s no coffee competition, just a hair salon, tattoo shop, bakery, pizza shop, brewery and some boutiques. I’ve done a lot of the research and have calculated the price of all of the things I’d need to do and have, my question I guess is what’s next? How do you make it happen? Is it worth it? ",

Keep all your costs low, and start with skeleton staff... and add more staff in when you need them,\n... it's ok to be busy and have people wait for a good product as long as they can see you are being efficient... if they are standing around waiting while staff are wandering around chatting or being a prima Madonna with the coffee machine they'll be gone. Don't buy the 'best' equipment, or have the best fit out but make sure it is functional, efficient and looks good. Make the coffee prices competitive but make sure you charge for every extra, and have lots of visually appealing grab and go style treats and food well displayed near the point of sale. And also try and budget for custom printed takeaway cups. Hopefully you are a good barista that is clean and efficient, has a good eye for extraction and making timing and grind adjustments and can effortlessly make silky smooth milks.... Because remember you must lead from the front and set a high standard for your staff. Good luck.",

Business takes work and it's always a gamble. The gamble on some types of businesses take longer to pay off or see a return. But lets say content creation as an example - this can take years to pay off but when you reach a certain point, you can call it passive income (to an extent).\n\nThis ties very heavily into the platforms someone chooses. If you are a streamer then your income is almost 100% tied to performing streams. If you do youtube then your income relies on you staying relevant so that your content is promoted. If you stop, your income wont stop immediately but its still tied to putting out content.\n\nI'm not saying this is a better business model than any other, but it does have unique advantages. You can quit youtube for a whole month (or longer) if you build up enough content to release on a schedule. People do this all the time. During this holiday or time off, the income is passive.

Just over two months ago, I launched a side project that’s quickly showing potential, and I’d love some advice on how to grow it.\n\n**The concept:**\n\n• I host regular board game nights at public venues.\n\n• Entry fee is $5 cash per person for the entire evening.\n\n• People can come alone or with friends, I place them on a table, they play games (not the niche tabletop ones, more social party games), and meet new folks.\n\n**Current setup:**\n\n• I’ve built a group on a popular social app (300+ members have joined organically, though only a fraction attend these events).\n\n• So far, attendance per event has ranged from as little as 2 ppl, to as high as 23 people (although these are the extremes, I have an average attendance of 7 ppl, and am consistently trending higher in recent events). I also happen to have a pretty good return rate, and there are now 6-8 regulars.\n\n• Upfront costs: \\~$547.22 for several board games, a few bits and bobs (pens, name badges, etc) and the app membership.\n\n• Income: \\~$645.00 in total (210 the first month, and 435 the second); I’m now officially in profit.\n\n• Venue is free (local bars or food courts), so no additional costs on my part there.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n• I want to grow attendance (30 attendees per session would be solid) and attract specific crowds (young people, 20-30, as well as more women to balance it out) and better leverage social media platforms.\n\n**Questions for you (and please share any useful advice):**\n\n• How would you scale something like this without raising prices? The $5 fee matches local board game café pricing and I want to keep it the same.\n\n• As the group grows, I'm aware that hosting duties will become more and more complicated, but I'm still unsure how to proceed - should I pay someone to help me host?\n\n• I’m struggling to reconcile my financial objectives with my willingness to make sure everyone is having a good time; basically, I’m very picky with who I invite. Most of my promo so far has been done through subreddits for the town I live in and Facebook groups – I always do a background check on people first, and have a quick chat with them to gauge the kind of person they are. I do this to avoid having problematic profiles (creeps, scammers, intolerant people, you name it) but this comes at an extra effort, and also highly limits the clients I get (I must lose 50% of potential customers with this system). I know it’s a stupid question even before I ask it, but have some of you found a good way to filter out the bad weeds in a more efficient way, or do you just take the risk to have these sorts of clients anyways?\n\n• I've had some suggestions to use a subscription system, but sounds quite complicated to set up logistically, and I like the idea of people having the flexibility of paying per session. Are there any real upsides to this system?\n\n• Creative ideas to reach more people? I'm struggling to find people in their twenties - it seems most user pools I'm targeting have 30 year olds...where are all the twenty year olds?? Same goes for finding women – very few of them seem to respond to my posts…I’m trying Instagram and TikTok which I hope might attract these crowds, but growth is painfully slow.\n\n• Anything else I should keep in mind moving forward? This is my first entrepreneurial project so I’d really appreciate any insights :)",

Either way they will appreciate the extra customers walking in the door. Just a thought. When I bartended at a brewery we had a group that would come in every Wednesday and play big board games together, I always thought it was really fun",

          "body": "I hate to be a downer but I'm not sure this makes sense as a business. It may make more sense simply as a fun thing that you enjoy, where the entry fees defray some of your costs. As a business, you've made $100 in profits over two months while ignoring the cost of your own time, which includes hosting the game sessions themselves as well as all the time you spend promoting them and recruiting and screening attendees. If you're doing this on a larger scale then you'll also probably want liability insurance. And a larger scale also probably means it's not always you who's personally running the game nights and doing the screenings, so you'll need to pay somebody. Even if it's just you, you should include your own notional \"salary\" in your figures in order to be realistic and not fool yourself - your time is not free. Try to estimate how much you're ultimately earning per hour of effort, after considering all your costs.\n\nTo make this work, I think you need to find ways to get more income per session. $5/person seems really low. Maybe buy games at wholesale and sell physical copies during sessions at retail prices: people like instant gratification. Sell game-related T-shirts and merch. Charge a small fee to indie game companies for including/promoting their games at your sessions. Create a newsletter or social media account for the group with affiliate links to where people can purchase the games that they played, so you earn a commission. Strike a deal with a bar or restaurant to get some percentage of the tab or a flat fee if your session brings in a minimum number of extra people on a normally slow day. Offer a membership option for something like $15/month as an alternative to paying as you go - many people are lazy and will sign up but then come rarely/never.",

          "body": "Good for you. I'm not sure how long you will be able to continue charging. I attend a weekly game meetup. It's free and there are anywhere from 25 to 40 ppl in attendance. It has been going for 13 years. I would be worried at some point a few of your attendees will swap contact info and say, \"hey, let's just start meeting at X and skip the entrance fee\". I recommend introducing at least one new game a month. Keep a real close eye on BGG's lists to stay current on your game selection. This might keep people coming back. All the game stores in my area have free weekly game nights, and game libraries ranging from 10s to 100s. So you need to determine what sets your paid event apart and better than the alternatives.\n\n20s is the wrong demographic IMO. I've been to boardgame conventions and boardgame meetups. The age demographic is more like 35 to 65. I'm guessing about 75% male to female. Also, college kids are pretty savvy using social media to coordinate and would also quickly recognize they don't need to pay someone to play a game. \n\nIf you are a really good story teller or theater geek, I recommend you look into Blood on the Clocktower and start hosting BotC events. If you get really good, people would definitely pay to attend and most would be regulars. But it doesn't scale well. 10 people at $10 each for 3 hours is not really worth it unless you love it.",

But it could be done on rotation basis, adding more venues as you find them. \n\nNext is turning the event into more of an event. Making it more enticing, enough for people to get out of the house, maybe bring some of their friends and plan for it instead of taking it for granted.\n\nIf every games day/night is the same old, people are going to think they can always go to another event.

Now you can do a rotation so each event is different and people who miss out can eventually 'try' it. \n\nYou can combine the above with additional themes, dressing up/cosplay, specific games, awards and prizes, etc to make each event even more enticing. \n\nUltimately you want to target people who have money to spend.

Wealthy people pay for their time and stress to be lowered. They’ll pay much more than you think. If you can give them their time back (10 hours per week for example) what is that worth to them?

          "body": "Not done a turnaround but have run a daycare/preschool. Some things to look at.\n\n1. Regulations: particularly important is square footage per student and teacher to student counts as they relate to classroom size. You also want to look at bathroom rules.  For instance our classes are set up where we have the exact square footage for a teacher and an aide to operate with the legal student numbers. We have in classroom bathrooms that allows the aide to handle that while the teacher continues.  We have a floating teacher that does enrichment that lets the mainline teachers take a lunch break. In other words you want to maximize labor to student counts while maintaining a good product. This stuff is so decisive we had an offer for free use of a building that we declined because the room sizes and bathroom locations made it a nightmare on labor to effectively staff it\n\n2. Security: Prior to Uvalde we had a dozen police officers who we gave tuition discounts to in exchange for working pick up and drop off. Since Uvalde we have an armed officer on campus at any time students are there.  Parents want to feel their kids are safe. Off duty cops make $45-$55 an hour in our area. If it doesn't have a camera system better set aside the money to put one in. \n\n3. Competition: Does the school district offer free pre k and kinder? If so you better deliver a high quality preschool rather than a day care or you are limited to very young kids who are more labor intensive.  Also be aware that many churches use preschool and daycare to both draw in new members and absorb building overhead costs but don't expect them to pay off the mortgage on a building or generate a profit. In both cases you may have legacy competition with essentially free real estate\n\n4. What sort of state funding is available for tuition and how bureaucratic is that system? If you go that route you may have a significant staff chasing reimbursement payments.\n\n5. Who is your customer and are you convenient? We specialize as the high end pre school. We are around the corner from the high end elementary magnet elementary school so multi kid parents aren't trying to drive across town.

How fast do you think you can get teachers for 100+ students?\n\nDaycares can have waiting lists for months, so getting students shouldn't be a constraint it's just hiring, training, and retaining the staff to allow you to intake 100+ students. Also notice how I say teacher and not staff. You will likely have staff who won't be with kids so they can't count towards the teacher:kid ratio.\n\nLet's say the state mandates 1 teacher for every 7 students. You should absolutely strive to be better than that, let's say 1:5. This allows you to have teachers call in sick and still be in compliance with the ratio set by law.",

Private equity firms are likely to snap up a decently-run center because they can add it to a larger portfolio and spread the risk around.

Be open when people need to buy things...i.e. - after 5 or 6 pm.  Most people work 8 or 9 to 5 or 6 so they might need to stop by AFTER or BEFORE work to buy supplies.  Also SUNDAY.  I can't tell you how many times contractors need to buy some lumber before heading to their job, but the local lumber store doesn't open until 8 or they're closed at 5:30 or they aren't open Sunday or they close early on Saturday.  Hence, they go to Home Fart-hole, which them becomes the default because they can't rely on the local store to be open.  Also, management needs to be THERE all the time.  No management = terrible customer service, stealing, embezzling, etc.  And competent management is vital, too.  If you don't know how to manage, get out of the way.  Pump up the fact you're a LOCAL business, FAMILY run and owned!!  So many people would love to avoid Home Crapo.  Or Lowes (quality).   Etc.  If you can offer something that your competition can't, or won't, do it!  I know people that go to Les Schwab (ewwwwwww!) for their free popcorn!!!  Seriously.  If there's a special service or product line or something that sets you apart, try it!  Maybe a store kitty!  or doggo!  Or you'll load their lumber for them!

Right now interest rates are at an all time high. So people who finance home construction/renovation are just not doing it right now. This is prolly 90% of your audience. People who pay cash for home construction/renovation are likely not messing with small local lumber yards.\n\nAlso, the economy in general is super crappy right now. I build websites for small businesses. I'm finding that in general all of my clients across multiple industry segments have 20-50% lower web traffic this year when compared to last year. This directly translates into fewer phone calls and as a result lower income. All of my contractor/construction clients have canceled their websites this year. So I think this is your audience.\n\nWithout knowing exactly where you are, I would suspect a substantial portion of your historic clientele either own a small business or are directly employed by one.\n\nHere's my advice, your family has likely spent decades building relationships with your community. Just because they're not spending money right now doesn't mean they wont when the interest rates come back down. Which let's be honest will happen when Powell is replaced in May. This year's gonna be rough for you, but if you can find a way to cut costs and hold on, eventually there will be a recovery, and if you have decades of history with your community you'll be at the forefront of the local recovery. Your audience know who you are and are counting on you even if they're not buying anything right now.\n\nthis is assuming things don't get worse. There's really no way to tell anymore.",

Renting out specialized equipment can have a high ROI.\n* **Propane Refills &amp; Screen Repair:** These are \"errand\" services. If they come to you to get their BBQ tank filled or a window screen fixed, they’ll likely grab a box of screws or a jug of cleaner while they wait.\n* **Delivery \"Project Kits\":** Package everything needed for a specific small project (like a raised garden bed or a mudroom bench) and offer flat-rate delivery within a 10-mile radius.\n\n  \nIn many cases, businesses like yours aren't failing because people don't want your products, but because they are Googling \"Hardware store near me\" and only seeing the big-box retailers (Home Depot/Lowe's).\n\nI specialize in helping local businesses reclaim their territory in search results.

With businesses like this I typically use SDE like this:\n\nOwner’s SDE x (multiplier of 0.8-1.2) + fair market value of assets - liabilities. \n\nThe multiplier is based on the recent growth of the business. Strong growth in profits? 1.1-1.2. Flat growth? 0.95-1.05. Declining profits? 0.8-0.9. \n\nFair market value of assets is tricky but you can just go to Facebook marketplace and look for similar. Generally I use the “priced to move” valuation. \n\nBrand recognition, loyalty, “good will” is harder to put a price on,  it ultimately it boils down to the profit the owners are taking home. So I don’t usually put a big number on that. \n\nThe fact that the owners are taking such a low pay for a big job is a concern. You’ll likely have to adjust the SDE to hire a replacement for one of them.\n\nSo $50k SDE x 1.0 multiplier + assets (rounding up) $40k - 0 liabilities = $90k valuation.",

The separate kitchen doesn't come with the business, but can a contract be put in place? What relevance is the full-time baker if they (presumably) work in the separate kitchen?\n\nIt sounds like the sellers are banking on an attractive location, established reputation, and \"could make\" $X level. You don't pay them for the incremental increase you have to pursue, so that last factor is irrelevant. My thoughts are the key, at least in the short term, is ensuring continuity of product availability and quality, particularly if you don't already have ovens or a third-party baker. Take a long, hard look at that part of the equation. Would your COGS be commensurate as what they were doing when they were, effectively, baking in-house?\n\nBeyond that, I would have to assume the location is a large part of the intangible value given retail bakers don't typically have much else that's readily long-lived and transferrable. And I'd get a sense of the sellers' intentions once they offload this location. If they're so good that they can forget this location and just start another near or at their bakery, and simply market themselves as \"We moved to...\" and undercut your prospective operations, then all you'd really be receiving is their stand at a historic location.",

The only reason to buy it is so that you can get the lease and start something new and different which you're hoping would be successful.  That would not be worth anywhere close to that though since it's a small footprint with limited options for turning it into something big.   I'd value it at 20k just so you can get your foot in the door with a good location.  But don't start the same business they had...you already know it doesn't work.",

There is more appeal to making 50 grand when you are your own boss as opposed to working 50 hours for someone else. Telling a couple of part timers what to do a day or two a week in a kitchen is not that big of deal. If you are going to be a single owner then you might just have to add a couple part timers and you might make more like 70k.\n\nYou also mentioned its the only way into the market so there value there as well.\n\nWhat I would ignore is the catering claim. There is nothing about the business you described that adds any value for catering. They rent kitchen time and all of the production and coresponding labor and expenses are directly spent suppling the market. Adding catering is not going to really leverage anything they are currently paying for. AND since they didnt do it I would guess not really possible and still do market or if it is they would have to put in a bunch more hours and they didnt want to.\n\nRun the numbers and see what they say, butno they dont sound crazy and might well get something close to their number.",

If someone wants to cancel, I give their deposit back about 99% of the time, but our contract states deposits are refundable solely at our discretion and there are no guarantees a deposit will be refunded. Generally the only reason I don't give refunds if the customer is rude or if it's been a very long time. In this case, it's been about six months.\n\nThe order was for about $10k, and we collected about $1,100.\n\nOur orders are typically filled in 2-4 weeks, but this customer was taking a long time to get his installation site prepared for the garage, then he called in to say the order needed to be placed on hold without an explanation. A few months later we follow up to see if he wants to leave it on hold or cancel the order, but we can't get reach him. A couple more months go by and the customer is reaching out wanting to cancel.\n\nI told him we can absolutely get the order cancelled, but we're only going to refund his deposit if his permit was denied due to issues outside of his control (the contract he signed is an older contract and states everything is non refundable unless the permit is denied and he is unable to remedy the situation). I told him if it's anything other than the permit being denied, then we can cancel it and give him in store credit for what he's already paid.\n\nI'm going to have to call this guy on Monday and tell him we're not giving him his money back, and whilst I don't necessarily feel bad about it due to how long it's been, the inability to reach him, failure to provide an explanation, etc, I do still feel some anxiety with actually having to tell him. It's my business, I own it, so at the end of the day it's my call. If I was just an employee and enforcing someone else's policy, then it'd be different.\n\nHow did you guys start getting used to being okay with being strict with your policy without feeling bad about things?\n\nEDIT: I just want to clarify, when I say \"rude\" people won't get a refund, I really mean excessively rude. I can handle cranky people who are short with me, but I draw the line at personal attacks/intentional disrespect.",

          "body": "I don’t think it’s just you, this is a very common experience with business brokers, especially on the smaller deals. A lot of them aren’t really acting like salespeople, they’re acting like gatekeepers whose main job is to not screw up the listing they already have.\n\nThe reason everything feels so locked down is usually seller paranoia mixed with weak qualification systems. Sellers are terrified their employees, landlords, or competitors will find out they’re selling, so brokers overcorrect by hiding even basic info. Instead of filtering serious buyers properly, they default to NDAs, questionnaires, and forced calls because that’s the only process they know.\n\nThe irony is that many brokers are also undertrained and overloaded. They blast generic auto replies because they’re juggling too many listings and most inquiries are tire kickers. When you ask for numbers before a call, some take it as a threat to their control of the process rather than a reasonable request. The “threatening to drop you” behavior usually means they’re insecure about either the deal quality or their own value.\n\nBusiness brokerage is very different from real estate because there’s no standardized disclosure culture. In real estate, rent and square footage don’t reveal who the seller is. In a small deli, revenue numbers can basically identify the business if you’re local, so brokers treat them like state secrets even when it hurts deal flow.\n\nIf you want less friction, you usually have better luck going one layer off the big listing sites. Accountants, commercial lenders, local attorneys, and even restaurant suppliers often know who’s quietly looking to sell and will make warm intros without the theatrics. Another option is dealing directly with owners through local networking or old-school outreach, which avoids brokers entirely, though you lose some protection.\n\nThere are good brokers out there, but they tend to work on larger, cleaner deals and don’t advertise heavily. On the lower end of the market, a lot of what you’re experiencing is just an industry that hasn’t evolved and doesn’t feel pressure to improve because sellers, not buyers, are their real clients.",

          "body": "In my experience, most modern hosting platforms should have stable uptime. I don't currently work with the kinds of sites that need backups so I can't contribute there. Infrastructure people (the sort that would discuss hosting) love scalability problems because that's what big tech pays big money for. That is why they talk about those things, but yeah that topic is usually not going to be super relevant to a small business. Short answer is that most modern hosting platforms that people speak positively about will do.  \n  \nOne thing to consider is that the point of higher end websites is to buy ads and send traffic to the site, then capture as many leads as possible. Performance and scalability can matter in those situations (probably performance more-so). A good designer wants to maximize the effectiveness of how the site sells visitors on your business so you get the most bang for you buck when advertising. \n\nThat being said, many small business owners don't see a website as a lead generation tool, even though I think they should (biased website maker talking). Many of them are just tired of saying \"no\" when people ask if they have a website.\n\nHopefully this was helpful somewhat, I don't have a lot to say about hosting because truly... most modern platforms handle all the hard stuff for you at reasonable monthly price, it's kind of plug and play.",

One from the cousin and the three others from what seem to be employees or associates of hers as they are all related with this same smoke shop she owns.\n\nWill Google delete them? I hope so but they’re not fake profiles. She was trying to use her “being a business owner” and “customer serviceness” to get us to break rules that are there for a reason.

Mention the timeline (reviews came hours after you refused service and received harassing calls), that they're from people connected to each other, and that this followed documented verbal abuse. Google doesn't always remove stuff, but coordinated retaliatory reviews from connected accounts is one of the things they actually do act on sometimes.\n\nScreenshot everything.

If Google doesn't help, having documentation matters if this escalates or if you need to respond publicly.\n\nOn responding to the reviews... personally I'd wait until you see if Google removes them. If they stay up, one calm factual response on the main one can help. Something like \"This review followed our declining service due to policy violations, after which we received harassing and abusive phone calls. We stand by our decision.\" Short, professional, lets future customers read between the lines.\n\nMost customers can smell a fake revenge review, especially when there's a cluster of them all at once with similar language.\n\nAlso... if the harassment continues at all, document everything.
