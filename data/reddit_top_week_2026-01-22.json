      "selftext": "I bought a Chevrolet Colorado in July of last year with the intention of starting a side hustle. I considered doing landscaping, hauling junk, or even buying a vending machine. However, while browsing Facebook Marketplace, I came across a listing for a used throne chair. I decided to research how much these chairs typically rent for in other areas and what I could potentially charge if I bought one. Keep in mind, I had no prior experience in the party or event business.\n\nDespite that, I decided to take a chance, bought the chair, and posted it for rent. The post received a lot of views, but no bookings at first. Most businesses in my area charge around $150 to rent a throne chair, plus a delivery fee, which usually brings the total to $180–$200. Since I wasn’t getting much interest, I decided to lower my price from $150 to $120, which also includes delivery within 30 minutes of where I live.\n\nAfter about 3.5 weeks and spending roughly $760, I honestly started to think buying the throne chair had been a bad idea. However, just a couple of days after lowering the price, I received my first booking—then my second, third, and so on. As bookings picked up, I eventually purchased a second throne chair for about the same price, except this one was brand new.\n\nFrom the end of August through the end of December, I made a little over $1,500. While most of that money went toward paying off the chairs, it became clear that there is a lot of potential in this type of business. Along the way, I’ve connected with people from schools, event coordinators, venue owners, and other local businesses.\n\nMy goal for this year is to make over $4,000. While that may not sound like a lot, it’s relatively easy money. The hardest part of the job is loading the chairs onto the truck and properly taking care of them. I make sure to clean them after every event and use bubble wrap on the corners and other important areas that could be easily damaged. I also purchased a tarp and stretch wrap to protect the chairs from dirt during delivery or while they’re waiting for the next booking.\n\nMy next goal is to add a bench throne and a 360 photo booth to the business. We’ll see what the future holds.",

          "body": "If you already work in data or analytics, there are a few side incomes that tend to be realistic and actually leverage that skillset instead of starting from zero.\n\nA lot of people do analytics consulting for small businesses. Things like setting up GA4 properly, cleaning up dashboards, or explaining where traffic or conversions are leaking. Small ecommerce brands especially struggle with this and will pay for clarity.\n\nAnother angle is freelance reporting or dashboard builds. Many founders don’t want complex models, they just want a simple weekly or monthly view that answers “what’s working and what isn’t.” That’s a fast win if you know SQL, Looker, Power BI, or Tableau.\n\nSome go the data audit or tracking setup route. Reviewing event tracking, pixels, attribution, and fixing broken data. It’s boring work for founders but high value.\n\nLonger term, people turn their experience into templates, tools, or micro products like dashboards, attribution spreadsheets, or cohort analysis templates and sell those repeatedly instead of trading time.\n\nThe common thread is that the money usually comes from translating data into decisions, not just running numbers. Businesses pay when analytics directly help them make or save money.",

I've been looking around and seen quite a few ideas and I'm mostly looking for something I can do online besides some nearby work like door dash etc.   \nSo I'm pretty shy overall as a person but I saw there's lots of different options I simply don't know exactly what to do or how? I saw that there was something like shopify and been trying that sort of but it's really confusing even with designs etc and even then I wouldn't be sure how to make use of it although its kind of set up haha. There's selling digital designs and again that's confusing.. I'm pretty shy and not too creative or artistic. I know there's feet finder and as a guy I don't really know if there's a market?   \nI just more so wanted some general help with a direction or advice or.. well, whatever you guys got!  \nthanks for sticking to the end and I'd appreciate any genuine ideas or advice, have a good one :)",

Please feel free to critique my idea, let me know how you would tweak it, and what you think works or doesn’t work\n\nI noticed that a lot of adult content creators like to use a link in their bio, and that there are a good amount of complaints that current link in bio platforms (LinkTree, Link.me) have been known to cause issues and have accounts on social media flagged, reducing the amount of viewers they are getting which is impacting their revenue\n\nI put together a site to try and capture this market, but am looking at how to improve it further before trying to get clients. The site is already live but I haven’t advertised it in any way yet, and includes made up example link in bio pages\n\nEssentially I want to run a subscription model to create ultra basic link in bio sites, but on their own domain to avoid being flagged. Additional benefits over traditional link in bio services is that it is ad free, and that I am directly serving them so won’t make a policy change later down the line that no longer allows adult content creators.\n\nSo in all, it’s just selling websites as a subscription, niched down to adult content creators that want a unique link in bio on their own domain. By stripping back the features of standard websites, I can make them very cheap, quick and easily.\n\nI want to know if this sounds like something that could work, or if it’s fundamentally flawed with something I missed before taking the next steps of finding customers",

      "selftext": "**TL;DR:** I got laid off in late 2024, saw a post on this subreddit about ElevenLabs voice cloning, and thought \"why not.\" 13 months later, I have 8 AI voice clones earning me over $1,000/month while I sleep. This is the detailed guide I wish I had when I started. I'll show you exactly how to do it, step by step.\n\n---\n\n## The Real Numbers–No Clickbait Here\n\nLet me just get this out of the way:\n\n* **Total earned to date:** $8,985\n* **Current monthly earnings:** ~$1,160/month\n* **Number of voices:** 8\n* **Time invested per month now:** Maybe 1-2 hours (checking stats, occasionally tweaking things)\n* **Full portfolio breakdown PDF (with earnings screenshots):** [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QpjMjdh4MU4vIadC6ZjSYqKWwhF4Puf2/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nI'm sharing my actual numbers because I've seen too many low-effort posts on this sub that say \"you can make money with AI voices!\" and then provide zero details. That's not helpful. This guide is going to be long, but by the end, you'll know exactly how to do this yourself.\n\n---\n\n## My Story\n\nIn late 2024, I got laid off. Not ideal, but I suddenly had time to explore side income ideas I'd been bookmarking for months.\n\nI stumbled across a post on this very subreddit about licensing your voice on ElevenLabs. The concept was simple: record your voice, upload it to their platform, and get paid every time someone uses it for their projects (YouTube videos, audiobooks, apps, whatever).\n\nI have a background in audio engineering, so I figured I had a slight edge. But honestly, the technical barrier is way lower than I expected. If you can follow instructions and speak clearly into a microphone, you can do this.\n\nI created my first voice, and within a few weeks, I was making a couple hundred dollars. I immediately created another. Then another.\n\n**Here's what most posts don't tell you: the real strategy is building a portfolio of voices, not just one.**\n\nMy top-performing voice averages $308/month. But I have another that only makes $16/month. If I'd stopped at one voice and it happened to be the $16 one, I probably would've given up and told everyone this doesn't work.\n\nInstead, I kept going. Now I have 8 voices across different categories, and the portfolio as a whole is what makes this a legit income stream.\n\n---\n\n## What Is Voice Cloning? Let me explain.\n\nElevenLabs is an AI company that offers text-to-speech technology. Users can type text and have it spoken aloud by AI voices.\n\nHere's where you come in: ElevenLabs has a Voice Library where creators can upload their voice clones and license them to other users. Every time someone uses your voice to generate audio, you get paid.\n\n**Who uses these voices?**\n\n* YouTubers and content creators\n* Audiobook producers\n* App developers\n* Podcasters\n* Game developers\n* Businesses making training videos\n* People creating voiceovers for social media\n\nThe demand is massive and growing. AI-generated voiceovers are everywhere now, and people need high-quality, natural-sounding voices.\n\n---\n\n## What You'll Need Before Starting\n\n**The Essentials:**\n\n1. **A decent microphone.** You don't need a $500 setup. A solid USB condenser mic like the Audio-Technica AT2020 (~$100) or even the Fifine K669B (~$30) can work. The key is clarity, not expense.\n2. **A quiet recording space.** This matters more than your mic. A closet full of clothes actually makes a great recording booth. You want minimal echo and no background noise (no AC humming, no traffic, no roommates).\n3. **Basic audio software.** Audacity is free and works great. GarageBand if you're on Mac. I personally use Pro Tools, but that's overkill for this.\n4. **30+ minutes of high-quality audio.** This is ElevenLabs' minimum requirement for a Professional Voice Clone. More on what to record later.\n5. **An ElevenLabs Creator Plan.** That's $22/month ($11 for your first month with the 50% discount). This is your only ongoing cost. [More on this below]\n\n**Optional But Helpful:**\n\n* A pop filter (~$10) to reduce plosive sounds (harsh \"P\" and \"B\" sounds)\n* A mic stand or boom arm to keep positioning consistent\n* Basic knowledge of audio editing (removing breaths, normalizing levels)\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Set Up Your ElevenLabs Account\n\nHead to ElevenLabs and create an account. Here's my link: [https://try.elevenlabs.io/earn-with-voice-clones](https://try.elevenlabs.io/earn-with-voice-clones)\n\nIt takes you straight to the pricing page where you can grab 50% off your first month. If this guide saves you from the 13 months of trial and error it took me to figure all this out, using the link is an easy way to say thanks. I get a small kickback at no extra cost to you.\n\n**Important:** You need the Creator Plan (minimum $22/month after month 1) to create Professional Voice Clones. ElevenLabs has a free tier and a Starter Plan, but unfortunately you can't create Professional voice clones with either of them.\n\nAlso, here's something most guides don't mention: **Each Creator Plan account only allows ONE Professional Voice Clone.**\n\nThey offer a Business plan which allows up to 3 Professional Voice Clones, but they charge $1,320/month for that… ridiculous. I know.\n\nSo, if you want to build a portfolio like I did (which I highly recommend), you'll need to create multiple accounts. Each account is $22/month with the Creator Plan, but even a mediocre voice should earn enough to cover that cost within a few weeks. My worst-performing voice still makes ~$16/month, and most of mine pay for themselves many times over.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: The Most Important Part: Record Your Audio\n\nYou need at least 30 minutes of clean, high-quality audio. But here's what nobody tells you:\n\n**What you record matters as much as how you record it.**\n\nThe AI learns your voice patterns, inflections, and style from your recording. If you record yourself reading a novel in a calm, steady narration voice, your clone will sound great for audiobooks but weird for energetic social media content.\n\n**Match your recording to your intended use case:**\n\n| If you want your voice used for... | Record yourself... |\n|---|---|\n| Audiobooks / Narration | Reading fiction or non-fiction passages |\n| Podcasts | Having a conversational monologue |\n| Meditation / Relaxation | Speaking slowly and soothingly |\n| YouTube explainers | Explaining topics in an engaging way |\n| Character voices | Doing the character consistently |\n\n**Recording Tips:**\n\n1. **Stay consistent.** Same mic position, same distance, same room, same energy level throughout.\n2. **Avoid mouth sounds.** Stay hydrated. Do a few takes if you get clicky mouth sounds.\n3. **Leave room tone.** Record 10 seconds of silence (just the room) at the start. This helps with noise removal later.\n4. **Don't over-edit.** Light noise removal is fine, but heavy processing can confuse the AI. Keep it natural.\n5. **Aim for -6dB to -3dB peaks.** Not too quiet, not clipping. Audacity has a great normalizing feature for this.\n6. **Record more than 30 minutes.** I usually aim for 45-60 minutes of raw audio, which gives me 30+ minutes of clean, edited content.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Create Your Professional Voice Clone\n\nOnce you have your audio files ready:\n\n1. Click \"Voices\" in the left sidebar\n2. Click \"Create or Clone a Voice\"\n3. Select \"Professional Voice Clone\"\n4. Accept the terms\n\nNow you'll need to:\n\n**Name your voice.** Pick something memorable and fitting. \"Calm Sarah\" or \"Energetic Mike\" tells users what to expect better than \"Voice\\_Final\\_v2.\"\n\n**Write a description.** Be specific about what your voice is good for. Example: \"A warm, friendly American male voice perfect for explainer videos, podcasts, and corporate narration. Clear articulation with a conversational tone.\"\n\n**Add tags.** These are crucial for discoverability. Just click through the dropdowns to find the most relevant options for your voice.\n\n**Upload your audio.** You can upload multiple files. Make sure they total at least 30 minutes.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Verify Your Voice\n\nElevenLabs requires voice verification to prove you're uploading your own voice (not stealing someone else's).\n\n**Here's how it works:**\n\n1. ElevenLabs generates a random sentence\n2. You record yourself reading it\n3. Their AI compares your verification recording to your uploaded audio\n4. If they match, you're verified\n\nThis is where most people mess up. The verification is picky. Here's how to pass it on the first try:\n\n* **Do it right after recording.** Stuff like humidity, sleep, or too much coffee can change your voice tone just enough to mess up the verification.\n* **Use the exact same setup.** Same mic, same room, same distance, same position.\n* **Match your energy.** If your uploaded audio was calm, verify calmly. If it was energetic, bring that energy.\n* **You only get a few attempts.** Too many failures and you'll get locked out temporarily.\n\n**Pro tip:** If you're using audio processing (EQ, compression, etc.) on your uploaded recordings, you'll want that same processing on your verification recording.\n\nI use a free tool called BlackHole (Mac) to route my DAW's processed output back into the verification recording. This way, my verification sounds identical to my uploaded audio. If you're on Windows, VoiceMeeter does the same thing.\n\nOnce submitted, the voice takes 2-6 hours to process. You'll get an email when it's ready.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Create a Killer Voice Preview\n\nThis is your sales pitch. When users browse the Voice Library, they'll hear a short preview of each voice. You want yours to stand out.\n\n1. Go to Voices → My Voices\n2. Click the \"a\" icon to generate speech with your voice\n3. Create a preview that's 70-150 characters (aim for close to 150)\n\n**Two approaches:**\n\n**Option A: Speak directly to the listener**\n\n\"Hey there! I'm Jake, and I'm here to make your content sound amazing. Whether it's a podcast, YouTube video, or audiobook, let's create something great together.\"\n\n**Option B: Demonstrate your voice's purpose**\n\n\"The morning mist rolled across the valley as she opened the letter, her hands trembling with anticipation. Today would change everything.\"\n\n**Dial in the settings:**\n\nPlay with the sliders (speed, stability, exaggeration) and generate multiple versions until you get one that sounds natural and represents your voice well.\n\n**Important:** As of now, you can only use V2 voice models for previews. I've had the best results with \"Eleven Multilingual v2.\" I think it sounds closest to the original voice.\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Publish to the Voice Library\n\nTime to go live:\n\n1. Click the three dots (⋮) next to your voice\n2. Click \"Share voice\"\n3. Toggle \"Sharing\" to ON\n4. Toggle \"Publish to the Voice Library\" to ON\n\n**Note:** If you use a VPN, turn it off for this step. The sharing toggle sometimes doesn't appear with VPNs enabled. Weird bug, but it got me stuck for an hour.\n\n**Settings to configure:**\n\n* **Live moderation** prevents your voice from being used for adult content. Disabling it maximizes earnings potential (more users can access your voice), but it's a personal choice.\n* **Custom Voice Preview** is where you select your best generation from Step 5.\n* **Notice Period** determines how long existing users can keep using your voice after you remove it. Longer notice periods mean higher revenue share. I recommend 6 months or more.\n* **Submit your voice name.** Follow ElevenLabs' naming format. You can't change this later, so make it count.\n\nAfter submission, a human (I think) reviews your voice. During business hours, approval usually takes less than 24 hours. Weekend submissions might wait until Monday.\n\n---\n\n## Step 7: Set Up Payouts\n\nYou need to connect a bank account to get paid:\n\n1. Click your profile picture (top right)\n2. Click \"Payouts\"\n3. Click \"Create payout account\"\n4. Follow the prompts to set up Stripe Express\n\nPayouts happen weekly. You can watch your earnings accumulate in real-time on the Payouts page.\n\n**Tax note for US folks:** ElevenLabs doesn't withhold taxes. They'll send you a 1099-MISC at year end. Set aside money for taxes. I put away about 25-30% of my voice earnings just to be safe. You can also write off the subscription fees as a deduction, so make sure to keep receipts!\n\n---\n\n## The Strategy That 10x'd My Earnings\n\nOkay, you've got one voice live. Here's how to actually make real money:\n\n**Build a Portfolio**\n\nOne voice is a lottery ticket. A portfolio is a strategy.\n\nMy 8 voices span different categories:\n\n* Meditation / Calm (my top earner at ~$309/month)\n* Narration (2 voices, ~$120/month combined)\n* Conversational / Podcast (~$110/month)\n* Character voices (~$100/month)\n* ASMR (2 newer voices, too early to judge)\n\n**Why multiple voices?**\n\n* Different users search for different things. Your voice might be perfect for multiple categories, but each voice can only have one primary category.\n* Hedges your bets. If one voice flops, others might carry you.\n* Compounds over time. 8 voices earning $100/month beats 1 voice earning $300/month.\n\n**\"But I only have one voice!\"**\n\nNo, you have many. Try:\n\n* Different pitch ranges (speak higher, speak lower)\n* Different energy levels (calm vs. energetic)\n* Different speeds (slow and deliberate vs. quick and punchy)\n* Different personas (professional vs. casual vs. warm vs. authoritative)\n* Character voices if you can do them\n\nEach variation = new voice = new account = new income stream.\n\n**Reverse-Engineer What Works**\n\nBefore creating a new voice, I research:\n\n1. Go to the Voice Library \"Explore\" tab\n2. Search keywords for your intended niche (e.g., \"meditation,\" \"podcast,\" \"narration\")\n3. Look at the top-performing voices\n4. Study their names, descriptions, tags, and previews\n5. Note what they're doing well\n\nAsk yourself:\n\n* What keywords are they using?\n* How do they describe the voice?\n* What does their preview say/do?\n* Is this niche saturated or underserved?\n\nThen create a voice that fits the proven formula while adding your own twist. Don't copy, but definitely learn from winners.\n\n**Optimize Everything**\n\n* **Tags matter.** Use all the relevant ones. Think about what users would search.\n* **Description matters.** Be specific and benefit-focused.\n* **Preview matters.** Make those 150 characters count.\n* **Voice quality matters.** Better recordings = better clones = more usage.\n\n---\n\n## Realistic Expectations\n\nLet me be honest about what to expect:\n\n**Month 1:** You'll probably make somewhere between $10-50. Don't be discouraged. The algorithm needs time to surface your voice to users.\n\n**Months 2-3:** If your voice is decent and well-tagged, you should see growth. $50-150/month is reasonable.\n\n**Months 4+:** Things stabilize. You'll have a sense of whether a voice is a winner or underperformer.\n\n**My portfolio breakdown:**\n\n| Tier | Voices | Avg Monthly | % of Revenue |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Top performer (&gt;$250/mo) | 1 | $309 | 27% |\n| Strong ($100-150/mo) | 3 | $111 | 36% |\n| Moderate ($50-100/mo) | 1 | ~$100 | 9% |\n| Underperforming (&lt;$50/mo) | 1 | $16 | 1% |\n| Too new to judge | 2 | TBD | - |\n\nNot every voice will be a home run. That's fine. The portfolio approach smooths out the variance.\n\n---\n\n## Common Questions\n\n**Do I need professional audio experience?**\n\nNo. I have it, and it helps, but I've seen people with basic setups do well. Clean audio in a quiet room matters more than expensive gear.\n\n**How much time does this take?**\n\nUpfront: Maybe 2-5 hours per voice (recording, editing, uploading, optimizing). Ongoing: Almost none. I check my stats (and bank account) every few weeks. It's genuinely passive.\n\n**Is the market saturated?**\n\nThere are a lot of voices, but demand is growing fast. The key is finding your niche. Generic \"male narrator\" is crowded. \"Soothing meditation guide\" or \"energetic Gen-Z explainer\" is less so.\n\n**Can I do this outside the US?**\n\nYes! ElevenLabs pays creators worldwide via Stripe. Tax implications vary by country, so check your local laws.\n\n**What if my voice gets rejected?**\n\nMake sure your audio quality is good and your verification matches your uploaded content. I've never had a rejection, so I can't speak to the appeals process.\n\n---\n\n## Quick-Start Checklist\n\nIf you want to get started today:\n\n* Sign up for ElevenLabs Creator Plan\n* Set up your recording space (quiet room, mic, software)\n* Record 30-45 minutes of audio (match your intended use case)\n* Edit lightly (remove mistakes, normalize levels)\n* Create Professional Voice Clone\n* Pass verification (same setup as recording!)\n* Generate preview (max 150 characters)\n* Publish to Voice Library\n* Set up Stripe payouts\n* Repeat with new voices to build portfolio\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThis isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. It took me 13 months to get to $1,160/month, and I put real effort into building and optimizing my portfolio.\n\nBut here's what I love about it:\n\n* **It's genuinely passive.** I haven't touched most of my voices in months.\n* **It scales.** More voices means more income streams.\n* **Low startup cost.** $11 for your first month, basic mic, free software.\n* **Growing market.** AI voice usage is exploding.\n\n**Ready to start building your voice portfolio?** Here's my affiliate link: [https://try.elevenlabs.io/earn-with-voice-clones](https://try.elevenlabs.io/earn-with-voice-clones)\n\nYou get 50% off your first month and everything I learned in 13 months about turning this into $1k+/month.

Probably should've made that clearer upfront. Click the link and scroll down to the Appendix (page 4) for screenshots of my actual earnings.\n\n[Report and Payout Screenshots Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QpjMjdh4MU4vIadC6ZjSYqKWwhF4Puf2/view?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm also not the only one doing this. u/liam_in_a_bubble mentioned in the comments they've made over $2k from a single voice. The opportunity is real.\n\nI uploaded two new voices this week. Within a few days, they've each made around $15, already covering the subscription cost. I'll post screenshots once they get their first payouts.\n\nA few people asked about voice ownership: You retain rights to your voice and can remove it anytime with the notice period you set. I've read through the TOS and feel good about it, but worth reviewing yourself before diving in.\n\nQuick update: 21 people have signed up through my link so far. Good for you! If any of you are working through the setup and get stuck, especially on verification or keywords, drop a comment. Happy to help.",

          "body": "Solid write-up overall very thorough 👍  \nA couple things that might help people not overthink it:  \nThe barrier to entry is still low. A couple hundred bucks a month is very doable *right now*, even without pro audio experience. That said, more people are catching on, so this probably won’t be wide open forever.  \nPeople tend to overcomplicate the setup. At its core it’s really just:\n\n1. Sign up for [Elevenlabs](https://share.google/YX0r067VkJEGa0KHz)\n2. Choose the Creator Plan\n3. Upload a clean voice sample (30 mins minimum — honestly 2–3 hours is even better)\n4. Pass the voice captcha (verification)\n5. Toggle Shared + Discovery in Voice Library\n6. Wait \\~1–2 days for approval\n\nYou’re basically licensing your voice like a voice actor. Users grab your voice for audiobooks, YouTube shorts, explainers, etc., and you get paid every time it’s used. No outreach, no client management.  \nCharacterization matters more than people realize. Slight pitch, pacing, or energy changes can make the same voice feel totally different  and those variations often perform better than a generic “narrator” voice.\n\nAlso appreciate you being upfront about expectations and portfolio strategy that’s where most people go wrong thinking one voice is enough for $1000/month.",

      "selftext": "Four months ago I saw those accounts reading AITA stories getting millions of views. I was like fuck it I'll try.\n\nFirst 10 videos were complete trash. Just my voice over text on screen. Maybe 300 views each. I was ready to delete the whole account.\n\nThen I noticed something. The accounts that were actually blowing up all had a person on screen. Not a real person, like some AI thing. I figured maybe that's what I was missing.\n\nStarted using ElevenLabs for voice cause I sound terrible on recordings. For the avatar I use APOB, edit everything in CapCut. Took forever to figure out but got something that works.\n\nFirst video with an actual face on screen got 4,800 views. I almost shit myself. Next one got 8,000. Then one randomly blew up to 35k and I thought I figured it out.\n\nI didn't figure it out.\n\nIt's been a couple months since then and I still have no idea what makes a video work. Some get 5k views. Some get 60k. One hit 240k and I tried to recreate it like 10 times. Nothing. The algorithm makes no sense.\n\nRight now I'm at:\n\n\\- 2-3 videos a day (used to do 4 but I was losing my mind)\n\n\\- 25k to 40k views per video on average but it's all over the place\n\n\\- 30-40 minutes per video, finding stories takes the longest\n\n\\- Making around $700/month total between TikTok and brand deals\n\nThe process is pretty simple. Find a story on Reddit, usually AITA cause those perform the best. Relationship advice is hit or miss. Edit it down cause people's attention span is like 5 seconds. Generate the voice, make the avatar talk, edit in CapCut, add subtitles cause nobody watches with sound apparently, post around 7pm.\n\nCosts:\n\nAPOB: $14/month\n\nElevenLabs: $22/month\n\nCapCut Pro: $10/month\n\nTotal: $46/month\n\nNot bad but it adds up.\n\nMost of my income comes from brand deals honestly. TikTok payments are inconsistent as hell. Some months it's $200, some months $400. Brand deals are more reliable, usually $300-400/month.\n\nHere's where I'm stuck.\n\nOne, I'm running out of good stories. I've gone through every top post on AITA from the last year. Now I'm scraping through random subreddits and most of it's garbage. Where do you even find good stories at this point? I tried confession and tifu but they don't hit the same.\n\nTwo, my views have been dropping for like 3 weeks straight. I don't know if TikTok changed something or people are just tired of this content. Some days I post 3 videos and they all die under 10k. It's frustrating as hell.\n\nThree, last week someone commented \"isn't this just stealing people's stories\" and now I can't stop thinking about it. I put credit in the description but I honestly don't know if that's enough. I've seen some accounts get taken down. Is this even legal? Like technically it's public content but I'm making money off it so I don't know.\n\nFour, the avatar looks weird sometimes. Especially the hands. I've had people call it out in comments. I don't know if I should try to fix it or just ignore it cause most people don't seem to care.\n\nOne video I did about this wedding drama where the bride uninvited her sister got 240k views. People were in the comments arguing for DAYS about who was wrong. That's when I realized controversy is everything. But I can't predict what's gonna be controversial.\n\nMy girlfriend thinks this whole thing is dumb but she can't argue with the extra $700 lmao.\n\nI want to keep doing this cause the money helps but I feel like I'm one algorithm change away from this whole thing disappearing.\n\nHas anyone else done something like this? How do you deal with views randomly dropping?\n\nAlso where do you find content when you've burned through the obvious stuff?\n\nAnd does anyone actually know the legal situation with using Reddit posts? I keep seeing different answers.\n\nI'm probably overthinking all of this but yeah. That's where I'm at.",

I got into drones about 2 years ago just for fun, mostly filming my weekend hikes and local spots around Portland. Posted some clips on instagram and this small real estate agency hit me up asking if they could use one of my neighborhood shots for a listing. I said sure and charged them like $50 thinking that was fair\n\nfast forward and now i have 6 local businesses (3 realtors, a wedding venue, and 2 small hotels) that have me on retainer for $150-300/month each. Theyre basically paying for access to my footage library that i keep updating. I spend maybe 4-5 hours a month flying around getting new stuff and the rest is just them downloading whatever they need from the shared drive I set up\n\nthe best part is i was gonna do this hobby anyway. I had some money saved up for a better drone and just reinvested the first payments into upgrading my equipment instead. now its covering itself plus giving me around $1200-1400 extra monthly without much effort",

So I would never suggest Etsy. It's also fickle, so I'd be in trouble if I depended on that alone. I have a 9-5 that is dependable. \n\nMy point is an actual job is going to make you income to support yourself while you find a side hustle to begin. Most side hustles are on the side because they don't give real pay the rent/mortgage type money. And all of them take a bit of time to develop.\n\nMy 'side hustles' that are fairly passive are things like Fetch Rewards and Evidation where you get points to exchange for gift cards. It isn't quick or steady money. \n\nThat's the biggest trouble with side hustles or working in ecommerce, you never know how much you will earn at any given time. It depends on trends, economy, how you present yourself/product, and how big of a social media following you can gain. \n\nI only mention all this because if you need the money to pay your bills, this isn't something to start now.",

Pinterest works especially well because content can drive traffic for months instead of days.\n\nDigital products are another good route if you have any knowledge or experience you can package into templates, guides, or simple resources. You create it once and sell it repeatedly.\n\nIf income is urgent, pairing something faster (freelance, VA work, local services) with a longer-term online strategy can take pressure off! \n\nWhatever you choose, I’d avoid anything promising “quick passive income.” The legit stuff usually takes effort upfront, but it does compound over time.\nAlways open to chat more!",

It’s pretty easy to outsource to other people over time, and it’s less physically demanding than other forms of care work.\n\nAnother example would be party rentals. I saw a post on Reddit today (not sure which sub fortunately) of someone who rents out a large, ‘throne’ style chair for photo shoots at birthdays and baby showers.\n\nIt’s bulky and expensive enough to deter people from buying their own, and the OP was able to undercut their local competitors (ie lower rental and free delivery within a certain area). \n\nAlternatively I would try to leverage a niche skill that has local demand. I have a family friend who rents out enormous cooking pots to members of his community to cater weddings and celebrations. Commercial rental companies don’t stock the style of pots needed by his community, and they can’t guarantee that their equipment has only been used to prepare specific types of food. He runs the business out of his garage and it’s about as close to passive as you can get (ie customers pick up and drop off, pay online).",

I sell Canva and Notion templates on Etsy, Gumroad, and Creative Market.\n\nFirst 3 months were rough, made like $300 total. I was creating stuff I liked instead of what people actually wanted. Game changer was looking at what people searched for on Etsy and Pinterest.\n\nWhat worked:\n\nBundles sell way better than single products. A $27 bundle moves faster than a $7 template even though they take the same time to make.\n\nEtsy SEO isn’t optional. Boring but necessary if you want to be found.\n\nQuality over quantity. 10 good products beat 50 mediocre ones.\n\nWhat didn’t work:\n\nPinterest ads (wasted $200), daily Instagram posting (low conversions), lowering prices (attracts problem customers).\n\nNovember breakdown: $1,840 Etsy, $780 Gumroad, $420 Creative Market.\n\nStill takes about 10 hours a week for customer service and new uploads.

I’m aware of Gumroad, but from a consumer standpoint, do everyday people who purchase digital goods actually go to Gumroad directly? Are they aware of the site and what it’s for?\n\nFrom a creator’s point of view, when I think of Gumroad, I think of it like other platforms where sellers list products, similar to Etsy. But I’m trying to look at it from a user’s perspective. Do people actually go to Gumroad and search for things, or is it mostly your job as the creator to bring in the traffic?\n\nI’m not saying this to be lazy I’m just genuinely curious. If you’re not actively driving traffic, do people actually browse Gumroad from time to time on their own?",

There are definitely some glaring issues, but I'll continue bug fixing as I go along.\n\nOne interesting thing I noticed is that the bot actually takes less trades &amp; i think its due to the lack of that human element. The bot doesn't get those \"gut feelings\" it sticks strictly to its data &amp; parameters. This isn't a bad thing, but there were a few instances the bot ignored while adhering to parameters, that I would have jumped at.\n\nI'm not sure I can code \"emotion\" on the bot &amp; I think doing so may ruin its edge. This is all ramble anyway as I don't have nearly enough data to make a conclusion. Maybe I'll do another update in 3 months to determine idk.\n\nOn my last post there were some of you who asked how I built it, mine is custom coded, but I did say I'll try to find a no code alternative for you guys.\n\nI did find one &amp; took the liberty to try to build out as much of the workflow as I could. Before I dive into it let me just say that if you really want to make custom workflows, learn to code. It was actually harder ( for me ) to build this cause these no code editors have quite a few constraints you don't get coding.\n\n[Regardless here is the workflow](https://www.gumloop.com/pipeline?workbook_id=fn8cXAevPdxcJLPoMyuTfy). I forgot to add a trigger, but in my defense the entire thing was pissing me off so i could focus. ( don't bully me please )\n\nDO NOT under any circumstance use the stupid Ai chat builder thing, i think gummie is the name. It will break the entire workflow. You are better off experimenting &amp; trying different things yourself. Also I'm sharing this workflow as I'm sure one of y'all can improve it &amp; make it infinitely better than I can.  \n  \nHopefully I've covered everything, if not, if I make an update to the update then I'll cover anything I may have left out. As usual feel free to ask any questions. ",

It’s a skill.\n\nA lot of people jump into affiliate marketing thinking it’s just dropping links and waiting to get paid. That’s not how it works.\n\nAffiliate marketing is simple:\n\nYou recommend something. Someone buys. You earn a commission.\n\nThe hard part? Getting the right people to see it.\n\nMost beginners fail because they focus on links instead of learning how to attract attention, explain value, and build trust. Random links in random places don’t convert.\n\nYou don’t need a big following or fancy tools. You do need consistency, patience, and a willingness to learn what actually works.\n\nIt’s remote-friendly, beginner-friendly, and legit, but it’s not passive in the beginning. Think effort first, results later.\n\nTreat it like a real skill, not a shortcut, and it can work.\n\nHope this helps someone avoid wasting time.",

          "body": "This is a really honest question, and it’s good you’re asking it *now* instead of blindly copying whatever’s trending.\n\nI’ll be straight with you, but gently. Most people talking about “digital products + affiliate income” online are either very early, very lucky, or leaving out a lot of context. Consistent income does exist, but it’s usually way smaller and slower at the beginning than TikTok or Twitter makes it look. Think months of nothing, then maybe a few hundred, then gradual growth if you don’t quit.\n\nWhere people get stuck is starting with *vibes* instead of value. “Personal growth, life, mindset” sounds nice, but it’s incredibly hard to monetize unless you already have lived experience people trust or a very specific angle. At 20, that doesn’t mean you can’t do it, but it does mean you’ll need patience and humility. Most people don’t follow accounts for motivation, they follow because something consistently helps them think or act differently.\n\nA better way to think about starting is: who do I want to help, and with what very specific problem? Content works best when it’s tied to something practical, even if it’s small. Studying better, learning a skill faster, navigating early career mistakes, building discipline, saving money, learning a tool. Clarity beats inspiration every time.\n\nMonetization usually comes later and more indirectly than people admit. Affiliates work when you’re already using and recommending tools naturally. Digital products work when you’ve solved a problem enough times that packaging the solution makes sense. Most people don’t “decide” to monetize — it happens because people start asking for more.\n\nAt your age, the biggest win isn’t quick side income, it’s building skills and credibility in public. Content can be part of that, but it shouldn’t be the whole plan. Learn something real, document the process honestly, help others who are one or two steps behind you. That compounds way better than chasing funnels and links.\n\nIf you start with curiosity, consistency, and actually being useful, money becomes a byproduct. If you start with money as the main goal, burnout usually shows up first. You’re early. That’s an advantage, not a disadvantage.",

          "body": "I didn’t start with content creation or personal growth. I started with high intent audiences. In the UK I noticed soccer tipsters running £10 to £1,000 challenges and daily picks on Facebook and Twitter. Every post had hundreds of people emotionally invested in the next bet. These people already had bookmaker accounts and were actively trying to make money.\n\nInstead of competing with tipsters, I targeted their audience. I explained, using basic maths, why long term tipping is mathematically impossible for most people. I shared expected value, variance, and why chasing picks fails. I also drip fed examples of value betting where odds were longer than the implied probability, which built credibility fast.\n\nOnce people trusted the logic, I introduced matched betting as a risk free way to convert bookmaker bonuses into cash. Because the audience was already high intent, conversions were strong. Even after 9 years, my conversion rate has never dropped below 20%.\n\nA few years later I immigrated to the east coast of the US. By then I had long standing affiliate relationships with UK brands, and when those operators launched in the US , the partnerships carried over. The same model worked even better in the US because incentives were larger and the concept was brand new to the market, only available since 2018. \n\nToday it’s essentially passive. The content runs itself, the funnels are mature, and I don’t actively sell. I even have a QR code magnet on my truck that links to a simple explainer with my affiliate tracking embedded. It still converts because it meets people at the right moment with the right message.",

      "selftext": "\n\nNot a huge number compared to some posts here, but it’s a personal milestone so I wanted to share what actually worked.\n\nI started about 8 months ago after losing my job. I sell Canva and Notion templates on Etsy, Gumroad and on my website bought via a [portal](https://sitefy.co/product/digital-products-website-to-sell-digital-downloads-online/).\n\nThe first 3 months were rough. I made around $400 total. Biggest mistake was creating things I liked instead of what people were actively searching for. Things changed once I started researching Etsy search terms and Pinterest trends.\n\nWhat worked:\n\n• Bundles sell much better than single products. A $27 bundle moves faster than a $7 template, even though both take similar effort.\n• Etsy SEO is not optional. It’s boring, but it’s the difference between zero views and consistent sales.\n• Quality over quantity. 10 solid products outperform 50 average ones.\n\nWhat didn’t work:\n\n• Pinterest ads. Lost about $200 with almost no return.\n• Daily Instagram posting. Lots of effort, very low conversions.\n• Lowering prices. It didn’t increase volume and just brought more support issues.\n\nNovember breakdown:\n• Etsy: $678\n• Gumroad: 228$\n• Creative Market: $42\n\nI still spend around 10 hours a week on customer support and uploading new products, so it’s not truly passive. But it beats going back to a 9–5.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone’s curious.",

      "selftext": "Quick background: Started a niche site in September 2025 in a moderately competitive space (home office equipment reviews). This is my third site but the first where I'm seriously experimenting with social media as a traffic/authority driver alongside traditional SEO.\n\n\n\nWanted to share what I've learned so far about using social signals to help a new site gain traction faster.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The theory I'm testing:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nGoogle's helpful content update seemed to emphasize \"real\" sites with actual audiences vs pure SEO plays. My hypothesis: if I can build genuine social engagement around my content, it might send positive signals that help with indexing and initial rankings.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What I set up:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Created accounts on IG, TikTok, Pinterest, and YouTube Shorts\n\n\\- Each piece of content I publish gets repurposed into short-form social content\n\n\\- Goal: drive some initial traffic + build \"brand signals\" that Google might pick up\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The problem I ran into:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nStarting from zero followers on every platform meant my content was basically invisible. Even good stuff got like 50 views max. The chicken-and-egg problem is real.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What I tried:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Pure organic grinding\\*\\* (first 6 weeks): Posted consistently, engaged with others, used trending sounds/hashtags. Result: painfully slow. Got to maybe 200 followers across all platforms.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Engagement pods\\*\\* (weeks 7-8): Joined a few Discord groups for mutual engagement. Result: felt fake, took way too much time, and the engagement didn't seem to help reach.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Small paid boosts\\*\\* (weeks 9-12): Used a combination of platform ads and an SMM service (Crescitaly - it's an Italian panel that delivers pretty realistic-looking engagement). I'd give new posts a small push of 100-200 likes/views to help them get initial traction.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Results so far (Month 4):\\*\\*\n\n\n\n| Metric | Month 1 | Month 4 |\n\n|--------|---------|----------|\n\n| Social followers (total) | 200 | 2,400 |\n\n| Monthly social referral traffic | \\~50 | \\~800 |\n\n| Indexed pages | 8 | 34 |\n\n| Organic traffic | 0 | \\~150/day |\n\n| DR (Ahrefs) | 0 | 8 |\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What I think is happening:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nThe social traffic, even though it's small, seems to be sending positive signals. Pages that get social shares tend to get indexed faster. I also noticed a few natural backlinks coming from people who found my content through social.\n\n\n\nThe SMM boosts didn't directly help SEO (obviously), but they helped my social content get seen by real people who then engaged organically. It's like using a small paid push to unlock organic distribution.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What flopped:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Pinterest: Took way more effort than expected for minimal return\n\n\\- Trying to grow all platforms equally: Should have focused on 1-2\n\n\\- Over-boosting: When I tried larger boosts (500+ likes), the engagement looked suspicious and didn't convert to real followers\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Questions for the community:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. Anyone else experimenting with social as part of their niche site strategy? What's working for you?\n\n\n\n2. Do you think Google actually factors in social signals, or am I just getting lucky with timing?\n\n\n\n3. For those further along: did early social investment pay off long-term, or is it just a distraction from content/links?\n\n\n\n4. Is there an ethical line with using paid boosts to kickstart social? I go back and forth on this.\n\n\n\nHappy to share more details if anyone's interested. Still very much learning but wanted to document the journey.",

But the thing that got me was how many other older people in her neighborhood were in the same boat but had no one to help them.\n\nThese weren't your typical \"hire a junk removal service\" situations. These folks needed someone patient who understood that every item has a story and you cant just toss everything. They also needed help deciding what actually has value vs what doesn't, how to sell stuff on facebook marketplace (most of them have no clue), and someone to physically do the heavy lifting.\n\nStarted offering this super specific service in my area. \"Downsizing assistance for seniors\" basically. I help them sort, list valuable items online, coordinate donations, and handle the actual cleanout. Charged $35/hour which felt fair and I had a little money saved up so I could test it without stressing about immediate income.\n\nFirst client came from my moms friend. Then word of mouth exploded because apparently every boomer in a 10 mile radius is dealing with this. Now I'm booked 3 weeks out and averaging around $4k/month working maybe 20 hours a week. The crazy part is how many of their kids are willing to pay me to do this because they either live far away or dont have the patience.\n\nIm wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?",

When I sold my Grandma's house in 2016, I went down there for a week and loaded up a trailer with the valuable items or things I thought I'd use at home. The rest of the house was evacuated by a team of some 5 laborers who bagged/boxed up clothes, linens, books, etc and brought them to their warehouse. It took them maybe half a day to tie up loose ends. From there, the business model was simple. Once a month, this business would hold a public auction that went from like 7am till 9pm. Lots of similar items from different estates would be placed in this enormous warehouse/outdoor space and people would come through and make offers on items (or just buy outright for a fixed price). Throughout the day, at different time checkpoints, the price would be reduced by 25% until the last few hours of the day it would be 75% off. At the end of the day, all unsold goods were landfilled or donated. \n\nIn terms of making money, the contract was set up where I owed the company $1,000 no matter what and 25% of net revenue of sold goods. They ended up getting around $3,000 for the miscellanea of her house so I only owed $250 above what they got from the sale. They also set me up with a contractor/realtor to get the house minimally ready for sale.\n\nI'm not saying you need to scale it that large, but that's how that company was able to provide families with some peace of mind that the entire house wasn't just going in the trash.",

You operate in a unique space of being able to come from outside and handle the downsizing/listing of items. For example, if you, a stranger/expert come and tell them that this item should be listed and is worth ~$20, they might accept your word for it while if their son or daughter comes and says the same thing, they might argue and tell them they're wrong. \n\nI deal with the same thing with my family all the time. I did my degree in computer science and economics. I work in tech. My parents are academics (researchers at a uni). They will argue with me till they're blue in the face about systems I've literally worked on because I'll always be their son and kid in their head, but if one of my colleagues said the same thing as me, they'd accept it as expert testimony.\n\n&gt; Im wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?\n\nI mean, it's a specialist version but you have a lot of parallels. You should think about what exactly makes up the core parts of your profession and how it differs from other similar, overlapping industry professions. From there, you can figure out a)where to hire from, b) how to hire, c) what needs to be taught, and d) how you continue to refine that niche. It can totally scale. (and as others have said, $35 an hour is less than what I pay just for regular cleaning ladies to come dust my place every week lol. You also have to keep in mind if you take outside help, your prices need to scale so you make your cut and can also handle other things like equipment, liability, etc.. At least in LA, I pay $50 an hour pp (e.g. $200 for 2 hours with a crew of 2) and that feels fairly standard/not the lowest budget but certainly not high end. So yeah, $35 for specialist help? Not surprised to hear that it's popular).",

Credit card saved for processing and if you bid and won, it was yours.\n\nIf I recall correctly, you had to agree that you could pick up the goods on the specified pickup date during a set of hours. This allowed the company to arrange all pick ups of goods from the house on one single day. They'd only have to worry about what didn't sell.\n\nIf a customer didn't make it to pickup between the set hours on the pickup date, the goods went to second place in the auction for an arranged day, and you were charged anyway.\n\nI think each lot had an easy minimum set, like that Sports Stuff example would start at like $6.\n\nWas pretty awesome.",

Give up or try again.\n\nLife is a culmination of choices. Over a lifetime you will have thousands of them. They will determine what you have, what you do, and who you are.\n\nWant a life with freedom, money and no regrets? Get back up when you feel knocked down.

      "selftext": "Started flipping luxury watches about a year and half ago. I started with 25k of my own capital from my day job. Eventually I put in up to about \\~70k of my own funds (owners capital) to grow the business. I started with no funding, no mentor, no one in the business and no courses. Lost 2k on my first 2 watches in 2024. Lost another 8k later that year. I mostly sell Rolexes and luxury brands. Nothing under 1k. Average watch price is around 10k.\n\n2024 - First 6 months:\n\n\\- 561k in sales\n\n\\- 22k gross profit\n\n\\- 13k net profit\n\n2025 - One year:\n\n\\- 1.2m in sales\n\n\\- 87k gross profit\n\n\\- 63k net profit\n\n\\- \\~8k payroll (salary to myself)\n\nIve been wholesaling pretty much everything. Fast flips. I aim for 6-12% margins, depending on how long I’m holding a watch. I’ve lost a few times, can count on one hand probably. I’m trying to get to a point where I’m making a consistent 10k / month net, after all expenses including my salary of 1k / month.\n\nI do some social media / marketing but very little. Trying to really focus on that this year so I can sell to more retail clients for a healthier margin. As well as buy more watches from retail clients.\n\nIt’s been really fun and I love watches and enjoy getting to wear them while I try to sell them. I still have my day job and don’t think I’m going to quit anytime soon.\n\nJust wanted to share this. If I missed anything or any questions just ask below. I’m going to try to post regular updates to track my progress and engage with others as I have never done it before. \n\nThanks!",

It can always work better faster, harder later.\n\nI stocked up a war chest for almost nine years.In my business. I just mastered the mundane and kept doing what was working.And didn't get fancy.\n\nWhen the new trump trade war started, I was able to drop a massive amount of capital on massive amount of inventory and avoid our tariffs jumping from the 25% we had been paying since 2018, to 100-150%.\n\nThis allowed us to keep our pricing the same. Last year, one of the other two manufacturers that supply our niche of commercial truck parts globally was absorbed by the other. Both were already 50% more expensive than we are, even though we have twice the profit margins. Once they completed the buyout, the company raised its prices another thirty to forty five percent!\n\nWe gained 127 new customers the first month after the buyout. For the last three months, we have seen double digit new customers coming on board. \n\nThe company that bought our other competitor is bleeding customers for this niche every day.\n\nWe recouped every dollar that we spent though.We did burn through what was supposed to be 24 months of inventory in just over 12. We have the cash flow, though, and we've already got 2 more inventory orders on the water that should arrive any day. Today I had five new customers.Come on board that were bleeding off of the competitor. \n\nWe did our first price increase in ten years on january first for 7%. We still dominate our market in pricing. And quality, and we still have almost 80% net profit margins with the new inventory lines coming in.\n\nI'd like biographies. Founder's Podcast is excellent. Many of the old business greats I had one thing in common.And that is, they sat on a mountain of cash.",

The tension between scaling and safety is real though.\n\n\n\nOne thing that helped businesses I know navigate this: automating the processes BEFORE scaling. If you automate your core workflows now, you can actually scale revenue without proportionally scaling headcount or risk.\n\n\n\nThink about it - if you can automate 30-50% of your operational overhead, you can take on 50% more volume without hiring, which means less fixed costs and lower risk while still growing.\n\n\n\nBefore you and your cofounder compromise on strategy, map out which parts of your operation could be automated. That usually gives you a third option: scale with existing team + automation. Gives you growth without the risk exposure you're worried about.\n\n\n\nJust a thought, but it's honestly how a lot of profitable businesses approach scaling without burning cash.",

You earn it by being **relevant**. You have about 7 seconds to prove you aren't a waste of their time.

Just for practicing discipline. \n\nBob shop on fifth street is the best.That's who we send everyone to.\n\n\n*** great, thank you so much for your help.What was your name??***\n\n\nNow I call bob and I say, hey, bob sally over at huville truck repair said that you are the best at doing these repairs.Is that true?\nYes\nAwesome. I'm calling because I just showed them 50-60% saving on the parts you use, and sally said, I'd need to call you. Can I email this over?So when you get a chance, you can look at it later?\n\nYes....\n\nSold.\n\nI don't really give a shit what their name is or what their business name is or what city they're in or where they're located or any of that stuff. My job is to bring value to the marketplace period. It doesn't reward your wants, or needs it only rewards value.\n\nI care about.Do they use the widget that I sell?\n\nI know my widget is higher quality and it's half the price.

Look I hate making these calls as much as you hate getting them, so heres a long story short- We partnered with x up the road, and things went better than anticipated because (insert promo excuse here: over purchased material, surprised by success of new product in this market, im a new rep and im ready to deal to make a name for myself, my boss really wants to break into the area and is giving away the house,  its the end of the quarter and we can make things super easy, this government whatever is doing whatever. Whatever. Just make it real and honest, no marketing coded bullshit). \n\nSo here is my offer- (give actual non vague, highly specific price). Thoughts? \n\nGreat, all I'm looking to do now is send you our standard contract. Once you get that filled out, we can start talking specifics. If it doesn't work out, no worries. I just want something on paper before we get into the nitty gritty so I know you won't (sell my price list, secrets, try to undercut or cut me out, whatever.\"\n\nThen send them some bullshit doc with whatever you two talked about, but no real call to action. Just a \"if I decide to go through this vendor for this item, it will cost this much\". Just something for them to push through legal to get you on the vendor list. Then the real selling starts. Because your already an approved vendor, you cut out a ton of the bullshit. \n\nI sold into Coke, Ford, Ulta, Rivian, CAT, and more in the manufacturing space before moving to Healthcare and using the same script to break into HR departments in Mayo, Brigham, HCA, Kaiser, Providence, and Ascension.",

As with most things in sales, it’s how you say it. \n\nEspecially true with return clients ime, it really makes a huge impact to ask how they are doing using their name, and perhaps something you remember from their last visit. \n\nContext is surely important ofc. A car salesman for instance, will have a much harder time coming across as sincere with small talk pleasantries because the general public don’t trust them and don’t really want or need their middle-man services.

Even a warm phone call, a personal visit, shared routines become the memories that actually last.  \nChasing success for them is beautiful, but don't turn love into a deadline. if they raise someone this driven and this caring, you have already given them proof they disn't fail.\n\nI was in similar boat a while ago, but my oldman gave this advice, and my wife validated the same, now we are in happy space.",

One of the purest motivations is the desire to repay those who have sacrificed for you.  \nHowever, don't wait until you \"make it\" to spend time with them or express your concern. Success isn't only about the major event; it's also about the small things that happen along the route. Give them a call, stop by when you can, and show them that you're trying. That still has significance now.  \nYou already stand out since it's obvious that you don't take things for granted. Continue, but while you're constructing, remember to live in the moment with them.

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’d really appreciate some perspective from founders or people who’ve been through co-founder conflicts.\n\nI’m a technical co-founder (CTO) of a small Swiss startup (GmbH). I built and maintain essentially the entire product, run infrastructure, fix bugs, and handle most customer support. My two co-founders focus on business and sales.\n\nEquity is split 40% / 40% / 20% (me). Originally it was meant to be equal, but it changed at incorporation due to capital contribution issues. I also don’t have sole signature rights.\n\nOver the last months, they:\n\n\\- Excluded me from business meetings\n\n\\- Started discussing decisions privately\n\n\\- Reduced communication\n\n\\- Admitted later they “distanced themselves”\n\nThen they began blaming me for:\n\n\\- Not being involved enough\n\n\\- Not asking about meetings I was excluded from\n\n\\- “Acting like an employee” because I mainly do technical work\n\n\\- Not doing business/sales/networking (which was never my role)\n\nNow one of them gave me an ultimatum:\n\n1. Become an employee and give up founder equity\n2. Leave completely\n\nThey refused my proposal to align expectations or do a measurable performance plan.\n\nThey also said things like:\n\n\\- “We can’t have someone who does nothing and bunkers equity.”\n\n\\- “This is just derisking for us.”\n\n\\- “It’s too late to fix things because there is now distance.”\n\nWe do have a co-founders’ agreement that says:\n\n\\- Equity reflects long-term contribution\n\n\\- Performance issues should go through a written improvement plan with a cure period\n\n\\- Disputes should go through negotiation -&gt; mediation -&gt; arbitration\n\n\\- Vested equity can’t be forced to transfer (5% vested)\n\n\\- Role or equity changes need unanimous consent\n\nThey skipped all of that and went straight to an ultimatum.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\\- Is this a normal “professionalization” move or a co-founder squeeze-out?\n\n\\- Do I actually have leverage here, or will majority control win anyway?\n\n\\- Should I refuse both options and force mediation / legal process?\n\n\\- Is accepting employee status a bad idea long-term?\n\nThanks for any advice.",

Offering a discount if you can showcase the work you do with them to other clients as part of your marketing might make it worthwhile.

There is no rush or time table on whatever you are working on... Just do what you can when you need the distraction. Don't do anything that will require your time, unless you need the distraction, or are sure you unable to be spending it with your loved one. I will share some of my story. I don't know if it will help or not, as I'm still not sure how it turns out....\n\nI quit my job (6-figures) last February to move 200 miles back to my hometown to take care of my father. He was  having a hard time and seemed to be going through early stages of dementia. My Dad in the 8 months before that lost his brother, his wife (step-mom) and his sister. He was best friends with his brother, extremely close to his sister, and married to his wife for over 40 years. The year before we lost his father and the year before that his mother. The lost seemed to take a piece of my Dad's mind each time. But I was just far enough a way to not see it... I talked to him 4 or 5 times a week but he was always according to him doing good. \nMy Dad and I have always been really close and if you ask him, his whole life he was always good, or fine. By the time I got here I instantly knew he wasn't good. It took a few months to find out he had stage 4 lung cancer, that had traveled to his brain, and bones. My Dad who was never sick, never had a surgery, or illness, and was the rock in my life. He was a good man, that was always smiling, and really cared for everyone he ever met. I only saw him mad a few times in my life, and never sad except when we lost loved ones.\nI dropped everything in my life the day he called me to ask if I had talked to his sister, my aunt.. who we lost 6 months before. I literally quit my job as a Program Manager at a Fortune 100 company, packed a suitcase, and drove the 200 miles to his house. I gave everything else I owned away to family and my wife of 30 years that I had recwbtly seperated from. \n\nI came here and since that day I took him to every appointment and treatment, watched him waste away all the way down to 85 lbs after the radiation treatments, cooked his meals 3 times a day that he just couldn't eat eventually, carried him to the bathroom, bathed him, and held his hand when he took his last breath on December 13th 2025. By then I was struggling to feed myself and keep the lights on. I scrapped up just enough to pay for the funeral. Now I have to be out of his home by February 1st and not sure what I'm going to do... probanly sleep in my car. Idk... \nWhatever happens I'm thankful for the time I had.. I'm haunted by it as well. He was who I talked to whenever anything happened in my life. I sometimes would put off something or whatever it was for days before talking to him, because I knew he would tell me the right thing to do.. and that was usually the hard thing I was avoiding. But that was the kind of person he was. He was good. In the 10 months we probably had 5 or 6 people stop by... He didn't want others to know or worry about him.. ever. But over 100 people showed up at his funeral. Many I didn't know. He was truly a great man, quiet, good looking, funny, talented, humble... and really so talented... as an artist, a musician, and really everything, he could literally do everything. The man was amazing and just so so humble. A professional musician his whole life. He could play any instrument since he was 6 years old. Didnt read music, you could just turn on the radio, hand him any instrument and he would start playing along with whatever was playing. He was a studio musician and recorded for a ton of names everyone would know. He was flawless thats why they hired him when making the final cut of a song or album. He also was a  business owner, and so much more. He was just good and I know I'm blessed to have had him as a father.  Sorry for going on. \nI'm still lost, I don't know how to deal with it or anything anymore. \n\nBut if you take anything away from my ramblings, just be thankful for whatever time you have left. Spend as much time as possible with your loved one. Ask them questions, make them tell you all their stories, experience anything they are still able to do... bring your laptop. There will be plenty of time between those moments to turn your mind to websites and whatever just to distract yourself from the doctor's office, or hospital room, or the nap they are taking. That's all I have. I will pray for you and your family. If you want to talk or need someone just to listen, im available.",

You're responsible for people's livelihoods.\n\nThese aren't really regrets they're more experiences that would have been good to know about before starting.",

Endless liability and requirements. Truly insane being forced to honour “verbal contracts” aka conversations during reviews where nothing was promised other than a review of circumstances and a decision back turning into arbitration situations that wasted tons of time and money despite being provably in the right.

      "selftext": "When I started my company, I was naive.\n\nI thought success and money would come fast.  \nSix months. Maybe a year.\n\nI believed that if the idea was good and I worked hard enough, things would line up.  \nThat investors were out there, waiting for founders like me to show up with the right story.\n\nThat belief didn’t come from nowhere.  \nSocial media makes entrepreneurship look fast, obvious, and rewarding, especially if you are willing to sacrifice a bit.\n\nReality was very different.\n\nEarly on, I met an entrepreneur who had been through a divorce.  \nI asked him about his journey and about the divorce.\n\nHe told me something simple:\n\n“Everything has a price.  \nIf you are not willing to pay it, you don’t get the reward.”\n\nAt the time, I understood the words.  \nI didn’t understand the depth.\n\nWhat I know now is that entrepreneurship doesn’t just test your skills.  \nIt tests how much uncertainty you can live with, and for how long, without breaking.\n\nIt’s lonely.  \nNot in a dramatic way.  \nIn a quiet, repetitive way.\n\nThere are very few celebrations.  \nJust an endless stream of decisions, doubts, and problems to solve.  \nEvery day.\n\nYou lose people along the way.\n\nNot because you become arrogant.  \nNot because you “don’t care anymore.”  \nBut because you stop building an acceptable life, one where responsibility is shared, and move toward a life where outcomes fall largely on you.\n\nYou stop drifting.  \nYou take control.  \nAnd once you do, there’s no one left to blame.\n\nThat mindset doesn’t stay at work.\n\nIt changes how you see relationships.  \nTime.  \nCompromise.  \nRisk.\n\nYou start operating with a level of intensity and accountability that not everyone around you wants or can follow.\n\nIn my case, this contributed to my divorce.  \nI couldn’t stay in a relationship that no longer worked for either of us.  \nThat choice came with real loneliness.\n\nI also used to believe entrepreneurship was about eventually sharing success with your family.  \nMore freedom.  \nMore time.  \nMore presence.\n\nWhat I didn’t anticipate is that the transition itself is costly.\n\nYou lose time before you gain any.  \nYou are less present than you’d like.  \nAnd the emotional margin shrinks long before the rewards show up.\n\nThere is something important I wish I had understood earlier.\n\nEntrepreneurship is not just hard.  \nIt is hard in a very specific way.\n\nIf you struggle with prolonged uncertainty,  \nif you need frequent reassurance,  \nif financial stress or ambiguity quickly destabilize you,  \nthis path can slowly erode you.\n\nNot because you are weak.  \nBut because not everyone is wired to operate for long periods without feedback, validation, or safety nets.\n\nAnd that is okay.\n\nThere is no shame in choosing stability.  \nIn preferring predictable income.  \nIn building a life with more emotional space.\n\nEntrepreneurship isn’t better.  \nIt isn’t braver.  \nIt is simply a different set of trade offs, and a very expensive one psychologically.\n\nI am not sharing this to complain or to glorify suffering.  \nI chose this path, and I still do.\n\nBut if you are considering it, be honest with yourself about the price.  \nAnd if you are already on it and feeling this weight,\n\nyou are not broken.\n\nYou are experiencing what this path actually demands.",

          "body": "This is one hundred percent spot on the truth.\n\nI always remind myself that those giant Redwood trees in California have to suffer through decades of forest fires for their bark to grow thick enough to be able to grow so tall.\n\nWhen I was in my twenties, I wanted to be a business owner for fuck you money. When I was in my early thirties, I almost gave up and chose stability. Find a large growing family and my wife wasn't on the same page with my long-term goals, and who I was as a person. After fifteen years it led to our divorce.\n\nAt absolute rock bottom in December 2016 I went out one New Years eve, broken, and ready for the end. I met my now wife that night just before midnight. We spent three and a half days talking. She told me to kick off bottom.She saw who I was deep down.\n\nIt made all the difference in the world. I thought maybe...\n\n2017 I started my business with literally nothing but my skills, knowledge, and enough spark to kick hard off bottom. I'd built companies over and over again that were very successful for the people that i've worked for over the years. I knew what to do, and I had a new energy to do it. I had nothing to lose and I had everything to lose.\n\nLooking back, I did believe within that first year we would break seven figures easily. We had a commercial truck part that had never been manufactured overseas. We chose higher grade materials, and we modified the designs to make installation a fraction of the time. I set the price at 50%-60% less than anyone else in the market. I made a 150-200 cold calls everyday except some Sundays for many many years consistently.\n\nLike you I slowly realized that it was definitely going to be a much longer journey. Those first four years we ate at food banks more than we ate at grocery stores. Well, at least my wife and I did. We let the kids eat the good stuff and they never knew.\n\nThe divorce dragged on for 6 long years. I changed my goal to wanting. Fuck you money so I could get better lawyers, specialists, and private detectives. I lost 2 daughters in that season and a son whom I was eventually able to find and reconnect with. I gained three amazing stepchildren. Lost a few people to covid. Almost lost the home five different times. Eventually, choosing to sell it, and buying an r v to live in. Cut all holidays and birthdays down to homemade gifts. Downsize everything out of our lives. Ran up hundreds of thousands in lawyer debts. \n\nThe struggles were what motivated me to work through it though. I couldn't sleep. I knew my kids were out there somewhere alive. A human is not built to successfully grieve a child that is missing but still alive.\n\nAfter my wife and kids were in bed, I would get out of bed and work until 2-4am at times. Not because I wanted to, but I couldn't sleep. Those days and weeks and months may have been what pushed us through those first four years. \n\nI wouldn't change any of it. We achieved the freedom of time, more control of our lives, touched countless lives with the resources we have built at the fuck you money stage. \n\nIt's not for everyone now.And that's okay. My biggest lesson that i've learned is you have to find bliss in the day to day.No matter what.",

If you want a slightly “faster” path to success, don’t go straight to building a business, build sales. Find your customer FIRST, with a sign up sheet and product mock ups. With cold calls or emails. With ads. Forget the overhead and LLC and all the irrelevant parts. Go straight to sales. Once you have proven that there are customers on the other side, ready, willing and able to pay for the product. Then, and only then, build a business. You should always be testing new business ideas by first trying to find a customer. And then building upon that. Thats how many greats who started on a shoestring budget, without investors, did it.

          "body": "Thanks for sharing. You bring out a number of points that I certainly experienced as a two time entrepreneur. Maybe one of the most insightful and honest words about what it takes to be a real entrepreneur. What really hits home is:\n\n“Everything has a price.\nIf you are not willing to pay it, you don’t get the reward.”\n\nI started my first company as a spin off of another company that was sold. I had a partner who was the university-based founder of the first company. Plus, other key people from that company were investors in the spin off. I was CEO for 2 years and stepped back into a CTO role and my partner left the university to come on board as CEO. We raised over $70M, got in the pipeline to do an IPO, then 911 hit and the shit really hit fan. We ended up laying off 80% of our staff (many who were good friends).  We refocused on our core and took a few years to stabilize. We got new investors, my cofounder was pushed out, new management came in and the company was sold for 2-3 years later for $50M. I worked my ass off for 10+ years and only got about $300K out of the sale. I left shortly after, looked for job, couldn’t find one and decided to start a new company again.\n\nI moved with my wife and 12 year old son to a state where I didn’t know anyone. A fresh start. I licensed technology out of the local university and started a new company on my own. I did everything myself for a year and got some part time contractors to help (including key tech workers from the university). I got some early sales and had investors knocking on my door. I was trying to avoid taking any investor money, but I was burning thru my personal savings, so I decided to take on some investment. My goal was to raise as little as possible while getting sales. Ultimately ended of raising about $15M over an 8 years period and sold the company for nearly $100M. As the sole founder I did pretty well. \n\nAlong the way, I experienced many of the personal issues you mentioned. My wife left me because I just didn’t have time for her or my son. This still pains me nearly 20 years later. Eventually we reconciled and are doing well today, but the journey was extremely painful on a personal basis, but hugely rewarding from a business perspective.   I’ve been a board member, advisor, investor in a number of other startups and try to warn the founders of the personal pains they will experience, the commitment required, etc. Most just don’t make it, especially if they have something else they can fall back onto. \n\nBest of luck to you.",

Engineering probably has changed the most but here are some use cases that has impressed me personally as the CEO:\n\n1. Writing Code: Like Ryan Dahl said, all of our software engineers have kinda become product managers because almost all actual code is written using AI agents like Windsurfs Cascade! I believe Cursor is pretty good as well but we use Windsurf mostly!\n2. A/B Testing at Scale:  Our team setup an automation flow using N8N that automatically uses Google Nano Banana and Gemini to generate ad variations using our Google ads data! This is then tested and auto improved on based on results! This is literally manual work that used to take ours and freelance designers to modify the assets! We still review the ads but 90% of the time is saved! \n3. Call Summary &amp; Action Items: We have setup otter to record all our customer calls! It auto generates transcript, summary and action items. This is then auto sync'ed to our customer database in notion so now no meeting ever gets lost again. \n4. Blogs &amp; Social Media Content: We have used AI tools like frizerly to automate the process of coming up of a content strategy using our Google search data. This is then used to automatically publish a blog on our website every day using our internal data like customer testimonials, case studies etc. The content is then repurposed into social media posts and posted automatically as well! This has helped us show up more often on Google search results and not look dead on social media tbh! It's quite impressive how AI can create full blown images for instagram posts featuring actual products etc!\n5. Auto Resolving Repetitive Support Tickets: We have been able to resolve repetitive customer support tickets using Intercom fin quite well! Other questions are still manually handled by our support team! \n\nAnd that's all I can think of rn! Following to see what others are using it for :)",

No more manual stalking.\n\n**Community engagement at scale** \\- Honestly didn't expect this, but AI for finding relevant discussions (Reddit, forums, Twitter) where your product actually fits has been huge. Used to spend hours scrolling, now tools like ThreadPal surface the right conversations automatically.\n\n**Customer support triage** \\- AI categorizes tickets by urgency and suggests responses. Your team only touches the complex stuff.\n\nThe pattern: eliminate repetitive tasks so you can focus on the 20% that actually moves revenue.",

          "body": "Yeah, AI is genuinely a really useful tool for business right now. When it’s used correctly, it can bring a lot of value. Here are a few use cases I think are helpful for almost any business:\n\n1. Faster content creation + repurposing (marketing/social media) AI can help generate ideas or turn one concept into multiple formats: posts for different platforms, story/script ideas, and it can also improve or help create captions, descriptions, headlines, and versions for different tones and audiences. This saves time and makes posting consistently easier, without burnout.\n2. Call summaries + follow-up support for sales. After speaking with a potential client, you can use AI to quickly create a short call summary, highlight key points (what the client needs, their questions, concerns), and draft a follow-up message: an email or a short text with clear next steps.\n3. Customer support + FAQ automation A simple chatbot/support assistant that answers common questions and hands off complex cases to a human. Saves time and improves response speed.\n4. Internal knowledge base search So your team can ask things like “what’s our refund policy?” or “how do we price X?” and get answers directly from your docs. Saves time and makes work smoother for everyone.\n5. Basic operational automations Workflows like: form submitted → create a deal in the CRM → assign an owner → send an onboarding email → set a follow-up task. It removes a lot of unnecessary steps and simplifies the workflow.\n6. Data cleanup + research. AI can help with lead categorization, summarizing competitor pages and reviews, and spotting recurring patterns in customer feedback.\n\nOne key point: the best ROI usually comes from embedding AI into an existing workflow, not trying to replace everything at once. Start with one bottleneck (support, sales, admin) and measure the impact.",

Ecco tre casi d'uso 'brutali' che ogni founder dovrebbe implementare:\n\n1. **Il Grill della validazione H24:** Usa l'IA per simulare migliaia di interazioni con il tuo target e trovare i **'Fatal Flaws'** (difetti letali) del tuo modello di business prima ancora di scrivere una riga di codice.\n2. **Eliminazione della 'Lussuria dello spreco':** Esistono tool di IA che analizzano il tuo burn rate e le tue spese operative identificando istantaneamente il 'Lusso dello spreco'. Se l'IA non vede un impatto diretto sul cliente, quel costo va tagliato.\n3. **Customer Impact Mapping istantaneo:** Puoi usare l'IA per analizzare i feedback dei competitor e generare una **Customer Impact Map** che ti dica esattamente dove il mercato sta fallendo, permettendoti di essere rilevante in 7 secondi.\n\nEssere 'AI First' significa usare l'intelligenza artificiale per uscire dal **Labirinto della vaghezza** dieci volte più velocemente degli altri. L'IA costruisce la scala, ma sei tu che devi decidere su quale muro appoggiarla.\n\nOttimo spunto per il 2026!",

      "selftext": "I've watched dozens of founders announce their fundraise over the past year. Most of them follow the same playbook: write a LinkedIn post, maybe a Twitter thread, attach some founder headshots, thank their investors, and call it a day.\n\nThey get 50 likes. Their investors comment. A few friends reshare. And then it's gone.\n\nMeanwhile, a handful of founders treat their fundraise like a marketing moment and the difference in outcomes is wild.\n\nWhy does this even matter?\n\nHere's what most founders don't realize: a fundraising announcement isn't just \"news.\" It's one of the only moments where you have a legitimate reason to be loud. You have something to say. People expect you to share it. And if you do it right, you're not just announcing money. You're doing three things at once:\n\n1. Building credibility. When your announcement gets traction, future investors see momentum. It makes the next round easier. The halo effect is real.\n2. Driving signups. A viral fundraising moment doesn't just impress VCs. It brings in users who were on the fence. People want to be part of something that's clearly working.\n3. Creating leverage. When everyone's talking about you, recruiting gets easier. Partnerships open up. Press reaches out. You're suddenly on people's radar.\n\nBest example I've seen: Arlan Rakhmetzhanov dropped a cinematic video recreating that famous scene from The Social Network. It hit 2-3 million views across LinkedIn and X. Investors reached out. Other founders started talking about him.\n\nThe money matters. But the attention you get for free might matter more.",

Since your physical presence is not required its easier to delegate or automate without risking the business.\n2. Scaling - Scaling in tech is generally easier. You don’t need to have a lot of capital investments to scale up.\n3. Opportunity - There are countless problems where software can add value.

Dude was a backend engineer for like 8 years and started flipping furniture on weekends because he wanted to work with his hands. Started with facebook marketplace finds, now he's got this whole setup in his garage and makes decent side money. What's funny is he says the problem-solving skills from debugging translate really well to figuring out what's wrong with a piece and how to fix it.\n\nThe thing that seems to work for the folks I know who've done this is picking something where your tech brain gives you an edge even if it's not \"tech.\" Like another friend does wedding photography but she built her own booking system and client management stuff that saves her hours compared to other photographers. She's not selling software but she's still using those skills.\n\ntbh the biggest shift seems to be going from \"how do I build this feature\" to \"how do I find customers who will pay me money.\" That's the part that trips up a lot of engineers because suddenly you're doing sales and marketing and bookkeeping instead of just solving the technical problem. But having a steady paycheck while you figure that stuff out is honestly the smart move, especially with kids.\n\nStart small and see what actually energizes you - even just spending a few hours on weekends trying something different might help you figure out what direction feels right.",

I want to be optimistic because I’ve bet my career on this, but we need to be honest about what’s actually happening on the ground.\nIf you believe the headlines, we are a superpower now. Electronics production hit $135B (₹11.3 lakh crore) last year, and we are the 2nd largest mobile manufacturer in the world. On paper, it looks like a revolution.\nBut in my studio, the reality feels different.\nThe issue is that while the \"Production\" numbers are up 6x, the local value add is stuck at like 15-20%. That means for every \"Made in India\" phone, ~85% of the value is still just imported parts that we screw together here.\nI dug into the trade data to see if I was just imagining it, and it’s actually getting worse in some areas:\nOur imports from China almost doubled between 2017 and 2024 (hit ~$129B).\nWe still rely on them for 94% of our Li-ion batteries and 88% of ICs.\nThe bottleneck isn't talent.\nThe issue I face daily is speed vs. compliance. If I’m in Shenzhen, I can get a complex PCB prototyped and assembled in 3 days. Here, I spend that same time just waiting for a specific sensor to clear customs or dealing with BIS certification paperwork.\nI’m trying to solve this for my clients by handling the end-to-end mess for them, but it’s an uphill battle.\nI’m curious to hear from other hardware founders here: What is the actual blocker for you?\nIs it that you literally can't source the components locally, or is it that the BIS/Customs headache just makes it not worth the effort compared to importing white-label stuff?",

Back in March I landed a restaurant owner who needed a simple website menu, hours, contact form, maybe 10 pages total. $2,500, signed contract, everything by the book. First month goes great. He's responsive, sends assets on time, compliments the work. I'm thinking this is the dream client. Then the site launches and the \"quick questions\" start. \"Can you just add a reservations button?\" Sure, 30 minutes, I'll throw it in. \"Can you make the menu downloadable as a PDF?\" Fine, easy. \"Can you add a little animation to the header?\" Okay, getting annoying but whatever. By month two I've done maybe 15 of these \"quick\" things. I finally sit down and add it up 12 hours of extra work. At my rate that's $600 I just gave away for free. So I send him a nice email explaining that future changes will be billed hourly, gave him my rate, even offered a discount because we had a good relationship. He loses it. Says I'm \"nickel and diming\" him. Says a \"real professional\" would stand behind their work. Says he thought we were \"building something together.\" I tried to explain the original scope was delivered months ago but he just kept saying \"it's the same website though.\"\n\nYesterday he left me a 1-star Google review saying I \"surprised him with hidden fees after the project was done.\" The thing that kills me is I don't even think he's being malicious. He genuinely doesn't understand that what he asked for was extra. In his head, he hired me to \"do his website\" and the website isn't done until he says it's done. I should have had this conversation after the second or third request. Instead I stayed quiet trying to be the \"chill\" freelancer and now I'm the bad guy. How do you even explain scope to a client who doesn't think in those terms? Or do you just avoid these clients entirely?",

          "body": "My solution to this problem with clients works every time.\n\nStep 1: have client send links to sites similar to what they want their site to look like and similar to the contents they envision. Tell them to group the links by (a) sites with color schemes they like, (b) with layouts they like, and (c) content and content organization they like.\n\nStep 2: set up a 15 minute zoom call to go through the sites they provide so you have an idea for layout, color and mending. Keep it to 15 minutes, you are training the client to be concise.\n\nStep 3: create 3 mock-ups. I call them mentally bare-bones, expected choice, and kitchen sink. But I describe them to the client as entry level business profile, typical feature informational website, and custom professional website. Price differential should be very wide, like $800, $2,200 and $25,000.\n\nStep 3: give them a process timeline and a build analogy. I use a home building metaphor which goes \"We first draw the blueprint, and you can make any change at that point such as different layout, menus, number of pages or sections, features, etc. Then we lay the foundation which is where we register the URL, build the menus (plumbing), lay out each page (rooms). Then we complete the look and feel with text and images (finish carpentry and flooring.)\" You do this to be able to say \"remember, i told you there is no charge to change the site layout during 'blueprint' phase, but we are now at the finish stage and the change you are asking for takes us back two stages, so it will be expensive to do this as we have to tear up the pipes and cement. I will give you a price quote for that change.\"\n\nThis works for me. When they jump to \"hey, we really need to add a blah-blah-widget\" you can say \"Great! That was one of the features I suggested in my proposal for a professional level site! Should I go ahead and give you a quote for that addition?\"",

You should have already, after 4 years, addresses the cut off time for included updates, and the cost for additional updates and the cost. Be clear about maintenance going forward. Ask if they want a pre-paid retainer or to do it by the item.\n2. You basically punished them for making updates and failed to provide CLEAR information about future updates. It can feel like getting nickel and dimed.\n3. You offered to do the work free - you started the problem.\n4. In consultations, I say something like: \"The website is done. You pay the final invoice. A month goes by and you want to update the site. Depending on what you need, the maintenance cost is this, this, or this. You can do it hourly, or purchase a discounted update pack for a group of changes, or a retainer for regular updates.\"\n5. If a client doesn't understand what's extra, that's a failing on your part. It needs to be in writing and it needs to be initialed and it needs to be communicated several times, and you need to get an answer on how they plant to manage the site going forward.\n6. You can offer a monthly update for XYZ dollars and it might include (5) updates and you list those updates. Major functionality like a reservation system with a mobile app, or getting DoorDash functionality, etc. All the updates requested above, I'd do in a monthly maintenance session for $55 - about 20 minutes of work usually. Adding a menu PDF is problematic, the menu changes, add a solution where they can make updates to the menu and a \"Print PDF\" is automatic.\n7. There are tasks as Webmaster that are included in their annual hosting/domain renewal - things like new email addresses, backups, restore, etc.\n8. I took a lot of lumps when I started my brand and web development company. Each issue with a client taught me how to be smarter with the next.\n9. I made a lot of areas self-manageable and offered to train them or an employee. I also included a user guide with easy steps to update a page or add a page.\n10. All these things they are asking for should have been offered anyway. Go ahead and add these items to your offerings for restaurants.\n11. I also make them complete an online form in their account, for requesting updates. They check boxes for what they want done, and it indicates \"included in current maintenance plan\" or \"additional fees\". If they go over a certain amount, it adds fees. One client dumped me because he wanted to text me at all hours and I told him I don't do business by text. Log in to his account and submit requests - there needs to be a record. He came back after a while.\n12. It sounds cliche, but an educated customer is your best customer - you have to educate them.\n\n**Good luck next time. As for the 1 star, if you're able to respond:**\n\n&gt;\" Nicks Cafe is a valued client and we are proud of the work we were able to do in launching their new web site. The contracted and paid web design phase was for 6 weeks. Once the site launched, any updates are billed either hourly or through a maintenance plan. Any errors or loss of functionality, we correct at no charge, but new pages, new features, or changes or deletions, are billed items. We apologize that the maintenance costs were not understood. We welcome the opportunity to make it right by offering a discounted 1 year maintenance plan. We have reached out to Nick with this offer.\"\n\nFigure out what deep discount you can offer to save your reputation and reach out to the client. For me, it's worth it to even give him a set amount of updates per month for a year at $100. The business you lose is infinite. Be sure to come up with a pricing plan for 2027 that keeps him happy after you see what he requested in updates this year. I also use clients like this to try out new features I install free. Then when it's tested, I can actively market it and point to them as a LIVE example.\n\nA lot of people are telling you to snark, but it's partly your fault for not being clear. If you value customers who put food on the table, be kind, but be firm and professional. My business was 99% word of mouth. Not one client in my portfolio would say a bad word about me. Do whatever it takes to make it right - within reason - and fine tune your contracts and communication about price.\n\nIn freelancing, when there's a problem, take a look a how you failed.

Anything outside of scope, send a change order / contract amendment, and get it signed before you do any of that work.\n\nDo this EVEN IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO THE ADDITIONAL WORK FOR FREE.

The ideal solution would be not to bill on hours -- for **this** contract/website. *In his mind*, he didn't agree to an hourly rate, or sign off on menu items, so they feel like tack-ons, and he has no out but to settle on a subpar website. In his mind, it feels like being taken hostage -- he can keep paying more and more at a rate he didn't necessarily agree to pay, to reach a complete website; or he can accept a subpar website. Neither solution is really palatable to him, so maybe he felt no other escape but an angry review.\n\nSolution: In the next contract, either break down 'website' further into individual items (button == X, subpage == Y, copy edit == Z, ...) or just spell out the hourly rate for add-ons.\n\nFrom your standpoint, what you can do to recover those lost/unbilled hours is to charge a higher hourly rate on this next contract. So over time, you break even again and even go higher. But don't damage the client relationship by nickel-and-diming. You have a right to your time, but acknowledge his feelings, turn him positive by saying you'll do it for free **for this website** \\-- and then just spell out hourly rates or a menu of items in the next contract. You'll make a fan out of him and come out ahead, plus he won't leave that review.\n\nAt this stage, maybe you can ask for him to remove the 1-star review in that next contract.\n\nThis is how I've done it. I've been on both sides. His feelings are sound. So are yours. Just take the loss on this one contract, then apply your adjusted expectations to the next one -- or walk away. Think long-term. You want happy clients. Guys who are noisy 1-star reviews are also noisy in 5-star praise. So turn him into the 5-star guy by swallowing your ego, acknowledging his feelings, and then playing for the next contract, with much more specific breakdowns and a favorable hourly rate.

So every new idea still feels like “the same website” to them.\n\nWhere things usually go wrong (and you already spotted this) is silence. Each “quick favor” silently resets their expectation of what’s included. By the time you bring up billing, it feels sudden to them — even if it’s completely reasonable.\n\nWhat’s worked better for me over time:\n\n* Define the scope in **plain outcomes**, not technical tasks launch-ready site with X pages; post-launch changes billed.\n* Introduce the concept of paid changes **early**, even if you waive the first 1–2 small ones. That sets the mental model.\n* Frame it as a **process**, not a fee: “After launch, all changes go through a small change request so nothing breaks.”\n\nAs for avoiding these clients — you usually can’t. Restaurants, small businesses, first-time website owners often think this way. The real filter isn’t the client; it’s whether you enforce boundaries *before* resentment builds.\n\nThe Google review hurts, but honestly, most experienced freelancers reading your story will recognize it immediately because we’ve all learned this lesson the same way.",

Last year I landed this marketing agency that became my anchor client steady projects, $1,000-1,200 a month, super professional, paid within 48 hours every time. I'm thinking this is what sustainable freelancing looks like. Around November they tell me their business partner is launching a new venture and needs a developer. \"You'd be perfect for this, they're great to work with, we've been in business together for 6 years.\" I take the referral because of course I do. Good client vouching for someone, easy decision. First call with the referral and I can already tell something's off. Vague about requirements, keeps saying \"we'll figure it out as we go,\" but I push through because I trust my original client's judgment. Project starts and it's a nightmare. Constantly changing scope, wants daily updates, questions every decision, rude on calls. \"Why is this taking so long?\" \"I found a template that does this in 10 minutes.\" \"My nephew said he could build this.\" I'm bending over backwards trying to make it work detailed documentation, extra calls, revisions I'm not charging for. Two months in I finally realize this isn't going to get better. I send a professional email saying I don't think we're the right fit, offered to transition everything to another developer, even gave them a partial refund for the hassle. They lose it. Email my original client saying I \"abandoned their project\" and \"wasted their time.\" Suddenly my anchor client is cold. \"You made me look bad in front of my partner.\" \"I vouched for you.\" Haven't gotten a new project from them since. It's been two months.\n\nThat referral didn't just cost me one bad client, it killed a $10K/year relationship I spent a year building. The thing that kills me is I don't even know what I was supposed to do differently. Keep working with someone who made every day miserable? Or stand my ground and lose my best client anyway? How do you handle nightmare referrals from good clients without torching the relationship? Or do you just never take referrals?",

If you need time to decide what you want or what you need that's fine, and if you change your mind while we work we can stop and I'll quote out the changes and upon your approval of the new quote I'll continue. However if you're unwilling to define exactly what you want I can't then appropriately quote and charge you for the work.\"\n\nThen demanding to set his expectations before you guys started and if he couldn't have that then cut it off before it started. \n\nThings like \"now we have the exact scope of the project you want, it's gonna cost 5000 and take 12 weeks.\" I personally always pad the time I actually think it's gonna take, for mechanic work I like to give myself an extra hour so I look good when I finish under that or when I encounter problems unplanned for it's not quite so bad when I tell the customer I need more time cause this bolt was rusted and this one broke off etc.\n\nFinally with the daily updates I would have told him \"Sir you're not my only customer, I'll have your work done in the time frame I gave and I can provide a once a week update as I have other customers and some days I might be working on their projects and some days I'll be working on yours so daily updates won't be productive and just cost me time I could be using to work on your project to tell you \"I coded some letters\". Or \"I am working on someone's else's project today\".\n\nThe other junk he said about the templates and his nephew said something my reply to those comments are \"Ok then why did you choose to hire me instead of doing that?\"\n\nThe psychology of that is using the why questions to make the customer justify in his head why he was right to hire you and it has them define to you what pain points and problem he thinks you're solving for him. Then you take those and use them to point out and rejustify your value to him. \n\nWhile there are plenty of Karen and obnoxious ass hats I find you can either put them in line with strict procedures and rules while setting expectations clearly ahead of time or they will say \"Well I don't like that\" and you simply reply with \"Well I'm not the only web designer on the planet, if you want someone else to do this project who will give you daily updates you can find someone else who will as I am probably just not the right fit.\".

Use that data to create an FAQ or addendum to contract or discovery call checklist or whatever. It's your business. You're in charge. Yes, you need clients and income but you get to decide who your best client is, know why that works when it works, and require courteous and professional engagement within boundaries you set. \n\nGood luck!",

          "body": "You’re not imagining it. This is very common on LinkedIn right now. High likes and comments don’t mean buying intent. Most engagement is performative, people commenting to stay visible in their own network rather than because they’re interested in clicking, DMing, or purchasing. A lot of what looks authentic is driven by automation, engagement pods, or templated replies. Not always bots, but close enough that it feels real and still converts to nothing.\nShared posts are especially weak for results. LinkedIn aggressively suppresses outbound links, and reshares almost never drive referral traffic. Seeing zero visitors even with thousands of likes isn’t unusual. On top of that, commenters are rarely leads. Real buyers usually lurk, save the post, or Google you later. They don’t ask public questions or say they’re “interested” in the comments.\nWhat actually works on LinkedIn is slower and less exciting. Posting consistently from your own founder profile, speaking directly to problem-aware buyers, and treating LinkedIn as a conversation and positioning channel rather than a traffic source. At YellowInk, we only see results when businesses stop chasing vanity metrics and focus on message and positioning over 30–60 days.\n\n\nTL;DR: LinkedIn isn’t broken, but paid shoutouts mostly are. Your spend didn’t buy leads, but it did buy clarity.",

He specifically wanted this textured raised ink effect which required puff printing and that added to the cost but he said no problem. I ordered all the blank hoodies, did the setup work, printed everything, shipped it all out in early December. He confirmed delivery and even sent me a photo saying they looked great.   \nThen last week I got notified by my payment processor that he filed a dispute claiming the quality wasn’t as described and he wants a full refund including the deposit. I reached out immediately with all our email correspondence, the approved design files, his confirmation photo, everything. The payment processor said they’re still reviewing but it could go either way.   \nI’m out almost $4000 in materials and labor if this goes through.

          "body": "Brutal situation, and it happens more than people think with custom work. The hard part is not just “winning the dispute,” it’s that one chargeback can create a cash crunch because you already paid for blanks, labor, shipping, and you cannot resell the product. That’s why for big custom orders you want a simple system that treats chargebacks like a predictable risk: clear written approvals, “custom goods are final” terms, signature delivery, and milestone payments before shipment so you are never carrying the full cost.\n\nThis is also exactly why weekly cash planning matters. If one dispute can put you underwater, it means there is no buffer for shocks. A weekly view of minimum cash you refuse to dip under, big payments coming up, and what is safe to spend this week keeps one bad customer from becoming a business-threatening week. If you share the dispute reason and whether you have signature delivery, I can tell you what evidence usually matters most in the response.",

They're usually much cheaper.\n\nOne thing to consider for business tool discovery: when businesses search for payment solutions or financial tools, they're increasingly using AI assistants instead of Google. A payment service that ranks well on Google might be invisible when someone asks ChatGPT for low-fee wire transfer options. We track this visibility gap through CoreMention (https://coremention.com) - it shows how different sources perform across traditional search vs AI search.\n\nFor finding business tools, understanding both channels matters.

          "body": "Wise has been the most reliable for us with contractors in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus. The key is making sure your contractor sets up a proper Wise account on their end - they can receive in USD and hold it there or convert to local currency when rates are favorable.\n\nFew things that help avoid AML flags on the receiving end:\n\n1. Consistent, documented payments on a regular schedule (invoices help)\n2. Amounts that match what you'd expect for contractor work, not round numbers that look like crypto cashouts\n3. Having them receive directly into Wise rather than converting through local banks\n\nPayoneer works too but I've found their fees slightly higher for smaller amounts. SWIFT is fine but slow and expensive ($25-40 per transfer depending on banks).\n\nFor Georgia specifically, TBC Bank and Bank of Georgia both have decent USD account options if your contractor wants a local bank account that's crypto-separate. The issue your dev had was likely the P2P exchange triggering the flag, not the payment source itself.\n\nEOR is overkill for a single contractor unless you're planning to hire more in Georgia or need the legal protection of having them as an employee.",

FYI, thats not how an auction should work.. I was the highest bidder, and there was no reserve. I have done some business with them before and would plan on doing it in the future so I prefer to be problem adverse, so I just said ok, you can wire me back my money. He says he will try to convince the seller to release it for that amount. About 3 weeks pass with me calling weekly until just over a week ago he says \"Sorry, I'm going to tell my boss to send you back your money\" (His boss is his dad). It's been a week and some change now and nothing. I tried calling him and his dad every day this week, left voicemails, no response, no callback. This is all very unprofessional and frustrating, at what point do I take them to small claims court or something else to get my money back? Any other suggestions?",

Open ended questions: instead of telling them what you think is wrong ask them \"Well what would happen if none of the stuff I left you got done?\"\n\nThese tend to help you get across a point without you telling them and they usually will realize your point on their own. Or you realize they don't understand the purpose behind the work and you can clarify it. \n\n2. Mirroring: basically you repeat the last couple words they said or in the sentence they said in a question. \n\nExample: \nX: well lashaun never had me do any of that, just deal with customers. \n\nYou: Never had you do that?\n\nX: yeah she said it was all manager stuff anyways. \n\nThis will always get people to expand on something or explain. \n\nYou can also purposely say something a little incorrect back to them and they will instinctively want to correct you and give you more information. \n\nExample:\n\nX: well lashaun never had me do any of that, just deal with customers. \n\nYou: Had you do everything?\n\nX: No no no, she told me that was all manager stuff so she never had me do that stuff. \n\n3. Commit with a no, people feel safe saying no, so instead of trying to get them to say yes to something, rephrase your question to a no. \n\nExample:\n\nWould I be crazy to ask you to just finish the list I give you for work? \n\nAm I being an asshole to tell you to take out the trash? \n\nEtc.\n\n4. \"Seems like\", similar to mirroring but you make an assumption, start it with seems like, looks like, feels like, sounds like, etc and state your assumption of what you think is happening and let them comment on it or correct you. \n\nExample:\n\nYou: It seems like Lashaun never properly trained you. \n\nX: Yeah she never did any training with me .......\n\nOr\n\nYou: Seems like you feel underpaid and treated like shit. \n\nX: I mean I could always use more pay but you have actually been pretty fine as a boss.\n\n5. Put them together, you can use those techniques together to basically pull lots of information from this employee, understand them and their viewpoint completely, and then from this understanding help them shift it by aligning what you want them to do with their thoughts, feelings, goals, etc.\n\nEdit: forgot one, similar to the seems like, but basically you call out what you think they might feel when you say something. \n\nDon't say \"I'm not trying to be an asshole\" instead call it out \"I'm probably gonna be an asshole for saying this\" then say what you want to say. People tend to handle it much better when you call it out ahead of time.",

Whether that is in the form of official employee handbook policies, a written job description, or a list of tasks that need to be completed during their shift. Likely all of the above. Said SOP should be reviewed with each employee and have them sign off on it, which goes in their file.

          "body": "There were several reasons to pull your email from other services into Gmail using POP3 retrieval. For some of them there are workarounds, for others not.\n\n1. You want to read all your email from two or more servers in one email client, i.e., Gmail.\n\n2. You want to back up all your email received on other servers in an online archive without paying for the storage, preferably one with lots of capacity, good search tools, good security, and easily accessible from anywhere, i.e. Gmail. (Presumably you also keep a local copy if you are smart.)\n\n3. You want to take advantage of Gmail's spam filtering and flexible auto filters applied to incoming email.\n\nThe solution that satisfies all 3 and is pretty much equivalent to what is being lost is to simply turn the direction of communications around and have your other email servers forward all email to Gmail instead of having Gmail retrieve the email by POP3 polling. This satisfies all 3 of the functions and it's faster (forwarding happens in seconds, whereas Gmail polls at irregular intervals which can stretch to hours). Problems: your other email services may not have a \"forward all\" function, or they may add a header which makes it look like the forwarded mail is coming from you rather than the original sender. And then there's the spam issue: there's a danger that dumb spam-blockers may decide that you are the originator of any spam among the emails that you are forwarding to Gmail, and therefore your email address should be blacklisted as a spammer (and yes, this does happen - I've encountered it, had to give up forwarding).\n\nOther partial solutions:\n\nThe Gmail app (not the web interface) allows you to view email from your other services together with your Gmail in the common Gmail interface. You just add your other services to the app as additional email sources. But this is view-only. This satisfies function#1. It does not retrieve that email and add it to your Gmail account, so no good for functions #2 and #3.\n\nYou can use an IMAP-enabled email client like Thunderbird, both on the desktop and as an app. Thunderbird lets you add Gmail (via IMAP) and your other IMAP/POP servers in one interface. And it lets you copy email to and from IMAP clients like Gmail. So it satisfies functions #1 and #2, although you have to do the copying manually. Sadly Gmail does not apply incoming email rules or spam filtering to email copied in via IMAP., so function #3 is out.",

It started free BUT they don't include shipped samples before you place an order. So for any of your merch, you'll have to pay full price each time you want to check a sample. I didn't like that.

          "body": "I went with a card printer that specialized in literal cards for games, not a general printer that could cut the size I wanted. If your audience has a quality of card in mind, you're going to want to hit that or risk losing them right away, and if you're incorporating special printing effects or foiling, you're going to want to make sure the printer can handle that as well, since not every printer can. With any kind of physical printing, you're going to want to acquire a ton of sample packs from each printer you're interested in, and maybe even tour the facility if it's a local operation (if you're primarily producing cards). Being able to speak intelligently about the product you offer, from type of printing to cardstock and ink, is a big plus. And if you don't know much about printing, you're going to want to learn. Either pay more for them to send you physical proofs or pay someone to teach you basic print prod. Proofs/ revisions/ reprint stuff falls on your back... if you approve something that goes to press with some amount of allowed variance, you may or may not be happy with the final result, so your design will have to be flexible enough to accommodate, and general stuff like that. I produced a large amount of cards for a single project, so not over time and not in batches, but also keep in mind it's always cheaper to print once than to print in batches, if you're watching your math.\n\nFor actual printers, I've used Printful a few times for various products and their quality widely varies. So yeah, you're going to want to test some options for sure. The eventual place I used for card printing, and for which I was very happy with the result, was https://premiumcards.net/ink/.",

      "selftext": "Hey Reddit,\n\nThis isn’t a post I ever thought I’d write, but here we are.\n\nA while ago, I lost my job. Not because I was bad at it, not because I didn’t care, and not because I didn’t try. I genuinely gave it my best. I grew, took responsibility, learned fast, and showed up every day trying to do meaningful work.\n\nAnd then it ended. \n\nWhat followed was months of job searching, applications, interviews, silence, rejections, and a slow erosion of confidence. If you’ve been there, you know the feeling: days start blending together, motivation becomes fragile, and at some point you quietly start wondering if maybe you’re just… not that good after all.\nThat part hit me harder than I expected.\nSo instead of staying stuck in that loop, I’ve decided to try something different — and honestly, pretty terrifying.\n\nI’m going to try to build a small company of my own. 💀\n\nI don’t have a safety net. I don’t have funding. I don’t have some romantic “always wanted to be an entrepreneur” backstory. What I do have is a background in digital content, UX, learning design, and product thinking — basically, turning messy ideas into clear, usable things that actually help people. I’ve spent years doing that for organizations. Now I’m going to try doing it for myself.\n\nWith little to no real business experience.\nThis subreddit (and Reddit in general) feels like the right place to do this, because it’s basically the collective brain of the internet — smart, skeptical, supportive when it counts, and very good at calling bullshit. I don’t want to pretend I have it all figured out. I don’t. That’s kind of the point.\n\nMy plan is to share:\nwhat I’m trying to build\nthe decisions I make (good and bad)\nwhat I learn along the way\nthe mistakes, doubts, small wins, and inevitable faceplants\n\nNot as a “guru journey,” but as a real, ongoing process of trying to take responsibility for my own life after it didn’t go the way I planned.\nIf nothing else, I want this to be honest. And if it does work — even a little — I want to be able to say I didn’t give up on myself when it would’ve been easier to do so.\n\nIf you’ve been through layoffs, career detours, or that quiet feeling of “I know I can do good things, why doesn’t life seem to agree?”, you’re not alone. And if you’re curious to follow along, offer advice, criticism, or just lurk… I’d genuinely appreciate having you here.\nI’ll post my first concrete step soon.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nYours truly, \n\nD",

Income, OpX and Travel.\n\nIncome - where all your receivables go\nOpX - where all your operational expenses are paid from\nTravel - the only business card that stays in your wallet and is used when you are running delivering your product or service \n\nThe Income account is your oxygen supply, when it gets low or zero you are in critical condition.\n\nOnce a month transfer your monthly nut plus 10% for operational expenses.  You can get away with missing 1 or 2 payments on operations, not much beyond that.  Make sure there are no overdraft fees or nsf fees with this account.  When it's empty, it's empty.\n\nWhen you have enough for Ops and running payroll for yourself, transfer from Income to OpX and immediately pay yourself.\n\nDo not use MCA loans, those guys are fucking loan sharks and the payments are due weekly; the full interest is applied right at the start of the loan.  \n\nSBA loans are about the only thing I would recommend for large strategic purchases.

The best-selling car in the US is the Ford F150, with an average sold price of about $66,000. \n\nIf everybody is so broke, why isn't the most popular car an economy car? Why are none of the top 10 most-popular cars economy cars? \n\nI think the issue (and I'm making a point in a second) is that the average person is not buying new cars. They're holding onto the car they had, not replacing cars once they break permanently, and buying used. Who's buying cars has skewed. \n\nI think the same thing is happening with business launches. My business-plan clients are coming to me better-prepared, both in education and financing, than they did 10 years ago. So i think what we're seeing is better-funded startups able to afford those rents. The people who can't are still at their day job(s). \n\nThe arguments that businesses signed a lease x number of years ago falls flat with me. Most commercial leases are 3 years, especially for new businesses. Even big franchisees usually sign for 5 years with a renew option. People aren't paying rent on 15-year old leases. And even if their lease was low, their NNN has probably exploded lately. \n\nFew people own a commercial property that they can use AND live in the building. Most of those are professionals with an office on the ground floor and living space upstairs. They're not what you think of when you're talking about a store or gym or convenience store. Maybe a couple of hundred thousand people across all categories of own/work/live in the US. It certainly does nothing to explain businesses justifying high rent.",

While these methods can work, they often require a lot of manual effort. That’s where [WebIeadr](https://webleadr.pages.dev) comes in. A platform where web designers, developers, SEO specialists, and similar professionals can easily find and contact web design leads such as businesses without websites, in just a couple of clicks, along with many other features (check the website to explore all of them)!\n\nWebIeadr offers a one-time, credit-based system: **$12 for 100 business leads**. No subscriptions or recurring fees: pay only when needed. Credits stay in your account and can be used anytime, with options to buy more as needed. For example, if 40 out of 100 leads lack websites and 15 use third-party services (e.g., Facebook), and you secure just a mere 3 clients with basic sales skills, you could earn around $2,000. Your cost? Just $12\n\nThe bottom line is that WebIeadr offers an extremely quick and efficient solution to find web design leads in just a few clicks and **call them in just one click of a button**. From there, all you need to do is apply your sales skills to convince them that having a website is a worthwhile investment for their business.\n\nKnow a web designer, developer, or SEO specialist who could benefit from this? Please share this post with them. They’ll thank you later!",

When a client asks how to do something in app or website, just record your screen while completing the task (can be without audio as well), upload the video to video2docs, and it automatically generates a written guide with all necessary screenshots from it, which you can refine if needed in app before the final export. 📑\n\nWe built it based on our own needs. It is free to try, so i would be happy to hear any feedback, what was good and what you lack from this solution! Link: https://video2docs.com",

Whether you're a tradesperson, consultant, freelancer, or growing business, the right number can make you instantly recognisable and easier to reach.\n\n\nWhy it matters:\n- Brand recall: A clean, memorable number sticks in your customer’s mind long after the conversation ends.  \n- Professional image: It signals that you take your business seriously and pay attention to the details.  \n- Customer trust: People are more likely to call a number that feels simple, clear, and intentional.  \n- Marketing impact: Whether on vans, business cards, websites, or ads, a standout number boosts response rates.\n\n\nAt SimpleSimUK.com, we've built a small startup focused on helping UK professionals secure premium, easy‑to‑remember mobile numbers without the usual hassle or inflated prices.

Wearables like shirts also ran into sizing issues. \n\nNotebooks and pens were popular for educational conferences or places where note taking happens.

If the later, why aren’t the cases thrown out immediately?\n\n————————————————————-\n\nARE WEBSITES LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO COMPLY WITH WCAG GUIDELINES BASED ON SECTION 508?\n\nYes. Some US-based websites must comply with Section 508’s accessibility guidelines, essentially the WCAG 2.0 Mark II standards.\n\nIf your website is:\n\n-US federal-funded website\n\n-A business that gives paid services to a federal-funded website or entity",

We hired an attorney who was also representing multiple companies being sued by the same plaintiff for the same thing. It made the settlement negotiations a lot easier and reduced the attorneys fees as they were able to negotiate a global settlement for all parties at once. Ultimately it is a shake down, expect it to cost you $10k all in. Also make sure to add something like Accessibe to your site to deter them in the future",

Some lawyers use that info to argue for procedural defenses, push for dismissal, or negotiate more favorable settlements. But it doesn’t automatically mean you’ll win; compliance still matters, and courts can rule against serial plaintiffs if your site actually violates ADA. Definitely share your research with your lawyer—they’ll know how to use it.",
