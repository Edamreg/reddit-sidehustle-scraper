      "selftext": "idk if this is just me but why do clients suddenly develop amnesia the moment money is involved 😭  \nhad this guy hit me up all confident like “yeah bro let’s do it, timeline is tight but budget is ready” (red flag #1 I ignored bc rent)  \nI do the work, send previews, he’s hyped. like FULL CAPS hyped. “THIS IS PERFECT 🔥🔥”  \ncool. I send invoice.  \nabsolute silence. man vanished like I summoned him with a spell that expired.\n\nI follow up after 2 days. nothing. a week later he replies “sorry bro got busy, will sort tomorrow”  \ntomorrow has now been 11 tomorrows. I see him posting stories. I see him active on LinkedIn. I see him commenting on other people’s posts like life is amazing. but my invoice? dead. cold. probably in witness protection.\n\nthe worst part is you start questioning yourself like did I mess up? was it not that good? should I have said something different? but nah… this happens WAY too often to be a coincidence. some people just like the idea of hiring freelancers, not actually paying them.\n\nanyway lesson learned (again): hype doesn’t pay bills, screenshots of “looks great” mean nothing, and if someone says “I’ll pay tomorrow” without a date… just mentally move on and don’t pause your life waiting. back to work I guess 🥲\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nPeaceeee!!!!!!!",

I've been a freelancer and made many mistakes too, so not judgment, but yea, this is on you to some extent.\n\nIt sounds like you're not doing proper business practices with briefs, meetings, contracts, upfront payments, watermarks, clear terms, scope &amp; payment conditions etc.\n\nStart taking yourself more professionally, and you'll filter time wasters out immediately. Check out Dann Petty's courses on these topics and level up, and you'll find good clients to work with.\n\nWishing you all the best!",

It’s difficult but if difficulty doesn’t matter, money is there to be made here.\n\n2. Even if you don’t want a career in sales, it’s helpful in your career. Interviews is sales opportunity. Annual performance and salary reviews is sales opportunity.\n\n3. If you ever wanted to build something for yourself, sales is the first skill you will need. Want to start a marketing agency?

          "body": "Okay I know this is going to sound so redundant but being established on survey apps and having a good freelance skill is still the best way to go about it. So I'll give you an example of what I do to make at least $300-500 a month, it's really random and not consistent but works for me.\n\nI use a bunch of survey and play to earn apps during downtime like commute or before bed. That gets me around $80-120 most months. I mainly use Swagbucks and Babki which has both surveys and games so I can switch when one gets boring. Also throw in some other random ones when I see signup bonuses.\n\nThen I do small freelance gigs on Fiverr for excel work mostly data entry or reorgnaization. Some months I get 2-3 gigs and make $200, other months nothing. It's inconsistent but when combined with the apps it usually lands somewhere in that $300-500 range.",

The most i made was 200$ for 4 hours of work, but i removed multiple 8 foot tall bushes, loaded them in my truck and did dump runs. (+ clean their yard up after)\n\nOh, I also have a truck (required lol)\n\nAll this took was creating a name, a quick description of the work I am capable of completing, and some trusting members of my community.\n\nNow, I need a business license and insurance. Ive opted for just telling people I am not a registered business and I dont have insurance, and most people are happy just to have someone there to help.\n\nSo there it is. The side hustle that I could live off of. Yard care to help my community.\n\nHonestly i love it and wish I could do it full time.\n\n",

      "selftext": "Im trying to get verified as a seller on a couple major platforms like amazon and tiktok shop and they are asking for documentation I wasnt expecting. They want a lease agreement in my business name and utility bill showing the business address. Problem is I run everything from home right now and all my utilities are obviously in my personal name not my LLC. My accountant said mixing personal and business addresses can be a headache for taxes too. I reached out to amazon seller support and they basically said without proper business documentation the verification could get rejected. Same thing with tiktok shop, their KYC process is apparently pretty strict about having legit commercial presence. I'm doing about $15k/month right now but want to expand to these bigger platforms. Don't really have the budget or need for actual office space, just need the documentation to pass their verification process.I really dont wanna get my account suspended later because of this since this is my side hustle i let it go to this point.",

You can learn the basics in a few weeks and start freelancing. Ive been doing email marketing for 11 years and its still one of the most in demand skills out there. All you need is a laptop\r\n\r\nFreelance writing – if you can write decent theres always work. Blogs, articles, website copy. Sites like upwork are competitive but once you get a few reviews it picks up\r\n\r\nBasic bookkeeping – if youre good with numbers small businesses need help with this constantly. Quickbooks isnt hard to learn\r\n\r\nVirtual assistant work – lots of entrepreneurs need help with random tasks. Not glamorous but steady\r\n\r\nThe faceless tiktok thing the other person mentioned can work but it’s a grind and algorithm dependent. Personally I prefer skills where youre getting paid directly for work not hoping for views\r\n\r\nWhatever you pick, spend the first few weeks actually learning it properly. Youtube has free tutorials for pretty much everything. Then start reaching out to people who need help\r\n\r\nBeing stuck at home is actually perfect for this. No distractions, full focus. A few months is enough time to get decent at something and start making money from it",

Obviously it fluctuates but on average I'd probably make $100-500 a week and spent maybe 10-60mins total per week (sourcing stuff, posting it and meeting people)\n\n\nMy process:\n\n\nUse warehousewatcher.com to find Amazon warehouse deals, alot of that stuff is 40% off + and is in like new condition. If you can't find a buyer you can always return it too.\n\n\nAlso if you go directly on amazon.com enter \"warehouse deals\" in the search field, this also lets you look through their warehouse items, however they've made it increasingly hard to see what's actually in stock without clicking on the item first. Another excellent way to source product is if you're lucky enough to have online auctions with local pickup near you. You'd be surprised how cheap you can get things simpl because you don't have competition.\n\n\nPlaces like maxsold.com list estate sales, auctions etc nearby Also places like canoe.com, keepa.com and camelcamelcamel.com are useful for finding lightning deals to flip as well. Just check camelcamelcamel to see how much it's worth regularly.\n\n\nRules, always meet in public, preferably somewhere you can get to withir 2 mins or less. And never leave until they say they've arrived. This way you don't actually waste any time if people decide to ghost you (which will happen)",

But, I'm getting desperate since I just talked to my mom about getting a bank account to start earning money and we got into a huge fight. Before you say work for neighbors, I'm not allowed :/\n\nI really want to be able to start saving to get out of my house. But right now, my biggest concern is gaining at least a little independence through financial means. Even if that means only 100-300 a month.\n\nSo here's the issue: I don't have a SS number. Yes I have one, but I don't have the documents to use it properly. So I can't earn money through a job or any digital currency apps. I've tried the websites like Swagbucks but once winter break is over I won't have hours upon hours to spend playing mindless games or taking surveys that kick me out after five questions.\n\nIs there any way I can still make money? Sorry if this is a dumb question but I really am getting desperate.",

I appreciate any insights!\n\nI’ve used the below affiliate and referrals and they’ve been genuinely helpful to me in my arena (mostly tech and gaming people). My experience is that some of these can work outside of streaming too (websires, discords for example.).\n\nIf it helps and folks are interested, I can also make this into a Google Sheet for live updates if one doesn’t already exist here. (Not just tech and gaming but more so high return programs)\n\nHopefully this helps fellow streamers and others!\n\nPlease don’t share referral links. Only general links are ok to remain in the rules. If you share please provide the below format too and i can add!\n\nI removed detailed paths; but you can search for/affiliate for more. In the sheet, if allowe, will have direct links to affiliate details (still no personal links).\n\nStreaming Specific\n\n-Streamlabs Sponsorships - Varies (campaign pay) - paid brand deals\n\n-StreamElements Sponsorships - Varies (campaign pay) - in-dashboard offers\n\n-Restream - Up to $49 / upgrade - good for multistreamers\n\n-vidIQ - 15%–25% recurring - YouTube growth tool\n\nSoftware &amp; Tech\n\n-ExpressVPN - Up to $36 per sale - VPN software\n\n-SavePoint Finance - Up to $50 / sale (30–50%) - desktop personal finance app\n\n-monday.com - 25%+ (up to 100% first-year) - useful work program tool\n\nCreatives (good beyond streaming too)\n\n-Envato Market / Elements - 30% first purchase (varies) - overlays + templates\n\n-Adobe - 85% of first month\n\n-Namecheap - 20% domains / 35% hosting - cheap domains convert\n\n-I haven’t used in a while but DreamHost used to have one too!\n\nCashback / referral-style (not “affiliate networks” but still pays)\n\n-Amazon Associates - Varies by category - most of Amazon\n\n-Rakuten - Varies up to $50- one of the original\n\n-Capital One Shopping - Varies up to $80- this one is a hidden gem\n\nOthers I’ve Used\nFactor &amp; Hellofresh - I’ve heard of offers for $30-$50 a pop from different streamers. Not sure if you can sign up independently\n\nAgain let me know if you’d like a spreadsheet we can keep up to date.\n\nPlease share in same format and I will add.

Tell them you just want a credit on the site somewhere that says you made it. Most blue collar guys will eat it up. Think lawn care, handy work, trades, that kind of thing. When you get a few sites worked out, keep them in a portfolio ready to access and then start charging to actually do the better quality work. \n\nI did something similar with my handy work. I work on a few friends and family places for nothing. I just get the before and after photos for my ads. Creativity and deal making goes a long way. The best part about being a web designer is that you’re not limited to a specific service area.

          "body": "Professional create e-books as another means of monetisation, but it's also wise to know that they don't randomly create e-book of just any topics. They likely identified a specific problem that their community has, or questions that kept surfacing, and they created a product in the form of an e-book to solve that problem. Yes they might have already written about it many times, but they're scattered reading like you mentioned. the value for customers is the curations and the buy-in. when they pay for it vs just reading it for free, they are more likely to take it more seriously and take action to work on it, increasing their chances of seeing a better outcome.\n\nI would say that yes, there's a real demand for such things. It's easy to know which topics hit a nerce - those that go viral of have high engagement. that signals that there's interest in it, and usually what professionals do is to expand on that original post in their books (that's the value add).\n\nWith regards to the challenges, the hardest part is distribution, and audience trust. You need someone to sell it to, and they need to trust that you are the subject matter expert in this field.\n\nAnd there's also the point about copywriting. It's unethical to be using someone else's writing to package into a book for your own sale and benefit.\n\nFlipping this idea around, if you identified a niche that you're interested and knowledgeable in, you can approach this with a research, investigative mindset, where you do deep dives into different professionals in the space, their top suggestions, what they say etc, and leverage off people who are interested in this niche. So you become an aggregator of sorts. You don't lift and use their content, but you leverage on the knowledge that they have shared, and their audience. Share the content, and your findings on a weekly basis - 1 expert per week, and generate revenue via ads. e.g if you send a newsletter, every reader is valuable because they can place ads in your newsletter to monitise. It's abit more work, but it's honest work, and you're actually creating something of value that will also last. which is much better and more valuable than an e-book wrapper.",

Most passive income source you can get on youtube. If you really like to make these tutorials, just go for it. Make sure to make long in-depth tutorials and focus on affiliates/digital products/brand deals, and make it a personal channel. This will replace your 9-5 income within 12months probably, because onces these videos rank in google/yt search, they keep making you money for years down the line. From there it is just s numbers game and the views will compound over time. I know people doing 20k steady passively per month with this",

I was about 10% earnings, but now I've sold most of the yielding ETFs and started to buy XGRO, aiming for a long-term return.

You just need to figure out a way to get money in the first place to fund it first. In that sense, you could look into bonus arbitrage (basically like bank churning). You’re essentially exploiting companies that overpay for user acquisition. Like for example, a company pays a $30 bonus for a $10 subscription, which means you can profit $20 in under 2 minutes. \n\nIt won't make you rich, but it’s an easy couple hundred a month that can then funnel into ETFs.

      "selftext": "Merry Christmas and Happy Hols Passive Incomers, \n\nA year ago I set out to build what I thought would be a passive income stream app for players, charities and myself ofc. The idea was simple - an ad funded lottery/sweepstakes game where you don't need to spend money to play you just watch ads. The napkin math seemed solid $0.02 per ad view in the US x 5 ads per day x 100k players = $10k in prizes per day and 5% for me would be great… I released the app, made a post in this sub that blew up and so I thought I’d follow up after a year. Aside from reading the story which I’ll dump in the comments, I’d really appreciate if you could try the app and give me some classic honest reddit feedback! It’s been a bit of a side hustle but my main business dried up recently and so I either need to go all in on this, or start something new!\n\n[**https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=earn.cash.with.ad.millionaire.maker.lottery.bet**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=earn.cash.with.ad.millionaire.maker.lottery.bet)\n\n**Emojingo on Google Play (classic app)**\n\n[**https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=task.emojingo.app&amp;hl=en\\_US**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=task.emojingo.app&amp;hl=en_US)\n\n**Emojingo Tasks on Google Play (higher earnings per ad view in some countries)**\n\n[**https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emojingo-live-play-the-world/id6738431720**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emojingo-live-play-the-world/id6738431720)\n\n**Emojingo on iOS (can’t cashout via app - need to use web dashboard on emojingo.com)**\n\nHere are the Emojingo basics - each advert you watch (5-30s) adds money to the prize pool and generates a ticket for the daily prize draw that I do in TikTok Live [https://www.tiktok.com/@playemojingo](https://www.tiktok.com/@playemojingo) I then take all the money from the ad views and add it to the prize pool (minus 5% for charity and 5% for me) which I then split with the players every day. Any money that is not won, gets rolled over to the next day so we can get a range of big prizes with lower chance of winning and some smaller daily prizes.  \n  \n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/passive\\_income/comments/1gprs9k/made\\_an\\_ad\\_funded\\_lotterysweepstakes\\_app\\_emojingo/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/comments/1gprs9k/made_an_ad_funded_lotterysweepstakes_app_emojingo/)\n\n**The OG post**  \n  \nI’ll dump the rest of the story in the comments",

          "body": "  \nHere’s the TLDR part:\n\n\n\nI got around 10k players immediately after launch and then got hacked right away - built the first app on the client only, thinking that we could move to server if it took. Moral, if you’re doing anything involving rewards or paying money to people, build it robustly with a server even for the MVP.  \n  \nI started building the user base slowly, thinking everything was covered, but some crafty hackers found the one endpoint that we didn’t lock and started exploiting it very gently so I didn’t notice at first but after a while as I couldn’t figure out why the numbers didn’t add up, I tracked him down. Turns out they had a group somewhere and so a couple of hundred people were using this exploit. When we shut them down, they went and collectively dropped a bunch of 1\\* reviews saying we were a scam and Google took down our app. No appeals helped. Moral, robust server, again  \n  \nWe restarted the app, but this time decided to add Earn into the app title because it performed and into the package name. When we started again, we noticed that our ad rates dropped, spend weeks figuring out why, until finally some random Good Samaritan at an ad network told us that Earn is a trigger warning for ad networks and they’ll either outright ban you or dump your rates. Moral, if you’re incentivising ad views in your app, be careful about it and don’t rub it into the ad networks’ face. \n\n\n\nRight around that time, I experimented with screenshots and used another app’s screenshots as inspiration for Gemini to make something similar - it left a small non-copyrighted bit in, but that was enough for another removal. Moral, be careful if you’re recreating screenshots to make sure nothing gets stuck there.  \n  \nWe somehow managed to get out of that one and the app was reinstated, but then our TikTok randomly got banned and then reinstated. People in the know said that our positioning was very lottery like, even though we don’t take any money and it’s pure ads. Moral, TikTok is super sensitive around gambling so be very careful there. Instagram doesn’t really have our target audience but YouTube is good and I suspect Facebook too. ",

You’ve already established that you make as much as your regular job per hour when you’re actively working and building your income stream but what you’re not accounting for is the fact that ‘some’ of that income is passive.\n\nIf you do nothing at all next month you’ll make $100 (ad revenue minus costs).  This is free money and while it’s not forever you could earn it for a long time and although you’re still small you’ve created a saleable asset.  I’m not up to date on what a YouTube channel sells for so someone else feel free to correct me but your channel is worth something like $3,000-$8,000.  \n\nNow if you add that into your hourly wages I bet you see things start to rocket and snowball getting your wages up into the XXX per hour range.  The best part is that you can compound, I don’t know what your growth rate is currently but you have one client now, what’s stopping you from having three by the end of the year?  Let’s grow that ad revenue 10% a month and get you to $500 a month by next year!  \n\nWhat happens when you get to 50k subscribers and you can easily add in another sponsorship stream and double or triple your income because of that added revenue.\n\nYou’re already making more than you would at your day job which is the biggest hurdle to overcome, now it’s smooth sailing to compound that growth.

You won't make much but it's baseline income while you build other stuff. its not much but since I have been consistent its an easy 200-$250 a month with minimal work.\n\nLearn one basic freelance skill. Virtual assistant work is probably fastest since it's mostly scheduling and emails. Watch YouTube tutorials, practice for a few days, then make a Fiverr/upwork profile. Charge low at first just to get reviews.\n\nGrind Fiverr proposals and take whatever gigs you can get. Even if it's $20-30 per gig, do 5-6 of those and you're at $100-150. Combined with survey apps getting you another $50-80, you're around $200.\n\nTo hit $300 you'd need to either land one bigger freelancing gig or sell stuff you own. The $300 range is doable in a month if you hustle. $1000 from zero is basically impossible unless you already have skills or inventory to sell.\n\nWhat skills do you have right now that could translate to freelancing?",

But you can't make passive income in one month anyway.\n\nIf I needed to make $1,000 this month, I would try all of these:\n\n1. House cleaning \n\n2. Childcare\n\n3. Elder care\n\n4. Yard cleanup\n\n5. Window washing \n\n6. Junk removal (I have a truck)\n\n7. Dog poo removal\n\n8. Farm sitting (taking care of livestock, etc.)\n\n9. Establishing gardens for others\n\n10. Decluttering for others\n\nI would advertise in Facebook groups and NextDoor. Busy people need someone to take care of their people and their stuff, and they have money.",

At a younger age I did this with real estate and currently have 4 rentals 3 fully paid off and one with a fairly small mortgage and earn about $100k a year net after all expenses except for renovations.   After I stopped buying real estate in 2013 I put it all in stocks/funds.. It's mostly setup for growth vs income but I still earn about $35k a year in dividends.. separate from stock.  Very little work also on the real estate as I'm in a fairly HCOL and tenants incomes are good and stable as well as they are all professionals..\n\nMorale of story, quickest way always is going to earn a lot of money quick at a young age via growth and \"buy\" your way into passive income.  It's less risky as well since your self funding.\n\nI'll add that not only does these \"assets\" create monthly income they also increase in value and can be substantial.",

There is no such thing as 100% passivity but rather a sliding scale with a tradeoff of energy &amp; returns. If somebody puts say an hour a week into something then it’s absolutely reasonable to consider it to be passive. An author who writes ebooks once and collects royalties for years is still generating mostly passive income, a guy who works one afternoon a week restocking vending machines is still mostly generating passive income, etc. \n\n\nYou are right that you need significant amounts to generate returns with virtually no risk or effort but plenty of people choose a different position in the risk/effort/capital/reward matrix and that’s ok.",

I use Swagbucks and Babki which has both surveys and games. Not exciting but it's baseline income.\n\nSell stuff you don't need on Facebook Marketplace or OfferUp. Even $20-30 from that plus the apps gets you closer. For steadier income, look into remote data entry on Clickworker or Appen. The pay isn't great but it's more reliable than apps. If you have any skills at all, even basic ones, post on r//slavelabour offering services.

Also growing herbs. My best friend grows herbs and has a raspberry bush and she makes 40$ a month selling bundles of freshly grown herbs to local people. The raspberries she makes preserves from in the summer and sells the jam throughout the year. Also selling baked goods is a good way to make a few bucks. \n\nI would also recommend courses on websites like Alison.com and EdX.org. They have courses you can take for free to learn new skills, you only have to pay for a degree or certificate at the end. But even if you don’t buy the certificate or degree, you will still have the skills you learned you just won’t have certification for them. Also, it’s worth asking local places if they will pay you a few bucks for doing tedious work other people don’t want to do such as washing windows and trim, weeding gardens and yards, sweeping the sidewalk, walking pets, or detailing cars and bicycles. \n\nAs someone who grew up very poor, the most important thing is to be resourceful and think outside the box.

It’s not fully passive (I still edit/post/manage versions), but it’s the first thing I’ve built where my back catalog keeps paying after the initial work is done, and that’s a weirdly good feeling.\n\nWhat changed everything for me was going multilingual without turning it into a whole production company. I record once in English, then I make Spanish + Portuguese versions with AI. I’m not really building much infrastructure either — I’m using managed services so I can turn them around fast. I also lean into template-style formats where the structure/visuals are consistent, but the voiceover/script is still original and 60s+, so I can batch multiple languages without reshooting everything.\n\nIt’s not perfect, and I’m honestly surprised it’s working at all.

You make designs once, they sit there, and you get a small cut when someone buys. Won't make much but it's truly passive after the initial upload.\n\nFor online surveys, it's not really passive since you're actively doing tasks. But if you're okay with that, surveys can get you $10-20/month for minimal effort. I make around $300 from them on a monthly basis since I end up doing them almost everyday during my commute to work so it does feel low effort cuz I am not taking time out of my day to do them.

That $26 gives you a crypto (or Bitcoin) miner and access to get paid for doing social media tasks across platforms like X, Reddit, YouTube, and Telegram.\n\nBy earning from both mining and completing simple tasks, I currently make around $15–$20 per week, and that number continues to grow as the account compounds over time. The real value is in letting it run consistently once you’re comfortable with the results, you can easily start cashing out the weekly rewards.

      "selftext": "I want to share something I didn’t even realize was a “passive income” thing until it started paying out.\n\nAbout a month ago, I learned you can upload and license your own voice on platforms like, and creators can use it for narration, videos, audiobooks, etc. I didn’t think much would come of it originally, but I decided to try after learning the setup process from a Skool community I joined from a post i saw here on reddit (mostly creators and AI tinkerers).\n\nOnce the voice was approved i left, and honestly kind of forgot about it. Then payouts started trickling in. Nothing life-changing, but I’m a couple hundred dollars in now, just from people using the voice, and I haven’t touched it since the initial setup.\n\nWhat surprised me most was how front-loaded the work is. Record clean samples, follow the guidelines, upload, and then it just… sits there. Obviously not everyone’s voice will be in demand, but it feels similar to stock photos or music licensing, just with your voice and AI.\n\nI’m curious if anyone else here has tried voice licensing or other AI-adjacent passive income plays like this. And if anyone wants details on how I learned the process, feel free to comment interest in the inbox not sure mods would be cool with links in the comments.\n\nWould love to hear if others are experimenting with this space or think it’s just a short-term thing.",

Everything I found was either buggy or way too expensive for what I needed (most “affordable” tools are still $20–$50/month for basic stuff). So I said screw it, built my own version in a day, and shared it.​\n\nPeople started calling it “the most affordable feedback tool on the internet”. Someone paid, then another… and now there are 9 paying users at a very dumb, very simple price: **1$/month per site**. So right now it’s literally 9 users → 9$/month.\n\nWhat feels crazy to me is not the money, but the timing. TrustMRR stats show that going from 0 → first dollar usually takes around 5 months on average, and I hit that “0 to 1” in a day with a side project.​\n\nA few things this taught me already:\n\n* Scratching your own itch is still underrated.\n* Charging *something* beats waiting for “the perfect launch”.\n* Simple pricing lowers the mental barrier for both builder and buyer.\n\nHappy to answer any questions about how the 9 users came in, pricing, stack, etc.",

You validated real demand by solving your own problem first then kept pricing simple enough that users didn't need to think about it. The fact that you hit revenue in a day while your main startup is taking longer probably says something about product-market fit too.

Most people around here seem to have a low opinion of certifications.\n\n5- Any recommendations on which job sites I should frequent? I'm doing mostly linkedin and indeed, and trying to get very easy jobs for low pay on Upwork, to build some trust of my profile.\n\nPlease share your wisdom!\n\nAnd p.s. this online job finding thing is really wacky on your mental status.

Also tailwinds communities feature exposed my pins to thousands more people organically.\n\nSmartpin feature generates multiple design variations automatically which saves insane amounts of time vs designing everything from scratch in canva. I compared pins made with smartpin vs canva and tbh they performed about the same so now I mostly use smartpin cause its way faster.\n\nThings that surprised me: pinterest traffic converts better than google traffic for affiliate offers, people are already in research/buying mode. Comparison posts (Product A vs Product B) get 2x more saves than generic roundup posts. Vertical pins crush square pins, not even close.\n\nChallenges: Takes 4-6 weeks to see real momentum so don't expect instant results. Pinterest algorithm is inconsistent, some pins randomly go viral and others flop for no clear reason. Tailwind cost adds up but ROI makes it worth it once traffic scales\n\nFocusing on pinterest instead of just SEO was probably the best decision I made for this site, google is so saturated now in most niches anyway.",

We cleaned up one YC company's codebase and suddenly had 3 more reaching out within weeks.\n\n\n\nFew things that helped us scale this:\n\n\\- Document everything you fix (we use notion to track all the anti-patterns we find)\n\n\\- Get testimonials immediately while the pain is fresh\n\n\\- Focus on specific tech stacks - we only do React/Node shops now\n\n\n\nThe demand is insane right now. So many teams rushed to ship with AI tools and now they're paying the price. We're using Cloudastra Technologies for our cloud infrastructure since we need to spin up test environments quickly for each client cleanup.\n\n\n\nKeep pushing on the YC angle - that network effect is real.",

Had little tangible skills so I started an apprenticeship with a local union at age 30 with the thought of working my way into the office as a PM someday. I now have zero desire to do that...the PM's at my medium-sized company make over 200k+/year but never stop working, and I know that's kind of the industry norm. Figured if I'm going to work all the time, might as well work for myself instead of making someone else rich.\n\nI'm now 32 and diversifying my skillsets with the intention to start my own business totally unrelated to construction. Best case scenario, by the time I finish my apprenticeship I will have a successful/growing business on the side that I can turn into a full-time gig. \n\nWorst case scenario, the business doesn't take off like I hoped but I'll still be a union journeyman making decent money. I'll make a living while I figure out my next adventure. \n\nI know you didn't ask for advice, but since we come from similar backgrounds and are the same age I feel compelled to share something I've been struggling/realizing lately: Reading self-help books is good but it will never replace actually doing \"the thing\", know what I mean? Those books make us feel good and artificially better for reading them, but they mean nothing if we don't practice their teachings. Don't get caught in that trap like I did. \n\nGood luck brother.",

I kept trying to cut corners, but when I stopped doing that and just worked hard and put myself out of my comfort zone, I succeeded. \n\nHandyman business sounds credible and doable.

The fact that you are reading daily, thinking in terms of skills and ideas, and already investing puts you ahead of many people who look “established” on the surface.\n\nI did not come from a strong educational background either. I learned most things by doing, failing, and restarting. I have had businesses that worked, then collapsed completely. At one point I went back to zero financially. What kept me moving was not some big breakthrough idea, but stacking skills that could transfer across industries.\n\nOne thing I would suggest is to focus less on hit or miss ideas at the beginning and more on skills that directly tie to cash flow. Property maintenance is a great example because it solves a real problem and people pay for that consistently. Once you have steady income, experimenting with games, music, or ebooks becomes way less stressful.\n\nI work in video editing, social media management, and media buying, and one thing I see constantly is that businesses do not need genius ideas. They need people who can execute, communicate, and stay consistent. Those are learnable skills, not things tied to formal education. I learned most of it online, through practice and working with small business owners.\n\nAlso, do not underestimate your construction background. It already gives you discipline, problem solving, and work ethic. You are not starting from scratch, you are pivoting.\n\nMany people who “made it” later did not have a straight path. They just kept moving, learning, and adjusting. If you keep building practical skills and stay patient, things do compound, even if it does not feel like it year to year.\n\nYou are not late. You are just early in the part where it feels messy and uncertain.",

Most people who actually build something real do it in their 30s or later, especially people without safety nets. You already have savings, income, work ethic, and ideas, that puts you ahead of a lot of people. Construction is not a weakness either, it gives you practical skills and a fallback, which reduces risk. The biggest mistake is thinking you need to “find the perfect idea” before starting. Pick one practical thing first, like property maintenance, get it cash flowing, then experiment with the higher risk ideas on the side.",

          "body": "I'll weigh in on this. I have nothing more than a high school education, and I completely shifted industries that I was working in, back when I was 32. My entire work history up until age 32 had absolutely *zero* relevance to the industry that I went into (real estate sales and property management, and property maintenance). For context, I am now nearly 50, and own &amp; operate two businesses; one of which is a handyman/remodeling business. \n\nI am still the key driver in each business, so I have a good ways to go; given that the goal is to build something that can function for weeks or months at a time without me around. I currently own my own jobs, and am not yet officially a \"business owner\" or \"entrepreneur\". I like to think that I'm on the right path, but have not \"made it\" yet. \n\nSo I've been toiling away for 18 years on this, so far. I've made some insanely big mistakes, that set back my progress in some significant ways. But I've also had some good fortune and not-so-bad decisions.\n\nMy short take on it: you have *plenty* of time to create huge success. And given your work experience and financial savings, you are better positioned than I was at your age. Time is definitely on your side. \n\nTo use the poker analogy: it sounds like you have a very good hand. Not an AMAZING hand, but a very good hand. If you play that hand super well, you could crush it. If you play the had moderately well, then you'll do pretty good. And if you play it poorly... well, you know.  \n\nAre you listening to the Contractor Evolution podcast? That's a good one, in my opinion, if property maintenance is definitely the direction that you want to go. \n\nAnother thought on property maintenance: you'll need to decide on whether you want to be self employed and doing the work yourself, or if you want to be running a business with employees. I've known a lot of self employed contractors that are doing far better financially than the small business owners. In my observation, there is a lot of success to be realized for the independent operator as well as the mid-to-large business owner; but the grey area in between... the small business owner... often struggles. That's because having a couple company trucks and employees requires a lot of time, energy, and money, and the profit margin on only having a couple of employees is barely enough to make it viable. So to make that business model a success, you have to get past that tipping point. \n\nAll of that is to say: being an independent owner/operator is a completely different paradigm from owning a business that has an office manager, service technicians, trucks, warehouse/office space, etc, etc. Both options can be financially successful, but they require vastly different skillsets, and you need to decide for yourself which option you want for yourself.",

      "selftext": "I just finished watching Alex's new \"26 Lessons\" video. It’s long, but honestly, there were some gems in there that hit pretty hard. I took notes for myself and figured I’d drop them here to save you guys the time.\n\nHere you go:\n\n**On Mindset &amp; Psychology**\n\n* **Fear lives in the vague.** If you’re scared, write down the absolute worst-case scenario in detail. Usually, it’s just \"sleeping on a friend's couch,\" not dying. Once it’s on paper, it’s not scary.\n* **Mental Toughness &gt; Motivation.** He breaks toughness down into: How much bad stuff can you take? How low do you get? How fast do you bounce back? And do you come back better?\n* **The \"Heavyweight Champion\" move is doing nothing.** When someone insults you or triggers you, your gut wants to punish them. But usually, doing nothing is the only move that actually gets you what you want (them going away).\n* **Think for yourself.** Most people are just picking \"identity packages\" off the shelf (Hipster, Redneck, etc) and adopting those beliefs. If you can't explain why you believe something, it's not your thought.\n* **It's okay to just make money.** Don't fall for the \"Third Marshmallow\" trap where you delay gratification until you're dead. At some point, you have to reap what you sowed.\n\n**On Business Strategy &amp; Growth**\n\n* **No \"New\" Stuff.** New is risky. The hierarchy is: Do **More** of what works &gt; Do it **Better** \\&gt; Do something **New** (only as a last resort). He only allows himself one new big project a year.\n* **Plan life first.** Once you have money, you’re paid for judgment, not hours. So prioritize sleep and an empty calendar. Let business fill the cracks, not the other way around.\n* **Ignorance isn't a defense.** Learn the laws and contracts. \"Lawyer stuff\" eats your brainpower if you don't understand the rules of the game.\n* **The Founder's Will.** The biggest risk isn't running out of cash, it's the founder just not wanting to do it anymore. You need a \"why\" that survives past the point where the money is \"enough.\"\n\n**On Team &amp; Leadership (The harsh truths)**\n\n* **The Leader is always the problem.** If a department sucks, the leader sucks. Period.\n* **A-Players or nothing.** You know if someone is an A-Player in the first 14 days. If you don't know by then, they aren't one. Cut them.\n* **A-Players hate B-Players.** If you keep mediocre people, your stars will leave.\n* **Hard conversations save millions.** If you can't have a tough talk when stakes are low (contracts), you guarantee a lawsuit when stakes are high.\n* **Delegation is painful.** The spiritual path of entrepreneurship is constantly giving up control. \"Scale Zero\" means if a task requires you, it’s broken.\n\n**On Marketing &amp; Brand**\n\n* **The Offer is King.** You can't out-market a bad offer. A good offer makes people feel stupid saying no. (Razor: Can you pitch it in a text message and get a \"yes\"? If not, it's too complex).\n* **Clear &gt; Clever.** No one is listening. You have to repeat yourself until you die.\n* **Brand is the Moat.** In an AI world, execution is commoditized. Who people trust is the only defense. Give away the secrets, sell the implementation.\n* **Volume wins.** You need thousands of ad creatives. He used like 5,000 variations for his book launch.\n\nP.S. Add yours - let's make a mega thread which is packed with value for all.",

The whole performative productivity thing. And I was miserable and Ailog, the business wasn't even growing that fast.\n\nThe breaking point was a Thursday afternoon when I sat at my desk for 3 hours and literally couldn't make myself do anything. Just stared at the screen. Brain completely empty. I thought something was medically wrong with me.\n\nTalked to a therapist. She asked me what I did for fun. I couldn't answer. Asked me when I last took a day completely off. Couldn't remember. Asked me if I actually enjoyed running this business. I started crying which was embarrassing but also clarifying.\n\nHere's the thing nobody tells you. Productivity systems are designed for people who aren't working enough. If you're already working too much, optimizing your work just means you burn out more efficiently.\n\nWhat actually helped was cutting my hours. Not optimizing them. Cutting them. I went from 70 to 45. Felt terrifying at first. Felt like I was abandoning the business. But the business didn't notice. Revenue kept growing at roughly the same rate. Some things just didn't get done and turns out they didn't need to get done.\n\nThe 25 hours I got back went to sleep, exercise, seeing friends, and just existing as a human. My actual productive output during the 45 hours is now higher than it was during the 70. I can think clearly again. I can make decisions. I don't dread Monday anymore.\n\nMore hours isn't more output. It's just more hours.\n\nAnyone else been through something similar?",

I worked previously as a chef so working crazy hours was never a problem but building two business in tandem has been a lesson on consistency not all out working. We're building a food manufacturing business as well as a seasonal restaurant division that travels to different destinations.

Optimization doesn't feel like the right move. It feels like as I have less and less time my mood and self care just drops significantly. The only respite comes from crashing on a \"day off\" which is more like an admin day from home or having to take time off for a wedding of life events etc.\n\nBuilding a business is so much harder than people realize and most of the advice I find doesn't tell you that it's just an uphill struggle that sometimes feels like shit for a long time with no guarantee you're going to succeed.",

      "selftext": "If you are in your late teens or early twenties, chances are you have felt it: a quiet but persistent sense that life is slipping by without real direction. You have ambitions like achieving financial freedom, building a family one day, giving back through charity, or simply having deep, reliable friendships. But somehow, the drive to make those things happen fades quickly. Motivation comes in waves, and the only time you feel truly alive and excited is during short escapes that leave you emptier afterward. You know you should get serious, start building habits, and chase what matters, but purpose feels out of reach. You are not alone in this. Millions of young people today wrestle with the same emptiness, and there is a clear reason why it has become so common.\n\nSomething fundamental changed around the early 2000s. Before that time, most people discovered their interests through living. You would go out into the world, experience something directly, feel a spark of curiosity, and then actively seek out more information using whatever tools existed. Schools, conversations with mentors, libraries, trial and error. Your path felt self-directed because it grew naturally from your own encounters and choices. You ended up where you were because you chose to go there.\n\nToday the flow runs in the opposite direction. Information floods toward you constantly through phones and screens, carefully selected and pushed by algorithms, companies, and hidden agendas. Interests are handed to you ready-made instead of discovered through experience. Attention gets captured before you even decide what you care about. Over time, this reverses the natural order: curated content shapes your desires, pulls your focus outward, and leaves you in a life that often feels like it belongs to someone else. The constant noise drowns out your own voice, making it hard to know what you truly want or why anything matters.\n\nThis reversal explains the widespread feeling of being stuck. When everything competes for your attention, nothing feels worth giving it to. Quick dopamine hits from scrolling, gaming, or other escapes become the only reliable source of excitement because they are designed to deliver instant reward. Meanwhile, the slower rewards of building skills, relationships, or long-term goals feel distant and uncertain. Purpose requires space, reflection, and ownership, but the modern environment leaves little room for any of those.\n\nThe way out starts with reclaiming control, one small step at a time. Begin by creating quiet moments each day to listen to yourself. Ask basic questions: What activities absorb me completely? What kind of person do I respect and want to become? Write the answers down honestly. This simple habit cuts through the external chatter and helps you reconnect with your inner direction.\n\nFrom there, pick one small action that moves you toward a goal you care about and do it daily. Ten minutes of reading about money management if financial freedom matters to you. A short walk or workout if you want to feel stronger. Consistency builds momentum far better than occasional bursts of effort. When distractions pull you away, notice it without harsh judgment and gently return to what you chose.\n\nSeek real-world connections that support growth. Join groups, clubs, or online communities built around shared interests. Show up as yourself, contribute, and listen. Authentic friendships and mentors appear when you engage steadily over time, not when you chase quick bonds.\n\nIf excitement only shows up in unhealthy ways right now, experiment with healthier sources. Try physical challenges, creative outlets, volunteering, or time in nature. These activities can awaken the same energy in sustainable forms.\n\nHelpful starting points include books such as Atomic Habits by James Clear for building reliable routines, or Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl for understanding purpose in difficult seasons. Free courses on platforms like Coursera or Khan Academy let you explore skills without pressure. Mindfulness apps can train your mind to stay present amid the noise.\n\nProgress will feel slow at first, and that is normal. Be patient as you rebuild the habit of directing your own life. By stepping away from endless feeds and toward deliberate choices, you create space for genuine meaning to emerge. Many have walked this path before you and found their way forward. You can too. The life you actually want is still within reach, waiting for you to start choosing it.",

          "body": "This describes something I have felt for a long time but never really had words for.\n\nFor me the “lost” feeling did not come from a lack of information. If anything I had too much of it. I knew what I should be doing, saving money, building skills, working on something meaningful. The problem was I never turned any of that into real action.\n\nWhat helped was not a big mindset shift but doing small things in the real world and sticking with them longer than the initial excitement. Building something tiny. Testing an idea. Even failing at it. That process gave me more clarity than months of thinking or consuming content ever did.\n\nAt some point I realised purpose does not show up first and then action follows. It is usually the other way around. You act first and meaning slowly forms around it.\n\nOne small thing that helped me move from vague ambition to actual doing was looking at real problems instead of abstract goals. I came across **StartupIdeasDB** while browsing ideas and what stood out was how specific and grounded the problems were. It made starting feel less overwhelming.\n\nYour point about algorithms shaping desire is very real. When everything is constantly pushed at you, it is hard to know what you actually care about. Doing something on your own, even if it is boring or imperfect, gives that sense of ownership back.\n\nThanks for writing this. Posts like this are rare and needed.",

I figured it'd be easier than hunting thrift stores every weekend. Half the sellers dont even have accurate inventory counts. I placed an order for 50 phone cases last month and the guy messages me 3 days later saying he only has 38 left. Then I had to wait another week for a partial refund because apparently thats just how it works. Second issue is quality control is basically nonexistent when buying in bulk. I ordered what was supposed to be brand new chargers and when I got them half had scratches and looked like returns.  Theres no way to see all the variants side by side or check all the product photos in one view so Im literally opening like 15 tabs trying to figure out which supplier has the best deal. Sometimes items are already sold out by the time I decide and I cant even buy directly through any kind of bulk ordering system, its just regular checkout which is annoying when youre trying to move fast. Would love to hear if anyone cracked this.",

Since i started getting sunlight (or staring at a lamp) my overall capacity and stability levels have increased dramatically.  \n\nAlso, 1 hour \"buffer\" time - my time, first thing in the morning. Walk alone in silence with my own thoughts, meditate, journal a bit. Clear my head, reorient on what matters the most, while trying to avoid obsessing about it (yeah, I know). If I start skipping this or cutting it short, my performance and quality of life start inching down. 100%.\n\nNo gadgets, obviously, but if I were you I'd push gadgets at least until noon, if not even past 1-2pm. If there's something truly critical or urgent they will get a hold of, don't worry. Shield your damn energy and focus, that's the only things you've truly got. Time has no value if you have attention span of a toddler.\n\nShare your experience.\n\n",

And I slowed down by choice, not by force.\n\nBurnout being a function of hours is a myth; its a function of alignment. \n\nYou dont have to love what you. Hell, you dont even have to have a passion for it, per se. You just need to deeply understand why youre doing it.\n\nTheres no magic bullet for drive, but here's what I've learned after building an 8 figure business as a result:\n\n1. Routines aren't enough. Rituals are everything. Routines can be broken, rituals cannot be compromised. For 12 years I wore essentially the same outfit every day, went to sleep at the same time, got up at the same time, ate the same things, etc. This wasnt because I enjoyed it, it was because it spared the energy thinking about shit like that, and allowed me to focus on building, working, creating.\n\n2. Health is key. The healthier you are, the more you can sustain. In the early years I drank a lot (part of my ritual 😬) but as the years went on and I began to get more intentional about my health, the days got easier. \n\n3. Have a goal (or goals). Affirmations, vision boards, mission statements, etc... I dont care what medium works best for you just understand why youre busting your ass so hard. And remind yourself every day.\n\n4. Finally, measure progress by months or years, never by days. If you try to measure progress by the day working like that you'll get discouraged, overwhelmed, and just shut down. But if you can look back on the years to see how far you've come, tomorrow has more purpose.\n\nIm sure theres more but thats what I can think off the top of my head. \n\nAt the end of the day you must answer:\n\nHow bad do you want it?\n\nAnd what are you willing to sacrifice to get it?\n\nBonus: Whats *really* important to you? \n\nMy two cents.",

This is also the case in the winter, but I go for half a block. Adjust timing as it suits you, some people do really well using a pomodoro cycle.\n\n- Context switch. This is super important. Never wear clothes that you would normally wear around the house. At least wear jeans and a decent shirt/hoodie. Don’t wear joggers, sweatpants, etc. Save that for when you’re done with your work. \n\n- If you listen to some kind of content, use headphones that are tethered to your desk. I consider this part of my context switch. In ear monitors work especially well for me because they’re sort of annoying to take off/on. This adds another barrier to just getting up and going to do something else. You can get really good ones that sound better than all of the expensive wireless buds/phones I’ve ever used for like $50. Simgot ew200.\n\n- I’ve caught flack for this, but it works, and there’s nothing that suggests that this will produce problems long-term. When I’m making a big push, I work in an entirely dark environment except for my screens. Doing this makes it hard to even want to do anything else that day. I don’t know if this applies for other people, but I heard about it first from Alex Hormozi, and he seems to have similar things to say. But if it gives you headaches or you can feel eye strain, don’t be an idiot. Use other strategies.\n\n\nAdditionally, have bipolar disorder, medicated to the point that it’s manageable. Mood swings are not nearly as intense and debilitating as they once were. Through mood tracking and watchings signs of swings, I can harness the good parts of hypomanic swings and get an obscene amount of work done, so that’s part of my strategy. These overall strategies can apply to all phases of my mood, and their effectiveness generally follows suit. Depressive episodes are possible to do this with, but I usually get less done and I am more easily distracted.",

So to the, they’re “always” working.\n\nLast thing: OP you may not realize it but you’re perpetuating the bullshit too. “What’s your secret” implies working this much is impressive. That it’s aspirational. \n\nIt’s not. And if baffles me how many of you drink the kool aid. Most of you got into entrepreneurship to achieve freedom. To not “have a boss.” To not be controlled. Yet you celebrate those who work nonstop? That’s insane. That’s the opposite of freedom. \n\nA better question would be: for those of you who have successful companies/entrepreneurial careers, and did it WITHOUT killing yourself, what’s your secret?",

      "selftext": "I'm 25f, recently opened a marketing agency with my husband and we're expecting to make a good amount of money very soon which is great. I know the title sounds a little dramatic but I could genuinely use some advice especially if you're a bit older and a business owner. I married my husband a year and a half ago, left my country and moved to his, literally into his childhood bedroom. We're together 24/7, working 24/7. No weekends off. I haven't seen my family/friend for like 6 months and they don't even know what we're doing because we don't like to talk about it before we're successful. Actually, I didn't even talk to my dad in around 6 months but thats a different story. As you can probably imagine at this point, our social life is basically dead. \nTime really flies so I don't even really get the time to think about all the things I don't have time for, all I get is exactly 2,5 hours of break at night and that's barely enough to watch some show just to get my mind to stop thinking about work. \n\nWhen my family calls me at random times I almost get annoyed at them for thinking I have time to talk when all I can think of is how to get stuff done. I'm not sure if anyone can relate but my family history is quite diffcult. Addiction and depression, money issues and all of that stuff so running away from that to actually build something that could potentially solve my families problems is what gives everything I do a meaning. Is this something anyone else experiences? And if so, how the f do you deal with it? I don't really wanna make time for anything else but at the same time I feel like people are starting to build resentment because I make them feel like I don't care when it's the opposite. \n\n\nEdit: A lot if you are basically saying \"just talk to them\" which yeah ofc makes sense lol it's family. But I guess not everyone comes from my background so I'll elaborate. I got two bipolar brothers that are both thousands in depth and a bipolar alcoholic unemployed dad with a god complex that was absent for 15 years of my life and lives in a \"third world\" country with another family which means I have another brother thats 14 years old that I feel responsible for. My mom is probably the most normal but even she used to be gone travelling around the world with strange men when I was 14. So talking to my family isn't just a quick nice chat it's usually stressful. It's not even that we argue, but there's always a problem. Money, mental health or someone's about to become homeless LOL. It's not that easy to focus on work and be in contact with them without getting dragged into some Bs. I hope that helps to understand my situation. ",

Replace this with walks or healthy meal prep or reading a book. \n\n2. As soon as you can, hire staff to help reduce the burden. Even before you start making “a good amount of money”. \n\n3. You and your partner should both go out one night a week. Together or even better apart. You don’t have to spend much. But that bedroom will do you in. \n\n4. Remember that your doing today what other people won’t so that you can have tomorrow what other people can’t. I sacrificed much of my 20s into\nmy businesses, but today I have it better than most. \nThere is no balance in the beginning. Don’t listen to the part time “life coaches” that tell you there should be. But try to squeeze in a little bit of personal time. This is where your aha moments come from. Kind of like finding your keys when you stop looking so hard for them. \n\n5. Eat as healthy as you can. Bad food leads to low energy and less than ideal states of mind. \n\n6. Your why is VERY powerful. Print it out and put it up on your wall along with anything else you want. Your partner could do the same. Smile every time you look at it and imbue it with emotion. \n\n7. Talk to your family during your 2.5hrs. You can combine this with walking or meal prepping. When they ask what you’re doing, just let them know you’ll tell them when the time is right.\n\nAnd in the words of Tim Ferris: “Find joy and delight in everything you do”\n\nYou’ve got this!!",

Instead of creating drama by shutting people out, how about simply telling people you are working on building a business, which is taking up a lot of time, so forgive you for going dark from time to time. You don’t have to talk about it, and you can even say you want to keep it confidential for now until the biz gains traction. I am sure your family and real friends will understand and give you space. They might even drop an occasional note to cheer you on. It’s called communicating and setting expectations, while pulling your eyes away from you mobile devices.

Holding everything in, not sharing wins or struggles, and carrying the weight alone for too long.\n\nYou're not broken. You're not selfish. You're in a very intense chapter.

Ofc they can’t do that so much, that you can’t focus on it. But yes you do need to talk to them, when they need it and maybe even you too.

They’ll eventually understand, maybe. But you do need to understand it’s your life, so do you. If they try to stop you by time draining then that’s another story then they aren’t your family they are an enemy. But if they care about you, they want to spend time with you and support you. Also it will help make your journey a tiny better. It’s just money and work. For some it’s a way out, for others it’s a way of supporting or other situations, we all have our motivations for why. But you could end up building bad feelings as a byproduct if they feel like they are a burden to your work. But again it depends on the situation, from an visionary perspective. Do you, but don’t ruin your family if they care and love you. That’s stupid. But also practically some people actually don’t need that much time if we boil it down. But you do need to enjoy each other’s company when together and make quality time. And remember money have ruined a lot of families. Don’t say it will, but be careful.

Nurturing important relationships is so important, because if not then you're left with money that you can only do so much with and you and up feeling all alone and sad. Some people even said their partners in relationships left from the distance it created. You're seeing your partner 24/7, that's not healthy either. You need something of your own to come back and share about it. I read about these in the subs whether wealthy people talk about net worth I think it's called FatFire? Or just FIRE?",

Here’s the breakdown of their sales operating system:\n\n\n\n1. Pre-call qualification (this is where most teams bleed time)\n\nThey don’t let everyone book.  \nCalls only get booked if the prospect is a real fit. Qualification happens automatically through:\n\n* Smart inbound routing\n* Short VSL-style videos before booking\n* Website pages that pre-educate the buyer\n* LinkedIn connection automation for long-term nurture\n\nOutcome:  \nClosers talk only to real buyers. Time-wasters are filtered before a human ever gets involved.\n\n\n\n2. Discovery &amp; research (without manual prep)\n\nBefore every call, the rep already knows:\n\n* Funding stage\n* Company size\n* Who the real decision-maker is\n* Strategic initiatives\n* Recent hiring signals\n* Timing indicators\n\nAll of this is auto-aggregated and summarized before the call even happens.   \nSo when the rep joins, they’re already fully briefed, without spending 45 minutes digging.\n\n\n\n3. Follow-up &amp; nurturing (where most revenue is actually won)\n\nMost prospects don’t buy on the first call. Their follow-up stack runs:\n\n* Automated value-driven follow-ups\n* Personalized video follow-ups (not just text spam)\n* Multi-threading across LinkedIn to hit all stakeholders\n\nNo “just checking in.”  \nNo chasing ghosts.   \nNo pipeline rotting.\n\n\n\n4. Why this closed $966K in one month\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, the leverage came from 4 things:\n\n* Only qualified buyers reach closers\n* Prospects arrive educated (less friction, faster decisions)\n* Automation removes admin from the sales cycle\n* Content warms people up before they ever talk to sales\n\n\n\nThat’s how they turned attention into real pipeline, and $966K ARR in 30 days.\n\nIf you were running this system, what would you improve or change first to squeeze out more revenue?",

      "selftext": "I started this team not too long ago and we’re still small, just nine people. At first, I felt like managing others was pulling me away from actually doing the work, so I tried to get more disciplined about it. I read up on management, borrowed parts of the systems I’d seen at my previous company, and adapted them to fit our size, hoping that a bit more structure would make things feel under control.\n\nBut as the number of projects keeps growing, I’ve started to realize that the chaos isn’t just coming from team management. A lot of it is my own project management and work habits. My days are full of short meetings, Slack notifications, quick syncs, consulting calls, client updates, and random “can we jump on a call right now?”. None of these things are useless on their own, but together they completely shatter my focus.\n\nWhat really shook me was a day last week when I had seven meetings, all under 30 minutes. By the end of the day, I was exhausted, but when I tried to look back and figure out what we had actually decided, everything felt blurry. I knew I had agreed to things, but without digging through messages and notes, I couldn’t clearly remember the reasons, who owned what, or the ddl. There are just too many decisions happening every day, and it feels like my brain can’t keep up with my calendar anymore. The more tired I get, the worse my efficiency becomes.\n\nSo I wanted to ask leaders who’ve been doing this longer than I have, how do you turn all this incoming information into a system that actually works for you? How do you make sure important things don’t fall through the cracks when your work is so fragmented? I feel like I’m constantly missing things, and I’m hoping to learn how others deal with this before it burns me out completely.",

          "body": "You are definitely not alone in this. What you are describing is less about workload and more about cognitive overload. When decisions, context, and follow ups are scattered across meetings, Slack, notes, and emails, your brain becomes the system of record. That is what burns people out fast.\n\nOne thing that helped me a lot was separating “thinking” work from “capturing” work. Every meeting, call, or sync needs a single place where decisions, owners, and next steps are written down immediately. Not perfect notes, just outcomes. If it is not written, it does not exist. Over time, this alone reduces the mental load because you stop trying to remember everything.\n\nAnother big shift is limiting where work can show up. Slack, meetings, and quick calls feel harmless individually, but together they destroy focus. I started pushing everything into a small number of async updates and weekly checkpoints. Fewer meetings, but with clear agendas and clear outputs. If a meeting does not end with decisions and owners, it was not worth having.\n\nIt also helps to move from managing tasks to managing decisions. Tasks change constantly, but decisions are what actually matter. I keep a simple decision log that answers three questions: what was decided, why, and who owns the follow up. When things get blurry later, I do not have to reconstruct history from messages.\n\nFinally, give yourself permission to slow the input. Growth often adds chaos faster than systems can handle. It is okay to pause new projects, say not yet, or batch decisions. Efficiency does not come from doing more, it comes from reducing the number of things competing for attention.\n\nBurnout usually shows up when your system no longer matches the complexity of your role. Fixing the system is not a personal failure, it is leadership work.",

      "selftext": "I’m a small business owner and professional dog groomer. I recently bought a high-end professional high-velocity dryer for about $760. After receiving it, I had some first-impression concerns and reached out to the company to talk through them and possibly return it.\n\nInstead of troubleshooting or pushing back at all, they immediately refunded me in full and told me to keep the unit. No discussion. Just “refund processed, you don’t need to send it back.”\n\nHere’s the unexpected part: after actually using it under real workload, the thing is phenomenal. Faster dry times, insane airflow, doesn’t bog down under resistance. It’s objectively better than some legacy brands I’ve used for years and clearly a serious professional tool with solid internals.\n\nAnother detail: this was the last unit they had available directly. All distributors I checked are quoting 5 to 6 week lead times on new stock.\n\nSo now I’m sitting here with a $760 piece of equipment that I didn’t pay for, is actively improving my day-to-day operations, and would easily pay for itself many times over. I didn’t ask for a comp, didn’t threaten a chargeback, didn’t exaggerate issues. I genuinely just wanted to talk through concerns and possibly return it.\n\nAs a small business owner myself, the whole situation feels… weird. Objectively, it’s a win. But it also feels morally awkward because that wasn’t my intent, and I know what margins can look like for smaller manufacturers.\n\nHas anyone else had something like this happen where the outcome is great, but it still feels uncomfortable? Or is this just one of those “accept the good luck and move on” situations?",

With a refund and return shipping I can imagine it became negative profit for them as others mentioned. Sometimes for bigger items they have you destroy a key functional part rendering the item inoperable, or send back some proof of destruction—- or at least pics of it smashed for disposal. Unfortunately similar to a donut shop pouring bleach on expired product at night die to “health code issues” instead of donating expired/soon to expire product for consumption by others. In France bread shops are required to donate day-old bread to charities.",

Maybe they did the math based on previous support calls and said you're more likely to cost them more on support than the unit is worth. So you may feel you got a windfall, but they felt that they dodged a bullet.\n\nDon't feel tempted to give them the $760 in another way - you won't get the support back. Generally when companies do this though they would also ask you to send pictures of you destroying the unit (cut off the cord or something) so it also absolve them from liability and lower their insurance rates.

I can actually make a case that people who want to be in management sometimes ignore that having responsibility over employees isn't as empowering sa they think as they in some cases become baby sitters. Sometimes having a boss(and it has to be the right boss) is much better tha being the boss\n\nand lastly, one thing I can say from experience(and I'm a person who has been self employeed most of my adult life)..the 5-6 years I worked for someone, I'm not complaining about my current situation. I'm happy, I'm content...but I'm also more lazy than I hsould be(though my customers and employees are ALWAYS taken care of)..look, I'm on reddit at work? That is crazy.\n\n  \nso I was a music major in college and at one time was a pretty good musician(not I'm just fine)..but one reason GREAT musicians might study with an teacher(getting private lessons) isn't because they aren't able to record themselves and hear what they did right or wrong...but rather because a teacher keeps them honest\n\n  \nI do alright. My business is sitting pretty well(of course it isn't as if I don't have concerns about what the future holds but it has been awhile since I've really been stressed out about cash flow and overall business is decent...but I'll get a little anxiety in the middle of january as this is my slow time of year and I don't lay anyone off and it is sometimes hard keeping them all busy..but anyway)\n\n  \nI'm a hard worker and I think I'm a good boss and I was a GREAT employee. That being said it doesnt' take much to convince me to take off work a little early somedays...or take a friday off. Like I said, I'll take care of all my customers and my employees but there are always things I could be doing that are more productive when it comes to growing my business. I don't put off things i HAVE to do but I could be working on a project today that would help me boost revenue. I'm giving my employees the rest of the week off(i actually do have things that they could do in Friday...but it isnt' time sensitive.\n\n  \nmy point is if I had that teacher keeping me honest and making sure I was doing some of the things that would probably benefit my business..I'd probably be selling more but times have been decent so it has been kinda easy to take that extra time off where as some people would probably keep me more on taast",

This particular factor, is not a threat. \n\nCan you imagine not just losing a sale, but losing $1,200 in shipping, on top of the $1,200 sale or, spending an additional $800 to lose a $1,200 product, trying to satisfy someone, who cannot be satisfied AND they still leave a bad review... Just because that's the type of person they are?\n\nThe product was in high demand and short supply and, I could tell which customer was going to be a pain in the ass/loss, before they even spent their money... Maybe it's not great customer service but, if I had to choose the potential customer who called once, with some basic questions, prior to purchase, who was clearly going to love and know how to use it properly, vs. the person who called 4 times, to hem and haw over how expensive it is, wasting hours of my time, demanding a discount, \"I offered you 10% off. No I cannot make shipping free. It costs $450.\n And we only charge $200,\" while having no experience with or understanding of how said product works, I know whose order I should be cancelling or, at least not digging a deeper financial hole to China, in an attempt to make them happy. \n\nThe written policy was, \"if it has been used. It is not returnable.\" We can help you fix it but, we can't fix you. Literally every person begging for a discount, had buyers remorse and wanted to return it or, insisted it was broken and unfixable... We replace it once and maybe get the original back, to find, after all the technical support and replacement demands, they never even took it out of the box.",

I was completely unprepared for the business side of things inventory management, pricing, marketing, dealing with suppliers.\nThe jewelry-making part is still enjoyable, but it's now only about twenty percent of my actual work. The rest is answering emails, managing social media, tracking expenses, dealing with shipping issues, and trying to convince people my pieces are worth the prices I'm charging.\nLast week, someone asked why my necklace cost sixty dollars when they saw \"\"similar ones\"\" for ten dollars elsewhere. I tried explaining handmade quality versus mass production, but they just walked away. It's discouraging to have your work undervalued constantly.\nI've been sourcing some materials from Alibaba to keep costs manageable, which helps with margins, but I worry about maintaining quality while staying competitive on price. Finding that balance is exhausting.\nI'm starting to understand why so many small businesses fail in the first year. The romantic idea of being your own boss crashes hard against the reality of uncertain income and constant problem-solving. Some days I miss my old job security. Other days, I'm proud of every sale I make.\n\n",

Or is it just handmade? \n\nIf it’s not higher, then I’d consider NOT trying to compete with the $10 necklaces. Actually make higher quality items and price them accordingly. Your target market isn’t customers buying $10 garbage. It’s customers interested in a higher quality product and willing to pay more for it. The key is you have to actually make it higher quality. \n\nThe question is also whether there is a market for what you’re selling. Are people willing to pay $60 for essentially slightly nicer costume jewelry? Or is that market looking for fine jewelry? I know I wouldn’t spend $60 on shitty gold plated costume and would rather spend $250 on real gold.",

There is a medicine that can help. Do it as a side hustle first! Test, test, and test it some more. Prove it works, and prove you can do it. Then slowly change over to it. \n\nI've seen this a lot with family and friends. Smart, capable people save a bunch of money and quit their job to run their own business. They buy all the things and fill out and sign all the contracts and think that's the hardest part, that's the easiest part! Managing a business while it struggles will take you to the brink, and nobody is prepared for it. \n\nI have a friend who started her own consulting business. Her logo is perfect, she pays every bill early, she spent weeks reading about local and federal taxes to make sure she paid everything correctly, all while her product floundered and she lost money. She was doing the easy stuff to feel productive. The stuff that had a manual. At great cost and a steep learning curve she is starting to make money, but she still struggles a lot and in 5 years has made much less than her day job she quit.\n\nI have a family member who bought a local serciving business. I remember him calling me in tears. \"It's so hard, I have to do everything! I take calls, I set the appointments, I have to do the bookkeeping, I just want to do the work.\" He then blamed me for not volunteering to help enough, so I stopped answering my phone. He eventually sold the bisiness for less than half of what he paid and got his old job back. BTW I told him not to buy it in the first place but he was convinced it would save him and make him happy, it did the opposite.\n\nLastly, I have a super successful friend. Very talented and makes good money being an engineer. Every few years he and his wife get ideas of buying a business. Generally they come to me with an existing business costing $200k to $500k. It has been a restaurant, a cafe, a gym, and recently a sandwich shop. Each time I tell them the same thing, are you prepared to fail and lose all of the money and a year or 2 of your life? And have a miserable time during that time. I also tell them to test and find a business they can start with little to no investment of money. They then decide against it. \n\nThis is probably going to hurt, but almost everyone I know that \"made it\" with their business started in their teens and 20s. You have less to lose and you're more resilient when you're younger. People in their 30s/40s and older have so much more to lose and much less resilience. Think long and hard before quitting your job. Test the business first, and try to start with no or very little startup capital. Having capital upfront will not make you more successful or learn faster, from what I  have seen it does the opposite.",

So really I think it depends on the situation. \n\nThe advice I heard that I think is applicable here is to see if you as the business owner or boss are doing everything *YOU* should be doing to help the employee succeed. Essentially there are 4 things you should be doing. If you are doing all those things and the job is still not getting done, then it's time for them to go.\n\nThe four things you should be doing are ensuring they know what you want them to do, how to do the thing you want them to do, when that thing should be done by, and removing any obstacles that stop them from doing the thing.\n\n##1. What\nHaving a clearly defined role and set of responsibilities. If they don't know  what their role is and the responsibilities that come with it, they'll never be able to perform adequately. Clearly communicate the tasks they are responsible for completing.\n\n##2. How\nOnce they know their duties, confirm they know how to complete the job. For entry and mid level positions, SOPs are how you can give step-by-step instructions without having to constantly be present. For higher level positions that require more advanced or a larger variety of skills, and honestly most small business positions, training takes longer to get them familiar with how *your* business operates, or you're paying them enough to already come on with those skills already developed.\n\n##3. When\nIf they know what to do and how to do it, and it's still not getting done, then confirm they know the timeline. Tell them by when or how often they should be completing tasks. If you've told them once, remind them. You may not need to train them more, just a gentle reminder.\n\n##4. Obstacles\nIf they know what to do, how to do it, and when to have completed it, but it's still not getting done, check to see there isn't something external stopping them. The classic example is telling a chef you want a simple omelette for breakfast this morning and there being no eggs in your house/restaurant. Clearly despite the skills the chef has and the communication of your expectations, they won't be able to do it. Maybe the employee has an issue and they don't feel like they have the authority to \"fix\" the problem. Either fix it for them, go buy the eggs, or give them the authority and guidelines to fix it themselves.\n\nIf you as a business owner aren't making sure that your employees have everything they need to succeed, then you are failing your business in that respect.     \nSure, you may just have a bad hire, but that's also your fault for not vetting properly. Both management and hiring are skills you need to develop though, so it makes sense to suck at first.",

Then, you have to decide whether the gap is small enough that you're willing to invest in bridging it. You should account for vacancy costs, hiring costs, and risk of new employee failure in that case. It's pretty high in some fields and VERY high in others (e.g. sales).

Most companies have terrible training, terrible onboarding, and SMB owners especially have little ability or desire to document processes or let anyone learn or develop a better way. \n\nA lot of small businesses \"train\" new employees to react to whatever dumb shit the owner or early leaders tell them because they get scolded for doing anything on their own. That looks like micromanaging from the leader's perspective but it's a systems failure. \n\nHow long? Totally depends.

I also offer tiered services, I have \"standard\" cakes made from premix, which is what most bakeries use. I have \"premium\" which are made from scratch and have better quality/longevity.

          "body": "Edit: just jumping in to say I absolutely confused cash flow for revenue in the below original comment and  the numbers are off in that regard, but the below analysis should absolutely be considered for anyone buying a business. You will still need to factor in a huge hit of cash flow if financing any deal. That was my biggest shock when I bought my business.\n\n***\n\nOK I'm just going to approach this from a purely numbers perspective. Here's what I did.\n\nI bought a business with advertised revenue of 450k and Owner earnings of 150k. That 150k was split between a husband and wife that would both eventually exit.\n\nReality was the 450k was due to the pandemic, my normalized revenue first year was closer to 370k. I also gave all employees a 10% raise as soon as I took over, which pushed labor cost to be 50% of revenue due to the nature of this service business.\n\nMy projected yearly owner earnings were going to be 80k before purchase, but after purchase and Reality hit in the first 2 years it was closer to 40k per year. This is due to lower than expected revenue and insane interest on the SBA loan I took out. \n\nBefore you purchase, consider this:\n1) 1m for 350k cash flow is a steep price, especially for a franchise. 350k per year is 30k per month. Are you financing the deal? \n\n1m financed with 20% down can expect a payment of around 10.7k per month. So you're down to 19.3k per month.\n\nExpect franchise fees of 10% from top line revenue. So we're down to 16.3k per month.\n\nNow, how much is labor going to cost you? In an ideal perfect scenario, it's 30% of revenue, but expect 40% until you get things figured out. This is no leadership hires. We are down to 6.3k per month. \n\nSo with 6.3k per month are you able to afford all other expenses to run the business AND pay yourself to live, AND pay a GM to run it all?\n\nThe answer is most certainly no. Unless you're buying it with cash, which frees up 10.7k per month, but I have a feeling that's not the case.\n\nHope this helps.",

Good for budget printing.  \n\\- Mo⁤o - Better quality than VistaPrint but more expensive, around $30-40 for 250.

Bulk discounts are okay but nothing special.  \n\\- Mo⁤bilo - Digital option that's honestly cheaper long-term. One-time cost instead of reprinting every time. Lead tracking and analytics included. If you're tired of the printing loop, this makes sense.  \n\\- Ca⁤nva Print - Integrated with Canva if you design there. Pricing is middle-ground, around $25-30 for 250.

Moo is better quality but more expensive so skip them unless you're trying to impress.\n\nDigital cards are honestly underrated and I'd lean that way for most situations now. A simple link in your email signature or a QR code on your phone works for 90% of interactions. With our clients we've noticed physical cards mostly end up in a drawer or trash anyway while a LinkedIn connection actually leads somewhere.\n\nIf you do need physical cards for events or industries where they're expected, Canva has a print service that's cheap and lets you design without paying a designer. Or just order the absolute minimum quantity since your info will probably change within a year anyway.\n\nThe hundred dollar quote from local shops is insane unless they're doing letterpress or some fancy finish.

Doesn't matter what the gross revenue is, doesn't matter what the net revenue is either. Most people often miss the supply and demand of labor markets and just how integral the owner thinks you are. Nothing is stated about you other than your current position. Do you hold any licenses, certificates, degrees, that make you less replaceable? Do you believe, in the owner's perspective, you are indispensable not because of your chatbot bullets but with your responsiveness, proactivity, the relationships you build? Doesn't matter what you think do they view it that way? If you do not hold any specialized licenses or certifications, if you started looking elsewhere are there jobs available with what you are looking for? And more. The only thing that matters is they pay you minimum wage and treat you in line with labor laws.  The cost of living doesn't matter, the location doesn't matter, random numbers being thrown out without context is ridiculous.\n\nNow, let's assume you don't just do those tasks but you are indispensable. You do all of those tasks and do them better than most people with a similar resume as you. You hustle and have been a driver of the growth. You deal with employee relations and have some level of decision making power and do it all well. You are basically acting as a chief operating officer and an exceptional one. Without you it would crumble. Then the \"avg\" package doesn't apply. If you are integral and basically run the day to day, they should give you a package and treat you in a way you never want to leave, especially if you have other options. They need to realize without you, that work will fall all on them in addition to their business operating responsibilities, be spread out amongst the other employees likely burning them out, or  be completed by someone else, or the other employees, way below your abilities and quality.  They are fools to not have already been doing this if this is truly the case. There is a chance you view yourself as more important than they do or you are fairly replaceable but just going on what you said, they should be compensating you as much as feasible to keep you. That being said, all of those tasks, done in a mediocre manner just make you middle management in retail, easily replaceable. Reflect on your value and request a conversation. If you were my key employee I'd piss myself knowing your value and thinking you were even remotely feeling underpaid/undervalued or considering looking elsewhere. Good luck.",

For 19+ years, I watched all kinds of Entrepreneurs, startups both on and offline, small and mid-level businesses, and even my business go through what you're experiencing now.   \n  \nSo it's normal, almost an initiation of entering the business world. First, it's the setup of the dream, then reality starts to become apparent. You need to generate leads, drive traffic, engage, and move them to conversion and sales.\n\nThe more financially prepared you are, the less the stress. If you have the savings to pay for your bills while the business gains traction and builds, you are more likely to succeed than those who don't.\n\nSome operating on a shoestring can become successful. Some won't; the odds are against you, especially if you don't have real marketing and sales skills.\n\nThe real key is finding help that's seasoned and experienced in what you need next. Pricing is important, but don't judge capabilities based on how much they charge. I've seen a person who charges almost ridiculous low prices perform, and I've seen smooth-talking super expensive services fail.\n\nOver the years, you learn how to ask questions, and it's not always about the portfolio; it's about them explaining to you the what and how, and maybe even helping you first, so you learn to trust them.\n\nSo it sucks to be in the stage you're in now; it can go either way.

I’ve heard people swear by the big names, but other business owners I know are pushing to trial newer options, saying they’d be easier to use – just looking for a basic payroll software at the moment. I don’t have experience with evaluating payroll software personally, so not 100% sure what I should be looking for. I’m also seeing there's the whole professional employer organization route, which seems like overkill for us right now but is a nice option to have for the future. \n\nWhat are businesses actually using for payroll that doesn’t suck? We don't need anything super fancy, just a software that works and doesn't make me regret being a small business owner every single day. ",

I get way more pleasure from that than regular social media. \n\nI take a lunch break, read and take a short nap on days that I can. \n\nI break for dinner in the evening to spend time with my wife. \n\nInstead of working late into the night which is much less productive work time, i make lists for the next day(s). \n\nI keep a document open on my desktop for future plans and ideas to improve my company. \n\nInstead of scrolling when I go to bed I like to just lay there and think and let my mind wander.

What helped was realizing I could not rely on motivation anymore. As a solo founder, it is unreliable. I stopped asking how I feel and started asking what the company needs today. Small, concrete steps. I hired people who could build and focused on keeping the ship moving. Momentum creates motivation, not the other way around. You are not broken.

          "body": "I don’t rely on motivation at all. It’s too unreliable, especially when you’re on your own.\n\nAs a solo entrepreneur you have to replace motivation with structure. Fixed work hours, a short daily task list, and a clear definition of what a good day looks like. When the rules are set in advance, you don’t have to feel like working to do the work.\n\nI also separate thinking from doing. I decide what matters when I’m calm, then execute when I’m tired, bored, or doubtful. No re-deciding mid-day. That alone removes a lot of friction.\n\nAnother thing that helped was tying work to consequences. If I don’t do the work, money doesn’t come in. If money doesn’t come in, stress follows. I stopped trying to sugarcoat that reality and used it as fuel.\n\nLoneliness is real in solo work, so I build artificial accountability. Weekly targets, public commitments, or even just sending progress updates to someone I respect. You don’t need a team, you need a mirror.\n\nSome days still feel flat. That doesn’t mean you’re failing. Most real progress happens on days where nothing feels exciting. If you can keep working through those, you’re already ahead.\n\nMotivation is a bonus. Systems are what keep the lights on.",

I was working as a senior user experience designer and she said to me, is there anyway you can get all of this into one app and make it much cheaper. I gave it a try and boom, the birth of the solo-entrepreneur. I could do the User experience work, but then came learning to code, learning to make a backend, learning how to get on the app stores. How to sync data across ios and android. I have been working on this for almost two years now and it's almost done.

I can't tell you to not think about your responsibilities at all while you are away, but, rather than avoid work, gravitate towards living. Why did everyone who ever started a business do it? To live a better life! So do it! Or, regret it later. That is what I am trying to do personally.",
