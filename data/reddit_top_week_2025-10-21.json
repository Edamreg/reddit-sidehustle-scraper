From my very first email, I told them about the existing offers and made it clear that I wasn’t looking for lowball bids.\n\nThey still insisted on proceeding, so we went back and forth for about two weeks. After all that, their final offer came in at $25K. Totally made my day.\n\nThat’s all you need to know about this company, it's a scam.",

You are reviewing website designs before they launch. You give feedback on how easy or difficult their pages are to navigate before they release it! If you get up to 5 stars on feedback (very easy) you will be offered more tests. \n\n Pocket7Games- (Code for free money/tickets is sxqgquU) I got really good at a game on this app and genuinely made $200 from two games. It is fantastic just master a skill game. It is still “gambling” though since you’re playing against other people so don’t be dumb haha\n\nMeete- (Code for free money/coins is L9SHAZ) When you’re in a pinch you can get paid quite a lot either chatting with the men on here or telling other people to sign up to chat with users. I typically just share the affiliate link like I am now but I have also made a lot of money just chatting too. I DO NOT send anything NSFW but it seems like people who do tend to earn more.

It doesn’t matter if it’s a product or a service, start your side hustle from there.\n\nI understand that my financial starting point might have been different, but the idea stays the same.

So a few days later, I did my own research (im careful, but i think that's for the best) and more and more i realized how the whole thing worked. Because you hedge any bets you place, you are always making sure you have all of the outcomes covered so technically you can't lose and I know it sounds too good to be true but really it's just math. And then you use sportsbook promos to extract actual money. It's not a get rich quick thing but that's not what i was looking for, just wanted a small hustle i can pick up whenever i have time and not worry about it.",

      "selftext": "I’m an Automotive Technician with over two decades of experience.  I’ve always worked for a dealership, but recently formed my own business on the side.  I went through all the legalities of doing it the correct way; where I registered with the state and county that I’m in, got my EIN, and opened a business account.  Once it was all set up, I made a website, leased an office space and started advertising on social media.\n\nIt started out slowly— after the first 30 days I was questioning whether it was even worth it.  I barely made enough that month to cover business expense.  However, it began to snowball after I landed some mid-tier jobs and started to get 5 star reviews on Google.  Consistent advertising through instagram fueled the fire, while creating content on YouTube on the cars I was working on showcased my skills.\n\nFast forward today and after a short 7 months in operation, I’ve managed to build roughly $38k in business capital— all net profit.  The jobs I’m landing are also getting bigger.  I’m billing out dealership-level work orders and gaining repeat clients to boot.  Most recently; I performed a major engine overhaul on a clients car that was billed out at nearly $7k.  A week later he dropped his other car off with me to get it up to snuff on maintenance and any other repairs it needed.\n\nAs the work becomes consistent, I’m finding it difficult to juggle both the W2 and my own “side business”… which as of late I consider more of a full time business than anything— as all of the free time I have outside of the W2 is dedicated to building the business and scaling it up.  I know at some point, I’m going to have to choose between the two and I’m already strategizing how that will play out.  If things continue to accelerate at the pace that it has been, I see myself making the side hustle my main hustle and just picking up a part time job as a bartender or something… start networking and gaining clients that way.\n\nWhen I formed this business, I had my doubts on whether it would amount to anything.  Now I’m proud of what it has become and excited to see what it will eventually be.  \n\nBest advice I can give anyone that’s thinking of starting something on the side is this:  \n\n•Identify what you do best, and capitalize on that and that alone. (I’m a Mechanic… wouldn’t make sense for me to open a food truck).\n\n•Be prepared and put systems in place to keep you organized- keep your books tight.\n\n•Realize there will be monetary risks.  Start small, budget wisely, and don’t get over leveraged.\n\n•You will make mistakes- learn from them.\n\n•Don’t chase $, chase client satisfaction and those 5 star reviews.\n\n•The reward reflects the time and effort put in.\n\nHope this was interesting and that it inspires some people.  🔧 \n\n",

      "selftext": "Okay, after nine actual side hustles, I'm pretty sure my biggest accomplishment is proving I can come up with way more terrible ideas than good ones. Seriously.\n\nI’ve tried everything…. Etsy shops, blogs, print-on-demand, random AI projects, Pinterest loops, even indexing experiments that made my laptop sound like it was about to take off. Most of them died quietly. A few survived. And the stuff that stuck honestly had less to do with talent and more to do with timing.\n\nFirst lesson learned: quit the guessing game. My 'cool' ideas always crashed and burned. But when I simply started paying attention to the data, like trending keywords, those sudden search spikes, and what people were actually buying, things finally picked up. It's unsexy, sure, but it gets the job done.\n\nNext up, I realized loops are king. Forget doing one-off projects; it’s all about creating these little engines. Like Pinterest traffic sending folks to a blog, or old Medium articles funneling people to Etsy, or even just old listings getting evergreen sales thanks to reviews. The best ones were the ones that just kept going without me having to obsess over them.\n\nLesson three, ditch the 'originality' obsession. I seriously thought I needed to conjure up something nobody had ever seen. Nope. Turns out, just taking a winning concept, giving it your own spin, and getting it out there quickly is a far more profitable game.\n\nThe rest? It’s mostly noise. Fancy tools, new “growth hacks,” even ads, they helped sometimes, but not for long. What actually worked was keeping things small, repeating what clicked, and not getting bored when it got repetitive.\n\nOn paper, none of this sounds particularly impressive. But it's effective, and it just works, silently. And after diving into nine different hustles, I can tell you, 'quietly working' is now infinitely more appealing than the fleeting promise of 'maybe going viral.\n\nAnyone else find that the simple, boring stuff ends up working best?",

Export them neatly (transparent PNGs, SVGs, etc.) and either sell them on marketplaces or offer them free with ads and a paid tier for extra stuff.\n\nBonus tip: create your own website and sell without a commission.\n\nThere's a big audience of YouTubers, indie devs, and small creators who need quick visual assets but don't have the skill or time to draw. You could turn your skills or past drawings into a simple side hustle.",

You COULD put some time in it and make quite a bit more, but you don’t have to just to make a few bucks.  \n\nYou just log in at the end of the day and collect your steps with one button push.  If that’s all you do, it’ll take awhile, but you can still make money.  \n\nThings I do to speed up making money on it now are:\n\n-1 survey a night for like 5 minutes.  They are too boring for me to sit there and bang out, but you could do a bunch if you wanted.  \n\n-collect the “cards” Around town as you walk.  \n     -I do it if I’m riding passenger in a car.  Just open and and grab the daily seven cards as you pass them on the street lol.  \n\n-very occasionally play a game if it seems fun or they are running a bonus.  \n\n-referrals here and there when I can get them.  \n               -you get points and so does the person entering the code.  \n\n\nI have made 50-75 a month doing this for a bit now.  Not a killer income, but requires very little effort.  \n\nMy referral code is : \n\nPeacefulRhinoceros9144\n\nFull disclosure: I get 100 points and you get 150 points, or “wards” as they are called, once you reach 200 wards on your own.  You could do that the first day too if you did one or two surveys, or just collect your steps at the end of the day but it’ll take a little bit longer.\n\nOne of many apps I run to get low to no effort gift cards or Venmo.  Yes, they do pay out.  It takes like three days or so once you submit your cash out to get the gift card or Venmo.  \n\nHappy to answer any questions too.",

It is really simple you can start for $20 dollars buying designer colognes directly from the factory supplier and resell for $200+. I have being doing this for 3 months and i am already up to $1000 a week.\n\nYou just have to find good vendor/suppliers, I got mine from here [shadowresellz.com](http://shadowresellz.com) all great and high quality.",

With your skill set you could also offer freelance and consultant services if your skills are in demand. You can use TikTok and YouTube to advertise your services and if you get enough views you may even get a bit of ad revenue from TikTok and YouTube after a period of time although that would be long-term and slow rather than fast.\n\nDigital products might be a good idea but you need to come up with solutions for problems that no one has addressed yet and position yourself as a subject matter expert as digital products are very saturated.\n\nOf course check what other people are doing on Fiverr and similar websites and copy them while also undercutting them and later raise your prices after getting many sales and reviews.",

For the last 30 days I tried a simple rule: before 9am, do one small, slightly uncomfortable action (5–10 minutes) that measurably moves the side hustle forward. No bargaining, track a paper streak, keep it realistic.\n    \n    \n    Examples I actually did (reputable platforms only):\n    - eBay: photograph and draft one listing (even if I publish later)\n    - Upwork: improve my profile headline or tailor one proposal (no mass‑apply)\n    - Etsy: rewrite one listing description for clarity and keywords (no gimmicks)\n    - Uber Eats: check my schedule and set a 90‑minute block for later in the week\n    \n    \n    Why this helped me:\n    - It converts “I’ll do it tonight” into a concrete morning win\n    - 5–10 minutes is small enough to avoid excuses but big enough to create momentum\n    - The streak keeps me honest without over‑optimizing\n    \n    \n    Questions for this sub:\n    - What’s a compliant, 5–10 minute “first action” you’ve used on a reputable platform that clearly helps (not spam or mass outreach)?\n    - How do you prevent this from ballooning into a 45‑minute session that burns you out before work?\n    - On days you’re wiped, what minimum keeps the streak alive without pretending it’s progress?\n    \n    \n    Not asking for work or offering any — just looking for realistic, rule‑compliant ideas that have genuinely helped you move the needle.",

Advertise on local fb groups \n- set up an online shop using images they’ve taken where they can be printed on coasters, posters, calendars etc or sold at local events, maybe things like set of coasters/prints of the local area\n- advertise event photography where they’ll come to a family gathering and take pics for an hour or two\n\nHope these are helpful",

Like a brick wall or some such. \n\nFor extra money do some photoshop for either skin issues or transparent glasses. See YouTube on how to do that. \n\nI setup, 15 min, shoot 15 min, Lightroom maybe 30 min. I buy USB thumb drives in bulk from Aliexpress. Put exported Jpgs on it (3 different resolutions, low for Facebook, mid for computer background, 8x10 600dpi), parent can go anywhere for prints. \n\nGather stuff 15 min. I stay longer to ensure customer is happy and won’t charge more, to a limit. Depends on next customer that day. \n\n100$ - 200$ for such a service would be standard. Plus if kid is ready, all is done in 5 minutes. The other ten minutes (or more), get each parent also, whole family, etc. Bother and sister is very popular. Custom backgrounds are also very popular. \n\nI often just take random pics on vacation (beach), in parks and near landmarks with perfect noon-day sunny day just for this. I’m thinking of printing 8x10 or A4 format, 6 or 8 backgrounds, put in a catalog, have the parent select while taking pictures. \n\nSchool pics are easily 100$-300$ as you pay per printed kit. A cheap kit is like 100$. \n\nI shoot with Nikon D800 and lens for portrait mode.\n\nYa my setup is top notch but sometimes you can improvise, find used, and lower your portable studio startup costs.",

Also hired a graphic artist to do all the graphics for my page and the ones used in my videos.  Taught myself Davinci Resolve for video editing as well. After about a year with no success I kinda burnt out.\n\nI started posting a few videos again since last week and views and watch time have started to pick up again.\n\nI plan to release a video every week but does someone have advice on how to grow and promote my channel? In particular how to translate all those views and watch hours into subscribers?\n\nI've already done pretty much everything that is usually listed on Google posts on the topic.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Good at making transitions or effects? Sell those. Do you know how to color grade? Sell LUTs.\n\n\\- Make courses or PDF ebooks about specific things. Advanced tutorials and workflows, etc.\n\n\\- Create a YouTube channel and share tutorials. If you have specific knowledge it's possible to build a large audience quickly.\n\n\\- Once you build your audience, you can promote video editing software, Skillshare, and other creative products with affiliate programs to earn some additional income.\n\n\\- If you're looking for good sites where videographers sell digital products, I recommend FilterGrade, Motion Array, and Adobe Stock.",

      "selftext": "About a month ago I launched a silly little side project called [tuute.com](http://tuute.com) where people could log their farts just for fun and data visualization. It surprisingly took off: the world leaderboard now has over 3,000 farts logged from 100 countries. At first I just wanted to see if something that absurd could go viral, I now added a personal leaderboard recently so users could compete with themselves. Already six people have signed in with google and i'm so happy to say I have pushed my revenue from $1 to $2.46 (mostly through affiliate clicks). It’s not life-changing money, but it’s validation that even the weirdest ideas can earn something if you: Build fast and iterate based on feedback, Find joy in a micro-niche and don’t overthink “scalability” early on. Cheers. Tuute CEO ",

      "selftext": "I’ve been on Etsy for 2 years. When I launched my very first shop, I got just **1 sale in the first month**. After years of testing and learning the platform, my **6th shop** did **180 sales in its first month**. With the right strategy, sales grow month after month after launch.\n\nHere’s what it really takes to reach **3k a month:**\n\n1. **Daily posting.** Add new listings every day. Refresh old ones (photos/tags/descriptions) from time to time. The algorithm loves activity.\n2. **Product selection = competitor analysis.** I use eRank to study competitors’ bestsellers and only post products that already have proven demand -then I **remix** them into my own version (design, bundle, offer).\n3. **Discounts are strategy, not decoration.** But also, I’ve seen a shop with 40k sales that didn’t run “% off” but used a **bundle offer** like “Take 2 posters and get 50% off the pair.” It is also good strategy haha.\n4. **Don’t “sleep” after launch.** Many people open a shop and then post nothing for weeks. Etsy gives you a **Start boost -** if you miss that window, it’s harder later.\n5. **Bad start? Reset fast.** If your shop is cold for 1-3 months with no clear reason, **close it and reopen** with a sharper niche, storefront, and strategy. It’s faster than trying to revive a dead listing set. (I had this situation before)\n6. **Consistency or nothing.** My friend hit 1k in first month with 3 bestseller listings. When those cooled off, she stopped uploading. She doing one listing a week, and it isn’t enough. **Daily momentum = steady growth.**\n\n**A note on timing**\n\nThis month many sellers (me included) noticed odd shifts - sales dipped like Etsy tweaked something so much. If you’re about to start, consider waiting a couple of weeks for stability. Use that time to prep listings, bundle offers, and your daily posting plan.\n\nI have my own paid cheap on this topic, but I'm not linking it here to follow sub rules.\n\nLet me know what you think about :)",

          "body": "Ten years ago, I got interested in making other sources of income like affiliate marketing, party promotion, arbitration, and selling drugs. None of these worked for me because I was very introverted and didn’t have the knowledge to persuade people to buy what I was selling. By arbitration I thought it was drop shipping and that just seemed like a bad idea unless you have permission to sell people stuff. Affiliate Marketing seemed like you are just trying to make people join something that you don’t fully understand and once I understood what a pyramid scheme was that’s what I saw in every business plan. \nBasically by pyramid, there is someone on top and the lower “legs” or level, or hierarchy or whatever you want to call it. Different levels of management is called a pyramid so I still think it’s in everything like the government, corporations, businesses, etc. \n\nSo I found something that works for me!\n\nIf you feel like you need to get away from all of the business stuff, the pyramid scheme, the classes that cost too damn much and all the gurus that can’t help\n\nLISTEN UP!\n\nSo when I found this thing called making money from your phone ten years ago, I was curious!\n\nHow do you make money from your phones?\nIt was of course part of a bribe or a marketing scheme that will get you into an affiliate marketing campaign called Imarketslive. \n\nI’m not promoting their products or the business but I am promoting what they taught me. \n\nSo, as detailed as possible, currency was created after the barter system. When people saw the value of trading people’s resources they were then “enslaved” by materialistic things like gold, silver, bronze, wood, hay, bricks, rare metals and stones, upon other things.\n\nSo people found a standard system on which to trade which is the gold standard. Gold is traded to determine how much currency you have to purchase building materials, machinery, equipment, livestock, food, etc!\n\nGold along with money is transferred from the trading markets to the banks, held in vaults and only exchanged for big profits. \n\nA standard 24 karat gold bar is worth between $4,000 - $5,000 USD\n\nA 400 ounce gold bar is $1.3 million dollars or more!\n\nSo, instead of carrying around all of the gold from country to country, we made something that weighs less, can be easily replace, and is easier to transport.\n\nWhen technology advanced, we now can trade with the banks buying into money and trading with the banks as “retail traders” \n\nA retail trader is anyone that has the means to trade online but doesn’t have a corporate bank behind them to trade money. \n\nSo, now that you’ve reached the end I don’t want to borrow more time from you that I already have or you will have to message me to learn the system or process that I use to trade thousands of dollars on my phone or my computer without any work other than looking at fluctuating prices and lines that should be common sense.",

I have a lot of free time and tried everything I could online to turn minutes into dollars, this is the best thing I've found thats worth your time!\n\nWhen companies create / alter product lines.. they want to get a feel for how to general market will enjoy/dislike the product. Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

You need to find a good contact or agency or smth\n\nThe market is oversaturated for most kinds of existing jobs, in order to earn money doing simple work you should travel in time 15 years in the past\n\nTake time doing what youre doing, patience is important, getting a good amount of money in a short period of time (less than a month) is highly improbable\n\nThe last thing is advertise your stuff, be the most annoying you can be with it, share it everywhere\n\nI know all of this advice is well-known stuff already, but im trying to help anyone new who wants to start online, hope i did. I dont want to discourage.",

      "selftext": "I've been consumed by short form video for close to two years at this point. Like genuinely unhealthy consumed. Complete weekends just vanish into experimenting with approaches, analyzing what clicks, reworking identical content over and over.\n\nWhy pour in this much effort? Because short form runs the game now. Building audience, generating income, establishing reach, everything hinges on whether you can keep someone watching for 30 seconds.\n\nBut I was grinding constantly with nothing happening. Would invest hours into one piece only to watch it stall at 500 views. Attempted every strategy that performing accounts talk about. Purchased education. Still completely stuck.\n\nGenuinely started thinking maybe certain creators just have the gift and I clearly don't.\n\nThen I understood I'm working nonstop but can't identify what's failing. No clue what's broken. Just creating and hoping something randomly works.\n\nSo I abandoned the theories and started examining real performance data. Went through my last 52 videos frame by frame, mapped every single exit, and spotted 5 consistent patterns destroying my reach:\n\n**Your opening visual dominates everything.** Viewers decide to stay or scroll based purely on initial imagery before processing audio or text. I was starting with basic framing or gradual movements. Instant swipe. Now I lead with my most compelling visual even when it disrupts sequence. Visual impact immediately, context follows.\n\n**The 5-7 second mark decides commitment.** Everyone fixates on the start but viewers truly engage around 5-7 seconds after assessing actual value. I was building anticipation when I needed immediate delivery. Placing my strongest element at second 6 transformed retention completely.\n\n**Smooth transitions provide exit windows.** I assumed polished transitions appeared quality. They simply create natural leaving moments. Now I default to direct cuts almost entirely. Feels jarring during production but maintains attention during consumption.\n\n**Hard-to-read text outperforms clear text.** Paradoxical but large simple text viewers absorb passively gets dismissed. Compact rapid text requiring focus keeps them engaged because they're actively capturing information. Interaction metrics jumped substantially.\n\n**Content below 14 seconds gets restricted distribution.** I was creating everything at 8-10 seconds assuming shorter performed better. But platforms need sufficient viewing duration to properly evaluate content. Extending to 15-20 seconds increased my distribution because aggregate watch time rose despite reduced completion percentages.\n\nThe fundamental change wasn't discovering these patterns. It was getting actual visibility into what specifically wasn't working instead of operating blind.\n\nFound a tool that analyzes content and identifies exactly what's broken and how to address it. That's when performance actually shifted. Moved from stuck at 500 to consistently hitting 100k within roughly six weeks. Basic analytics just tells you when the exits happened. This identifies the precise moment, underlying reason, and exact modification needed.\n\nIf you're producing regularly but restricted under 3k it's not content inadequacy, it's insufficient visibility into actual performance versus perceived performance.\n\nPutting this out because solving this was legitimately one of my toughest challenges. Genuinely wish someone had explained this framework earlier. Would've avoided months of spinning without direction. Doing that now for anyone needing it.\n\n**EDIT:** Getting questions about the tool - [TikAlyzer](http://tikalyzer.com) (also compatible with Reels/Shorts)",

      "selftext": "I feel like most people on this page don't actually understand what passive income is. By no means am I a pro, but here is what I do. \n\nI live in the Dominican Republic, and have started with a few investments. I have a motorcycle that I bought for $400 and a Tri-moto (basically a three wheeler but has a truck bed in the back of the motocycle.) Which are commonly used to haul building materials, trash, or help people move as well as many other things. The Tri-moto was $3000. Every day, except for Sunday the motorcycle brings in $4 and the Tri-moto brings in  $12. Weekly that is an income of $96, minus the $18 I pay to someone to manage this. So every month I'm making $312 for doing absolutely nothing. \n\nI know it's not much. But it feels great to be getting these systems started. It's about 10% of what I need to live my life, so a good start. The plan now is to save 100% of this until I can get another tri-moto. \n\nFeel like I need to say this because everyone here is always selling a course. Well, I don't have one. Just common sense. Find something someone needs for a job, and rent it to them. Everyone wins. ",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nQuick PSA for anyone using Stripe for their side projects. My passive income project had its \"best day ever\" with a $400 sale, which turned out to be a fraud attack.\n\nI almost got hit with hundreds in chargeback fees ($15 per transaction!) on top of the lost sale.\n\nThe scary part? This happened because Stripe's most important fraud-prevention settings are OFF by default.\n\nHere's the 3-minute fix to protect yourself:\n\n* Go to your Stripe Dashboard → Radar → Rules.\n* Find and ENABLE the rules to BLOCK payments if:\n   1. CVC verification fails\n   2. Postal code verification fails\n* For ultimate protection, enable 3D Secure (3DS) in your payment settings. This shifts fraud liability from you to the bank, so you're covered.\n\nI caught it in time, but it was a massive wake-up call. Don't learn this lesson the expensive way.\n\nI wrote a full post-mortem on what happened, the exact fraud pattern to look for, and a step-by-step guide with screenshots on my blog.\n\nFull Story &amp; Guide: [https://choy.in/blog/stripe-is-dangerous](https://choy.in/blog/stripe-is-dangerous)\n\nHope this helps someone avoid a disaster!",

Did you start a side hustle that paid you $50 for your first gig, even if it was crap?\n\nI'm not looking for a \"get rich quick\" scheme. I just wanna know what that first, tangible, no-bullshit action was that finally got the ball rolling for you.\n\nAnd while we're at it, what do you all do for a living now?

          "body": "I’ve got several pieces of advice for you…\n\n1. Stop reading the get rich quick content. It’s a waste of your valuable time. It doesn’t exist. Overnight successes were generally years in the making. There’s no magic money tree that just makes you wealthy without effort. If you want a magic money tree, you have to find some soil, plant a seed, water it, give it the right nutrients, protect it from storms and the cold and the heat, prune it, and give it time to grow and blossom. Does that sound passive? It’s not.\n\n2. You have to just pick something and start. The thing you pick should be something that you’re interested in and have an aptitude for. Instead of consuming everything you can about get rich quick ideas, consume everything you can about the thing you picked. Become an expert.\n\n3. Find a way to start inexpensively. Businesses are generally set up as fixed cost or variable cost. A fixed cost business has expenses every month regardless of what your revenue is. Rent, employee salaries, insurance, etc. A variable cost business generally has costs associated with revenue. If you’re a reseller…you get orders for a product, collect payment, and then get the product and ship it. Without the order, you had none of those costs. When you are just starting out, try to donut the variable cost way so that you can test the concept without going broke.\n\n3. It won’t be passive. So find the right Sub to join to talk about working for yourself. Sidehustles or entrepreneur is more appropriate.\n\n4. Starting a business is almost like having a kid. It requires a lot of time, and effort. It’s not easy, but it can be very rewarding at the same time. But you are committing a significant portion of your time (now and in the future) which comes with sacrifices. \n\n5. Get excited! Because passive income IS possible. It just requires time/effort to build.\n\nGood luck!",

          "body": "Been there. Most people get stuck in that “learning phase” loop because it feels productive, but it’s actually just safe. The first real progress happens when you stop researching and start testing small.\n\nHere’s what usually breaks that loop:\n\nPick one lane and ignore everything else for 30 days. It doesn’t matter if it’s design, automation, or marketing. You’ll only figure out what fits once you start doing.\n\nBuild one tiny thing that could help someone. A simple template, a landing page, a workflow, anything. It doesn’t need to be perfect, just real.\n\nGet feedback right away. Post it, share it, or show one person who might care. That feedback is where all real learning happens.\n\nKeep repeating until something sticks. That’s how actual skills form — not from theory, but from small things that slowly start to work.\n\nEveryone wants the perfect plan, but plans don’t help until you move. Pick one idea, build something small, and let the next step show up after that.",

          "body": "The \"first, tangible, no-bullshit action\" is to stop thinking like a poor, broke person and start thinking like a successful person. Most poor people get stuck in the same cycle of \"Need money, must get job\", so they apply for jobs where other people tell them what to do. Nothing wrong with that if you are satisfied living paycheck to paycheck your whole life.\n\nSuccessful people, on the other hand, see opportunities all  around them. Making money is easy for them, as even the failures are a lesson to learn from, because they don't NEED the money, so they can take on more risks to earn more than a poor person could afford to do. We've all read the stories of rich people losing millions overnight due to stocks dropping or crypto, and they shrug it off and move on.\n\nI was that poor person many years ago, working a shitty, dead end job, but I observed how rich people acted. They took risks and didn't give a shit. Once I changed my mindset from poor person to rich person, even when not rich yet at the time, it was a lightbulb in my head.\n\nNow I actually enjoy thinking up income streams and I earn enough that I'm not afraid to take risks. Making money is EASY, but changing your mindset to get there is the hardest part. Nail that and you WILL be successful.",

Just focus on creating something useful and getting that first listing live.\n\nOr try print on demand. Sites like Printful let you upload designs and sell them on things like shirts and mugs. You can connect that to Etsy, so you don’t need to run ads or build a store from scratch.\n\nAffiliate marketing is a great path too, but you need to learn how to make content that actually persuades people to buy. That’s where most people fail. I explain exactly how to do that in my newsletter.\n\nYouTube is another legit option, even faceless. It won’t make you rich overnight but once it gains traction, the passive income potential is real through ads, affiliate links, and sponsorships.\n\nIf you want to sell physical products, try dropshipping through eBay. eBay already has traffic, so you don’t need to waste money on ads. Just learn the basics, pick a product, and get it listed.\n\nFor long-term financial growth, start investing in index funds. It won’t solve the present, but it builds the future.\n\nMost people who finally started earning didn’t find the perfect idea, they just took imperfect action.

I have a lot of free time and tried everything I could online to turn minutes into dollars, this is the best thing I've found thats worth your time!\n\nWhen companies create / alter product lines.. they want to get a feel for how to general market will enjoy/dislike the product. Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m 30 years old and currently living in Georgia. I’ve been seriously thinking about relocating to Europe possibly Barcelona or Porto and living a more carefree lifestyle. Before making the move, I want to understand realistically how much passive income would be “enough” to live comfortably without stressing about monthly bills.\n\nHere’s my current financial situation in detail:\n\n*  **Passive income:** $600 + $300 + $200 = **$1,100/month** from three fully paid-off apartments I rent out.\n* **Mortgage:** $2,000/month total for two other apartments.\n   * One of them still has **$80,000** remaining (out of $113,000). I’ve already paid $33,000 on it.\n   * The other is still being built — still has **$53,000**  (remaining out of $89,000). I’ve already invested **$36,000**. If I decide to sell this unit, I can get that $36,000 back immediately.\n* **Deposit:** $25,000 personal Deposit.\n* **Total remaining real estate debt:** $80,000 + $53,000.\n* **Income:** Including salary and passive income, I make around **$10,000/month**.\n* If I move, I plan to rent out the apartment I currently live in for an extra **$500–600/month** at least (That's the one is **$80,000** mortgage).\n\nI want to know:\n\n1. How much **passive income** would you personally consider “enough” to live a stress-free life in Europe (mainly Barcelona or Porto)?\n2. Would it make sense to **sell the under-construction apartment** and use that money toward covering my $80K mortgage and use $25K deposit also before moving?\n3. Or should I wait a bit longer, build more cushion, and then make the move? If so, till when is reasonable to wait. I'm not young, either old, I know, however time flies and that fears me.\n\nMy goal isn’t to live luxuriously — just comfortably, without financial anxiety. Any advice, especially from those who’ve relocated to Europe or live on passive income, would be super appreciated",

She was smart about finances, and knew how to suck money out of men. (Don't ask me how I know.)\n\nYour freedom number is how much income per month you need to be free - or do what you're trying to do - retire in Europe... or at least, go on a long-term sabbatical in Europe.\n\nHer number was $4,000.00 - she was able to live a reasonably modest life in Europe. She traveled to an inexpensive location in Italy - near San Remo. It used to be a popular resort area before air travel became cheap... say, prior to WWII. \n\nFrom there, you can have lunch in France and work on your Italian and French. It is very close to the French Riviera (easy drive to Nice, Cannes and Monaco, Monte Carlo...)\n\nShe was able to rent a cheap apartment - decent and not too fancy and live life.   \n  \nBut also to take into consideration what she doesn't tell people... she is VERY good looking and so probably got invited out a lot by men. She didn't tell me this, but you would have to assume this. \n\nSo it will depend upon your lifestyle. If you cook at home and buy groceries in local markets it will be very cheap. If you fancy sitting in a sidewalk cafe sipping esspressos in the morning and wine in the evening, it will add up to more.\n\nIf you eat in restaurants or plan on dating and are male... much more.",

Safety issues, leftist government, a ton of taxes spent on shit, high unemployment rate, etc. \n\nHowever, if you still want to live there (or Portugal, which is much nicer), \"enough\" depends entirely on what that concept means to you. 10k a month is a shitload of money that only 1% of the population in Spain earns, but that includes your salary. \n\nIf we're talking only about passive income, you can live a comfortable life with 2k a month. And yes, I said 2k a month even if most digital nomads will tell you they need 5k a month. Again, Spaniard here and I've lived in 4 countries. But this will vary based on your lifestyle. \n\nDo you plan on buying or renting in the new country? If you plan on renting, you can find apartments for 1 person in Barcelona for 1k and you would have 1k more for food, transportation, and going out. That's plenty enough. \n\nOn the other hand, if you're one of those who wants to eat out every single day, live in the most expensive areas in a penthouse on the 30th floor, buy expensive clothes, drive a fancy car, waste money on random women, you're a heavy smoker/drinker, etc. 2k won't be enough. \n\n\"Enough\" is a very broad and subjective term. I lived in the city center of Barcelona (Eixample neighborhood) for 1350 euros all-included. I'm talking rent, food, 1 motorbike, and going out with my friends. But going out meant normal restaurants, cinema or art exhibition. Didn't go to clubs, didn't waste money inviting random women at fancy restaurants, didn't buy designer clothes every month, etc. Also I don't drink alcohol, non-smoker, no money spent on drugs. It was enough for me :)",

I completed the qualification and received an email on October 8th about completing an identity verification process in order to stay on Project Sonic and receive pay.\n\nPoint is, I completed the qualification task and identity verification shortly after receiving said email.\n\nI never got an email confirming that I could start working on Project Sonic (it was mentioned in the qualification email that I would get a follow-up email indicating whether I passed or not).

Does this mean I could start working now?

Using Claude AI to help me build, and documenting the journey here.\n\n**The Niche:** Plant-based milk alternatives (oat, almond, soy, coconut, cashew)\n\n**The Hook:** Interactive quiz that matches people with their perfect plant milk based on use case, taste, values, and dietary restrictions. Results page has Amazon affiliate links.\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n*Day 1-2 (Oct 9-10):*\n\n* Built quiz on bus commute using Claude AI\n* Launched on [noncow.com](http://noncow.com) (domain I already owned)\n* Set up Google Analytics, Search Console, Amazon Associates\n* Added Schema markup\n\n*Day 3-4 (Oct 11-12):*\n\n* Posted to r/vegan (8.3k views, 58 comments)\n* Posted to r/dairyfree (1.9k views)\n* First sale! $1.69 (someone bought a kids' winter jacket after clicking my oat milk link 😂)\n\n*Day 5-6 (Oct 13-15):*\n\n* Got roasted in comments for UX issues - people couldn't get accurate results\n* Completely rebuilt quiz algorithm based on feedback\n* Added blog structure with first SEO article: \"Best Plant Milk for Keto Diet\"\n* Separated quiz from homepage for better funnel\n\n**Current Stats (Day 6):**\n\n* 240+ total users\n* 36 active users this week (steady \\~9/day post-Reddit spike)\n* 30 Amazon clicks total\n* $1.69 earned (1 sale shipped, waiting on more)\n* 4.76% conversion rate (30 clicks → 1 sale)\n* 306 events this week (8.5 actions per user - good engagement)\n\n**Traffic Sources:**\n\n* Reddit posts (main driver)\n* Direct/word of mouth\n* Waiting on Google to index blog content\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n\n* Plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)\n* GitHub Pages (free hosting)\n* Amazon Associates (only monetization)\n* Claude AI for code help\n\n**What's Working:**\n\n* Interactive quiz format gets people engaged\n* Reddit responds well to \"I built this\" posts\n* Quiz-to-affiliate-link funnel converts at \\~5%\n* User feedback loop helps iterate fast\n* Traffic sustaining after initial Reddit spike\n\n**What's Not Working Yet:**\n\n* No organic search traffic yet (too new)\n* Reddit traffic is spiky, not sustainable long-term\n* Need more content for SEO\n* Low returning visitor rate (everyone's new)\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n* Write 2-3 more blog posts targeting search keywords\n* Submit sitemap, wait for Google indexing\n* Maybe add email capture for newsletter later\n* Consider Reddit strategy for consistent traffic\n\n**Investment:**\n\n* Time: \\~12 hours total (evenings + commutes)\n* Money: Claude Pro $250/year, domain $12/year\n* Total: $262\n\n**Questions for this community:**\n\n1. Should I focus on more blog content or drive more Reddit traffic?\n2. How long until Google starts sending organic traffic typically?\n3. Anyone else using AI tools to build faster?\n4. Tips for converting one-time visitors to returning users?\n\nHappy to answer questions about the process or share what I've learned!\n\nSite: [noncow.com](http://noncow.com) (mods feel free to remove link if not allowed)",

It's weirdly quiet.\n\nThe worst part? You can't really talk about it. Friends ask \"how's the app going?\" and you either lie (\"great!\") or dump too much on them and watch their eyes glaze over. I've been staying sane by engaging on Reddit honestly. At least here people get what it's like to build something nobody asks for yet.\n\nWhat pulls you out of those 2AM spirals?

The accountability keeps me showing up.\n\n2) Finding one other person doing the same thing - not a mentor, just someone else in the grind. Even a 10-min \"how's it going\" call breaks the isolation.\n\n3) Reframing the silence as data - if no one's seeing my stuff, that's not failure, that's a distribution problem to solve.\n\n4) Celebrating tiny wins - \"I posted today\" counts. \"I DMed 3 people\" counts. Not just \"I made $10k.\"\n\nThe grind is lonely because most people quit before they get to the other side. The ones who make it aren't more talented - they just found ways to not quit during the 2AM spiral.\n\nWhat's kept you going so far?",

With hindsight, I'd probably try to introduce premiums for specific bad behaviour (e.g. last minute request fee) and stick to them religiously. Then if the customer leaves, they leave. If they stay they'll be incentivised to behave better, and who knows, maybe they will (if not you can keep increasing those premiums).

It has been very rare that we have come across a client that finds this unreasonable. No one gives full access. It is not wise to make emotional decisions or to go at a client with blame.

After a short while, you accommodate the extra cash and the stress is still there.\n\nIf you have some month savings to fall back on, fire them in a polite way (using words like focusing on different niche etc always sounds nice), and give a 2 month notice. (Which will be horrible- admittedly.)\nDuring that time focus on the basics with them and say that you want to give them the tools to make it easier for whoever they get to take over - within that 2 months).\n\nWhile this is happening- market your ass off to try get 3-4 smaller paying clients to help build the shortfall. Use the current client as reference (with their ok) or just mention it in passing in person if not. \n\nAfter this period of grind, the aim would be to have at least 3 smaller clients to make up a good bunch of what you are losing from the big one.  Going forward then try devote half a day each week if possible to marketing so you end up with no one client being more than 15% of your income.

I thought quitting the 9to5 would automatically make life lighter. Spoiler: it didn’t. Now the pressure just comes from a different direction. Every decision, every mistake, every slow week it’s all on me. There’s no safety net, no one to pick up the slack when I burn out. Some days I’ll be crushing it and the next I’m staring at invoices wondering what the hell I’m doing with my life. I’ve started building in little resets to stop my brain from frying quick walks, playing myprize while waiting for emails. It sounds dumb but ten minutes of doing anything unrelated helps me come back to work with an actual functioning brain. Curious how you all handle it. How do you keep the pressure from turning into constant anxiety when you’re the one in charge of everything?",

          "body": "Entrepreneurship is not 9-5 and the highs and lows are part of the game. The sooner you make peace with that, the better you will feel. My strategies:  \n1. I keep reminding myself why I am building my start-up. At this point, getting a 'good exit' is not even at the top of the list (although that would be nice!). I have started this to solve a problem and need to see it through.\n\n2.  See if you can build a 'support system' - I have a buddy who is also going through a similar journey and we have agreed to keep talking to each other about our pain points. \n\n3. Listen to your body - at least as a solopreneur, I have some degree of freedom with my schedule. I usually listen to  energetic music when i work or go workout, shower, etc. when I need a break. Sometimes I even take a nap in the middle of the day and then slog it out late in the night. The key is to understand what keeps you in your productive zone most of the time and try to do more of that. High Productivity/Passion =&gt; Less Stress.\n\n4. Have something that you can look forward to. For me, I keep (kept? - more below) my Friday evenings to just unwind with my favorite food and drink. I'm back at it first thing Saturday morning, but Friday evening is my time. Through out the week, I imagine myself sitting on the couch on Friday evening and ask myself 'what do I need to accomplish before Friday, that will help me enjoy it more?' and the work towards that.\n\n5. Go Public! Recently, I went public with my startup on LinkedIn (nerve wracking, yes), but that is driving a new level of accountability that I don't even want to do my Friday ritual anymore (LOL). It is not just the fear of public failure, but also the motivation from listening to people's problems and how I am working to solve those.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nPS: Yes, I have read Tim Ferris' \"4-Hour Work Week\", but haven't truly figured out how to make it work for my situation.",

I just wanted to share my thoughts. Later, it turned into a tool for building my reputation, and now I’m not even sure: am I running LinkedIn, or is LinkedIn running me? :)\n\nToday, I’ve gathered some numbers, results, and fun facts, and answered some of my followers’ questions.\n\nDo recruiters and HR people reach out? No, not really. And that was my plan. Here’s why: I’m not job-hunting and don’t position myself as a candidate. I’m building the reputation of a strong marketer and an engaging storyteller. I think that protects me from offers I’m overqualified for or simply uninterested in. That said, I have received several great inquiries, ones definitely worth attention, for senior roles, mid-level positions, and personal brand management.\n\nI just write about what interests me. My topics depend on that. If my interests change, maybe my “strategy” will too. Probably more about work, since now I have one.\n\nDid I find a job? I did. I’m not sure LinkedIn directly helped, but thanks to it, I’ve had side gigs that have totaled about $1,000. That wasn’t my goal, though.\n\nI didn’t expect such rapid growth or to reach such high numbers. So far, I’m satisfied :)\n\nI’ve garnered 3.6 million impressions, gained over 7,000 followers, and written 270 posts, averaging 128 reactions and 30 comments.\n\nOverall impression, I like it. I’m grateful to the people who read me. It makes me happy, and I encourage everyone who enjoys writing to just keep doing it, even if your reach isn’t impressive yet.",

      "selftext": "\nWhen I first started buying companies, I didn’t have investors, fancy financing, or any kind of silver spoon. What I did have was time, curiosity, and a willingness to talk to business owners who wanted to retire. Over time I figured out that most people selling good companies don’t care about finding the highest bidder. They care about finding someone who will take care of what they built. That shift in thinking is what made everything possible.\n\nHere’s what I’ve learned from actually buying businesses with limited capital in 2025.\n\nI look for companies that are simple and steady. No hype. No startups(unless we think we can make something work with the existing owner staying on full time). I like plumbing, concrete, restoration, logistics, small manufacturing, marketing agencies with retainers, and local service companies that people rely on every week. They’re not glamorous, but they make consistent money and they’ve usually been run by the same person for twenty or thirty years. Those owners are tired. They want to slow down, but they also want to know their employees and customers will be taken care of.\n\nI build my own list. I pick an industry, use Google Maps, and write down every company that looks active. Then I just reach out. I’ll call or email the owner and say something like, “Hey, I’ve followed your business for a while and really respect what you’ve built. I own and operate a couple small companies and was wondering if you’ve ever thought about stepping back or bringing someone on to help with the next stage.” That’s it. No big sales pitch. Just a human conversation.\n\nMost people say no the first time and second time. Some never call back. But a few will talk. And those few conversations are where all the good deals come from. I keep track of everyone I contact and follow up every few months. Timing is everything.\n\nOnce a conversation turns serious, structure matters more than anything. I’ve used seller financing in nearly every deal I’ve done. One deal went like this: $1 million purchase price, $100k down, $500k SBA loan, and the seller carried $400k at five percent interest for five years. They liked the idea of getting paid over time instead of walking away. It gave me enough breathing room to run the business right.\n\nIf I don’t have the down payment, I find a partner who’s comfortable lending it in exchange for interest or a small profit share. I keep control by structuring it as a loan, not equity. That kind of creativity gets deals done without losing ownership. That said I always want an active partner. No passive guys - not worth the headache. \n\nI always talk to banks before I need them. I’ll call local SBA lenders and ask what they like to see from borrowers. They’ll tell you exactly how they think. That’s free education. When you finally bring them a real opportunity, you already know how to package it so they can say yes. Also keep in mind some of the local banks aren’t really SBA. \n\nDue diligence is where most buyers get lazy. I don’t. I ask for tax returns, bank statements, vendor lists, customer breakdowns, and payroll reports. I compare deposits to income. I verify that employees are real and staying on. I want no surprises after closing.\n\nWhen I negotiate, I care more about structure than price. I’ll ask for a few months of interest-only payments or a transition period where the seller helps part-time. Those little details protect cash flow while you learn. Sellers usually say yes because it helps everyone succeed.\n\nIf you want to get started, here’s what I’d do right now.\n\nWeek 1: pick one or two industries you understand. Build a list of 25 businesses in your area.\nWeek 2: call or email 10 owners. Get two real conversations.\nWeek 3: ask one of them for basic financials. Build a rough deal model just to practice.\nWeek 4: talk to one SBA lender and ask what it would take to fund a deal like that.\n\nThen repeat the cycle every month. If you stay consistent for 90 days, you’ll have real leads, real numbers, and one or two sellers who are thinking about it.\n\nBuying a business with limited capital isn’t magic. It’s process, patience, and communication. The 2025 market is full of retiring owners who want someone capable to take over. If you can listen, plan, and follow through, you can become that person.\n\nIf anyone wants to talk through how to start, how to reach out to sellers, or what to look for in a deal, drop your questions. I’m happy to share what’s worked for me.\n\nDr Connor Robertson",

The kind of agency you barely even manage because stuff just gets done.\n\nThen last week on a random call he drops something wild. He says he wants to be straight with us. Turns out the original case study he sent in his pitch wasn’t real. The results, screenshots, even the dashboard video were made using a mock tool that copies real platform dashboards.\n\nHe said no one gave him a shot without proof so he faked it to get in the door. Then actually learned the skills for real after landing us. And honestly, he’s been better than most of the so-called verified experts we’ve paid before.\n\nHe showed us the site and honestly we couldn’t even tell the difference between the fake dashboard and a real one. Which is a bit scary if you think about it.\n\nIt’s weird realizing the thing that made us hire him was fake, but the outcome actually justified it. Would you trust someone after a confession like that?",

I’d also request to know immediately what else is faked because you cannot afford the ramifications from any other fake work unless you know about it and can start containing or mitigating the impact. Depending on what you find, there could be a risk of customer loss or worse litigation.\n\nOnce that is out of the way, you should decide if you want to let them work towards rebuilding trust. IMO it must NOT be a simple just trust them but rather they’d need to agree to not represent artificial data as real and work under additional scrutiny into their output which you can slowly reduce as trust is rebuilt. This is not just for the benefit of knowing if they are trustworthy but also to really drive home the point on how sacred trust is.",

I have to push back on it initially, but it almost always comes back with fantastic analysis. \n\n2.

Personally I am huge fan of Windsurf Cascade agent that as been able to pull off large changes to our production app from a single prompt! But some prefer Cursor!\n3. Frizerly: Their AI agent can learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website helping us improve our Google ranking. Saves me and my team 10+ hours every week!  \n4. Google Nano Banana: This is a new addition but it is crazy how it can make edits to images by keeping certain things same accurate. For example, it can turn a simple product image into full blown professional photoshoot with models etc. It can change color of your products etc. Must have for marketing imo! \n5.

It's not great complex apps for SAAS etc but it's great for marketing landing pages, and simple stuff! \n6. Intercom Fin: We had an issue where whatever we do and document on our website, people kept asking some obvious questions on chat taking up valuable support bandwidth. Now Fin can auto resolve these questions instantly. Other questions get auto routed to real people so that people are not mad as well! !\n\nAnd that's about it I guess!",

If anything says it will solve all of your problems or grow your business in days, don't waste your time on it.  \n2) Try the commercially available LLM's like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc. These can offer significant improvements in personal productivity for yourself and your staff. Two caveats: 1) Treat their output as draft, not final. 2) Realize that everyone else is using this same information.  \n3) Talk to someone who can help you develop customized automations (AI or no AI) for your business, workflows, and processes that use your proprietary data. This is where the real business value is found.\n\nAnd yes, we've done all 3.",

A rich couple walking their dog walked up to the while he and I were working on something and asked what we did at the building. My father asked rudely, \"What do you want?\" \n\nThey got the message and walked away. My father was an alcoholic and could be an asshole. I remember feeling embarrassed for his behavior that day. Later in life, I understood better why he ran them off. \n\nHe was a chemical engineer and a lawyer that was too belligerent to be employed by anyone so he was a contractor all his life. His main passion in life was fishing, hunting, and going to the bar to meet his friends, all while drinking of course. \n\nWhat I later figured out is if he gets friendly with the rich couple then maybe they want to borrow tools, ask engineering or legal questions, or inquire about his occupancy permit which he did not have. There's a whole host of possibilities and he already had all the friends that he wanted. The couple had nothing to offer that interested him and was a potential pain in the ass. \n\nHis boundaries and communication skills were atrocious but walking up to non-public warehouse with no sign and asking questions is a good way to be told to tuck off. \n\nI'm far more polite than my father but I've learngymed not to get too friendly, too fast with anyone. Unfortunately, friendly people often end up being a problem and they were being nice to get something or have some type of drama. \n\nNow, I'm the cynical old man and if7 I'm approached in public, the first thing out my mouth is, \"What do you want?\" The next thing is, \"I'm not interested.\" If they still want to talk to me, \"Is this an emergency? Should I call 911?\" It's always no so, \"If it's not an emergency then I don't have time.\" It's the same script every time. \n\nI've learned to keep it short and sweet with my neighbors as well. They have stepped over the line enough that I don't want the hassle. Some of the people with the most integrity and decency that I have met in life were not initially that friendly.

I even tried to start two businesses with my friends, but both failed (the first, my friend and I stopped liking the project, and the second one, I was the only one putting in the time, and then I had a burnout) before even having an MVP. I know it's my fault, but I am just saying.\n\nI have around 3 years of software engineering experience and 1 year in sales, since I do it as a side-hustle.\n\nNow I want to go in and build something, but after my burnout, I feel like I am having some trouble having ideas and starting again. And I am afraid of never leaving this wantrepreneur stage.\n\nI don't care about being rich, I just want to build something that helps make people's lives better and be able to maintain the flexibility I have from working remotely.\n\nCan you guys give me some tips on how to leave this stage?",

I set small goals, the next feature, the next little thing I wanted to add, and focused on building just that. Celebrate the little wins, and listen to your body. It is very important to do that.\n\nIf you feel super anxious about starting work for no clear reason, or you are struggling to concentrate, that is the time to step back. Take a break, do something else, and come back in a day or two when your mind has reset. Then push forward again, keeping that balance. Do not overdo it.\n\nMy current startup took me three years to get to where I am, and I am very proud of what I have built. So just pick something, scope out the basics, build the bits, and you will learn along the way. There is no such thing as failure, there is only learning. And at the end of the day, you might have built a really good product that may or may not make money. Hopefully it does, but even if it does not, you have still learned a huge amount, and maybe you have got some great code you can reuse for something else",

I am at 9 months about to launch within the next 4 weeks (will not promote, just shedding light on reality). Took so much perseverance, dedication, and patience. Clocked over 8-9 hours a day on average coding everyday. It's not an AI wrapper but still, I feel like so many people underestimate how long a real project takes. For those in the same shoes, don't give up! These stories used to downplay my progress but the reality is this: it takes a long time for something great and useful. Keep grinding and create amazing things! AI has been a huge help but no way in hell could you vibe code or start a big project to launch ready in such short time.\n\nEdit: I do have 3.5 years of experience in creating full stack applications. I have built apps that still currently have many hundreds of daily active users. I have validated my current idea directly through people and groups and have listened to competitor's negative reviews and feedback. These things are risks but I have calculated that this is worth the risk! Thank you for your support and concerns !",

You’re doing it right: validating, listening, building something that lasts. AI helps, sure, but it doesn’t replace the grind or the learning curve. Respect for keeping it real and pushing through.\n\n(Also lowkey, if you ever need to offload some of the non-dev stuff like outreach, admin, or testing tasks, outsourcing bits of the workflow can actually save your sanity.

I'm asking because I'm learning this as I go. In my roadmap, launching will take me around other 3 or 4 weeks. So, it's not just a one-click action.  \nMy understanding is that you need to start talking about your product in many places, start answering questions, dealing with feedback, and once you have some momentum, keep it.\n\nNow, like other people share in their comments, a first launch shouldn't take too much, the product should not be perfect. Rather, it should prove the point of solving a problem in a specific way. If people want it even if it looks ugly and fails, you got product-market fit. It must be cheap in the beginning.\n\nDo you have a different understanding of how to launch a product? I'd like to hear from you.",

In fact, [RedwoodSDK](https://rwsdk.com/) is currently in beta on their v1, and makes it REALLY easy to integrate with Cloudflare. Cloudflare is very powerful, but also a pain in the ass to work with when doing non-standard stuff (Vercel is probably going to be the same in all honesty).\n\nFrom personal anecdotal experience, I have [Omae3](https://oma3.vercel.app/) which is a character generator for an RPG called Shadowrun. It's running on Vercel, and I'm too cheap to pay for it. The code for it lives on [github](https://github.com/HeyOmae/OMA3) and the integration was extremely easy to set up. I had to jump through some hoops and set up the deploy on a personal repo, but that's once again, because I'm cheap and don't want to pay them. They also had some very nice metrics until I hit their cap and had to pay them. Which, if this was a business, I'd pay for, but it's a hobby app, that I'm building for the community and I don't give a shit about making money with, so I opted out.\n\nNow, with Cloudflare, I'm hosting 2 static sites ([test2doc.com](https://test2doc.com/) and [dethstrobe.com](https://dethstrobe.com/)) and these were trivial to set up and make integrations with. Which, makes sense, because Cloudflare is a CDN, static resources is kind of their bag.\n\nRedwoodSDK has been interesting, I've worked through their tutorial, which gives a nice CRUD app to build out and use some of Cloudflare's cool tech like durable objects to persist data. And it's very easy to use, but I have ran in to a few small bugs while working locally that forced me to nuke the DB and rebuild and rerun migrations and seeds. It's quick to get back to working state, but I do have some concerns that might be more edge cases since it is so new. But I personally don't mind bleeding a bit while being on the cutting edge.\n\nI guess it depends on how much money you have vs how much tolerance for putting up with integration friction. If you're cheap and don't mind a bit of pain, cloudflare. If you don't mind burning money, but want an easier time vercel.\n\nAlso, just to throw out a few other alternatives. [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is really easy to work with and cheap. I've heard good things about [fly.io](http://fly.io), but I haven't tried them yet. [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) is fantastic and cheap, but you have to set up everything yourself. And of course, there is always the big players like AWS, gCloud, and Azure. But I think big tech is actually a big pain in the ass, honestly not as cheap as the smaller player.",

Standard stuff like lawn maintenance, seasonal cleanups, mulching, the usual.\n\nAbout 8 months ago I had this one client who kept asking if I could pressure wash their driveway while I was already there doing their yard. I said sure whatever, charged them like $75 extra just to not deal with scheduling another visit. Took me maybe 30 mins.\n\nWord got around I guess because then other clients started asking. I figured why not, easy add on right? Fast forward to now and I'm getting calls specifically for pressure washing. Like people don't even want the landscaping part anymore they just want their driveways, decks, house siding done.\n\nDid the math last week and the pressure washing stuff brought in almost double what the landscaping did last month. I've got some money saved up from the busy season and Stаke so I could buy better equipment and actually pivot to this full time but it feels weird abandoning what I started with?\n\nAnyone else deal with something like this where a side thing accidentally became the main thing?

Always be open to pivot to new opportunities. \n\nI built a multi million dollar business off of a similar scenario. \n\nI had a customer about 15 years ago ask me to fix a device in their business that no one had ever repaired before. These were considered \"throw-away\" devices. They'd last maybe 5 years and then would break somehow and the business owner would have to buy a new one for anywhere from $5k - $12k depending on the brand because no one provided repair services.\n\nSo we offered to try and repair it. We did basically the same thing you did, $100 and we'll try to repair it. We were successful. I wrote a blog post about it on our company website and within a week we started getting calls about the service. It was crazy. We started receiving 10+ calls per day about this service. We completely pivoted our focus to only this service.\n\nTo find our pricing we simply kept on increasing prices until people started pushing back.  So now we charge about $1,200 for a service that costs us a couple hundred to provide.\n\nNow we're nationwide and Repair about 10,000 of these devices per year and growing. Sure there's competitors now, all who have spawned from ex employees, but we're doing great. Totally life changing.",

      "selftext": "I run a small accounting consultancy. One client pays me $5k/month and has been with me for almost 2 years. They're literally almost half my revenue.\n\nThe problem: they're a nightmare. Disorganized records, last-minute requests every week, constant \"urgent\" messages on weekends. They treat deadlines like suggestions. Last month I stayed up until 2am 3 nights in a row because they send me a box of receipts the day before their filing deadline.\n\nEveryone tells me to stop serving them. My partner says I'm miserable every Sunday night. My friends say no client is worth this stress.\n\nBut here's the thing - $5k/month is $5k/month. That's half my income. If I fire them, I'd need to replace that with 2-3 smaller clients, and I barely have time to do sales because this client eats up all my time.\n\nSo I'm stuck in this loop of keeping them = good income, constant stress, no time to grow or Fxxk them off = happy life, almost 50% revenue cut, risk of not replacing the revenue\n\nI have about 4 months savings. Part of me thinks \"just rip the band-aid off\" but then I panic about paying rent.\n\nHas anyone been in this situation? What did you do? I need to make a decision soon because I'm burning out fast.\n\nHappy but broke, or stressed but paid?",

This isn’t sustainable. As you mentioned, you are rapidly approaching burnout. \n\nHere’s a viable approach to consider:\n\nSend a message to ALL clients, about your company implementing new policies and fees. \n\nEffective immediately:\n\nWe value our clients…\n\n“To continue to provide exceptional service to our valued clients at the highest level and run an efficient accounting firm you can trust, we are implementing the following changes.\n\nList out your new policies and rates:\n\nCommunication policy:\n\nWe no longer respond to messages received past 5:00 pm. \n\nMessages received will be responded to within 24 business hours.

Send an email to inquiries@your accounting firm dot com or schedule a zoom meeting through our online scheduling system (if you want that as an option).\n\nIF you have done ALL of this and they still behave in a way that doesn’t align with how you run your business, then absolutely. You have to part way with this client. \n\nAlso, you should always be sourcing for new clients. As a business owner you can’t and shouldn’t rely on 1-3 clients. \n\nKeep prospects in the pipeline. \n\nHope this helps a bit! All the best to you!",

Nights/weekends/holidays? That guy gets OT and so should you. \n\nTwo boxes of late receipts… “well, we won’t be able to get this filed on time.” Add a late rush fee on the bill. \n\nWon’t get you ban statements for reconciliation in time? Use that time to find new clients. When they bring it late, do it at your normal pace. You’re training your client at the same time, so I wouldn’t flip around the first time and drag feet. Start gradually slowing down to a normal pace. His failure to meet your deadline doesn’t mean you should be bending over backwards now to meet his. \n\nFamily business is a tax office/business consulting firm, doing accounting and payroll. We tell folks to have docs in 5 days before an IRS deadline or it’s an automatic extension or late filing. If they get the documents in after our deadline, we do the extension and then do the tax return the week after the deadline. We can’t do “last minute” work for every client. \n\nNow, doing payroll and bookkeeping/accounting has generally helped tremendously. I’ve got access to a bunch of their tax documents ahead of time and now don’t have to wait for their P+L, W2, whatever. Firm is up to ~250 clients, 40% of that growth over the last two years. Remember, CPA’s are aging out and retiring, while new grads aren’t meeting those numbers. BLS estimates ~110-120k retiring and 30-40k entering. Finding new clients will be super easy. Tell your existing clients they’ll get 10% off if they bring you a new client. We only take referrals, zero advertising. \n\nThe other thing that’s been a huge help is doing the business consulting piece and helping people do their AOI, EIN, 2553, etc filings. We now have a client from the start, set them up on QB, price out basic bookkeeping services at $75/month, and we tell them to let us know when they’re ready for payroll. They now bring us their business tax return, personal tax return, parent/sibling/neighbor tax return, then these new business owners go to some networking event to push their business and tell the other new business owner about how our service got them up and running inside of two weeks. Now we get another phone call and help close out the other business owner’s 2553, QB setup, then get their business tax return, personal tax return, sibling’s tax return… it’s quite easy.\n\nDM if you’d like.

But one of the benefits of working for yourself is to not have to deal with things like this if you don’t want to. The other issue is that inevitably a big mistake is going to be made from your end if you’re always having to do everything so rushed and last minute with no review time, and they’ll blame you. If you have four months of savings, talk to them, and if they don’t straighten up release them and immediately go on a sales blitz and find a couple smaller clients to take their place. \n\nAlso, I learned the lesson about taking on clients that cover too much of my revenue draw. They have undue control over your business. Multiples smaller clients tend to be better because it’s easier to let go of a client that wouldn’t greatly reduce your income and are easier to replace. Multiple small clients gives you more control.",

Most orgs consider the cost of redundant infrastructure and assume there will be rare outages and that is just the cost of doing business. \n\nBut even when I managed colo in geographically separate data centers no one wanted to pay for true redundancy because it means having the gear hot at independent locations - that's not a cloud problem. \n\nMoreover, that gear is worthless if you aren't routinely testing it and running it as production gear occasionally. \n\nDoctora still have pagers not because they can't get alerts to cell phones, but because it's an i dependent band to be contacted on. The cell towers could implode and they'd still get pages (this is hyperbole for effect, please don't start a thread on how pagers work). It's worth paying for the redundancy in mission critical applications. That just rarely involves small business.",

I would usually charge $60 for a project like this but gave her a discount and told her it would be $50. I prefaced it by saying that cost conversations with friends/coworkers can be awkward, but that custom cupcakes are time consuming and then shared the price. She said “$50 for 12 cupcakes?!” My face turned bright red and I was like “um yeah… if you want I can do toppers rather than a custom design and lower the price.” And then she was like “no, I want to showcase your design so it’s fine, I’ll pay the full amount” as if she is doing me a favor… \n\nI’m guessing this is a common experience for small business owners. Just looking for some solidarity because even though I know she was wrong, I’m still feeling mortified. Also wondering if this price sounds shocking to anyone else? Thanks for reading❤️",

Be confident in your pricing. “I usually charge $60, but for you I’ll do it for $50. Sounds fair?” And let them respond. Your response of adjusting the product to meet their price point was perfect. It gives them options in their price point so they feel like they’re in the drivers seat.",

My very first job at 20 something years old was fixing a residential window for someone which I priced just barely above my cost with the hope of it turning into referrals and more work. I gave them an estimate and no more than 5 min later they called insulting me and telling me I’m ridiculously expensive. It crushed me because I didn’t really know what I was doing on pricing anyways and was afraid because I wasn’t making hardly anything as it was! \n\nYears later, I wouldn’t even flinch over people like that. It happens all time and we politely let them know premium service doesn’t come at Jim Bob the handyman’s price. We hear two things about my business, we’re the best at what we do, and we’re expensive. I sleep like a baby. \n\nMy advice, your prices are probably just fine, your boss just isn’t the right customer for you. (And that’s okay)",

      "selftext": "We operate a horseback riding business. Obviously, this requires physical ability and makes people prone to injury as they are getting on/off horses. Over the past few years, we have had families bring elderly relatives - people in their 80s and 90s, some with very frail bones or broken hips. This is extremely dangerous as they cannot easily get on/off the horse. Some of them are so immobile they cannot even walk from their cars to our staging area let alone get on a horse.\n\nToday we had an elderly fall off the horse and smash her head open.\n\nI want to be able to legally refuse service to people in such a condition. Here is the problem, federal law (Age Discrimination Act of 1975) does not permit us to discriminate based on age or disability. So we are in a gray area here.\n\nI do not want elderly people who are physically immobile to use our service and if they show up I want to be able to legally deny them, but I do not want to violate federal discrimination laws (such as Age Discrimination Act of 1975) and get sued. Are there any out clauses in the law that we can use for denying service based on it being say \"a risk to that person's safety\" or something? Of course I don't know if we are subject to federal age discrimination laws as we are a private company and do not receive federal funding.\n\nDoes anyone know a way around this. I'm thinking if we make a 'safety and risk' policy for ALL customers instead of just elderly that would work. Any info would be appreciated.\n\n  \nWe do have liability waivers customers sign but I still do not want people getting injured.",

The course had spaces that blocked bodies of all ages who couldn't complete the course and we had an addendum you had to sign that if you get \"stuck' we would be rescuing you with our privately owned rescue services for $3000 an hour. \n\nWe reduced our course completion failure from 20% to 1% and increased our revenue because despite stopping a good amount of people from buying tickets, the ones who didn't make it through the obstacle course or decided not to go up with their group, they still bought pizza and played coin operated games instead of shutting down the course and blubbering for 45 minutes as our team dragged them back down the mountain. \n\nIf I were you, I'd buy a big draft horse statue and require all participants to climb over it to qualify for the riding experience. Add in that you can make exceptions to this rule if needed and then you can quietly let kids or anyone you need to skip the requirement but not great aunt Agnes. \n\nHere is the most important part though, set up a nice waiting area so Agnes has something to do somewhere. Mount a TV in the tack room, add a few chairs and play Seabiscuit on a loop. Psychologically no one wants Agnes on the horse they just don't want her sitting in a hot car while they have fun. If you give her a chair and a vending machine somewhere they will ditch her there and feel zero pressure to put her on a horse. It doesn't have to be fancy it just has to look like whoever doesn't go riding will have somewhere to be that is shaded and comfortable. \n\nWe started with just a few seats and a shelf of books and eventually built it up to a pay-fridge, microwave and some pinball machines which paid for themselves immediately.",

          "body": "honestly, the safest way to handle this isn’t by refusing based on age or disability, it’s by defining clear, objective safety criteria for everyone. you’re not denying access; you’re setting a standard of safe participation. instead of saying “we don’t allow elderly riders,” your policy should describe the physical requirements of the activity. for example: riders must be able to mount and dismount independently, maintain balance for a certain period, and walk a specific distance without assistance. those aren’t discriminatory rules, they’re operational standards tied directly to the nature of horseback riding. it’s the same principle used in zipline parks or rock climbing gyms.\n\nyou can also include a clause in your waiver or website that says something like: “for the safety of all guests and animals, participation may be refused if staff determine a rider cannot safely meet the physical requirements of the activity.” that gives you discretion to act responsibly without targeting anyone personally. the key here isn’t to “refuse” service; it’s to define readiness. once your standards are clear and applied equally to all customers, you’re not discriminating, you’re protecting your riders, your staff, and your business from unnecessary risk.",

It's relatively inexpensive and easy if you do it yourself. And then, again, hopefully *that* kickstarts their ass into gear and they just pay it or offer to settle to keep it from escalating to court. If they still won't pay, then it's time to go to court, and for that you need an actual lawyer. You could try to represent yourself but generally that's not a great idea, but if you do hire a lawyer you should know you're probably going to pay as much (if not more) than you recover from the client. If you try to represent yourself, you could potentially recover a lot more of the money for yourself but you're also more likely to lose.\n\nThey probably have limited cash with which to pay their vendors right now. The squeakiest wheel gets the grease first, and right now you're not one of their squeakiest wheels. In other words, they're only paying the bills that are causing them the biggest problems right now. And you're not one of them.

I would not be inclined to go the legal route without one.\n\n1.  Does the contract say anything about recovering attorney's fees?  If Yes, then send a demand letter, reference that section in the contract and make it clear that on mm/dd/yyyy this matter is getting turned over to your attorney and the legal fees that \"YOU Mr. Client will be responsible for,\" start adding up.  If No, then now is the time to add that language to your contracts going forward.  I would still send the demand letter and note that you will be seeking attorney's fees, just be a little less specific about the details.  Whether or not you actually CAN recover such costs at the end of the day is a question for your attorney.\n\n2.  Does the client have assets?  Can they be made to pay up if you win?  Only $14k, I would expect so, but if not, it might not be worth the bother because you could get a settlement and not be able to collect anything.  If Yes to both 1 and 2, then hand it off to an attorney to go after them for the $14k plus costs.  If No to 1, but Yes, to 2, then you just gotta make a judgement call.  I'd figure legal expenses would be $5k minimum if it ends up actually going to court.  You could probably get away with less if a lawyer's demand letter or the court filing itself is enough to get them to pay up.  I think it's worth doing, but you have to understand that you might be throwing good money after bad.  Court is always an expensive gamble.\n\nMost deadbeats will pay up once you actually file in court.  Some will just ignore it, never respond, and never show up at court.  Still others will fight you to the absolute bitter end even if they have little hope of victory.  A-holes gonna A-hole.",

Then I tried GetResponse, and for the first time it just clicked. It literally took me 30 minutes to set up my first email funnel and I was already collecting leads that same night.\n\nThe biggest difference for me: ✅ drag-and-drop automation that’s actually visual (no code) ✅ built-in landing pages and sign-up forms (no need for extra tools) ✅ free plan to test everything — no credit card, no traps ✅ and it doesn’t feel like you need a PhD to use it\n\nIf you’re a small business owner or someone trying to start affiliate/online sales, this thing’s a time-saver. It basically runs in the background while you sleep.\n\nYou can check it out here 👉 https://www.getresponse.com?a=rETjTTWvkJ\n\n(They have a 30-day free trial — I started there and never switched back.)\n\nJust sharing this because I wish someone told me earlier before I spent weeks struggling with other tools. Hope it helps someone here too. 🚀",

You can appeal and wait 30 days.”\n\nNo reason given.\n\nNo summary of their decision.\n\nNo timeline to recover my funds.\n\nResult:\n\n\\- €50,000 frozen\n\n\\- Business operations halted\n\n\\- Dozens of detailed emails ignored, no clear response\n\n\\- My opinion after this experience\n\nWise is no longer a reliable solution for professionals.\n\nThey act like a bank — but without transparency, accountability, or logic.\n\nTheir compliance team feels robotic, demanding contradictory and absurd documents, often impossible for small businesses to provide.\n\nAnd the worst part: they can shut down your account without warning, even if your file is clean.\n\nHonestly, it’s shameful.\n\nI regret ever trusting them.\n\nIf your business relies on Wise — withdraw your funds while you still can.\n\n❓Questions for the community\n\nHas anyone else here had their Wise account closed with money stuck inside?\n\nHow long did it take before you got your funds back?",

          "body": "Yes! Leadership in general is a muscle that needs to grow in the beginning but firing is always hard. My mentor always said the day firing is easy is the day you shouldn't be a leader. You need to make the right decision for your business but it's not easy knowing that person is losing their job. Especially in a small business, you more than likely know their family or at least know about them.  We should always maintain our compassion.\n\nThis is probably my driving force behind hiring very carefully, because I haaaate terminating. I like using interview guides with predetermined questions and 1-3 answer ratings so I'm very clear on who I need to hire and my notes are the data to back them up. I like pretty much everyone when I meet them and the interview is the best you're going to get.  I never hire on the spot and typically try to have someone else I trust in the interview for additional perspective.  I always give myself time after the interview to really think through their answers.\n\nI have seen so many things go wrong when clients wait to fire too. They put it off and every single time, it ends in a dumpster fire. Property damage, reputation with vendors or customers destroyed, workmans comp injuries- I've heard/witnessed some wild stories. \n\nKeep performance notes so you can make an educated decision and have regular performance conversations with your employees so it's not a surprise. This also keeps your top employees happy because seeing poor behavior or poor performance tolerated will demotivate them right out the door.",

They are limiting in customization as you noted, but do most small businesses need that maximum customization? They can still be customized to a decent extent.\n\nFor most small businesses, their traffic will be 80%+ mobile devices. \n\nWordpress is great, but not a DIY platform for the majority of business owners (plus their time is likely spent elsewhere).\n\n\nThen there are other platforms, such as Ontraport which is an excellent website builder, also comes with CMS, marketing automation, and other features. Though that all comes with a larger monthly bill.",

I’ve read that if you buy from the wrong site especially those that use bots, your account could get flagged or the followers will just disappear in a few days.\n\nHas anyone here found a legit site that provides real looking followers that actually stay? I’d really appreciate hearing which service you used and whether it felt worth it in the long run.\n\nHere’s what I’m trying to figure out:\n\n* What’s the best place to buy real Instagram followers that don’t drop overnight?\n* Can buying Instagram followers actually help with reach or engagement?\n* Which sites sell safe, high-quality Instagram followers that look authentic?\n\nAny recommendations are appreciated!",

I inherited a “Frankenstein” setup where Excel said one thing, Intune said another, and half the inventory existed only in people’s memories.\n\nIf you’re hitting thousands of assets and want something that *actually scales* and ties into your Microsoft stack, take a look at AssetSonar. It plugs directly into Intune and Azure AD, so you can automatically sync enrolled devices, users, and software data instead of chasing spreadsheets. It’s built for distributed setups. I work for IT in a construction company. We have warehouses, remote teams, contractors, all that chaos.\n\nWe're using AssetSonar to track every hardware and software asset. We also brought in devices from Intune, JAMF, SCCM, and similar tools. We do use role-based access so regional teams see only what’s relevant. AssetSonar also helps track license compliance which is huge if you've O365 or Adobe suites your employees are using.\n\nWe switched to it about a year ago and it immediately exposed a ton of ghost devices and duplicate records that were invisible in Excel. Once everything was normalized, audits stopped being a nightmare.\n\nIf you just need something quick to pilot, they do have a free trial. Try spinning it up, connecting Intune and you’ll see your inventory appear in minutes. Even if you don’t end up keeping it, it’ll show you what single source of truth actually looks like.",

She’s great with organization, social media strategy, and client communication basically all the things I struggle to stay consistent with. On paper it makes total sense, but I can’t help wondering how it might affect the relationship long-term. We get along really well, but mixing business and personal life can get tricky fast. If we argue about something work related, it could easily bleed into everything else.  \nFor those of you who’ve brought your spouse or partner into your company how did you make it work?

Business convos end at a set time each day. No work talk in bed or on weekends.\n4.

He wasn’t lazy or unskilled. At the beginning he was one of the most reliable people on the team. But over time something shifted. Tasks took longer, communication became distant, and it started to feel like he was working just to fill hours instead of driving things forward.\n\nIt wasn’t dramatic or toxic, just that slow fade where motivation disappears. We tried to talk things through, but nothing really changed. In the end, keeping him on didn’t feel fair to him or to us.\n\nWhat surprised me most was how heavy it felt afterward. I actually liked the guy, and I kept wondering if I could have done more to help him reconnect. The next day, I spoke with another developer who has been working with us for a while, consistent, reliable, never any drama. I took a moment to thank her for her work, and she seemed genuinely touched.\n\nIt made me realize how often we forget to appreciate the people who quietly do things right until something goes wrong somewhere else.\n\nHave you been through something similar in your business? How did you handle it on your side?",

They don't, and won't, and it's crazy to expect otherwise. No one will ever give a shit about your business as much as the owners of the business, and you can't ever expect them to.\n\nSounds like you let a good relationship end because you couldn't set proper terms.\n\nedit: also generally speaking, sometimes employees are overambitious early on, think of it as the \"honeymoon stage\", they might feel like they have something to prove, or be all starry-eyed, and reality is that it can just fade over time, especially if their expectations are not in line with reality, if they had high hopes for things, and eventually realize that reality is not as glamorous or exciting as they imagined. We all like to gas ourselves up like we're great employers, but sometimes employees also feel undercompensated (and sometimes are actually undercompensated relative to the market) and that's something else that can disillusion them. So it's completely normal to see an employee who was once a star, eventually fade into \"just average\" over time. It sucks but it's normal.",

Burned through 15k with almost nothing to show for it. Finally hired someone who knew what they were doing and sales tripled in two months. I should have done that from day one but I was being cheap and thought I could learn it myself.\n\nSecond mistake was going with the cheapest manufacturer. Saved like 30 cents per unit but quality was garbage. Return rate was almost 15 percent and the negative reviews killed us. Took 8 months to recover our reputation after switching to a better supplier. That 30 cents ended up costing me probably 50k in lost sales and returns.\n\nThird one I just learned about this year. Got a legal letter about our website not being accessible to disabled people. Had no idea this was even a thing. The lawyer wanted 20k to settle and we had to scramble to actually fix the site. Apparently this happens to a lot of small ecommerce companies and nobody talks about it until it happens to them.\n\nEach of these felt like they came out of nowhere but looking back there were warning signs I just ignored. The manufacturer thing especially, I knew the quality wasn't great but kept making excuses.\n\nDoes anyone else have surprise expenses from stuff you didn't know you needed to worry about?",

I got the quote and, being the budget-conscious small business owner I am, I decided to cut the soft costs.\n\nThe manufacturer’s itemized quote was:\n\n* **Custom Sign Fabrication (with free delivery):** $3,000\n* **Permit Filing &amp; Management:** $900\n* **Nationwide Installation &amp; Project Management:** $1,800\n* **Total Quote:** $5,700\n\n**The Reality was a Disaster:**\n\n1. **I Ordered First:** The beautiful $3,000 sign was made and shipped.\n2. **The Permit Rejection:** I took a day off to file the permit. The city rejected it instantly. They had a hyper-specific height and distance code for the type of sign I chose that I completely missed. The sign was illegal.\n3. **The True 'DIY' Cost:** I had to pay the original manufacturer another **$4,000** to completely tear down, re-fabricate a smaller sign, and expedite the new process. This was on top of the original $3,000 I already spent.\n\n**The Final Bill:** My $3,000 sign ended up costing me $7,000 (plus a 6-week delay to my grand opening).\n\n  \n**THE LESSON I WISH I'D LEARNED:**\n\n* The fabrication cost is the *least* complicated part. The $2,700 for the permit and install management was cheap insurance.\n* **That money isn't just for labor; it’s for expertise.** A national provider knows the thousands of different local codes across the U.S. and designs the sign to meet your permit requirements *before* production even starts.\n\nIf you are buying anything custom that needs city approval, **pay the full-service fee.** It’s the easiest $2,700 you'll ever spend. Learn from my mistake!\n\nWhat other hidden costs or required permits did you guys accidentally skip that came back to haunt you?\"",

          "body": "I’ve been in the sign business for over 20 years, and permitting has always been one of the most challenging parts of the process. Most sign companies, when applying for a permit on behalf of the customer, won’t begin production until the permit is officially approved. Even with plenty of experience navigating local regulations, I’ve still run into situations where a permit gets denied because of some strange interpretation of the rules by someone in the permitting office. Even when the permit office is mistaken, it can take weeks or months to get things sorted out. I've even had some customers who had to hire a lawyer to sue the town over how they interpret the rules.  I know of two towns with nearly identical sign codes that interpret and enforce them completely differently. In one town, the permit office won’t approve a sign permit until every other required permit is approved first. So even for those of us who deal with sign permitting regularly, the process can still be confusing.",
