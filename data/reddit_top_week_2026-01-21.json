      "selftext": "I bought a Chevrolet Colorado in July of last year with the intention of starting a side hustle. I considered doing landscaping, hauling junk, or even buying a vending machine. However, while browsing Facebook Marketplace, I came across a listing for a used throne chair. I decided to research how much these chairs typically rent for in other areas and what I could potentially charge if I bought one. Keep in mind, I had no prior experience in the party or event business.\n\nDespite that, I decided to take a chance, bought the chair, and posted it for rent. The post received a lot of views, but no bookings at first. Most businesses in my area charge around $150 to rent a throne chair, plus a delivery fee, which usually brings the total to $180–$200. Since I wasn’t getting much interest, I decided to lower my price from $150 to $120, which also includes delivery within 30 minutes of where I live.\n\nAfter about 3.5 weeks and spending roughly $760, I honestly started to think buying the throne chair had been a bad idea. However, just a couple of days after lowering the price, I received my first booking—then my second, third, and so on. As bookings picked up, I eventually purchased a second throne chair for about the same price, except this one was brand new.\n\nFrom the end of August through the end of December, I made a little over $1,500. While most of that money went toward paying off the chairs, it became clear that there is a lot of potential in this type of business. Along the way, I’ve connected with people from schools, event coordinators, venue owners, and other local businesses.\n\nMy goal for this year is to make over $4,000. While that may not sound like a lot, it’s relatively easy money. The hardest part of the job is loading the chairs onto the truck and properly taking care of them. I make sure to clean them after every event and use bubble wrap on the corners and other important areas that could be easily damaged. I also purchased a tarp and stretch wrap to protect the chairs from dirt during delivery or while they’re waiting for the next booking.\n\nMy next goal is to add a bench throne and a 360 photo booth to the business. We’ll see what the future holds.",

          "body": "If you already work in data or analytics, there are a few side incomes that tend to be realistic and actually leverage that skillset instead of starting from zero.\n\nA lot of people do analytics consulting for small businesses. Things like setting up GA4 properly, cleaning up dashboards, or explaining where traffic or conversions are leaking. Small ecommerce brands especially struggle with this and will pay for clarity.\n\nAnother angle is freelance reporting or dashboard builds. Many founders don’t want complex models, they just want a simple weekly or monthly view that answers “what’s working and what isn’t.” That’s a fast win if you know SQL, Looker, Power BI, or Tableau.\n\nSome go the data audit or tracking setup route. Reviewing event tracking, pixels, attribution, and fixing broken data. It’s boring work for founders but high value.\n\nLonger term, people turn their experience into templates, tools, or micro products like dashboards, attribution spreadsheets, or cohort analysis templates and sell those repeatedly instead of trading time.\n\nThe common thread is that the money usually comes from translating data into decisions, not just running numbers. Businesses pay when analytics directly help them make or save money.",

I saw that there was something like shopify and been trying that sort of but it's really confusing even with designs etc and even then I wouldn't be sure how to make use of it although its kind of set up haha. There's selling digital designs and again that's confusing.. I'm pretty shy and not too creative or artistic. I know there's feet finder and as a guy I don't really know if there's a market?   \nI just more so wanted some general help with a direction or advice or.. well, whatever you guys got!  \nthanks for sticking to the end and I'd appreciate any genuine ideas or advice, have a good one :)",

Please feel free to critique my idea, let me know how you would tweak it, and what you think works or doesn’t work\n\nI noticed that a lot of adult content creators like to use a link in their bio, and that there are a good amount of complaints that current link in bio platforms (LinkTree, Link.me) have been known to cause issues and have accounts on social media flagged, reducing the amount of viewers they are getting which is impacting their revenue\n\nI put together a site to try and capture this market, but am looking at how to improve it further before trying to get clients. The site is already live but I haven’t advertised it in any way yet, and includes made up example link in bio pages\n\nEssentially I want to run a subscription model to create ultra basic link in bio sites, but on their own domain to avoid being flagged. Additional benefits over traditional link in bio services is that it is ad free, and that I am directly serving them so won’t make a policy change later down the line that no longer allows adult content creators.\n\nSo in all, it’s just selling websites as a subscription, niched down to adult content creators that want a unique link in bio on their own domain. By stripping back the features of standard websites, I can make them very cheap, quick and easily.\n\nI want to know if this sounds like something that could work, or if it’s fundamentally flawed with something I missed before taking the next steps of finding customers",

She told her friend at church about it and next thing I know I have 3 more people asking me to do it.\n\nI bought a decent video capture device on Amazon (the Elgato one, around $80) and started posting on local Facebook groups. Turns out theres SO many boomers and gen x folks who have boxes of old tapes, camcorder videos, and even those weird mini DV tapes sitting in their garage that they want digitized but have no idea how to do it.\n\nI charge $15 per tape for VHS and $20 for camcorder tapes cause they take a bit longer. Most people have like 10 to 30 tapes so the jobs add up quick. December was insane cause everyone wanted them done before the holidays, made around $950 that month. Its slowed down a bit now but still getting steady work.\n\nI can literally just let the tapes run while I'm working my regular job from home or watching TV. I also upload everything to a google drive folder for them and burn it to a DVD if they want (extra $5). Some people tip really well too cause they get emotional seeing their old family videos.\n\nNow I actually have $2k set aside from Stаke, but I'm kinda stuck on how to scale this up beyond just me doing it. I can only run like 2 or 3 tapes at a time with my current setup. Anyone have ideas on how to grow this without it turning into a full time thing? Or should I just keep it small and steady?",

          "body": "This is actually a really solid little business, and you stumbled into it the best way possible: by solving a real, emotional problem people already care about.\n\nA few things stand out to me. First, the demand you’re seeing isn’t a fad. People aren’t suddenly *creating* more VHS tapes, but the urgency is real because those tapes are literally degrading every year. Add the emotional angle and holidays, and you’ve got something people are happy to pay for and even tip on. That’s rare.\n\nOn scaling, the key is not trying to turn this into some startup-looking thing. The moment you do, it becomes stressful. The simplest way to grow without burning yourself out is parallelization. More capture devices, more VCRs, and a slightly better workflow so you can run 5–8 tapes at once instead of 2–3. That’s boring advice, but it works. Your time doesn’t really increase, throughput does.\n\nAnother option is raising prices slightly or adding “convenience” upsells. Faster turnaround, pickup/drop-off, better labeling, cloud + physical backup bundles. You’re not just selling digitization, you’re selling peace of mind and nostalgia, and people pay for that. Especially the same demographic you’re already serving.\n\nIf you want to keep it part-time, I’d avoid hiring or expanding too fast. Managing people and other people’s mistakes is what turns a chill side hustle into a headache. Keeping it small and reliable is a feature, not a flaw.\n\nThe biggest green flag here is that customers are emotional and grateful. That usually means you’re doing something right and you’re priced reasonably, maybe even a bit low. I’d optimize for calm, steady income and low stress rather than “scaling” in the startup sense.\n\nSometimes the best businesses are the ones that quietly print money and don’t demand your soul. This sounds like one of those.",

      "selftext": "**TL;DR:** I got laid off in late 2024, saw a post on this subreddit about ElevenLabs voice cloning, and thought \"why not.\" 13 months later, I have 8 AI voice clones earning me over $1,000/month while I sleep. This is the detailed guide I wish I had when I started. I'll show you exactly how to do it, step by step.\n\n---\n\n## The Real Numbers–No Clickbait Here\n\nLet me just get this out of the way:\n\n* **Total earned to date:** $8,985\n* **Current monthly earnings:** ~$1,160/month\n* **Number of voices:** 8\n* **Time invested per month now:** Maybe 1-2 hours (checking stats, occasionally tweaking things)\n* **Full portfolio breakdown PDF (with earnings screenshots):** [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QpjMjdh4MU4vIadC6ZjSYqKWwhF4Puf2/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nI'm sharing my actual numbers because I've seen too many low-effort posts on this sub that say \"you can make money with AI voices!\" and then provide zero details. That's not helpful. This guide is going to be long, but by the end, you'll know exactly how to do this yourself.\n\n---\n\n## My Story\n\nIn late 2024, I got laid off. Not ideal, but I suddenly had time to explore side income ideas I'd been bookmarking for months.\n\nI stumbled across a post on this very subreddit about licensing your voice on ElevenLabs. The concept was simple: record your voice, upload it to their platform, and get paid every time someone uses it for their projects (YouTube videos, audiobooks, apps, whatever).\n\nI have a background in audio engineering, so I figured I had a slight edge. But honestly, the technical barrier is way lower than I expected. If you can follow instructions and speak clearly into a microphone, you can do this.\n\nI created my first voice, and within a few weeks, I was making a couple hundred dollars. I immediately created another. Then another.\n\n**Here's what most posts don't tell you: the real strategy is building a portfolio of voices, not just one.**\n\nMy top-performing voice averages $308/month. But I have another that only makes $16/month. If I'd stopped at one voice and it happened to be the $16 one, I probably would've given up and told everyone this doesn't work.\n\nInstead, I kept going. Now I have 8 voices across different categories, and the portfolio as a whole is what makes this a legit income stream.\n\n---\n\n## What Is Voice Cloning? Let me explain.\n\nElevenLabs is an AI company that offers text-to-speech technology. Users can type text and have it spoken aloud by AI voices.\n\nHere's where you come in: ElevenLabs has a Voice Library where creators can upload their voice clones and license them to other users. Every time someone uses your voice to generate audio, you get paid.\n\n**Who uses these voices?**\n\n* YouTubers and content creators\n* Audiobook producers\n* App developers\n* Podcasters\n* Game developers\n* Businesses making training videos\n* People creating voiceovers for social media\n\nThe demand is massive and growing. AI-generated voiceovers are everywhere now, and people need high-quality, natural-sounding voices.\n\n---\n\n## What You'll Need Before Starting\n\n**The Essentials:**\n\n1. **A decent microphone.** You don't need a $500 setup. A solid USB condenser mic like the Audio-Technica AT2020 (~$100) or even the Fifine K669B (~$30) can work. The key is clarity, not expense.\n2. **A quiet recording space.** This matters more than your mic. A closet full of clothes actually makes a great recording booth. You want minimal echo and no background noise (no AC humming, no traffic, no roommates).\n3. **Basic audio software.** Audacity is free and works great. GarageBand if you're on Mac. I personally use Pro Tools, but that's overkill for this.\n4. **30+ minutes of high-quality audio.** This is ElevenLabs' minimum requirement for a Professional Voice Clone. More on what to record later.\n5. **An ElevenLabs Creator Plan.** That's $22/month ($11 for your first month with the 50% discount). This is your only ongoing cost. [More on this below]\n\n**Optional But Helpful:**\n\n* A pop filter (~$10) to reduce plosive sounds (harsh \"P\" and \"B\" sounds)\n* A mic stand or boom arm to keep positioning consistent\n* Basic knowledge of audio editing (removing breaths, normalizing levels)\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Set Up Your ElevenLabs Account\n\nHead to ElevenLabs and create an account. Here's my link: [https://try.elevenlabs.io/earn-with-voice-clones](https://try.elevenlabs.io/earn-with-voice-clones)\n\nIt takes you straight to the pricing page where you can grab 50% off your first month. If this guide saves you from the 13 months of trial and error it took me to figure all this out, using the link is an easy way to say thanks. I get a small kickback at no extra cost to you.\n\n**Important:** You need the Creator Plan (minimum $22/month after month 1) to create Professional Voice Clones. ElevenLabs has a free tier and a Starter Plan, but unfortunately you can't create Professional voice clones with either of them.\n\nAlso, here's something most guides don't mention: **Each Creator Plan account only allows ONE Professional Voice Clone.**\n\nThey offer a Business plan which allows up to 3 Professional Voice Clones, but they charge $1,320/month for that… ridiculous. I know.\n\nSo, if you want to build a portfolio like I did (which I highly recommend), you'll need to create multiple accounts. Each account is $22/month with the Creator Plan, but even a mediocre voice should earn enough to cover that cost within a few weeks. My worst-performing voice still makes ~$16/month, and most of mine pay for themselves many times over.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: The Most Important Part: Record Your Audio\n\nYou need at least 30 minutes of clean, high-quality audio. But here's what nobody tells you:\n\n**What you record matters as much as how you record it.**\n\nThe AI learns your voice patterns, inflections, and style from your recording. If you record yourself reading a novel in a calm, steady narration voice, your clone will sound great for audiobooks but weird for energetic social media content.\n\n**Match your recording to your intended use case:**\n\n| If you want your voice used for... | Record yourself... |\n|---|---|\n| Audiobooks / Narration | Reading fiction or non-fiction passages |\n| Podcasts | Having a conversational monologue |\n| Meditation / Relaxation | Speaking slowly and soothingly |\n| YouTube explainers | Explaining topics in an engaging way |\n| Character voices | Doing the character consistently |\n\n**Recording Tips:**\n\n1. **Stay consistent.** Same mic position, same distance, same room, same energy level throughout.\n2. **Avoid mouth sounds.** Stay hydrated. Do a few takes if you get clicky mouth sounds.\n3. **Leave room tone.** Record 10 seconds of silence (just the room) at the start. This helps with noise removal later.\n4. **Don't over-edit.** Light noise removal is fine, but heavy processing can confuse the AI. Keep it natural.\n5. **Aim for -6dB to -3dB peaks.** Not too quiet, not clipping. Audacity has a great normalizing feature for this.\n6. **Record more than 30 minutes.** I usually aim for 45-60 minutes of raw audio, which gives me 30+ minutes of clean, edited content.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Create Your Professional Voice Clone\n\nOnce you have your audio files ready:\n\n1. Click \"Voices\" in the left sidebar\n2. Click \"Create or Clone a Voice\"\n3. Select \"Professional Voice Clone\"\n4. Accept the terms\n\nNow you'll need to:\n\n**Name your voice.** Pick something memorable and fitting. \"Calm Sarah\" or \"Energetic Mike\" tells users what to expect better than \"Voice\\_Final\\_v2.\"\n\n**Write a description.** Be specific about what your voice is good for. Example: \"A warm, friendly American male voice perfect for explainer videos, podcasts, and corporate narration. Clear articulation with a conversational tone.\"\n\n**Add tags.** These are crucial for discoverability. Just click through the dropdowns to find the most relevant options for your voice.\n\n**Upload your audio.** You can upload multiple files. Make sure they total at least 30 minutes.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Verify Your Voice\n\nElevenLabs requires voice verification to prove you're uploading your own voice (not stealing someone else's).\n\n**Here's how it works:**\n\n1. ElevenLabs generates a random sentence\n2. You record yourself reading it\n3. Their AI compares your verification recording to your uploaded audio\n4. If they match, you're verified\n\nThis is where most people mess up. The verification is picky. Here's how to pass it on the first try:\n\n* **Do it right after recording.** Stuff like humidity, sleep, or too much coffee can change your voice tone just enough to mess up the verification.\n* **Use the exact same setup.** Same mic, same room, same distance, same position.\n* **Match your energy.** If your uploaded audio was calm, verify calmly. If it was energetic, bring that energy.\n* **You only get a few attempts.** Too many failures and you'll get locked out temporarily.\n\n**Pro tip:** If you're using audio processing (EQ, compression, etc.) on your uploaded recordings, you'll want that same processing on your verification recording.\n\nI use a free tool called BlackHole (Mac) to route my DAW's processed output back into the verification recording. This way, my verification sounds identical to my uploaded audio. If you're on Windows, VoiceMeeter does the same thing.\n\nOnce submitted, the voice takes 2-6 hours to process. You'll get an email when it's ready.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Create a Killer Voice Preview\n\nThis is your sales pitch. When users browse the Voice Library, they'll hear a short preview of each voice. You want yours to stand out.\n\n1. Go to Voices → My Voices\n2. Click the \"a\" icon to generate speech with your voice\n3. Create a preview that's 70-150 characters (aim for close to 150)\n\n**Two approaches:**\n\n**Option A: Speak directly to the listener**\n\n\"Hey there! I'm Jake, and I'm here to make your content sound amazing. Whether it's a podcast, YouTube video, or audiobook, let's create something great together.\"\n\n**Option B: Demonstrate your voice's purpose**\n\n\"The morning mist rolled across the valley as she opened the letter, her hands trembling with anticipation. Today would change everything.\"\n\n**Dial in the settings:**\n\nPlay with the sliders (speed, stability, exaggeration) and generate multiple versions until you get one that sounds natural and represents your voice well.\n\n**Important:** As of now, you can only use V2 voice models for previews. I've had the best results with \"Eleven Multilingual v2.\" I think it sounds closest to the original voice.\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Publish to the Voice Library\n\nTime to go live:\n\n1. Click the three dots (⋮) next to your voice\n2. Click \"Share voice\"\n3. Toggle \"Sharing\" to ON\n4. Toggle \"Publish to the Voice Library\" to ON\n\n**Note:** If you use a VPN, turn it off for this step. The sharing toggle sometimes doesn't appear with VPNs enabled. Weird bug, but it got me stuck for an hour.\n\n**Settings to configure:**\n\n* **Live moderation** prevents your voice from being used for adult content. Disabling it maximizes earnings potential (more users can access your voice), but it's a personal choice.\n* **Custom Voice Preview** is where you select your best generation from Step 5.\n* **Notice Period** determines how long existing users can keep using your voice after you remove it. Longer notice periods mean higher revenue share. I recommend 6 months or more.\n* **Submit your voice name.** Follow ElevenLabs' naming format. You can't change this later, so make it count.\n\nAfter submission, a human (I think) reviews your voice. During business hours, approval usually takes less than 24 hours. Weekend submissions might wait until Monday.\n\n---\n\n## Step 7: Set Up Payouts\n\nYou need to connect a bank account to get paid:\n\n1. Click your profile picture (top right)\n2. Click \"Payouts\"\n3. Click \"Create payout account\"\n4. Follow the prompts to set up Stripe Express\n\nPayouts happen weekly. You can watch your earnings accumulate in real-time on the Payouts page.\n\n**Tax note for US folks:** ElevenLabs doesn't withhold taxes. They'll send you a 1099-MISC at year end. Set aside money for taxes. I put away about 25-30% of my voice earnings just to be safe. You can also write off the subscription fees as a deduction, so make sure to keep receipts!\n\n---\n\n## The Strategy That 10x'd My Earnings\n\nOkay, you've got one voice live. Here's how to actually make real money:\n\n**Build a Portfolio**\n\nOne voice is a lottery ticket. A portfolio is a strategy.\n\nMy 8 voices span different categories:\n\n* Meditation / Calm (my top earner at ~$309/month)\n* Narration (2 voices, ~$120/month combined)\n* Conversational / Podcast (~$110/month)\n* Character voices (~$100/month)\n* ASMR (2 newer voices, too early to judge)\n\n**Why multiple voices?**\n\n* Different users search for different things. Your voice might be perfect for multiple categories, but each voice can only have one primary category.\n* Hedges your bets. If one voice flops, others might carry you.\n* Compounds over time. 8 voices earning $100/month beats 1 voice earning $300/month.\n\n**\"But I only have one voice!\"**\n\nNo, you have many. Try:\n\n* Different pitch ranges (speak higher, speak lower)\n* Different energy levels (calm vs. energetic)\n* Different speeds (slow and deliberate vs. quick and punchy)\n* Different personas (professional vs. casual vs. warm vs. authoritative)\n* Character voices if you can do them\n\nEach variation = new voice = new account = new income stream.\n\n**Reverse-Engineer What Works**\n\nBefore creating a new voice, I research:\n\n1. Go to the Voice Library \"Explore\" tab\n2. Search keywords for your intended niche (e.g., \"meditation,\" \"podcast,\" \"narration\")\n3. Look at the top-performing voices\n4. Study their names, descriptions, tags, and previews\n5. Note what they're doing well\n\nAsk yourself:\n\n* What keywords are they using?\n* How do they describe the voice?\n* What does their preview say/do?\n* Is this niche saturated or underserved?\n\nThen create a voice that fits the proven formula while adding your own twist. Don't copy, but definitely learn from winners.\n\n**Optimize Everything**\n\n* **Tags matter.** Use all the relevant ones. Think about what users would search.\n* **Description matters.** Be specific and benefit-focused.\n* **Preview matters.** Make those 150 characters count.\n* **Voice quality matters.** Better recordings = better clones = more usage.\n\n---\n\n## Realistic Expectations\n\nLet me be honest about what to expect:\n\n**Month 1:** You'll probably make somewhere between $10-50. Don't be discouraged. The algorithm needs time to surface your voice to users.\n\n**Months 2-3:** If your voice is decent and well-tagged, you should see growth. $50-150/month is reasonable.\n\n**Months 4+:** Things stabilize. You'll have a sense of whether a voice is a winner or underperformer.\n\n**My portfolio breakdown:**\n\n| Tier | Voices | Avg Monthly | % of Revenue |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Top performer (&gt;$250/mo) | 1 | $309 | 27% |\n| Strong ($100-150/mo) | 3 | $111 | 36% |\n| Moderate ($50-100/mo) | 1 | ~$100 | 9% |\n| Underperforming (&lt;$50/mo) | 1 | $16 | 1% |\n| Too new to judge | 2 | TBD | - |\n\nNot every voice will be a home run. That's fine. The portfolio approach smooths out the variance.\n\n---\n\n## Common Questions\n\n**Do I need professional audio experience?**\n\nNo. I have it, and it helps, but I've seen people with basic setups do well. Clean audio in a quiet room matters more than expensive gear.\n\n**How much time does this take?**\n\nUpfront: Maybe 2-5 hours per voice (recording, editing, uploading, optimizing). Ongoing: Almost none. I check my stats (and bank account) every few weeks. It's genuinely passive.\n\n**Is the market saturated?**\n\nThere are a lot of voices, but demand is growing fast. The key is finding your niche. Generic \"male narrator\" is crowded. \"Soothing meditation guide\" or \"energetic Gen-Z explainer\" is less so.\n\n**Can I do this outside the US?**\n\nYes! ElevenLabs pays creators worldwide via Stripe. Tax implications vary by country, so check your local laws.\n\n**What if my voice gets rejected?**\n\nMake sure your audio quality is good and your verification matches your uploaded content. I've never had a rejection, so I can't speak to the appeals process.\n\n---\n\n## Quick-Start Checklist\n\nIf you want to get started today:\n\n* Sign up for ElevenLabs Creator Plan\n* Set up your recording space (quiet room, mic, software)\n* Record 30-45 minutes of audio (match your intended use case)\n* Edit lightly (remove mistakes, normalize levels)\n* Create Professional Voice Clone\n* Pass verification (same setup as recording!)\n* Generate preview (max 150 characters)\n* Publish to Voice Library\n* Set up Stripe payouts\n* Repeat with new voices to build portfolio\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThis isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. It took me 13 months to get to $1,160/month, and I put real effort into building and optimizing my portfolio.\n\nBut here's what I love about it:\n\n* **It's genuinely passive.** I haven't touched most of my voices in months.\n* **It scales.** More voices means more income streams.\n* **Low startup cost.** $11 for your first month, basic mic, free software.\n* **Growing market.** AI voice usage is exploding.\n\n**Ready to start building your voice portfolio?** Here's my affiliate link: [https://try.elevenlabs.io/earn-with-voice-clones](https://try.elevenlabs.io/earn-with-voice-clones)\n\nYou get 50% off your first month and everything I learned in 13 months about turning this into $1k+/month. I get a small referral bonus. We all win. Seriously, good luck. Drop questions in the comments if you get stuck. I'll try to answer as many as I can.\n\nNow go make some money! 🎤\n\n---\n\n**EDIT (Day 4):**\n\nThis got way more attention than I expected, so here's some additional context that might help:\n\nThe PDF I linked includes actual screenshots—my ElevenLabs dashboard with earnings by voice, plus Stripe payout history. Probably should've made that clearer upfront. Click the link and scroll down to the Appendix (page 4) for screenshots of my actual earnings.\n\n[Report and Payout Screenshots Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QpjMjdh4MU4vIadC6ZjSYqKWwhF4Puf2/view?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm also not the only one doing this. u/liam_in_a_bubble mentioned in the comments they've made over $2k from a single voice. The opportunity is real.\n\nI uploaded two new voices this week. Within a few days, they've each made around $15, already covering the subscription cost. I'll post screenshots once they get their first payouts.\n\nA few people asked about voice ownership: You retain rights to your voice and can remove it anytime with the notice period you set. I've read through the TOS and feel good about it, but worth reviewing yourself before diving in.\n\nQuick update: 21 people have signed up through my link so far. Good for you! If any of you are working through the setup and get stuck, especially on verification or keywords, drop a comment. Happy to help.",

          "body": "Solid write-up overall very thorough 👍  \nA couple things that might help people not overthink it:  \nThe barrier to entry is still low. A couple hundred bucks a month is very doable *right now*, even without pro audio experience. That said, more people are catching on, so this probably won’t be wide open forever.  \nPeople tend to overcomplicate the setup. At its core it’s really just:\n\n1. Sign up for [Elevenlabs](https://share.google/YX0r067VkJEGa0KHz)\n2. Choose the Creator Plan\n3. Upload a clean voice sample (30 mins minimum — honestly 2–3 hours is even better)\n4. Pass the voice captcha (verification)\n5. Toggle Shared + Discovery in Voice Library\n6. Wait \\~1–2 days for approval\n\nYou’re basically licensing your voice like a voice actor. Users grab your voice for audiobooks, YouTube shorts, explainers, etc., and you get paid every time it’s used. No outreach, no client management.  \nCharacterization matters more than people realize. Slight pitch, pacing, or energy changes can make the same voice feel totally different  and those variations often perform better than a generic “narrator” voice.\n\nAlso appreciate you being upfront about expectations and portfolio strategy that’s where most people go wrong thinking one voice is enough for $1000/month.",

So I would never suggest Etsy. It's also fickle, so I'd be in trouble if I depended on that alone. I have a 9-5 that is dependable. \n\nMy point is an actual job is going to make you income to support yourself while you find a side hustle to begin. Most side hustles are on the side because they don't give real pay the rent/mortgage type money. And all of them take a bit of time to develop.\n\nMy 'side hustles' that are fairly passive are things like Fetch Rewards and Evidation where you get points to exchange for gift cards. It isn't quick or steady money. \n\nThat's the biggest trouble with side hustles or working in ecommerce, you never know how much you will earn at any given time. It depends on trends, economy, how you present yourself/product, and how big of a social media following you can gain. \n\nI only mention all this because if you need the money to pay your bills, this isn't something to start now.",

Affiliate marketing is one, no inventory, low startup, but it does take learning and patience. Pinterest works especially well because content can drive traffic for months instead of days.\n\nDigital products are another good route if you have any knowledge or experience you can package into templates, guides, or simple resources. You create it once and sell it repeatedly.\n\nIf income is urgent, pairing something faster (freelance, VA work, local services) with a longer-term online strategy can take pressure off! \n\nWhatever you choose, I’d avoid anything promising “quick passive income.” The legit stuff usually takes effort upfront, but it does compound over time.\nAlways open to chat more!",

I have a family friend who rents out enormous cooking pots to members of his community to cater weddings and celebrations. Commercial rental companies don’t stock the style of pots needed by his community, and they can’t guarantee that their equipment has only been used to prepare specific types of food. He runs the business out of his garage and it’s about as close to passive as you can get (ie customers pick up and drop off, pay online).",

What income streams were worth the initial investment of time or money? Which ones ended up being more active than expected?  \n  \nI’m open to things like online businesses, digital products, investing, or other side hustles that can coexist with full-time work. If you’re willing to share, I’d appreciate details like how long it took to see results, how much ongoing maintenance is required, and any common mistakes beginners should avoid.",

          "body": "I'm in a similar boat, full-time job but I've managed to build up a few income streams on the side.  \nMy main passive income comes from dividend investing. I've been consistently putting money into dividend-paying stocks and ETFs over the past few years, and now I'm at the point where I'm getting a few hundred dollars quarterly without doing anything. The key was starting early and being consistent with contributions, even if they were small at first. It took about 2-3 years before it felt \"real,\" but now it genuinely requires zero maintenance beyond occasional portfolio rebalancing.\n\nFor semi-passive stuff, I also do side hustles when I have free time. I use Freecash to pick up some extra money during lunch breaks or when I'm watching TV. It's not life-changing money, but it's nice beer money for tasks that take minimal effort. The beauty of it is I can do it whenever I want, no commitment.\n\nMy advice: Start with something that requires minimal ongoing decisions (like index fund investing) and layer on active side hustles as your schedule allows. The combination has worked well for me because the passive stuff grows in the background while I can scale the active stuff up or down based on how busy work gets.  \nHappy to answer any questions if you want more details!",

It’s not exciting, but it’s predictable, and a lot of it turns into recurring work with the same clients.\n\nOver time, that’s what gave me leverage and optionality.

          "body": "Honestly you already have the right mindset. Most so called passive income takes real upfront effort and only becomes more hands off later if you stick with it long enough.\n\nI work with a financial services firm called Revolution Financial Management and what I have seen work best for people with full time jobs is treating something new as a parallel build rather than expecting quick passive results. It is not instant and it is not hands off in the beginning, but it can realistically scale over time and become more flexible once systems and clients are in place.\n\nWhat tends to work well is starting it alongside a normal nine to five, setting clear boundaries on time, and letting it grow gradually instead of forcing it to replace income too quickly. Some people keep it supplemental long term and others eventually lean into it more once it proves itself.\n\nIt may be worth exploring alongside things like investing or digital products if your goal is something that can coexist with full time work and potentially become more hands off later. Happy to explain what it actually looks like in practice if you are curious. No pressure at all.",

Like templates, guides, or tools for a specific niche. Takes months upfront but then it just sits there and sells occasionally.\n\nDividend investing is passive but you need capital and the returns are slow unless you're putting in thousands.\n\nFor me personally, I make around $300 from survey stuff monthly but that's not really passive, just low effort during downtime.

Game changer was looking at what people searched for on Etsy and Pinterest.\n\nWhat worked:\n\nBundles sell way better than single products. A $27 bundle moves faster than a $7 template even though they take the same time to make.\n\nEtsy SEO isn’t optional. Boring but necessary if you want to be found.\n\nQuality over quantity. 10 good products beat 50 mediocre ones.\n\nWhat didn’t work:\n\nPinterest ads (wasted $200), daily Instagram posting (low conversions), lowering prices (attracts problem customers).\n\nNovember breakdown: $1,840 Etsy, $780 Gumroad, $420 Creative Market.\n\nStill takes about 10 hours a week for customer service and new uploads. Not truly passive but beats a 9-5.\n\n​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

But I’m trying to look at it from a user’s perspective. Do people actually go to Gumroad and search for things, or is it mostly your job as the creator to bring in the traffic?\n\nI’m not saying this to be lazy I’m just genuinely curious.

They’ve paid out $500k to creators in the last 6 months.\n\nThe process is pretty simple:\n\nYou pick a video task (UGC or Paid Ad).\nFollow their script and filming guide.\nGet a base rate immediately once it's approved + u can also get performance based pay. So I thought it could be a good passive income. \n\nMy question is: they mentioned they can coach you, so do you think I can actually become a good creator starting with this? Has anyone tried their \"coaching\" or the new platform yet?\n\nFor those who want to register to the same program: \n\nhttps://bounty.app?fpr=admin",

Grow socials\n2. Sell prints\n3. Sell keychains, badges, and accessories\n4. Start boothing\n\nCVU03's suggestion is really good and what we're planning on doing as well.\n\nTwo years ago we did a test run with some prints and they sold out, so we definitely have some positive market signals.

It’s a skill.\n\nA lot of people jump into affiliate marketing thinking it’s just dropping links and waiting to get paid. That’s not how it works.\n\nAffiliate marketing is simple:\n\nYou recommend something. Someone buys. You earn a commission.\n\nThe hard part? Getting the right people to see it.\n\nMost beginners fail because they focus on links instead of learning how to attract attention, explain value, and build trust. Random links in random places don’t convert.\n\nYou don’t need a big following or fancy tools. You do need consistency, patience, and a willingness to learn what actually works.\n\nIt’s remote-friendly, beginner-friendly, and legit, but it’s not passive in the beginning. Think effort first, results later.\n\nTreat it like a real skill, not a shortcut, and it can work.\n\nHope this helps someone avoid wasting time.",

          "body": "This is a really honest question, and it’s good you’re asking it *now* instead of blindly copying whatever’s trending.\n\nI’ll be straight with you, but gently. Most people talking about “digital products + affiliate income” online are either very early, very lucky, or leaving out a lot of context. Consistent income does exist, but it’s usually way smaller and slower at the beginning than TikTok or Twitter makes it look. Think months of nothing, then maybe a few hundred, then gradual growth if you don’t quit.\n\nWhere people get stuck is starting with *vibes* instead of value. “Personal growth, life, mindset” sounds nice, but it’s incredibly hard to monetize unless you already have lived experience people trust or a very specific angle. At 20, that doesn’t mean you can’t do it, but it does mean you’ll need patience and humility. Most people don’t follow accounts for motivation, they follow because something consistently helps them think or act differently.\n\nA better way to think about starting is: who do I want to help, and with what very specific problem? Content works best when it’s tied to something practical, even if it’s small. Studying better, learning a skill faster, navigating early career mistakes, building discipline, saving money, learning a tool. Clarity beats inspiration every time.\n\nMonetization usually comes later and more indirectly than people admit. Affiliates work when you’re already using and recommending tools naturally. Digital products work when you’ve solved a problem enough times that packaging the solution makes sense. Most people don’t “decide” to monetize — it happens because people start asking for more.\n\nAt your age, the biggest win isn’t quick side income, it’s building skills and credibility in public. Content can be part of that, but it shouldn’t be the whole plan. Learn something real, document the process honestly, help others who are one or two steps behind you. That compounds way better than chasing funnels and links.\n\nIf you start with curiosity, consistency, and actually being useful, money becomes a byproduct. If you start with money as the main goal, burnout usually shows up first. You’re early. That’s an advantage, not a disadvantage.",

          "body": "I didn’t start with content creation or personal growth. I started with high intent audiences. In the UK I noticed soccer tipsters running £10 to £1,000 challenges and daily picks on Facebook and Twitter. Every post had hundreds of people emotionally invested in the next bet. These people already had bookmaker accounts and were actively trying to make money.\n\nInstead of competing with tipsters, I targeted their audience. I explained, using basic maths, why long term tipping is mathematically impossible for most people. I shared expected value, variance, and why chasing picks fails. I also drip fed examples of value betting where odds were longer than the implied probability, which built credibility fast.\n\nOnce people trusted the logic, I introduced matched betting as a risk free way to convert bookmaker bonuses into cash. Because the audience was already high intent, conversions were strong. Even after 9 years, my conversion rate has never dropped below 20%.\n\nA few years later I immigrated to the east coast of the US. By then I had long standing affiliate relationships with UK brands, and when those operators launched in the US , the partnerships carried over. The same model worked even better in the US because incentives were larger and the concept was brand new to the market, only available since 2018. \n\nToday it’s essentially passive. The content runs itself, the funnels are mature, and I don’t actively sell. I even have a QR code magnet on my truck that links to a simple explainer with my affiliate tracking embedded. It still converts because it meets people at the right moment with the right message.",

      "selftext": "\n\nNot a huge number compared to some posts here, but it’s a personal milestone so I wanted to share what actually worked.\n\nI started about 8 months ago after losing my job. I sell Canva and Notion templates on Etsy, Gumroad and on my website bought via a [portal](https://sitefy.co/product/digital-products-website-to-sell-digital-downloads-online/).\n\nThe first 3 months were rough. I made around $400 total. Biggest mistake was creating things I liked instead of what people were actively searching for. Things changed once I started researching Etsy search terms and Pinterest trends.\n\nWhat worked:\n\n• Bundles sell much better than single products. A $27 bundle moves faster than a $7 template, even though both take similar effort.\n• Etsy SEO is not optional. It’s boring, but it’s the difference between zero views and consistent sales.\n• Quality over quantity. 10 solid products outperform 50 average ones.\n\nWhat didn’t work:\n\n• Pinterest ads. Lost about $200 with almost no return.\n• Daily Instagram posting. Lots of effort, very low conversions.\n• Lowering prices. It didn’t increase volume and just brought more support issues.\n\nNovember breakdown:\n• Etsy: $678\n• Gumroad: 228$\n• Creative Market: $42\n\nI still spend around 10 hours a week on customer support and uploading new products, so it’s not truly passive. But it beats going back to a 9–5.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone’s curious.",

This is my third site but the first where I'm seriously experimenting with social media as a traffic/authority driver alongside traditional SEO.\n\n\n\nWanted to share what I've learned so far about using social signals to help a new site gain traction faster.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The theory I'm testing:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nGoogle's helpful content update seemed to emphasize \"real\" sites with actual audiences vs pure SEO plays. My hypothesis: if I can build genuine social engagement around my content, it might send positive signals that help with indexing and initial rankings.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What I set up:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Created accounts on IG, TikTok, Pinterest, and YouTube Shorts\n\n\\- Each piece of content I publish gets repurposed into short-form social content\n\n\\- Goal: drive some initial traffic + build \"brand signals\" that Google might pick up\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The problem I ran into:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nStarting from zero followers on every platform meant my content was basically invisible. Even good stuff got like 50 views max. The chicken-and-egg problem is real.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What I tried:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Pure organic grinding\\*\\* (first 6 weeks): Posted consistently, engaged with others, used trending sounds/hashtags. Result: painfully slow. Got to maybe 200 followers across all platforms.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Engagement pods\\*\\* (weeks 7-8): Joined a few Discord groups for mutual engagement. Result: felt fake, took way too much time, and the engagement didn't seem to help reach.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Small paid boosts\\*\\* (weeks 9-12): Used a combination of platform ads and an SMM service (Crescitaly - it's an Italian panel that delivers pretty realistic-looking engagement). I'd give new posts a small push of 100-200 likes/views to help them get initial traction.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Results so far (Month 4):\\*\\*\n\n\n\n| Metric | Month 1 | Month 4 |\n\n|--------|---------|----------|\n\n| Social followers (total) | 200 | 2,400 |\n\n| Monthly social referral traffic | \\~50 | \\~800 |\n\n| Indexed pages | 8 | 34 |\n\n| Organic traffic | 0 | \\~150/day |\n\n| DR (Ahrefs) | 0 | 8 |\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What I think is happening:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nThe social traffic, even though it's small, seems to be sending positive signals. Pages that get social shares tend to get indexed faster. I also noticed a few natural backlinks coming from people who found my content through social.\n\n\n\nThe SMM boosts didn't directly help SEO (obviously), but they helped my social content get seen by real people who then engaged organically. It's like using a small paid push to unlock organic distribution.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What flopped:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Pinterest: Took way more effort than expected for minimal return\n\n\\- Trying to grow all platforms equally: Should have focused on 1-2\n\n\\- Over-boosting: When I tried larger boosts (500+ likes), the engagement looked suspicious and didn't convert to real followers\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Questions for the community:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. Anyone else experimenting with social as part of their niche site strategy? What's working for you?\n\n\n\n2. Do you think Google actually factors in social signals, or am I just getting lucky with timing?\n\n\n\n3. For those further along: did early social investment pay off long-term, or is it just a distraction from content/links?\n\n\n\n4. Is there an ethical line with using paid boosts to kickstart social? I go back and forth on this.\n\n\n\nHappy to share more details if anyone's interested. Still very much learning but wanted to document the journey.",

      "selftext": "I run a small online plant shop, mostly succulents and stuff for apartments. Been doing it for about 2 years, decent side income that turned into my main thing last year. Anyway, back in September this lady emails me asking if I could take her dead plants and turn them into some kind of preserved art piece for her wall. Like pressed flowers but for her crispy monstera that she killed. I honestly thought she was messing with me.\n\nBut she was dead serious (no pun intended) and offered to pay me $80 for it. I was like whatever, why not, had some saved money from Stаke set aside for random experiments anyway. Took me maybe 3 hours total including the framing. Posted a pic of the final thing on instagram just cause it looked pretty cool, got way more engagement than my usual posts.\n\nNext thing I know I'm getting like 15 DMs a week from people wanting the same thing. Turns out theres this whole guilt thing with plants where people feel bad throwing them away and want to \"honor\" them or whatever. Some interior designers started reaching out too because apparently dead plant art is having a moment??\n\nNow Im doing 20 to 30 of these a month at $95 each and honestly the margins are insane compared to selling live plants. No shipping stress, no dealing with weather delays killing inventory, and people are way less picky than with living plants. The community around it is also super engaged which helps with word of mouth.\n\nI still sell regular plants but this accidental thing is now my main income source and I barely advertised it. Just goes to show sometimes the dumbest sounding ideas are worth testing out.",

We had some old windows the glass had been take out of and never really did much with them, so she cleaned them up and spray painted one side black and let it dry. Then she would find the perfect web and spray it gently with white, and before it could dry she would \"walk\" through the web with the black sheet of glass so the wet paint would firmly apply the web to the glass. She let it dry and then put the top piece of glass on and it was done except for the frame. She did one huge web on a large piece that came out almost perfect and sold it for $3,000.",

Live plants have spoilage, shipping risk, seasonal demand, and customers get upset when things die. Dead plant art has none of that. You're basically selling preserved inventory with unlimited shelf life.\n\nAlso \"dead plant art is having a moment\" is the most 2024 sentence I've read in a while. But honestly it makes sense - people spend money on house plants because they want the aesthetic, not because they love caring for living things. You're selling the aesthetic without the maintenance burden.\n\nCurious how you handle the sourcing - are these all customer plants or do you ever buy \"dead stock\" from nurseries? Feel like there might be an angle there if nurseries are throwing away inventory anyway.",

      "selftext": "Started flipping luxury watches about a year and half ago. I started with 25k of my own capital from my day job. Eventually I put in up to about \\~70k of my own funds (owners capital) to grow the business. I started with no funding, no mentor, no one in the business and no courses. Lost 2k on my first 2 watches in 2024. Lost another 8k later that year. I mostly sell Rolexes and luxury brands. Nothing under 1k. Average watch price is around 10k.\n\n2024 - First 6 months:\n\n\\- 561k in sales\n\n\\- 22k gross profit\n\n\\- 13k net profit\n\n2025 - One year:\n\n\\- 1.2m in sales\n\n\\- 87k gross profit\n\n\\- 63k net profit\n\n\\- \\~8k payroll (salary to myself)\n\nIve been wholesaling pretty much everything. Fast flips. I aim for 6-12% margins, depending on how long I’m holding a watch. I’ve lost a few times, can count on one hand probably. I’m trying to get to a point where I’m making a consistent 10k / month net, after all expenses including my salary of 1k / month.\n\nI do some social media / marketing but very little. Trying to really focus on that this year so I can sell to more retail clients for a healthier margin. As well as buy more watches from retail clients.\n\nIt’s been really fun and I love watches and enjoy getting to wear them while I try to sell them. I still have my day job and don’t think I’m going to quit anytime soon.\n\nJust wanted to share this. If I missed anything or any questions just ask below. I’m going to try to post regular updates to track my progress and engage with others as I have never done it before. \n\nThanks!",

It can always work better faster, harder later.\n\nI stocked up a war chest for almost nine years.In my business. I just mastered the mundane and kept doing what was working.And didn't get fancy.\n\nWhen the new trump trade war started, I was able to drop a massive amount of capital on massive amount of inventory and avoid our tariffs jumping from the 25% we had been paying since 2018, to 100-150%.\n\nThis allowed us to keep our pricing the same. Last year, one of the other two manufacturers that supply our niche of commercial truck parts globally was absorbed by the other. Both were already 50% more expensive than we are, even though we have twice the profit margins. Once they completed the buyout, the company raised its prices another thirty to forty five percent!\n\nWe gained 127 new customers the first month after the buyout. For the last three months, we have seen double digit new customers coming on board. \n\nThe company that bought our other competitor is bleeding customers for this niche every day.\n\nWe recouped every dollar that we spent though.We did burn through what was supposed to be 24 months of inventory in just over 12. We have the cash flow, though, and we've already got 2 more inventory orders on the water that should arrive any day. Today I had five new customers.Come on board that were bleeding off of the competitor. \n\nWe did our first price increase in ten years on january first for 7%. We still dominate our market in pricing. And quality, and we still have almost 80% net profit margins with the new inventory lines coming in.\n\nI'd like biographies. Founder's Podcast is excellent. Many of the old business greats I had one thing in common.And that is, they sat on a mountain of cash.",

The tension between scaling and safety is real though.\n\n\n\nOne thing that helped businesses I know navigate this: automating the processes BEFORE scaling. If you automate your core workflows now, you can actually scale revenue without proportionally scaling headcount or risk.\n\n\n\nThink about it - if you can automate 30-50% of your operational overhead, you can take on 50% more volume without hiring, which means less fixed costs and lower risk while still growing.\n\n\n\nBefore you and your cofounder compromise on strategy, map out which parts of your operation could be automated. That usually gives you a third option: scale with existing team + automation. Gives you growth without the risk exposure you're worried about.\n\n\n\nJust a thought, but it's honestly how a lot of profitable businesses approach scaling without burning cash.",

      "selftext": "I've hired 6 devs over the past 4 years. Two were great while the others cost me a lot of money before i figured out they weren't working out.\n\nThe problem? I couldn't tell who was good until months of cash had already burned.\n\nhere is what i wish i knew earlier:\n\n**Too much jargon is a red flag.**\n\nGood developers explain their work simply. \"I added the password reset button. Now users get an email when they click it.\" While bad developers hide behind complexity. \"I refactored the auth middleware to handle session state.\"\n\nIf your dev leaves you more confused at the end of the conversation, that's not because you're dumb. It's because they're either hiding something or they don't truly understand what they built\n\n**Commit frequency matters even if you can't read code.**\n\nGo to your repo on GitHub. You don't need to understand the code. Just look at the patterns.\n\nIf you see multiple commits per week with clear messages like \"feat: added user profile page\" then that's good, while one giant commit every 10 days labeled \"updates\" or \"fixes\" is bad .\n\nKeep this as a rule of thumb: Small frequent commits = good habits. One giant weekly commit = poor planning or last-minute cramming.\n\n**\"Almost done\" is almost always a lie.**\n\nIf your dev always answers to your queries about what happened with : \"almost done\". they're either stuck and won't admit it, or they're actually not working.\n\nGood devs give specifics: \"password reset is done. email templates will be done in Thursday. Then I'll use two days to test.\"\n\n**The best developers push back on your ideas.**\n\nThis always keep surprising me. The devs who keep saying yes to every request are actually the worst. They weren't thinking, just billing\n\nThe best developer I ever hired regularly told me my ideas were wrong. \"That feature would take 6 weeks. What if we did this simpler version instead?\"\n\nThat's what you want. You don't want a mindless machine, but someone that will help you and correct you if you're wrong.\n\n**Weekly demos reveal everything.**\n\nStop accepting status updates. Ask your dev every Friday for a working demo of what he is working on. Even if it is still unfinished.\n\nGood developers love showing their work, but the bad ones always have an excuse for why they can't demo yet.\n\nBy the time your gut tells you something is wrong. You've already lost months.  \nWhat i found the most helpful is getting visibility earlier not until it's obvious\n\nWhat signals do you look for when evaluating developers? Curious what's worked for others here.",

          "body": "I know it's hard, or even seems impossible and pointless. I've been there, still there in a way. Put it to the side for now. There is no rush or time table on whatever you are working on... Just do what you can when you need the distraction. Don't do anything that will require your time, unless you need the distraction, or are sure you unable to be spending it with your loved one. I will share some of my story. I don't know if it will help or not, as I'm still not sure how it turns out....\n\nI quit my job (6-figures) last February to move 200 miles back to my hometown to take care of my father. He was  having a hard time and seemed to be going through early stages of dementia. My Dad in the 8 months before that lost his brother, his wife (step-mom) and his sister. He was best friends with his brother, extremely close to his sister, and married to his wife for over 40 years. The year before we lost his father and the year before that his mother. The lost seemed to take a piece of my Dad's mind each time. But I was just far enough a way to not see it... I talked to him 4 or 5 times a week but he was always according to him doing good. \nMy Dad and I have always been really close and if you ask him, his whole life he was always good, or fine. By the time I got here I instantly knew he wasn't good. It took a few months to find out he had stage 4 lung cancer, that had traveled to his brain, and bones. My Dad who was never sick, never had a surgery, or illness, and was the rock in my life. He was a good man, that was always smiling, and really cared for everyone he ever met. I only saw him mad a few times in my life, and never sad except when we lost loved ones.\nI dropped everything in my life the day he called me to ask if I had talked to his sister, my aunt.. who we lost 6 months before. I literally quit my job as a Program Manager at a Fortune 100 company, packed a suitcase, and drove the 200 miles to his house. I gave everything else I owned away to family and my wife of 30 years that I had recwbtly seperated from. \n\nI came here and since that day I took him to every appointment and treatment, watched him waste away all the way down to 85 lbs after the radiation treatments, cooked his meals 3 times a day that he just couldn't eat eventually, carried him to the bathroom, bathed him, and held his hand when he took his last breath on December 13th 2025. By then I was struggling to feed myself and keep the lights on. I scrapped up just enough to pay for the funeral. Now I have to be out of his home by February 1st and not sure what I'm going to do... probanly sleep in my car. Idk... \nWhatever happens I'm thankful for the time I had.. I'm haunted by it as well. He was who I talked to whenever anything happened in my life. I sometimes would put off something or whatever it was for days before talking to him, because I knew he would tell me the right thing to do.. and that was usually the hard thing I was avoiding. But that was the kind of person he was. He was good. In the 10 months we probably had 5 or 6 people stop by... He didn't want others to know or worry about him.. ever. But over 100 people showed up at his funeral. Many I didn't know. He was truly a great man, quiet, good looking, funny, talented, humble... and really so talented... as an artist, a musician, and really everything, he could literally do everything. The man was amazing and just so so humble. A professional musician his whole life. He could play any instrument since he was 6 years old. Didnt read music, you could just turn on the radio, hand him any instrument and he would start playing along with whatever was playing. He was a studio musician and recorded for a ton of names everyone would know. He was flawless thats why they hired him when making the final cut of a song or album. He also was a  business owner, and so much more. He was just good and I know I'm blessed to have had him as a father.  Sorry for going on. \nI'm still lost, I don't know how to deal with it or anything anymore. \n\nBut if you take anything away from my ramblings, just be thankful for whatever time you have left. Spend as much time as possible with your loved one. Ask them questions, make them tell you all their stories, experience anything they are still able to do... bring your laptop. There will be plenty of time between those moments to turn your mind to websites and whatever just to distract yourself from the doctor's office, or hospital room, or the nap they are taking. That's all I have. I will pray for you and your family. If you want to talk or need someone just to listen, im available.",

What value do you bring to the owners that supports that level of investment on their part?  (I don’t mean that in a snarky way).  For instance, if I gave you 10 houses to manage, under the math, I would need to pay you approximately $400,000 a year.  [$5M/130= $38,500 per house, per year].  Seems like for that amount of money I could find somebody who would gladly do it at a quarter of the cost, because managing 10 houses is not that challenging.",

Less day-to-day stress? Financial security? The answer changes depending on that.\n\nFor me, I sold because I was tired and $180K was life-changing money at the time.

Unless they're offering like 5-7x earnings, you might make more just keeping it and hiring a GM to run day-to-day.\n\nAlso exits sound great until you realize you just sold the thing you built.

It could be a larger property management company writes you a big check and you walk away immediately or in the very short term.  It could be a private equity leveraged buyout where you get a decent sized check but still own some of the company and work with your new lords and masters toward some bigger multi-year goals and a second payoff down the the road.  It could be a large corporate entity where you get a big check and become a middle manager employee doing essentially the same job you've been doing but now for a salary+bonus structure (contract or at will) under the umbrella of the corporation.\n\nI would start by asking one or more of those who have approached you.  Pick one who is actually in your business, not a broker or middleman type, and just have a chit chat about it.  But certainly don't just dance with one fella.  If you decide to get serious about working a deal, engage experienced help such as brokers and lawyers.  Cast a wide net and find the right deal for you.  I don't like to pay big bucks to brokers and lawyers any more than the next guy, but this is an area where professional help is a must.  These deals can get complicated and go wrong in unexpected ways, not something to be taken lightly.",

Endless liability and requirements. Truly insane being forced to honour “verbal contracts” aka conversations during reviews where nothing was promised other than a review of circumstances and a decision back turning into arbitration situations that wasted tons of time and money despite being provably in the right. Thank god for diligence in writing meeting memos and circulating those for approval and comment \n- Complete inability to separate my life and create space. It’s all encompassing.

Even a warm phone call, a personal visit, shared routines become the memories that actually last.  \nChasing success for them is beautiful, but don't turn love into a deadline. if they raise someone this driven and this caring, you have already given them proof they disn't fail.\n\nI was in similar boat a while ago, but my oldman gave this advice, and my wife validated the same, now we are in happy space.",

      "selftext": "When I started my company, I was naive.\n\nI thought success and money would come fast.  \nSix months. Maybe a year.\n\nI believed that if the idea was good and I worked hard enough, things would line up.  \nThat investors were out there, waiting for founders like me to show up with the right story.\n\nThat belief didn’t come from nowhere.  \nSocial media makes entrepreneurship look fast, obvious, and rewarding, especially if you are willing to sacrifice a bit.\n\nReality was very different.\n\nEarly on, I met an entrepreneur who had been through a divorce.  \nI asked him about his journey and about the divorce.\n\nHe told me something simple:\n\n“Everything has a price.  \nIf you are not willing to pay it, you don’t get the reward.”\n\nAt the time, I understood the words.  \nI didn’t understand the depth.\n\nWhat I know now is that entrepreneurship doesn’t just test your skills.  \nIt tests how much uncertainty you can live with, and for how long, without breaking.\n\nIt’s lonely.  \nNot in a dramatic way.  \nIn a quiet, repetitive way.\n\nThere are very few celebrations.  \nJust an endless stream of decisions, doubts, and problems to solve.  \nEvery day.\n\nYou lose people along the way.\n\nNot because you become arrogant.  \nNot because you “don’t care anymore.”  \nBut because you stop building an acceptable life, one where responsibility is shared, and move toward a life where outcomes fall largely on you.\n\nYou stop drifting.  \nYou take control.  \nAnd once you do, there’s no one left to blame.\n\nThat mindset doesn’t stay at work.\n\nIt changes how you see relationships.  \nTime.  \nCompromise.  \nRisk.\n\nYou start operating with a level of intensity and accountability that not everyone around you wants or can follow.\n\nIn my case, this contributed to my divorce.  \nI couldn’t stay in a relationship that no longer worked for either of us.  \nThat choice came with real loneliness.\n\nI also used to believe entrepreneurship was about eventually sharing success with your family.  \nMore freedom.  \nMore time.  \nMore presence.\n\nWhat I didn’t anticipate is that the transition itself is costly.\n\nYou lose time before you gain any.  \nYou are less present than you’d like.  \nAnd the emotional margin shrinks long before the rewards show up.\n\nThere is something important I wish I had understood earlier.\n\nEntrepreneurship is not just hard.  \nIt is hard in a very specific way.\n\nIf you struggle with prolonged uncertainty,  \nif you need frequent reassurance,  \nif financial stress or ambiguity quickly destabilize you,  \nthis path can slowly erode you.\n\nNot because you are weak.  \nBut because not everyone is wired to operate for long periods without feedback, validation, or safety nets.\n\nAnd that is okay.\n\nThere is no shame in choosing stability.  \nIn preferring predictable income.  \nIn building a life with more emotional space.\n\nEntrepreneurship isn’t better.  \nIt isn’t braver.  \nIt is simply a different set of trade offs, and a very expensive one psychologically.\n\nI am not sharing this to complain or to glorify suffering.  \nI chose this path, and I still do.\n\nBut if you are considering it, be honest with yourself about the price.  \nAnd if you are already on it and feeling this weight,\n\nyou are not broken.\n\nYou are experiencing what this path actually demands.",

When I was in my early thirties, I almost gave up and chose stability. Find a large growing family and my wife wasn't on the same page with my long-term goals, and who I was as a person. After fifteen years it led to our divorce.\n\nAt absolute rock bottom in December 2016 I went out one New Years eve, broken, and ready for the end. I met my now wife that night just before midnight. We spent three and a half days talking. She told me to kick off bottom.She saw who I was deep down.\n\nIt made all the difference in the world. I thought maybe...\n\n2017 I started my business with literally nothing but my skills, knowledge, and enough spark to kick hard off bottom. I'd built companies over and over again that were very successful for the people that i've worked for over the years. I knew what to do, and I had a new energy to do it. I had nothing to lose and I had everything to lose.\n\nLooking back, I did believe within that first year we would break seven figures easily. We had a commercial truck part that had never been manufactured overseas. We chose higher grade materials, and we modified the designs to make installation a fraction of the time. I set the price at 50%-60% less than anyone else in the market. I made a 150-200 cold calls everyday except some Sundays for many many years consistently.\n\nLike you I slowly realized that it was definitely going to be a much longer journey. Those first four years we ate at food banks more than we ate at grocery stores. Well, at least my wife and I did. We let the kids eat the good stuff and they never knew.\n\nThe divorce dragged on for 6 long years. I changed my goal to wanting. Fuck you money so I could get better lawyers, specialists, and private detectives. I lost 2 daughters in that season and a son whom I was eventually able to find and reconnect with. I gained three amazing stepchildren. Lost a few people to covid. Almost lost the home five different times. Eventually, choosing to sell it, and buying an r v to live in. Cut all holidays and birthdays down to homemade gifts. Downsize everything out of our lives. Ran up hundreds of thousands in lawyer debts. \n\nThe struggles were what motivated me to work through it though. I couldn't sleep. I knew my kids were out there somewhere alive. A human is not built to successfully grieve a child that is missing but still alive.\n\nAfter my wife and kids were in bed, I would get out of bed and work until 2-4am at times. Not because I wanted to, but I couldn't sleep. Those days and weeks and months may have been what pushed us through those first four years. \n\nI wouldn't change any of it. We achieved the freedom of time, more control of our lives, touched countless lives with the resources we have built at the fuck you money stage. \n\nIt's not for everyone now.And that's okay. My biggest lesson that i've learned is you have to find bliss in the day to day.No matter what.",

If you want a slightly “faster” path to success, don’t go straight to building a business, build sales. Find your customer FIRST, with a sign up sheet and product mock ups. With cold calls or emails. With ads. Forget the overhead and LLC and all the irrelevant parts. Go straight to sales. Once you have proven that there are customers on the other side, ready, willing and able to pay for the product. Then, and only then, build a business. You should always be testing new business ideas by first trying to find a customer. And then building upon that. Thats how many greats who started on a shoestring budget, without investors, did it.

Maybe one of the most insightful and honest words about what it takes to be a real entrepreneur. What really hits home is:\n\n“Everything has a price.\nIf you are not willing to pay it, you don’t get the reward.”\n\nI started my first company as a spin off of another company that was sold. I had a partner who was the university-based founder of the first company. Plus, other key people from that company were investors in the spin off. I was CEO for 2 years and stepped back into a CTO role and my partner left the university to come on board as CEO. We raised over $70M, got in the pipeline to do an IPO, then 911 hit and the shit really hit fan. We ended up laying off 80% of our staff (many who were good friends).  We refocused on our core and took a few years to stabilize. We got new investors, my cofounder was pushed out, new management came in and the company was sold for 2-3 years later for $50M. I worked my ass off for 10+ years and only got about $300K out of the sale. I left shortly after, looked for job, couldn’t find one and decided to start a new company again.\n\nI moved with my wife and 12 year old son to a state where I didn’t know anyone. A fresh start. I licensed technology out of the local university and started a new company on my own. I did everything myself for a year and got some part time contractors to help (including key tech workers from the university). I got some early sales and had investors knocking on my door. I was trying to avoid taking any investor money, but I was burning thru my personal savings, so I decided to take on some investment. My goal was to raise as little as possible while getting sales. Ultimately ended of raising about $15M over an 8 years period and sold the company for nearly $100M. As the sole founder I did pretty well. \n\nAlong the way, I experienced many of the personal issues you mentioned. My wife left me because I just didn’t have time for her or my son. This still pains me nearly 20 years later. Eventually we reconciled and are doing well today, but the journey was extremely painful on a personal basis, but hugely rewarding from a business perspective.   I’ve been a board member, advisor, investor in a number of other startups and try to warn the founders of the personal pains they will experience, the commitment required, etc. Most just don’t make it, especially if they have something else they can fall back onto. \n\nBest of luck to you.",

So the real metric isnt time spent onboarding. \n\nIts time to first meaningful action. Shorten that and churn drops without touching the roadmap. Most founders over explain instead of over guiding.

Get feedback every step of the way.

I started working at different startups to learn more about the industry and ecosystem. After a good years of experience, I started working on my own startup. It’s been two years, I’ve gone through depression, anxiety, not having enough runway, running out of money, almost becoming homeless, suicidal thoughts, no personal life, investor rejections, tons of refining my idea, solution based on problem space. Even at the initial stage, my customers insulted me and told me to shut down the project because it was a waste of time, money and resources. Later, I did self validations, improved myself, my idea, solution and learned more about my customers.\n\nPlease share your dark experience of being as a founder.",

It’s not panic, it’s just always there in the background, especially once the initial excitement fades and progress slows.\n\nLearning to accept that risk without letting it turn into paralysis or reckless decisions has probably been the hardest part so far.",

Everyone tells you to work hard and that you have to grind because your competitors are grinding harder than you, but nobody ever talks about the importance of balance and not feeling guilty for not working hard all the time. I hope if any new founders are reading this, that you make it a focus to take care of yourself first and foremost, and never lose sight of what makes you happy, or your hobbies. The grind is not worth it, at least in my eyes. There are better ways to achieve your goals through a slow, methodical, and well thought out plan of attack. Many hours worked does not necessarily equate to many dollars earned. Life is so short, and work is far from the most important thing we can do with the little time that we have.",

Wouldn't people pay a premium for that? Or, extra virgin olive oil pressed by the monks living in a remote monastery in Southern Europe with a production capacity of a few hundred litres a year.

If I'm paying the same price as the big supermarkets and customer service is nothing special and the product is commoditised, I'd choose to spend my money with a company that invests in social good. Spend 1% of your revenue planting trees or installing solar panels or donate the money to funds fighting against big corporations exploiting animals/people/the planet.\n\n4. Underdog. As above.

      "selftext": "I've watched dozens of founders announce their fundraise over the past year. Most of them follow the same playbook: write a LinkedIn post, maybe a Twitter thread, attach some founder headshots, thank their investors, and call it a day.\n\nThey get 50 likes. Their investors comment. A few friends reshare. And then it's gone.\n\nMeanwhile, a handful of founders treat their fundraise like a marketing moment and the difference in outcomes is wild.\n\nWhy does this even matter?\n\nHere's what most founders don't realize: a fundraising announcement isn't just \"news.\" It's one of the only moments where you have a legitimate reason to be loud. You have something to say. People expect you to share it. And if you do it right, you're not just announcing money. You're doing three things at once:\n\n1. Building credibility. When your announcement gets traction, future investors see momentum. It makes the next round easier. The halo effect is real.\n2. Driving signups. A viral fundraising moment doesn't just impress VCs. It brings in users who were on the fence. People want to be part of something that's clearly working.\n3. Creating leverage. When everyone's talking about you, recruiting gets easier. Partnerships open up. Press reaches out. You're suddenly on people's radar.\n\nBest example I've seen: Arlan Rakhmetzhanov dropped a cinematic video recreating that famous scene from The Social Network. It hit 2-3 million views across LinkedIn and X. Investors reached out. Other founders started talking about him.\n\nThe money matters. But the attention you get for free might matter more.",

      "selftext": "I run a hardware studio here in India handling end-to-end OEM work. I want to be optimistic because I’ve bet my career on this, but we need to be honest about what’s actually happening on the ground.\nIf you believe the headlines, we are a superpower now. Electronics production hit $135B (₹11.3 lakh crore) last year, and we are the 2nd largest mobile manufacturer in the world. On paper, it looks like a revolution.\nBut in my studio, the reality feels different.\nThe issue is that while the \"Production\" numbers are up 6x, the local value add is stuck at like 15-20%. That means for every \"Made in India\" phone, ~85% of the value is still just imported parts that we screw together here.\nI dug into the trade data to see if I was just imagining it, and it’s actually getting worse in some areas:\nOur imports from China almost doubled between 2017 and 2024 (hit ~$129B).\nWe still rely on them for 94% of our Li-ion batteries and 88% of ICs.\nThe bottleneck isn't talent.\nThe issue I face daily is speed vs. compliance. If I’m in Shenzhen, I can get a complex PCB prototyped and assembled in 3 days. Here, I spend that same time just waiting for a specific sensor to clear customs or dealing with BIS certification paperwork.\nI’m trying to solve this for my clients by handling the end-to-end mess for them, but it’s an uphill battle.\nI’m curious to hear from other hardware founders here: What is the actual blocker for you?\nIs it that you literally can't source the components locally, or is it that the BIS/Customs headache just makes it not worth the effort compared to importing white-label stuff?",

We’ll both be turning 18 this year, and due to cultural pressure, she will most likely be getting forced into marriage after she turns 18.\n\nBut we want to break the chain. So even if our family tries to force us do something against our will, we can simply live separately by handling our own expenses.\n\nFor this reason I have entered entrepreneurship a little over a year ago, trying to build financial independence and I haven't been quite successful with it yet.\n\nMy gf can’t contribute directly because of cultural restrictions. After household chores, she barely even gets time to study. Business or entrepreneurship is completely off limits for her given her family restrictions.\n\nDespite all this, I’ve noticed something important about her. She manages to take sunset and nature pictures as like she got this attraction with clicking pictures. She’s also a space enthusiast, so she often stays up late to capture events.\n\nUnfortunately, she doesn’t have a camera, so the quality of the pictures isn’t great.\nThe main reason for me telling all this is because she told me she wants to contribute to our goals. But since she can’t directly work on business or entrepreneurship, she wants to do it through things she’s already allowed to do. \n\nSo she asked me if we could utilize her photography to earn money and scale. And honestly, I have no idea if that’s even possible, so I’m asking here for guidance.\n\nI’ve also noticed she’s a big enthusiast of storytelling. She’s currently writing a novel (at least that’s what she told me), and it’s genuinely good. I’ve read a few pages she managed to write (she can’t spend much time on it), and the story impressed me. I think she could potentially use this skill too.\n\nOverall, I want to know whether her skills (photography or writing) can realistically be used to earn money, even at a small scale given our constraints. If any experienced people have some advice for us, we'd genuinely appreciate.",

You could have her quietly hone in on that, offering creatively written stories, company blurbs, and self-published fiction books. Really sell that storytelling capability; she has quite a few options as a “storyteller.” \n\nI’m a writer myself, and I found early success that same way by tapping into the pen.  \n\nBecause in truth you don’t need much to write; you just need your thoughts and something to write with, and you obviously have access to the internet (not sure if she does), so at least one of you could push out her offerings to the public.

I ask who and its literally this same guy. Turns out hes been running his own cleaning business the whole time, just started it in August. All those \"jobs\" he hired us for were him basically taking notes on our entire operation.\n\nHe even asked me once about our employee retention and I told him we give small bonuses when we hit quarterly goals because it keeps people motivated. Now Im wondering if he copied that too. The whole thing has me stressed and Im glad I at least have some money saved aside from Stаke personally because I might need to pivot some things if he starts undercutting us.\n\nPart of me wants to be annoyed but I dont know if I can even do anything about it?

I have several people I trade lead referrals with for various reasons that do the exact same thing I do and their existance makes my life easier.\n\nTLDR: If they value themselves appropriately and dont drag down the market I wouldnt care. If they undercut do not play that game it means they are failing in some area and desperate to get work, you will win in the long run or they will drop to a lower tier of clientele to continue existing and not be your problem anymore either way. You have an existing base and quality standards, sell the quality of your service and your years of experience, you don't need to be the cheapest.",

      "selftext": "I've been doing web development for about 4 years. Back in March I landed a restaurant owner who needed a simple website menu, hours, contact form, maybe 10 pages total. $2,500, signed contract, everything by the book. First month goes great. He's responsive, sends assets on time, compliments the work. I'm thinking this is the dream client. Then the site launches and the \"quick questions\" start. \"Can you just add a reservations button?\" Sure, 30 minutes, I'll throw it in. \"Can you make the menu downloadable as a PDF?\" Fine, easy. \"Can you add a little animation to the header?\" Okay, getting annoying but whatever. By month two I've done maybe 15 of these \"quick\" things. I finally sit down and add it up 12 hours of extra work. At my rate that's $600 I just gave away for free. So I send him a nice email explaining that future changes will be billed hourly, gave him my rate, even offered a discount because we had a good relationship. He loses it. Says I'm \"nickel and diming\" him. Says a \"real professional\" would stand behind their work. Says he thought we were \"building something together.\" I tried to explain the original scope was delivered months ago but he just kept saying \"it's the same website though.\"\n\nYesterday he left me a 1-star Google review saying I \"surprised him with hidden fees after the project was done.\" The thing that kills me is I don't even think he's being malicious. He genuinely doesn't understand that what he asked for was extra. In his head, he hired me to \"do his website\" and the website isn't done until he says it's done. I should have had this conversation after the second or third request. Instead I stayed quiet trying to be the \"chill\" freelancer and now I'm the bad guy. How do you even explain scope to a client who doesn't think in those terms? Or do you just avoid these clients entirely?",

          "body": "My solution to this problem with clients works every time.\n\nStep 1: have client send links to sites similar to what they want their site to look like and similar to the contents they envision. Tell them to group the links by (a) sites with color schemes they like, (b) with layouts they like, and (c) content and content organization they like.\n\nStep 2: set up a 15 minute zoom call to go through the sites they provide so you have an idea for layout, color and mending. Keep it to 15 minutes, you are training the client to be concise.\n\nStep 3: create 3 mock-ups. I call them mentally bare-bones, expected choice, and kitchen sink. But I describe them to the client as entry level business profile, typical feature informational website, and custom professional website. Price differential should be very wide, like $800, $2,200 and $25,000.\n\nStep 3: give them a process timeline and a build analogy. I use a home building metaphor which goes \"We first draw the blueprint, and you can make any change at that point such as different layout, menus, number of pages or sections, features, etc. Then we lay the foundation which is where we register the URL, build the menus (plumbing), lay out each page (rooms). Then we complete the look and feel with text and images (finish carpentry and flooring.)\" You do this to be able to say \"remember, i told you there is no charge to change the site layout during 'blueprint' phase, but we are now at the finish stage and the change you are asking for takes us back two stages, so it will be expensive to do this as we have to tear up the pipes and cement. I will give you a price quote for that change.\"\n\nThis works for me. When they jump to \"hey, we really need to add a blah-blah-widget\" you can say \"Great! That was one of the features I suggested in my proposal for a professional level site! Should I go ahead and give you a quote for that addition?\"",

You should have already, after 4 years, addresses the cut off time for included updates, and the cost for additional updates and the cost. Be clear about maintenance going forward. Ask if they want a pre-paid retainer or to do it by the item.\n2. You basically punished them for making updates and failed to provide CLEAR information about future updates. It can feel like getting nickel and dimed.\n3. You offered to do the work free - you started the problem.\n4. In consultations, I say something like: \"The website is done. You pay the final invoice. A month goes by and you want to update the site. Depending on what you need, the maintenance cost is this, this, or this. You can do it hourly, or purchase a discounted update pack for a group of changes, or a retainer for regular updates.\"\n5. If a client doesn't understand what's extra, that's a failing on your part. It needs to be in writing and it needs to be initialed and it needs to be communicated several times, and you need to get an answer on how they plant to manage the site going forward.\n6. You can offer a monthly update for XYZ dollars and it might include (5) updates and you list those updates. Major functionality like a reservation system with a mobile app, or getting DoorDash functionality, etc. All the updates requested above, I'd do in a monthly maintenance session for $55 - about 20 minutes of work usually. Adding a menu PDF is problematic, the menu changes, add a solution where they can make updates to the menu and a \"Print PDF\" is automatic.\n7. There are tasks as Webmaster that are included in their annual hosting/domain renewal - things like new email addresses, backups, restore, etc.\n8. I took a lot of lumps when I started my brand and web development company. Each issue with a client taught me how to be smarter with the next.\n9. I made a lot of areas self-manageable and offered to train them or an employee. I also included a user guide with easy steps to update a page or add a page.\n10. All these things they are asking for should have been offered anyway. Go ahead and add these items to your offerings for restaurants.\n11. I also make them complete an online form in their account, for requesting updates. They check boxes for what they want done, and it indicates \"included in current maintenance plan\" or \"additional fees\". If they go over a certain amount, it adds fees. One client dumped me because he wanted to text me at all hours and I told him I don't do business by text. Log in to his account and submit requests - there needs to be a record. He came back after a while.\n12. It sounds cliche, but an educated customer is your best customer - you have to educate them.\n\n**Good luck next time. As for the 1 star, if you're able to respond:**\n\n&gt;\" Nicks Cafe is a valued client and we are proud of the work we were able to do in launching their new web site. The contracted and paid web design phase was for 6 weeks. Once the site launched, any updates are billed either hourly or through a maintenance plan. Any errors or loss of functionality, we correct at no charge, but new pages, new features, or changes or deletions, are billed items. We apologize that the maintenance costs were not understood. We welcome the opportunity to make it right by offering a discounted 1 year maintenance plan. We have reached out to Nick with this offer.\"\n\nFigure out what deep discount you can offer to save your reputation and reach out to the client. For me, it's worth it to even give him a set amount of updates per month for a year at $100. The business you lose is infinite. Be sure to come up with a pricing plan for 2027 that keeps him happy after you see what he requested in updates this year. I also use clients like this to try out new features I install free. Then when it's tested, I can actively market it and point to them as a LIVE example.\n\nA lot of people are telling you to snark, but it's partly your fault for not being clear. If you value customers who put food on the table, be kind, but be firm and professional. My business was 99% word of mouth. Not one client in my portfolio would say a bad word about me. Do whatever it takes to make it right - within reason - and fine tune your contracts and communication about price.\n\nIn freelancing, when there's a problem, take a look a how you failed. If it's not in writing, it's you. DM me and I can share some CRM solutions that help you manage clients and costs and requests.",

The ideal solution would be not to bill on hours -- for **this** contract/website. *In his mind*, he didn't agree to an hourly rate, or sign off on menu items, so they feel like tack-ons, and he has no out but to settle on a subpar website. In his mind, it feels like being taken hostage -- he can keep paying more and more at a rate he didn't necessarily agree to pay, to reach a complete website; or he can accept a subpar website. Neither solution is really palatable to him, so maybe he felt no other escape but an angry review.\n\nSolution: In the next contract, either break down 'website' further into individual items (button == X, subpage == Y, copy edit == Z, ...) or just spell out the hourly rate for add-ons.\n\nFrom your standpoint, what you can do to recover those lost/unbilled hours is to charge a higher hourly rate on this next contract. So over time, you break even again and even go higher. But don't damage the client relationship by nickel-and-diming. You have a right to your time, but acknowledge his feelings, turn him positive by saying you'll do it for free **for this website** \\-- and then just spell out hourly rates or a menu of items in the next contract. You'll make a fan out of him and come out ahead, plus he won't leave that review.\n\nAt this stage, maybe you can ask for him to remove the 1-star review in that next contract.\n\nThis is how I've done it. I've been on both sides. His feelings are sound. So are yours. Just take the loss on this one contract, then apply your adjusted expectations to the next one -- or walk away. Think long-term. You want happy clients. Guys who are noisy 1-star reviews are also noisy in 5-star praise. So turn him into the 5-star guy by swallowing your ego, acknowledging his feelings, and then playing for the next contract, with much more specific breakdowns and a favorable hourly rate.

If you're explicit in what it does (or doesn't) include, you're totally in the right to be concerned about these overages (they're also costing you way more than the little bit of time you're accounting for as each task, that's a separate topic). However, if you don't have a scope, or it's lacking in detail, that's on you and you need to improve your communication. If you spell out what's in your scope but don't spell out that anything beyond the scope if \"X per hour, 30 minute minimum\", you need to fix that, too. \n\nMost problems humans have with each other is just lack of clear communication and understanding and doing that effectively is VERY difficult and no matter what you do, there'll be things that are missed (or ignored).\n\nWelcome to business!",

So every new idea still feels like “the same website” to them.\n\nWhere things usually go wrong (and you already spotted this) is silence. Each “quick favor” silently resets their expectation of what’s included. By the time you bring up billing, it feels sudden to them — even if it’s completely reasonable.\n\nWhat’s worked better for me over time:\n\n* Define the scope in **plain outcomes**, not technical tasks launch-ready site with X pages; post-launch changes billed.\n* Introduce the concept of paid changes **early**, even if you waive the first 1–2 small ones. That sets the mental model.\n* Frame it as a **process**, not a fee: “After launch, all changes go through a small change request so nothing breaks.”\n\nAs for avoiding these clients — you usually can’t. Restaurants, small businesses, first-time website owners often think this way. The real filter isn’t the client; it’s whether you enforce boundaries *before* resentment builds.\n\nThe Google review hurts, but honestly, most experienced freelancers reading your story will recognize it immediately because we’ve all learned this lesson the same way.",

Last year I landed this marketing agency that became my anchor client steady projects, $1,000-1,200 a month, super professional, paid within 48 hours every time. I'm thinking this is what sustainable freelancing looks like. Around November they tell me their business partner is launching a new venture and needs a developer. \"You'd be perfect for this, they're great to work with, we've been in business together for 6 years.\" I take the referral because of course I do. Good client vouching for someone, easy decision. First call with the referral and I can already tell something's off. Vague about requirements, keeps saying \"we'll figure it out as we go,\" but I push through because I trust my original client's judgment. Project starts and it's a nightmare. Constantly changing scope, wants daily updates, questions every decision, rude on calls. \"Why is this taking so long?\" \"I found a template that does this in 10 minutes.\" \"My nephew said he could build this.\" I'm bending over backwards trying to make it work detailed documentation, extra calls, revisions I'm not charging for. Two months in I finally realize this isn't going to get better. I send a professional email saying I don't think we're the right fit, offered to transition everything to another developer, even gave them a partial refund for the hassle. They lose it. Email my original client saying I \"abandoned their project\" and \"wasted their time.\" Suddenly my anchor client is cold. \"You made me look bad in front of my partner.\" \"I vouched for you.\" Haven't gotten a new project from them since. It's been two months.\n\nThat referral didn't just cost me one bad client, it killed a $10K/year relationship I spent a year building. The thing that kills me is I don't even know what I was supposed to do differently. Keep working with someone who made every day miserable? Or stand my ground and lose my best client anyway? How do you handle nightmare referrals from good clients without torching the relationship? Or do you just never take referrals?",

The only time that you can really end this relationship with the bad client without upsetting the other client is to make sure that you don’t take on a bad client.\n\nOnce you have a bad client, you have to stick to your process. You have to make them follow your process. They will probably get annoyed with your process if they’re a bad client, and if you’re lucky, hopefully they’ll fire you and not ruin the relationship with your good client. You gotta try to figure out how to get it to a mutual understanding, not you firing them as a client.",

Then you take those and use them to point out and rejustify your value to him. \n\nWhile there are plenty of Karen and obnoxious ass hats I find you can either put them in line with strict procedures and rules while setting expectations clearly ahead of time or they will say \"Well I don't like that\" and you simply reply with \"Well I'm not the only web designer on the planet, if you want someone else to do this project who will give you daily updates you can find someone else who will as I am probably just not the right fit.\".

He says I'd be perfect for this project.\n\nAlready in my gut I thought this might be trouble.

After that, if they want to refer, I tell them to point the person at my web site for intake and go from there.\n\nReferral: I start with the intake and proceed as though it it's a cold call from a random.  If they start trying to play games (not answering questions, not being specific, implying that they expect special treatment, etc.), I immediately move into the \"I'm really busy right now and I am speaking to you as a favor to 'referrer', but honesty I don't think I can help you right now.\" and send them on their way.\n\nIf existing client asks, I just say \"I couldn't take on the work and maintain quality of my other clients based on some of their expectations.\"",

Use that data to create an FAQ or addendum to contract or discovery call checklist or whatever. It's your business. You're in charge. Yes, you need clients and income but you get to decide who your best client is, know why that works when it works, and require courteous and professional engagement within boundaries you set. \n\nGood luck!",

          "body": "You’re not imagining it. This is very common on LinkedIn right now. High likes and comments don’t mean buying intent. Most engagement is performative, people commenting to stay visible in their own network rather than because they’re interested in clicking, DMing, or purchasing. A lot of what looks authentic is driven by automation, engagement pods, or templated replies. Not always bots, but close enough that it feels real and still converts to nothing.\nShared posts are especially weak for results. LinkedIn aggressively suppresses outbound links, and reshares almost never drive referral traffic. Seeing zero visitors even with thousands of likes isn’t unusual. On top of that, commenters are rarely leads. Real buyers usually lurk, save the post, or Google you later. They don’t ask public questions or say they’re “interested” in the comments.\nWhat actually works on LinkedIn is slower and less exciting. Posting consistently from your own founder profile, speaking directly to problem-aware buyers, and treating LinkedIn as a conversation and positioning channel rather than a traffic source. At YellowInk, we only see results when businesses stop chasing vanity metrics and focus on message and positioning over 30–60 days.\n\n\nTL;DR: LinkedIn isn’t broken, but paid shoutouts mostly are. Your spend didn’t buy leads, but it did buy clarity.",

He specifically wanted this textured raised ink effect which required puff printing and that added to the cost but he said no problem. I ordered all the blank hoodies, did the setup work, printed everything, shipped it all out in early December. He confirmed delivery and even sent me a photo saying they looked great.   \nThen last week I got notified by my payment processor that he filed a dispute claiming the quality wasn’t as described and he wants a full refund including the deposit. I reached out immediately with all our email correspondence, the approved design files, his confirmation photo, everything. The payment processor said they’re still reviewing but it could go either way.   \nI’m out almost $4000 in materials and labor if this goes through.

They took your product without paying for it. This isn't the same thing as not paying an invoice for a service provided.\n\nIf it were me, if they don't respond to my email request trying to make it right, I'd hire a lawyer and send them a strongly worded, certified letter educating them on the fact they've committed theft, highlighting previous case law, and pointing out it is a felony due to the value of the product. If they ignore the letter/don't respond, press charges. This isn't them not paying an invoice that you take to small claims court. This is fraud, and theft of product. Not services.\n\nGive them the opportunity to make it right, and maybe even offer a 10% discount, since they seem to think the product is not to their standard. Alternatively, they can return all of the product for a refund per your original contract (Hopefully you stated deposits are non-refundable. Do not refund the deposit).\n\nThen turn around and burn the company by turning those hoodies into some sort of art piece and selling them for cheap. Double points if you're in the companies HQ town.

Call your processor and push for “representment” Ask what reason code it is and what evidence they weigh most for that code. Use their exact checklist.\n2. Send a formal demand letter Even without a lawyer, a short written demand (amount owed, deadline, evidence, next steps) can scare scammers. A local small-business attorney can write it cheaply if needed.\n3. If you have his company details, invoice the business and pursue small claims $4k is often within small-claims limits. Your documentation sounds strong.\n4. Protect yourself going forward\n\n* For custom orders: “No refunds after approval/production” in writing\n* Consider 60–100% upfront for large custom runs\n* Signed proof at delivery, photo of finished goods before ship\n* Pay via ACH/wire for big B2B jobs (harder to chargeback)\n* Add a clause: disputes must be raised within X days of delivery\n\nNot legal advice, but with an approval trail + delivery proof + “looks great” message, you have a solid case for winning the dispute.

The hard part is not just “winning the dispute,” it’s that one chargeback can create a cash crunch because you already paid for blanks, labor, shipping, and you cannot resell the product. That’s why for big custom orders you want a simple system that treats chargebacks like a predictable risk: clear written approvals, “custom goods are final” terms, signature delivery, and milestone payments before shipment so you are never carrying the full cost.\n\nThis is also exactly why weekly cash planning matters. If one dispute can put you underwater, it means there is no buffer for shocks. A weekly view of minimum cash you refuse to dip under, big payments coming up, and what is safe to spend this week keeps one bad customer from becoming a business-threatening week. If you share the dispute reason and whether you have signature delivery, I can tell you what evidence usually matters most in the response.",

We had property listings and everything happening, but behind the scenes it was pretty chaotic. Leads were coming from everywhere but follow ups weren’t consistent and a lot of things lived in spreadsheets or just in my head lol... I’m not very tech-savvy, so it always felt harder than it probably needed to be.\n\nI got introduced to Michael Ripia through other real estate agencies we knew (not ads or cold emails) which is why I was open to the conversation bcos i dont usually trust cold outreach lol...One of the first things we worked on wasn’t marketing or ads at all which kind of shocked me because thats what i thought the problem was. Turns out it was getting the foundations right. \n\nWe set up our hubspot CRM properly and actually used it the way it’s meant to be used. That meant cleaning up our database, setting up proper pipelines for sellers and buyers, automating follow-ups, and making sure enquiries didn’t just disappear if someone got busy.\n\nWe also tightened up how listings were marketed and tracked, so we could see what was working. Once that was in place, lead flow became an absolute breeze.\n\nWe’re now on track to hit around $2.1M in revenue by Q1 for this year, which is something I wouldn’t have believed from previous years, especially given how messy the businesses systems were...\n\nOne thing I really valued was that we didn’t stay reliant on outside help. Before finishing up, he helped me build an in-house marketing team of three and trained them on the systems, so the it kept running without me needing to be across every detail. Not posting this to brag, just sharing what worked for us. If you’re running a small business, especially in real estate and feel like growth is there but structure isn’t, this might be relatable.",

          "body": "Congrats on hitting $2.1M... the CRM foundation piece is massively underrated because most real estate operators think they need more leads when really they're just losing 30-40% of existing inquiries to broken follow-up systems... I work with commercial real estate clients ($100k+ monthly spend accounts) to scale their google and meta campaigns where we see the same pattern constantly which is they'll come in asking for lead gen campaigns but when I audit their backend I find leads sitting uncontacted for 5-7 days in their CRM because nobody set up automated assignment rules or response SLAs.\n\nThe way I structure it for these clients is we don't touch ad budget until their HubSpot or Salesforce has proper lead scoring, automated nurture sequences for cold inquiries, and webhook integrations pushing qualified leads directly into their agents' phones via SMS within 60 seconds... because when you're spending $150k+ monthly driving 400-600 property inquiries the difference between a 2-minute and 2-hour response time is literally 80% of your conversion rate... and no amount of creative testing or audience optimization fixes a broken operational backend that lets buyers ghost before anyone even calls them back.",

Open ended questions: instead of telling them what you think is wrong ask them \"Well what would happen if none of the stuff I left you got done?\"\n\nThese tend to help you get across a point without you telling them and they usually will realize your point on their own. Or you realize they don't understand the purpose behind the work and you can clarify it. \n\n2. Mirroring: basically you repeat the last couple words they said or in the sentence they said in a question. \n\nExample: \nX: well lashaun never had me do any of that, just deal with customers. \n\nYou: Never had you do that?\n\nX: yeah she said it was all manager stuff anyways. \n\nThis will always get people to expand on something or explain. \n\nYou can also purposely say something a little incorrect back to them and they will instinctively want to correct you and give you more information. \n\nExample:\n\nX: well lashaun never had me do any of that, just deal with customers. \n\nYou: Had you do everything?\n\nX: No no no, she told me that was all manager stuff so she never had me do that stuff. \n\n3. Commit with a no, people feel safe saying no, so instead of trying to get them to say yes to something, rephrase your question to a no. \n\nExample:\n\nWould I be crazy to ask you to just finish the list I give you for work? \n\nAm I being an asshole to tell you to take out the trash? \n\nEtc.\n\n4. \"Seems like\", similar to mirroring but you make an assumption, start it with seems like, looks like, feels like, sounds like, etc and state your assumption of what you think is happening and let them comment on it or correct you. \n\nExample:\n\nYou: It seems like Lashaun never properly trained you. \n\nX: Yeah she never did any training with me .......\n\nOr\n\nYou: Seems like you feel underpaid and treated like shit. \n\nX: I mean I could always use more pay but you have actually been pretty fine as a boss.\n\n5. Put them together, you can use those techniques together to basically pull lots of information from this employee, understand them and their viewpoint completely, and then from this understanding help them shift it by aligning what you want them to do with their thoughts, feelings, goals, etc.\n\nEdit: forgot one, similar to the seems like, but basically you call out what you think they might feel when you say something. \n\nDon't say \"I'm not trying to be an asshole\" instead call it out \"I'm probably gonna be an asshole for saying this\" then say what you want to say. People tend to handle it much better when you call it out ahead of time.",

For me to have 2TB of storage, everyone has to have 2TB of storage t $14.\n\nI think my best solution is to have everyone in my business on the $7 starter plan, then pay an additional $99/year for a 2TB Google One subscription. Not ideal, but overall it's the best value. \n\nWhere is everyone else moving their company emails?",

          "body": "There were several reasons to pull your email from other services into Gmail using POP3 retrieval. For some of them there are workarounds, for others not.\n\n1. You want to read all your email from two or more servers in one email client, i.e., Gmail.\n\n2. You want to back up all your email received on other servers in an online archive without paying for the storage, preferably one with lots of capacity, good search tools, good security, and easily accessible from anywhere, i.e. Gmail. (Presumably you also keep a local copy if you are smart.)\n\n3. You want to take advantage of Gmail's spam filtering and flexible auto filters applied to incoming email.\n\nThe solution that satisfies all 3 and is pretty much equivalent to what is being lost is to simply turn the direction of communications around and have your other email servers forward all email to Gmail instead of having Gmail retrieve the email by POP3 polling. This satisfies all 3 of the functions and it's faster (forwarding happens in seconds, whereas Gmail polls at irregular intervals which can stretch to hours). Problems: your other email services may not have a \"forward all\" function, or they may add a header which makes it look like the forwarded mail is coming from you rather than the original sender. And then there's the spam issue: there's a danger that dumb spam-blockers may decide that you are the originator of any spam among the emails that you are forwarding to Gmail, and therefore your email address should be blacklisted as a spammer (and yes, this does happen - I've encountered it, had to give up forwarding).\n\nOther partial solutions:\n\nThe Gmail app (not the web interface) allows you to view email from your other services together with your Gmail in the common Gmail interface. You just add your other services to the app as additional email sources. But this is view-only. This satisfies function#1. It does not retrieve that email and add it to your Gmail account, so no good for functions #2 and #3.\n\nYou can use an IMAP-enabled email client like Thunderbird, both on the desktop and as an app. Thunderbird lets you add Gmail (via IMAP) and your other IMAP/POP servers in one interface. And it lets you copy email to and from IMAP clients like Gmail. So it satisfies functions #1 and #2, although you have to do the copying manually. Sadly Gmail does not apply incoming email rules or spam filtering to email copied in via IMAP., so function #3 is out.",

          "body": "Wise has been the most reliable for us with contractors in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus. The key is making sure your contractor sets up a proper Wise account on their end - they can receive in USD and hold it there or convert to local currency when rates are favorable.\n\nFew things that help avoid AML flags on the receiving end:\n\n1. Consistent, documented payments on a regular schedule (invoices help)\n2. Amounts that match what you'd expect for contractor work, not round numbers that look like crypto cashouts\n3. Having them receive directly into Wise rather than converting through local banks\n\nPayoneer works too but I've found their fees slightly higher for smaller amounts. SWIFT is fine but slow and expensive ($25-40 per transfer depending on banks).\n\nFor Georgia specifically, TBC Bank and Bank of Georgia both have decent USD account options if your contractor wants a local bank account that's crypto-separate. The issue your dev had was likely the P2P exchange triggering the flag, not the payment source itself.\n\nEOR is overkill for a single contractor unless you're planning to hire more in Georgia or need the legal protection of having them as an employee.",

Why are none of the top 10 most-popular cars economy cars? \n\nI think the issue (and I'm making a point in a second) is that the average person is not buying new cars. They're holding onto the car they had, not replacing cars once they break permanently, and buying used. Who's buying cars has skewed. \n\nI think the same thing is happening with business launches.

Most commercial leases are 3 years, especially for new businesses. Even big franchisees usually sign for 5 years with a renew option. People aren't paying rent on 15-year old leases. And even if their lease was low, their NNN has probably exploded lately. \n\nFew people own a commercial property that they can use AND live in the building.

While these methods can work, they often require a lot of manual effort. That’s where [WebIeadr](https://webleadr.pages.dev) comes in. A platform where web designers, developers, SEO specialists, and similar professionals can easily find and contact web design leads such as businesses without websites, in just a couple of clicks, along with many other features (check the website to explore all of them)!\n\nWebIeadr offers a one-time, credit-based system: **$12 for 100 business leads**. No subscriptions or recurring fees: pay only when needed. Credits stay in your account and can be used anytime, with options to buy more as needed. For example, if 40 out of 100 leads lack websites and 15 use third-party services (e.g., Facebook), and you secure just a mere 3 clients with basic sales skills, you could earn around $2,000. Your cost? Just $12\n\nThe bottom line is that WebIeadr offers an extremely quick and efficient solution to find web design leads in just a few clicks and **call them in just one click of a button**. From there, all you need to do is apply your sales skills to convince them that having a website is a worthwhile investment for their business.\n\nKnow a web designer, developer, or SEO specialist who could benefit from this? Please share this post with them. They’ll thank you later!",

Whether you're a tradesperson, consultant, freelancer, or growing business, the right number can make you instantly recognisable and easier to reach.\n\n\nWhy it matters:\n- Brand recall: A clean, memorable number sticks in your customer’s mind long after the conversation ends.  \n- Professional image: It signals that you take your business seriously and pay attention to the details.  \n- Customer trust: People are more likely to call a number that feels simple, clear, and intentional.  \n- Marketing impact: Whether on vans, business cards, websites, or ads, a standout number boosts response rates.\n\n\nAt SimpleSimUK.com, we've built a small startup focused on helping UK professionals secure premium, easy‑to‑remember mobile numbers without the usual hassle or inflated prices. It’s a simple idea, but one that genuinely elevates how people perceive your brand.\n\n\nIf you’re building your business, levelling up your personal brand, or just want a number that works as hard as you do, take a look at what we are creating.\n\n\n🌍 https://www.SimpleSimUK.com\n\n📞 +44 7777 787171\n\n\nSmall details build strong brands and your number is one of them.\n\n\n#SimpleSimUK #PersonalBranding #ProfessionalBranding #UKBusiness #SmallBusinessUK #StartupLifeUK #EntrepreneurMindset #BrandIdentity #MemorableNumbers #VIPNumbers #TradesBusiness #ConsultantLife #FreelancerTips #MarketingEssentials #CustomerExperience #StandOutFromTheCrowd",

Do to this a side hustle wasn't really an option, so it was go all in or don't. \n\nIt's been an interesting time, and I'm glad I made the jump.  It's not been stress free, there have been multiple issues that made me stop and wonder if I made the right decision.  But you stick it out, adjust, and make it work. \n\nRemember there is alot that goes into running a successful business besides actually doing the work.  There is bookkeeping, advertising, taxes, networking, ect...  If you are like me and are doing this solo, you are on your own. It doesn't sound like a ton, but when you're flush with work it stacks quickly.  \n\nBe detail-oriented.  It will help with multiple aspects, especially when doing your books. \n\nDo NOT underestimate the cost of insurance. Not just for the business, but your health insurance as well.  Last year I paid over $25k for my family's health insurance, its fucking expensive. \n\nThere is ALOT that goes into it, but what you get out is worth it. I was in business for 9 months last year and made about $200k in revenue.  My profit margin is about 60%, so I did ok.  This year I'm working on optimizing, growing my customer base and offered services, and investing in productizing an automation solution.\n\nIt can be done, but you have to have your heart in it.  That's important because there will be many times your head tells you to give up.   Good luck!",

          "body": "I did this but was joined with an ex-colleague of mine who I really trusted and was open to quitting to hop into entrepreneurship. We're very knowledgeable in our craft (working in tech revenue operations) so we opted to go into consulting versus building to have a steady cash flow.\n\nEach year we've learned a ton of things and almost had a 'theme' to it.\n\nYear 1 was about figuring out how to be a business. Figuring out our pitch, our messaging, our artifacts (eg. SOW), and all of that was all new. We also had the benefit of having a wide network with some translating to be some of first few clients. This allowed us to hire (and fire) people as needed.\n\nYear 2 was about learning how to execute. Still riding off of our network, enough word of mouth about us allowed us to hire more people. This was an interesting time since we were still figuring out how to deliver but also need to figure out how our team members can lighten up our load. At this point we were starting to feel like it was a business.\n\nYear 3 was about scaling and the harsh truths about business. Year 3 was by far the toughest. We've scaled to have a great team, we've gotten some good projects out but the reality is that nothing stays good forever. Client churns really affected us. Bad contracts that we signed got us on the hook for hard deliverables with minimal returns. Poor fiscal planning also caused us to close up shop. You have to remember that being business owners also means that multiple families now depend on your business for their livelihood -- which was personally for me was a very heavy responsibility and the real threat of closing up shop was a tough pill to swallow. We've made it out well after a very rocky start and blessed to live and tell the tale.\n\nYear 4 is where we're at now and the theme will be GTM (GoToMarket) this year. Our network is starting to dry up and we have to pivot to direct to customers at this point. As business owners, I can say that we've gone through quite a bit of battle scars. We're wiser but we still have lots to learn. This year we've beefed up our cash reserves to make sure we're able to navigate through hard times while preserving our team that we truly love working with. I personally am figuring out how we can perform marketing and be a good boss. We've expanded our skill sets to blend AI and RevOps together to actually build stuff that is valuable and not just junkware.\n\nSo it's been a wild ride so far. There were more rough times and rosy periods but the people you meet along the way, the experiences that you get exposed to, the hard decisions that noone else could make -- all these things, I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\nBe ready for a ton of sacrifices. It's not just time and effort. It's also relationships, mental and fiscal sanity.\n\nWould I do it again knowing what I know? I'm not sure. Financially, you don't get to see the returns until the end (I would 100% make more money working for a software company given my skill sets) so it's hard to say. Professionally, being your own boss is both awesome and a curse. Mentally, I've definitely developed to be more stoic but pretty sure that I'm also starting to develop bi-polarism lol. You'll miss your family, your friends, yourself.. but when you're there you also come to understand how privileged to have something that's growing regardless of the outcome -- so maybe the journey is the reward.\n\nGood luck to you brother/sister!",

          "body": "I'm just beginning my third year as a solopreneur.  As others have said, it's a blessing and a curse.  You are your own boss, you eat what you kill (for better or worse), you don't spend as much time with your family as you would like, you don't get paid vacation, etc.  Health insurance is beyond brutal, like eye-popping brutal.  But you are building something for yourself, and you can take on whatever kind of business you like, and do it in the way that you think is best for the client.\n\nI used to lead finance at a few high-growth, VC-backed startup companies.  I got fed up with the BS of internal politics and the pressure to run things differently than I wanted to.  So I took some time off to clear my head, then gradually stepped into doing \"fractional\" CFO work.  I get to do the kind of work I love, all day, every day, and I don't have to sit through hours of internal meetings that add little value.  My clients are SO appreciative of what I do for them.  I rarely heard \"thank you\" when I was in-house at my prior companies.  I hear it all the time now.  I've been able to leverage my network to get clients, I've never had to advertise or even solicit business in any way, people actually come to me via word of mouth, and my clients refer me to their friends unsolicited because I do great work for them and genuinely help them solve problems.  The work is way more rewarding than my old job, despite me actually performing the same job as before, just in a different way.\n\nIt took me about a year to replace my prior salary.  I probably could have done that faster but I wanted to gradually step into it and enjoy the early days.  It's been hard work but quite fun.  I haven't even leaned fully into it.  I've been approaching it as more of a lifestyle business where I'm less concerned with maximizing the opportunity and primarily just don't want to have a boss (though in reality it's FAR from a lifestyle business -- long hours and some stress when clients turn over and you need to replace them -- there will be good months and less-good months).\n\nI price reasonably, which works well for the smaller to mid-sized business I serve, but I don't compete on price.  My field is crowded with lots of subpar providers that often don't know what they are doing (posers), and the good providers are often both really expensive and inflexible in how they work with clients (e.g., they are often focused on providing scalable solutions with something of a one-size-fits-all playbook).  I fill the void in the middle, with more of an reasonable price + customized service to give people what they really want.  I could charge more for what I do -- possibly double -- and I will probably raise prices at some point this year, but not to anywhere near that degree.  Up until now I've just been so giddy about helping people and enjoying the ride of doing this on my own, that I haven't minded leaving some money on the table.  I have an abundance mindset: there's enough to go around for everyone, and at the end of the day, you can have anything in this world that you want, as long as you are willing to put in the work required to get it.\n\n  \nWishing you luck on your journey.  You've got this!",

Most stress relief stuff (stress balls, massagers, etc) also got left, as did anything wearable or decorative (shirts, hats, stickers, etc) where the main design was a random company logo. Wearables like shirts also ran into sizing issues. \n\nNotebooks and pens were popular for educational conferences or places where note taking happens.

You can get away with missing 1 or 2 payments on operations, not much beyond that.  Make sure there are no overdraft fees or nsf fees with this account.

          "body": "I run a web agency for home services. Here’s everything I tell my clients to do:\n\n1) google business profile. Get as many reviews on their as possible. 3-4 a week maximum or it gets flagged as spam and suspended. If your competition has 20 reviews in the top 3 of the maps pack, you need 30-40. Add lots of pictures, fill it in 100%. \n\nThen since you’re a service based business, DONT have a publicly visible address on google especially if you don’t want people coming to your home. I don’t have mine on my profile since I don’t have a publicly facing office. It will think people go to that address for your services and only show your profile in searches near that location. You need to remove it and select the option that you’re a service based business and select your 20 town service area so you can show up in searches 30 min away. \n\n2) website - just because it’s never been easier to make your own website doesn’t mean you should. It’s hard. It’s not enough to just build a site and think it will rank number 1. Web design is HARD and our brains are wired to pick up on patterns and symmetry. If your design doesn’t follow strict spacing systems and design guides then your brain will pick up on it and it will feel “off”. It’s the uncanny valley of design. It looks like a website, but it doesn’t quite look professional and you don’t know why. Your customers will have the same feeling. That’s what it is. Your design is important, don’t just slap anything together. \n\nAnd your load times matter. If your site takes more than 3 seconds to load you lose 50% of your traffic because it takes too long to load. That high bounce rate, low click through rate, and low session times tell Google you’re not a good results for the searches that come to you and you don’t rank well. That’s how a slow loading site can impact your ranking and conversions. You won’t show up on search results and the people who do find you won’t even reach your site. The average site takes 3-6 seconds to load. Page builders are notorious for it. They have a ton a bloat that has to load to make it work. So when you get a website done, use this to test it \n\nhttps://pagespeed.web.dev\n\nMake sure it loads fast and has at least 75-80/100 mobile performance score. \n\nThen there’s the content. SEO is such a broad term. It’s not “optimizing meta tags and submitting to the search console and ranking for 3 keywords” bullshit. It’s not a plugin either. It’s a process. You can’t rank a home page for multiple services and multiple locations. It’s impossible. So instead what you do is create location specific service pages to rank high for those service in those locations. Like this page on my site \n\nhttps://oakharborwebdesigns.com/hammond/small-business-web-designer/\n\nThis page shows up number 1 for “web designer Hammond in”. We did that for dozens of locations and multiple services to blanket the area in content and dominate the search results in a geographical region. THATS SEO. If you have an SEO person you hired and they aren’t doing this then they are not doing SEO. And blogging is its own thing. You use a service like “answer the public” to search for the most searched questions related to a service or product you offer and write blog posts answering those questions. Good blogs answer questions. You capture that traffic from the blog and convert it into leads. Even if that traffic isn’t in your state, it’s traffic. And Google notices you getting more and more traffic to this blog pages for certain related topics to your niche and that tells google you’re an expert on the subject matter and your domain now gets more authority for those keywords. More traffic + higher click through rates + longer session times = more authority and better ranking. That’s how all this works. Do that + backlinking and you have an SEO campaign. But it’s hard to do right. That’s why you hire a competent SEO expert to do this for you and monitor it. It’s not an exact science. We can do everything right and still not get to the front page. So what my SEO guy does is monitor your pages and when he sees ones that are going down in ranking or not going up, he will investigate it and rewrite the page until Google starts liking it and ranking it. Anyone who says they can guarantee results is a liar so watch out. Good SEO people don’t say that. Because it’s impossible to guarantee. All we can do is what we’re supposed to do and the rest is up to Google. And our job is to battle with them for supremacy. Sometimes it’s a longer battle than expected. But over time it will show results when done properly. \n\n3) ads. Google ads is great for service based businesses. Don’t run ads to your home page. Won’t work. People clicked that ad for a specific service, they wanna see it. If you send them to a home page and have to go looking for that thing they clicked the link for they will bounce. You send them to a dedicated landing page for that ad and service. Converts much higher. And if you have a website with a high page speed score then you’ll get lower cost per click rates because Google favors websites with better user experience and load times. And a faster loading website converts more traffic instead of wasting money on clicks who bailed before the site could load. If you’re starting to notice a pattern, a well built website is the center of a lot of it. It’s an investment. It’s the foundation of all your marketing efforts. \n\n…continued",

Posting daily with no clear goal, testing ads without enough budget or patience, or copying what bigger brands do without their margins or runway.

Some will unsubscribe because they consider it spam, others like it. I have social media platforms that I'm active on but haven't seen much traction there.",
