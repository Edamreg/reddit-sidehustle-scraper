Prior to that I had an $80 debit transaction I had accidentally put in as cash which was my first  and final strike.\n\nThe job market sucks rn and it took me 3 months to find this job that I was in for only 1 and 1/2. I have an apartment with me and my girl and we're both going to school. She's busting her ass and recently went part time from her overnight pca position in the hospital to focus on school, so I was suppose to hold us down for the meantime.\n\nI wasn't shocked when I got the call today since my manager told me about the incident yesterday. \nIm just in desperate need of some income, especially cause when I pay the bills this month I'll only have $200 to my name and that'll be for food and gas, etc.\n\nJust need some ideas that can put a little money into my pocket now or within a week or two.\n\n",

Work has been very slow for me lately!\n\nOn November 1st I created a post (with a different account) in my hometown‘s subreddit for **leaf raking**, offering to rake leaves for $20/hr CAD.  With one Reddit post, in under 2 weeks, I’ve had 6 customers for a total of 13 hours. People have been extremely generous paying anywhere from $25 to $40 an hour so far! \n\nNot a lot of hours yet, but very helpful when in need and I only needed a rake, bicycle, and cellphone to do it. \n\nDepending where you live, every season has work people will often pay well for. Here in Canada snow shovelling is a big one after the leaf raking is over. Anyone else try similar ideas?\n\nGood luck! 💵💰",

I have my masters in I/O Psychology and a background in HR, but I feel like my skills outside of that are…nonexistent. \n\nSince I’m pregnant, I know it’s not super feasible for me to find a job right now and still be able to afford childcare with this current job market. Im still trying but coming up short. My husband can afford most of the bills on his income but it will be tight and I’m hoping to at least help with groceries and expenses for the baby. \n\nHere are a few things about me:\n- I have a creative spirit but not the best at design. I can sometimes make a good template but I have no idea how to create designs otherwise (willing to learn if this is viable)\n- I’ve tried fiverr but I just am not sure what to sell on there and I don’t have a create copy of my work\n- I’m still too inexperienced to be a consultant in such a saturated field. Though, I’d love to be and again, not sure how. I’ve even looked into this one.\n- uber and doordash aren’t options for me…mostly due to safety concerns and anxiety\n- I also have no idea how to make a following for affiliate marketing or to make money from social media. I’m not sure what my content would be and the thought of getting in front of a camera gives me the ick\n- I love to critique and judge things, lol. Not sure if there’s a side hustle for that.\n- I love teaching and giving advice, but I don’t know where to start there since I can’t find a job doing this \n- I’ve considered selling some hr related templates on etsy but the set up fee is holding me back \n- I like to read? Anything here?\n- really not sure I have any special talents tbh \n",

Assisting homeowners with landscaping can pay $25 an hour. Babysitting dogs or walking them is $25 per dog per day. Elderly care (getting the mail, fixing them dinner) can be $30-50 per visit. Sooooo many options.\n\n\nBut don't stop there. You are in School? Then position yourself to apply your skills in more than one industry.\n\n\nMe, for example. I got a Bachelor's of Science. While in college, I tutored local high school kids in math. And I took Pre-med classes. Combining these skills let me bounce around after school in many different positions.\n\n\nToday, my main job in a hospital pays $30/HR and my side job tutoring college students pays $65-85 per hour. When I decide not to have a life, I can clear $10k in a month. Right now, though, Im doing less so I can have more time with my girlfriend. Anyway, think ahead and give yourself options.\n\n\nONE LAST THING. If possible, continue to live with Mom and Dad as long as you can. That allowed me to save for a house, which you can rent for an additional stream of income.",

My facility pays $4/hr for being on call at home, and time and a half if you're called in with 2 hours pay guaranteed even if the case is cancelled a second after you clock in.

I used to walk to the local grocery store and buy cases of soda and sell them out of my locker for a dollar a can. If I sold the case I tripled my money usually fwiw. \n\nI’d also sell things you’re no longer interested in. Old toys electronics collectibles. Especially electronics they lose value super quick when they start getting old. \n\nNow as an adult. I’ve hired my neighbors kids a few times for odd jobs like lawn mowing raking leaves hanging Xmas lights. Could always offer services to your neighbors or friends parents. Just be honest say you want to earn some and suggest some things they could benefit that you could do. It is leaf season atm easy job to make a few bucks on. \n\nIn the evenings between that I’d start that etsy store sell some patterns for your crochet and even offer the completed product. \n\nJust a few suggestions to get you started.

I’ve been trying to take a 50% deposit upfront, but not everyone is willing to. It’s hard to keep track, especially with some clients taking weeks to pay. Last month I completely forgot to invoice a customer, just totally spaced on it until they texted me asking for their invoice.\n\nAlso getting leads from nextdoor and facebook but half of them ghost after I send estimates. Takes me a day or two to respond usually because I'm at my day job. Had someone ask for a quote on replacing their deck boards last week, sent it that evening, they went with someone else the next morning.\n\nMy system right now is basically google sheets and hoping I remember everything, it's clearly not working anymore as I'm getting busier.\n\nWhat are you guys using to stay organized with this stuff?",

      "selftext": "Hey all, I'm needing some help with brainstorming ideas for extra income, ideally relatively quickly. I currently have a full time 40 hour a week job. It's normally Monday-Friday, 9-5, but some days I may have to work late, take evening calls, or take calls during the day on weekends. Because of that, I need a fairly flexible side hustle. My full time job absolutely comes first, every time. The good news is that I often have free time during my work day where I can't leave the building, but can work on personal projects as long as I have my regular work done. \n\nWhile I can pay all my bills with my current job, there's not much left over for me. I'm barely managing to have enough to get my medications, and I'm currently in physical therapy that I'm not sure how I'm going to pay for. That also means there's not really money for Christmas, or buying myself new clothes when I need them for work, vehicle repairs, helping my spouse with the grocery bill, etc. I also really want to work on paying off my credit card debts from when I was going through an exceptionally hard time.\n\nI tried Biolife and they could only get a good vein in one arm so they put me on deferral. I get one more try to see if they can stick me but after that it's a permanent deferral to my understanding. My right arm has a great vein, my left arm doesn't.\n\nMy car insurance will go up 100$ a month to cover me if I do something like Doordash, Instacart, or UberEats. I'm concerned that I won't be able to make enough to make it worth it after the insurance and gas. But I've also never done any freelance food delivery before, so maybe I'm selling short how much I'll make from that. If you could share your experience from that, it might help reassure me. I'm lucky that I'm in a major metro area, so I don't think I'd be short on work necessarily.\n\nI'm getting a seasonal job that I can work once a week at a place I've worked before. It's a little retail shop and fairly low-stress other than how much I have to be on my feet. Unfortunately, that'll only add another 100$ a week, give or take depending on exactly how much they schedule me. \n\nI'm working on opening an Etsy shop. I'm fairly creative and crafty and originally went to school for graphic design. I'm planning to do some reselling of antiques, keepsakes, limited edition items, and Youtuber merch that my spouse no longer wants. I'm also planning on selling door hangers (think \"do not open\"), pin back buttons, coasters, and kandi bracelets. My spouse will also be working with me to offer tarot readings and spell jars among other witchy things, as they have a lot of experience in those things. \n\nWould doing food delivery be worth it? Are there any other options that I'm not seeing? I know there are technically game/survey apps that pay that I could do at work when I'm not busy, but they pay so little or take so long to get paid that I'm not sure it would be worth my time.",

Like I said before I don’t have piles of books in my house, don't mail anything. I don’t even go to the post office.\n\nWhen someone does buys a book from my site, another company sends the book for me. They already have the books in their warehouse.\n\nIt's basically dropshipping, but for books.\n\nSomeone last week had a good question: why would someone buy from me instead of Amazon?\n\nThink about this for a minute, Amazon sells everything; iphones, books, pretty much anything you want. But if you look in your local home town store someone selling the same item on Amazon but they decided to buy it there, same concept.\n\nI only pick books I love like creativity, big ideas, travel, philosophy, stuff like that. Some people like that instead of scrolling forever through Amazon.\n\nAnd the last one I saw was do you need Shopify, but the thing I use, there is the app for it.\n\nI think that was all the comments, I don't think I was missing anything but if you have anymore questions, let me know.",

      "selftext": "A couple of years ago, I kind of stumbled into something I didn’t plan at all. I just wanted a small side project to do outside of work, and nothing serious, just a creative outlet. Instagram was honestly the last place I thought I’d make money.\n\n\n\nIt started super random. I had this tiny hobby account where I posted aesthetic desk setups and productivity stuff I found online. One post blew up out of nowhere, and followers started rolling in. Then someone DMed me asking if I could post their product on my story and offered $20. That was my “wait… people actually pay for this??” moment.\n\n\n\nI got curious and made a few more accounts in different niches, like quotes, lifestyle, cozy home decor, that kind of stuff. Nothing huge, but I started noticing patterns: which content got engagement, what time posts hit best, and what types of followers brands were after.\n\n\n\nEventually, I teamed up with two friends to handle more pages. I thought it'd make things easier, but managing 20+ accounts quickly turned into chaos: constant logins/logouts, getting flagged as bots, and even losing accounts because Instagram thought we were sketchy. On top of that, I started worrying about losing control over these accounts, since we were sharing passwords, any single leak could put all my accounts and earnings at risk. So I needed a way to keep full control over my own accounts without compromising teamwork.\n\n\n\nThat's when I got smarter about the setup. My friends and I used Canva for posts (none of us were Photoshop pros), Later for scheduling, CapCut and InShot for Reels, and AdsPower to keep everything separated. It helped a lot with security, no more device confusion or accidental cross-logins, and the teamwork feature let me assign roles and permissions without having to share logins directly.\n\n\n\nI wouldn’t call it “passive” in the beginning cuz it was a grind. But once things were set up, a lot started running on autopilot. Some of our old pages still bring in cash from story promos, affiliate links, or the occasional account sale to someone who wants a head start.\n\n\n\nHere’s what I’ve learned:\n\n• “Soft” niches (quotes, lifestyle, cute pets, productivity) are way easier to grow and monetize than most people think.\n\n• Consistency &gt; creativity when you’re starting out.\n\n• And seriously, once you scale, security and organization are everything.\n\n\n\nIt’s not a get-rich-quick thing, but it’s been a solid little side income for something that started as me just posting random aesthetic pics in my free time.",

Almost every business today needs video content for marketing, whether it is Instagram reels, TikTok shorts, YouTube videos, or website promos. The demand is huge and growing.\n\nYou don’t need to be a filmmaker. You can learn basic editing in a week. The only part most beginners struggle with is doing voiceovers, but that problem is basically solved now because you can use AI voiceover tools and get clean, natural narration without recording anything yourself.\n\nOnce you know how to put together short promotional videos, product demos, before-and-after videos, or service explainers, you can sell monthly content bundles to small businesses. For example:\n\n10 short videos per month  \n2 long videos per month  \nA full video reel pack  \nSocial media formatted clips\n\nBusinesses love it because they need fresh content constantly, and you can deliver it quickly once you have a workflow. This skill is simple, fast to learn, and can become steady income because businesses often stay with you month after month.\n\nI also explain how to make voiceovers easily in my newsletter, link in my bio if you want more details.",

          "body": "I've been making a couple hundred each month just by looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than the cost. It's called bonus arbitrage. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

However it surprised me because I ended up getting email notifications that I would have commission of $50 for a month, and then it slowly started ramping up to $80-$90ish, and now it’s running in the low to mid hundreds. This really surprised me but I kid you guys not I genuinely (almost) forgot about my novel and it’s now pulling me a few hundred a month completely “passive”. Like, I do zero promotion or any effort for it, but it’s somehow being recommended to people in the marketplace.\n\ncrazy how sometimes these things work out in the strangest ways, but that just shows that earning passive income isn’t always through an obvious path… \n\nhope this inspires anyone else. just thought I’d share lol ",

Some of my best passive income successes in the past have been from dipping my spoon into the broader market, but I’d be hesitant to lean into it right now given the number of states that are enacting ID laws for accessing porn sites, which might as well be a porn ban. Likewise, at this point, there’s very little to stop the Project 2025 vision of making porn illegal within the next year a reality, and I would not be at all surprised if any businesses considered to be abetting the distribution of pornography to be held liable as well.\n \nSo, ignoring any moral objections you may have, strictly in terms of what’s going to be best for your business over the next three years or more, I don’t think leaning into it is the way. Maybe ten years ago but not in this budding dystopia we’re rolling into. If it were me, I’d monitor them to make sure they aren’t promoting or fronting for some truly rancid stuff, but leaning towards cutting quick if their presence is providing little relative benefit or limiting growth.

Amazon warehouse employees are at least paid but treated horrendously and not allowed to take bathroom breaks. Most restaurants use undocumented labor for their kitchen staff, which is not bad in my opinion, but as a result they often pay less than minimum wage which is morally wrong. Unfortunately, I could go on forever. In fact, I don’t know if I can name an industry that is 100% morally sound. \n\nA lot of modern porn is actually not too bad in terms of ethics. Obviously there are certainly porn sites that are not morally sound at all and some that violate legality. But a lot of popular modern porn sites are not only ethical, but empowering for the content creators! I feel like porn faced heavy scrutiny in the 2010’s after the documentary ‘Hot Girls Wanted’ exposed how awful it was, and as a result it has been reformed for the better.  Only Fans and Fansly for example, allows their creators freedom/control over their content, work conditions, and a very equitable share of the generated profits! The top 10% of creators on those sites likely make 6 figures, have full creative control over what type of content they make, and are protected from workplace harassment. It also can be a safe space, and excellent platform for lgbtqia people to not only express their sexuality, but monetize if. \n\nAgain, I’m sure there are definitely porn sites that are unethical, but I would go out on a limb and say that currently, porn is the most ethical that it has ever been, and is far from the worst industry. I would feel much worse about being involved in the real estate broker/foreclosure, predatory/payday loan, or healthcare industries than porn.",

Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

      "selftext": "Forget building elaborate automated systems. My actual goal was far simpler: I just wanted to stop micro-managing every single one of my side hustles.\n\nMy first foray into automation began with a basic reminder. I simply scheduled a weekly alert for Fridays to relist a handful of Etsy products that were losing visibility. This minimal effort, taking barely two minutes, proved surprisingly effective at preventing a significant drop in traffic.\n\nNext, I integrated auto-scheduling for Pinterest. I simply took my existing designs, configured them to loop every few weeks, and pushed them out. There was no specific optimization. Yet, these automatically recycled posts began generating a consistent flow of clicks.\n\nMy next step involved a more technical approach: I developed a simple script to programmatically reindex older blog pages via Google’s API. While it sounds complex, its primary purpose was to automate a task I disliked performing manually. Once confirmed operational, I promptly ceased thinking about it.\n\nThis pattern became a clear directive, every instance of successful automation stemmed from a reluctance to perform repetitive, unstimulating tasks manually.\n\nSo now, the Etsy listings just auto-renew, the pins repost themselves, the old pages get reindexed... and this little ecosystem just keeps generating a handful of random sales or clicks each week. It's never anything massive, but it totally adds up, enough for coffee, a nice little rent buffer, and honestly, a whole lot of peace of mind.\n\nEveryone out there talks about 'passive income' like it's this glorious, sprawling system you build once and then, boom, you retire to a beach. For me? It's way more like a messy pile of half-automated chores that just quietly chug along in the background while I'm off doing literally anything else.\n\nIt's undoubtedly chaotic, lacking any aesthetic appeal, and occasionally requires troubleshooting. Yet, its consistent contribution to my rent makes it entirely satisfactory.\n\n",

Affiliate marketing can work when you actually have content what people like to read or watch. So, you need to improve your skills there and think about the audience again.

          "body": "You can try bonus arbitrage, which can probably make you a couple hundred each month. Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

Most places help pay for the certifications, if not sometimes family members don't mind helping pay for the certifications if it means a good job and someone in the house knowing emergency care\n\n3)Thrifting resale. Tons of people do it and if you study up or have a knack for fashion or a closet to clear out. Ask family and friends if anyone needs help with garage sales or putting up decorations.

At 16, you’re not in a position to “get money for free” as passive income always seems to suggest. The only way that passive income works, if it’s not scamming other people, is if the thing you’re selling is providing a huge longterm benefit. Such a thing usually requires large investments, years of work, etc. If you could have that at 16, everybody would do it and the value would quickly diminish.\n\nAlso, imo if you get a regular brain dead job and just save that money to invest it in financial products, you’ll be way better off than trying any sort of business. Especially at your age, all investors will tell you: the biggest and safest factor is time, they all wish they’d started saving earlier.",

That's not enough time to try even one way for long enough (as in, to get good enough at it).\n\nWhat you are experiencing is the valuable lesson of failure, one that every entrepreneur will have to face in their life. It comes with the even more valuable lesson of dealing with frustration and anxiety, two key skills in business.\n\nMy pieces of advice are: focus on one thing and go all in; connect with people that know how to do that thing better than you do and learn as much as you can from them; partner up with people whose skills compliment your own.\n\nFor instance, I'm a tax lawyer. I learned my core skill through 10 years of service in big law. After I left, I partnered up with another lawyer that is very good at tax litigation, an auditor and a CPA to be able to deliver the complete service. We have another partner whose focus is strictly corporate sales and a consultant for business intelligence and AI. We're looking for a specialist in digital marketing right now, since our strategy is in need of a digital marketplace wiz.\n\nGoing at business alone, with no/low capital and no skills is the recipe for failure on top of which \"get rich scheme\" internet bozos thrive of.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been working online for over 10 years, and during this time, I’ve noticed a clear pattern among people who never make any real money — it almost always comes down to their mindset.\n\nHere are 7 types of people who almost never make money online (and why):\n\n# ‍1. The Information Collectors\n\nThey love learning, but never apply anything. They watch every YouTube video, download every freebie, and maybe even buy a few courses — but never actually finish or implement them.\n\n**The Problem:** They confuse learning with doing.\n\n**Fix:** Pick *one* business model and take consistent action on it for 90 days — no switching.\n\n# 2. The Shiny Object Chasers\n\nThey jump from one idea to another. One week it’s Amazon KDP, next week it’s affiliate marketing, then dropshipping, then AI prompts…\n\n**The Problem:** They’re always chasing what looks easiest or newest.\n\n**Fix:** Commit to *one* model until you’re profitable. Every business works — if *you* work it.\n\n# 3. The “No-Time” Excusers\n\nThey always say, “I don’t have time.” Yet they spend hours scrolling social media or binge-watching Netflix.\n\n**The Problem:** They underestimate what they can do in 1 focused hour per day.\n\n**Fix:** Schedule non-negotiable work blocks. Even 45 minutes daily compounds massively over a year.\n\n# 4. The Freebie Hunters\n\nThey refuse to invest a dollar. They want to build a business using only free tools and free info.\n\n**The Problem:** When you get something for free, you don’t value it.\n\n**Fix:** Be willing to invest — in tools, learning, and systems that save time or accelerate results.\n\n# 5. The Fearful Perfectionists\n\nThey wait for everything to be perfect before launching. Whether it’s a blog, product, or YouTube channel — they keep editing, tweaking, and never publishing.\n\n**The Problem:** Perfectionism is procrastination in disguise.\n\n**Fix:** Launch messy. Improve as you go. The market teaches faster than theory.\n\n# 6. The Overthinkers\n\nThey analyze everything to death. They spend weeks deciding on a niche or a logo instead of creating something.\n\n**The Problem:** They’re paralyzed by too many “what ifs.”\n\n**Fix:** Make quick decision, and take small actions. You can’t steer a parked car — start moving and refine as you go.\n\n# 7. The Instant Gratification Seekers\n\nThey expect quick money. If they don’t see results in 2 weeks, they quit and call it a scam. \n\n**The Problem:** They treat online business like a lottery, not a long-term skill.\n\n**Fix:** Think in *years*, not weeks. The internet rewards those who stick around long enough to learn what works.\n\nHave you ever caught yourself stuck in one of these traps?",

          "body": "I have been using the Vibecode app for a bit, so here is a straight answer.\nVibecode is more than a UI mockup tool. It generates actual mobile apps using React Native and Expo under the hood, and you can run them on your phone, not just click through static screens.\nI built a small mobile MVP with it that had email based login, saved user data, simple logic like tracking streaks and progress, and a couple of external API calls with basic tracking. That was enough to share the app with real users and collect feedback. All of that was done inside Vibecode without opening a traditional code editor.\nFrom what I have seen, it does well when your app is fairly straightforward. Things like auth, basic CRUD, simple conditions, and a few APIs are very doable. When you start asking for more unusual or complex workflows, it takes more effort to get what you want, and it helps a lot if you already understand how apps and data flows work.\nSo to answer the original question in practical terms:\nYes, Vibecode can build a real, functional mobile app, not just a visual prototype. It is a solid option if you want to get an MVP on a phone quickly and see how users react. If the app grows and you need heavy custom logic or long term maintainability, you will probably end up refining the generated code or bringing in a more traditional setup later, but that is a next step, not a blocker for getting started.",

Launches fast. The only issue I have is that edge cases and hyper custom logic sometimes needs tweaking after the app generates it, but that's honestly expected... You're not locked into what it outputs though as you can export and edit if needed.\n\nFor an MVP? Really freakin' solid. You'll have something real in days. The question is whether you want to spend time customizing stuff after or if the initial build is 80% of what you need anyway. You can then use vibe coders like Claude or Gemini Pro (hell, even GPT5 is decent) to finish the rest. \n\nBiggest thing I'd say is, try it for your specific use case first. Some app ideas are perfect for AI builders, others need custom development. But you'll know pretty quick once you start building.\n\nHope that helps.",

The people running the ads may have deals directly with the influencers or companies and be paying you a % of what they get paid. You can go viral with skill or luck and make decent money. Big viral clip channels can easily make tens of thousands per month. But 99% of people would be lucky to make $5/month uploading hundreds of clips.",

I see some people get millions of views and only paid like $50. I've seen others receive a fraction of that and make a lot more money. And by see, I mean those are the claims in the Discord. \n\nOne of them, from what I gather, is based on percentage. If their client pays $1000 to them, they may keep $100 and split the remaining $900 amongst all the people in the campaign. So if you and I are the solo campaigners, and we each have equal views, we would see around $450 each. But if I have 90% of the views, I might get $800 and you get $100. If you add more people to the campaign, everyone's potential profits drop. Does that make sense? \n\nI am a good video editor so I am going to give it a shot. I need about a week to get setup with some thing first, and then we will see.",

I made 1500 last month, 2300 the month prior, and 2700 the month prior to that. (I just realized I have spent a lot of that now that I am typing again so I need to save my money lmao.)

Then I adjust the messaging — add a specific hook, refocus the clip for a certain audience, or mix in a CTA.\n\nIt’s not about cutting trending videos that everyone else uses — it’s about repurposing content you’ve already made in a way that feels platform-native and clear.\n\nThat’s how content creators and marketers actually save time.",

      "selftext": "so I want to share just an idea of mine for making money, this is just a theoretical idea, I did NOT test it and not sure if you really can make money with it, theoretically you should be able...\n\nI’m sure all of us get a lot of spam emails... a cousin from Nigeria that left you some big money, you're a winner of some kind of lottery, Bitcoin earning... and many of them... and all of these spam emails either want you to download something (never do not download) OR just want you to send them something, like photo of bank account, credit card... or other things.\n\nso my idea is related to those spam emails that expect from you some response with files/images...\n\nI like to call it \"spam a spammer\"\n\nso like steps to do:\n\n1. Create a totally new email account (gmail I think is the best, and never do NOT use your real email)\n2. Expose your email publicly, so like write your email on any kind of forum, blogs... everywhere... so main idea here is for spammer parsers to find your email and just include it in their spam list. Here you could focus on niche, like expose email just on money maker forums for example\n3. Find some affiliate network that offers Pay Per Download, so if someone will download via your affiliate link - you earn money\n4. Upload to that affiliate network a couple of files, like image/png, pdf... and most important give them a real name like Fullname Password front, Bank account statement... and so on... so like to look like a real one\n5. The most important... for your email create a vacation autoreply to all, and here just create a nice message but not like a vacation reply, but to look more real, like replying to a real email... so like thank you, I’m glad I finally won something bla bla... and like in the end attach all the links to the affiliate downloaded files... so like to mention, here are my password front photo... here is my bank statement... so main idea is for the spammer to really think that you believed him and you sent him back real info\n\n...and then just wait for results... I mean you could just forget about these emails... it will work automatically for you\n\nso again, this is just one of my theoretical ideas that I’m not even sure will work at all...\n\nmaybe here someone will want to try or maybe tried something before and wants to share thoughts on this...",

          "body": "You can try bonus arbitrage, which can probably make you a couple hundred each month. Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

But here's what i see college students doing successfully.. they're starting service businesses that don't need much upfront capital. Things like pressure washing, window cleaning, or even just basic handyman services if you're handy.\n\nThe passive income thing though... that's where people get stuck. Nothing is truly passive when you're starting out, everything needs your time and attention first. I had one client who started a vending machine route with about 3k, but even that required him driving around restocking and fixing machines constantly. Maybe look into something you can build while in school that could eventually run without you? Service businesses can get there once you hire people, but you gotta do the work yourself first.",

This gives you your 6 hours of work, with the unpaid lunch break.\n\n As for the 15s, I know different states have different rules, depending on the hours worked. In MA, you get one paid 15 if you work 4 hours, a paid 15 and an unpaid 30 at 6 hours and two paid 15s and an unpaid 30 at 8 hours.  \n\nYou'd probably have to check with HR about how those get scheduled.\n\nBest of luck!  😁",

      "selftext": "Another month, another update for my tool site [terrific.tools](http://terrific.tools/) \\- here's the [previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1o3uees/im_building_a_tool_site_month_10_update/) one.\n\nAfter eleven months of launching the project, it is finally taking shape. \n\nIn my last post, I wrote that I was accepted into Mediavine's PubNation program. Ads, as you can see, are now live on the site and have been for about 10 days.\n\nSo far, the RPMs are abysmal, only getting around $4 session RPM. I was hoping for $10 but this seems a bit far fetched for now.\n\nThat said, RPMs should increase as Mediavine continues to optimize ad placement and I hopefully continue to increase traffic. \n\nI am in their lowest rev share tier (75%) right now and this can get as high as 90%. \n\nBut in order to hit those tiers, I will have to significantly increase traffic - and I have done a bad job at that this month.\n\nMonthly traffic is still at 31k sessions, so no increase since the last update. \n\nWith the desktop app and especially with ads, this is all about scaling traffic (assuming I retain the same share of tier 1 country visitors). \n\nFor November, the tool site will probably make around $300 with sales of the app and ads. Idea is to reinvest every cent the side project makes into linkbuilding and maybe a few YouTube sponsorships (for the desktop app) down the line. \n\nStarting this, I always knew that it would be a 10 year side project and that the first few years would be somewhat slow.\n\nBut with ads now live, I am more confident than ever that I'll eventually get this to $10k in monthly revenue!",

          "body": "$4 session RPM doesn’t seem bad at all, but honestly despite constantly researching the terms used to calculate ad revenue I still find all of it extremely confusing. Would session RPM be roughly converted to page RPM by diving by average pages per session? So if your session RPM is $4, and users view 2 pages on average, your page RPM is $2? If they viewed 4 pages it would be $1, and so on? I run a tool based site as well (mine are image generators more for entertainment, not practical tools like yours, but I think on-site user behavior would still be similar). I’d love to compare numbers if you’re interested to see how our ad metrics compare. I really have no point of reference for if mine are good or bad - every source online cites wildly different averages.",

At first glance, it doesn't make much sense and is full of paradox. But there more you read and re-read it, the more you understand it.\n\nIn the west, we really believe that grit, hard work and individual brilliance determine outcomes. The Tao Te Ching suggests that individual success is underpinned by aligning ourselves with the patterns of the existence, in entrepreneurship it's aligning ourselves with the flow of current and future economic patterns. \n\nWhat you choose to work on and timing, has 1000X more impact than how hard you work or how brilliant you are. An engineer can spend 1000 hours building the next bitcoin and generate literal trillions of value, or can spend the same 1000 hours on a project that is never sees the light of day. Build bitcoin too early and there's no interest, too late and it exists.\n\nIt's not a business book but gives you a completely new lens to look at the world.",

Here are a list of books (in no particular order) that I've found useful that have helped me in my journey in building my businesses (NOTE: I am close to my liquidity event, so a lot of my current research revolves around what to do with the cash from my exit in my family office. I should walk away, after tax, with low/mid 9-figures.): \n\nAny of the Rich Dad/Poor Dad Series by Robert Kiyosaki: Great for mindset and understanding how money and business works.\n\nMultifamily Millionaire (vol 1 and 2) by Brandon Turner, et. al.  Great for understanding real estate and how it really works. \n\nThe Due Diligence Handbook for Commercial Real Estate by Brian Hennessey: Understanding what to look for in buying CRE. \n\nFamily Wealth by James E. Hughes, jr. How to deal with wealth over generations (yes, I know most of you are not at this point, but it's good to start with the mindset of \"I'm already wealthy and so I'll start acting and behaving in that manner now\"). \n\nThe 10X Rule by Grant Cardone. Mindset and focus (yes, I know Cardone is either loved or hated. I feel neither way towards him. I'd never invest with him in his real estate ventures, but there are lessons in this book).\n\nThe encyclopedia of Real Estate Advice by Terry Painter: Understanding better how real estate and works and why it's important to buy assets and not liabilities.\n\nThe Internet of Money by Andreas M. Antonopoulos. Read the entire series. It's eye opening.\n\nThe Big Print by Lawrence Lepard. Truly understand the shell game that is money. Once you understand it and realize that you are NOT going to change the game, you can focus on profiting from the game (the game you can not change).\n\nThe Almanack of Naval Ravikant by Eric Jorgenson. Great insights!\n\n\n\"Relentless\" and \"Winning\" by Tim Grover. Serious motivation on what it takes to succeed at a high level. I relisten to these at least every year or two.\n\nThe Creative Dealmaker by Carl Allen. How to do 'buy and build' businesses. Why fuck around with a start up (since most fail), why not target an already successful business that you can take to a higher level.\n\nThe 1% Rule by Tommy Baker. If everything is a priority, then nothing is a priority. How to hyper focus on the most important things that move your business and your life forward\n\nNegotiation Genuis by Deepak Malhorta and Max Bazerman: Learn how to negotiate\n\nPeak by Robert Pool and Anders Ericsson: How to master the skills that matter for your success\n\nThe Bitcoin Standard by Saifadean Ammous. 3/4 of the book is about understanding money and how the economy really works and the role bitcoin might play in that moving forward. One of the best books I've read this year.\n\nThe Blue Ocean Strategy by W. Chan Kim. Get out of the red ocean and find/create a blue ocean. This is the mindset whether you're starting a business or buying an existing business\n\nThe Big Rich by Bryan Burroughs. True story of the Texas oil boom and what happened to those involved.  Completely worth a read...filled with life and business lessons.\n\nAcquisitional Wealth by Josh Tolley: How to buy an existing business and grow it. \n\nThe Art of Selling your Business by John Warrilow: Start with the end in mind.\n\nRead everything that Pat Lencione writes.\n\nBuy Then Build by Walker Diebel: Why risk a start up...buy an existing business. This book teaches you what to look for and how to do it.\n\nRead Adam Coffey's books, Empire Builder, The Exit Strategy Playbook, The Private Equity Playbook.\n\nThe Trillion Dollar Coach by Eric Schmidt: Just read it...NOW.\n\nAngel Investing by David Rose: You need to understand the game of raising capital no matter what side of the table you're sitting on. This gives you insight into the buy side (angel investor side) of the table. You better understand their mindset\n\nAngel by Jason Calacanis. Understanding Angel Investing. Whether you're an Angel or seeking Angel money, you need to understand the game.\n\nThe Power Law by Sebastian Mallaby: Again, understanding the game of angel, VC and PE. \n\nHigh Output Management by Andy Grove. High level stuff, but worth a read so you can understand what your COO/Operations person is doing and how to build a great team.\n\nThe Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz: Just read it.\n\nThe Path Between the Seas by David McCullough. Why would I recommend a story about the building of the Panama Canal? Because it's one the best books I've ever read and it's filled with life and business lessons. Plus, no matter how bad you think you've got it...no matter how difficult your problems seem...they are NOTHING compared to what these men (and women) went through to make engineering marvel become a reality.\n\nTitan by Ron Chernow: Biography of Rockefeller. So worth the read.\n\nMellon by David Canadine. One of the greatest men of the gilded age...whether you like him or now.\n\nThe Power Broker by Robert Caro: If you want to understand how politics works...if you want to understand the two pillars that drive everything in the world (Power and Money)...then read this book. It may be the best book I've ever read.\n\nThe LBJ biography series by Robert Caro. The BEST biographical series I've ever read. LBJ was Caro's hero. As Caro learned...never meet your hero. LBJ is (IMHO) the greatest politician in the history of America. And I say that as someone who things he's one of the worst presidents ever. If you truly want to understand politics...read this fucking series NOW. The section on \"Box 13\" is MINDBLOWING.\n\nThe House of Morgan by Ron Chernow. Understand how a great business was built that changed the world.\n\nSo far in 2025, I've read/listened to almost 200 books at least once. In 2024, I listened to and/or read 150 books. This is a partial list of books that I found worthwhile over the last 23 months. \n\nI hope there is a gem or two in this list for the group.",

I was listening to a podcast (dont remember who) years ago and this woman name Dr Carol Robin created a successful course called touchy feely that helps people develop better communication and leadership skills. She wrote a book on it called Connect and said she hopes it sells well but wasnt sure because you can't just read the book and develop those skills. It ended up not selling well based on the number of Amazon reviews and you really need to be in a classroom with a bunch of people to talk to for it to work. \n\n\nI'm not saying books are a waste of time but people really need to apply themselves with what the book teaches which can usually involve a lot more work than people want to do. I actually think there's probably a lot of good YouTube channels that can help people succeed but its hard to filter through them to find the good ones. Some of them are actually successful and some only talk about being successful hoping their YouTube channel will take off so they can sell courses on how they did it or something lol. ",

      "selftext": "It's a dumb question. You're not dumb, just maybe uninformed, which I will rectify shortly. But the question is very, very dumb.\n\nFirst off, people who ask \"what business should I start?\" are really asking \"how can I make a lot of money?\"\n\nStraight up, starting a business is a crappy way to make a lot of money. Statistically most people lose money. You're probably going to lose money. So, if you want to make a lot of money, get into management consulting or ibanking, which generally means getting an MBA. Have fun with that.\n\nSecondly, people who ask \"what business should I start?\" generally think that businesses are fungible, which means they're a commodity or easily swapped out with one another. This, btw, is why most businesses fail. Because people think that businesses are just this thing that you start and money comes out the other end.\n\nIf I said a great business is rolling up a bunch of dentist practices, would you know what to do with that? Like, do you have dentistry experience? Do you have PE experience rolling up companies? If the answer is no to both, don't fucking roll up a bunch of dentist practices. It requires skills you don't have.\n\nIf I said, \"ooh! ooh! ooh! AI, baby! AI is gonna change everything,\" are you especially good at AI? If you're not, then one school of thought would say that AI is a growing market, so you should learn AI and sell those services to other people. There's another school of thought that says every fucking person and their grandmother is learning AI right now so they can sell  services to other people and I really wonder what you are going to discover about AI that's going to make you better than my grandma.\n\nLastly, markets aren't interchangeable either.\n\nI spent nearly 30 years starting tech companies. Had a few successes and a bunch of failures. Now, I'm a world-class startup coach. I do that job exceptionally well, I have great word of mouth, make a lot of money. And when I started, I knew A LOT of people in several startup ecosystems. My access to that market helped me get off the ground and eventually scale this business.\n\nIf I decided to start a company selling shit to celebrities, I would fail. I would 100% fail. Why? I don't know any celebrities. I don't have access to that market and I'd probably run out of money and time before I figured out how to get celebrities' attention.\n\nStop asking what business you should start. They aren't lego bricks.\n\nHere's a much better question to ask yourself: what do I love to do?\n\nFind something you love to do. Get good at it. Prove that you're good at it by selling your services to other people, either as an employee or a contractor. Get promoted and get a great title. Or become a consultant, which is just a contractor who charges a shit ton of money.\n\nGet so good at what you love that you know things about your job and market that no one else knows about. Understand secrets about your industry that give you a fundamentally unfair advantage over everyone else. Even my grandmother.\n\nThen go start a business using that knowledge. That's the business you should start.\n\nEDIT: random spelling and grammatical errors. I type for shit.",

          "body": "I disagree. \n\nYou are speaking from the perspective of someone who has been in business for decades, but most of the people who ask these questions have never built their own thing. They might have fantasized about it, but they are either still in school or are shackled by a 9 to 5.\n\n  \nStarting a business is really hard. It is scary, risky, and almost everyone you know with a 9 to 5 will deride you for the decision.\n\nAnd one of the ways to make the journey easier is to build a community around you where you feel supported and advised.\n\nSo, when I see someone ask, \"What should I start?\", I am seeing someone who is scared to take the plunge and is trying to dip their toe. I see someone who is trying to diffuse their risk by asking for advice from more seasoned individuals.\n\nThat said, my main gripes are:\n\n1. I don't mind you asking, but I do mind you failing to execute on it. At the end of the day, you just have to take the leap, especially if you are still starting out. \n\n2. It is okay to ask for advice, but at the end of the day, you have to make up your own mind, and if you fail, you can't blame anyone else but yourself. In other words, don't start a business because others told you to, start it because you believe in it.\n\n3. Building a business is a marathon, not a sprint. There are no shortcuts, no viral hacks, and no expert tactics to help you leapfrog the competition. You need to put in a ton of elbow grease and understand that the best quality you can have is grit.\n\nSo, my perspective is ask for advice but then do something about it.",

      "selftext": "I started an E-commerce website selling activities and tours on the island I live on in Hawaii about 3 years ago as a side hustle. Don’t get me wrong I’ve been an entrepreneur since I was in high school. Mostly re-selling. Some side hustles made money and some did not. Some just wasn’t worth the time. This side hustle finally paid off. I quit my full time job back in February 2025 and have made $113K in profits (net) so far in 2025. Hopping to hit $150k in profits by the end of the year with the Thanksgiving &amp; Christmas rush.\n\nJust wanted to say, if you’ve tried and failed, like I have multiple times. Don’t give up! \n\nI’m hoping to expand my business to other islands in Hawaii and yes I’m definitely “scared” but you never know unless you give it a try. ",

But imagine I can work from home on my own business while spending time and caring for my kid. That'd absolutely be my biggest dream. Otherwise I'd be working from 8-6 without seeing them much. Heck, maybe I will make enough money to sustain our family, so that my wife can help me out with the business and we can both work from home. Or she can continue working 1 or 2 days a week at her job if she wants to. \n\nMaybe I'm not being realistic, but a man can dream and I'm working hard to try and make that dream a reality lol.",

      "selftext": "Hey, I need some real talk from anyone who’s been burned by a \"partner.\" This is a tough situation for me.\n\nI'm a young dev, still in high school, but I'm the single technical brain behind everything this company does. My boos, let's call him \"visionary man\", is all sales and big promises. I'm the one who built the whole stack: Rust/Node APIs, Tauri/React desktop apps, manages all the servers, load balancing, database. I literally build all the engine for all high-stake client projects.\n\nThe amount of work done is huge, the pressure is constant, but the pay is nonexistent. For months, our Whatsapp chat has been a broken record: me begging for my weekly pay, and him giving the excuses: \"I'm at zero\", \"waiting for money to come in,\" or just to busy flying around. To keep me motivated, he only keeps talking up about the future, how we'll \"get rich\" later with his next big project ,and that I just need to be patient.\n\nThe whole thing blew up recently. He's obsessed with this personal project, and when it slowed down because I was actually focusing on my school and personal stuff, he went off on me. He accused me of not being dedicated, compared me to his own insane workload. He then threatened my financial stake: he warned that if he has to invest more of his own money to keep his pet project moving, **the whole percentage picture changes.**\n\nThis is the bottom line: I built the business assets, but he treat my labor like free capital, and now he's threatening my future.\n\nI need some advice of what decision should take, i don't have any experience with this things. What would an experienced entrepreneur do?\n\nI'd be happy to answer any questions and provide more information about the situation, without revealing any personal details about the project or the company.\n\nSorry for my bad english, it's not my native language.\n\n\\[IMPORTANT EDIT\\]\n\nThank you for all the advice you've given me in this post. I think there were many details I didn't mention because I assumed they were obvious (obviously my mistake).\n\n* I'm 16 years old\n* I live in Venezuela\n* I never signed a contract to work for this person\n* I don't have legal permission to work\n* My boss has government connections, so it's unlikely I'd win in a legal battle.",

          "body": "Listen, you’ve done great. At 17, you’ve already built a whole platform, written the code, designed the architecture - something that grown-up companies spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on. That is your intellectual property.\n\nNow let’s get to the point. You’ve made a common mistake of many young guys - you trusted words instead of putting things on paper. Business is not about “trusting someone’s word,” business is about agreements that are legally documented.\n\nWhen there is no contract, no share agreement, no act of completed work - legally, it looks like you just “helped voluntarily.” And now your “partner” is using that against you.\n\n**Here is what I would advise you:**\n\n1. **Stop working for free.** If someone doesn’t respect you as a partner, don’t give them your work for nothing. Free work kills respect.\n2. **Document what you have built.** Save the code, structure, repositories, architecture - everything that proves you are the creator. Make a backup. This is your intellectual property.\n3. **Talk calmly but firmly.** Say: “I appreciate what we built together, but I can’t keep working without payment and clear terms. Either we sign an agreement about shares and compensation, or I step away from the project.” No emotions, just a clear, adult conversation.\n4. **Don’t be afraid to walk away.** You’re young, and you have many opportunities ahead. One toxic ‘visionary’ doesn’t define your future. It’s better to lose an illusionary share in a bad project than to lose time and self-respect.\n5. **Learn the lesson.** Real partnership means both sides contribute something valuable - one brings money, the other brings skills - but it must be formalized. Friendship is friendship, but business is business.\n\n**Most importantly:** don’t be bitter. This isn’t a failure, it’s your first business lesson.  \nWe’ve all gone through something like this. The main thing is not to lose faith in yourself and never let anyone use your talent for free.",

Spend some cathartic time talking with friends about what an asshole he was.\n\nFirst thing first.  Cut your losses.  If you control the product, shut it down, take it away, break the code.  Whatever.  Make sure he doesn't get anything else from you.  End the relationship, take anything you can get easily and be done.\n\nSecond thing.  Make a list of the things you keep from this negative experience.  I've lost money and huge amounts of time to a bad partner.  BUT, the work I did, the knowledge I gained, the lessons I learn and take away are mine no matter what.  No one can take this away from you.  You have skills, abilities and lessons that will forever be yours.\n\nThird thing.  Focus on these good things that came out of this shitty situation.   There are many like listed above.  These are the ways you become wise and experienced.   They set you apart.   Bad outcomes at an early age shape you and give you wisdom your contemporaries don't have.   Spend time understanding and processing these good things.\n\nMy take away from my bad partner was to not have partners.  I will always own my companies 100% or with my wife.  A partner is effectively like chosing a wife.  It is that important.  Problem is, you'll never know your partner well enough.  I understand that it is difficult to build a business alone so I'm happy to have employees, contractors, etc help, but not a partner.  I believe that reciprocal service contracts are the solution if required.  My business helps your business, we exchange services according to a year to year contract (\"evergreen contract continues until a decision to stop\").  This way, when a situation comes up where your contractual partner behaves in an untenable way, the contract is severed, but the business is preserved.\n\nSorry about your situation.  Sorry your partner took advantage of you.  Learn, grow and prosper.",

It’s about paper, performance, and ownership. Take the hit, walk away smarter, and don’t ever let someone make you feel ‘lucky’ to work for free again.",

Prepare yourself to say / write whatever is true and professional. This is a good lesson at your age. It’s never too early to stand up for yourself without anger or aggression. Say it like it is. It’s a mistake to assume that being nice and agreeable is good for the relationship. Be truthful and kind, but also direct and say the thing that’s uncomfortable. “The company has an asset because of me. I believe I am entitled to more ownership if I’m not being paid. That would be fair. Ideally we would have determined ownership by the value each founder is bringing to the table.” Say it in the mirror 100 times 100 different ways.\n\n5.

          "body": "So, there's a **lot** to unpack here, and there's a **lot** of information missing. \n\n\nFirst things first, then: Everything here is going to be wobbly, for a few reasons. You've stated that English isn't your primary language, which *generally* indicates that you are not in the United States. Most people on Reddit (including myself) are US residents, so our thoughts are going to be strongly influenced by customs, laws, and business practices prevalent here in the US. You will need to compare anything here against what standards exist where you live. In other words, take this as general advice, not specific guidance. \n\n\nSecondly, you stated you are still in high school. That adds depth to the legal and business standards \"wobble\", because so many legal rights are contingent on your age. \n\n\nThird and last, there's a significant factor missing from the equation, independent of the first two - how is your business structured. You mentioned a partner, but there's very little (essentially, none) mentioned about how your business is organized - both practical and legal. One guy does the relationship stuff, one guy does the technical stuff.\n\n\nSo, with all of that out of the way, I am going to approach this from the perspective that you are of legal age, and that your country has the same legal and business standards of (most of) the United States. Keep that in mind and adjust accordingly. \n\n\nYou need to begin by assessing your business structure, and ownership of your work product. If you're the sole owner of your work product, in all honesty, you hold the cards here. The way you describe it, your business \"partner\" is a parasite. He's using your tangible, functional product to generate (or attempt to generate) revenue, and either failing to fairly compensate you from that revenue or failing to monetize your product at all. \n\n\nSo, if you have a viable and beneficial product, what is stopping you from simply ending your \"partnership\" with this person? Do you have a contractual obligation to them? If so, who created this obligation? What terms were discussed when this agreement was created? Contracts have to have equitable consideration to be valid - if your agreement has become \"you do all the work, and get nothing in return\", then your contract could be in breach. What remedies did you agree to if the contract was breached? Did the two of you even have the discussion about how things can end? \n\n\nAs a little bit of wisdom for the future: a very good way to know if you want to partner with someone is if they actively discuss what happens if/when *something goes wrong*. What happens if one of you dies? Gets sick? If you are sued? Who owns what if you dissolve your partnership? Business isn't \"let's join forces and get rich\" (which is exactly what I hear you describing) but rather \"let's join forces and solve a constant stream of challenges and hopefully be profitable doing it\".\n\n\nLet me ask you this - do you have a successful family member, friend, teacher that you trust? Is there a person in your life that is generous, intelligent, and older? I think you need a mentor. A person who can ask you questions and make you think. Who can offer you advice based on experience and expertise; who has walked this road before and can help you avoid these potholes. \n\n\nIt's a tough thing for the \"nerds\" of the world - you/we tend to take things at face value, because we value accuracy and truth, and struggle to understand how someone would be willing to succeed by cheating. \n\n\nBut, unfortunately, success by lying is extremely common, and it appears your current partner is one of those people. You should start exploring what your options are to dissolve your partnership, and instead find someone who can genuinely point you towards the way forward. \n\n\nCheck with your local colleges, universities, or other institutions of higher learning. Often, they have or are affiliated with \"startup\" organizations - groups that provide funding, resources, networking, and leadership to new businesses. \n\n\nI wish you the best.",

I've gotten so many rejections that right now it almost doesn't phase me. I mean it hurts but my mind is all about going all to keep exploring and experimenting and seeing what works and what won't work. Like I'm going beyond my limits. Not having enough money is also scary as hell! I've learned more about human psychology, marketing is more about showing than telling. You'll almost never be sure many times, but just go for it. I've read some incredible books that have also helped me out. One I am reading now is called Sprint by [Jake Knapp](https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb/collections/author-books-by-jake-knapp), another that I read was The E-Myth Revisited, why most small businesses fail and why others don't. Something like that. I began seeing revenue by my 2nd month in operation. It was slow but I learned to document what was working on Notion, parts of the work I disliked and what I could do better.

If you have a large budget, it may be easier; you can advertise early, but it may also be a problem because advertising won't work if you build the wrong offer.  \nMarketing in a world drowned in AI content is a challenge; how do you get visible.   \n  \nMultitasking: same here. With a budget you can hire, without you have to do everything, and it is extremely challenging. No matter if you have a team or do it as a solopreneur, execution remains critical; the wrong offer or the wrong execution, and you will fail.   \nSo, I am building my second startup, a community of SME experts that can help startups or anyone looking to build business-related skills.   \n  \nWe are very new, and every day, we are going through all those challenges, but we won't give up. We strongly believe we have something strong because it is built on what our potential users want.  So start there, connect with people, talk about your offer, and learn even before building if you can; it will save you time and mistakes. I hope this is helpful.",

So, I began again with family, children, and house in tow. It gives me a different edge than others, or   \n\nThe corporate cage begins long before your first corporate job.  For example, everyone pushed for high paying jobs such as a doctor vs a musician.  I for one faced what to do when my son announced he is creative vs sports type (at 14 and six foot two).  So there goes my star athletes dreams for my son.  Instead I took him to different creative events, related conferences, to listen to how others succeed in the very competitive illustrationist world.\n\nConsider that hundreds of thousands if not millions  compete in a given organized sport.  Only ten of thousands get to compete at the highest college levels and only five hundred get to join the professional ranks.  An acqaintance was to be drafted professionally but before the draft he had a major injury.  So he never made the professional ranks.  Think of the professional ranks in business to be the Bezos, Zuckerberg, and so of the world.  Does this make my acquaintance any less a sports or business professional.  No, they lead a multi million dollar business with 500 employees that no one knows about.  Another leads a one or two million dollar service company and still travels the world in her free time.\n\nThe right beginning mindset for me is the quote on persistence attributed to Calvin Coolidge - never give up.  You will make mistake (we are human afterall), so learn from it then leave behind and move forward.\n\nSet goals but also create systems to enable you to achieve your goals.

Those are the people you hear about on the news, in the paper, in the magazines, on social media. They're the make it bigger and better crowd. They have insatiable appetites for power and money. They're the overachievers with 3 degree's, adrenaline hobbies and work 80 hours a week. These people emotionally abandon themselves and everyone around them. They lack close personal friendships, and often times empathy. I do not consider these people successful, even though they have private jets, multiple rental properties and a thick investment portfolio. These people are failures as humans - what makes us human.\n\nI've been living in a city around the 1%ers. I don't hesitate when I say they are the most awful, manipulative, self absorbed, narcissistic and borderline psychopathic people I've ever been around. Being around these awful human beings actually caused me to have ptsd, go into an early mid life crissis and completely change my direction in life. I am now looking to move away from this place and build a life centered around making a family, developing friendships and feeding my soul as apposed to my ego and wallet.\n\nSo, to answer your question, yes. I've known many successful business owners that focused on building balance. I was also a succesful business owner who maintained balance.",

          "body": "Workaholism is a common path to success, but it is not the only path. What we tend to call “work-life balance” is usually a moving target, and it looks different at each stage of a company. Early on, intensity often spikes. Later, the founders who keep winning are the ones who build systems that let them work with focus, not just with hours.\n\nSome very successful leaders have been public about strict boundaries, deep work over long work, sabbaticals, or seasonal sprints. Think 4-day or 5-hour workday experiments, no-meeting days, or founders who prioritize long walks, reading, and thinking time. Others design businesses that match their chosen lifestyle, which is a legitimate and difficult kind of ambition. These people are not lazy. They are obsessed with leverage, not with time on task.\n\nWhat you are noticing, that productivity can be a defense against fear, is very common. Fear of failure. Fear of irrelevance. Fear of not being enough. Workaholism can numb those feelings. The problem is that it also numbs creativity, judgment, and relationships. You can build a big company that way, but you pay for it somewhere.\n\nA more useful frame is “sustainable intensity.” You can be extremely ambitious without living at a permanent 11. The trick is to choose where intensity lives.\n\n**A simple playbook:**\n\n1. Decide your non-negotiables. Sleep, family dinners, exercise, spiritual practice, therapy, whatever keeps you sane. Put those in the calendar first and treat them like board meetings.\n2. Work in seasons. Run 6 to 8 week sprints with clear goals, then recover. Sprint, ship, recover, repeat. Always include a cool-down week where you pay down debt and protect thinking time.\n3. Make fear explicit. Write the worst-case scenario, the prevention plan, and the recovery plan. Once fear has a plan, the nervous system calms down and the need to grind for safety drops.\n4. Trade hours for leverage. Hire for outcomes, not roles. Automate reporting. Kill 80 percent of meetings. Replace generic “work more” with one needle-moving action per day.\n5. Protect deep work. Two to four hours a day of distraction-free focus beats ten hours of context switching. Phone in another room, calendar blocks, one shared priority list for the team.\n6. Design for boredom tolerance. If the only way you feel valuable is by staying busy, you will overbuild, overhire, and overcommit. Practice leaving white space, then resist filling it.\n7. Measure the real scoreboard. Energy, clarity, quality of decisions, relationships with your core people. Revenue and growth matter. These leading indicators matter first.\n\nTwo honest conclusions can both be true. One, there are founders who work less than the stereotype and still win because they design for leverage and compounding. Two, most world-class outcomes require aggressive seasons, and pretending otherwise is delusional. The art is choosing intensity on purpose, then letting it end.\n\nIf you are productive because you are scared, you are not broken. You are human. Keep the edge, lose the compulsion. Build a business that can survive your vacation. That is what success looks like when it lasts.",

Having read through the discussion here, I think the real insight several commenters have highlighted is that it's not about the hours themselves but rather the underlying motivation and system architecture.\n\n\n\nThe ilodey comment really stood out with that $2M/year e-commerce example - working 25-30 hours weekly but with extreme intentionality about saying no to non-essentials. That's a fundamentally different approach than grinding 80 hours out of fear.\n\n\n\nI think the most important distinction the community is making here is between two types of busy:\n\n\n\n1. Productive obsession: When you're genuinely passionate about solving a problem. ilooley mentioned coding for 12 hours and feeling energized rather than drained. That's quality work.\n\n\n\n2. Anxious busyness: Running from fear as you mentioned. The constant email checking, weekend work, guilt when stopping. That's burnout waiting to happen.\n\n\n\nLooking at comments from lapserdak1 and mrgoldweb, the theme is clear - successful entrepreneurs who maintain balance built systems and processes that don't require their constant presence. They delegated, automated, and scaled thinking rather than scaled their own hours.\n\n\n\nThe reality is probably that yes, you'll likely work a lot in the early stages. But that phase should be about building the infrastructure so you don't have to forever. Not every business model allows for this (as electricgnome and others pointed out), but it's worth being intentional about which business models you choose.\n\n\n\nThe test several people mentioned - can you take a week off without anxiety - is brilliant. That's your indicator of whether you've actually built a business or just created a demanding job.\n\n\n\nAppreciate you sparking this conversation. These nuances about productive work versus anxious work are crucial for entrepreneurs to understand early.",

Creating speculative assets would not be a core feature of this infrastructure and standard debt-based approaches would also not exist as primitives on this system. Things like home financing is done based on local reputation scores and would require demonstration of value-added projects to the community. \n\nI'd lobby governments and municipalities into making sure that is all above board.

I’m sure you have skills and expertise that people are willing to pay for or you wouldn’t have a job. Take one of those skills, create an avatar of people that would buy your service/expertise. Find 10 of those people, if they don’t buy what you’re selling move to the next skill until people start paying for it. Then you hire people that can do it for you. Then you find 1 person to manage those people. Make enough money to pay people a decent wage every 2 weeks, pay bills and if you are able to do that it’s just rinse and repeat.

What broke me out of it wasn't finding the \"perfect\" opportunity, it was realizing I was using research as an excuse to avoid starting anything real.\n\n\n\nHere's the thing about those markets being \"oversaturated\" - that's usually code for \"competitive but still profitable if you're actually good at it.\" I spent 2 years convincing myself everything was too crowded while sitting on my couch doing nothing. The people making real money aren't worried about saturation because they're focused on execution, not excuses.\n\n\n\nStart with something you can begin this week, not next month. Pick ONE thing from your list (I'd personally go with running ads since it's skill-based and businesses always need it) and commit to landing your first client within 30 days. Don't worry about scaling to 10k yet, worry about proving you can deliver results for one person. Most people never make it past the first client because they're too busy planning their empire instead of doing the boring work of getting good at something.\n\n\n\nThe corporate ladder isn't going anywhere if you need to fall back on it, but you'll never know what you're capable of if you keep researching instead of executing.

You’re just early enough to be seeing the highlight reels of people who’ve been grinding for years and mistaking that for everyone’s doing it but me. Trust me, most of those 10k/month people you see online either, already had skills, already had money, or they conveniently don’t show you the 18 months they made nothing.\n\nabout the everything feels saturated thing, you’re not wrong. A lot of these spaces are saturated because people jump in blindly, copy whatever a guru says, and expect money to fall out of the sky. That’s why most fail.\n\nI’ll tell you what I tell anyone I’ve worked with, online income isn’t hard because the business models are bad. It’s hard because people underestimate the skill part. You mentioned ads which is a perfect example. Ads used to be a cheat code. If you run ads before building trust, you’re basically burning money. People don’t buy because they saw your ad. They buy because they trust the person behind the ad.\n\nI’ve seen people throw 500- 2k into ads with zero return because the foundation wasn’t there. Same with ecom, with digital products and with high ticket offers.\n\nEvery single model requires, knowing how to build a brand, knowing how to market without being annoying, learning how to create demand, learning how to communicate value, consistency and actual patience\n\nNobody wants to talk about those parts because they’re not lavish\n\nAnd yes, start while you’re still working. Anyone telling you to quit your job and go all in is setting you up to panicbuild instead of grow. Your job buys you time, reduces pressure, and lets you actually learn instead of chasing quick wins.\n\nIf I were starting at 20 again, I’d pick one model that actually aligns with my strengths, get the right education around it (whether through paid programs or months of deep research), and treat the first 6 months as skill building not income chasing. Real money comes once you stop trying to get rich fast and actually learn how the machine works.\n\nIf you want to talk specifics or narrow down what fits you, I don’t mind helping, been in the space a while and I’ve seen what actually works versus what just looks good on social media",

          "body": "Honestly I literally have no time and I work a fast paced corporate job but that’s because I started 7 different brands/projects that are all currently making me some money until I build my team. But I know what you mean you just have to get accustomed to the idea that you can’t build a business over night. I think that’s what I struggled with the most and I want to get everything done today or when I get off from work and it just can’t get done especially if you also prioritize going to the gym and have a day for cleaning and meal prepping. But what I can say starting was probably the second hardest thing and laying down the foundations. But like many in the sub and everywhere you will read and watch business is about testing and speed. If you get an idea just take action and test if it works and makes you some money. Yeah you have to give it time to see if it works but the steps for every model for the online space are almost the same. Not to be general and cliche the steps are get an idea, build a website or mvp with a waiting list or form, market your idea either social media organic or running ads to that website, and track absolutely everything. Scrolls, clicks, all the data you can gather collect it because later it will be useful. But yeah that’s the jist of things. I’m way farther than I was when I started and I got there by first doing one task a day and that turned into 3 tasks that o do daily. And then it just becomes autonomous",

I met him through FB when he messaged me after I posted some Google Business Results from another client of mine, and after some talking back and forth, he agreed he wanted to give it a go. Things were great, rankings were moving, client was very responsive. Essentially, everything I could ask for until eventually he decided to go against my word in favor of a buddy he knows. Whatever right it's his business, but this eventually became a constant theme and would leak over into our work. Before you know it, these \"Suggestions\" his buddy was making would move our rankings from number 2 in the map pack generating 50-60 calls a month down into the top 5 where calls were still good but nowhere near the same, and you could feel there was no bottom/end to this until eventually he fired me when I refused some of the vital changes he wanted.\n\nI didn't take it to heart, aside from the friend stuff he was a good guy so we parted ways but I guess things continued to drop in ranking once I left. Now fast forward to a few months out and I guess he's convinced himself that I'm doing voodoo black hat magic against his business. Like I said interesting scenario but I can asssure you I'm not tampering or doing anything and it actually pisses me off a little that he would assume that, considering my only goal in the first place was to help him out and I even gave that little rat a discount when he first signed. I'm a little heated but what do you think the best way to tell him to F\\*\\*\\* off is without escalating this any further?",

Immediately shut it down (3m response time) and message the owner. \"lol it was me, I wanted to have someone else look at the website, it's slow and I don't get sales.\" \n\nHe says this with a 15k product catalog and his insistence that it will work on a much slower hosting. (I highly recommend Azure/AWS... he chose the cheap VPS option)\n\nMy contract has exclusive rights to vendor selection because I work with startups, they don't like vetting businesses, and this client is ATF regulated. I find that the vendor he was trying to use isn't a valid registered business and my client just tried to give Admin with PII and 4473 info to a random.\n\nI'm pissed because he then said he hasn't been making money and not getting traffic literally 16 days after I just sent him a full report saying otherwise.\n\nLawyers look over everything and send him a Breach of Contract with Remediation scheduled. \n\nHe sent me a \"I just have been stressed and took it out on you... I have no way out of this contract\". Which is false, there is a convenience clause he could've ended with 60 day notice. (Not a normal thing for Marketing Contracts)\n\nONE DAY before the meeting... he schedules an appointment with the same people who I just said were not valid to work with AFT compliant businesses.\n\nClient was immediately fired and my lawyers billed him for 6x the amount + my hourly to get things transferred and deal with ATF compliance burden.\n\nMoral of the story: have a solid contract before doing any work.

Cease all informal contact.\n* **Demand Absolute Specificity:** Require a comprehensive and formal submission detailing their claims, including:\n   * A detailed, itemized list of all alleged grievances.\n   * A precise monetary value assigned to each alleged damage, supported by a thorough justification of how that value was calculated.\n   * A complete list of any and all potential witnesses, including their full contact information.\n   * Certified copies of any and all documentation they believe substantiates their claim.\n\n**The Strategy:** The endless requests for documentation and strict adherence to arbitrary procedures are designed to exhaust their energy and motivation. This isn't about winning an argument; it's about making the process so arduous that they give up.\n\n**Your Demeanor:** Your calm, composed, and detached tone is your greatest asset. It subconsciously de-escalates the situation. By refusing to engage in an emotional exchange, you control the entire dynamic of the interaction.\n\n**Advanced Tactics:** Invent your own internal \"policies\" for handling such disputes. For example: \"It is the policy of this respondent to require all financial claims to be substantiated by no fewer than two independent, certified appraisals.\"\n\nYou can also quote long, fabricated policy statements in your responses to further bog them down in procedural quicksand.

If you proactively try to learn things and learn them fast, while also knowing what to learn depending on situations, you'll be good. Sometimes, certain skills can be helpful but a waste of time if you learn them at the wrong time. For instance, learning a lot about M&amp;A (merger and acquisition) or how to manage 1,000 employees when you're first week into your business is pointless. Yeah it sounds cool because big players do it, but you don't need to learn those at first.\n\nThis is also why building a good team is important, so that you're not just one person trying to learn so many skills. Each one on the team, including yourself, should be really good at something. Generally speaking, one person to build stuff and one person to sell is a good combo when you already know you have a viable service/product.",

I've seen technically perfect products fail because the founder couldn't communicate value or reach customers. Second, develop a relentless problem-solving mindset rather than chasing perfection in every skill area. Third, focus on customer discovery before you build anything - this saves you from building something nobody wants. Fourth, understand basic business fundamentals like cash flow and unit economics. Finally, consistency matters more than perfection at the start. The businesses that survive aren't run by experts in everything, but by people willing to learn what they need to learn when they need to learn it. Your biggest early wins will come from customer conversations and sales, not from having the perfect tech stack.

Finally feels sustainable.\n\nBut those first months? Nobody warns you. Everyone just posts their success screenshots.\n\nIf you're thinking about going independent:\n\n- You need 6-9 months runway minimum\n- Your network probably isn't as good as you think\n- Cold outreach sucks but it's necessary\n- Rejection is constant at first\n- The uncertainty is mentally exhausting\n\nStill glad I did it.

          "body": "Here's my take. I used to run a construction business but taught myself how to build software. I developed my own crm, some marketing software, built the website and self hosted everything off a server in my apartment. On the plus side my office overhead was like $20/month for all the software we used because I built it.\n\nI tossed around the idea of starting a software company but I'm hesitent. Here's my take:\n\n1. As a non technical founder, you don't have the depth of knowledge to understand if a specific software stack is actually profitable. Most \"tech bros\" actually jam together a bunch of services and put their logo on it and call it \"their software\" when in reality they are paying 6 other companies for access to THEIR software. Basically you \"own the brand\" but not the actual software.\n2. Profitability is in the stack and not necessarily what the software does. For example, my website + lead gen software cost me $3/month. If you use wix, or another website builder, you'd pay $25-$50/month for the same service I get for $3 because I built it myself. So, if you don't create a \"software moat\" it's likely you'll end up using multiple other vendors to build your \"stack\" and end up bleeding all the upside in monthly API fees. If you build an AI automated CRM (for example) but you plug into AWS and GPT for api calls and hosting, you'll rack up $1000s/month in \"fees\". If you host the CRM yourself and train a small AI model, you're overhead would be near 0.\n3. The market is flooded and I mean FLOODED, with software. Unless you are excelent at sales and marketing, you'll struggle to provide any real value that other, larger companies don't. And, software behavior is very entrenched, people don't switch tools if ever. For example, a CRM, getting a company to switch from Microsoft to my CRM would be a nightmare and then try integrating it with their other workflows...just a huge hassle.\n\nAnyway, I'm not saying you can't do it. But from my perspective unless the software is self contained and built and the \"moat\" is in the stack - ie, cheap to actually scale, it's not an easy business to get into. Alot of the software bros you'll see either developed some niche tool that happens to solve some deep industry specific issue, OR were given a bunch of money and are living on hype and debt.\n\nTLDR \n\n  \nSo, is it worth it? Idk maybe lol. You don't need to be technical to sell something, but being technical helps because you can cut costs.",

Figure out total revenue avg customer brings in lifetime and then figure out a to acquire customers for 1/3rd of that cost.  We spend about $5k per month to acquire $5k in MRR. So those customers are basically profitable from the 2nd week, and avg retention is 2 years.\n\nAnd regarding the channels itself, here are every channel that works for us today:\n\n1. Google Ads: 80% of our customers find us through Google search ads, where we spend around $5k per month. Most of these are on our industry keywords and competitor keywords. \n2. Reddit: We have setup Reddit notifier on certain keywords around the problem we solve to get notified anytime someone comments or makes a post. Somebody from our team usually joins the thread and adds value while subtle plugging the our product- no links, just name!\n3. Blogs &amp; SEO: Since Google search ads already work for us, we invest consistently on SEO via blogs on our website to show up as top result or on AI overview for customer searches on Google! These days these are mostly automated using AI tools like Frizerly and Pulse and stuff!\n4. Conferences: We always asked our friends in the space what conferences they were going to, and we would go hang out around there for free and talk to as many people as we can. \n5. LinkedIn Founder Marketing: This is something that works for us but I hate doing it. But making thought leadership content and posting it under your founder profile helps especially if your target customers are on LinkedIn. For a lot of the startups I personally know, this is the primary channel right now!\n\nAnd that’s about it. Hope this helps anyone out there in the similar space &amp; good luck!",

It's about genuine conversations and sharing what we've learned, even those face-palm moments.\n\nSomething else that's been a game-changer: strategic partnerships.

Plus, LinkedIn has been surprisingly good for B2B connections - though you've got to be consistent with it.\n\nBiggest lesson learned? Don't spread yourself too thin trying to be on every platform.

Our clients selling software or services see the best ROI from LinkedIn engagement paired with email, not just blasting generic messages. SEO works great for products with clear search intent, but it takes 6-9 months before you see real traffic so don't expect quick wins.\n\nFor consumer products, paid ads on Meta or TikTok can work but your unit economics need to be dialed in first or you'll just burn cash. Organic social only scales if you're willing to post daily for months and actually engage with your audience, most technical founders hate that grind.\n\nPartnerships and referrals beat every other channel once you've got your first 10-20 happy customers. Focus on delivering results that make people want to tell their friends, then build systems to encourage those referrals. That compounds way faster than any paid channel and costs basically nothing.\n\nThe real answer is pick one channel, commit for 90 days, and actually get good at it instead of dabbling in everything. Most technical founders fail at marketing because they treat it like an experiment instead of doubling down on what shows early promise.",

I’m hoping for some guidance across a few subreddits because I feel like I'm at a breaking point.\n\nI’m almost 40 and make about $70k a year, but after a lot of self-reflection and working with a professional, I’ve confirmed that my mental health issues are coming directly from the work itself. I’ve tried switching jobs, but everything I’m qualified for ends up being another desk job. And I just can’t do it anymore.\n\nI’d rather work 60+ hours a week *for myself* than keep forcing myself through a 9–5 where I’m chained to a computer. I don’t need to be rich—I just need to be stable and sane.\n\nI live in a rural area (Sayre, PA). Here, everyone and their cousin runs a handyman service, landscaping business, or garden business—so breaking into those feels like fighting over scraps. I don’t have a trade license, and I can’t afford to reboot a whole career while paying my mortgage.\n\n**But I** ***do*** **have $70,000 saved right now that I can put toward building something of my own.**\n\nMy question is:  \n**What can someone in my position reasonably do with $70k to break free from traditional office work and build a self-sustaining career?**\n\nI’m open to:\n\n* Service-based businesses\n* Mobile businesses\n* Online/remote businesses that *aren’t* corporate desk jobs\n* Buying equipment and starting something myself\n* Anything that gets me out of a cubicle and gives me control over my schedule\n\nI’m not afraid of long hours. I’m not afraid of hard physical work. I just need something that isn’t slowly destroying my mental health.\n\n**If you were in my situation—rural area, almost 40, $70k saved, burned out from office life—what would you do? What opportunities am I not seeing?**\n\nAny real-world advice or ideas from people who’ve made a similar transition would mean a lot.\n\nThank you.",

I get why you are done with the office stuff, and the fact that you have seventy thousand saved puts you in a very strong position.\n\nThe one piece of advice I would give you is this. Do not stop working under any circumstances. That savings buys you flexibility, not a full exit. What it really gives you is the chance to move into something lower stress and more tolerable while you build your own thing on the side. That can be a simple job, something physical, something that brings a bit of joy or at least does not drain you the way a desk job does. But having some income and staying in the working world matters a lot.\n\nIf you walk away completely, start a business, and it fails, coming back in will be much harder. Your work history stalls, your network gets cold, and your confidence takes a hit. If you keep even a part time job, you keep income, structure, and connections while you experiment.\n\nUse the seventy thousand to remove pressure, not to replace income. Let your business grow slowly and organically on the side. Test ideas, try small bets, learn what actually works for you. When the income from your business is consistently beating what you can earn with your time at a job, and it clearly needs more of your hours to keep growing, that is when you quit. Until then, adjust your job, lower your hours if you can, choose something easier if you need to, but do not stop working.",

But you could start as a side hustle something until it paid enough to replace your day job. You might explore liquidation auctions, then list your products on, say, EBay. You can make a very good income. So many things one could do. But if I were you I would figure out what is going on internally that cause you not to have the ability to cope.

Instead, if someone needs to spend less, figure out what you can offer that is inside their budget. If you're normally $100 and she only has $75, figure out what you can offer (profitably) at $75.

      "selftext": "Small business has 15-20 employees. Most are part time, and a few are full time. One part time staff has asked if we plan to provide healthcare benefits (plus vision and dental) at some point. She has a daytime / full time job where she is getting benefits currently and said she would like to come over full time if we can provide benefits. She says that her current employer \"takes care of everything\" and that she does not pay any contribution to the plan. So I said I will look into it. For her plus her spouse and child, the total monthly premium on a mid-level package is about $2,200 per month if I did 100% employer contribution. For context she is support staff making $29 / hr.\n\nFor me it's too much of a stretch to justify at $26K annual benefits package for someone whose base is roughly $60K / yr. I could change the contribution rate to say 50/50, but then I'm not competitive with her current FT employer and I think the premium split at 50% would be prohibitive for her and her family anyway.\n\nSo the question is: how do small businesses do this? I know there are a lot of options out there, but for those of you that have been down this road, what did you learn along the way? What was the best option that you settled on? I'd really like to offer competitive comp packages, but health benefits seem especially difficult.\n\nThanks!",

The policies you can get are similarly priced to the exchange anyway. That way they know how much this shit costs and they pick the plan so it’s not your fault when it doesn’t cover anything. \n\nThe other problem with a plan is you have to have like 80% of people on it and not everyone wants to be. So if you hire someone who’s 60 it’s $1500 a month, but then the 24 year old wants you to “just pay me more” but if they aren’t on it you drop below 80%. Or let’s say you do pay them more and then in 2 years they drop off their parents insurance and want on, but they don’t want a drop in pay. \n\nI sincerely wish I’d have never messed with it.

Businesses,  unless they are a large group which can self fund their plan may have a chance if they really care out their PBM/specialty drugs. Not only that - but the value from healthcare today just isn’t there. It’s darn near impossible to get a primary care md, appt, much less specialty care. There are options to consider like direct primary care - and concierge medicine where people actually get to see a doctor on a regular basis.  At least there’s some continuity of care. Put it together with a major medical for catastrophic- and you may actually be able to get back to what it was before the ACA fully rolls back. Leverage a CannaRx for specialty meds.   What most people don’t quite understand is that insurance rates are based on a pooled population. The larger the pool, the lower rate for everybody whether you’re buying from the exchanges or whether you’re buying a private plan from a carrier.  Doesn’t matter. So what’s happening now is you’re getting a smaller pool. The people left in the pool pay more. =ALL insured people will pay more. There is no replacement for “Obamacare”  and it’s pretty clear the “concepts of a plan” is nothing.  So what’s the solution? Either talk to a broker about self- funding- to be safe you should have about $250k to even have that discussion. The other option is a voucher - not sure how fast that’s all getting repealed. You should talk to a small market broker. As a small employer- things are just getting more difficult (tariffs - direct and indirect impact), labor crunch-immigration, and this is one more measure to make it harder to retain good talent. I’m sorry. I had 3 locations and just shuttered 2 because of all of the above. Last year I saw the writing on the wall and re-og’d. We had to get nimble, reorganize and leverage tech instead, which is what we were trying to avoid at all costs. Not good but it was better than losing everything.

I was in charge of much of the finance. He would talk to his clients, tell them not to worry about this months bill, or tell me not to worry if they didn't pay, we would collect next month. Some of his clients owed over $100k, but most $30-60k. I wrote him emails, outlined my concerns that those clients didn't need us as bad as we needed them, that their balances were too high, that we couldn't swing those kind of outstanding balances. Every month was a struggle to make payroll but he wanted to believe and wanted other people to believe that money wasn't a big deal. \n\nAnyways fast forward, all those people stiffed him. His accounts receivable was nearly $400k when I quit. All the people who I said were going to walk out on their bills did. He is an attorney, and even tried taking one of those clients to court, and so far it has backfired spectacularly. \n\nMoral of the story is you don't work for free. The minute someone stops paying is the minute the work stops. None of those clients are your friends. You do work for them, and they pay you.",

He was an M&amp;A broker and claimed breach of contract for $1m in damages on a $20m sale. \n\nHe cleverly requested a jury trial instead of a judge trial since thats the plaintiffs right too choose.\n\nHis whole case was based on a verbal contract even though all he ever did was exchange about 8 emails with the owners and sat in on one meeting. The jury ultimately decided this was enough to establish a verbal contract and voted unanimously after 10 minutes of deliberation to award him $1m -- I shit you not.\n\nVerbal contracts do hold up in court. I would assume you have emails and history to prove the same? I would advise consulting with a different attorney that knows contract law -- ideally on contingency if you feel like you have a strong enough paper trail.\n\nGood luck and dont give up just yet!",

You're dealing with a classic case of people treating your private property like a public park because it's pretty and convenient. Here's a clear breakdown:\n\n### You're in the right (legally and morally):\n- **Your dock = private property.** In New England (and the US generally), a dock extending from your land is yours, even if it's over water. The public has **no automatic right** to use it.\n- **No permission = trespassing.** Photographers sneaking onto your dock (or using it while pretending to be customers) are trespassing, plain and simple. The \"public business\" argument only applies to your **storefront or public areas**—not your private dock.\n- **\"Navigable waters\" don’t help them.** People love to throw this around, but it only applies to **boating under** your dock, not **walking on it** or setting up tripods.\n\n### Why they feel entitled:\n- **Instagram culture.** Your dock is photogenic. Word spreads fast on local photography groups (\"secret spot\" vibes).\n- **Tourist mindset.** People see \"fish shack + dock\" and assume it’s part of the public coastal aesthetic.\n- **Sneaky tactics.** Pretending to browse fish? Classic move to avoid confrontation.\n\n### What you can do (practical steps):\n1. **Post clear signs** (at the dock entrance and store):\n   &gt; \"PRIVATE DOCK – NO PHOTOSHOOTS WITHOUT PERMISSION. VIOLATORS WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE.\"\n   &gt; Add a small \"Photo permit: $50/hour – ask inside\" if you want to monetize it.\n\n2. **Confront calmly but firmly** (script):\n   &gt; \"Hi, this is private property. Photo shoots need permission. You’ll need to wrap up or purchase a permit inside.\"\n\n3. **Install a cheap camera** (pointed at the dock). A blinking red light deters 90% of sneakiness.\n\n4. **Offer a paid option** (optional):\n   - $75/hour for solo photographers.\n   - $150 for families/weddings.\n   - You control access, make money, and avoid arguments.\n\n5. **Call police if needed** (last resort). Trespassing is trespassing. A single visit from local PD will end the problem.\n\n### Bonus idea:\nTurn it into a **feature**. \"Sunset dock photos – book your slot!\" You’d be shocked how many will pay $100 for 30 minutes of golden hour.\n\n**Bottom line:** You’re not overreacting. Protect your space. Start with signs + polite enforcement, escalate as needed. The dock is yours—make them respect it (or pay for it).",

They were born before the business really booms. They realize that money comes with sacrifices (to simplify).

The grandpa had already long since passed away by this time, but I met the 2nd generation owner / the father, and he intimated to me that he regretted that his son sold the business off. He was just too old and was long retired so had no say in the matter, just a quiet sad regret.

First person knows what it is and does their best to relay the info to the next person. 2nd person does their best to repeat the info to the next person but along the way the info gets corrupted and by the time the 4th person tries to relay the info, the 5th person has to guess what it is. Most of the time, not even close.\n\nIf everything is systemized well, you pass down the knowledge of not only how to run the business but also the traits needed to run the system. You need to pass the traits to the kids. We see this all too often because owners are not passing the system and the traits to the kids and it amplifies to where the 3rd gen don’t care and they piss away the money. \n\nIf you know as first gen that your system is crappy, I’d sell the business upon retirement, put it in a trust and let it grow from there, let the gens get dividends.\n\nAsk yourself this question. Can you franchise your business? If yes, you have a highly systemized business. If no, get to work, systemized it. This is why you can go to many McDonalds or Chick Fil A, it’s exactly the same. Every person has a duty station responsible for their own station. You must delegate and systemized every single thing. Don’t assume people to know.

Then you have the entitlement to- “my dad did more, you guys don’t work for the family so we should decide and get more etc” even when it’s equal voting rights.\n\nOther issue is when 3rd gen members join the family business straight out of college. Ideally they should bugger off and go learn new tricks/perspectives from other businesses and bring it back to the family in 20 years.

Crafting a unique selling proposition (USP) that differentiates your SaaS.  A great book on that is Positioning by Al Ries.  Offer is the most neglected area that I see businesses avoid.

Awareness is the 2nd most neglected area that I see businesses avoid.  They think the thing they sell, should sell itself.\n\n3. Delivery.  Building a product/service/system that around that offer.  Most businesses put almost all effort into this area and think that it is the Offer and since it is the Offer that word-of-mouth is the Awareness.  They think the thing they sell, should sell itself.  That's incorrect.\n\n1. Offer - Identify the problem and favorite customer.  Test the idea, before building if you can.\n\n2.

      "selftext": "This is based in Ontario, Canada 🇨🇦 \n\nI am not mentioning names because I do not want legal issues, but I need to get this off my chest.\n\nA while ago I started providing cleaning services for a couple who owned an Airbnb. The husband acted like a big entrepreneur and constantly talked up his plans. His wife was an influencer with millions of followers. I barely ever spoke to her and she never communicated with me, but he kept bringing her up as if her follower count meant their business was legitimate.\n\nHis business partner was a realtor and the two of them acted like they were on the verge of building a large real estate empire. They told me they were buying 13 properties in Orlando and said I would get all the cleaning contracts. I run a cleaning agency and handle hiring, interviews, scheduling and operations, but I still let their hype get to me.\n\nLooking back, it is embarrassing how much I believed them.\n\nThey pushed me to lower my prices and told me I would make more long term because of the volume they would bring. Lower rates meant cleaners made less money and did not want to work their job, which caused constant staffing issues. They did not care. They just wanted cheaper labor.\n\nThey nitpicked everything. Small towel marks, tiny smudges, anything they could point to. One time four towels were slightly dirty. Instead of washing them, he ordered more than two hundred dollars worth of towels and cloths without asking and then made me pay him back for the order. He acted like he was helping me by explaining how to claim the HST.\n\nHe often acted friendly and gave me advice as if he was mentoring me, then switched into being demanding and controlling. The most insulting thing he said was, “You should not run a cleaning business if you are not a cleaner.” I run a real agency. I am educated and I manage the business. I do not need to personally scrub toilets to operate a company. His comment showed he did not respect what I built.\n\nSomething important is that during this time I kept asking him about Orlando. I told him I was planning to open a branch there. I told him I was hiring people. He knew I was taking the opportunity seriously and believed what he said. Despite that he kept lying about the 13 houses and the future work. He watched me prepare for something that did not exist.\n\nEventually my only Hamilton cleaner quit and after more than thirty hours of interviewing and reviewing applications I realized the entire situation was a dead end. Their budget did not match their expectations and every cleaner disliked going there. The promises were never real.\n\nI finally sent a formal message ending the relationship and telling them I would no longer be providing cleaning services. They never replied. No thank you. No acknowledgment. Nothing.\n\nThat silence told me everything.\n\nHere is the interesting part. Because of their constant talk about Orlando, I actually opened a branch there. I hired people and started operating. And somehow it worked. I am now running my agency in Orlando and so far it has been more successful than what I had in Hamilton. I never would have considered Orlando if it was not for their story, even though their own plans were fake.\n\nSo in a strange way, something good did come out of this. I just had to learn the hard way that not everyone who talks big is telling the truth.\n\nHere is what I learned:\n\nPeople connected to influencers are not automatically professional or honest.\nPeople who promise future opportunities often want discounts today.\nFriendly behavior does not mean respect.\nAnyone who tries to devalue your work is not a partner and never will be.\nSometimes walking away is the best business decision you can make.\n\n\n\n\nForgot to add:\n\nThe biggest red flag I ignored was the fact that they dropped their long time cleaner for my company. No warning to her, nothing. They just kicked her out to start using me. She was really good to them from what I heard &amp; only had a minor scheduling issue. Also, the main guy I was dealing with lied to me that “guests are refusing to pay the higher cleaning fee” when he never updated the cleaning fee on Airbnb from $120 to $200 (which is what I charged him). I know this because I checked the listing every day for new reviews. So that was also a ploy to get me to lower the cleaning fee… I’m probably forgetting some things.",

There must be at least two people to cover accounting and all aspects of operations. But there must be one boss. \n\n\nIn my opinion, accounting is God, but operations needs to understand that any sneeze that impacts the GL must be thought through. Ops people don’t get that. In fairness, accounting people don’t get ops. \n\nHR and CRM stuff can come later but those modules are really like cake decorations and perhaps better handled with outside systems and integrated into NS. \n\nYour CFO isn’t wrong, but there are a hundred things you should do before you engage with NetSuite. \n\nAsk AI to create a list of everything you should do before you make that discovery call. \n\nAmong them should be readable spreadsheets the NS engineers can decipher because you’re gonna want custom searches and reports setup to match the spreadsheet purgatory you created and wish to escape. \n\nNS will not really walk you through it. They assume you get them, they don’t truly need to get you, and you burn up all your support hours finding that out as they constantly switch their own internal support teams and leads around. \n\nHave only one leader to be 100% devoted to NetSuite and NOTHING ELSE. Not the CFO for goodness sake. Someone who has a broad technical background and expansive business mind who understands company systems impact and integration. \n\nIf you’re gonna invest in NS, make it count.\n\nEdit: I don’t know why the point above is bold but it works.",

We're in heavy preparation mode now.  While we still don't truly need it, the expansion into midmarket and enterprise will be much easier if we can hand over our SOC2 audit opinion when pursing this business.\n\nThere IS enormous value for us in securing the SOC2. It has many strong prescriptions in it for the Security Controls such as penetration testing, endpoint protection, documented processes around change and incident management and so much more.  We do all these things as part of our vCISO service offering.  We even have helped others secure their SOC2 type II audits, but it was time for us to ensure everything was buttoned up in our own business and get the audit.  It helped focus our existing processes and refine them into truly operational procedures we follow.\n\nThe costs of SOC2 assessments have been coming down as well.  Traditional vendors like Drata, Vanta, SecureFrame, or you can save some time and money with some new AI start-ups (do your homework please).  One AI based startup in the SOC2 space is Delve.  We've gone with them and they are pretty responsive to our questions, and their value proposition was amazing in comparison to the larger more traditional Tooling vendors.\n\nUltimately, you can say no.  Just be prepared to get a lot of TPRM (Third Party Risk Management) questionnaires, and be sure to DO what you SAY YOU DO in your answers (they will check and ask for evidence until your get an Auditor confirmation of things in a SOC2 Type II).",

It's really just about having the correct data controls in place, and it's way easier to build it into your processes from the start than retrospectively having to do it.\n\nSOC 2 is a different beast altogether. It's one of those things you don't need to do until you need to do it. The cost and time sink can be brutal early on. What I've found with most startups I've worked with is that most enterprise clients will send you a security questionnaire anyway, and SOC 2 is just one tick box - they still want to know about your encryption, access controls, developer training, all of it. So make sure your fundamental security is watertight first, then consider SOC 2 when you're actually losing deals without it. You'll know when that happens - suddenly every enterprise client will be asking for it.\n\n\\- Luke @ Baremetrics",

My bank told me today that they will no longer be giving out pennies to their business accounts due to the fact that they are not being made anymore.\n\nI know McD (at least in my area) is already saying the same thing, that they are rounding their change off of the nickel now. Has anyone else run into this yet and if so, what is your plan for this? \n\nIn theory, I'm okay with my cashiers just rounding the totals, but to be honest they freak out when someone gives them extra money just to round out their change. \n\nWe've floated the idea of changing our pricing to be tax inclusive, but that means redoing all the pricing and I'd rather not have to do this if it's not necessary. Any suggestions would definitely be helpful!",

However they are branded well, have multiple officers and warehouses all over the area, you can't even hit a stop light without looking up with one of their vehicles. \n\nI've been tasked to help a company who is taking a slightly different approach to these contracts grow their business but of course that means going after monopoly contracts. These deals are multi-year so when you miss them it could be another 3-5 before you get a chance to bid again. A lot of them also have RFPs, so you can spend a week with a team combing through the details and building a very thought through proposal. \n\nIn the last 4 months, we have been told that we've won 9 contracts that would have been taken from this competitor, however, in every single instance, they had the option in their existing contract to price match and ultimately got to keep it themselves. All the time and effort we put in it just so the big guy can say yeah we'll do that is tiring. \n\nHow can you possibly get past this? \n\nIt's almost all about the money by the way. Corporations, hotel chains, HOA boards are the ones making these decisions. If they can squeak out more money for the deal that's all that matters to them unless someone royally screws up. The little things like we provide better customer service, we're technology focused, increase customer spending etc are all looked at as salesman fluff. \n\nAlso you don't get to meet with the decision makers very easily. Going after a Hilton hotel, the local GM has little say. Going after a neighborhood, there are a dozen people on the HOA board and you may have only spoken to one of them.\n\nWhat can be done here?",

Faster response times, better staff who are treated and paid better so are nicer to the customers etc. Whatever it takes.\n\nThis isn't foolproof though - if the customer has a checklist of requirements, then it's easy for them to overlook the nuances of the quality of those things, especially if they're procuring from head office, where checklists and price are all they're really going to look at....so you really need to go deep on how you are more than just A N Other supplier, so deep in fact that it becomes obvious that the BEST monopoly supplier can do is not even acceptable in your world.\n\nAlternatively, you can play the longer game. Note, I've seen this play out myself, but in the software world rather than services. The principle is the same, however.\n\nYou know when contracts are due up, so instead of waiting for the RFP to be issued, spend 12-18 months running up to it effectively demonstrating how your service is better. Attend relevant conferences and trade shows. Figure out a new process, give it a funky name. Make sure that by the time the RFP is being put together, your approach is already on their lips. Make it so those going shopping are already thinking about what you offer, and then be the ones to actually offer it.\n\nBasically, spend some time in the run up to contract renewals seeding potential clients with you, your approach, and how it's the right choice. The more subliminal / indirect, the better. If you can leave them wanting something and not even knowing who provides it until your proposal ticks every box, then you've done it perfectly.\n\nMake this large company compete with you, rather than the other way around.",

For context, my company is like 30 people across 3 states and a few contractors in Canada. We plan to add significantly more headcount in mid 2026. We were on Paylocity first but it was clunky. So we switched to Gusto but it glitched a few times and trying to get a hold of the support team was really painful and slow. Now Rippling keeps coming up in my LinkedIn feed. I’m trying to decide what’s actually worth the pain of switching. We don’t need everything. I just want something that handles multi-state and international payroll without breaking.

I asked because they had lost majority of their clients due to bad reputation. Ever since the owner started handling customers (after covid) they started feeling too disrespected to continue a business relationship. The brand itself left a bad taste because all they saw was the owner... he immediately said no to rebranding, and they're currently shutting down because they've lost the remaining high-paying clients, struggle to get new ones, and he's fallen ill... \n\nI have so many similar stories. \n\nIf you are running a business, please, detach from it.

Multi-state taxes, off-cycle adjustments, and benefit integrations can reveal how flexible (or rigid) each system really is.
