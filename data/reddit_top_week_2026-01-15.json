I guarantee they will say they desperately need drivers.  The catch is is 4-5 hrs a day usually and split shift.  People hate driving school buses and kids in general.  Get past that and it’s usually $1k and there’s extra days you can drive sometimes.  Just my .2. If you’re looking for online I don’t think it’s possible",

There's no skill you can learn in a month that reliably pays $1k/month. Most of this is compounding over time. You have to go into it accepting it might not work in 1 year, maybe not even 2 - but in 5 years it will.\n\nIt's that saying \"People overestimate what they can do in 1 year and underestimate what they can do in 10\"",

Also because the last year was much tougher. Costs, tariffs, layoffs, etc. seemed like there were fewer students looking for tutoring and I had no interest in lowering my rates. I made it up by taking on contracts with other companies who needed tutors  \n  \nI know I clearly have a viable business idea but wonder if 6 figures worthy. Is my revenue because I cannot dedicate full time to it or is this market not big enough? Has anyone else tried a side hustle and then moved it to full time after a certain revenue threshold?",

Right now its capped because of time, not demand, and that matters.\n\nThe real question is this: can you remove yourself from the hours. If income only goes up when you personally tutor more, then going full time just means longer days and more stress, not scale.\n\nBefore quitting I would try one thing first. Use the job as a safety net and test leverage. Hire one tutor. Raise prices slightly. Productise something. If you can push it past the current ceiling without doubling your hours, then you have something real.\n\nAlso worth saying, last year being tougher is a warning sign. You dont want to jump just as demand softens. Build a buffer. Prove 50k plus is repeatable, not a good year.\n\nIf it still works with less you involved, then yeah, different convo. Otherwise its just a very good side hustle.",

A plumber or electrician doesnt say ok you called me and im gonna do this job for you based on what you want to pay me. They show up and investigate the situation then give you an estimate.  You gotta work on not being over eager and treat every customer like they have the money to afford your skill set. It's up to them to decide if they can or they can't. \n\nThis is where discovery time comes in. A consultation. Talk through the project. Discuss barriers that may exist. Then you work out an itemized invoice for the work. Put those details in your contract a long with your time lines, expectations for payment and any Terms and Conditions that you have set for your freelance business. \n\nTake some time to set some baseline prices for yourself. If a client wants a landing page what all does that entail? Are you providing domain hosting, email accounts? Will you have to come up with the page copy on your own. Will you have to source images? Will you be offering maintenance? Will you be providing on page SEO with the copy? \n\nTheres not a single instance for me that i would accept $300 to build a landing page. It's too important for them and requires thoughtful planning if there will be no additional pages to follow. \n\nI also only build in wordpress and have all of the Pro features  for my builder and my widgets. \n\nI chose to handle my business one way, that lets people im very good and efficient at what I do. I take my business seriously and take their project seriously. It's our job to lead them to understand why your prices are what they are and that goes beyond your portfolio. \n\nI'd advise you to stop \"Taking Jobs\"  based on what they can pay and start setting your prices for yourself and what you need to be able to operate your business and live your life. \n\nThink about getting a CRM I use Honeybook its great. If someone has an issue with my prices, at that point and at my discretion i can offer breaking it into payments that they can handle. My only policy with that is Auto-Pay must be used for a payment plan. I will shut shit down if i dont get paid. \n\nNever had an issue. I build 30-50 page sites. It got easier getting those clients when i was able to present myself confidently as a business and i put in place a professional workflow. \n\nLesson learned. Good luck.",

How many revisions of copy? How many revisions of design? How many revisions of wireframes? Is there content? Who is providing it? Does the project include wireframes? How many sections? Who is providing imagery? Who is going to QA? What functionality is included? What is the expected timeline?Etc. etc.)\n2) a standard creative briefing document for your client to fill in that essentially becomes the “bible” of the project.

With nsfw content. 😂 go figure people want that kind of stuff. Anyways, I sell it on some different storefronts and build up a readership following me. I’d say half is AI, but the other half is good creativity, else you just get lost in the storm of bad AI content. Anyhow, if anyone wants to know more, it’s pretty specialized stuff and most people don’t make much. But it’s possible. And from what I can tell, there are a lot of people out there making a lot of money in the same sort of niche. I also sell custom stories too, which I can partially make with AI.

      "selftext": "I’m a office worker, marketing role, nothing fancy. Most days by the time I get home, eat something random, and sit down, it’s already close to 9pm. That’s basically the only time I have for my own stuff.\n\nI’ve been trying to start a small side project for months now. Not some big startup dream, just a little online store idea I kept thinking about during work. The idea itself never felt that hard, it was always the starting that stopped me. Once I thought about hosting, themes, product pages, payments, I’d just close the laptop and scroll instead.\n\nLast week I finally forced myself to do something, even if it was messy. I told myself, one night, no overthinking, just try to get something online. So I basically just Googled how to start an online store, listed out the products I wanted to try, did a quick and very rough market check, and then used genstore to put together a store page. I don’t really know much about building websites, but while I was searching I realized a lot of this stuff can be auto generated now, so I just went ahead and made a rough first version instead of overthinking it. It wasn’t perfect. The copy needs work, product selection is probably bad, and I’m sure a real ecommerce person would roast it. But when I saw an actual storefront with my idea on it, at like 12:30am on a Thursday, it felt oddly motivating.\n\nI’m still figuring out whether this thing even deserves more time. But something about having a live site makes me more willing to keep going the next night instead of starting from zero again. \n\nSo if there’s a side hustle you’ve been thinking about, maybe don’t overthink it too much. Start while the excitement is still there, even if it’s not perfect, and adjust as you go. Really believe you’ll get something out of it.",

Last week my dad asked for something he thought could make his workflow easier. So I built a simple QR tracking system for his company (plus a couple of extra features). It’s just a basic MVP, no landing page, no real auth (only invite-based access), no polish. But it does what it’s supposed to do.\n\nAnd unexpectedly, 3 other companies reached out asking if they could also use it. I ended up selling all of them a yearly plan ($199/y).\n\nI’ve never experienced something like this before. We grind constantly, try to follow best practices, iterate, polish, try to post a banger tweet or whatever… And yet this simple, single-purpose, not-very-fancy product somehow sells itself. It’s wild. I always see posts saying “it’s not the product, it’s distribution,” and I’m sure they’re right for my game dev products, but in this case things played out differently.\n\nI guess sometimes solving one real problem for someone is enough. I need to remind myself of that.",

There's something satisfying about seeing a driveway go from grimy to clean in real-time. You're outside, moving around, and you can literally see your progress.\nThe people interaction is actually one of the best parts. Most customers are homeowners who want to chat - about their house, their yard plans, neighborhood stuff. Just honest conversations.in my experience, not Zoom fatigue. And when they see the results, they get genuinely excited. My biggest surprise: the business side is way less screen-heavy than I expected. I do some online booking/invoicing, but it's maybe 30 minutes of admin for every 3-4 hours of actual work.\nIf you want purely hands-on, look at services where the \"done\" is obvious: pressure washing, lawn care, house cleaning, gutters, pool cleaning, junk removal. People love seeing the before/after in person. Satisfying for both them and me.",

Around March 2025 I decided to organize what I was already reading into a simple format, mainly for myself at first, just to reduce the mental overhead.\n\nOver time a few people asked if they could follow along, so I kept it going. It takes around 8 to 10 hours a week and only works because I batch everything and stick to a routine. The first few months had almost no traction, but the structure itself was useful so I didn’t stop.\n\nMost of the early growth came from being helpful in relevant threads rather than sharing links. Narrowing the focus helped a lot. Things like Twitter and SEO never really worked for me. The biggest challenge now is keeping up with it alongside a full time job and figuring out whether it’s worth continuing to invest more time into it or keep it lightweight.\n\nCurious if anyone else here has turned something they already do daily into a side project and how you decided how far to take it.\n\nEDIT : On the rebrand part. Original look was generic Canva template, tried Midjourney but text was inconsistent. Ended up using X-Design which is built for branding, took 90 mins for logo and headers. Conversion went from 1.2% to 3.8% after looking more professional. Worth fixing if your side hustle has any visual component.\n\n",

You still need to watch loan originators, understand how buyback works, and accept that liquidity can disappear when market sentiment changes.\n\nOn the positive side, cash flow is more predictable than stocks and volatility feels lower on the surface. On the negative side, platform risk is very real and trust matters more than headline returns.\n\nToday I keep P2P as a single-digit percentage of my total portfolio and treat it as a satellite allocation rather than a core holding.\n\n I am curious how others here structure their P2P exposure.",

          "body": "Freelancing advice usually fails because it starts with platforms instead of skills. With your background, I’d look at work that values thinking and structure over hustle, things like research assistance, survey design, curriculum development, literature reviews, or qualitative analysis. Those map cleanly to your degrees and are easier to explain to clients than generic “freelance work.” Start by packaging one narrow service you could deliver in a week, not “I can do lots of things.” Once you have that, finding clients becomes a targeting problem instead of an identity crisis. Task apps can help short term, but long term, you’ll earn more by selling thinking, not hours.",

      "selftext": "I’m finally going to start doing this as a side hustle and despite the mixed reviews online, I see great earning potential. \n\nHowever, in Florida, it’s not legal to go around and sell anything without a permit, and many high traffic areas (beaches, parks, events) don’t allow soliciting at all. \n\nI came up with the idea to accept optional donations/tips. I think if I mention it most would offer, but if they don’t it’s not a big deal.\n\nWhat do you think? Florida is pretty strict but can they really do anything about me offering people pictures? I don’t think it’s shady, but it may seem that way. \n\nAny advice on this would be appreciated!\n\n",

Still making $350/month.\n\n# The Setup\n\n**Step 1: Find a problem** Scrolled through Facebook groups and Reddit in \\[niche\\]. Found a problem people kept asking about repeatedly.\n\n**Step 2: Create the PDF** Took 1 hour to write a comprehensive guide solving that specific problem. Used AI to help format and structure it. Nothing fancy - just clear solutions.\n\n**Step 3: Build a landing page** Used an AI website builder (just gave it a prompt like \"create a landing page to sell a PDF about X\"). Took 1 hour to get it looking right. Added:\n\n* Headline describing the problem\n* What's inside the PDF\n* Price ($9)\n* Stripe payment button\n* Automated email delivery after purchase\n\n**Step 4: Post it once** Dropped it in a few relevant communities where people have that problem. Got initial traction.\n\n**Step 5: Forget about it** All sales now come from:\n\n* Word of mouth\n* People searching for solutions\n* Zero marketing from me\n\n# Why this works\n\n* One-time effort (2 hours total)\n* AI makes both PDF and landing page creation fast\n* Stripe + automated email = no manual work\n* Low price point ($9) = easy impulse buy\n* Solves real problem = people pay\n\n# The numbers\n\n* Initial work: 1 hour creating PDF + 1 hour for landing page\n* Ongoing work: 0 hours/month\n* Monthly revenue: $350/month\n* Startup cost: $0\n* Tech stack: AI tools + Stripe + automated email\n\n# The truth about \"passive\"\n\nFirst month required some marketing. After that, truly passive. Sales happen automatically from organic discovery.\n\nSmall niche = limited scale. But $350/month for 2 hours of work isn't bad.\n\n# For anyone wanting to try this\n\n1. Find a problem people actively search for solutions to\n2. Create a clear, actionable PDF with AI help (don't overthink it)\n3. Use AI to build a simple landing page (literally just describe what you want)\n4. Set up Stripe payment + automated delivery\n5. Post in 2-3 relevant places\n6. Let organic discovery take over\n\nThe key: solve a real problem people are already looking for answers to.",

I see one problem with this - competition.  All these methods have one thing in common - they work on theory but they don't work in real life.  You have to heavily promote , spam and probably pay for fb ads. Today there are only a few methods that work - I am afraid this is not one of them. This method would need to have a kw research, seo optimization throughout the text and landing page and it takes way more than two hours.

          "body": "The biggest Problem with selling any digital products and especially something so simple like a PDF guide is the selling part. \n\nPeople always jump over the fact that you can't just copy paste stuff from AI tool and start selling it. Plus the marketing part such as ads or even organic traffic isn't going to turn to success on it's own. \n\nAll these posts of people making 6 figures with AI or digital marketing are too exaggerated and clickbait. I get it they do it for controversy, views and engagement, etc..But it's really annoying and makes people question everything!\n\nAnd by the time you find something interesting or worth trying out, you are already too burned out and afraid of falling for the same scam yet again.\n\nFrom my own personal research of building digital products both PDF, E-book and courses, I can easily say just from building part you have like 30 steps that you have to go through one way or the other. And just to mention that marketing and promoting comes as an extra steps on top of it all.\n\nSo, while some people got lucky and made their first few sale's with only Chatgpt most of us spend ton of time and money doing it properly. I am not saying here you can't make money without investing money or spending the least amount of time on your products but I am saying those are rare situations where people actually make it that way. \n\nJust for reference the proper way of selling digital products online include:\n1. Researching the audience/demand \n2. Researching the competition (competitor brands, business, agency's, etc...)\n3. Figuring out your product (everything from what product is supposed to be, what problems it solves and how it transformers people or their situation, etc...)\n4. Product creation (How to write, film or design your product, how to edit and put together everything, what tools you need to do all that, etc...)\n5. Figuring out market channels (where are you going to sell your product, how are you going to package it, which format, paid or free advertising or both, etc...)\n6. Content Creation if using free traffic or Facebook ads, YouTube ads, Google ads if using Paid Advertising. \n7. Consistency &amp; Growth (How are you going to connect everything and make it sustainable and long term without losing traction and how to scale it later on)\n\nAnd these are just some of the things that real business owners and content creators have to know and be able to use to reach that success that everyone has been bragging about. If we really wanted to go all in there are all kinds of important stuff still needed like AI understanding, SEO, Email Marketing, Social Media Marketing, etc... \n\nP.S This post is from my own personal experience and research that I have been doing for last 10 years.

They want new ones but they’re terrified of one thing: being trapped.\n\nTraditional agencies charge $3000 upfront, then $200 every time you want to change your hours or update a price.\n\nBusiness owners hate this. They want control.\n\nThe Solution: \n\nGoogle Sheet Connection\n\nWebsites that pull data from a Google Sheet.\n\nWhen the business owner edits the spreadsheet (changes hours, updates prices, adds services)\n\nThey edit a spreadsheet. Website updates instantly.\n\nAfter validating manually (got 10 sales in the first month), built automation that runs daily:\n\nEvery day automatically:\n\n\t1.\tLead generation: Google Maps API finds 1000 businesses with outdated websites\n\n\t2.\tSite building: AI generates professional sites using their business info\n\n\t3.\tSheet setup: Apps Script connects each site to a Google Sheet\n\n\t4.\tVideo creation: Tool generates personalized demo videos\n\n\t5.\tOutreach: Email automation sends demos to all 1000 businesses\n\nMarket is massive.

If the OP is only making $500/day, he is running a charity, not a business.\n* Sending 1,000 cold emails daily with video links or attachments is the fastest way to get your domain blacklisted by Google and Outlook. You aren't reaching \"1,000 plumbers\"; you’re reaching 1,000 spam folders.\n* Selling a website for a one-time fee of $500 sounds great until the client accidentally deletes a cell in their Google Sheet and breaks the site. You aren't \"passive\"—you're a 24/7 tech support line for 300+ non-tech-savvy business owners.\n*  AI-generated sites are \"thin content.\" A plumber doesn't want a pretty site; they want calls. If this site doesn't rank on Page 1 (which it won't without real SEO work), the plumber will ask for a refund in 30 days.\n\nThis BS isn't a \"business system.\" It’s a \"Lead Magnet.\" Usually, the person posting this is about to sell a course, a \"mastermind,\" or an affiliate link to the AI tools they are \"using.\"",

      "selftext": "Posting this because one of my comments in another thread in this sub unexpectedly blew up and a bunch of people asked me how I ended up here. I thought it was a great opportunity to do an AMA, so here we are.\n\nMy story started as a management consultant in Canada during COVID. I worked at a lower mid market consulting firm, but the pay was honestly not great for the hours and the grind (carrot and stick) never really clicked for me.\n\nWhen Covid hit, I did what a lot of people did and tried to build something online. I did a bunch of research on Youtube and decided to I should launch a dropshipping business selling an ergonomic product. It failed for the many reasons a lot of you probably experienced. Supplier was unreliable, shipping was a mess cause of COVID, and I was learning Meta ads, Google ads, and ecomm operations all at once. Looking back, it was exactly what you would expect from a beginner trying to learn everything in real time and trying to master global supply chains during a global pandemic. Painful, but it forced me to actually understand paid traffic and conversion, which ended up mattering later.\n\nA few months after that, I came across a Twitter thread about local services booming. Plumbers, electricians, cleaners. People in trades making serious money. I brushed it off. We had just lived through COVID and the idea of strangers in homes still felt uncomfortable. Then a few days later I saw another tweet (gotta thank the Twitter algo for that or else I wouldn’t be where I am today). A girl my age sharing her story about running a remote cleaning business. No cleaning herself, just managing demand and cleaners. It sounded almost too simple, which made me skeptical. I DM’d her, we had a short back and forth, and she pointed me to a resource that made everything click and work for her. It was a course from an ex Wall Street guy who built and scaled his own remote cleaning business. I obviously did not buy anything right away. I had never bought a course in my life and was still in the mindset of having to do more research and “If he did it, I can figure this out myself”. That said, I signed up for their free content and started reading the emails. The free content and emails broke the model down in a way that made it click + paired with my own research I understood this was legit and not some other online business trap. I eventually bought the course. I am not going to promote it here, but I do want to give credit where it is due. The material and the free 1:1 calls that came with the course with the person running it genuinely changed the trajectory for me from that point on.\n\nThings moved fast. It took me about 20 days to set everything up. In hindsight, it could have taken a week. I am naturally skeptical, and skepticism is the enemy of action so I kept double checking things, doing extra research, and trying to disprove the model and what was being taught. Ironically, the more I did that, the more I realized how simple and underserved the cleaning market actually is and how all the steps make perfect sense.\n\nChoosing a market to open up shop in ended up being straightforward. The rule of thumb is pretty simple: avoid massive cities like Miami or LA. Too competitive, too many sophisticated players, lots of illegal labor. Focus on smaller cities and towns with decent population and income (there are A LOT of them). Anything under 1 million people is great, closer to 500k is ideal. The idea is to be a big fish in a small pond. As part of the selection framework you should also be looking for markets where the biggest cleaning company barely has a functional website and maybe 30 Google reviews mot. Once you find a market like that (there are plenty), you then show up with a good brand, modern looking website with online booking, and great client experience.\n\nPersonally, I picked a market and have never expanded outside of it because demand still feels endless. Cities with high rental turnover are especially good. Student towns with colleges are gold. Landlords do not clean themselves. They will pay $400 to 600 for move out cleans without hesitation. Even today, about 20-30% of our monthly revenue comes from moving related cleans. Higher ticket, easier to execute since homes are empty.\n\nFinding cleaners is usually the biggest bottleneck and the only real stress you’ll have throughout your journey. You almost always have more demand than supply, which is a GREAT problem to have, but turning down clients because your cleaners are all too busy strings. In reality, it was a me problem because I was not approaching it well. I was relying only on job boards but once I started posting in local Facebook groups, I unlocked A LOT of new applicants and found several awesome teams that allowed me to scale. A piece of advice I am very glad I did follow though was hiring cleaners before launching any ads. Finding clients was the moment where everything became real. The first two cleaners I hired are still with me today. I have always been extremely selective during the hiring process, which is what I was taught to do, and that felt uncomfortable at first, but is the right thing to do. Once you stop trying to rush this step and find the best channels for your local market, the whole thing becomes much smoother.\n\nWe landed our first client on the first day we launched ads. A biweekly client paying $140 booked online. I remember being nervous dispatching the first cleaner, waiting to see if something would go wrong. Well.. the clean went great! Payment processed after the clean and I personally called the client, thanked them, and asked for a 5-star review, explaining we were early and it really helped. He left one and has been a client ever since. He is grandfathered into that pricing forever. I will do almost anything to never lose him because of how symbolic that first full loop was.\n\nThat first month we closed seven more clients, including a few one time deep cleans. At that point I was fully hooked.\n\nHere are my rough revenue numbers, month by month.\n\nMonth 1: 3.4k  \nMonth 2: 5.2k  \nMonth 3: 7.8k  \nMonth 4: 11.5k  \nMonth 5: 14.9k  \nMonth 6: 18.3k  \nMonth 7: 22.1k  \nMonth 8: 26.7k  \nMonth 9: 31.4k  \nMonth 10: 35.9k  \nMonth 11: 38.2k  \nMonth 12: 42.6k  \nMonth 13: 39.8k  \nMonth 14: 44.1k  \nMonth 15: 48.9k  \nMonth 16: 52.3k  \nMonth 17: 58.7k  \nMonth 18: 57.4k  \nMonth 19: 55.2k  \nMonth 20: 55.0k\n\nRoughly 60% of revenue is recurring. The rest are one time deep cleans or post renovation cleanups (we got into this a few months in). We do 0 commercial right now. I want to add it this year because higher ticket recurring contracts could realistically double the business.\n\nAbout 4 months ago, I hired my first virtual assistant in the Philippines. It took about a month to fully onboard and train her. She now runs the day to day operations (not easy to “let go” but 100% worth it). I spend about an hour a day on the business, sometimes less because I only step in for rare edge cases, escalations, or when she has a question (we just text). That was the moment the business truly felt passive and not just location independent in theory. Having a high % of my business being recurring helps with the transition as things are already rolling.\n\nTwo mistakes I made early on: 1)  I underestimated how much Google reviews matter. I automated review requests and it worked, but once I started personally following up with texts and occasionally calling clients, reviews grew much faster. We were already ranking top 3 locally due to low competition, but reviews massively increased organic bookings. 2) I waited too long to raise prices. Early on I was uncomfortable charging over $50/hr. Once I realized I had more demand than supply, I raised prices to an effective $60-65/hr depending on the job. Almost no negative impact. Demand kept coming in.\n\nHappy to answer anything.\n\nEDIT (7/1): Cleaners are all independent subcontractors. I have 0 employees on payroll. They bring their own equipment and supplies (which is factored into their rate which is far above market).\n\nEDIT 2 (11/1): Thanks for the overwhelming response and all the DMs. I did not expect this post to travel the way it did.\n\nA heads up as this has been brought to my attention: there are bad actors taking advantage of the visibility of this thread and DMing people with scams. Please do not click on random links, Discord invites, or “done for you” offers. If someone is pushing urgency or asking for large upfront payments, be careful. I am also NOT interested in any consulting work nor any partnership, thus anyone claiming to be part of my “team” is lying to you. In the early hours of this post I have only replied to a handful of people who DM’d me first. I will NOT DM anyone first. If someone reaches out to you claiming to be me, do not trust it. \n\nSince so many people asked directly, I will answer this once and leave it here.\n\nThe resource I used is called Cleaning CEO University and the instructor was (is still?) named Sam. I’m not affiliated and I’m not promoting any link in public. Also, for transparency, when I joined it cost $699. It looks like it is now priced at $997. I have not gone through the content in over a year, so I cannot comment on any new material that may have been added. They also changed the name at some point, it used to be called Remote Cleaning University.\n\nWas it worth it for me? Yes. Clearly. I made roughly $1.3k in profit in month one and continued to grow from there. That said, I also put in the work, followed the process, and did not try to cut corners.\n\nIs it worth it for you? I genuinely do not know, and I cannot answer that. Please do your own research and make your own decision. A course will never do the work for you and while this is very likely one of the better ones, you’ll need to put in work.\n\nNow, what I do know for sure is that anyone DMing you offering $10k “full implementation” programs, random Discord servers, or pushing other resources aggressively is trying to take advantage of the attention around this thread and the fact that I was initially hesitant to name anything.\n\nStay cautious. ",

I own  a cleaning company too and it is not just 1 hour work and it is certainly not passive income.\nIt is a real business and you have to treat it like one.\n\n1. Hiring (reliable) cleaners is a nightmare.\n\n2. Ads will cut too deep into your budget.\n\n3. Margins get thinner because you are paying your cleaners well. \n\nEven if you make 100$ per job. 30$ goes into ads so basically you are making 50-70$ per job\n\nOn top of that some clients will not pay, some will pay half the amount because they were not satisfied. Etc etc etc.\n\n\nSo as i said, it is easier said than done. It is a sweaty startup not passive income and people should know this.",

I wanted to address one question that came up most often:\n\nWhat if the market I'm interested in already has a bunch of players with decent websites and a bunch of reviews?\n\nThe answer is that it doesn't matter. Just avoid shitshow markets like New York or LA. This market is so big that demand feels never-ending. There are countless cities and towns across the US or whatever country you're located in. If you're the number 10 player in the market and you're making $40k or more in revenue a month, well, who cares? You're literally making $40k or more. Ideally, you want to find a market that is underpenetrated, but trust me, most of the companies that have over 100 reviews with a decent website and running operations making over $2M are operated by amateurs or people that are not even picking up the phone half the time. Also, they have A LOT of overhead so far less flexibility and margin to play with than we do. The opportunity is endless, just execute marginally better than them and you will take market share VERY quickly.",

I’m based in Europe and thinking of either doing it here or some higher-income country. I speak 7 languages and have 7 years background in advertising. But I wonder, have you thought about expanding to other locations to expand the business? \n2. How do you hire cleaners? Ads? Job portals? Facebook groups? \n3. What kind of clients bring the most business and are easiest to work with? Which channels are bringing them for you? \n4. I would love to also know about the course. Although i’m a bit skeptical like you and thinking of looking at youtube first and perhaps ChatGPT as an assistant in setting it up. \n\nThanks so much for this post. You honestly inspired me to try this out. I feel like it is also applicable to other trade industries so I can always pivot in case it doesn’t work or gets automated with AI/robot cleaners. \n\nI know you probably get a lot of DMs but I if you find the time, would love to get the course to start working on it. \n\nI’m really keen on starting my own business. If there is a way for us to work together I would love that. Have you thought about selling a blueprint of your model? Alex Hormozi did this with his gym opening model. Made 50 mil selling that business after. \n\nAnyway, appreciate your post so much!",

She told her friend at church about it and next thing I know I have 3 more people asking me to do it.\n\nI bought a decent video capture device on Amazon (the Elgato one, around $80) and started posting on local Facebook groups. Turns out theres SO many boomers and gen x folks who have boxes of old tapes, camcorder videos, and even those weird mini DV tapes sitting in their garage that they want digitized but have no idea how to do it.\n\nI charge $15 per tape for VHS and $20 for camcorder tapes cause they take a bit longer. Most people have like 10 to 30 tapes so the jobs add up quick. December was insane cause everyone wanted them done before the holidays, made around $950 that month. Its slowed down a bit now but still getting steady work.\n\nI can literally just let the tapes run while I'm working my regular job from home or watching TV. I also upload everything to a google drive folder for them and burn it to a DVD if they want (extra $5). Some people tip really well too cause they get emotional seeing their old family videos.\n\nNow I actually have $2k set aside, but I'm kinda stuck on how to scale this up beyond just me doing it. I can only run like 2 or 3 tapes at a time with my current setup. Anyone have ideas on how to grow this without it turning into a full time thing? Or should I just keep it small and steady?",

      "selftext": "So right now I make roughly between $857-$900/month renting out washers and dryers COMPLETLEY remotley.\n\nI've never seen these washers and dryers in person EVER, or even know HOW to operate a washer/dryer (yes i'm a screenager).\n\nSo I saw this video on youtube from this youtube channel that was interviewing this dude that makes like 50k/month renting out washers and dryers (revenue only) but he does all of the maintence/repairs and delivery so his margins are pretty high. If i had to guess he probably inflated his numbers in some way to sell a shiny object syndrome dream because he has a skool community course that he sells but the business that he operates is for sure profitable.\n\nThe other caviot is that he has his own trailor/scrap yard for storage/hauling, and used to work as a dryer/washer repair tech so all of his repairs are \"free\" (done by him). I don't have any of that but I could defintley afford it (I have 57k in savings from other side hustles and some luck).\n\nThe whole video wasn't SUPER helpful, besides the facebook marketplace segment, where the guy showcases how he does his FREE organic advertising on facebook to do 50k/month in RV, and as someone who has multiple accounts on facebook listing washer and dryer rentals, I can vouch that I get over 30+ inquiries a day from 5 facebook account and don't usually have time/forget to respond to prospects. (im in texas)\n\nSince I didnt have a truck or storage unit, I cold called a few washer and dryer wholesellers on google maps and worked out an agreement, I know its a killer deal but he charges me $400 for a SET of washers and dryers (amanas and whirlpools), and $50 to INSTALL them. (Yes I've been told by many people that this is a crazy deal), and he also doesn't charge me for storage if anyone ever defaults and I have no where else to send my washers and dryers too.\n\nRight now, I've been sitting on a set of 6 washers and dryers and do a \"rent to own\" business model, in which most people default out of. Here are my payment options:\n\n$104/month rent to own for 12 months (nobody gets this)\n\n$80/month rent to own for 18 months (8 people have this)\n\n$65/month rent to own for 24 months (2 people have this)\n\nOne thing I have noticed is that people DO screw you over in this business model, but it usually is not TOO terrible.\n\nThe only time I have been screwed over is when I had a few people sign a contract for a 1 or 2 year lease on the washer or dryer and they default after the FIRST month because they ran out of money (which is destined in this market segment), or they bought their own washer and dryer (wtf???)\n\nSo another thing I do is charge DOUBLE the security deposit, so if someone asks for $80/month, I charge them $160 for delivery and install (everything is through stripe). This obviously leads to fewer conversions but there are still ALOT of people out there that will be more than willing to pay $160 for the delivery and install. ($80 one time payment, $80 reccuring payment). This removes all risk for THIS instance because my maximum downside is $100 ($50 for the install and $50 for my delivery guy to remove it). Obviously there is a risk of them just \"stealing\" the washer and dryer, which is ALOT more likley because of the targeted market segment (low income people).\n\nI've never gotten a washer or dryer \"stolen\", it's just not something that happens, but if it does happen, I told each customer that I have a kill switch on them (I don't but I'm sure this deters them from doing so)however I know this is defintely NOT full proof and I am brainstorming a solution. (I'm sure its not super hard to set up). I've cycled through 18 people over the course of the last 5 months, and as I said earlier, I still profit $60 even if I get screwed on the first month.\n\nI've been doing this for 5 months now so my sets JUST broke even (not by that much), so next month will be my first month of REAL profit.\n\nHere is my \"funnel\" or so you call it.\n\nCustomer reaches out on facebook marketplace ---&gt; I send them the prices ---&gt;they pick an option and then typically ask for same day delivery --&gt; I collect their address and number, call them then charge them a premium for same day delivery --&gt; I send them the payment portal to pay the double deposit (some customers prefer to do it when we are on site but I always try to do it before i dispatch my delivery guy) --&gt; I dispatch my delivery guy --&gt; delivery guy installs washer and dryer.--&gt; I send customer contract.\n\nSome more general tips:\n\n\\-MAKE SURE that the customer pays you MORE than what it costs for you to deliver and repo the unit if you are doing it through a third party like I did.\n\n\\-facebook market place is your BEST friend, please do not pay for ANY advertising.\n\n\\-get on the phone with the customer to build trust (nobody is going to send you $160 from just texting)\n\n\\-Call at LEAST 5 washer/dryer wholesellers to get the best prices on USED sets.\n\nI'm thinking about scaling another 10 or so washer and dryer sets over the next 3 months and implmenting ACTUAL kill switches (this will be the first time I ever see any of my washer and dryers).\n\nEdit: I believe this constitutes as passive income because after all of the set up(phone calls, messaging, document signing), it’s hands off) ",

The game was good; it was noticed by the Play Store (4.5 stars) and I got several Google featuring (Editor’s Choice / Adventure). Whenever Google featured it, I saw a spike in downloads and sales. The features typically lasted from about a week to a month. As soon as the featuring stopped, I dropped back down to a very low number of sales.\n\nMy game was free-to-play (with ads), with a paid option (premium, no ads). Replayability was low (two things I would definitely change if I were to release a narrative game again). In short, the Play Store is extremely competitive — you get pushed out quickly in favor of new games. If I had managed to sustain $600 a week, I would have been the happiest developer.",

      "selftext": "I work a pretty boring corporate job in logistics. good salary but soul crushing. always wanted to do something creative on the side but honestly I have zero interest in being on camera. like none. my face is not going on the internet, period. so I spent a lot of time researching faceless content and kept seeing people talk about AI generated stuff.\n\nthe idea came from my girlfriend actually. she follows a ton of fashion accounts on instagram and pointed out that some of them looked kinda off. like the models were too perfect or the lighting was weird. turned out a bunch of them were using AI generated images. that got me thinking.\n\nso around january last year I decided to start a fitness motivation account. yeah I know, super saturated niche. but I figured the content would be easier to create since its mostly just aesthetic photos with motivational quotes. nothing groundbreaking.\n\nthe first three months were rough. I was using midjourney and some other tools to generate fitness model images but the problem was consistency. every image looked like a different person. followers would comment stuff like “who is this” or “thought this was a different girl” and it killed any sense of brand identity. I almost quit around month two because the engagement was terrible and I was spending like 2 hours a day just trying to get usable images.\n\nmonth four I started experimenting with different approaches. tried a bunch of tools like APOB, artbreeder, and some others I found on reddit. the game changer was figuring out how to maintain a consistent character across posts. once I locked in “her” look (athletic build, dark hair, mid 20s vibe) things started clicking. people actually started following because they thought they were following a real person’s fitness journey.\n\nthe content strategy was simple. post once a day, always the same “person” in different workout settings or athleisure outfits. gym shots, outdoor runs, yoga poses, that kind of thing. captions were either motivational quotes or fake personal stories about “my” fitness journey. felt a little weird at first writing in first person as this fictional character but honestly nobody questioned it.\n\nmonth six I hit 8k followers which qualified me for some micro influencer platforms. got my first brand deal for $75 to post about a protein powder. the brand sent product shots and I just had to incorporate their messaging. easy money for like 20 minutes of work.\n\nthe income breakdown right now at month 11:\n\nbrand deals: averaging about $280/month. I get maybe 4 to 5 offers per month, accept 2 or 3 that actually fit the account aesthetic. pay ranges from $50 to $120 per post depending on the brand.\n\naffiliate links: around $60/month from amazon associates. I link workout gear and supplements in my bio and stories. conversion rate is garbage honestly but it adds up.\n\nso total is roughly $340/month. not quitting my job money but considering I spend maybe 45 minutes a day on it now (batch creating content on sundays helps a lot), the hourly rate is decent.\n\nthe hard parts nobody talks about:\n\nfirst, the guilt. there are real fitness influencers grinding every day, actually working out, filming themselves, and here I am with a fake person getting brand deals. I’ve made peace with it because the brands know what they’re getting (I’m transparent that its an AI persona when they ask directly) but it still feels weird sometimes.\n\nsecond, the technical learning curve. getting consistent faces, good lighting, realistic poses took forever to figure out. my first hundred images were unusable. hands still look weird sometimes and I have to regenerate a lot.\n\nthird, engagement farming. you still have to actually engage with followers, respond to DMs, comment on other accounts. the content creation might be automated but the community building isn’t. I probably spend more time on engagement than actual content creation.\n\nthings I wish I knew earlier:\n\npick a niche where the AI aesthetic actually works. fitness, fashion, travel photography all work well because people expect polished, professional looking images. something like “day in my life” content would be way harder to fake convincingly.\n\ndon’t cheap out on the tools. I wasted two months using free generators that produced obvious AI garbage. the paid tools cost money but the quality difference is massive.\n\ntreat it like a real business from day one. I set up a separate email, separate instagram account obviously, and track everything in a spreadsheet. revenue, costs, time spent, engagement rates. helps you figure out what’s actually working.\n\nthe future plan is to expand to tiktok with short form video content. some of the newer tools can do image to video stuff that looks pretty convincing. already tested a few clips and the engagement seems promising. if I can crack video content, the brand deal rates go up significantly.\n\nalso thinking about starting a second account in a different niche. maybe home decor or cooking. the playbook is pretty repeatable once you figure it out.\n\nthe monthly time investment now is probably around 12 to 15 hours total. sundays I batch create 20 to 30 images for the week, schedule them out, then just check in daily for engagement. compared to the 40 plus hours I was putting in at the beginning, it finally feels somewhat passive.\n\nstill have a decent emergency fund saved up from my day job so worst case if the account gets banned tomorrow I’m not ruined. but so far instagram hasn’t flagged anything and the follower growth has been steady at about 800 to 1000 new followers per month.\n\nthe whole experience taught me that passive income is never truly passive at the start. the first six months were basically a part time job that paid nothing. but now that the systems are in place and the account has momentum, the effort to income ratio finally makes sense.",

After 4 years of testing different side hustles, I’ve finally realized that the secret to success in 2026 is building high-value, low-friction digital products.\n\nSince I just had my first few sales on my breakdown today, I wanted to pass on 14 specific lessons I've learned to help you guys get a head start:\n\n1. **Solve \"Micro-Pain\" Points:** Don't solve a life problem; solve a 2-hour problem.\n2. **Prioritize Clarity over Length:** A 10-page guide that works is better than a 100-page book that is confusing.\n3. **The \"Coffee\" Price Point:** Selling for a low price is the \"sweet spot\" for impulse buys and building trust quickly.\n4. **Validation First:** Don't spend a month building. Spend 48 hours on a \"Version 1\" to see if anyone wants it.\n5. **Use \"Social Proof\":** Once you get your first sale, tell people! It shows your product is real and working.\n6. **Focus on Workflows:** Passive income isn't a \"set it and forget it\" magic trick; it's a repeatable system.\n7. **Organize your \"Digital Office\":** Separate your brainstorming time from your execution time to avoid burnout.\n8. **Build for 2026:** People want fast, actionable roadmaps, not long-winded theory.\n9. **Be Transparent:** If you use tools like AI to help you, be honest about it. Authenticity is a superpower on Reddit.\n10. **Community is King:** Provide 10x more value in comments than you do in your sales pitch.\n11. **The \"Loop\" over the \"Launch\":** Don't just launch and stop. Every customer question is a clue for your next update. Improving your product based on real feedback is what creates long-term passive income.\n12. **Own Your Traffic:** Don't just rely on one platform. Use social media to drive people to a simple landing page or email list. This way, you aren't at the mercy of an algorithm change.\n13. **Compound Your Assets:** One guide is a side hustle; five guides are a business. Once you find a workflow that works, repeat it for different \"Micro-Pain\" points in the same niche.\n14. **Focus on \"Evergreen\" Value:** Trends die fast. Solve a problem that people will still have 12 months from now. That is the difference between a quick buck and a steady income stream.\n\n**I've pinned the full 11-page breakdown on my Reddit profile for anyone who wants the deep dive (I put it there to keep this feed clean!).** I’m happy to chat in the comments if you have questions!\n\n**Note on this post:** I used AI to help me structure and write this post so that it is easy to read and the information is presented clearly for everyone.\n\n*(Disclaimer: The link on my profile leads to my personal digital product for beginners).*",

Most people make it sound like if you’re not rich by 25 you’ve failed, but that’s just not real life.\n\nOP, the average business owner actually starts around 40. Social media loves pushing the young rich outliers because it gets clicks, not because it’s normal. You genuinely have time. The good thing is you’re aware of it and you’re trying to change things. That already puts you ahead.\n\nIf I had one suggestion, it would be to put as much time as possible into learning. But not learning what you think you should learn. Learn what actually energizes you. That matters more than people admit. I found a bunch of resources along the way too, like this newsletter https://wealthrewired.beehiiv.com which helped me reframe how I thought about growth and time.\n\nAt one point I literally gave myself a learning budget. I let myself spend money on books, newsletters, courses, whatever helped me move forward. Amazon books, trends.co which was about $300 a year, theadvault.co.uk which is free. I didn’t care what the format was, I just needed momentum.\n\nFor context, my first job after college was in music after I ran out of money as a music producer and had to pivot. I was making about $35k a year in LA which was nowhere near enough to live. While working there I started experimenting with online businesses on the side. After some trial and error I had a couple small wins, then my company found out and didn’t like me building things on the side. I went back to work, hid my projects honestly, but kept going because I enjoyed it. Eventually I got good enough at coding to leave for a job I liked more, paid me double, and let me keep building side projects.\n\nI’ve felt lost more times than I can count. That feeling doesn’t mean you’re failing. Use it as fuel, keep learning, and stay focused on what actually pulls you forward.",

      "selftext": "So this might sound weird, but hear me out.\n\nYou know how everyone's always looking for that perfect passive income stream? Well, I think Roblox development might actually be it.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* 350M+ users, mostly kids with disposable Robux (their currency)\n* One-click purchases built into the platform\n* Games can generate revenue 24/7 once published\n* Low barrier to entry with AI coding tools now\n\nI started experimenting with [Rebirth](https://userebirth.com/), an AI tool that helps you code Roblox games. It automatically tests and debugs, so you don't need to be a programming wizard.\n\nThe crazy part? A simple game called \"Escape Tsunami For Brainrots!\" has 350K concurrent players. It looks super basic but kids LOVE it.\n\nOnce your game is up, it runs itself. Kids buy in-game items, game passes, and premium features with their allowance money (Robux). You cash out through Roblox's DevEx program. Blowing up as well is just ONE tiktok video.\n\nNot saying it's \"get rich quick\" but compared to other passive income ideas I've tried (dropshipping, print-on-demand, etc.), this actually has real earning potential with an audience that's EAGER to spend. \n\nHas anyone else tried this? What's been your experience? ",

Finding clients is easy. I’ve had to raise my prices to the point where I won’t even consider anything under $10k/month base fee + commission.\n\nAnd you don’t have to work only with influencers.

High-ticket stuff like your $300k units, B2B SaaS, or done-for-you agencies can all afford $10k/month + performance if you can prove ROAS in 60–90 days.\n\n\n\nIf someone wants to follow a similar path, I’d focus on: 1) one traffic source (YouTube ads, TikTok ads, or SEO), 2) one funnel type (lead gen → sales call or webinar → call), and 3) one niche where you can stack 3–5 case studies fast.\n\n\n\nTools-wise, I’ve bounced between GoHighLevel for the plumbing and ConvertKit/Klaviyo for email, plus Pulse for Reddit to mine real objections and language from niche subreddits so the funnel copy hits harder.\n\n\n\nMain point: specialize in turning attention into revenue and you’ll never struggle to find work.",

      "selftext": "I honestly feel like an idiot for quitting my facebook page three years ago. At the time, I thought the golden era was over, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The best time to start was then, but honestly, the second-best time is right now while everyone else is distracted by other platforms. I really think this is one of the best things to hop on in the next few years.\n\nI’m currently sitting on three pages, two in the animal niche and one on spirituality, and the momentum is starting to get crazy. Two of them already reached 11k and 13k followers just by hitting the first viral content. My roadmap for 2026 is to scale this up to 8-10 pages and hit $10k a month in 99% automated passive revenue.\n\nMost people don't realize that Facebook is the best platform for automated content because they don't actually care if you're posting via a third-party app or the official page. As long as the content is good and people are engaging, they wll push it. Thats the secret sauce that lets you automate the whole thing. Have not seen that on any other platform.\n\nI’m currently running a super simple ad strategy where I spend about $3 a day per page on simple page like ads. Goal is to get a new follower for under 1c. I’m consistently hitting between 1 and 2 cents per follower now, which is not too bad. When you mix that cheap, targeted growth with high quality automated content, things just start to explode.\n\nMy current workflow is about 90% automated. I wrote a python script that uses openai api for the captions and fal ai for the images, so the content literally creates itself. As soon as the script generates the post, it automatically schedules everything across all my pages through crosspostify api so I don’t even have to look at it. I just find Python more convenient for keeping the whole pipeline from idea to scheduled in one place, though you could definitely do something similar with n8n or Make if you aren't a coder. Just make sure to post 8-12 pieces of content per day and look what works. It is literally easy as that, look what works for competitor pages and try it and adjust. repeat until viral.\n\nThe only thing I’m still doing manually rn is the reels, but I’m working on automating the video production side next. Once thats dialed in, I’m launching two more niches I’ve already scouted.\n\nThe end goal is to get every single page into the content monetization program to farm the revenue. Once the traffic is there, I’ll start bridging those followers over to a dedicated website with display ads to really maximize the earnings. If you’re looking for a legit passive income play for 2026 please have a look on that thing. i genuinely think this is the single best passive income opportunity right now..",

I was in the same boat during college and wasted time chasing those \"set it and forget it\" promises.\n\nwhat actually worked for me was mixing small active stuff that didn't need upfront money. I started with user testing sites like Testio and Utest, they pay decent when you get accepted for tests but it's competitive. then I added survey apps during dead time between classes, nothing crazy but it added up to like $150-200 a month without thinking about it too much.\n\nthe key thing I learned is you gotta stack a few small things instead of looking for one perfect solution. I use Babki for surveys and game stuff during commute or when I'm just sitting around, it's newer so less crowded than the big platforms. also tried Prolific but that one's harder to get into now as a new person.\n\nfor actual passive income tho, that's a longer game. you need either money upfront or skills to build something first. don't let anyone sell you a course on it, most of that info is free on youtube anyway.",

After sharing my profile as a beginner, they sent me a 128 page English to French translation to do in 2 days.\nThis is my first translation work, so I’m not sure:\nIs this workload realistic for one person?\nCan I ethically use AI to help if I review everything?\nAnd is RWS trustworthy with payments for freelancers outside Europe/USA?\nAny advice or experiences would help!",

Besides, translating 128 pages in two days, even as an experienced translator...no.\n\nIf they promised a high pay on top of a big project without any skill testing, plus very short timeline for such a long document...that's scam.\n\n Even with AI, that is too short for a proper translation. Plus as a beginner, untrained to recognise translation pitfalls or know how to solve even common issues that you come across in translation, you are simply not a proper candidate for that size project, even if that was a real project.\n\nJust don't.\n\n If you are serious about finding such work, educate yourself by contacting local translators' associations, doing research on proper pay and proper project parameters etc. Translation is currently a minefield of low pay to no pay, so make sure you are not working for free nor for a scammer representating as a big legitimate company.",

      "selftext": "**Disclaimer:** I build in the SEO SaaS space, so yes, I’m biased. But I’m also sharing this because I wasted months following bad advice and I see the same patterns here daily.\n\n  \n**TL;DR:** Low KD, random posts and backlinks didn’t move the needle. Topical focus + intent did.\n\n  \nI started exactly like most people here.  \nWatching YouTube, reading blogs, making spreadsheets of low KD keywords, thinking “if I just publish enough, it will work.”\n\nIt didn’t. Not for a long time.\n\nWhat actually happened:  \nI ranked for some keywords.  \nGot impressions.  \nEven got traffic.  \nAnd still… no meaningful results.\n\nThat’s when I realized a few uncomfortable things.\n\nFirst: **low KD doesn’t mean good keyword.**  \nSome of the easiest keywords I targeted were also the most useless. No buying intent, no urgency, no real problem behind them. On paper they looked great. In reality they were dead.\n\nSecond: **random content doesn’t build authority.**  \nI was writing about whatever keyword I found that day. One post about X, next about Y, next about Z. To me it felt like progress. To Google it probably looked like noise. Once I stopped and went deep on one topic instead of touching ten, things slowly started making more sense.\n\nThird: **backlinks didn’t save me.**  \nYes, links matter. But they didn’t fix weak content. They didn’t fix lack of structure. They didn’t magically make Google understand my site. Cleaning up internal links and covering subtopics properly helped more than most links I chased.\n\nFourth: **most AI content is painfully obvious.**  \nI tried it. It saves time, but it also produces very generic stuff unless you heavily guide it (yes, it is possible but needs really good knowledge). Google may index it, but it doesn’t seem to trust it. You still need real depth and specifics.\n\n  \nThe biggest shift for me was this:  \nI stopped asking “how many posts should I write”  \nand started asking “what is missing for someone trying to solve this problem?”\n\nWhen I used Search Console data instead of keyword tools, and built around what was already getting impressions, things became much clearer.\n\nIf you’re grinding and feel like SEO “isn’t working”, there’s a good chance you’re not bad at it, you’re just following advice that sounds good but doesn’t map to reality.\n\nI wish someone had told me this earlier. Posting so maybe it saves someone else a few months.",

One day after a pitch meeting he made a stop at the airport because he was buying a plane (just a twin prop small 4 seat aircraft). I asked him why he was buying it and he let slip that if the company used it for 50% of the travel he could write off the entire cost of the aircraft as a corporate expense. This saved him $250k on his taxes that year. He also brought a home in Tahoe on the Nevada side and claimed he lived there 50% of the time, dropping his state taxes significantly. \n\nWhen you already have money avoiding taxes is easy and justifiable. If you pull down millions a year the savings add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Do you need it? No you don’t. Do you want to keep it regardless of need? Absolutely. Why? Because every other rich person is doing the exact same thing and if you want to keep up that’s what you do.",

      "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm in such a weird situation. I'm 38M. I grew up in Toronto Canada. I had founded a few small businesses before and exited all of them. It was after COVID, I had money in the bank. I went out to live my dream - I travelled/surfed full-time. Did not give a fuck about anything.\n\nIt was the dream life. Now, 5 years later, I get hit with a huuuuge tax bill ($100k+) from a previous transaction (real estate). It's gonna wipe out a lot of my net worth, so I can't survive on SP500/BTC anymore as I did before. \n\nI now live in Mauritius (world-class surf/kitesurf spot) but I can't legally work here. Also, it's a shit market to work in. The population is 1.3M and people are poor. It's paradise leisurely but a nightmare economically. BYOM (Bring your own money). \n\nI'm only legally allowed to work in Canada or online. \n\nI need to pull income again and refill my net worth. \n\nNo idea where to start....\n\nDo I become a plumber? I basically need to restart my career...\n\nI can start my own business again but honestly don't know what field. I haven't been in Canada for 5 years and now I'm visiting. I feel lost. I have no network....I'm a surfer dude who just came back into the Matrix after a 5-year hiatus. ",

They had the advantage of knowing both cultures and markets. So a few examples could be to marketing for travelling to where you’ve been, or even guided stuff where you live now. Or import unique or special goods from where you are to Canada (stuff that you think Canadians would pay for). So basically think about what a Canadian could use your local knowledge or contacts for, and try to capitalise on that. That sounds like your best advantage right now if you can’t stand going the normal route of just returning home and going to trade school. \n\nYou also have the story of your travel life and how you got there, surely that is worth reading about.\n\nGood luck mate!",

A lot of people are giving advice about the taxes and hopefully some of that works out. If you are truly broke, then of course find a job that will sustain you. You started businesses and sold them so you have some skills. If nothing else anyone can work in customer service/account management and make enough money to live on. If you are trying to make a little more money, sales is a great way to go. Sales of anything, companies are always looking for sales people and your experience starting businesses, traveling the world by yourself and fun adventures is going to make you a magnet to sale anything. Plus most businesses don't care too much about experience and qualifications when it comes to sales. If you have some money set aside, you could do more independent sales like real estate, insurance, etc.\n\nHowever, if you and when you can think out of the box, you have what few people have. Experience starting a business and selling it for enough money to temporarily retire. Adventures traveling the world in wonderful exotic places. Surfing skills. You can do so much with that. I don't have the exact answer and you might not either until you just do something with it. Consult with people who want to find the best places to surf. Start travel trips for landlocked urbanites who want to go to warm places and learn to surf while they are there. Teach surfing online. Teach surfing in person. Create a product online (book, course, instagram, youtube, blog) that gives info on travel requirements (visas, passports, money exchange, etc.) best places to stay, best surfing spots, how to find quiet spots not covered with tourists, best places to get surfboards, etc. Create you own travel related company by contacting places you frequented while surfing and set up referral fees for travelers who you refer to their place of business. Write a book about your experiences from building businesses, travel, learning to surf, all the way to getting hit with tax bill. The options are endless and just doing one thing will lead to another, but there are a million guys out there working as laborers or in offices but very few who did what you did, so make the most of that.",

If you work in a rural/slow area most of you time “on” is down time anyway and you can do whatever you want on a laptop computer. The pay alone is nothing crazy but it’s great benefits and steady pay to keep you afloat, and a schedule that accommodates working toward something else, all the while contributing something very real to your community. If you love it and you just want to go down that path it opens doors to becoming a firefighter/paramedic, Physicians Assistant, or various types of nursing - all high paying flexible jobs that can be taken anywhere whatsoever.

I’d avoid anything that locks you into location or long retraining. Plumbing is honest work, but it’s a decade play and ties you to one place. You need cash flow faster and flexibility. What usually works after a gap is problem driven work, not identity driven work. Pick a narrow, painful problem you already understand, ops, support, logistics, growth, and sell outcomes, not a “startup.” Consulting, done right, is often the fastest bridge back to income while you rebuild signal and network.\n\nYou’re not behind, you’re just between chapters.

          "body": "Andy Frisella has a power list system of doing just 5 things; action items each day. I started doing this in early 2017. My list usually is mostly business but some days there's family and personal items in that five.\n\nI write it down in a note book every night. Then, at the end of each day, I write win or loss. If you win enough days, you win the week. If you win enough weeks, you win the month. \n\nIt also gives me a journal of action items that I can go back and look at over the years. If I don't hit a quarterly goal or if a habit doesn't change in my personal life. I can take a look and see what I did each day in that time period.\n\nAnother aspect of building a business, they're people don't talk about is how easy it is to lie to ourselves. We try to make ourselves believe that busy is productive. Are you really moving the needle though? \n\nIt's the easiest form of discipline building i've ever implemented. Now there have been some dark nights of the soul so to speak throughout the last ten years. Where I don't wanna do anything. In those moments on those days I make myself get up and do something very uncomfortable.\n\nA couple weeks ago, we had a cold front come through Texas. Nothing major but colder than what we're used to. I live in a rural area, surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of acres. I think it said thirty five mile an hour winds that day but our wind gauge was hitting fifty plus. It was miserable outside.\n\nI'd made myself get up at 6:30 in the morning, because I usually sleep until I wake up naturally. I got dressed quickly, and I went out to the horses barn/shed. And got his bucket and I hiked back to the shop to fill it with feed and let it soak with warm water. I made myself stand outside in the cold wind for that ten minutes. Then, I hiked back out through multiple gates that I had to unlock and lock. Disengaging and reengaging electric fences. Gave the beast his bucket. When I hiked back through the gates and went inside. All in all, it took about thirty minutes.And I was cold.\n\nI jumped in a hot shower.Got dressed again for the day. Grabbed my backpack with my business stuff in it and I headed to my office. I didn't feel better but I was moving. I started into my list which I had purposely made very easy for the day. Knocked it out within about two hours. \n\nWhen you're done with your five things, you're done for the day. Myself included everyone always says, oh I can do twelve things or thirty things. Just do the fucking five things. \n\nI finished my five things and I went to sit on the couch in my office and just scroll the internet. Then, my phone rang with a new customer. Then, another, and another, and another, and another. Turns out, one of our competitors was bought out, and the new company's prices went up another thirty percent. I have no employees.I handle everything for my company and it's quite large. When a new customer contacts us, though I have to do all the onboarding, enter their order set up the financials and the emails and then pick their order pack their order and ship their order all before three p m.\n\nI was not in the mood or the mind state.To do this shit. I was done for the day. \n\nNow i've switched into a different phase, which is called test days.... Another Andy Frisella process. This is where your discipline kicks in. I knocked out all the orders on time.And then I went back to the office to tally up the financial. $17,356 in new sales in one day. That was a record.My previous record was $13k. Each one of these customers will re order every single month forever. I had just had the best day. I'd had in business in a long time and it was one of the worst days for me mentally.\n\nIf I had not of woken up early and done the horse feeding  before forcing myself to the office to knock out my powerlist, it would have been too late in the day for me to accomplish all three things. \n\nThat leads me to another belief that I personally have, is that I have a path. I'm on my path and as long as I stay on my path, things will work out.\n\nThose test days are The Times that you look back on for brief encouragement when you need it to reinforce your discipline.\n\nKnow this though, when you become successful, even though you're still dealing with this type of shit, weekly, people are gonna tell you that you must have gotten lucky to be as successful as you are.",

But Action without alignment is just a distraction. \n\nTry  Visualizing having achieved your goal. and feeling those emotions. if you feel like your not fully convinced you will achieve it. set a small goal that you KNOW you can do and visualize having already DONE that. these small actions compound, Maintaining these emotions will create the reality you want ,you will intuitively see the actions you need to take to make it real.

It's not supposed to.\n\nWhat you're experiencing now is normal. It's the middle of the journey, where the excitement wears off and reality sets in. This is where most people quit. Not because they're not disciplined - because they're exhausted.\n\nThe \"just be disciplined\" advice is bullshit. You can't discipline your way out of building from the wrong place.\n\nHere's what helped me:\n\n**Stop asking \"am I motivated today?\"**\n\nStart asking \"why am I building this?\"\n\nIf the answer is external (prove something, hit metrics, look successful), you'll burn out. Because external goals keep moving. There's always another milestone.\n\nIf the answer is internal (this matters to me, this aligns with who I am, this serves something bigger), you'll find a different kind of fuel. Not motivation - purpose.\n\n**The mental side you mentioned?**\n\nThat doubt, that comparison, that \"am I wasting my time\" spiral - it's all coming from one place: you're building from pressure, not purpose.\n\nPressure to perform. Pressure to succeed. Pressure to prove you're not wasting your time.\n\nWhen you build from pressure, every low day feels like failure. Every slow week feels like proof you're not good enough.\n\nWhen you build from purpose, low days are just... days. Not evidence. Not identity.\n\n**Practically, what I did:**\n\n\\- Stopped checking metrics first thing (they controlled my mood)\n\n\\- Got clear on why THIS project, not just \"be successful\n\n\\- Set boundaries (work hours, offline time, non-negotiables\n\n\\- Found someone who'd been where I am, and five years ahead of me (coach, not just cheerleader)\n\nThe discipline people talk about? It's easier when you're building something that matters to you, not something you \"should\" be building.\n\nYou're not stuck because you lack motivation. You might be stuck because you haven't figured out if this is YOUR thing or someone else's idea of success. It's a lonely journey and sometimes you might lack the accountability, guidance, structure that you might have had before. That's ok to have.\n\nNot quitting is good. But also - ask yourself, am I building the right thing? Or am I just stubborn?\n\nThose are different questions.\n\nI also echo u/FatherOften on the 5 priority list items that no matter what, you action on.\n\nGood luck.

Think of it like an **LLM**: if you don’t provide clear **constraints**, the output is just high-speed hallucinations and chaos. That’s exactly what we do to our brains.\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\n* **Strategy vs. Busywork:** Being submerged in tasks isn’t 'grinding'; it’s a one-way ticket to Burnout City. If your strategy doesn’t dictate a lean action plan, you’re just throwing spaghetti at the wall and wondering why the wall is messy.\n* **The 'Void' Factor:** For a first-timer, entrepreneurship is a literal leap into the void. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed. Give yourself actual time to **somatize** the shift. A total identity overhaul takes much longer than we’re willing to admit, and you can't rush the biological clock of adaptation.\n* **Neuroplasticity is your gym:** The 'mental side' isn't just something to 'endure.' You’re using neuroplasticity to hardwire the habits of the person you want to become. This takes time, repetition, and a lot of recalibration.\n\n**TL;DR:** Stop adding tasks and start add better constraints. Above all, be supportive to yourself, you deserve it, even if only for the massive step you took by starting this journey on the first place.\n\nHope this helps and good luck!",

You kept pushing even when everyone doubted you, and you failed even harder. Failure is a good thing in the business of startups because it means you tried.

I asked him what he’d actually do if he had to start again today. No audience, no brand, no clients. What surprised me wasn’t anything flashy, but how slow and manual the first phase really was.\n\n1) He focused on one free channel He tried a lot over time, but early on it was mostly consistent posting aimed at a very specific buyer. Nothing viral. Just showing up.\n\n2) He kept his online presence extremely simple One page that made it clear who it was for and what problem it solved. No fancy site.\n\n3) Early outreach was very manual He spent a lot of time personally replying to people who engaged but didn’t reach out. No automation.\n\n4) He didn’t judge results quickly He mentioned that most of the benefits only showed up after sticking with it longer than felt comfortable.\n\nI’m curious if others here have seen similar patterns, or if this breaks down at some point.",

Scale and automation only helps once you have a manual workflow that is nailed down really well.\n\nIf you are getting started, assuming you have a product that actually solved a problem, first identify your ideal customer persona! Who are the exact set of users who badly need your solution right now!\n\nOnce you have the ideal customer persona, list down all the marketing channels you can use to find them- wherever they hang out- be it reddit, manual out reach on linkedin or even meta/google ads! once you have this list, your goal is to run time boxed and budget constrained rapid experiments in parallel to find out out which marketing channel works best for you at this stage. Ideally you will find one that outperforms rest! Once you have this channel you can essentially scale up till it breaks. Once it breaks, you kinda have to repeat the process all over again. But that doesn't usually happen until you cross $1M in revenue etc!\n\nHope this helps :)",

I needed high enrollment to pay myself so I had to figure out a way to get more parents in the door. I tried a bunch of different things but what I landed on that had the biggest impact was making my business the happiest workplace it could possibly be for my employees. I learned to be kind but firm, both with parents who were being unrealistic or difficult and also with my employees. They learned that I wouldn't allow them to be mistreated. I created amazing benefits, including higher pay, bonuses for hitting benchmarks, and more time off. I insisted on a positive culture and got teachers behind it so that it started to grow organically. By creating a workplace that my staff had never experienced before, they worked harder. They understood that to get the kind of benefits and environment that I had created meant that they also had to follow my rules such as always smile at parents when they dropped off or picked up, going the extra mile for a child or a parent, extra training, do the right thing, be nice to your coworkers, come on time, etc. Once I had all that in place, the parents naturally noticed the difference. My team was friendly and happier than anything they saw in the preschool industry. They noticed that their children loved coming to school and were truly cared for. They told their friends about it. People started driving long distances just to enroll with us. I was able to open a second school and fill that up fairly quickly because of my practices. In the child care industry, just getting 85% enrollment is really good. Before I sold my business, I consistently was at 95%+. People didn't want to unenroll during the summer months because they didn't want to lose their place. I had staff who was with me for 5, 10, 15 years. I am very proud of what I accomplished. By treating my team like gold and holding them to a higher standard, the sales took care of themselves.",

But from what I'm seeing, you're not the type to become an entrepreneur out of necessity. So you should keep an eye out for opportunities. It's likely that your choice will be in technology. Entrepreneurship is wonderful, but you have to follow a path full of strategies. And that's quite complicated, haha, because you don't always win. And when I say win, I'm not talking about competitors, because over time you realize that your competitors are actually your partners, haha. It's crazy. Because there are days when you'll only have \"water\" to survive and there are days when you'll have a \"banquet.\" The entrepreneur is always in the worst situation, because the objective is first and foremost their organization.\n\n\nNote: I am an entrepreneur in the technology sector and also a PhD in entrepreneurship. And do you know what the secret is? You must persevere. Change your product, but don't give up. However, if I were to tell you what I intend to specialize in from now on, it would be in manufacturing products and the financial market. Oh, and choose a partner who is resilient to loss. That's important. They also need to be strong enough to handle your yelling. Yes. A fragile partner won't do.

It only counts as true failure if you stop trying. \n\nWhat I have learned throughout the past few years is that life is a lot about learning. Take notes. Compare what it is that failed in each step or project. If you can redo those steps would it be in the same order? To give you an example. I tried opening up a business with “partners” people who I didn’t know all that well and that was my first mistake. Now I know who I want to do business with (type of person) doesn’t matter if as a partner or associate. Second mistake was to focus on equipment rather than the facility. Point is with notes you know not to repeat these mistakes. \n\nAlso, believe in yourself as much as he believes in you. He knows what you’re capable of. Your success will be his reward.",

My situation was slightly different as she was there but would shoot down my efforts and not support but she was physically there and I loved her so wanted her to enjoy the fruits of the labour (she actually wrote a Reddit piece about how I was delusional so it struck a nerve when she found out that we had an office). Saying all of that I do recognise and appreciate that work did take precedence during the relationship and at times often did and I can relate to you on that front \n\nI’m integrating the understanding that the people who did truly support are still here and a friend made sense to me that “if she was truly supporting you she would have been a part of what you are doing not just being there ‘waiting’” for something to happen. \n\nWith your situation, you clearly show respect and appreciation for what your ex did with you and you needed to put that time in on your craft to get to where you were. Although you may not be able to enjoy the fruits with him, you owe it to yourself for the hard work you put in and the dreams and ambitions were yours.

When you get to a certain number of employees, you should obtain an HR consultant (e.g. they know legal requirements at various # of employees).  \n\nBookkeeping is an extremely high return activity to outsource, since it is something that needs to be done, yet the owner either has to spend too much time away from clients/prospects learning how to do it and also to do it, or it is not done timely or accurately.  Few business owners realize also that bookkeeping provides more than just the accounting, it provides good timely information to better manage your business.

This is a pretty common positive side for almost everyone. But no has really talked about the negative and dark side of the journey. Let me start with mine. I started working at different startups to learn more about the industry and ecosystem. After a good years of experience, I started working on my own startup. It’s been two years, I’ve gone through depression, anxiety, not having enough runway, running out of money, almost becoming homeless, suicidal thoughts, no personal life, investor rejections, tons of refining my idea, solution based on problem space. Even at the initial stage, my customers insulted me and told me to shut down the project because it was a waste of time, money and resources. Later, I did self validations, improved myself, my idea, solution and learned more about my customers.\n\nPlease share your dark experience of being as a founder.",

Living in that middle ground is uncomfortable.

Everyone tells you to work hard and that you have to grind because your competitors are grinding harder than you, but nobody ever talks about the importance of balance and not feeling guilty for not working hard all the time. I hope if any new founders are reading this, that you make it a focus to take care of yourself first and foremost, and never lose sight of what makes you happy, or your hobbies. The grind is not worth it, at least in my eyes. There are better ways to achieve your goals through a slow, methodical, and well thought out plan of attack.

          "body": "My 2nd start up spawned off running a brick and mortar business I bought during covid, part of my plan to diversify my income. I underestimated the amount of work I’d have to put into this business, and as covid hit I thought to retire my parents so I took all fiscal responsibility at home. The stress impacted my relationships, broke up with my gf at the time, business was not picking up as anticipated so I thought of a way to scale my business with minimal turn around/money by creating a Airbnb like platform for my niche. \n\nIt worked I was increasing my top and bottom line and was in talks to getting other businesses onboard the platform with all the tools to facilitate the same scaling capability. I figured there’s a market and tried raising funds for it to scale the platform as I knew there was a decent demand from my research.\n\nBut I was delaying the inevitable, and macroeconomic conditions overpowered me. I got wiped out. Went deep into debt trying to make everything work, so I had to sell my home, businesses and was literally left with nothing. \n\nOn top of that you see true colours of the people (friends and family included) around you and realize there was no one of substance and it was all people that seemed like they were happy to see the carnage unfold.\n\nYeah I took a major risk on myself and I’m proud of that, it was a Hail Mary but it didn’t connect.\n\nI was borderline homeless and even went 3-4 days at a time not eating because I had no money. Now I’m slowly but surely getting back on my feet now (ironically fractured my ankle on New Year’s Day 2026 lol). I’ve been working on my new startup for the past year, have a few pilots and working my way to success. I’m not new to bootstrapping to traction, initially it may have seemed daunting now feels like a walk in the park. The results won’t show overnight but I’m used to it. \n\nNo risk no glory, never give up, the pain is striking but the journey is priceless. You’ll just learn to bear the pain seamlessly, making the journey more tolerable. Also sometimes I think what’s meant to be is literally just that, I felt like I was sent through the wringer to learn as much as I can and have a clean slate wiped clean of all the toxicity around me.",

          "body": "Partnership offers can be amazing or a slow-motion headache, so I’d treat this like a deal negotiation, not a “vibes” decision.  \n  \nA few things I’d want _in writing_ before you say yes:  \n\\- What exactly is being partnered? Equity in the whole company vs just a route/book of clients.  \n\\- How profits are calculated (gross vs net, what expenses come off the top, owner salary).  \n\\- Decision rights (pricing, hiring, equipment purchases).  \n\\- What happens if one of you wants out (buyout formula, non-compete, client ownership).  \n  \nAlso: measure your real contribution. If you’re the one doing the work + retaining customers, you have leverage.  \n  \nTactical tip: build your own “operations dashboard” so you’re not negotiating blind. I’ve seen people use Manus (AI no-code web builder) to set up a simple full-stack internal tool: a database of clients, job history, and margins, with authentication so only you/your boss can access it. You can even add Stripe integration for deposits or recurring plans if you ever spin off. Having clean numbers (not just “I hustle hard”) changes partnership talks.  \n  \nNot legal advice, but if the offer is real, a fair contract + transparent bookkeeping protects both sides and keeps the hustle from turning into resentment.",

You can certainly buy a small and stable business, but that’s expensive, and you are already locked in to what it is. Both have their places.\n\n3. It’s not a deal breaker, but having industry experience already lets you get started faster and less learning curve. \n\n4. Going too big too fast, having big dreams and ideas.

Just pick any business that already exists, and do it slightly better,  show up on time,  offer good service,  be consistent.   That's really all it takes to run a good business.   You don't need to re-invent the wheel.  Think garbage removal,  window cleaning, roofing company, landscaping, moving company etc.\n\nDon't buy an existing business or take on a huge loan.  You find something that you can start out small at.  Ideally something you don't need to to to school for like learning a trade (pumber, electrician).  Let's say garbage removal.   You start by working a traditional job,  getting your expenses really lean and saving up enough money to buy a big, cheap pickup truck.   You register a business, make a website, learn everything you can online from YouTube,  reddit,  books from the library about garbage removal and starting a small business.   You start social media accounts, hire a friend or someone on fiver to make you a logo.   You post ads on kijiji, craigslist, Facebook marketplace.   You get your first few jobs and get paid cash.   They leave you a good review.   You find a local business center that offers grants to small businesses and offers free classes and resources for local entrepreneurs.  You get a few more jobs.  You learn about how collecting and paying sales tax works and you get setup with quickbooks.  You design and print up door knockers and leave them on 1000 doors.  You try more sales and marketing things.   You get more work.   Eventually,  you have enough jobs that you can finance a big truck with a bin that you leave in their driveway.  You get bigger invoices.  Eventually you quit your full time job.   You keep working hard and growing.   You get so busy that you need to hire your first employee.  You get a 2nd truck etc etc etc.\n\nI studied business in school but it really doesn't translate to actually starting your own business.   You mostly learn by doing the thing. \n\nI am a self employed real estate photographer and i also run an online community for photographers to learn and grow.   All in,  i earn low 6 figures.  If i wanted to put the effort in,  i could do more sales, hire employees,  and build a small real estate media agency. \n\nYou just gotta start and take it one step at a time.",

          "body": "From psychology the answer would be to have a solid, non negotiable end routine.\n\nWrite down what you have completed in the session and what's to be done next session. Clean your desk/take care of everything that still needs to be taken care off, etc. And when you are truly finished finished, give your body some form of signal. Maybe clapping your hands twice or slapping yourself in the face, whatever you choose do it everytime so that your body connects it to \"work done\".\n\nOnce you did it, truly let the work be. Don't do something little more, don't start planning something for your work, don't try to reaearch something or read a book for your work. Teach your body and mind that once work is done, it truly is done for the day.\n\nSo, the practical conclusion: You want to switch your nervous system from performance to relax mode. If the End routine isn't enough for you, you can hook in here and just try a new thing every week. Maybe medidating and breathing. Maybe taking a hot shower or bath. Maybe you first want to go for a walk, write your thoughts down and then declare the work done for today. However the details you are working out will look like, it's important that you take it seriously.\n\nYou can only spend as much energy as you regenerate. Not wasting energy, but also filling it up to the limit everyday, is the key to consistently work hard without burning out, without going into depression and without losing focus.\n\nOne last tipp, if you can afford it under your circumstances, don't ever use an alarm to wake up. Go to bed when you are tired and stay up once you wake up naturally. Easiest way to ensure your body actually had as much sleep time as it needed.",

          "body": "so you have to have something you are good at doing. It super duper helps if you enjoy doing that thing. Then you need to figure out a way to have you doing that thing make money.\n\nThe easiest way to imagine this is to make a product and sell it. For example, let's say you like making muffins. You can make muffins and sell them to people who like to eat muffins. To figure out the route from making muffins to to making money on muffins, you can use various marketing frameworks to give you a starting route. My favorite is the 5 Ps of Marketing first developed by E. Jerome McCarthy in the 1960s. Originally he had 4Ps but I like the model where there are 5. \n\n1. Product: We know it is muffins. Now... what kind of muffins? What are your favorites? What are your friends favorites? What are easiest to make? What are hardest to make. As we get into the other Ps of Marketing, this answer might change. Also, what do you call the name of the company and what do you call the muffins? \n\n2. Place: This is really important for a muffin start up because it is a two part question: where are we selling the muffins and where are we making the muffins. If you go with a bakery model where the place you bake and sell are the same place, then cool. But if we don't have the money to pay for commercial rent then we need to think about other solutions. Many states have cottage kitchen laws that allow people to make commercial foods in their own home as long as a state regulator comes to their home and inspects the kitchen to ensure everything is commercial grade and up to state standards. Then you need to figure out where to sell them separately. This might be a weekend farmers market type deal where you sell on weekends. But selling at these farmer markets will incur material costs (we need a tent, tables, signs, cases to display muffins, bags, boxes, a point of sale system, etc.) and fees (pay for a spot in the market).\n\n3. Price: How much do we charge per muffin? How much do ingredients cost? If we buy ingredients in bulk; we can make more muffins cheaper but we have to make a lot of muffins. How many muffins per hour can we make?  If we are doing the farmers market, then we have to take into consideration all of the costs of manning a booth for a weekend and consider how many muffins we need to sell to cover those costs and ingredient costs and have a little left over for ourselves. \n\n4. People: Two parts to this question. Who is making and selling the muffins and who is buying the muffins. If you are hypothetically the muffin maker in question, great. But if you need help setting up and running the booth at the farmers market, you need to take into account how much their time is worth. This is also the time to think about your customers. If I were advising your business, I would take a field trip to the farmers market and check out the crowd. Are there a lot of people or are there not that many people. Do people skew younger or older? Are people buying lots of stuff or not a lot of stuff? Are they buying lots of baked goods or not a lot of baked goods?\n\n5. Promotion: This is the part I leave last because I think there is not a lot of point to executing on this part if the other parts above aren't figured out. But now that you know how much you should sell each muffin for, maybe you can do a special sampler muffin tray to let people try one of each of your muffins. You can hand out coupons for the next week so they can get 20% off a muffin order of 6 or more muffins if they come back. You can ask people at your booth to tag you on social media for a 10% discount on a muffin order. If sales are doing well you can allocate some of your revenue to advertisements and do a targeted tiktok ad in your 30 mile area to let people know that you sell muffins at the farmers market. If you make friends with another vendor, you can talk about splitting the costs of your tiktok ad budget and make one video advertising both you and the other vendor. It helps if you are neighboring stalls. \n\nThis is a lot of thinking for a \"simple\" business like selling muffins. That is because it is hard. People on YouTube who make videos detailing out how \"simple\" it might be are glazing over nuances that actually make the business engine go. Like I said earlier, as you make adjustments to one part of the marketing mix, other parts of the marketing mix will be adjusted. You have to keep doing these adjustments until it comes to an equilibrium. Then you can extract these findings and turn them into a plan. \n\nThe difference between a plan and a marketing mix outline like what was ideated above is an order of which thing you need to do first to get going down the path toward creating a sustainable business. \n\nIf there are specific questions you have based around a product/service you are investigating you should probably post about that and we can be of more help.",

I think it might have been produced by some government economic development committee.  Anyway, almost 15 years later I'm in my 3rd year of a business degree and I attended a seminar about entrepreneurship and they showed us the exact same video! \n\nI can boil it down for you. \nThere are three ways to get money to start your business. Number one save up. Number two borrow money from family/investors. Number three borrow money from the bank. \nThere are three types of businesses. Sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations. \nI feel like that video was equally valuable to me in the fourth grade as I was to me in university\n\n\nIt is shocking how closely your example of buying candy in bulk and selling it on the train illustrates how to start a business. It will blow your mind to find out that almost everyone at all ages is making it up as they go along. For example if you wanted to start a candy store instead of selling it on the train, you rent a space, set up utilities, buy the candy and start selling it in the store. It's almost exactly the same except you are paying rent for a store. \n\nI mean depending where you live there might be licenses and permits that you have to buy. But you do sort of make it up as you go along.\n\nFormalizing the way you do business by writing procedures and policies down, will allow you to grow your business by hiring staff. It will allow you to move from being the salesman on the train to being the guy that organizes the salesmen.",

This particular idea was launched on January 1, 2021 and has resulted in just under $100k in revenue in 2025. You have to be able to articulate an idea into a written plan that defines the objectives of the business. Once you have a clear picture of how the business will make money it becomes necessary to define every process within your business that will result in you meeting your objectives of the business. So far I have two businesses running successfully. I stopped working for other people in 2018 and never looked back. \n\nOne of the most important things that I learned was that the business needs time to develop and mature. You must have a way to earn money while you allow the necessary time to develop, grow, and nurture your business. Most people will spend years and years punching a clock to help someone else realize their dreams, but then when they start a business and build a dream they give up in a year or two because the business has not gotten the proper traction that it needs. Plus there are a whole bunch of people in my life that did not support me having a business during the stages where it wasn't making money and I could not sustain living expenses. The thing is that I had to tell all the clock punchers to fuck off and stop projecting their working class views on me. I mean shit, they are not gonna give me the money or resources I need to live anyway so why the fuck would I listen to them? Punch that clock for 40 years and leave me alone. I got plans. \n\nMy second business that I started in 2024 just crossed $15k in sales in 2025. It is passive income for me versus my other company which provides a service that I am present for in order to make the money. The passive company will continue to grow over time and earn me a nice passive income while I play, work, sleep, and just live. If the sales continue to increase and the overhead remains low, this company will surpass my other one and earn me a nice living.\n\nGo for it. You have nothing to lose.",

It just requires you to notice a problem. Understand the opportunity within the problem and understand how the market speaks and addresses that problem and then just emulate them.\nThen, it then narrows down to building a system for the business you want to start.

Most platforms have export functions buried in settings. Set a calendar reminder monthly.\n\nDon't put all eggs in one basket. Even if 90% of sales come from one platform, having a basic presence elsewhere (your own site, a secondary marketplace) means you're not starting from zero if this happens again.\n\nDocument your account history obsessively. Screenshots of good standing, payment records, compliance with their TOS. When you do get a human on the phone, having receipts helps.\n\nThe \"suspicious activity\" flag is often triggered by stuff like logging in from a new location, sudden sales spikes, or even their own system glitches. Usually resolves but the lack of communication is brutal.\n\nHope you get it sorted quickly.",

This is not child support related but rather a debt owed to a bank for about $3,500.00.  The papers were served by a law firm and have been filed with our local court.  These read very differently from the regular child-support garnishments I am used to.  This garnishment letter states that my failure to execute all documents and as well as begin garnishing wages in a timely manner could result in the full debt obligation being charged to us (our company).  \n\nI am directed to fill out the paperwork enclosed, expedite return to the law firm and file a copy with our local clerk of court within 20 days of receipt.\n\nAnd the fee I can charge for all the work - $17.  State of Florida allows a $5 admin fee for the first payroll garnishment and $2 each payroll after.  I have to pay for the expedited return shipping of docs to the law firm.  I have to pay for the filing fee with the clerk of court.  And $17 does not begin to cover the amount of administrative time that will be applied to this endeavor.\n\nIt absolutely BOGGLES my mind that I am expected to bear the costs for this person's inability to pay their bills or handle their personal finances.  Not only that but if I fail to respond/take action quickly, I could be responsible for HIS debt!!!  \n\nI am upset and outraged.  I have enough expenses and worries being a small business owner.

I worked there through the housing market collapse of 2008. I saw first hand how predatory banks would get. Charging people $35 overdraft fees per transaction regardless of the amount of the transaction. There was a cap of five overdraft fees a day before the collapse. They raised it to ten overdraft fees max per day during the crisis. So I had to justify these fees to customers by saying ‘well we paid for the item’ or ‘you didn’t manage your account and so it cost us money to receive and reverse this charge so here’s a fee for each’. All while many people just had less than a hundred dollars of charges that brought them negative - then getting $350 of fees per day, plus fees for the account staying negative. \nAll it takes is a mortgage payment, a hospital bill that was paid, to get so negative, then a mountain of fees for the ‘burden’ of having this negative account on the books and you’re done. Maybe you don’t pay it as a protest or whatever. But then they’ve got the money and resources on their side to pursue - as they’re doing now. It’s not child support. They got got by a for profit institution. \n\nNo matter how this person got here.

In practice, if you fill out the form correctly, submit it on time, and follow the process, you don't end up being responsible for the debt. The system is designed to force you to cooperate, not to transfer the obligation to you… even if the wording is awful.\n\nI completely agree that the administrative fee is absurd and doesn't reflect the actual time or costs (especially postage and filing). Unfortunately, the state views it as a \"civic duty\" of the employer, not as a service you provide voluntarily.\n\n\nIf you don't already, it's usually worthwhile to have a standard internal procedure (checklist + templates) for these situations. This reduces the administrative burden and stress when they arise. It shouldn't be necessary, but it helps protect you.\n\n\nIn short: your frustration is valid; the system is clumsy with small businesses.

          "body": "I'm so sorry this happened to you. It feels devastating, doesn't it?\n\nBut here's the thing. She can only copy you. The smart entrepreneurs (YOU!) \\*create\\* - everyone else copies. When you have time, come up with unique recipes. Also, don't call the cakes by the same name you saw in the book or video you learned it from: \"brand\" it by calling it something unique. So maybe a ginger carrot cake becomes a SpiritedAd Sugar 'n' Spice cake (add a tiny grating of nutmeg for a hint of a flavour) - unless she's got a good palate, she won't be able to reverse engineer that and make knock offs.\n\nBut really, in a way, you should thank her. You proved that a market exists for the mini cakes. She ran with the idea and proved you were selling too cheap, that the students would happily pay more for the exact same thing. So next time, price it at HER price. DON'T think going cheaper is the solution. MATCH her. \n\nThat way, she's got to either keep upping her prices to keep feeling superior (she isn't - you guy have a captive audience in school, is all), or she's got to come up with her own ideas.\n\nAlso, here's the reality: you baked the mini cakes because YOU had an idea. Guess what - that makes \\*you\\* the entrepreneur, not her. She's simply a copycat. \n\nIf you enjoy baking, keep doing it. You'll get better the more you practice. And baking, once you understand the basics, is SUPER versatile. You can come up with SO many ideas, she'll always be following, not leading.\n\nOther things you can offer: cookies, protein bars (these can get expensive, so watch out), brownies (with things like sweetened shredded coconut in them for texture, or made with condensed milk for an extra \"undefinable something\"), macarons, those rolled no-bake sweets, and more. Even mini-cakes with chopped up candy bars inside can be a differentiator - again, with your own branding, she won't know what you made!\n\nThe bottom line is, you're the trail-blazer. Keep up with your grades for now, and keep experimenting with baking (and with cooking!). Keep selling to your schoolmates - ignore what she's doing, because there's room for both of you. Instead of looking at her as competition, just note what prices she's offering her goodies at and go equal. NEVER compete on price.\n\nBy the time you graduate high school, you'll have proven to yourself that you have the chops to be a successful business. Focus on things like understanding your margins (how much it costs to make the goods compared to the total you get from selling a batch - that profit margin is what helps you do things like pay taxes, insurance, building rent, etc. as an adult with a business. (If your family has a Costco membership, go with your parents the next time they head to Costco, and check out what fun ingredients you can put in your goodies.) Take business courses if they're offered at school, otherwise, definitely look into YouTube videos - there's SO much you can do even as a high schooler. \n\nRight now, for example, you can literally use AI to start a small business online and get super successful and she won't even know about it. Go to ChatGPT, tell it what your strengths are, and ask it for suggestions for businesses you can start with no cash, no fancy equipment. There are kids making money even just creating social media videos for businesses: a real human showing off how they use the companies products is WAY more appealing than a formal ad. If you do this, look up videos about making UGC for Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.\n\nSorry this is so long - your post just struck a chord. I remember being a teen and wanting SO much to do something big. You've got great instincts. Trust them, keep going. You're going to be a superstar one day!\n\nMy DMs are open if you get stuck and just want someone to bounce ideas off of!",

It's sometimes quite simple really, little things like just adding a little more water to the mix so the bubbles are bigger, or using lard instead of butter can make a huge difference, even using a different sugar like powdered instead of regular, or mixing two different ones like brown sugar with powdered. \n\nYou get the idea, and I'm sure with a little research and experimentation, you can leave your competitor in the dust. Now, go to one of the Baking subs and ask questions and do not tell a soul what you are up to because you know how gossip works.

This is how you will truly tell how good of a friend she is. \n\nGood luck on both sides of this!",

      "selftext": "So my mom started a consignment store in her 20s about 35 years ago. Over those past 35 years we have grown more than we ever thought possible and accumulated over 20,000 consigners. We have been doing great and actually had are best year ever this year. We also boast a 4.8 on google reviews so I’m pretty proud of what my mom has built. Recently a women made a post on a local facebook group with about 26,000 members slamming our store, saying we are rude, didn’t take her clothes, etc. While we do love constructive criticism this post was full of lies and complaints that are all adressed in the contract are make every consigner sign before bringing anything in. The post blew up with tons of angry people complaining about how we were to picky and didn’t take there clothes. If anyone has been in the consignment business you would know how picky you have to be bc space is limited and extremely valuable. Anyways she denied signing any contract in her post which was completely false as we physically have a copy of her contract with the signature dating all the way back to 2014. On top of this she used credit on account multiple times meaning she knew she had an account in order to use the money in it. My question is how to handle the situation. Publicly out the woman with evidence of the lying or let it brush over. ",

          "body": "I’ve run my own ebay consignment business for almost 15 years. When I first started, I took whatever people wanted to sell. Self help books, old computers, shoes. I once took a used mattress on consignment that turned out to have a big stain on it after I unwrapped it for a buyer (he still decided to buy it, although I significantly discounted it for him at that point 🤢)\n\nOver the years, I grew more selective as a business because I had to. Most people could care less if you waste your own time and money trying to sell stuff that they just want to recoup some money from, but it obviously matters to you a lot more than them. I explain to people that don’t understand why I won’t take everything that I make the same amount of money selling ten $10 items as I do a single $100 item (and one requires 10x the amount of effort, literally). \n\nI’d assume this is the same way with selling clothes. You know your market best and can only fit so much in your store, so you have to pick items that your buyers are willing to purchase from your consignors, as you really have two different customers as a consignment business. \n\nAnyhow, I hope this may help you / others understand why good consignment businesses are so selective. It really comes down to supply (of things that people want to sell… which is overwhelming at times) vs demand (of things that people are willing to buy secondhand for good prices, which constantly changes). \n\nGood luck OP!",

          "body": "Not to scare you but despite how good of an idea that it may sound like, I think it’s unlikely that addressing the general public will work. If this lady has already demonstrated an oddly targeted vendetta toward your mother’s store, I’m not sure a “politically / delicately correcting the record” post will quash things. \n\n In my opinion, I think this may require a 1-2-punch. By this, I mean that you start with a post that doesn’t engage her head on and is educational in nature as many other comments here describe. Examples have included how the store &amp; its contracts operate but doesnt get into a game of dispute &amp; debate the Karen’s allegations. \n\nPart two is having your finger on the trigger for a corporate litigation attorney. I know it sounds intense but you said it yourself, this person has a following and it’s stirred others to voice other negative opinions too. You mentioned that you have a signed contract from a decade ago, I’m curious if there is any type of dispute resolution clause within it. If it doesn’t have one, you may consider sending a cease and desist directly to her since one may be able to argue that she is guilty of libel. It’s not even puffery, you guys have years of data to know what sale should look like so if there is a hit to revenue, you could try to draw a connection to her for damages. \n\nBefore you do any of this, weigh the options and use your best judgment of the situation to determine if it’s worth going this route. Sometimes, the quickest way to resolving bs like this is by demonstrating you won’t put up with it. This isn’t make-believe Tik Toks, this is your mother’s legacy (that happens to be a cash flowing business) and that needs to be protected. \n\nAlso, look this person up in the public criminal records (city, county, state) and local civil record to see who they rally areas. I’ve sometimes seen that getting into tiffs with local businesses is something that people make a career off… just being a professional complainer. It’s sad but true lol. \n\nIf you have an attorney or have the money to hire one (a nasty letter and some research should likely be a few grand for this situation) then you may want to consider it. \n\nAnother more tactical approach  is to have a one on one conversation with her where you can catch her off guard (and likely not recording the conversation) and just hear her out. I’ve noticed over the years that these people are angry about something in their life and more lonely than anything else. If you’re just someone who hears them out and makes them feel seen, a lot of times they will calm down after they get it all out. \n\nBest of luck.",

I would advise you to keep it brief, but use statements like \"if you aren't able to locate a copy of the contract you signed outlining our policies, we're happy to provide one to you\".",

Spam increases, scam attempts get more targeted, and suddenly you are spending time figuring out who even has your info in the first place.  \nWhat surprised me most is how passive it is. You do not opt into most of it. You just exist online and the data spreads(I'm pretty sure LinkedIn is to blame for most of this stuff).  \nFor people who run businesses or have any kind of public presence, how are you handling this without going completely dark?

Twice a week I open up my general email, sort by sender, and fairly quickly delete thousands of junk emails. My clients and coworkers are automated to sort to appropriate folders. I also have specific email addresses I use when I need to enter my email address somewhere I feel will lead to junk mail.\n\nPhone: set up a virtual phone system and transfer your current office number and cell phone to that system. Get a new cell number that you ONLY give to respectful clients, coworkers and family. Never use it online except for extremely secure places (eg banking and medical.) Use a voice prompt on your virtual phones such as \"you have reached AAA, if you know your party's extension, dial it now. Dial 0 to leave a message, 1 for billing, ...\" Calls can either get routed or they can leave a message. You can also set up specific numbers to ring you directly (or xfer to your cell.)\n\nSet up a temporary SMS phone number anytime you put an ad for employees, etc. That way you can delete it when no longer needed.\n\nIf these ideas would not work for you, consider hiring a service that answers the phone, follows specific scripts for various topics, and forwards only calls you want to take.",

And friends/family usually don’t “get it” beyond generic encouragement.  \n  \nA few things that helped me:  \n  \n\\- **Find one operator friend** you can be brutally honest with. Doesn’t need to be same industry—just someone who understands cash flow anxiety and decision fatigue.  \n\\- **Recurring peer group** (monthly mastermind, local chamber, industry Slack). The consistency matters more than the group size.  \n\\- **Make decisions visible**: I keep a “decision log” so I’m not re-litigating the same worries at 2am.  \n\\- If you have the budget, a **therapist/coach** who has worked with founders is underrated.  \n  \nSmall practical tip: loneliness spikes when you’re stuck in reactive mode. Anything that reduces chaos helps.  \n  \nI actually built a tiny “client portal” with **Manus web builder** so customers can submit requests, I can track them in a **database**, and they get **notifications** when I respond. It’s not about tech for tech’s sake—it just removed a bunch of constant pings and gave me breathing room.  \n  \nYou’re not broken for feeling it. This part is just not talked about enough.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been doing ecommerce for a few years now, mostly behind the scenes, like ops, product sourcing, a bit of marketing, so I always thought, if anyone can run their own small shop, it should be me. Last year I finally decided to stop helping other brands grow and try building something that was actually mine.\n\nI didn’t quit my job or anything dramatic. This started as a side thing. My routine was pretty fixed: finish work around 7, grab takeout, sit on the couch, laptop on my knees by 9. That was my business time. At first it felt kind of exciting, like I was stealing time back from my day.\n\nThe idea itself was simple. Products I already understood, suppliers I’d worked with before, nothing fancy. What surprised me was how emotionally exhausting the small decisions were. Naming the brand took me three nights. Pricing made me second guess my entire career. I’d tweak product descriptions at 1am, wake up the next morning and hate every word. After making all those product related decisions, I kind of stalled for a while. I kept questioning whether I could actually run an online store at all. But I’d already put in a fair amount of time and money, so backing out didn’t really feel like an option. I don’t know much about frontend stuff, and hiring someone would’ve been another expense, so I just figured things out on my own. I learned to use Genstore to build a pretty rough first version of the site and then started doing some basic promotion on social media.\n\nThe real punch came after launch. Friends would say “wow that’s cool” and then no orders. Or one order, followed by three days of silence. I’d refresh analytics more than I’d like to admit. Every small cost suddenly felt loud: packaging, transaction fees, refunds. \n\nWhat I didn’t expect is how lonely it feels. At work, if something flops, it’s a team problem. Here, every mistake feels very personal. If a product doesn’t sell, it’s not the market, it’s my judgment. Some nights I honestly miss just clocking out and not caring.\n\nI’m still running the shop. It’s not huge, it’s not freedom, and it definitely hasn’t replaced my income. But it changed how I see small businesses. From the outside it always looks clean and aesthetic. From the inside it’s a lot of quiet doubt, tiny wins, and arguing with yourself at midnight.\n\nSo how others here deal with that mental side. Not the logistics or tactics, but the constant second guessing. Does that ever go away, or do you just get better at living with it?",

I don't like to waste others and my time and beat around the bush when it comes to doing business. My contract may be a tad lengthy, but I disclose EVERYTHING. Base rent, rent increase, lease duration, cam charges and percentages, signage and monument regulation, late payment, lease breaking, useage of the building, parking lot, inside and outside maintenance, plumbing, and even hvac.\n\nMost of the contract is non-negotiable. The only things I really negotiate on is length of the lease and options for lease extensions. I also add an updated exclusivity clause for the new tenant so they don't need to worry about me renting out to a similar business.\n\nSo my contract is pretty pretty binding and breaking lease triggers a payment of the remaining months of the lease, but I feel like our pricing per square foot is VERY fair and since everyone knows what they are getting into up front, people are always interested.\n\nAlso, I've only had 2 tenants move out. The first because the people hired by the tenant just weren't pulling their weight and the tenant wanted to be an absentee owner (of a new business 🙄) and the second because they fulfilled their 3 year lease and did well and wanted to move to a larger location (who I was super happy for). The one who is my current longest tenant currently has a 10 year lease with 2x 5 year options. 😁👍",

I don’t hate marketing, I hate the _constant treadmill_ of “be interesting on demand.” What helped me was reframing it as ops:  \n  \n\\- **Batch one day/month**: film 10 short clips, take 30 photos, write 10 captions. Schedule everything.  \n\\- **One format, one platform**: pick the easiest thing you can repeat (before/after, FAQ, quick tip). Consistency beats novelty.  \n\\- **Reuse**: one longer piece becomes 5 shorts + 3 posts + a newsletter snippet.  \n\\- **Lower the bar**: “good enough” content that answers customer questions often outperforms polished vibes.  \n  \nAlso: if you’re relying on social for leads, it feels extra punishing because your work disappears in 24 hours.  \n  \nA workaround is to push people to something you own. I used **Manus web builder** to set up a simple site with **lead collection/management** (quote requests), an FAQ, and an **AI chatbot** that answers common questions when I’m offline.

Been researching simpler options found some platforms like Vivid Money that apparently do invoicing and banking together so payments would auto match since they're in same system but don't know if that actually works or just marketing speak.\n\nDoes anyone use tools that automatically match payments to invoices or am I missing something obvious here?

Invoice matching is one of those tasks that feels “simple” until you’ve lost a Saturday and realize your brain is now spreadsheet mush.  \n  \nA few ways to reduce the pain:  \n  \n\\- If you use QuickBooks/Xero/etc, check whether your bank feed rules can auto-match by vendor + amount + date window.  \n\\- Standardize vendor references: require invoice # in the bank transfer memo (or use virtual cards per vendor).  \n\\- Move vendors to **ACH + auto-pay** where possible; fewer manual exceptions.  \n\\- For the stubborn cases, set up a lightweight intake: every invoice gets uploaded into one place the moment it arrives.  \n  \nIf you’re even a little technical (or willing to prototype), building a tiny internal tool can help. I’ve seen people use **Manus web builder** to create a private “invoice inbox” app with **authentication**, a **built-in database** for invoice metadata (vendor, due date, amount), and **notifications** for “unmatched after 7 days.” It won’t magically connect to your bank by itself, but because Manus supports **code export**, you can later wire in Plaid/CSV imports or whatever your bank supports.  \n  \nThe goal isn’t perfect automation—just turning 47 manual matches into 5 exceptions you actually have to think about.",

      "selftext": "I’m 28 and I’ve been working for about a year and a half as the only assistant for the owner of a small but high revenue entertainment and business management company. It’s just me and her. No HR, no backup, no real systems. On paper it looks like a solid job. I make around 72k a year, I have autonomy, and I’m exposed to finance, payroll, taxes, and high profile clients. In reality, I am completely burnt out and wake up most mornings with a pit in my stomach.\n\nI handle almost everything. Paying company and client bills, payroll, reconciling endless bank and credit card accounts, handling physical mail and deposits, dealing with IRS and state notices, and putting out constant fires that pop up with no warning. Over time the workload has increased a lot. We onboarded new major clients, migrated banks, and are still using outdated systems that do not scale. None of that came with more support or clearer processes. The expectation is always to just figure it out. When something goes wrong, it turns into a personal issue instead of a systems issue.\n\nRecently I tried to have an honest conversation with the owner about getting help, improving processes, and talking about the future. She had previously told me that one day I could take over or buy the business, so I asked what that would even look like. She told me she has no succession plan, no long term plan, and no intention of changing how she runs things. The conversation quickly turned defensive and blame focused. It became very clear that we have completely different ways of thinking and working. I left that meeting realizing I have lost respect for her leadership and I do not see a future here.\n\nFor context, I am not afraid of hard work. I graduated college in 2020 with a bachelor’s degree in business administration. Before this job, I worked in high end real estate sales at a brokerage that even had a Netflix show, but I left because the culture and status games were extremely toxic. Before that, I worked restaurant jobs, grocery stores, manual labor, home inspections, and even admissions at a major health system. I stayed at every job for over a year and I have always shown up and done what was asked of me. I am proud that I have been able to handle this level of responsibility at my age, but I am realizing that responsibility without support is not growth. It is just burnout.\n\nRight now I feel stuck. I know I cannot do this long term. It is affecting my mental and physical health. At the same time, I am scared to quit without another job lined up. This role is so custom built that even a standard two week notice feels unrealistic. My current plan is to stay professional, emotionally detach, do what is required, and quietly start applying elsewhere while I am still employed.\n\nI am looking for outside perspective. Is it reasonable to job search while mentally checked out like this? How do I frame this role to future employers without trashing my current boss? Are these red flags that mean I should leave sooner rather than later? And has anyone else been in a small business role where everything falls on one person, and how did you get out?",

EVERYONE is replaceable-people I thought I could never live without I did. I sold the business and it continues on without me and I was hands on every single day, selling, warehouse, scheduling, books, taxes etc. The pace and hours of small business is just absolutely insane and no amount of money will compensate you for what you lose-family ties, friends, health, etc. My suggestion is if you LOVE this line of work get a SBA loan and open your own business because you and your boss will never see eye to eye and your health will detiroate. If you do not LOVE it then I’d say punch a clock somewhere else. No job is worth your mental and physical health",

While these methods can work, they often require a lot of manual effort. That’s where [WebIeadr](https://webleadr.pages.dev) comes in. A platform where web designers, developers, SEO specialists, and similar professionals can easily find and contact web design leads such as businesses without websites, in just a couple of clicks, along with many other features (check the website to explore all of them)!\n\nWebIeadr offers a one-time, credit-based system: **$12 for 100 business leads**. No subscriptions or recurring fees: pay only when needed. Credits stay in your account and can be used anytime, with options to buy more as needed. For example, if 40 out of 100 leads lack websites and 15 use third-party services (e.g., Facebook), and you secure just a mere 3 clients with basic sales skills, you could earn around $2,000. Your cost? Just $12\n\nThe bottom line is that WebIeadr offers an extremely quick and efficient solution to find web design leads in just a few clicks and **call them in just one click of a button**. From there, all you need to do is apply your sales skills to convince them that having a website is a worthwhile investment for their business.\n\nKnow a web designer, developer, or SEO specialist who could benefit from this?

Here's how it works:\n\n* You send me your top 3-5 vendor contracts/invoices OR we have a quick 15-min call\n* I analyze them over 2-3 days\n* I show you exactly where you're overpaying (usually $30K-$100K)\n* I give you specific strategies to capture those savings\n\n**No cost. No pitch. No obligation.**\n\n**Why free?** I need case studies and testimonials to build my practice. If I find real savings and you want help capturing them, we can discuss working together at that point. But the audit itself is completely free.\n\n**Best fit for:**\n\n* 50-300 employee companies\n* Significant vendor spend (software, services, IT, supplies)\n* No dedicated procurement person\n* Want to reduce costs but don't know where to start\n\n**What you get:**\n\n* Report showing specific savings opportunities\n* Dollar amounts for each vendor\n* 15-min call to walk through findings\n\nI've led vendor consolidation projects that saved $340K+ annually and managed 50+ vendor relationships. I know how to find money on the table.\n\n**DM me if interested!** I'm limiting this to 10 companies so I can give proper attention to each one.\n\nHappy to answer any questions below.",

There’s also a response verification mode if you want a human-in-the-loop rollout first (imo that’s the only sane way to launch AI in support).​\n\nIf you want to try it, we’re offering the first month free right now—details are on [bettercx.ai](http://bettercx.ai), or just DM and I’ll point you to the right setup for your use case.",

And there's some graphic design and signage lessons you might need to watch.\n\nReal quickly I can list out a few.  Way - way back in the day I used to do mailers. I was the lead graphic designer.\n\n* Don't say shit that you don't do on the job. \"We won't break your windows.\"\n\n* Don't claim things that should be obvious to your trade.  \"We are clean and use sterol equipment at our dentist office.\"\n\n* The main thing you need to get out there is \"who\" you are, \"what\" you can offer, and \"how\" they can get in touch.  Optionally, \"where\" you are located maybe relevant.  So you may want to include that as well. \n\n* Slogans are risky but can be rewarding. Keep it short and make sure it sounds and reads well.  Ask a friend if it's appropriate too.  \n\n* Adding discounts and other incentives should be reserved, strict and limited.  Offering someone 50% off of something calls into question the value of what you're offering.  Instead offer 10 or 15% off for a limited time under a limited condition. \n\n* Don't use fonts and graphics that you can't read.  Do a thumbnail test.  You can shrink down your ad very very small on your screen.  If you can still see what's what, you're good.  \n\n* It's super risky to include photos - cartoons and graphics are okay.  Most of the time a photo feels inappropriate and off-putting with some added liability.  Using pictures of employees is a time bomb, hire actors if needed.  Never include your own face in a photo unless you're a real estate agent. There are exceptions, but do so at your own risk.   A picture of a work vehicle or fleet is one of the exceptions.  People like to see you're a permanent, established business. \n\n\n* Avoid light on white, dark on dark, or any similar color on color text and graphics.  While it may be cool to have your gray logo on a black background.  It's going to look like noise to someone who has half a second to see your ad.  If you do want to do this still, consider adding an outline around your graphic or text.\n\n* Avoid tangents. This is complicated to explain with words.  Essentially, it's when a perceived line touches another perceived line which makes viewers uncomfortable.  For example, the point of a square touching the edge of a page.  Or the edge of the square touching the edge of the page or a border of another graphic. See link. https://share.google/aLoGXHnmUfPyslBeQ\n\n* This one is tough for me. Proofread your work.  Or get an AI to help you with it.  I'm super bad at proofing because I'm dyslexic.  But if you misspell even one word - even when it is intentional, potential customers will look down on you. (This one is really touchy. I've had to call clients, telling them we corrected typos and they would get stupid angry.  If someone points out something odd about your ads, please use your business brain. They are not attacking you, they are bringing up real concerns about making money.)\n\n\nI don't know if this is what you're looking for.  I think you want to know more about the logistics of ad placement and frequency.  But I thought I'd chime in with this little tidbit.",

          "body": "You’ve built a system that lacks a stabilisation phase. The reason you’re tweaking is likely because you don't have clear Conversion KPIs or a mapped out User Flow. When you don't know exactly where the friction is, every bad day feels like a personal failure instead of just a data point to be adjusted.\nIn my experience, restructuring for a shop at your level usually boils down to three things:\n\n1.Are you sending all your traffic to the same landing page? If you segment your entry points (Ads/Social) by audience intent, your conversion reliability goes up, and your stress goes down.\n\n2.Often, it’s not the ad failing; it’s a failure in how the user moves from the ad to the sale. If you isolate exactly where they drop off, you don't have to guess what to fix.\n\n3.You mentioned using AI for monitoring, but are your DMs and Email flows automated? Replacing manual handling with structured flows is the fastest way to lower management cost and mental load.\n\nSo in general even though this might sound harsh, the stress doesn't magically go away when you spend over 10k, it only stabilizes when you move from fragmented activity to a coherent revenue system.\n\nThere is a bunch of more variables which could play a part depending on industry among other things but I hope that helped.

Did you set up proper conversion tracking or have a way to track which leads came from ads?\n\nIf so, at the end of the day, if your ads are *at least* breaking even in post-tax revenue and paying for themselves, you probably don't have to worry so much about doing it perfectly. You don't need to hyper optimize your ads strategy right now if it's doing *good enough*.\n\nStill, it did take me a solid 6-10 months of learning and making mistakes and optimizing my approach before I felt like I was getting more revenue out of them then I was spending. It got to the point where I've had them disabled for the past few months because now we have too much work.\n\nIt's important to not constantly hyper fixate and tweak - make a decision and let it run for a week or two before deciding to analyze your approach. Ads work best on the long game.\n\nMinor advice: if you're a hands on person who helps run a leads based business like I am, you might find way more success using manual CPC vs trying to optimize for max clicks of whatever AI based garbage google &amp; their salespeople wants to sell you. A lot of the other ad strategies are optimized entirely for major brands or people looking to have global reach with the money to waste on it. You will blow a LOT of money on garbage traffic doing max clicks, pmax, or AI run campaigns. If you are running your own ads, do manual CPC and then ideally once you get enough data from that you can run campaigns that target conversions hooks you've set up. Make sure you have a good landing page. That's 80% of the battle right there.",

At 2k to 3k a month, the data is still chunky, so every swing feels personal. That pushes you into constant tweaking, which actually makes the system less stable and more stressful. The irony is the checking creates the anxiety you’re trying to manage.\nWhat changes at higher spend isn’t that fear disappears, it’s that patterns get clearer and you stop reacting to every blip. People who feel calm at 10k plus aren’t braver, they’ve just accepted longer decision windows and fewer levers. The moment you start judging ads day by day, you’ve already lost the mental game.\nIf it were me, I’d simplify before I outsourced. Fewer campaigns, fewer changes, fixed review days. Agencies don’t remove uncertainty, they just move it out of sight while you pay for the privilege. The relief only sticks if the structure is sound. Otherwise you’re still anxious, just with invoices.\nSo yes, you’re overthinking, but it’s understandable. The fix isn’t another dashboard. It’s deciding what you’ll tolerate watching, how often you’ll touch it, and accepting that some spend is the cost of learning, not proof you’re doing it wrong.",

The thing with tools like Claude and Ryze AI is they monitor, but don’t necessarily take the guesswork off your plate.\n\nIf you’re looking for something that actually runs, tests, and scales ads for you without needing an agency or turning it into a full-time job, there’s stuff like Didoo AI that digs into your actual business before building the right audience and creatives. It lets you stop obsessing over every detail and actually see better ROAS without blowing budgets on trial and error. Even better, it emails you a weekly report that spells out exactly what happened and which tweaks it made. For pocket change you get top-tier agency service, It could take a load off your mind.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, stress doesn’t magically go away just because you spend more.

      "selftext": "I’ve owned the business for 9 years now. We do marketing, design, and communications work for non-profits, local governments, and other NGOs. I have a staff of 8 full time employees. They’re all awesome and we do gorgeous, inspiring, impactful work. But I’m frankly exhausted. I’m tired of feeding the revenue monster every month to meet payroll, insurance, and other overhead. Our steady clients for the most part are lovely people with great missions. But they’re getting their scopes continually cut. There are a few who tend to try and take advantage. And I have to be on top of them to make sure they don’t. Navigating health insurance this year has been a nightmare. I wake up in a cold sweat at 4 am wondering if we are going to need to cut staff. We were in a position to buy a building last year but that money is dwindling because no one is willing to sign contracts. I am doing my absolute best to keep the pipeline going but people are just reluctant to sign anything right now. I was a creative director / art director at a multinational agency before I started this agency making well into the 6 figures and I’ve been paying myself half of what I made when I went full time on the business 7 years ago. I’m exhausted and not sure if I can keep going…not sure it’s worth enough to sell (our gross revenue last year was over $800k), or if I need to pair down and just freelance a few of the clients we have contracts with and cut everyone else loose or just shut it down and see what else is out there…so my question Redditors who owned a business, when do you know it was time to walk away?\n\nEdit: employee count (mistype)\n\nEdit: Thank you for the thoughtful comments. Yes I have gotten a lot of value out of what we’ve been able to accomplish especially as it relates to doing good work for the communities we serve. More than money really. But unfortunately still need money to live. I know the margin looks whack. But the location we’re in is a lower cost of living and most of my employees take well below market value in their salaries because of the nature of the work we do. They’re still paid living wages and benefits, but I recognize that their salaries are lower. And I’d really love to pay them more but the clients aren’t multi billion dollar brands themselves. What prompted this post was a client emailing to say they can’t pay for a few months but can they lump hours in the spring and I about lost my mind. To those recommending a pivot, absolutely. We’re looking to move into some other categories for stabilization. It’s just not happening fast enough to keep up with payroll. I recognize I may need to adjust the composition of our staff, but in this economy it’s making my heart hurt to have to do that.",

How was it in Year 2? Year 4? Year 7? Take a second and think back on how you felt at all of those points. If it's been 9 years of thankless grinding, maybe selling is the way to go. If you've found the journey fulfilling up to this point, there's a good chance you'll continue to find it fulfilling once you've steered your way out of these storms. \n\nYour lifetime earning potential running a small agency like you have been is probably never going to square up favorably with a corporate job, but you've been doing this for the last nine years regardless. There's got to be a reason for that, and it's up to you to take a long hard look at yourself to figure out if it's a good reason or not and what needs to change for you to be happy with where you're headed.\n\nEdit: I have a relative who does marketing and design for local interest groups and nonprofits. They tell me that the space is shrinking because customers are using AI to self-serve work they would have previously contracted out, and also because the current administration has cut contracts/grants that had an effect on their customers.

          "body": "The tipping point math is straightforward: what's your hourly rate on client work versus the hours spent editing? If you're billing $150-200/hour for consulting and spending 10 hours editing a video, you're effectively paying $1500-2000 in opportunity cost per video. Even a $500 editor is a massive arbitrage.\n\nThe quality tier that makes sense for B2B educational content is probably $150-300 per video. You don't need motion graphics or fancy effects, you need clean cuts, good pacing, and professional audio. The $50 freelancers on Fiverr are hit or miss and the revision cycles eat any savings. The premium agencies are overkill for 8-10 minute educational videos. Our clients doing similar content usually land in that middle tier with a dedicated freelancer they've built a relationship with.\n\nThe finding process that works: post on Upwork with a specific test project, review 5-6 editors, pay for one video from your top 2-3 candidates, compare results. Once you find someone good, lock them in with consistent work. A freelancer who knows your style and preferences gets faster and better over time.\n\nThe ROI question you're wrestling with is real but probably backwards. You're not making YouTube money yet because you're producing at unsustainable volume. 2-3 videos monthly is the minimum for growth, and if that pace burns you out, you'll quit before the channel gains traction. The outsourcing cost is what makes consistency possible.\n\nThe weekend time is the real cost. You started a consulting business presumably for some autonomy, not to spend every weekend editing videos.",

      "selftext": "For context, I was laid off from my previous job in late 2024. Instead of returning to the workforce as an employee, I decided to start my own business. I offer two main services: graphic design and consulting. In the early months after losing my job, I landed a contract gig in graphic design. I've worked with this client for the last year; they're extremely happy with the services I've provided, and have been slowly increasing my workload. They have been an excellent client to have, simply because they provide me with consistent income. Unfortunately, the rate I get paid for their services is literally a fraction of what I get paid for consulting.\n\nMy contract with them is only $35/hour for design services (keep in mind I had no job and no income when I took this contract).\n\nMy consulting clients range from $100 to $150, depending on the specific needs of their consulting.\n\nIt's been a slow grind getting consulting clients under my belt, but right now I have 2 consistent clients that I'm billing monthly, 1 client I onboarded last month and have started a large project with, and 1 client that is much less consistent but pops up with projects every few months. I also have two prospects in the pipeline - one being a firm that would subcontract me to help consult their clients - so potentially recurring work.\n\n  \nLooking at last year's sales this client is about 10% of my revenue and taking up about 12% of my weekly hours (assuming I only work 40 hours a week - which I'm probably doing closer to 55). \n\nI'm starting to feel like this client is going to hold me back from landing and taking care of much bigger accounts. I've got a subcontractor helping me with sales, but I can only afford about 5 hours a week with them currently.\n\nMy question is more specifically to business owners who were once in a similar position. When did you decide to part ways with a client because you outgrew them or they were holding you back from growing faster? How should I approach this conversation, even if it is telling them I want to cut back hours?\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n",

I can't tell you how grateful I am for what we have done together and I have been trying to make it work at the rate we have always been at. Unfortunately I can't hire additional staff to support you at the current rate and I can't give up hours from higher paying clients anymore. We can negotiate a new rate or I can refer you to someone I know that is occupying the space I was when we started out together.\"",
