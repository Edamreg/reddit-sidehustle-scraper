I shoveled his yeard in under 2 hours, asked for 80 euros he gave me 150, cash, didint even want a receipt.\n\nHe called me yesterday, im doing his yard again today. \n\nOnce you have a customer and you serve them good at some point I dont think I have to spend that much on marketing, I will start social media at somepoint though.\n\nIm kinda dissapointed I only have 1 customer but once the word starts go around about my business maybe next winter ill have more",

I'd of course like to get into more skilled work, where I'll be able to make more in short bouts.\n\nUnfortunately, I realistically can’t take a job/apprenticeship right now to learn a trade, and I don’t have the capital to buy specialized equipment and hope it pays off. I’m a student with a car and can invest under $1,000.\n\nSo what I'm wondering is do any of you have any ideas, or similar stories? I know sometimes it's just worth it to bite off more than you can chew and learn as you go along.\n\nI'm thinking things like drywall repair, TV mounting, painting. All of which I have no experience with whatsoever. There is also things like house cleaning on the list, which I of course have some experience with, but maybe not enough to charge much for it.\n\nAnd as a P.S, I am okay with some ideas that might be well over $1,000. I do want to start things long into the future too, but would prefer some more accessible ideas so I can at least get closer to that capital.",

For those who don't know, it’s basically an arbitrage model.\n\nThe Math: You have High-Net-Worth clients who want a \"Plan B\" passport (St. Kitts, Portugal, etc.). They pay huge government fees ($100k+).\n\n* The Real Estate/Legal Partners: These guys handle the actual filing and paperwork on the ground.\n* The Agency : I handle the client strategy and intro.\n* The Commission: Standard referral fees on a Caribbean file are $20k to $25k per family. EU deals vary but often hit €10k+.\n\nThe Pros: The margins are absurd roughly 90% because I have zero employees and no office. It's fully remote. I just maintain the B2B contracts with the lawyers and field the leads.\n\nThe Cons (and why I’m getting out): It’s a \"hunter\" business. If you aren't working the leads, nothing closes. It’s not passive recurring revenue (SaaS), it’s transactional \"eat what you kill.\"\n\nThe Lesson: I realized that while the cash flow is great for a solo operator, I want to build equity in a scalable product, not a service.\n\nI’m actually seeking to offloading my client assets and partner contracts to so I can focus on a new venture($50K)\n\nHappy to answer questions about how the CBI/RBI industry commissions work if anyone is looking at this vertical. It’s a bit of a \"black box\" industry so the unit economics usually surprise people.",

I was just stuck and getting a little burnt. I wasn't aligned in my business, my systems were fatiguing to manage. Too many tools and software costs.\n\n**What I'm building for myself and eventually the broader market:**\n\n* Basically a lightweight ERP that connects all my business infrastructure (payments, client management, product delivery, analytics) in one place instead of 12 different tools \n* Product creation system - lets me efficiently build and sell interactive GPT products, ebooks, and courses without rebuilding the wheel each time. Same backend, different knowledge products\n\n**The result:** I'm generating way more value with less direct effort because the system coordinates opportunities instead of me manually connecting dots.\n\n**My question for y'all:**\n\nIf you're building knowledge products or running a solo business, which of these pain points hits hardest?\n\n* Your business tools don't talk to each other (data lives in silos)\n* You can't see your actual business health without pulling 5 reports\n* You're the bottleneck for everything because there's no system\n* You have no leverage - everything requires YOUR time\n* Your clients/audience don't collaborate with each other (untapped network effects)\n\nTrying to figure out if this problem is valuable to build as a product or if other creators would want to use/pay for or explore any of this infrastructure.",

Each piece of software potentially has its niche, its strong points, and its drawbacks. The most important is that they have integration points, exposed APIs, at least, to allow you to build some automation. If not, time to move on.\n\nFrom a reporting point of view, again, different systems shouldn't hold you back in an ideal world. There are great (paid) BI tools that thrive on just this - bringing different platforms and systems together, to provide a holistic view. And in the absence of budget, it is totally possibly to build this yourself, in python, using some of the vast viz libraries.\n\n  \nOf course my comments are quite generic, vanilla. So DM me with some specifics. \n\n  \nData always live in silos, even in the best of systems and most efficient of companies. Different roles, rights, privileges. Pissing contests to get to the data, politics that prevent efficient management. So the fact that you at least have all access, god mode, is already a win in my book.",

Keep in mind especially with small businesses, profit margins are small to begin with so getting someone to spend $1500 on a site and $200+ a month on something isn’t always easy, especially if what your offering can be done by themselves in 15 minutes for $50/mo on Shopify. If you get into a pricing war it’s a race to the bottom and then you’re just screwing yourself in the long run. You’ll start burning your word of mouth references by not continuing to provide good service to your existing customers in the long run. \n\nThe issue I’ve ran into and so have my buddies is pricing, you’re going to be bombarded with requests for changes and updates constantly. I recommend putting some thought into how you want to charge for ongoing service, be it monthly, per change, etc etc. failing to do so will turn it into your full time job for little benefit.\n\nMy buddies began taking jobs and outsourcing to India for his sites and it did pretty well for him, but it felt disingenuous to me so I never tried it.\n\nDon’t let any of this talk you out of it, you can make good money on the side with this. Like anything it’s going to take some effort for it to be profitable. \n\nAlso recommend finding a local photographer who can take product/food photos for you as most of my commissions involved that side of things at some point.",

      "selftext": "Alright so I jumped into the vending machine thing back in July after seeing it mentioned here a bunch. Bought two refurbished machines for about $3,200, spent another $400 on initial snacks and drinks and found two spots to put them.\n\nFirst one's in an office building with around 50 people. That one does pretty well, usually brings in $280 to $350 a month. Second one's at an auto repair shop and it's more hit or miss, anywhere from $120 to $180. After buying inventory every month and gas to go restock them, I'm clearing maybe $130-150 profit. Not life changing but it covers my car payment so I'm not complaining.\n\nHere's the thing though - it's not as passive as people make it sound. I'm driving out every two weeks to restock, which takes a couple hours where i need breaks in between to play on myprize. Had to fix a jammed bill thing once that cost me $85. Someone tried to break into the one at the auto shop but didn't get anything, just messed up the lock a bit. The office building location is honestly carrying this whole thing. If I only had the repair shop one I'd probably be breaking even or losing money. I'm learning location really is the whole game here. Thinking about getting a third machine but I'm being picky about where it goes. Not trying to end up with another mediocre spot.\n\nAnyone else doing this? What kind of numbers are you seeing?",

Canny go wrong with condos, HOAs, and sizable businesses with big ass warehouses. They all like their soda. Hell even the Fedex hub had a few",

I am not a professional web developer, but did study it a while ago, so have a bit of background.\n\nI was so impressed with the output, that I thought it could be a tool that other people would use. I bought the domain [www.dryoutside.com](http://www.dryoutside.com) and starting sharing the link in a few places on reddit. Within the space of 24 hours, my website had racked up thousands of visits and I started getting people using my \"buy me a coffee\" link on my about page (which I was surprised about, as I thought it was kind of hidden).\n\nFast forward a few weeks and my website has been picked up by multiple websites and newsletters and is enjoying a global audience, with money trickling in via the buy me a coffee page.\n\nNot enough to go full time with it, but I am impressed that I've been able to spot an opportunity to generate some money from an idea within such a small space of time!",

You used it to test demand.\n\nThe “buy me a coffee” part is especially telling — no hard sell, no funnel, yet people still paid because the tool was genuinely useful.\n\nThis also shows something important:\nyou don’t need a startup idea, you need a useful micro-utility + distribution.\n\nNice work.

      "selftext": "I hesitated to post this because I don’t want it to come across as a “look at me” thing. But when I was starting, I read a lot of posts like this quietly in the background, and they helped me stay sane. So here’s my experience.\n\nTwo years ago, I started an online service business from scratch. No audience, no personal brand, no capital, no insider connections. Just my laptop and phone. It’s a pretty unsexy business, mostly operational, mostly behind the scenes.\n\nIt’s an online, service-based business that helps small to medium companies solve operational capacity issues. We sit somewhere between staffing, operations, and process support. We are based in Australia.\n\n**Year 1: Reality check**\n\nThe first 3–4 months were nothing but rejection.\n\nNo clients and fuck all momentum. Just cold outreach every day and checking my inbox way too often. I seriously questioned whether I was just bad at this, or whether the idea itself was flawed.\n\nWhat made it harder was that from the outside, nothing was “wrong”. The offer made sense on paper. People understood it when I explained it. They just weren’t buying.\n\nEventually, one client came through. Then another. Then another. Growth was slow but real. I was primarily using cold outreach and typically landed 1–2 new clients per month.\n\nBy the end of year one, the business was doing roughly \\~$200k annualised revenue.\n\nSounds fine, but the reality was:\n\n* I was doing *everything* myself\n* I couldn’t switch off\n* Any problem in the business was my problem\n* Time off meant revenue anxiety\n\nMargins were decent, but I had essentially built a job that required constant attention.\n\nA typical day looked like:\n\n* Morning: outbound outreach and follow-ups\n* Midday: onboarding or solving client issues\n* Afternoon: fulfilment work\n* Evening: admin, invoicing, documentation, hiring\n\n**What didn’t work in year one**\n\n* I tried to “work harder” instead of working differently\n* I delayed hiring way too long because I wanted to save money\n* I over-customised for early clients instead of standardising\n* I said yes to the wrong clients out of fear\n\nA few things actively hurt progress:\n\n* Underpricing early to win deals\n* Letting one early client consume a disproportionate amount of attention\n* Avoiding hard conversations with poor-fit clients\n* Confusing activity with progress\n\nMost mistakes came from operating in survival mode.\n\n**Year 2: Thinking differently**\n\nYear two was when things actually changed, but not overnight.\n\nThe biggest shift was how I thought about the business. Instead of asking “how do I do this better?”, I started asking “how does this work *without* me?”\n\nI spent a lot of time studying operators who think in terms of:\n\n* Offers\n* Leverage\n* Throughput\n* Systems\n\nThen I applied those ideas to my own boring, service-based niche.\n\nPractical changes:\n\n* Opened multiple acquisition channels instead of relying on one\n* Hired people to fulfil delivery and admin\n* Documented processes I used to keep in my head\n* Focused heavily on retention and client lifetime value\n\nRevenue per client averages around $1.5k–$3k per month, so growth didn’t come from huge deals. It came from consistency, retention, and not breaking under load.\n\nBy the end of year two, the business is sitting around \\~$800k annualised revenue. The team is now 4 people, and for the first time, I’m not the bottleneck in every decision.\n\nBy year two, the daily routine changed significantly:\n\n* Morning: review key metrics, sales pipeline, delivery health\n* Midday: team check-ins and unblocking issues\n* Afternoon: system improvements or hiring\n* End of day: thinking time (offers, pricing, structure, constraints)\n\n**What surprised me most**\n\n* Boring businesses scale better than exciting ones\n* Consistency beats intensity every time\n* Most growth problems are actually people or systems problems\n* Confidence comes *after* evidence, not before\n* The business grows when you stop trying to control everything\n\n**If I were starting again**  \nA few things I’d do differently:\n\n* Hire earlier, even if it feels uncomfortable\n* Say no faster to bad-fit clients\n* Standardise before trying to optimise\n* Focus on one offer and one ICP for longer\n* Expect the first 6 months to feel pointless\n\n**Final thoughts**  \nI’m still quite far from where I want this business to be.\n\n$800k annualised doesn’t feel like an endpoint. If anything, it’s just the first stage where the business starts to feel structurally sound. There are still plenty of inefficiencies, things that rely too much on me, and areas that would break under real scale. I have much bigger plans for the next year, but I’m also very aware that growth doesn’t come in clean, predictable lines.\n\nIf there’s one thing this experience reinforced, it’s that progress is often a sludge. Long stretches where nothing exciting happens, where the work feels repetitive, where you question whether you’re actually moving forward at all. Most of the meaningful improvements happened quietly, without any sense of momentum at the time.\n\nLooking back, the biggest gains came from continuing to show up during the least rewarding phases. Not when things were exciting or validating, but when it felt boring, frustrating, or slightly pointless. That part doesn’t get talked about much, but it’s where most of the separation seems to happen.\n\nIf you’re early and it feels slow, unglamorous, or heavier than you expected, you're honestly probably on track lol",

It took a while for me to work out what my business was going to do but I think I've found my place in the market. I started the business working at the kitchen table, using my wife's laptop when she wasn't using it.\n\nIt's taken a lot of work for me, especially with a family with three kids and the arrival of number 4 art the beginning of last year. \n\nIn my first year, I worked myself into the ground. I worked day and night. I lost count on the number of all nighters and the lack of sleep was killing me, and having no money with a family to feed, so I just worked longer hours. I wasn't a nice person to be around.\n\nIn my second year, I cleaned up my sleep hygiene. I went to bed when I put my kids to sleep but I would wake up at 4 am to start work at my desk at home. I got some more wins on the board. \n\nNow entering my third year, I've told people that I  probably wouldn't start this business again. It's been too stressful and killing me. \n\nWhen starting a business, people don't realise how much work is involved and the risk you're taking. I knew I had an uphill battle to climb and I put every ounce of effort to make it work. I kept telling myself that 99% of people would have quit but the 1% of people who are successful keep pushing and working hard to win. They push themselves outside the comfort zone.\n\nI'm still solo and avoiding hiring people. This is by design. \n\nI hope this inspires other people who are looking at starting their own business or they are grinding away to one day be successful. \n\nRemember to work smart, have a clear picture of your goals and ask yourself if what you are working on right now is moving you closer to your goals!",

      "selftext": "8 years on Reddit. Many evenings spent reading here. Not a single comment or post, until now.\n\nThis is the short version of the story of how I managed to get completely carried away and basically managed to get manipulated by ChatGPT in the hunt for a side business. TWICE. Spoiler: not super dramatic.\n\n \n\nShort background. I’m 34 years old, male. Living a good life. I live in a townhouse in one of the nicest suburbs of a large city in a Scandinavian country. I have two healthy children. I work full-time as a property manager at a relatively large real estate company. I’ve been at the same company for ten years. I enjoy my job a lot since I’m good at it. I can work about 30 hours a week and handle the job without problems. I can come and go as I please. I pick up my kids from preschool at 16:00 two to three times a week. I’m social, have many friends. Two cars, huge mortgage, etc.\n\n \n\nThe problem may have been that things have become a bit too stable and therefore boring. My job doesn’t come with any bonuses, there are no unexpected joys in professional life. Sure, I sometimes make good deals that together have built a solid career. But there’s never any big unexpected boost and it no longer really contributes to self-realization.\n\n \n\nThat made me, about eight months ago, become obsessed with the idea of a side income. Preferably a passive one. Mostly to prove to myself that I can, but also to have that small extra income stream. I’m not a computer guy, but like everyone else I’ve used AI to clean up texts, structure things, and handle minor legal stuff at work. But in my new pursuit of income, I let my collaboration with CGPT go way too far, and it eventually led me to some incredibly depressing insights.\n\n \n\nThe first project came more from myself. The idea was to write digital guides in PDF format in the children and family segment. In the first and only product, I summarized different methods of sleep training for babies, compressed into a concrete, concise guide, and had a trained pediatrician validate the content and sign it as a quality guarantee. Not a bad idea, really. And during the project I learned how to start a company, build a simple Shopify site, the basics of Google Ads and Meta Ads, the basics of Canva, etc. Long story short: I burned too much money on ads before I was anywhere near breaking even. The insights afterward were reasonable and, in hindsight, likely, as I among other things completely underestimated the need for marketing and the work it entails. Passive income is not passive when you have to keep producing products and maintaining marketing. By the time I launched my little site, I had spent every evening for three months and had basically completely sidelined my regular job. I was almost burned out.\n\nIn short, I was naive enough to believe I would reach break-even with a product priced at $30 and then let it tick along and later calmly scale without further marketing work. The money ran out after 7 sales (satisfied customers), but I was far from break-even on ad costs. But as said, I learned a lot. Among other things, I realized that I have zero interest in building a brand, being visible, building awareness and community. I want to be completely anonymous. That makes it hard to market products, haha. Also incredibly naive to think that in my very limited free time I would learn what people spend their entire professional lives mastering.\n\n \n\nOne problem I discovered too late was that at some point along the way, I started trusting CGPT too much. From pure IT support it became more about discussing business plans and next reasonable step. I became increasingly frustrated because every time we simulated different efforts and scenarios, it turned out that everything was always more demanding, with more steps, and with worse outcomes. Example, CGPT suggests setting up a Meta campaign in a certain way, says it takes a maximum of 40 minutes and you’ll easily get 40 conversions. Result: irritation, two evenings of work, and zero outcome. Every new suggestion and simulation triggered me immensely and I put in more money and time than I should have in hopes of more sales. The result was that I became stressed, easily irritated, almost burned out.\n\n \n\nI paused the project. Felt much better for two months. Until two weeks ago when I fell back in again. A boring day at work and I started getting excited about the idea of finding passive income with a computer again. In short, I let CGPT run the whole thing from start to finish this time. Suddenly I was on completely unfamiliar ground (I know many of you here are incredibly skilled with digital products and social media—I am not). CGPT guided me to buy three Excel templates on Etsy with extended resale licenses, package them as a system— in my case about product pricing—and sell it on Gumroad as a system. I spent a week on this. Here too, CGPT’s projections were continuously lowered over time; time, cost, and difficulty for each step kept being pushed further ahead. The stress from burned money and workload came immediately this time. Difficulty eating and sleeping. Constantly working towards the launch, hoping that now I can launch, then I’ll let it rest for a while and let the revenue start coming in. In this project I had done zero research. I didn’t even know what Gumroad was. So when the launch was done and I began to realize that it requires extensive external traffic for anyone to even consider buying your product, the flop was a fact. Incredibly stupid in hindsight. But I think I believed it would sit on Gumroad, people would go there, search for my product, and it would sell now and then. But there it sits now. 0 views and 0 sales. $400 in total costs for Excel licenses…\n\nThe money was gone. The energy was gone. And I was so incredibly tired of walking around hoping for things and working in my free time only to be disappointed. I have been so incredibly distracted and not present during these periods.\n\nFor some reason I had never been in this forum before, and to comfort myself I went in and read yesterday. My feeling after reading 40+ posts was sadness and the feeling of being a total fucking idiot. Half of what is written here is exactly the same shit that CGPT suggested I should do as free marketing. I even went as far as to create a new Reddit account, copy-paste some fake helpful comments with the expectation that someone would ask follow-up questions and magically ask for my product. I’m really ashamed… But I did realize fairly quickly that it was idiotic.\n\n \n\nIt’s so incredibly depressing and brain-dead, and when you see the pattern of how many people fall into the same generic trap, you just get this dark and bleak feeling about the world.\n\n \n\nI fully understand that those of you who have followed the developments here more closely over the past few years probably think I’m completely lobotomized. And honestly: I’m not a stupid person and I have fairly good self-awareness. That’s why the realization of how I ended up in these failures came as an unpleasant surprise. In total, it amounts to $2,000, and now I’m going to try to forget all. The feeling of failure and loosing myself is way worse than the money. I’m not sure what I even want to get out of this post. I think I’m looking for some kind of closure and using this as therapy for myself. My hunt for a side income remains. There will be a small pause, though. The drive is there, but I need to find my way back to myself. And from now on, all ideas and plans will come from my own gut feeling or relationships in the real world. As a quiet protest, I didn’t even let CGPT translate this text, so you’ll have to make do with my middle-school English.\n\n \n\nIf you have any ideas that don’t consist of digital products or selling your soul online, I’m happy to listen!\n\n ",

Honestly it is hard to get passive income as most of the time you have to set things up before and finding clients is difficult. I suggest you invest your money instead, I read that before investing it you should have at least 6 months of savings then when your money is safely in your savings bank account.\n\nThen with your monthly income you can invest it into ETF or S&amp;P 500 funds for example. Invest 100 or 200 monthly in an EFT over 5 years. These are short term investments that yield more money than traditional ones. Or you can invest over 15 years in those that are sort of retirement funds to find them they should be notified with the year of your retirement for example fidelity fund 2046 and here you save every month the same amount over the 15 years or more.\n\n\nAnd if you really want to make money you could sell old items, or cakes you make locally and add a few bucks in your pocket, there is even a guy who started making  income by renting his camping items to those who didn't want to buy some but it is still a bit of work. If you need more info I am a message away.",

Then had this great idea to create digital products for every service I offer. \n(All in Business Operations) so as you can imagine spent time on that, spent money on the Pro version of Chat GPT, Canva etc , money on signage, business cards and then spent hours getting contact emails and lists from Chat GPT for businesses in my area to reach out to, only for all the details to be incorrect. Hours and hours I’ve spent on this, oh and paid for LinkedIn premium too. So I’d say the output for this has been around $1000. So from say the 2000 emails I’ve sent and 300 LinkedIn message do you know how many people have written back? 0 \n\nI too am at the end of the road.

Etsy digital products work if you focus on one product type like planners, checklists, or templates and improve listings slowly each week. Affiliate marketing works if you pick one niche and keep posting consistently, otherwise you will see nothing for a long time. A faceless YouTube channel can work too, but it is not quick. There are many options, but consistency is the part most people fail at, so pick one lane, set a small weekly routine, and stick to it.",

I was working full time and didn’t have a lot of spare hours either, so burnout was a real concern.\n\nWhat ended up working for me was getting into the financial services space by starting with an agency, rather than trying to invent something from scratch. It wasn’t passive at the beginning, but it was flexible. I could learn evenings/weekends, work with real people, and gradually build systems so the income became more predictable over time.\n\nWhat I liked about this path:\n\t•\tTime flexibility (you decide when you work)\n\t•\tSkills you learn are useful long-term (financial literacy, client conversations)\n\t•\tYou can start small and scale only if/when it makes sense for your family\n\t•\tOver time, parts of it become semi-passive through referrals and team growth\n\nIt’s definitely not for everyone, but for families with limited time who want something realistic and sustainable, it’s been a solid option for me.\n\nCurious to hear what others here have tried that balanced family life without burning out.",

I’ve been making my living online for well over 25 years and just thought I’d give some time to answer any questions you have about the topics I’m familiar with. \n\nI have multiple passive online incomes from websites like travel blogs to social media sites, to AI Youtube channels. \n\nMy social media site basically runs on auto pilot there’s plenty of members who have been on the site long enough for me to give them privileges to ban people who try to abuse the site with spam or whatever. The site makes revenue off premium memberships. You can pay $10 a month to access more features. \n\nMy travel sites and other informational websites did take years to build but it pays off at the end, even small tourist towns travel guides sites get 50k-100k views a month and they tend to get high RPM around $6. But that’s only $300-$600 a month so you can’t live off just one site. I target what’s called “evergreen” content basically meaning content that’s always going to be useful. Unlike content that needs to be updated everyday. \n\nI have a software website that i developed automation software for repetitive tasks for an example scraping tools etc. The software is subscription based on average $10 a month to $99 a month. This is basically passive besides updating or improving the software from time to time. No advertising just ranking on google for keywords. \n\nI have a YouTube channel that I use AI to make videos, currently gets about 10 million views a week with 85k subscribers it’s not exactly passive income though because I believe soon as I stop posting the views will drop…. I literally make the videos while on the toilet most the time while most people scroll the videos on the toilet I’m making them so I’ll call that passive LOL. \n\nI have a 3D printing eBay business this is passive but you need a wife who ships the products but long as you have that, get a 3D scanner and a printer and start scanning everything we sell a lot of replacement parts for everything from your cars cup holder to your ovens knobs to toys. You also can make this completely passive with some print on demand sites I’ve heard but never tried. We don’t make enough profit off each sale so I don’t think a middle man service would work for us but it could for your products. \n\nBut anyways free to ask away and maybe I can answer some questions.

The kids were great. The parents were...not.\n\n2. Asked everybody I knew if they had any potential jobs or work they needed done. I ended up with a weird mishmash of housecleaning, lawnmowing, babysitting, in-home computer repair and setup, bookkeeping, ghostwriting, and package shipping jobs. The package shipping ended up being pretty great--it was for a lab that sent out test kits. Ghostwriting also brought in some decent money.\n\n3. Started an eBay store selling jewelry and accessories. That brought in $2,000-4,000/month after a few months. I started it with about $500.\n\n4. Wrote and self-published books. That brought in over $100K one year, but it wasn't consistent. I'm trying to replicate that again now that I no longer have a corporate job and have more time.\n\n5. Got hired by a content mill. I wrote 10,000 words a week for them in SEO-optimized articles. It was a grind but paid my adult daughter's medical bills.\n\n6. Started a plant nursery on my property 10 years back as a side hustle. It currently brings in $25K in April-May. I'm expanding to farmer's markets and online sales this year.\n\nPretty much what I did each time is take stock of my skills, no matter how trivial, and see if people would pay for them. I also factored in what I love/hate and that ultimately led me to writing and selling plants. But along the way, I did a lot of less enjoyable stuff. I actually enjoyed housecleaning and other physical work, but I kind of hated dealing with people in their homes. Now I deal with people on my property, but hanging with plant people outside is very enjoyable to me.",

          "body": "Sorry for your loss. I will tell you what I did when I was dirt poor. One day, probably by fate, I came upon a dumpster. It was not an ordinary dumpster, it was an Ul-ta dumpster. Back in 2013, dumpster diving had not caught fire on Youtube yet, so many corporate stores did not take precautions. I walked up to a dumpster that had several thousand dollar's worth of discontinued hair sprays. I sold most of them quickly for up to 50 dollars a pop. Seems like I scored near 50 of them. They sold rapidly, because the product had recently been discontinued. And this is also a lesson, if you can source discontinued cosmetic items that people still want, they have high demand and you can make bank. An example of this today is Nautica Competition cologne. Many of us have a bottle or two sitting in an attic from the 90's. They discontinued them and they sale good even today if still fresh. But anyways, dumpster diving is a great way to begin selling on eBay. Just make sure everything is clean and nothing is broken. Always be careful and look for hazardous waste, needles, etc. It is a gray area, so try not to get caught or you could be trespassed. But say if you were a security guard or maintenance worker at a mall overnights, with no one around, you could probably score lots of things to resell while making a normal job paycheck as well, and it would not be trespassing then. I remember I also found tons of Vic Secret NWT lingerie items that had been returned. The store was supposed to cut them up and toss them, but never did. I made thousands on that dumpster as well. And while I am on memory lane, there was a Sports store that tossed 100's of shelf pull baseball hats and trinkets that I sold, and also a Williams Sonoma store that tossed new steel frying pans, cooking machines, and I even scored something like 20 new in can recently expired gourmet coffee beans from them, and also a new with tags Japanese Santoku knife I sold for over 100 dollars. Those were the good ole days for me, which began my passion for treasure hunting.",

Free shipping as well.\n\nI just grabbed a mixed lot of keychains and compact wallets. Since they’re small, shipping is dirt cheap and easy to manage. All fits in a small shoe box. :) The best part is that they don't even sell on eBay or Mercari—they aren't even on Amazon. They seem to focus on big events and trade shows for wholesale instead.\n\nI just listed the stuff under their retail price and it moved fast. It feels like it’s still early days because nobody really knows about them yet. I’m sure eventually they’ll raise their minimums or jump on the platforms themselves, but for now, they don't seem to care about the online side. I'm just riding it while it lasts.",

The people trained to guide them. Through recent surveys, we see that nearly 40% of financial professionals are nearing retirement, and there aren’t enough new ones stepping in.\n\nSo, even simple strategies or guidance can create both passive income and a huge impact—because being prepared to guide families through this wealth transition is becoming one of the most overlooked opportunities out there",

Anyone legit will comment publicly.\n\nFor actually earning online, tbh the \"never do 9 to 5\" thing is kinda idealistic when you're just starting. Most online income takes time to build up. Surveys are flexible and you can start immediately. I use a bunch of different ones and make around $300/month, not enough to live on but it's something while you figure out a bigger plan.\n\nIf you want actual sustainable income, you kinda need to pick a skill and get good at it. Freelance writing, video editing, web development, graphic design, whatever. Then use Upwork or Fiverr to find clients. But that takes months to build up to livable income. The people making real money online either spent years building it or had capital to invest upfront. Just being real with you so you don't waste time chasing get rich quick stuff.",

I’ve been doing it for around 2 years now and so far it’s worked fine for me, but it’s not set-and-forget and definitely not for complete beginners.

Be cautious about adding complex or risky investments just to “do more.” Focus on maxing tax-advantaged accounts, keeping things simple, and only branching into things like real estate or side businesses if you have a real interest or edge.\n\nFor your HYSA, I’d advise keeping it focused on liquidity and stability, not squeezing every last basis point. The HYSA should act as a safe parking spot for emergency funds, short-term goals, and money waiting to be invested. I personally use a tool like Bank Truth to compare savings rates to make sure my emergency fund earns something while I invest. Make sure it’s FDIC-insured, easy to access, and has no fees. It’s okay if the rate moves over time. What matters is that the cash stays accessible, earns reasonable interest, and doesn’t tempt him to take on unnecessary risk.",

          "body": "YouTube has been pretty good for me, not entirely passive but between ad revenue and affiliate income I make around $1200 a month with about 50% of my views each month coming from my old video library. \n\nI’m not a huge fan of survey apps but do use 1Q, Google Rewards, and Meta Viewpoints. 1Q is usually only 1-5 questions and pays between $0.25-$1.50 per survey, the main reason I like it is every survey pays and it pays right away via PayPal (DM me if you want a referral link, referrals pay me $0.25 as well). Google rewards usually has surveys based on your search history and pays $0.15-$0.75 per short survey with a low threshold for payouts ($2.00). Finally Meta Viewpoints rarely has surveys but when they do, they are almost always $5-$10. They are all small but don’t have a bunch of qualifying surveys that don’t pay and have made a few hundred from them. \n\nAs far as true passive income, I try to put some of the money I earn from the other stuff into dividend stock portfolios that pay monthly (Mainly SCHD, JEPQ, DGRO, Main and O). I reinvest the dividends every month for now so I can continue to grow my dividend income in the future.\n\nI occasionally try out other side hustles but nothing super consistent.",

I throw that right into my investment account on a stock that pays out dividends, rinse and repeat. I typically request every 3 Day weekend off and the holidays so I can relax from my actual 9:00 to 5:00 and last year I took home the better part of 17k after taxes.\n\nIf you got a beater that gets relatively good gas mileage I could not recommend it enough!",

      "selftext": "last year, i was sending 100+ cold emails a day to local businesses with bad websites. reply rate? maybe 2%. most of them never even opened the email. i was spending hours crafting messages, following up, and getting nowhere. it was demoralizing.\n\n\n\nthen i had an idea. what if i could show them a working demo of their own website, personalized just for them? not some generic link they’d ignore. something they’d actually watch. so i built a system that does exactly that.\n\n\n\nfirst, i set up a website template that pulls all its info from a google sheet. business hours, services, prices, everything. if they edit the sheet, the website updates instantly. no developer needed. that part alone got their attention.\n\n\n\nbut the real game-changer was the video. i automated a 60-second clip that shows their google maps listing, the website i built for them (with their business name plastered everywhere), and me editing the google sheet live. the website updates in real time on screen. it’s like magic. suddenly, my reply rate jumped to 15-20%. people actually responded.\n\n\n\nhere’s how it works now:\n\n\\- every morning, a script finds 100-300 local businesses with terrible websites.\n\n\\- ai builds a professional site for each one, connected to a google sheet.\n\n\\- a video renders showing their business name and the demo.\n\n\\- an email sends automatically with the video attached.\n\n\n\ni spend 1-2 hours a day replying to interested businesses and closing deals. the rest runs on autopilot.\n\n\n\nthe setup took about 2-3 weeks. i had to build the website template, set up the google sheet connection, and automate the lead gen, video rendering, and email pipeline. it wasn’t easy, but it was worth it. now i’m making $500-800 per deal, mostly from plumbers, dentists, cleaners, and other small businesses where i can reach the owner directly.\n\n\n\nthis isn’t completely passive. i still have to handle replies, hop on calls for bigger deals, and troubleshoot if something breaks. but it’s way better than sending cold emails all day and getting radio silence.\n\n\n\nif you’re curious, here’s what i used:\n\n\\- a google maps scraper for leads\n\n\\- an ai website builder with api access\n\n\\- google apps script or make/zapier to connect the sheet\n\n\\- a video rendering tool (i use \\[tool\\])\n\n\\- a cold email platform\n\n\n\nmy advice? don’t automate on day one. test it manually first. find 10 businesses with bad websites, build them sites, record the videos, and send the emails yourself. see if anyone bites. if they do, then automate the boring parts.\n\n\n\nsome common questions i get:\n\n\\- \\*how technical is this?\\* moderately. you’ll need to understand apis and basic scripting. not beginner-friendly, but not rocket science either.\n\n\\- \\*how much should i charge?\\* $500-800 one-time works. some people do monthly retainers, but i prefer the one-time fee.\n\n\\- \\*is this saturated?\\* no. there are millions of local businesses with terrible websites. plenty of room.\n\n\\- \\*how long until it’s profitable?\\* about 2-3 weeks to build the system, then another 2-4 weeks to close your first deals. not a get-rich-quick thing.\n\n\n\nhonestly, this is a 6/10 on the passive income scale. it’s not “make money while you sleep,” but it’s “make money with 1-2 hours a day after building the system.” if that sounds good to you, i’m happy to answer questions about how i set it up.",

You have to go in thinking \"Ok I'm going to do this thing for this amount of time every day **for a year**.\" You can't start and then give up after a few days or a few weeks because you don't think it's working. That's not nearly enough time for things to get traction.    \n    \nI think it makes it easier to commit to. Because if you go in thinking you're going to do something and it's going to magically take off immediately, yeah you're going to be disappointed relatively quickly. But if you start it thinking you're going to do it for a year and that it's going to take that long to develop, then it's ok if it's not working after 2 weeks, because you're only 2/52 weeks into the journey. You *just* started, of course it's not working. Keep at it.\n    \nThings take time to develop.

      "selftext": "When I first started looking into online marketing, I was honestly just trying to escape the 9–5. I didn’t really know who was legit and who wasn’t—I just knew I wanted out.\n\nI invested in a course that focused heavily on mindset and taught the basics of building a website. It even came with its own software as part of the package. On the surface, everything sounded solid: build a site, add products, and send traffic to it.\n\nWhere things started to feel unclear was the traffic part. The guidance was basically: post on social media, promote your links, and choose between organic traffic (slow but free) or paid traffic (faster but costs money). There wasn’t much strategy beyond that.\n\nI struggled because I didn’t fully understand how traffic actually works. Organic felt painfully slow, paid traffic felt risky, and I kept bouncing between different marketers hoping someone would explain it in a way that finally clicked.\n\nWhat I eventually learned is that traffic is the business. Websites, tools, and products don’t matter much if you don’t understand how to consistently get attention from real people. Once I stopped chasing platforms and started learning how each traffic source actually behaves, things made more sense.\n\nSharing this for anyone early in the process: confusion doesn’t mean you’re failing—it usually means you haven’t been taught the full picture yet.\n\nCurious what part of online marketing was hardest for others when they first started—traffic, mindset, or execution?",

      "selftext": "Hey SEO pros,  \nI’m currently working as an SEO intern, and my manager gave me a task to conduct keyword research and competitive analysis for the topic “Healthcare AI”\n\nI’ve been studying a lot (YouTube, blogs, Semrush Academy, you name it), and after a week of trying my best, this is the report I produced.\n\nOf course, I've used a lot of GPT, Semrush, and manual research to produce this artifact...\n\nI’d really appreciate it if some of you could take a look and tell me -\n\n* **Does this look like the right approach?**\n* **Am I missing something obvious?**\n* **What would** ***you*** **add or change if this were your report?**\n\nI’m still learning and just want to make sure I’m thinking in the right direction before I present it to my manager.\n\n**Any honest feedback would mean a lot to me.**\n\nThanks a ton in advance 🙏\n\nI know you’re all super experienced, and I’d love to learn from your perspective.\n\nHere’s my full report:\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Healthcare AI - Comprehensive Keyword Research Report\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\"Healthcare AI\" is a highly competitive, moderately searched keyword with significant commercial intent.\n\nAccording to Semrush data, this keyword has 2,400 monthly searches(in US) and a Cost-Per-Click (CPC) of $5.41.\n\nHowever, it presents considerable ranking challenges with a Keyword Difficulty score of 80 and 1.24 billion indexed results, making organic ranking extremely competitive.\n\n# Keyword Metrics Analysis\n\n**Search Volume &amp; Demand**\n\n* Monthly Search Volume (Semrush): 2,400 searches\n* Total Indexed Results: 1,240,000,000 pages\n* Trend: Stable and growing, reflecting the expanding adoption of AI in healthcare\n\nThe 2,400 monthly searches indicate a moderately high-traffic opportunity. While not in the ultra-high-volume category (50,000+ searches), this keyword demonstrates consistent, targeted interest from professionals, researchers, and healthcare organizations actively seeking information about AI applications in medicine.\n\n**Commercial Value**\n\n* Cost-Per-Click (Semrush): $5.41\n* Competition Level (Semrush): 0.5 (Low competitive bidding)\n\nThe moderate CPC of $5.41 suggests reasonable advertising costs.\n\nThe low competition value of 0.5 indicates that advertisers are not bidding heavily on this keyword, offering potential opportunities for paid search campaigns at relatively affordable rates.\n\n**Keyword Difficulty**\n\n* Keyword Difficulty Score (Semrush): 80 (Very High)\n\nThis reflects the dominance of authoritative, well-established domains occupying top positions, making organic ranking extremely difficult without exceptional content authority, comprehensive topic coverage, and significant link equity.\n\n# SERP Analysis &amp; Competitor Landscape\n\n**Top-Ranking Results Overview**\n\nThe current Google Search Engine Results Page (SERP) is dominated by authority websites and major technology corporations, with the following ranking positions:\n\nPosition 1: Google AI Health\n\n* Authority: Google (maximum domain authority)\n* Content Focus: AI's transformative potential in personalized, accessible healthcare solutions\n* Snippet Insight: Positions AI as a life-saving tool for medicine and healthcare transformation\n\nPosition 2: NIH PubMed Central - Peer-Reviewed Research\n\n* Authority: National Institutes of Health (.gov domain)\n* Content Focus: Comprehensive analysis of AI as a disruptive force in medical practice\n* Snippet Insight: Academic, research-backed content establishing AI's fundamental transformation potential\n\nPosition 3: ForeSee Medical\n\n* Content Focus: Practical benefits including faster diagnosis, improved treatment, and data-driven decision-making\n* Snippet Insight: Results-oriented approach emphasizing tangible healthcare improvements\n\nPosition 4: Coursera - Educational Content\n\n* Content Focus: Specialization programs for learning AI healthcare applications\n* Snippet Insight: Educational pathway, indicating strong interest in skill development\n\nPosition 5: OpenAI for Healthcare\n\n* Authority: Major AI company (published January 8, 2026)\n* Content Focus: Secure AI products for healthcare organizations\n* Snippet Insight: Recent, authoritative information on practical healthcare AI implementations\n\n# Related Queries &amp; User Intent Analysis\n\n**Primary Search Intent Categories**\n\n1. Application-Focused Queries\n\n* \"How is AI being used in healthcare?\"\n* \"AI in healthcare examples\"\n* \"Healthcare AI tools\"\n\nUser Intent: Users seek concrete, practical examples of AI implementation in healthcare settings.\n\n2. Industry Leadership Queries\n\n* \"Who is leading AI in healthcare?\"\n* \"Healthcare AI companies\"\n\nUser Intent: Competitive intelligence and identification of industry leaders and innovators.\n\n3. Specific Tool/Solution Queries\n\n* \"Which AI tool is best for healthcare?\"\n* \"Healthcare AI chatbot\"\n* \"Healthcare AI app\"\n\nUser Intent: Evaluation and selection of specific AI solutions for healthcare use cases.\n\n4. Career &amp; Employment Queries\n\n* \"Healthcare AI jobs\"\n\nUser Intent: Career opportunity research in the AI healthcare sector.\n\n5. Product Verification Queries\n\n* \"Is there a health version of ChatGPT?\"\n\nUser Intent: Seeking information about consumer-facing AI health tools.\n\n# Content Type Distribution\n\nThe SERP displays a diverse content ecosystem:\n\n1. Authoritative Brand Resources: Google, Microsoft, Oracle, OpenAI official pages\n2. Academic &amp; Research: NIH PubMed Central, Harvard publications\n3. Educational Platforms: Coursera specializations\n4. Industry Analysis: McKinsey strategic insights\n5. Company-Specific Information: Individual AI company homepages\n6. News &amp; Editorial: Harvard Gazette recent coverage\n\n# Search Features &amp; Rich Results\n\n**Featured Snippets**\n\n* Definition-style snippet explaining Healthcare AI fundamentals\n* Comparison table of AI medical documentation tools (DeepScribe, Freed, Tali AI, Suki)\n* ChatGPT Health-specific feature information\n\n**AI Overview (Google AI)**\n\n* Functional description of Healthcare AI\n* Key application categories\n* Benefits summary\n* Real-world implementation examples\n\n**Related Questions**\n\n1. How is AI being used in healthcare?\n2. Who is leading AI in healthcare?\n3. Which AI tool is best for healthcare?\n4. Is there a health version of ChatGPT?\n\n# Search Behavior &amp; Trends\n\n**Recent Activity (January 2026)**\n\n* OpenAI announced Healthcare solutions (January 8, 2026)\n* Harvard Gazette published AI regulation discussion (January 12, 2026)\n* ChatGPT Health features announced (January 14, 2026)\n\nThis recent activity indicates the keyword remains dynamic with continuous innovation and news coverage.\n\n**Related Search Interests**\n\nThe keyword demonstrates strong association with:\n\n* Specific examples and case studies\n* Company and competitive information\n* Tool/solution evaluation\n* Job market opportunities\n* Educational content\n* PDF resources and comprehensive guides\n\n# Ranking Difficulty Factors\n\nThe keyword difficulty score of 80 is driven by:\n\n1. Authoritative Domain Monopoly: Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and NIH occupy top position.\n2. High Page Volume: 1.24 billion indexed results create extreme competition\n3. Broad Topic Coverage: Every SERP result covers healthcare AI comprehensively\n4. Recent Authority Content: Established sites continually update content\n5. Semantic Relevance: Multiple related keywords (applications, companies, tools) fragment search intent\n\n# Strategic Recommendations\n\n**For Content Creation**\n\n1. Niche Specialization: Focus on specific AI healthcare applications (e.g., \"AI in Radiology,\" \"AI in Drug Discovery\")\n2. Comparison Content: Create detailed comparisons of specific AI tools\n3. Case Study Development: Document real-world implementation examples\n4. Thought Leadership: Publish original research and unique insights\n5. Video Content: Develop visual explanations and demonstrations\n\n**For Keyword Targeting**\n\n1. Long-Tail Variations: Target specific applications and use cases\n2. Question-Based Keywords: Focus on \"How to,\" \"Why,\" and \"What\" questions\n3. Company-Specific Keywords: Target individual AI company names\n4. Technology Stack Keywords: Target specific AI technologies (LLMs, computer vision, etc.)\n5. Job/Career Keywords: Capitalize on employment-related searches\n\n**For Paid Search**\n\n1. Moderate CPC ($5.41) presents reasonable advertising opportunity\n2. Low competition bidding allows for cost-effective campaigns\n3. Target high-intent keywords (tools, companies, specific applications)\n4. Focus on healthcare industry professionals and researchers\n\n# Conclusion\n\n\"Healthcare AI\" represents a highly authoritative keyword with moderate search volume (2,400 monthly searches) and significant commercial value ($5.41 CPC). However, the keyword difficulty score of 80 reflects extreme ranking challenges dominated by technology giants and authoritative institutions. The SERP composition indicates that users seek comprehensive, authoritative information spanning applications, market leaders, specific tools, and career opportunities.  \nSuccess with this keyword requires either:\n\n1. exceptional authority and content comprehensiveness for organic ranking,\n2. niche specialization in specific subtopics, or\n3. strategic paid search investment at reasonable costs.\n\nThe keyword remains highly relevant and actively updated, making it a valuable long-term target within strategic healthcare AI marketing and content strategies.\n\n**Semrush Data Referenced:**\n\n* Search Volume: 2,400\n* CPC: $5.41\n* Keyword Difficulty: 80\n* Competition: 0.5\n* Results: 1,240,000,000",

It was an \"acct review.\" email basically said \"someone disputed a charge, we need to chk if u're a criminal, talk to you in 2 biz days.\"\n\nMy subscription box does about $90k a month. For two days, my store was in \"maintenance mode.\" New customers? Gone. Existing subscribers trying to update their card? Error message. I couldn't even log in to see who was trying to pay me\n\nI spent $1,200 on ads that drove to a dead page. My \"backup plan\" was Authorize .net... which was useless because the entire shopify storefront was disabled. the platform wasn't my partner; it was my landlord who changed the locks becz a neighbor complained\n\n\"review\" ended. no apology. the chargeback? customer lost their card and reported it stolen. bank's auto-system filed disputes for every recent charge. I won the case with tracking. My \"penalty\" was $1,200 in burned ads, 72 lost signups, and the realization that my biz is built on a foundation that can be paused on a whim\n\nso, for the scaled businesses here: what's ur actual, no-bullshit plan for when ur platform decides u're a risk for a day? not theory. what's in place rn that would keep u taking money if ur storefront vanished tomorrow?",

The logic says I should use these tools to compete with the big companies. But every time I try to scale my outreach, I just feel like I am polluting. The thing is, if you send 1000 emails and get 0 replies, you are not doing sales. You are just annoying people.\n\nI decided to stop with the extreme automation. It feels stupid to do this manually in 2026, checking forums one by one, reading comments, trying to find that specific person that has a problem today. It's slow. It feels like swimming against the current when everyone else is on a motorboat.\n\nBut when I actually find friction and I talk to the person, they answer. They answer because they realize there is a human on the other side, not a script.\n\nMaybe the \"big fish\" can afford to burn their reputation with spam. But as a small builder, trust is the only currency I have. If I lose that, I have nothing.\n\nJust a thought for those who are struggling to get their first users.

Big companies can't do manual outreach at scale, but you can spend 30 minutes finding 5 perfect people and actually help them. That converts way better than 500 automated messages.\n\nOne tip: when you find those manual wins, ask them where else people like them hang out. You're not automating the outreach, you're learning where to focus your manual effort. Still human, just smarter about where you spend the time.\n\nTrust is expensive to build and cheap to destroy.

But admitting you had help doesn't fit the narrative entrepreneurs want to sell.\n\nYou had family money for startup capital. You had connections from your expensive university. You had a safety net if things failed.

Every sentence ignored the massive support system that person had. Partner who paid bills during the lean years? Never mentioned. Parents who let them live rent-free?

I think that pushes it too far.\n\nWe absolutely should recognize the people in our lives that supported us on our journey, and that (depending where you live) that a stable structure around you was helpful, but support does not mean doing the work and actually taking the risk.\n\nThere have always been entrepreneurs, in every kind of society, so that can be omitted by default - it's not helpful and not actually a form of modesty.\n\nEven when absolutely NOT solo, very often it's 1 person that was the main force behind success. I had no family investment or support, am not married, and had no connections for my business. I put in my life savings. I did bring on some people to share the work over the years, but none invested their life savings, and all eventually gave up while I kept going. Now I'm doing pretty well. Did they help? Yes. But did they bear the same burden I did? Not even close. I personally wouldn't sell this as a solo founder journey though (although my next startup I will).\n\nBut I have a feeling this is not about entrepreneurs that built real businesses, but more about people selling snake-oil style courses?\n\nI imagine most will agree that it's annoying and likely a general bad for society. But it will always be here. Maybe you can invent some software that can help consumers make better decisions.",

          "body": "I think this hits on something deeper about how we frame success versus how we experience it. The “I built this alone” narrative often resonates because it simplifies complexity into a story that’s easy to tell. It doesn’t reflect reality. Most successes are built on networks of support, systems, mentors, community infrastructure, and the ecosystem that makes opportunity possible.\n\n\nThat said, there’s also something to be said for the personal agency in execution. Two people can have the same resources, but only one might put in the sweat, iteration, and discipline needed to move an idea forward.\n\n\nI think the record should show both elements: acknowledge the support that made a thing possible AND the individual choices that drove it over the finish line.\n\n\nCurious, for people here who do talk about having built something “alone,” what do you think that phrase is trying to communicate? Is it about resource constraints? Autonomy of decision? Ego? Or something else?",

          "body": "The reason why I don’t agree with people claiming that they are self made is because nobody ever talks about the help. For example, if you have an assistant, a bookkeeper, an accountant, someone baby sitting your kids, any type of help, I don’t consider that self made. Did you know that majority of new business have to close down because of health insurance? Having good health insurance as self employed is necessary. \nIf you have a partner that takes care of the household, that is help. If you can afford to outsource, that is no longer self made. \nIf you can work 100 plus hours on your business, your entrepreneurship journey, how do you have time to do anything else?\nHave you tried working on a business while still trying to maintain a part time or full time job and have to take care of a household all on your own? The problem is, everyone tells you, you just have to work all day and night, just focus on your business. \nBut they never tell you the help they had. We are not made to make every decision on our own. I have a great example of a guy I knew that, even though he had a great support system that put him to the peak of his success, everything started crashing down when he stopped using his support system. \nIf you do not have a good support system, having no support system is better than a bad one. \nI’ve learned that trying to manage everything myself, I can’t do it alone. Now I’m learning how to outsource. I wish a “self made” entrepreneur would point this out in very simple words. \nThere is no such thing as self made. You can come up with an idea on your own, but the execution might not be great on your own. And if you want to grow your business, okay you’re saving money by doing it on your own, but time is money. I rather outsource than spend way too much time on something that I can pay someone to do it better than I can.",

The money risk is finite, but the mental load is constant because every decision feels like it could compound in the wrong direction.

Having some kind of external cadence helps too, like regular reviews or deadlines, so your brain does not spin endlessly. Loneliness is common because responsibility removes the feeling of being validated by default. Most people who stick with it learn to trust their process more than any single choice.

There’s kind of two vectors that converge with entrepreneurial experience:\n\n1. You learn the methods the madness, coping with chaos, making the calls, techniques in intuition and creativity etc. And you get better at managing it all personally. Getting timing right. You learn from failures and learn even more from successes (success is where you get patterns you know work, and can now remix those patterns to the next thing).\n2. You learn how to make the chaos transform into insight and actual information about the product and businesses you are building. You learn things like pretotyping, lean startup, Osterwalder’s 3 fits, MVP, and a wealth of other ways to reduce your risk and accelerate your learning. And maybe most of all you learn that there’s this thing called the customer. Wonderful source of insight and knowledge on what works, what they are willing to pay for and how. Much of chaos goes away when you go to the customer with decisions you would need to make, and get their input on the choices. Or just use design thinking as a strategy: really listen to the customer, empathize with their situation, and learn heavy from it. Learn to ask questions like: “I have a legally binding purchase order here for my product, it’s 75,000$ would you sign it right now?” And when they don’t sign it, asking “what would it need to have to for you to sign it right now?” And then you listen very carefully what follows.\n\nThere’s even a literal science to this.

I started doing a daily scorecard where I track just 3-4 key things each day so I have concrete proof that I'm moving forward even when my brain is telling me I'm failing.

      "selftext": "Ok here goes... \n\nI have huge success making 8figs a year, and horrible penalties (millions in fines for mistakes over the years). I replaced myself as CEO about 16 months ago and am completely lost. I have built a large business, many in fact. But because I recently I replaced myself with a more capable leader in my largest company and now feel completely useless. I don't run anything anymore. I dont hire/fire. I check in biweekly at most. I almost lost my key staff today because I have been so overbearing and basically not trusting them as well as second guessing decisions. \n\n  \nThey gave me their 60 day notice today, and I refused to take it, instead we agreed that I would work on my seperation/reactive attachment issue. I need to stop interferring with the people that put in charge. We agreed to make goals with deadlines, and if I interfer 1 more time, they will quit. If they dont meet the goals and deadlines that they set, I will ask them to leave.\n\nNow my identity. \n\n  \nMy entire identity for 20+ years has been building and running businesses. I get mailbox money now that I dont earn daily, which sucks trust me. I am having issues in my marriage and home life because I am misrable knowing that I literally have no business purpose any more. \n\nYes. I should be happy. But I am genuinely miserable. I have a beautiful family, beautiful house. I have had more sports cars than most athletes. This is not to boast, its to send a clear message. None of this is or ever made me happy (Except my family, love them! :)).\n\n  \nIm sitting here as a multi-millionaire, with so much business intellect, and 0 outlet. I dont want to make some cheesy course, or consult. \n\n  \nI just want to talk about business, day in and day out, I have owned and invested in so many markets because its all exciting to me. But the internet has created a somewhat nasty reputation to anyone who wants to help people solve problems.\n\nQuestion: \n\n**How if at all, can I genuinely help people when they are building or built great businesses?**\n\nI thought about angel investing and mixing fun content like dave ramsey when people call in, I thought about interviewing other successful people (easy to call on when I mention who I am). \n\nI am not gatekeeping info, Ill help if I can, but the few people that I have tried to help publicly, like instagram and such, just want me to invest. Which I have in the past, but most times I say no. And most times they need someone to hand hold. Not anwer questions.\n\n  \nPlease help GODS of reddit! :D \n\nGenuinely appreciate you for listening",

As someone about to finally do something with my LLC I have a million questions and no one to ask them besides strangers on the internet. If your goal is to help people, and not get boring or money hungry pitches all day, I feel like your best bet for fulfillment would be mentorship. Or helping people who aren't even at the investment stage. Watch something grow from just the idea, helping with budgeting and gov docs, taxes etc. Might not be exciting, but if you believe in the person or in the idea, you could scratch that itch without needing to sink all your time and energy into it. Then again, if things not being under your full control is a problem area, that may need to be addressed prior. Alternatively, create. Seems to me a lot of broke creators are really happy, and a lot of rich people tend to lack that outlet. There's a middle ground somewhere I'm sure, but maybe help a music or art teacher scale in exchange for some lessons and material.",

Take the family on vacay to some island.  Go to one of those Tony Robbins seminars in Fiji.  Or just listen to the audio of his programs.  The personal development programs in your case, not the business programs. Trust me it will really help to find out what you want. It sounds like you need to look inside and figure out who you are now and what you want.\n\nWhat problems in teh world could you solve? If you have that amazing business ability, can you put it toward creating charitable organizations that would truly help people? Here and in other parts of hte world? A spiritual search maybe might aid this.\n\nBut before doing anything it sounds like you need to look inside and figure out who you are at this stage of your life and what that looks like without this or that business. Is that all you are?  If they all went south tomorrow, and you were left with nothing, no businesses, no cars, no fancy house, no fancy clothes, who would you be?  Would you give back?  To who? Would you pick up a long ago abandoned interest or hobby?  What type of person would you be?  What really matters?  Who in your life really matters? What would you notice that previously got lost in the whirlwind. Are you missing things in  life that are right in front of you? Material things come and go, and in the end you can't take them with you. Some major event could happen tomorrow that affects all of it. What's important is the people around us, relationships and what we give back.\n\nOne of the good clarity exercises Robbins talks about is the Rocking Chair test -where you imagine yourself at the end of your days, sitting in a rocking chair, and imagine what you are glad you did and what you regret, and what you regret NOT doing. My paraphrase.\n\nSome therapy is a very good suggestion if you have the right therapist.  Good luck to you.",

Every found I know goes through a dark valley of self-doubt once they're no longer instrumental in the business (though usually you see it after the sale of a company, not  the professionalization of the management.)\n\nI certainly struggled.  We were 23 years in, when we sold.  And within about a week after life changing money showed up in bank account, I found myself staring at an empty calendar and wondering what the hell I'd done.  And what I was going to do.\n\nYale University published a study on this &gt;   \n[https://som.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2025-04/Exploring%20Six%20Key%20Decisions%20Post-Exit%20Entrepreneurs%20Will%20Have%20to%20Make.pdf](https://som.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2025-04/Exploring%20Six%20Key%20Decisions%20Post-Exit%20Entrepreneurs%20Will%20Have%20to%20Make.pdf)\n\n\n\nAlso, I'd consider giving EO another chance.  It's changed a lot in ten years.  There are entire forums of ex-founders who have moved up to chair or sold the firm. You may need to advocate for yourself to get into one of these - but I expect you'd find the conversations gold.\n\nOne last thought?  don't jump into anything too quickly.  give yourself some time to adjust, as hard as that is.  Making decisions mid-identity crisis doesn't usually produce happy outcomes. \n\n",

Tackle hard questions and help contribute to scientific progress where there is a legacy and purpose beyond just profit.\n\nSame with charitable giving in general. Sustainable charity work is hard to come by - supporting charities building systems that benefit their communities and help their members improve their situation is very similar to your Dave Ramsey idea, because those folks aren’t looking to sell a startup for a specific ROI they’re just looking to create a living that improves their life. And mentorship in those spaces is entirely possible. \n\nSimilarly, helping non-profits build a non-donation based revenue stream is something that can feed your need for building while also having a higher purpose than profit. Meaning helping charities be less reliant on donations - as global giving can fluctuate and it helps ensure their long term survival. (They can’t make a profit of course but they can do activities that generate revenue).",

Knowing the mistakes you made, your approach to leadership and where your mental health is, are you really ready to offer mentorship or to start something that is focussed on impact and not income and growth?\n\nThis is a similar story to an acquaintance of mine. He built a business over a number of years and sold it last year. He pocketed millions and stills gets a residual income off the business.\n\nAfter he transitoned out staff moral and employee satisfaction went up, churn went down, quality went up. Despite being a big and busy business he was never able to let the people he hired do the job...he was an angry, overbearing micromanager.\n\nOn the outside he became unbearable to be around. He has spent years working insane hours and only thinking about and talking about business and money. He forgot how to have a day off and keep himself entertained or mentally nourished.\n\nHis kids are now grown up, starting university and absolutely do not need him trying to help...they got this far without dad being a reliable, supportive presence so why now.\n\nHis wife has her own life, hobbies, friends and a job and will probably move out soon.\n\nThey don't have any real memories of being a family together. Family vacations were actually his wife taking the kids on her own while he stayed buried in the business.\n\nOf course he thinks he is the one that has sacrificed so much to give his family a 'life' but I think they would have been fine without the trappings of...things...if they had a better family life.\n\nSo anyway this is a long way of saying to literally go for a walk in nature every day, turn your phone and emails off, play with the kids, do housework, see your friends, have lazy days on the couch, go on a trip...for a year...you are burnt out and have trained yourself to only think one way.

A sense of envy washed over me after seeing this, so I apologize in advance for it. \n\nIt has been 16 months since you physically detached from being CEO, have you tried getting professional help to help you refocus your purpose and energy? Have you taken the time to wind down from years of cortisol filled days and accepting that is time to fully close a chapter? It seems to me that it will be good to start with Journaling your self reflections and starting to vocalize or in this case write down these feelings. I can tell you are a problem solver by how successful you have been with your business for the past decades. Writing things down may help you to not just get it out but materializing these feelings into something physical may in a way kick in your problem solving skills on solving the big problem of inadequacy that you are currently facing. Life is short, there is so much more to see and learn, even maybe teach as well as a way to give back in a way. \n\nHave a good life, you have the tools for it at your disposal.",

Build that person up, build your business up, rinse and repeat. \n\nThis might allow you the ability to get back in the trenches with small teams, build people back up and mentor them again, and build a portfolio of assets that will cash flow for you.\n\nAs for the team at your current business, one of the greatest lessons I learned from a CEO from a large company, was don’t try and be involved in everything. You hired these people because they are talented, capable, and you have to get out of their way and let them do what they do best. Doesn’t mean you fully walk away, but at that stage you’re prob going to be set at setting direction and objectives and letting them figure it out and execute.",

I want to help and drives me to do so. Its honeslty overwhelming at times. My 2.5 yr old daughter is why i do it. I hope she can have a better life then i did in my war torn childhood. (When i was 9 i was shot. Burried alive in mass grave. Crawled out at night. Over the river and through the woods. Into hands of evil and a concentration camp.) Now i am here for a reason. Funding businesses and solutions is what i am good at, but only enjoy the people who are kind, honest, and really want help from me. 1000s have just tried to use me. 1000s of investors, brokers, banks, etc have \"backdoored\" me.... its been a wild ride, and i have learned a ton. Hopefully one day i can take less on, have a good team to depend on. I do everything myself. From intake calls, strategies, solutions, UW convos, presentations, and work is on my mind 24/7.\n\nIts the challenges of my industry and the rewards are great.

Just like in 2008 I see there is this combination of loss of jobs and new startups launched, and this is expectable. In the next couple of years it will only speed up, we will see more solo founders, more people trying to launch a business, and more failure stories. What's different is the scale of making new things: it's so easy now to launch something small, not very data-savvy, and of course it needs AI in it.\n\nOversaturation is coming our way with a crazy speed, many founders price their services cheaper and cheaper, and we all know where it leads. Someone sees it works, repeats, sets the price lower.. It's like a downward spiral we are rapidly moving into.\n\nJust in the last couple of months I heard founders pith one and the same idea in different variations about 10+times, it starts looking like a \"Groundhog Day\" of ideas!\n\n  \nI am very excited about physical products and unsexy startups I'm advising, since at least they have a better chance to stay afloat. Especially devices, robotics, everything linked to meds / personal care, or even food. These have a better chance of a successful exit.\n\nJust Friday thoughts of an elderly person, would be glad to see what are your observations.",

A race to the bottom for generic, easily copied offerings, and a smaller group that survives by being closer to real-world constraints, customers, or physical systems. That’s probably why unsexy and physical products feel more attractive right now. They’re harder to fake, harder to clone, and harder to undercut overnight.\n\nIt feels less like the end of entrepreneurship and more like the end of “easy” entrepreneurship.

We noticed it's often easier to get cited here over traditional SEO since that landscape is super competitive and companies with the most money usually wins!

Our team went from drowning in repetitive questions to actually solving complex problems and building relationships with customers.\n\nOrder tracking automation saved our ops team around 5 hours every single day. Just eliminated all the manual status lookups and update requests. Sounds boring but the time savings compounded fast.\n\nLead generation might be the wildest ROI shift. We went from $200/month on traditional tools to like $10/month with AI workflows doing better work. The targeting got more precise because we could iterate and test way faster.\n\nThe bigger shift has been cultural though. Once people on the team see AI handle the grunt work well, they start spotting more opportunities themselves.

Talking about money, I am the only one who touches it, spends it and writes the checks. I have heard too many stories of the trusted employee embezzling from the company. 4A. Because I am in the numbers weekly, I have pretty good handle on our finances but no bookkeeping for me.\n\n5. You will have competitors. Your product most likely will be similar to theirs. \nDon’t be an exact copy. Make your product a little different/better. Be willing to be able to explain what differentiates yours from theirs. Always be innovating. Thinking outside of the box has led to a new product (plus a patent on it) and has opened a totally new market for us.\n\n6. Never compromise on Quality.",

It’s a small group of very human skills that compound over time.\n\nFirst is **learning how to learn**. Markets change, ideas fail, and assumptions break. Entrepreneurs who survive are the ones who can admit “I was wrong,” learn fast, and adjust without ego.\n\nSecond is **basic financial sense**. You don’t need to be an accountant, but you must understand cash flow, margins, and how long your money will last. Most businesses don’t die because of bad ideas but because of cash quietly runs out.\n\nThird is **selling and listening**. Not pitching listening. Real entrepreneurs hear what customers actually say, not what they hope to hear, and then shape the business around that.\n\nFourth is **emotional control**. Some days feel like you’re winning the world, some days like you’ve ruined your life. Being able to stay steady, make decisions without panic, and keep going matters more than motivation.\n\nAnd finally, **patience**. Overnight success is usually ten years of boring work. If you’re okay with slow progress and small wins, you’re already ahead of most people.\n\nYou can learn tools anytime. These skills take time but they’re what really carry you through.",

Consumers are upset that AI content is being pushed on them... Where the \"magic\" of content is that it is created by humans for humans. AI detatches the human from the creativity of consumed media in any form.\n\nPersonally I go out of my way to avoid content that is generated by AI because it feels inauthentic. So do a lot of others, and it's not a great look when consumers actively go out of their way to consume your products.\n\nI expect AI to thrive in areas where complex static computing often fails. Recognition, manufacturing, decision making, and tooling. I expect AI to fail on anything media related. Unfortunately an absolute shitload of investment and usage is in media generation. It will collapse, and from the rubble will rise the actual consumer usecase... Just like the internet bubble.",

You're just making it more complicated.\n\nKeep it stupid simple early on. A CRM to track leads. A way to call people. A way to email. That's it. You don't need orchestration and enrichment and all this other stuff until you're doing real volume.\n\nThe real question isn't \"what tools\". it's \"what's the bottleneck?\" Most of the time when people are switching tools, they're avoiding the real problem. their sales process sucks or their reps can't sell.\n\nApollo, Clay, Zapier... all fine tools. But none of them are going to teach your team how to isolate objections, do proper discovery, or actually differentiate from competitors. That's what drives revenue.\n\nSo before you go chasing the next tool, ask yourself this: can your team consistently close 30% of qualified leads?

She does not fire people, she is against it... but I think he has pushed it as far as she is going to take it.",

Access to your business Facebook page is connected to your personal Facebook account. It's against the TOS to maintain more than one personal Facebook account. When you say \"have separate emails\" for all your accounts... how does that work? They've specifically designed their systems to require a business owner to link all their accounts to a single personal profile.

I once spent 3 hours at dinner listening to him giving me a line by line breakdown about how much he hated Quickbooks. \n\nThe reason why you hear about crypto, dropshipping, and AI so much online is because most people who think they're interested in making money, are looking for ways to make money without much work. Everything you listed is easy to create a course to sell to those dreamers. \n\nMeanwhile there are thousands of possible businesses. \n\nIf you are interested in a local service business - ask ChatGPT for a list of local professions. Then start Googling them. Pay attention to every business in every strip mall area you drive by. Look at every vehicle that has a business name on it. \n\nResearch \"boring businesses\" - this was the hip entrepreneur term for 2025. It means businesses like lawn care that can earn alot of money but doesn't get the press the way an AI startup will. \n\nAnother option -listen to My First Million episode 779 - about franchises.

We are concerned that we are overpayng some taxes \n\n2. We’ve noticed many frequent mistakes from both payroll and accounting providers\n\n3. Salary miscalculations and Incorrect payslips every other month\n\n4. Some issues managing employee medical checks\n\n5. And on top of this, VERY slow replies and poor English support (I guess, you get what you pay for- and in Spain apparently, English is not so used). But we learned the lesson the hard way so we are now looking for alternative local providers in Spain.  \n\nPlease let me know if you have any good EOR companies in mind that could help us fix the above. Ideally a provider that provides both the payroll and accounting services in Spain, but any suggestions are welcome!! Thank you! ",

Repeated payslip errors and slow replies are red flags, not “Spain being Spain.” Same with medical checks falling through the cracks. Someone should clearly own that. Local payroll plus local accounting often breaks down once you’re a foreign company. The two vendors don’t really coordinate, and when something’s wrong, you end up chasing both. That’s usually where the frustration comes from. If you want fewer moving parts, an EOR can help. The main upside is accountability. One provider owns payroll, taxes, compliance, and admin, so you’re not stuck mediating. I haven’t run Spain myself with Remote People, but I’ve heard solid feedback from HR managers who did. Mostly about things being calmer month to month, fewer mistakes, and faster responses. Not perfect, but better than juggling locals. So yes, it makes sense to rethink the setup. Ask any provider very directly how they handle errors and response times. That’ll tell you a lot.",

      "selftext": "So I’ve worked at a small waffle and coffee shop for about 3 years. It’s a small operation in downtown of a large city. The owner recently offered to sell me the business for $65,000. His reasoning is that he wants to free up capital to put into another business he’s scaling, and he feels comfortable passing this one on to me since I already run much of the day-to-day. They’re hardly there in person at this point, maybe once a month or every other month to collect the cash. We’re located in a small food hall under an office building, so there’s a constant supply of costumers from there. Not enough to keep our numbers where we want, but it helps make sure we’re never actually dead I think. We’re also located right by the theatre district so whenever there’s ballet shows or operas it guarantees some traffic. The rent is also taken by the food hall as a percentage of our sales so whenever it’s slow we don’t get hurt too badly. Another factor maybe worth considering is that we partnered with Starbucks, so we buy their products and can sell them, something he already paid the license for.\n\nSome numbers:\n\n•\tMonthly sales usually fall between $5k–$7k per week. Highs of 8k+\n\n•\tAverage month is around $30-35k. Busy months can get close to $40k, slowest (usually just January) is around 25\n\n•\tHe claims the business nets about $3k–$4k in profit per month\n\nWhat I’m trying to figure out:\n\n•\tOn the surface, does a $65k asking price sound reasonable given those numbers?\n\n•\tWhat specific documents should I ask to see before even considering this seriously?\n\n•\tWhat questions should I be asking about expenses, lease terms, debt, equipment, etc.?\n\n•\tWhat are common things first-time buyers overlook in situations like this?\n\nI’m not rushing into anything — just trying to educate myself before I say yes or no. I appreciate any insight from people who’ve bought or sold small businesses before.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEdit : I’ve seen it brought up and forgot to mention originally, but equipment is rented from the food hall so we don’t pay for repairs.\n\nThis was a bit of a passion project originally for the owners, but they’ve been too busy with their other jobs and their family to dedicate the time theyd like to it. I have a great relationship with them and consider them friends at this point. All the other owners of the stalls in this food hall are personally here most if not every day, but it’s been a point of pride for me to manage this place without them needing to be here. We have a small team but everyone’s awesome and covers whenever needed\n\nThe 3-4k profit would be after all expenses, including my current wages and inventory. There’s also ways to save money, for example they spend a ton on delivery for ingredients since theyre too busy to go to the store themselves.\n\nAlso this is not a franchise.",

          "body": "First off, everyone here is right about the lease. I see you said it's a food hall, they and malls are notorious for jacking up rents based on foot traffic increases so make sure you see the actual lease you are committing to and ask if it is a flat rate or \"percentage\" lease. Given you stated that the equipment is provided I have a gut feeling your rent will be percent or per sale based in whole or part. The equipment rent is weird to me, if not bundled in the lease you need to know the exact costs associated with it. Same goes for the rest of the FF&amp;E, utility share, etc... There are hidden costs all over with a business like this and everything from your cups to your water bill can impact your profitability if the costs go up even slightly. \n\nSecond, owners do sometimes step away from cashflow generating businesses at a modest sum, but this is the exception NOT the rule. Anyone operating an absentee or near-absentee business successfully and profiting from it is unlikely to sell at a low cost and typically seeks a higher multiple due to the low effort required to operate and high cost of them to replace that recurring revenue. Be open but skeptical (you are on the right path asking what to request from them). Ask them casual questions like what they're going to do with all of the free time they have. Answers like retirement or traveling are often acceptable (especially if they are older) but if they don't seem to have any idea there's a good chance you have something lurking they are worried about. A good example right now is single owner liquor stores. As alcohol sales decline and rents increase, many of these are selling at a low price trying to exit the market and pivot to something else rather than lose everything. Think about it from all angles you possibly can. \n\nThird, when a business owner tells you they make $3k to $4k in profit each month you should ask if that includes their cashflow (or owner draws / owner pay). If it doesn't, that means that you'll personally take home this amount or about $48,000 pre-tax if you hire someone to replace you (add in your current income if you can do it all yourself). If it does include their owner draws  /cashflow it means you'll make less than this and need to find ways to support yourself while building the business. You're in Washington with no personal income tax but you will need to collect sales tax and pay the Business &amp; Occupation (B&amp;O) Tax if I'm seeing this correctly. I'd investigate the taxes being paid now and if there are any changes slated for the future as part of the due diligence since the total profit is quite low.",

          "body": "Let’s say $3K/month net, so $36K/year profits.  Most coffee shops sell for 2x to 3x seller’s discretionary earnings.  That gives a valuation between $72K and $108K.\n\nSo the price seems OK, but you need to factor in add-backs and takeaways.  So if, for example, one owner does the accounting for free and you are going to have to pay for it, take that away from profits.  If the shop pays for the owner’s kid’s cell phone, add that back into profits.  Also, you have to account for any tax shenanigans, like off-book pocketing of cash sales.\n\nIf the owners are putting in very little effort, and it is netting $36K a year, there is some value being realized.\n\nNormally, I would say an opportunity like this is ideal for a seller-financed deal.  You have leverage, as the person who runs the shop day to day.  You leave, he has a burden, which puts you in a negotiating position.  But it sounds like he needs the capital, so he might not be willing to finance a sale.  Usually something like 50% down and remainder from cash flow over 3-5 years is viable and forces the owners to stand behind their profit numbers - no earn out as promised, no payment.\n\n10% net profit is top-quartile earnings for a coffee shop.  They are very finicky though in terms of business model, so you need to model this shop in a spreadsheet and ask questions like “what happens if sales dip 20%?” and “What happens if the price of coffee beans goes up 50%?”  Inputs for coffee, like beans and dairy are among the most volatile commodities and small swings in price can make a 10% net disappear quickly.\n\nYou’d have to look for existential threats.  Is there a large development coming that will kill your foot traffic for nine months?  Is a major employer leaving the area?  Is office space vacancy climbing in the area?  Is the lease on the space ending any time soon?  Is the rent going up any time soon?  Are you on a bus route that is being rerouted?  Have health inspection reports been poor and the next failure brings a shutdown order?  Is there a new competitor opening up down the block?  Coffee shops don’t die from bad coffee, they die from lease failure, labour failure, and sudden loss of foot traffic.\n\nUltimately, buying a coffee shop is a lifestyle business; you are buying a job.  So if your current wage plus $30K or so a year in additional income makes that job attractive enough, it sounds like a solid buy.\n\nYou will want to ask for financial statements and evaluate all obligations like equipment leases.  It is not uncommon for a business like this to have basically no assets.  It is also not uncommon to owe a bunch to suppliers.  Income statement should show bottom line income and balance sheet should show asset values and any debts.  You are going to want to verify those financial statements against the businesses tax returns.  That will keep you from being duped.\n\nAs additional due diligence, you should have a lawyer review all commercial agreements, like lease, Starbucks, etc to ensure no concerns.  You’ll also want to make sure the deal is structured right given the entities involved.  Are you buying shares, are those shares unencumbered, is there tax liability that might survive the sale and fall on you, etc.\n\nAlso, any letter or offer should specify a working capital calculation method and amount.  Very simply, it is usually something like “Price is $75K and includes $10k or working capital. Working capital is calculated as bank accounts plus inventory plus prepaid expenses plus receivables minus accounts payable, minus accrued expenses minus accrued payroll minus accrued taxes”.  This protects you, the buyer, from any actions the seller might take to weaken your economic position.  Common things they can do: slow paying of bulls to increase accounts payable, deplete inventory, call in all outstanding receivables, clear out the bank accounts, process refunds in unsettled credit card transactions, etc.\n\nCash                = $8,000\nInventory           = $12,000\nPayables            = $6,000\nAccrued Wages/Tax   = $4,000\n\nWorkingCapital = (8,000 + 12,000) − (6,000 + 4,000)\n               = 20,000 − 10,000\n               = $10,000\n\nSo if the owner bleeds the business down to $5K and you have a deal set on a working capital of $10K, you pay $5K less for the business.  This keeps you from having to suddenly come up with another $5k in the first weeks of operation to get the business stable with enough capital to operate day to day.\n\nThe one other thing I would say you should look at with a critical eye is the equipment.  Fridges, espresso machines, etc, can all be very expensive and may be nearing end of life.  You’ll need a capital plan for that and need to make the depreciation of those devices is properly accounted for in the financials.  There would be no worse shock than buying this business making $30K a year and finding out that if the replacement of equipment was properly accounted for, it actually was losing $10K a year and now needs a $50K investment in new equipment that is about to reach end of life.",

If you can legitimately run it for a few years and then afford to hire someone to run it for you because the loan is paid and you have a stream of income that is worth considering. But to take a full-time job as a tiny coffee shop in a cafeteria is not a dream to aspire to, it's survival on a basic level.. So if it's useful to you as a stepping stone then maybe. This could be way more of a trap than an opportunity.\n\nWhat if you invest 3 years of your life and then there is a downturn or something that demands you work longer hours and cannot afford to pay anybody else. Now you are literally trapped. That means that every day working there is a day further away from your dreams. \n\nPure speculation but I believe bad business decisions, and going out of business is a lengthy process that takes away several years of a person's life. It's not like it happens in one decision on one day.  Things generally dwindle along for years with uncertainty before people pull the plug.\n\nIf it were me I would explore options to reset my mental framework. For example I would look for another opportunity to start the business in another location. And run through the numbers and then compare the two. Obviously that's a bit much for you at the stage but that is the very first thing that I would do. Then you have a mental comparison to evaluate it as an opportunity or not. When you have nothing, everything looks like an opportunity. When you have success, everything looks like a possible threat to your success.\n\nThe other thing is friendships do not hold water when it comes to money. People will do absolutely anything for money. To the words lie cheat and steal mean anything to you? Don't trust this person. Verify.\n\nI had a friend who was a young woman a number of years ago. She worked at a jewelry store and started dating the owner. He told her she needed to build up her credit and had her get about $60,000 worth of credit cards with which he bought inventory for the store. He never paid her back and destroyed her credit and completely screwed her over. She was like 22 at the time. So just don't trust anyone.\n\nOne of the first things I would do is investigate this guy's decision but that's going to be hard for you to do without business experience. I could have a 5-minute conversation with him and know exactly what's going on based on his responses as being seemingly true or false. That's hard for you to do. But that is your number one objective is true understanding of his motivation. One way that you can do that as a subordinate is to appeal to him with Emotion by having a saying you want to have a sit-down conversation and you've been thinking a lot about it but you're having a lot of concerns about getting trapped and having your life path misdirected. That will engage his emotions and he may reveal further details to you.\n\nI'll give you an example. When I was younger and buying inexpensive cars for transportation, after a complete inspection and review I would always ask one final question. I would say \"look I plan to get in this car and drive it across the country. If I was going to invest $1,000 what are the top three things you would consider spending it on for repairs?\" They would always always exhale deeply, think for a few moments, and then tell me the exact real actual problems the car had.\n\nSo you might say something like look I need this job to support my mother, or I want to have a family Within 3 years and I needed to support me. And then just see if you sense any emotional waffling from him.",

These are huge to cross-checking the claims - and is the soul of the deal. (Please get a CPA to review with you)\n\n• Verify liability exposure (lease, debt, outstanding invoices). The documents above should cover this, but so many small businesses mismanage these. This is typically what will make or break a deal. \n\n• Try and negotiate down. If 65k was his first price, I’m sure there’s room for a sweeter deal.\n\nThere are other steps you should take, but these are the main 3 for a deal like this.\n\nAnyone who tells you to run away without even checking is foolish. You know the business first hand, it’s a relatively straightforward operation, and the price is pretty amazing.\n\nThe main question(s) for you to answer:\n• Are there any deal breakers that are influencing the price? (Typically hidden liabilities)\n\n• Can I see myself managing this for the foreseeable future and be adequately happy? \n\n• What growth opportunities are there to optimize the top-line &amp; bottom-line &amp; are is that juice worth the squeeze.\n\nThis is a trend across America right now.

You need to do some due diligence. For example, some businesses took out adjustable APR loans during the pandemic that are now coming due... you need to see what kind of debt liability, if any, this business has and if it's assumable upon purchase. For example, I have a business local to me that did this, confident on growth projections, that is now completely underwater and desperate to sell. You don't want to be on the hook for a gamble/loss situation. \n\n\n\nAfter you do the financial due diligence, you'll want to consider the lease terms, if they are assumable and, if so, how long is left. What kind of increases are permitted, etc. If you get to this point, I'd strongly recommend hiring a lease attorney to negotiate caps (usually on annual percentage increases and CAM fees) for you. This would depend, of course, on if the lease is attached to the seller personally or his business, among other things. \n\n\nIf the business has some sort of agreement with Starbucks, you also need to determine what type of contract is in place for that, how much it is, and how long it is for. \n\nFirst thing first, though, get your hands on his Financials. \n\n\nETA: a fair asking price for most businesses is 4-5xs EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization). Seeing his P&amp;L and balance sheet will tell you if his asking price is fair. Doesn't mean you can't haggle or negotiate down, though. The low asking price is a bit of a red flag for me personally, but it could genuinely be that he is desperate for cash. \n\n\nAlso check out your local SBDC branch, as they often offer free business advising services. You could sit down with an advisor and have them walk you through next sets. ",

You probably don't even need the name and location of the businesses if they'll give you the figures \"blind\" and offer to tell you more if you're interested.\n\nThis will educate you *a lot* as to what the market expectations are like for various levels of revenue, rent etc. If after looking at twenty coffee shops for sale yours looks like a bargain (25% or more less than expected price), find a way to make it happen. Vendor finance, silent partner investor, wife's uncle, whatever.\n\nIf it doesn't, maybe you're better off to buy another coffee shop for $40,000 that's being badly run. In hospitality among the best businesses to look for are the ones that are dirty and run-down in appearance (because you can clean up) and that are being run by an asshole (because you can be nice to customers) and are *still* making a small profit because the rent is low and the position is such that customers have little other choice than to go there. And make sure the equipment is reasonably good. Those factors together are a huge green flag. (WARNING: the asshole may be selling because they have heard a competitor is opening up. If there are already multiple competitors, this issue is probably a lot less important.)\n\nAnother option here, if the business is good (let's say worth $100K at market rate) but you personally can't come up with the money, is you offer to help the current owner sell it. You agree to stay on, work on increasing the value of the business enough to cover a broker's commission and lawyers' fees etc (figure maybe $10,000) and then when it's sold anything over $65,000 you keep, and you stay on as an employee of the new owner or go buy your own shop.",

That effort shows, and it creates a sense of engagement and respect between writer and reader. AI-generated text lacks that investment. \n\nIt is empty of personal insight, absent of the human touch, and ultimately a shortcut that shifts responsibility onto anyone who interacts with it.

What budget range are you working with? Sometimes I can adjust the scope to fit.\"\n\n Then I offer a smaller version. Same rate, less scope.\n\n **Objection: \"Can you do it for $X?\"**\n\n Old me: Awkward silence, then \"...sure\"\n\n New me: \"I can definitely work within that budget. At $X, I'd recommend we focus on \\[specific piece\\]. You'd get \\[outcome\\] without the \\[removed elements\\]. Would that work?\"\n\n **Objection: \"We got a lower quote from someone else\"**\n\n Old me: Panic\n\n New me: \"That makes sense — there's a wide range. Does their quote include \\[specific thing\\]? What's their revision policy?\"\n\n Then: \"I'm confident in my pricing because \\[one sentence on value\\]. But if they're a better fit for your budget, I completely understand.\"\n\n **The principle: Never lower your rate. Adjust scope instead.**\n\n It took me years to internalize this. The first few times feel uncomfortable. But once you do it, you stop resenting projects and clients stop expecting discounts.\n\n Anyone else have scripts that work for them?",

Lol\nThere is no negotiation! \n\nIt's like going to walmart. It's not a flea market or garage sale so if the item is $59, you pay $59 for it or you don't buy it. \n\nThis is what people will end up getting if they are the ones trying to be smart, funny, entitled etc about a discount BUT the ones who I feel are sincere and just really had no idea it was going to cost that much money I have no problem  working with and often I give quite a considerable discount just because the people did the opposite of brushing me the wrong way. \n\nPeople that brush me the wrong way will get no discount and I don't even want them for a customer so I will send them on their way as quickly as possible.",

They don't really want the product but rather htan say it they'll just make something up(i do it all the time)\n\n  \na lot of people hate conflict. We can sometimes 'exploit' that but I've learned the customers who aren't interested and just are making up excuses aren't the best clients to have long term\n\n  \nthat doesnt' mean we shouldn't try to salvage deals and sometimes it may be a budget issue but normally if someone is interested in the product/service but the price is too high, they'll try to negotiate or say...can you do any better with the price?\n\n  \nin sales some are better at manipulating someones emotions than others. I'm not even really criticizing that. They work to make someone feel guilt over not buying. Years ago my father went on a sales call with someone who actually took out their family picture and said something like, 'do you want my family to starve? I know the product we are selling will work for you so just sign here so I can buy groceries'. \n\n  \nMy father wasn't all that comfortable in that situation but the salesperson he was with was a top producer.\n\n  \nmy point is a lot depend on if they really are oncerned about price or if they are jsut trying to find a way to say no politely . \n\nI see this more when I'm trying to sell an existing client something new. I have a relationship with them and maybe I'm trying to get them to spend some money. They act interested(maybe because we have built a relatinship over the years) but they'll try to find an excuse on why they aren't able to buy without making it personal. I don't guilt them over it\n\n  \nand when it comes to new prospects, I can typically tell fairly quickly if their expectations are set properly. I don't really work off a script so much but do know what to say in certain situations to try to find a way to close the deal. Maybe I should apply more pressure at times but my experience has been that when I really try too hard to close a deal where the customer isn't sure, they tend to be the ones I might have the most trouble with because if they feel a little pressured to buy, they will be more eager to find problems",

After a very cool and open start to the contract the office manager suddenly went real cold. After 4 weeks of no feedback (we have many channels in place) she abruptly canceled the contract on 24 hour notice. I'm like shaking with anger because we have busted our ass and complied with every bit of feedback. Like if our communication history was shown in a court of public opinion i genuinely feel our team would obviously be sided with.  If anyone is willing to read through the whole situation I have it typed out. I'm just so disappointed. I was gearing up to go full time into the business before this.

There are all types and various levels of expectations WRT services - and many are unspoken.\n\nI agree with other postings - minimum cancelation structure in contracts.  But be prepared to not enforce all contract requirements.  As example, customer can say you did not fulfill one part of a contract, and that's the reason they are canceling without notice....are you really going to sue every time over that?\n\nBetter, and sometimes difficult as hell, is to figure out your customers true expectations, not just what's in the contract.  As (negative) example:  If you go to a restaurant and order a chicken sandwich w/o mayo, and they bring you a burger, then you complain and they quickly and nicely replace with a chicken sandwich with mayo, then you complain again and they quickly and nicely bring the correct order.  Restaurants initial perspective is they did supply what was requested in a responsive to feedback and professional manner....but the customer likely sees that situation as a failure (took too many tries to eventually fix).",

          "body": "Man, I’m really sorry to hear that. Losing a big client like that can feel like a punch to the gut, especially when you’ve invested so much effort. It might be worth reaching out one more time to the office manager, just to get some closure or feedback on what went wrong. Sometimes, clients don’t realize the impact of their decisions, and a conversation might provide you with insights for the future.\n\nAlso, consider diversifying your client base if you haven’t already. Relying heavily on one contract can be risky. For tracking your projects and performance, I've found tools like [Personnn.com](http://Personnn.com) to be helpful for real-time analytics, which can guide your decision-making and improve communication with clients.

Solo realizar \"operaciones estratégicas\" cuando ya se dispone de economía de escala.\n\nTodo esto y mucho más lo he aprendido a base de experimentarlo.",

We both wake up around 4:30–5am,  leave the house around 7am, and the days don’t really stop until late at night. He’s still a technician in the field managing service calls and two techs. I handle everything else: phones, scheduling, billing, payroll, marketing, reviews, follow-ups, permits, subcontractors, networking, thank-you letters, etc.\n\nOn top of that, we have a blended family with rotating custody schedules, a toddler we co-sleep with (unfortunately), pets, and a household that I largely manage. I do the grocery shopping, cooking, laundry, homework, bedtime routines, appointments, and most of the mental load. We do have a house cleaner twice a month and someone who mows the lawn during the summer season, but day-to-day life still feels relentless.\n\nLately, I feel completely invisible.\n\nWhen my husband comes home, he checks out and doom scrolls on his phone while I scramble to get dinner, manage kids, clean up, and try to keep everything afloat. Tonight, during an argument, he asked me what I even do all day because he doesn’t understand why I don’t have time to move money between business accounts. That comment broke something in me.\n\nWe barely touch anymore. We co-sleep with our toddler, and the little intimacy that we do have feels rushed and more about his needs than connection. I don’t get compliments. I don’t feel desired. I’ve asked to be told I’m beautiful, and it just doesn’t happen. I put effort into showing I care, but I don’t feel it reciprocated.\n\nHe says he’s tired. I am too, but I still show up for him.\n\nWe argue more than we connect. I’m scared we’re going to lose our marriage trying to build this business. I feel lonely even when he’s in the house. Tonight he chose to sleep downstairs, even though we had the opportunity to be close, and that made it hurt worse.\n\nMy spark feels gone. I don’t feel seen, valued, or appreciated - as a partner, a woman, or a person. I don’t know if this is burnout, resentment, or the beginning of the end.\n\nIf you’ve built a business with your spouse:  \n• How did you divide labor without resentment?  \n• How did you reconnect emotionally?  \n• How did you stop feeling like roommates or coworkers?  \n• Or how did you know it was time to make a bigger change?\n\nI’m open to hard truths. I just don’t want to feel this alone anymore.",

Be direct with your husband: \"this isn't sustainable, and we're at risk of losing both our company and this marriage\". But, at that point, give him space to ponder things while you try to balance your spinning plates until the block of time arrives.\n\nThen, start with \"I love you\", and \"this isn't working for me, but I want to find a way to make it work for both of us\".\n\nMaybe you need a nanny/helper at the house. Maybe you need an employee to assist with the office operations. Maybe you need another senior tech in the field. I don't know. It's not my place. But, clearly, there's not enough time in the day for everything, so it's time to get creative on what can buy you time. Including buying time together. You both figured out how to get this all going, I'm confident you can work there's and figure out how to make it work better.\n\nOh, and couples therapy might help.

          "body": "Honestly, we realized that our marriage was more important than the business and one of us exited.\n\nIt’s easy to think that if you are partners in life, why not in business? In reality, it is a very rare couple that works well together. I mean, exceedingly rare. I have seen a lot more couples divorce after embarking on a joint venture than sustain it for years. \n\nHow is the business structured? Do you have a well defined role or are you just “helping out”? Do you get a paycheck? Because handling admin for a service based business is no small task. And if he doesn’t appreciate the work you put in, perhaps he should try hiring someone else to do the job. Then he’ll find out that no employee wants to regularly put in 12 hour days “because they care about the business”. They don’t care. After he runs through 3-5 of them, maybe he’ll have a different perspective on things.\n\nBottom line, takes a toll on your marriage. We tried to figure out a way to make it work for years but it was breaking me to have to manage my spouse. If there was tension at home it came to work, and vice versa. Our marriage still hasn’t really recovered and we were in a similar position, co-sleeping toddler too, when we started working together. Thankfully our child is older now but it was rough going for awhile there. You do lose yourself and that connection because you are just getting through the days. \n\nMy best advice would be to define everything about your role down to the last detail, look at a typical salary for your area for that type of position, and show him those numbers. It’s too easy to take someone for granted when the work they do isn’t quantified. But also, consider that a vast majority of couples do not work together or even work in related fields and there’s a reason for that. That much overlap creates friction and it’s not anyone’s fault, it’s the nature of the beast. Once I let go of the idea that we “should” be able to make it work it became much easier to look at the situation objectively.",

That’s a nearly impossible situation. Working like that drains everything out of you and there’s just nothing left in the tank for intimacy or connection. \n\nI highly recommend that if this is what you guys need to do, and you’re making enough money, make sure you can get away for a night or two at least once a month, and at least one other date night or two each month. Getting out of that day-to-day situation is the only way you’re going to connect. Recently, my wife and I started trying to do a staycation / Airbnb once every two months let’s say.

Or maybe he’s mad that his team lost last Sunday.\n\nEither way it may be worth investigating his stressors without commenting on them. Think about what he said is stressing him for a week before doing or saying anything about it and go from there.\n\nThis will allow you to bring up your own stress and tackle like a team issue where you find a way to eliminate 1 thing from each other’s list at a time.\n\nOr… I’m spouting nonsense.

Reconnect emotionally is simple but not easy.  You just need to have fun together.  Find ways to laugh together.  That’s a Herculean task when you have businesses and living.  A lot of people like to recommend couples counseling, but with business owners that just becomes another task and rarely works.\n\n3.  Start touching each other.  Every opportunity to hold hands, grab butts, pick lint, bump into each other, get in each others path.\n\n4.  If you are unsatisfied then it is always time to make a big change, but make sure the juice is worth the squeeze.  If you are miserable now at 40 and you do nothing, do you think at 45 things will be better?  You think you are bitter and resentful now, do the same thing for 5 more years.",

          "body": "I feel you. I’m replying as someone who is inside a business-and-marriage like this, not commenting from the outside. One of the biggest shifts we made was realising that the home is another business. If we tried to run it like a “normal household” on top of running an actual company, we would have burned out completely.\n\nSo we outsource as much as we realistically can:\n\t•\tcleaning\n\t•\tlaundry / ironing\n\t•\tfood shopping\n\t•\tmeal prep where possible\n\t•\tlawn and outside jobs\n\t•\tsome personal admin\n\nNot because we’re lazy but because our time and energy are better spent on high-value tasks: in the business, in the relationship, and with our children.\n\nWe did the same inside the business. We invested early in admin and office support because growth (and sanity) required it. Trying to do everything yourself is a fast track to resentment.\n\nThat said — even with help, we’re still exhausted at times. This isn’t a magic fix.\n\nWe also have young children, and when I’m at home I want to be present with them. Not half-working, half-scrolling, half-thinking about what I forgot to do. I still don’t get the balance right but outsourcing the background noise of life gives us a fighting chance.\n\nWhat’s mattered just as much as practical help is alignment.\n\nWe regularly check in on:\n\t•\tAre we on the same page about where the business is going?\n\t•\tDo we agree on why we’re pushing this hard?\n\t•\tAre we both choosing this  — or is one of us just enduring it?\n\nWe take a full day once a quarter to map everything out — business, home, pressure points, capacity. It’s not romantic, but it stops silent resentment building.\n\nWe also talk openly about the pitfalls. Work will take over if you let it. So we’re very intentional about:\n\t•\tno-work-talk moments\n\t•\tno-phone time\n\t•\tactually being present with each other, even when we’re shattered\n\nWe co-sleep too, and I won’t pretend our relationship is top priority all the time. Sometimes it genuinely isn’t. This life isn’t rainbows and butterflies.\n\nBut we make a conscious effort to keep showing up imperfectly, but intentionally. We want to be successful and we want our relationship to survive this season.\n\nSo the question I’d ask: \n\nAre you aligned on where you’re going, why you’re doing this, and what support you’re allowed to bring in without guilt?\n\nIf the structure doesn’t change, the feeling you’re describing won’t go away — it will just harden. That doesn’t mean your marriage is failing. It means the system around you is overloaded.\n\nYou’re not invisible.\nYou’re not asking for too much.\nYou’re just carrying too much without enough support around you.\n\nAnd you’re definitely not alone x",

Some of them were natural phases of marriage that I think come along with raising children and being in a relationship for a long time. And I truly think we would have had most of those same struggles regardless of our careers. \n\nIn the business we have had gone through periods (like when our kids were young) that I took much more of a backseat and really limited my involvement as I focused more on the household. And then the pendulum has swung and now that our kids our school aged, my husband manages much more of the household (picking up kids from school, packing lunches, making dinner, etc), while I have gotten to step back in and be more of the point person and expert at work. It has been a really nice shift for both of us to have some role reversal and appreciation for what the other one contributes. \n\nSo although we struggle with all of the exact things you mention,  I think so much of this is a relationship problem. Running a business together can magnify these issues, but they would be there even if you had separate jobs. \n\nHaving a partner who can help share in not only the physical tasks, but also in the mental workload is huge. And although I am sure he is navigating his own burnout and struggles, from your side of things, it really sounds like he is dropping the ball, and the current situation is not sustainable. There is some great suggestions in here on the needed conversations. If your husband is willing to listen and work together to help make some adjustments, I think there is a great opportunity to help you both reconnect, prevent burnout, and improve. You deserve a partner in business AND life who appreciates you and joins along side you.",

You say you’re both busy and somewhat successful, but still feel like you’re constantly trying not to fall behind. That’s a classic trap for service business owners who haven’t raised prices enough to create the margin needed to hire help, systematize, and buy back time.\n\nNot trying to sell you anything — even though, yeah, this would be an easy pitch and maybe I’m off, but let me ask this…\n\nWhen’s the last time you and your husband actually sat down and talked strategy? Not just surviving the week, but real conversations like:\nHow can we be more efficient?\nWhat can we simplify or delegate?\nWhat level of growth would let us both work fewer hours and actually have time for each other?\n\nBecause without those talks, it’s really easy to stay stuck in survival mode — busy, tired, and slowly drifting further apart instead of building something that creates freedom.\n\nI learned this the hard way. My wife worked in the medical field and wasn’t involved in my business, but I tried to include her in my plans for growth and what that could mean for our future. She wasn’t interested, and over time she resented how much I worked. Back then I wasn’t making much, but we paid the bills, ate out sometimes, and took small trips.\n\nWe’re divorced now. She’s still in the same career and as dar as i know enjoys what she does. I went through years of struggle as an entrepreneur, but I never stopped having those strategy conversations — even when it was just me. The company that once barely made $75k a year was recently evaluated at ~$5M, and I’m pushing for eight figures next.\n\nThis isn’t about saying I’m worth more than my ex. It’s about showing how critical intentional planning is and the cost not being can have on a marriage. You rarely know exactly how you’ll get where you want to go, but if you’re not talking about it, defining it, and working toward it together, you stay stuck.\n\nAnd staying stuck too long turns into bitterness. Bitterness becomes resentment. And resentment eventually shows up as behaviors that damage both the business and the relationship.",

The world would still go around even if you dropped everything right now. You won't lose your house over it.\n\nYou first have to figure out which parts of the job you absolutely hate, and which are alright. The parts you hate have to be delegated as much as possible. If you hate putting in the receipts onto the accounting system, in an extreme sense pay a local kid $40 to spend 2 hours manually typing everything in every month. If you think \"that's expensive\", how much will YOU need to be paid for you to happily do the same job for someone else?\n\nNext, there are a few tasks there that won't hurt you even if you let it go completely. You can let go of social media and review responses. The largest sticking point of a client base is usually having a reasonable job done and any aftercare if a problem arises. They don't care if your Email response is 3 hours late. They don't care how you respond to their 5 star review. The business won't die.\n\nYour husband needs to delegate some tasks too, and reduce his workload. Did you know that rejecting some jobs \"because you are overbooked\" doesn't hurt your business? It simply makes you look popular. Alternatively, raising prices until some clients move away.\n\n\nFinally, discussing family time. Never Split The Difference has good negotiation tactics to get your feelings heard. \n\nThe problem with his \"Why can't you do this, what do you do all day?\" Is that he refuses to see labour he considers free/profit-less. If moving money is that easy, why won't he do it himself? It's because there's mental workload involved. It hurts you because you are drowning with tasks that he admits that it's impossible for him to do.\n\nYou both need more free time to open up the emotional capacity. Remember, you are not doing work he won't do, you are doing work he can't, and you are allowed to switch the off button. Discuss with him that the business will be shut down before the marriage ends, and you're going to save the marriage first.

He also though steps in ALOT and loves doing things for me… he’s always insisting on doing the dishes after dinner, never complains when I don’t feel like cooking, he’s super clean and organized as am I but we don’t have set roles. I do mainly cook dinner but since I’ve been tired due to pregnancy, he’s stepped up and made some great meals even after a hard day.\n\n• How did you stop feeling like roommates or coworkers?\nYou need to designate a weekend date night, make chores fun, even food shopping we love going together, get a babysitter and go out for a few hours just you 2. We don’t have much family here but thankfully my mother is nearby so alot of the time we even drop our dog off to her on Fri night and go out have fun and grab him the next morning and we will be doing that with our child as well. I’m sure there will be harder seasons for sure but maybe also try getting your kid out of the bed in the future so it’s just u guys again? \n\n• Or how did you know it was time to make a bigger change? If we’re out walking the dog we will catch up briefly on work cuz he’s on site all day so for me I call him for a 3 min convo or when he goes to store runs he always calls to catch up and see how my days going.

But we were in a highly stressful industry, and at the stage that we either expanded or shut down (not by choice, but post-covid market dictated that we grow or we close). Plus, just like you, we have a toddler.\n\nWe chose family. We'd scale down if we could, but scale down is not an option, we can't survive with our profit margin. So we sold everything and moved on.\n\nFrom your comments it seems like your business is going through a growing pain. And as important as he thinks the technical part is, without properly handling the admin side of business, the company would just run itself to the ground. He has a choice to either:\n- dip in with house work (like he's supposed to do anyway, it's his house too, not just yours!) so you can focus on training the new girl,\n- or you raise your price, scale everything down, less client and less admin work. Probably still the same money.\n\nIf he doesn't like either, then the only logical way to keep the marriage is to dissolve the company, and you both work somewhere else separately. But make sure he understands it's HIS choice, you're supporting whatever decision he makes.\n\nPersonally, I'd definitely prefer to increase my rate. I'm still pissed off because I couldn't do it in our business, the price sensitivity is real pain in ours.\n\nAnd couple therapy if you can.

He probably sees you, and feels he isn't performing even though you have probably never said anything about it and thinks he is doing fine.\n\nWith the pressure of the businesses pushing so hard on all of you, it is time to hire administrative staff to take off the load.  Trying to do it all and take care of family is too much pressure long term which both of you are seeing and feeling.\n\nI would heavily recommend hiring a manager to help take care of the day to day to include the duties you have been doing this whole time and add in guardrails e.g., requirement to sign for purchases/expenses over x amount.  For your husband it is time for him to step back or the pressure will literally put him in the hospital.  He needs to downgrade to just doing initial training, and administrative duties so he can actually enjoy life as the time lost just working makes this a job and not an actual business.  Fine if it was just him and this was just starting up, but that time has come and gone. Both of you will need to learn to delegate or it will mess both of you up mentally and physically.  If this means hiring new employees make it happen so you can both get your time back.\n\nAt the end of the day family needs to come first, no point just running a business without being able to spend reasonable time with family.  When we overdue putting in too much into the business without properly learning to delegate turns things in the wrong direction as both of you are seeing now.\n\nHave a talk with him and get the delegating done or reduce the service calls to help get both yours time to enjoy life back in order.",

I'm the business/e-commerce/customer side, he's the manufacturing side. First, I felt totally burned out (our son was 4-5 at that time). Too much to do, not enough time, nothing was done as well as it needed to be. I decided to do a hard inventory of our business (I went to a hotel for a weekend alone and put up pieces of paper on the wall and wrote all my ideas, etc). Here's what we did:\n\n\\- I focused on two overarching principles: less work but same output (systems and equipment), and \"outsource that sh\\*\\*\"). I started making a list of every single task I handled, as well as the frequency (like \"run payroll, every 2 weeks on Friday\"). I sorted it in two different ways: one was \"time-suck\" - put the most time-consuming items at the top and go down the list. Second one was: what do I absolutely hate doing.\n\n\\-From there I worked systematically through the list. Examples of my time-sucks were: 1) customers calling and rather than asking a directed question, which I could answer in 5 minutes of my time, they would chat and chat and tell me all sorts of issues with their entire project rather than MY part of the project. 2) manually entering all orders into the system and following it through the order workflow.",

We're married and part of the entire reason we got married is because we work better together than apart. I'm good at certain aspects of the business while he's good at other aspects. Marriage, and business partnership, is all about harmony. You come together to create something bigger than just the two of you. The moment you start keeping score at all, is the moment you stop being a relationship. Sometimes I really cannot be bothered to do the dishes especially after a long day, and vice versa. You know what we do? We thanklessly and silently fill in each others gaps. He'll cover for dishes if I'm tired and sometimes I'll cover, even though the goal is always a balance that feels \"right\". Both of us care a lot about trying to do our fair share as an innate quality of our character. Sometimes we're both exhausted and the dishes pile up, sometimes I end up doing laundry for a month straight. And you know what? That's ok - what important is that it gets done eventually and we are on each other's team to handle whatever life throws our way. \n\nStop keeping score (and he needs to as well).\n\n&gt; How did you reconnect emotionally?\n\nWe do things for each other all the time. We also go on dates. I don't need to reconnect because I never lost connection. This is a lot easier to if you're not burnt out, which you are because you're working 2-3x more than you should be working. If you can't cut your current working hours in half, you don't have a sustainable business and **that** needs fixed first thing. Hire/outsource, start being smart about your business acumen, stop grinding. If you're grinding and it isn't your first year in business you're doing something wrong and there's further optimizing to be done. Business isn't only about making the numbers grow big forever - you can decide for yourself what success means. It's ok to make less money to have a better work life balance despite what wall street and the money gambling addicted billionaire class wants you to believe.\n\n&gt; How did you stop feeling like roommates or coworkers?\n\nSee above.

The bottlenecks in your business are usually the things you’re lacking as a person.\n\nWhat I was actually avoiding was obvious. I didn’t like talking to people.\n\nI avoided sales calls. Tried to close deals over text. Then gradually went cold when someone wanted a call. I was literally letting go of opportunities.\n\nI was distracting myself with 1% improvements while avoiding what was probably a 400% business growth at that point.\n\n\nI didn’t magically fix it, but this is how I deal with it now:\n\n1. I only work with big high-ticket clients, so the earnings per talking ratio would be optimal.\n\n2. Brought on a sales rep.\n\n3. Reduced impostor syndrome by becoming more of an expert. So that people can’t corner me by asking something I don’t know.\n\n\nHope this helps a fellow introvert out there :)\n",

Payroll is in one place, employee stuff is somewhere else, and when tax time rolls around I’m digging through different dashboards trying to find the right reports. Last year was a scramble and I’m trying not to repeat that.\n\nAlso, every now and then we pay people outside the US (contractors/vendors), and that turns into another separate process on top of payroll.\n\nI’ve been looking at options and they all say the same things on their websites. We don’t need anything fancy. I just want something that runs payroll without drama and makes end of year less of a mess.\n\nIf you’re doing payroll for a small team, what are you using and would you pick it again?

We are good and knowledgeable at what we do. I believe we are around 1 of 6 shops in our State that can offer the level of expertise and service that we do. \n\nWe did a repair back around Thanksgiving. Normally, the customer picks up their own items. However, this customer lives around 30 minutes away and is in her 70's so we offered to deliver it free of charge as we had another stop in that direction. Normally a house call to her area is $175.\n\nShe has contacted us twice to come back out to her home. We went both times free of charge and both times found nothing wrong. She was not taking care of the item in the proper manner and we advised her of that. We did not charge her for the stops, again we tried to toggle them on existing stops in that  area.\n\nToday she calls and is irate. She is screaming how she paid $450 and the item was not functioning correctly and she was insulted we suggested she was not fully understanding how to take care of it. She additionally started the conversation with \"don't make me take you to small claims court.\" I point out that she has a year warranty and that we generally never go to the customer's home, we did so prior to be helpful...no one is refusing to honor her warranty or assist. I advised that customers generally bring their item back to the shop if they are having issues and we can re-test, re-examine. She carried on she was not driving 30 minutes to the shop and I explained we have customers driving 3 hours to bring things to us. \n\nThis went on for a good 5 or more minutes of her making insults (ie, \"other shops could do a better job\" or \"you people don't know what you are doing\") before I simply said we are done for today, the options are to bring it to the shop or wait until we are in your area which may be a week or two. I advised her threatening, talking aggressively, or making insults is not going to engage us or encourage us to respond or help any faster. As we went to hang up I heard her say \"you bitch.\" \n\nI immediately called her back and informed her that I heard her comment. I told her she was no longer welcome to call our business. I told her I was not going to put up with her hostile and now verbally abusive behavior over something so trivial. I suggested she find another shop to help her (BTW, there is not one for at least 90 minutes). \n\nHave you had similar encounters and how did you handle them? \n\nAny thoughts on how the warranty is handled if you are no longer willing to see the customer due to their behavior?\n\nAs a small business, my other partner said \"great, now we just have to wait for the negative review.\" But my position is, why do we as a small business have to tolerate piss poor behavior from customers, why is it wrong to put your foot down and say \"no more, we are done\".....",

I’m polite and explain to them what we’re seeing and demonstrate proper care. But when a customer blows up on me like that, which luckily has been rare, they get fired. In most of those situations I refund them their money, it’s not worth the headache. Yeah I lose revenue, but the I look at it as paying for better mental health. I also blacklist them on our appointment scheduler so they can’t bring in any other instruments In the future. One of the other things I do is make sure every customer gets a follow up email encouraging them to leave a Google review. This has resulted in hundreds of 5-star reviews for us. The few bad reviews I’ve gotten I respond to directly, and put in a dispute with Google. Between the huge amount of 5-star reviews and a thorough reply to a bad review Google will usually pull the negative review down.

But there's high demand for what I do, so basically I have as much work as I want and more than I can realistically take on in short order. \n\nBut no matter how clear that is and should be, some people are very very adamant about being priority A and setting their own policies rather than following mine. \n\nIn this case, around this time last year I dealt with a person much like yours.  I have a housecall charge and the rest is paid when I return to complete the work. This customer demanded he pay me in full to the point where he refused to even give me his card until I agreed to.  \n\nSo against my better judgement, that's exactly what I did.  I went to schedule his next visit and he told me \"no hurry\" and that it would be okay if it was later on.  And the day that I wanted to come by had inclemate weather, so I wasn't able to come. \n\nHe called twice the next day - a Sunday, which is a day where I'm closed - and then again Monday morning to yell at me.  He made a big point of how he'd already paid me and how I wasn't calling him back, so I must be cheating him. \n\nI called him back, noted the weather, his own statements and business hours and he calmed down.  I noted that I'd contact him back with some scheduling options as quickly as I could. \n\nAnd I did. But he did not respond. So I did not schedule him and focused on the customers who... called me back and stuff. \n\nThen he came back around, yelling at me for \"forgetting about him\" and pointing out again how he'd already paid me.  I noted that he was unresponsive to my messages about scheduling and he blew that off, stating I could come \"at any time I was free\"\n\nI noted how I'm never \"free\" and my policy is to set a hard schedule. So we did.  But then a winter storm came that day, too, so I had to cancel it.  He said he understood.  I offered him more scheduling slots and he wanted to know why I didn't just come on by.  I had to re-iterate myself. \n\nThis went on for a few weeks. I'd call.  No answer.  I'd offer him scheduled time slots via voicemail and text that would go unanswered. Then he'd suddenly call one day to yell at me for not coming.  After all, he'd already paid me. I then tried to force a slot on him and he said it was no good, then ignored more attempts and so on. \n\nThen came the big cuss storm day.  I reiterated everything HE said and did and didn't do and offered him a refund. He refused it, saying he wanted the work done because there's nobody else out here who can do it.  So I call him back, offer time slots via voicemail and again, no response. \n\nThen comes another morning. This time, 16 voicemails at 6am calling me MFer and all that stuff.  So I drafted a kind response to send via text stating that I'd tried all of these things... documenting all the times I tried... all his refusals to follow policy... and added that his reactions no longer allow me to feel safe in his home and therefore, I'm refunding his money and blocking him.\n\nThat way, I had everything documented if he ever went BBB or legal or whatever.  Nothing ever came of it, though. \n\nDo NOT ever let yourself feel bad for putting your foot down.  Drawing a line.

      "selftext": "I’ve been running a handmade business for several years and I love the actual work.\nHowever, a small number of very difficult customers (aggressive messages, ignoring boundaries, constant pressure) has seriously affected my mental health over the yeats.\nI’m at a point where I’m questioning whether continuing is worth the emotional cost, even though the business itself works.\nHas anyone here closed or paused their business mainly because of customer behavior?\nHow did you know it was the right decision — or how did you protect yourself if you stayed?\n\nUpdate:\nI want to add more context because I realize “bad customers” can sound abstract.\nThis hasn’t been about a few rude messages or normal customer service stress. Over many years as a solo handmade business owner, I’ve dealt with a recurring pattern where a small number of customers escalated far beyond normal business interactions.\n\nI’ve experienced insults, verbal abuse, pressure, and threats. When I enforced boundaries or ended business relationships, some customers didn’t disengage — they escalated further. In some cases, they bypassed formal communication channels and used private contact details I never shared, including contacting me outside business hours and sending messages or letters to my private address. That crossed a line from “difficult customers” into something that felt unsafe and deeply distressing.\n\nThe cumulative impact of this has been severe: burnout, anxiety, panic reactions, and a loss of trust and joy in work I once loved. Being the sole person responsible — emotionally, legally, and operationally — meant there was no buffer, no team, no protection layer.\n\nI’m sharing this not to seek validation or business advice, but because talking about it helps me process what happened. Stepping back is not about weakness or giving up — it’s about protecting my mental health after years of repeated boundary violations.\nIf you’ve experienced something similar as a solo founder or creative business owner, you’re not alone. Sometimes the healthiest decision isn’t optimization — it’s distance.",

I had a short small mental break around 6 years ago from a particularly nasty review during the height of busy season. That combined with the customers messages just put me over the edge and I had to take a few days off to lower stress levels. \n\nI say all that to mention this: last year I silenced Etsy seller notifications on my phone. No more cha-ching. No more message notifications. \n\nI now only deal with Etsy when I'm logged in my computer and working (granted that's like 8-14 hours given the day, I'm still a sbo). It's made a huge difference in my mental health and being able to truly have a break from customers. \n\nYou can be grateful for success without being available 24/7 to shoppers. I just didn't really know or do that the first 8 years. \n\nMaybe try something similar before throwing in the towel should your business be a lucrative passion.",

My boss said it was ok, that we have done a banker's bone before. So, he agreed to the contract, but here's the thing, he has no idea what a banker's bond is. He just said yes without thinking it through to get the project. We don't qualify for banker's bond and therefore cannot get the deposit. I cannot get the money to buy the materials, and the client will not proceed without a banker's bond. I am really so lost and don't know what to do. I am stuck in limbo. Any advice is appreciated.",

They want their financial institution to prove to your furniture company that they have enough funds in their account to cover the $110,000 to make this purchase. When the bill comes due in full, then the bank releases the money to your business. By not collecting a deposit, your boss has agreed to use company funds to pay for the furniture upfront, instead of using the customer's deposit. Does your boss not have enough capital to accomplish the purchase order?  That has nothing to do with securing the bond though, that should have been done with your customer's bank at the same time the contract was signed. You, or your boss, should have received paperwork from the customer's bank at that time.",

If you don't know why, you won't know what the right thing to do is. \n\nThe first question you have to ask is: is there a market for printing? What do you print? Is there daily demand for prints? From whom? How big is the demand? Who is currently filling that demand? Those are your competitors. \n\nResearch your competitors. Are the local, or are your competitors across the world. If some are local, go to their shops. What printing services do they offer? What are their prices? Do they make a lot of business from walk in customers? Or is it online? Do they have a web presence? How do they advertise themselves? How much do they spend on advertising? How much are total business expenses? How many sales per day? Per month? Is that a lot? For each printing business write detailed notes about the business. You need to do some math and figures out if they are making small profit or big profit. \n\nNow buy a small print service from each. Study how they greet and talk to the customer. Do they suggest other services? Do they suggest a discount for a larger batch of prints. How do they get the design? What are the terms of service? Redo, refunds, etc. \n\nWith this info, now you have to ask the tough questions. Can you offer the same printing services? Is there a way to improve the service to entice customers? If not, then can you decrease prices? Can you offer new services? Do you know where you can find new customers or create a new type of customer? If the traditional customer is businesses, then think about printing stickers, binders, folder, T-shirts, or temporary tattoos for children and parents. Lastly, can you advertise, and find new ways to be seen by your potential customer. \n\nNext ask, Which services bring in the most money? Why? Study that service carefully because you need to be the best and the best price at that service. \n\nNow about you: can you build such a business? Can you do it alone? Do you need to hire someone? Analyse you own business and ask what are all the costs of the business? Is it the printing itself? Or packing and delivery? For your prices, how many sales per month to pay for business expenses, pay taxes, pay for rent utilities, health, vacation, and food, and also have a little extra for the business so you can use it to improve  you services.  Is this a realistic number of sales? Are you getting than many number of sales? If not you need to advertise to your customer base, offer lower prices than your competitors. And you entire goal is to get enough customers for the price of your service. Which means marketing and advertising and finding your competitors customers, and new customers no one is using. \n\nAnyways hope that helps, good luck.",

Printing as a business is still viable, not dying. What is dead is generic, low-margin printing with no clear niche or differentiation.\n\nPrinting is still alive in packaging and labels, signage, business collaterals for SMEs (business cards, brochures, etc), custom and short-run prints, and event, school, or church materials.\n\nI don't wanna question the viability of the printing business. The real questions are: \n- Who are you serving right now?\n-  What specific printing problems do they pay for urgently? \n- Are you competing on price or on speed, reliability, and specialization?\n\nIf you’re open to it, it would help to know what type of printing you do, who your current customers are, and what’s eating up your cash flow the most. \n\nNot sure if it's allowed, maybe you can share your website or anything we can review or audit to somehow help you find clarity and tighter strategy, esp when capital is tight (otherwise, feel free to DM).",
