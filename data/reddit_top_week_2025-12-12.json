      "selftext": "bro idk what kinda clients I’m attracting lately but this one dude seriously broke my brain 😭 like he comes in all normal “hey need a simple landing page” and I’m like bet, that’s chill, quick gig, nothing crazy.  \nthen man drops a google doc on me that legit looks like someone wrote it during an earthquake. random CAPS everywhere, half sentences missing, one line literally said “add something emotional here idk but make them feel stuff.” like bro I’m not a therapist I just build pages 😭\n\nand dude COULD NOT stop calling. every 15-20 mins “quick call?” “2 min sync?” “just checking in?” like sir pls let me do the work you are panicking about. I swear I spent more time dodging his calls than actually designing anything.\n\nthen he starts sending voice notes?? whispering. like legit whispering. “make the button… more urgent…” bruh I felt like I was being recruited into some cult. I had my headphones on and nearly threw them off my head like WHY ARE YOU TALKING LIKE THIS 💀\n\nanyway somehow I finish it. clean up his chaos-doc, build the thing, make it look kinda decent. send it. man replies in 6 seconds flat:  \n“hmm not vibing, can you make it more green”  \nand THAT’S IT. no what part. no why. no screenshot. just “green.” like sir what exactly in your life needs to be green? the button? the whole page? the chakra alignment??\n\nI just sat there staring at the screen like ok yea freelancing actually might not be for me today.\n\nhonestly the only takeaway I got from this mess is: if the client’s first message feels slightly unhinged, that’s not a red flag, that’s literally a trailer. the full movie gets way worse. and next time I’m charging a “confusion tax” upfront bc I’m not doing spiritual-color-therapy landing pages for free again 😭",

People will pay a premium to get their information removed from google search from websites that pop up that are from data collection / broker websites.\n\nThe problem - People's information exist on the internet from data brokers.\n\nSolution - You remove it.\n\nYes this is a subscription service some sites offer, but not all of them remove everything, and not everyone knows about them, nor do they trust them with their data.\n\nBasically I would charge clients to remove their information, and often upsell them for more removals if I found more of their family on the sites. Or I'd get requested from the very beginning to remove multiple family members from these sites + obviously themselves. I would also explain how this information got leaked, and how to prevent it going forward.\n\nCharged 45$ - 65$ per client. Most clients were regular people seeking privacy, but a lot of my clients were wealthier and seeking privacy, some were higher profile like one was a private investigator, others were people who were on a TV show, or in court cases, public spot light. Some were looking to escape an ex, others looking to clean up their online details post getting frauded, etc. Each client on average took about 3 hours ish for the ones with most data logged. I tried to charge roughly 20$ an hour. I found at even 65$ a client people would still pay.\n\nRetired the method because - It got mentally exhausting constantly fighting data broker websites who always evolved to make their website an absolute pain in the ass to opt out of on purpose to prevent opt out's. Or sites who down right refused to remove people, forcing you to contact their website host.\n\nThings I used to run the hustle:\n\nWorking PC + Internet (Obviously) -  \nSpreadsheet of data collection websites -  \nSolid VPN -  \nPrivacy Emails (1 per person) -  \nApps for burner numbers -  \nKnowledge of data collection, and online privacy -  \nThisPersonDoesn'tExist website for ID verification opt outs that were basically 100% not justified in asking for ID. -  \nAbility to craft up cease and desist letters via chat gpt upon client request for stubborn websites. -  \nOther sneaky methods to bypass difficult data collector websites to get a removal -  \n\n\nEach client got a screen shot of every website they were on, displaying what information was shown, and then a confirmed note of removed all compiled into a PDF.\n\nAsk Me Anything!

I had half-finished courses in web development, graphic design, copywriting, SEO, and video editing. Every time I hit a roadblock in one, I’d immediately jump to the next, convincing myself that was the real skill I needed. It was exhausting and expensive.  \n  \nAbout three months ago, I finally forced myself to pick just one specific, marketable skill, in my case, advanced email automation setup for small businesses, and delete all the bookmarks for the other four courses. I focused purely on mastery and building a portfolio for that one thing.  \n  \nThe learning curve was steep, but the focus made it manageable.  \n  \nLast week, I landed my first small freelance gig through a local connection. It was a simple setup, took me about 8 hours total, and I charged $150.  \n  \nWhen the client emailed me saying how much time it saved them and that they’d already recommended me to a colleague, and then I saw that $150 hit my bank account… honestly, it was the most validating feeling I’ve had in years.  \n  \nIt wasn't about the money. It was the proof that focused effort on a single skill can actually translate into real-world value. That feeling of earning something because you solved a specific problem for someone else? Better than any fantasy lottery win.  \n  \nIf you’re stuck in the course-jumping loop, seriously, pick one thing and commit to it until you get that first paid gig. It changes everything.  \n  \nWhat was the one skill you finally committed to that led to your first win? I’m genuinely curious.",

Figured I'd share what I found since most of the content out there is people regurgitating stuff they've never actually tried. The \"start an AI content agency\" advice needs to die. The market is completely flooded. Everyone jumped on this in early 2024 and now you're competing with thousands of people offering the same thing. Same deal with AI-generated art on print-on-demand sites. I tried this for two months and made literally $12. The designs all look the same and the market is buried in AI slop. What's actually worked for me is way less sexy. I started helping local businesses with basic AI stuff — not pitching them on \"AI solutions\" but just helping a dentist's office write better emails or showing a realtor how to speed up their listing descriptions. These people are like two years behind on this stuff and they're happy to pay someone to just figure it out for them. I also make decent money from Notion templates for a specific niche, but that took months to get traction. The uncomfortable part nobody talks about is the timeline. Nothing made real money in month one. It took me until month three or four before I was consistently hitting $300-500. Anyone promising faster results is trying to sell you a course. Curious what's actually working for other people who've moved past the \"I watched a YouTube video\" stage.",

What’s actually working today is unsexy, hyper-specific help for people who are behind on AI.\n\nWhat’s been working for me is using AI as a thinking partner with local professionals. Not selling them “AI solutions,” just helping them make better decisions faster. Example: breaking down a dentist’s patient communication flow, rewriting the scripts with AI, and helping staff use it daily. Small wins, but they pay because it saves them real time.\n\nThe pattern I’m seeing:\n\n1. Pick one profession that’s 2–3 years behind the curves.\n2. Sit with them, watch their workflow.\n3. Use AI to remove 20–30 minutes of pain from a task they repeat all week.\n4. Charge monthly for ongoing support, not one-off projects.\n\nIt’s not flashy. It’s slow for the first couple months. But once one person in that niche gets value, they refer you to others.\n\nCurious what niches others are seeing traction in. The “real work” side of AI is where the money seems to be, not in the trendy stuff.",

It’s literally just a ringing screen. No voice, no conversation, nothing that would fool anyone.\n\nSo, I decided to create an app for myself. It basically triggers an actual phone call that sounds like a real person talking to you.\n\nNow I’m sitting here wondering if this is actually useful to people or if it’s just one of those weird ideas that only makes sense to few people. Just curious if anyone else has had moments where a real-sounding call would’ve helped or if I’m totally overthinking this.\n\nWould love to know if this feels like a real problem people deal with?\n\nP.S: Also I am planning to add a reminder call feature because I have missed lot of work meetings. This feature could call me to remind me that I have a meeting in 5 minutes.",

I’m thinking it’s one of those $5 jobs where they want you to redesign planet earth. but whatever, I take it. turns out this man just wanted a button moved 12 pixels to the left. twelve. PIXELS. bro I’ve spent longer deciding which sock to wear.\n\nso I do it. five minutes. send it. done.  \nguy replies like I just solved world hunger — “OMG PERFECT! you saved my whole launch!! also do you take long-term work?”\n\nand suddenly this tiny stupid 12-pixel job becomes a retainer that literally kept me afloat for months. like?! imagine the universe watching me cry over noodles and going “lol okay give this clown some money before he combusts.”\n\nthe wildest part? that one tiny gig only happened because I didn’t quit that night. didn’t close the laptop. didn’t throw myself into the void. I just stayed online out of pure stubbornness and mild insomnia.\n\nmoral of the story? idk man… sometimes life absolutely bodies you and then tosses you a reward like “here, champ, you survived the tutorial level.” just keep showing up. even if you’re a confused gremlin eating midnight noodles. apparently that’s enough 💀✨",

If you truly have 18 hours a day, that’s a weapon, but only if you pick ONE thing and go deep.\n\nSome realistic paths that don’t need money to start:  \n– Learn a simple service skill (editing, design, automation, outreach) and sell it to people already making money  \n– Learn how to build and sell small digital products (templates, checklists, scripts) around a specific problem  \n– Learn basic AI + workflow tools and help non-technical people use them  \n– Learn content + distribution (how posts actually get attention on Reddit, Twitter, etc.)\n\nThe key isn’t the niche. It’s committing to something for 30–60 days without switching every week. Boredom usually comes from lack of progress, not lack of options. Once you see even a small result, motivation follows fast.",

So the stuff I’m considering is the following:\n\nSMMA: I have experience running social media accounts, my 9-5 is this for an agency but I don’t get much apart from my set wage.\n\nVideo Editing: a skill I’ve built up over the past year. I’m better at doing shorts/reels as opposed to long form yt videos but I want to build up this skill.\n\nUGC: I can make good looking content and I’m happy in front of camera\n\nAppointment setting: I’ve seen a lot of hype about this, but don’t know much about it. \n\nSo, I guess what I’m asking is, which is the most lucrative? Which is the easiest to get clients? Is it feesable to make any of these into my full time gig / make a full time living from these “side” hustles? \n\n",

Its been a roller coaster but we cant get out of this jam. My wife works as a shopper and delivers to customers home. She makes anywhere between 800-1200 a week. Pay for this company has really decreased overtime and she works 5-6 days a week.\n\nI work for a friend who gets the ins on tax refund opportunities for small and big businesses. Section 125 cafeteria plans (not easy to sell and whoever i did sign up only brings me about $500/3 months).\n\nTip tax credit that will only pay in 6-10 weeks (its an irs refund and just takes a little bit for turn around. I have about 29 apps in with 1/4 that don't qualify. Either way, its gonna be a while).\n\nI just got my life/health/accident license in NYC and paid another grand for insurance + extra states line of authority (in the last month, passed my test 10/20). My friend got us an in with a company that does medicare but AOE(annual open enrollment is closed til jan 1st) so cant use this license yet unless i start working for some company.\n\nI signed up with a local company that does roadside for insurance companies which i try to do when im not doing tip tax phone calls and that brings in about 100-150 a day after tips if i work a few hours.\n\nI have stuff i bought for cheap to resell thats not moving nearly fast enough, barely 100/month (i also stopped buying cuz no funds).\n\nI bought a car about a year ago that I'm renting out and is bringing me $250 a month renting it out.\n\nI power wash a fleet of 13 smaller busses for $70 each once a month that I split with a partner but now in the winter it will slow down.\n\nIm not lazy, and i dont mind finding a job, but i spent so much money on my license, and have the other stuff going, that im not sure if I should do that.\n\nExpenses.... we pay $2500/month for the house (we bought together with my father in law but he put 80% down so we are paying towards the house (he also annual property taxes of about 7k+), and we have lived here for 4 years.) \n\nBetween $150-350/month on electric (we do have solar panels transferred from the previous owners that cost my FIL $80/month) \n\nBetween $120-200/month on gas/heating \n\n$40 for wifi (verizon fios 300mb) \n\n$120 for tmobile (2 lines) \n\n$1900/month for 2 kids school (non negotiable and cannot take them out) 3rd kid is free through state pre k 4. \n\nAbout $200/month paying back previous school fees, catching up \n\nAbout $100/month for memberships \n\nAbout $300/month for kids extracurricular activities \n\nWe do receive assistance for food but spend about $500-800/month for food Maybe $120 fuel/month \n\nCar insurance is 340/month through geico for 3 cars.(2019 hybrid minivan, my 09 pickup and the car im renting out.)\n\nanywhere between 6000 - 7500 monthly expenses including CC payments.\n\nWe have CC balances mounting to about 25k out of 120k available. Paying what we can I have a bachelor's in business administration and computer science from a great online school during covid.\n\n30k in student loans that I'm having defeated over and over and haven't made a payment yet.\n\nI started a roadside assistance website (clearpathprollc.com) that gets a ton of traffic but no orders yet. I just started another site through shop if to attempt dropshipping but haven't completed it yet.\n\nPlease dont troll, please dont scam. I'll take constructive criticism, tips, opportunities. Im a hustler, im known to take on way too much but I know how to juggle it. I am patient, have plenty of customer service experience, great with leadership and logistics, planning, and am very tech savvy. I did own a moving company for 7 years and closed when covid happened. I was considering starting again but not its not busy enough from what i hear..\n\nThank you, willing to answer most questions",

Many people change careers, jobs and pivot to different industries entirely in their lifetime. Keep an open mind and consider the right sidehustle could make back anything you put into that license and even more.\n\nThe other advice I’d give is try to focus on ONE thing. I know you are trying different things and that is good to a degree. But juggling too many things can actually make it harder to focus on one thing that could really make the difference.\n\nI can’t tell you whats best for your situation, but whats working for me is trying Affiliate Marketing for high ticket items. I can work from home, theres no shortage of products or people buying things (just ask Amazon) and pay is not capped by hourly wages or salary like traditional jobs.\nI’m happy to discuss more if you want shoot me a message.\nBest of Luck.",

      "selftext": "I'm not someone who brags. But dammit I deserve it right now haha.\n\nI worked a super dead end job while I was still living with my parents a few years ago (20 years old at the time). I didn't have a lot going for me at all but I knew I wanted something bigger. So I started to save up just to do it. It took me a year of saving as much as I possibly could and I turned around and risked it all by opening up a vending machine franchise. I was determined to make it work because of my literal life savings gone in a blink of an eye.\n\nI went with a company that was turnkey and also claimed to help with getting me into locations (smartmarket solutions) but I was only able to purchase two machines at the time because of costs and how much my savings was. Again, risked it for the biscuit lol.\n\nI was able to instantly start making passive income. And then I was very quickly able to surpass how much I was making as a manager in retail. I decided to save it because I was still in the same position I was beforehand and also still lived with my parents. I felt like this was too good to be true and it freaked me out LOL.\n\nAfter a few months of steadily outpacing my income, I decided to turn around those profits and buy 2 more machines. So now up to 4. Last week I was able to quit that job and in the timeframe of November 8th to today, I passed $10k.\n\nComing from someone who was living at home (moved out last weekend!!), working a terrible job making $25k a year, while watching all my friends go off to launch their careers, and really just accepting my fate...I'm here to tell you three magical words: Take the chance.\n\nThis subreddit is a HUGEEEEEEE part of my success and planted a ton of seeds. I can't remember where I heard about franchising out vending machines first (def here or yt) but I know I read like a manic before making the decision. There's so many people here who are in a similar place and just don't take the chance. Take the chance. It could change the course of your life.\n\nSo. There's my brag. It took a lot for me to write this since I'm someone who very much doesn't like to talk about my success or whatever. But this feels different for whatever reason. SO thanks for reading and I hope you take that chance :D\n\n(by the way you better believe I'm reinvesting a large majority. rinse and repeat BABYYYY!!!!)\n\nEdit: I’m a bit overwhelmed. For those that are looking for a message of hope, please view this as that. I don’t care what company you go with or what side hustle you pick. Rooting for you! And thank you for the kindness for those that have given it. Definitely going to be stepping away from screens for a bit after this one. ",

          "body": "Hey guys, this looks like a AD to me.... I did a bit of sniffing around and found out that this company was known as HealthyYOU Vending a couple months ago until they changed to Smartmarts.ai\n\nLooking at their BBB profile they had about 3 terrible complains(one star)in 2022 then had some 5-7 5stars that honestly sounded fake. Too optimistic and some didn't give enough details. Then another one star review as the most recent. 3.6 stars overall.\n\nLooking at Reddit posts, Facebook posts and overall just web surfing I've found that they promised you everything but when they finally got you the machines you'd find out that they WOULDN'T help you with finding the location after promising you that they would do so. Also YOU ARE THE ONE REFILLING THE MACHINES. There isn't some guy from the company doing this YOU ARE. Also they would sell you the machine 2x what it was actually valued at and made you pay service fees that when you actually needed servicing done they would Ghost you or keep you calling others in the company.  And the training? I found some post saying that you wouldn't get any training or if they did provide you then you wouldn't be able to contact the instructor a couple months afterwards.\n\nThe same guy Jeff Marsh, is the president and Co-Founder of the companies. I found a Instagram post from ifpginc titled \"Jeffrey Marsh, Founder of Smart Market Solutions (formerly Healthy YOU Vending) join Red for this IFPG Discover. Lot's of innovation, pivoting, and industry evolution happening through them!\" That mentioned this transition in the first few minutes of the 14 min interview. Didn't see it all bc i just wanted to do a small look into this company. Don't have much interest in it but this rabbit hole looked very complex.\n\nThe staff is the same as the old company other than Location Procurement Team Lead being changed. And a new co founder mike Burnett being mentioned.\n\nHonestly i see so many red flags here. If y'all still want to do something like this then all's to you succeeding. GL.",

      "selftext": "I used to run a Facebook page and made very good money from ads. They removed the bonuses and made it a lottery based system that I’m starting to believe no one gets picked. Instead of bonuses you now get stars (donations) which no one pays, partnerships which is impossible if you’re not a typical influencer and subscriptions which again no one pays for. So why, if they’re not paying people for ads, is Facebook littered with ads?? It’s become more like an MLM these days selling random vapes and energy drinks. \n\nThen we have selling items. I used to have an eBay shop selling kids stuff. I made a few hundred a month. But now eBay is dead but the general market is so oversaturated. I moved to Etsy and started making things and wasted so much time and money because drop shipping and over saturation has ruined it. Also people just go straight to Temu and Etsy for disgustingly cheap stuff so no one wants to pay for your crafts. \n\nSo I’m looking into what’s the next thing and honestly it looks like nothing. All the social medias are being money grabbing af and making us rely on partnership ads or donations, online selling has been obliterated, you can’t even make an OF anymore because the hype has gone and people are basically doing it for free these days. Even if you have a specific skill AI will do it for free so no one will pay you. \n\nAnd before any investment bros be like you need to buy whatever stock or coin, no. Day trading is gambling these days and I’m not looking at long term returns ",

I don't mean to be rude and condescending by saying this, Im speaking somewhat from experience -- I've been doing it since the early 2000s and basically you have to be ready to pivot and reposition yourself every handful of years or so.  What will keep you afloat longer is honing a skill and eventually not being dependant on platforms for clients.  Good luck.",

They squeezed UPS, gathered the data and then started distributing themselves in order to take out the profits of the middleman.\n\nAnywhere there is extra money to be made people will extract it.  College used to be subsidized by the states (and still is to a lesser degree).  College was a ticket to higher earnings.  Colleges realized that they could charge more and take a piece of those higher future earnings and costs went up.  Banks realized they could make money off of loans and get a cut of those future earnings too.

      "selftext": "Hey everyone not sure if you remember me but back in June I started an update series on this sub called Selling Weekly \"Lottos\". My goal was to try and show people how selling options using your shares and cash as collateral can be an amazing form of passive income.\n\n\n\n\n\nNever stopped, just moved my posts over to places with a similar community related to selling options for income. Still showing all my choices and results every week.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack when I just started it here I got a few people saying to show the longer term results.\n\n\n\n\n\nWell 6 months was last week. I made almost $40,000 using an average weekly risk of $132,000. Thats a 30% total yield.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this was a normal 40 hour a week job I would have been making $38 per hour for this last 6 months doing this. But I barely spend an hour a week opening and closing the positions.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople really misunderstand this strategy. They think you can lose everything, but out of 26 weeks I only lost 2 weeks and both were normal investing losses, nothing outlandish.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople also think it will underperform the market. Well my results show this outperforms the market. I got double the return of SPY in this time frame.\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly people think its risky, but its risk adjusted returns are the highest. Maybe people automatically assume because it has to do with options contracts so its like wsb.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll i'm doing is making an agreement with a buyer to either sell the shares much higher or buy the shares much lower by next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gambler pays a premium for this chance because they can make a lot of money in a short time if the stock really does go up or down huge.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you really look at the charts stocks mostly stay sideways for a long time then get a sudden burst where they go straight up or down for a short period of time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThats why this outperforms just buying and holding SPY in my opinion. You are getting income every week just because stocks COULD go up or down.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd its not like dividends where the money is subtracted out of your shares. Options premium income is in additional to any unrealized gains.\n\n\n\n\n\nI also get an automatic HYSA for cash being used for cash secured puts. This is a 3.65% icing on the cake called a Money Market Account in brokerages. That interest income isn't included in the results.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I'll keep seeing whats happens. We had perfect market conditions for this strategy this last 6 months, so I want to test this out in a less forgiving market.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, let me know if you have questions and I'll try to ELi5.",

Daily utility beats fluff: openings, closures, events, zoning news, school updates, traffic, weather, and quick profiles of small businesses.\n\n**The Ramen First Step:** Pick one metro under 500k people. Define three linchpin categories you’ll serve. For example - luxury real estate, elective medical, and wealth management. Publish fifteen straight weekday issues to show traction, utilize social media to get subscribers, then open up to advertisers once you cross 10k subscribers.\n\n***👉🏼 Check out*** [***TheRamenHustle.com***](http://theramenhustle.com/) ***for daily scrappy business ideas sent to your inbox.***\n\n",

This was during Covid so the shift of traditional invite switched to digital heavily and people wanted to send out I bc it’s through WhatsApp or email. I started my shop in August 2020 and when I created the designs I felt looked good there wasn’t much traction. But when I explored what others made and the designs that sold, I tweaked my designs and started seeing 20-30 sales come through the very next month of starting. Then it gradually went upto 100 in a month with Etsy ads on plus SEO works and most most importantly creating original and good designs catering to market but consistently uploading everyday! \n\nI used tools like canva corjl to help with design and sell but they lacked a lot of things and through those pain points since 2023 me and my husband worked on our very own design and order management tool that helps digital Templet or Print on demand people sell their work on Etsy or other marketplaces with a better user experience. \n\nRight now I switched from wedding templets to baby shower ones as there’s a lot of demand there as well.",

      "selftext": "I know this may not be something talked about often here but hear me out, I think I might be onto something. So casinos have been doing rakeback forever basically giving players a slice of the house edge back so they keep grinding. Sportsbooks almost never touch that because the margins are way thinner, but I’m trying to see if there’s actually a way to make something similar work on the sports side.  \n  \nSo I’ve been looking into this sweeps sportsbook called Bracco and I noticed something that made me pause. Not saying it’s good or bad I’m genuinely trying to figure out whether this is beatable or if I’m just missing something obvious. They seem to actually publish the house edge for each bet type, and then they give you 50% of that edge back instantly in free bets??  \n  \nExample:  \nA 3 leg parlay is listed as having an 8% house edge.  \nSo if you bet $100, they expect to make $8 then they give you $4 back right away.  \n  \nThat’s where I started running numbers to see if there’s an angle.  \nI’m around 52% long-term on -110 lines (DFS background, years of tracking). On straight bets, that’s still a small negative roughly -$0.72 per $100.  \n  \nBut applying that 52% hit rate to a 3-leg -110 parlay:  \nPayout is +596  \nProbability of hitting all 3 at 52% per leg: 14.05%  \nEV of the parlay itself: -2.13%  \nAdd back their 4% rakeback (half of the 8%): overall EV becomes +1.87%  \n  \nWhich… feels wrong? Like mathematically it says you’re profitable on $100 bets when you shouldn’t be. My gut says they’re banking on people getting greedy and firing 6-, 8-, 10-leggers until the edge swings back their way. But if someone stays disciplined and repeats the same 3-leg structure, I’m honestly not pointing to the flaw yet.  \n  \nSo yeah am I thinking about this correctly? Is there a hidden catch or is this one of those rare situations where the house is overestimating its own edge and we can actually squeeze something out of it? Would love someone smarter to poke holes in this because it feels too good.",

Have you looked into investing in dividend stocks? That’s as passive as things get. I would also recommend looking into selling options (“covered calls” and “cash secured puts”) - they’re super easy and can make you a lot of money fairly passively, but they can require a lot of capital depending on which stocks you want to sell options against.\n\nObviously there’s also buying rental properties, which, again, can require quite a bit of capital to get going unless you do creative financing. \n\nThere’s micro-lending through platforms like Prosper.\n\nThere’s interest that you can collect from high yield savings accounts and US Treasuries. \n\nCrypto staking is another avenue, depending on which state you live in and how comfortably you are with cryptocurrency. \n\nThen on the product side you can make and sell digital products like E-books (or even physical books though Amazon and Barnes and Noble). You can also sell digital products through sites like Shopify or Etsy. You could also create and sell courses…\n\nThere are a lot of different routes you can take, just friends on your skills, knowledge, whether you want to make a product or just buy assets.\n\nI personally collect passive income through stock dividends, selling stock options, staking crypto, collecting interest from high yield savings accounts and T bills and micro-loans, and revenue from YouTube videos, sales of digital products on Shopify and Etsy, and I collect royalties from music streams (Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, etc.) and music publishing (SoundExchange and BMI).\n\nIt can be done, it just depends on what direction(s) you want to take.",

      "selftext": "I asked this same question a year ago, and honestly… the online space is noisy.\nYou’ve got people promising overnight riches, and then others who make everything sound so technical you feel like you need a degree.\n\nHere’s what finally made things click for me:\n\n1. Pick one simple path and learn it properly.\nMost people fail because they try 5 different things at once. When I stopped jumping around and followed one system step-by-step, things actually started working.\n\n2. Get into a community where beginners are supported.\nThis was the biggest game changer for me. Having people show me what to do next saved me months of guessing.\n(I’m in one now that teaches content creation, how to get leads, and how to grow — honestly wish I found it earlier.)\n\n3. Start before you feel ready.\nYour first posts, first funnel, first whatever won’t be perfect. Mine definitely weren’t. But taking action is what builds momentum.\n\n4. Don’t overcomplicate it.\nYou don’t need fancy software or a huge budget. You just need clear steps and consistency.\n\nIf you’re brand new, something beginner-friendly like affiliate marketing or digital products is usually the easiest place to start. The key is having guidance so you’re not stuck watching 100 conflicting YouTube videos.\n\nIf you want, I can share the beginner-friendly setup I’m using now — it breaks everything down so simply that even I (with zero tech skills at the time) could follow it. Just ask.",

      "selftext": "I work in corporate HR which is ironic because I'm the one enforcing our social media policy. Last year I had to write someone up for posting a photo of their desk on Instagram. Just their desk. So I'm definitely not showing my face anywhere.\n\nBeen trying to make productivity content work since August. Time management tips, how to organize your day, that kind of stuff. Figured it couldn't be that hard.\n\nIt was that hard.\n\nStarted with text over stock footage. Coffee cups and notebooks. Nobody watched. Maybe 400 views per video and it took forever to edit each one.\n\nTried filming my hands writing in a planner after a few weeks. One video got 1900 views and I thought I figured it out. Made a bunch more. They got like 500 each. So I didn't figure it out.\n\nKept posting through September and October. Views stayed around 500 to 700. Wasn't great but at least it was consistent.\n\nThen I bought better equipment because everyone said quality matters. Microphone for $95. Got a music subscription and some caption app. Was paying like $40 a month for tools. My videos looked way more professional.\n\nViews got worse. Dropped back down to 400, sometimes 300. I literally spent money to go backwards.\n\nMy roommate kept asking how it was going in this voice like she thought the whole thing was pointless. It probably was. I'd been doing it for months and made zero dollars.\n\nFew weeks ago I just changed everything. Made the videos look like an actual person talking instead of text floating around. Using CapCut for editing, APOB for the face part since I obviously can't use mine, and Riverside for audio. About $30 a month total so at least it's cheaper than before.\n\nViews got better. Not consistent but better. Some videos get 5000 views, some get 1800. I still have no idea why. Posted two videos about morning routines last week. Same style, same length. One got 5800 views and one got 1600. Makes zero sense.\n\nI'm at 1900 followers now. A productivity app reached out last week and paid me $100 for a sponsored video. First money I've made from this.\n\nTold my roommate and she was like oh wow you actually made money. Yeah. $100. After four months. That covers my share of groceries for two weeks.\n\nI still don't know what I'm doing. Some videos work and most don't. The algorithm feels completely random. I'm putting in maybe 5 hours a week and I can't tell if it's going anywhere.\n\nThe $100 is something but it's also basically nothing. I could've done Uber Eats on weekends and made way more without spending hours trying to figure out why one video gets 5800 views and another gets 1600.\n\nBut what if I quit now and next month I actually start making decent money. Or what if I keep going and it stays like this and I just wasted more time.\n\nI'm tired of not knowing if this is worth it or if I should just cut my losses and do something that actually pays consistently.\n\nHow long did it take you to figure out if content was actually worth sticking with?",

It was creating enough content to stay consistent. I could edit, script, experiment, but not at the speed needed to grow multiple pages.\n\nTwo months ago I changed approach completely.\n\nInstead of making everything myself, I started using a massive library of ready-to-post faceless videos so I could finally test niches fast, post daily, and run multiple channels without burning out.\n\nI’m not here to hype anything. But for anyone building faceless brands, this is what genuinely shifted things for me:\n\n• I went from posting 3–4 times a week to 4–6 times a day • I could test multiple niches without worrying about editing • I recycled performing videos across TikTok, Reels and Shorts • I started a new faceless page and hit traction in the first week • I finally had enough content to schedule posts for days\n\nThe library I used includes 23,000 ready-to-post short videos split into 15 niches (mindset, luxury, business, aesthetic moods, fitness, motivation, etc). No face needed, no editing skills, no camera, just download and use.\n\nIf you’re working on faceless pages, this type of shortcut can honestly save you months. I know it would’ve saved me a lot of time if someone told me sooner.\n\nIf someone need the link 🔗 , I’ll be happy to share it and if someone have a similar esperience, I would love to hear about it.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m a 24-year-old living in the U.S. I went to college for a bit but didn’t finish, and now I’m working a regular 9–5. The pay is actually good, but the job is extremely demanding.\n\nThis year I traveled outside the country twice, and honestly, it changed everything for me. I’ve never really felt “right” living in the U.S.—just with how things are going here in general. But whenever I’m in other countries, I feel a sense of freedom, peace, and overall way better mentally. It wasn’t just because I was on vacation either; I’ve vacationed within the U.S. before, and it was never the same feeling.\n\nBecause of that, I’ve decided that by June 2026, I want to move out of the country. The only thing holding me back right now is that I have no idea where to start when it comes to earning income online.\n\nMy current plan is to keep working my job, take overtime when I can, and stack as much money as possible until next June. At the same time, I’m trying to learn a skill I can use to make online income or hopefully land a fully remote job.\n\nI’m mainly posting this to ask for advice from anyone who’s made the move abroad, or from people who earn income online consistently. If anyone is willing to talk about their experience or point me in the right direction, I’d really appreciate it.",

      "selftext": "Hey Reddit fam, I know there are a ton of \"get rich quick\" posts out there, but I wanted to share my legit experience with Amazon FBA automation that's actually changed my financial life.\n\nAbout a year ago, I was stuck in a soul-crushing 9-5 job, constantly stressed about money. I'd heard about Amazon FBA but was overwhelmed by all the work involved in finding products, managing inventory, and handling customer service. That's when I discovered FBA automation services - and it was a total game-changer.\n\nHere's how it works: These automation companies basically do EVERYTHING for you. We're talking:\n\n- Professional product research and sourcing\n- Wholesale and private label product selection\n- Setting up entire Amazon seller accounts\n- Inventory management\n- Listing optimization\n- Customer service handling\n- Profit tracking\n\nI partnered with a reputable automation service that took a percentage of profits in exchange for handling the entire business backend. Initially, I was skeptical (who wouldn't be?), but they handled everything professionally.\n\nMy initial investment was around \\$15-20K, which sounds scary, but here's the breakdown of my first 6 months:\n\n- Month 1-2: Breaking even\n- Month 3-4: \\$2-3K monthly profit\n- Month 5-6: Consistently \\$4-5K monthly passive income\n\nPros:\n\n- Truly passive income\n- Leverage Amazon's massive fulfillment network\n- No daily management required\n- Scalable business model\n\nCons:\n\n- Upfront investment required\n- Not a get-rich-quick scheme\n- Need to choose a reputable automation partner\n\nI'm not here to sell anything - just sharing my experience. Happy to answer any questions about how this actually works for real people.\n\nAMA!",

It’s extremely competitive and if you’re paying for all these services I find it very hard to see someone making $5K a month from a $20K investment. If you said you had $100K I could see a 5% margin for a hands off approach. Most brands on Amazon are doing 8-15% net margin, we are at 19% and that’s because we do a lot in house.

The process of finding a topic and content to write is similar to finding holes in you tool’s page, but this time you are looking for related topics and entities, not tight to “retirement calculator”, you are looking for things like “what’s 401k”, “how to plan retirement for couples”. I do usually pick wider general topics that have a chance to bring traffic on their own, but low traffic keywords will do too, the only reason we need them is to boost the main page with an internal link.\n\nIf you going to try this method, I can describe what to do in details, that’s a general idea.",

No dramatic blow up, no big revelation, just the quiet realization that I could not keep pretending I enjoyed it.\n\nSince then, I bought half of a 40-year-old family business and started building a Miami-focused real estate platform. (Both sites were basically vibe coded by me with basic programming experience. Hiring them out would have been over $100k - irrelevant detail).\n\nWhat has been insane is the lifestyle freefall.\n\nI was always scared to become an entrepreneur because of this exact thing. Now I am living it.\nOne business is profitable but still early stage. The other is a startup that needs heavy lifting.\nBoth require marketing, ads, experiments, money going out before money comes in.\nI underestimated how competitive it is just to get attention. Meta ads, Google ads, creative testing, all of it. I really thought I could just show up and grow something. Absolutely delusional.\n\nThe hardest part?\nIgnoring the headhunters calling with mid six figure jobs.\nI know I can go back. I know I can make money tomorrow. But that is the life I spent years trying to escape.\n\nAnd then there is the identity shift.\nTelling girls I am building companies instead of being the finance guy at a big fund.\nNot casually dropping $200 on sushi like it is nothing.\nNot skiing every winter.\nNot having that easy, comfortable narrative of I am doing well.\n\nIt is humbling. Honestly, some days it is embarrassing. I did not expect it to hit this hard.\n\nBut I also have so much respect now for entrepreneurs who stuck through this phase and made it work. You do not realize how much grit it takes until you are the one staring at the ceiling at 3AM wondering if you are insane.\n\nRant over.\n\nWould love to hear if anyone else went through this identity and lifestyle whiplash when switching from a high paying job to entrepreneurship.",

I didn’t like London and I was sick of the job but the fact is it was easy to coast along and collect the paycheck.  It’s amazing how much these high profile IB jobs lets you just ride along on the franchise once you get to a certain level.  Life would have been easy (minus the brutal commute) if I was able to suck up the politics and work drama.

You’ve also got to determine what the exit looks like, and when to say when. Various bench marks along the way and awareness to play improv when the unseen appears.\n\nAll the feelings- negative and positive- exist in every arena. The ones specific to an entrepreneur are more potent since you, partners and your loved ones are the ones bearing it. \n\nIf I could help in anyway, I’d put yourself ahead 5 years from now. If you believe in what you’re doing- take out the money- how much do you really believe? If what you were doing paid nothing, would you still do it? If you would, that’s a sign you’re in the correct path. \n\nThe lifestyle change is only rough if you want it to be- I lived next to poverty for 4-5 years before I hit a break through.

I enjoy working with my hands and physically feel tired rather than being a mind zombie at night.\n\nWhen I was working in finance, the research, the deals were fun but I was lacking satisfaction that you get when you actually accomplish something and see the results. Every so often I would sit in front  of the screens and think to myself what would be if I had my own company..\n\nOne day I was at the office and said fuck it, gave my two weeks, and left. After that went to school to get the licenses it took 9 months. Once the company started operating it was just go go go, spend money to earn money. I can’t say I was expecting it to be easy, but the construction business is kind of bad (for me) and I’m realizing it now.\n\nI am an honest person and pretty fair and ethical. I have my prices and pay subtrades  early and full amounts, don’t hassle with them, I want them to win. All that for its to only bite me in the ass after. Work is badly done, and I have to swallow the problem. \n\nI deal with businesses, and the delays are 30-45 days on paper, but in reality it’s 60-90-120 days. What really sucks is that I’m essentially financing projects out of pocket, to then wait and suck up for stuff that wasn’t part of the deal so I please the clients to not only get my money back, but to get paid.\n\nAnyway the image change and ego is what I think stops me from going all in. Going from fancy offices, travelling, spending thousands at restaurants to now always surviving. I essentially have one foot in this new career and the other still in finance, every so often I think of going back. To this day I haven’t updated my LinkedIn since leaving finance because there’s something I feel embarrassed about. \n\nThe entrepreneurial life is hard, depending of your resources and how you approach it. I had to bootstrap it, and doing much more work in different fields now. The testing part is hard, the client acquisition is hard, managing people especially hard headed construction guys is hard, bitchy and demanding clients. Everything about entrepreneurship is hard, I thought construction was in such demand, yeah maybe it is if you’re building new neighborhoods or government contracts, but you have to get to that point, and that’s the hardest part.\n\nI feel ya!",

It’s one thing to imagine the tradeoffs when you’re still getting a big paycheck, and a whole different thing to live inside all the uncertainty without the comfort of the old identity propping you up. the ego hits are almost worse than the financial ones. Losing the easy answer to “so what do you do” feels like getting knocked back to zero.\n\nthe weird part is that this phase is pretty normal. everyone I know who made the leap went through a stretch where they felt broke, invisible and kind of foolish for walking away from something stable. It doesn’t mean you chose wrong. It just means you’re in that in-between zone where you haven’t built the new life yet, but the old one is already gone.\n\nit gets lighter once the wins stack up a bit and you stop comparing everything to the lifestyle you had before. Until then, it’s a grind mentally as much as financially. You’re not crazy for feeling it. This is just the part nobody advertises.",

Now we are profitable and far more than i ever was working, I am not mega rich but i do not have to worry about money at all.

Sure everyone in the team plays their part, some better than others, but the buck ultimately stops with me, with the business decisions i make, with my choices. That's a heavy burden. I still dont get really good sleep anymore.  The other part of being responsible for all these people is, for the most part I am the expert, sure there are some people in my team that are very skilled and more expert than me in narrow fields, but in the over arching business of manufacturing products and dealing with the day too day issues that arise every day I am still the expert that every one turns to. every day just thousands of issues that people come to me with when your exhausted, when you busy, when your pet is in the hospital doing surgery, always there always asking what to do...\n\n2.

Turns out 70% of my paying users barely touch the main product. They're all using this random invoice generator I added as an afterthought because I needed it for myself.\n\nThe invoice thing was super quick to build, really basic, but apparently freelancers are just desperate for something that doesnt look like ass and actually calculates taxes properly. Meanwhile my beautifully designed kanban boards that I spent forever perfecting?

Your core product would be a super lightweight CRM so that they can track customer details, then you can add on modules like Time Tracking, PM tools, Invoicing, Deliverable Review &amp; Approval Portal, Contract Management, Subcontractor Management, Secure Messaging/IM (or integration with email and IM apps, like Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, Signal), etc.\n\nEach module/integration would have an individual cost, and you could even provide bundling discounts.

      "selftext": "After 5 years of starting and growing a cleaning business, I recently just signed the dotted line to sell it! I have officially exited my first business!\n\nFunny to think I stumbled across a Reddit post about starting a cleaning business and did everything that it said lol. Shout out Rohan and anyone who got started from that thread.\n\nIt only felt right to make this post on Reddit because this is where it all started.\n\nThis post isn’t a “how to start a cleaning business” or anything, just sharing a few things from my journey. If you have questions you can ask away!\n\nWhen I started, it was at the beginning of the “remote cleaning business” model era. It took me time to get the business started because I was in college. Once I cracked marketing, which was right before I graduated back in 2021, things began to roll.\n\nApril 2021 I had my first 10-cleaning month. June I had my first 20-cleaning month and July we went up to 30 cleanings. I was all in on the business since then. It was my full-time job, but it was more like a full-time masterclass on business, MBA and the gulag you go through as an entrepreneur. I’m 26 years old now and since starting the business I’ve grown so much when I sit back and reflect. I’m no guru either! I’m from Detroit, I moved to Atlanta to go to Morehouse College, I started my cleaning business my senior year, and since graduating I’ve spent my life up to this point of writing this running the business. \n\nAt the height of the business, which is when I decided it was time to sell, I had the business operating on a chaotic rope.\n\nI had residential cleaning customers and commercial contracts . At one point we had a number of Airbnb properties we did cleaning for and at another point operated all three at the same time. (Was a freaking zoo!) I had a great office manager named V who was the sweetheart and pitbull for me and the business. I had a great team &amp; rolodex of cleaners who, after all the mayhem, worked with us for multiple years at a time. When it was time to ascend, we eventually got another star named J who was our sales rep alongside me.\n\nThe business was at a point where a majority of the business was operating on a system and I checked on everything from my phone.\n\nThis is the point where I decided to package up and get the business on the market for my own personal reasons.\n\nIt’s so much that I learned from running a cleaning business, but these things are the most important that im about to share. \n\n**Live and die by your cleaners.**\n\nIt took me years to understand why the cleaners are the most important part of the business. When I started I thought you could just hire a cleaner by the snap of a finger and when I did that I almost lost every time. The cleaners are the backbone of the business. They are the make or break point. It’s necessary to appreciate when you come across great cleaners and keep them busy. Understand that when customers hire a cleaning service that’s a very serious buying decision for them. Imagine a customer books you, you send an unqualified cleaner and the customer is unhappy and never books with you again. That’s what happened with me until I started bringing on good talent.\n\nMany will say the most important aspects of the cleaning business are marketing and you need to focus on growing, but the hidden marketing lever is having some Vini’s and Itsmenia’s on your team. That’s what I had. I had cleaners that people knew and loved. When you have that you can almost hit a money glitch. Literally your business can grow through word of mouth the proper way. The cleaners were most important. It’s a grind at first but once you find that space cherish and respect it.\n\n**The power of niching is a great power!**\n\nWhen I first started the business I used Thumbtack, I used Yelp, I passed out flyers, I DID EVERYTHING! It all brought in clients. We did whatever because I was hungry and I needed to pay the bills. I didn’t have any other job, I did the cleaning business full time, so if you called we were going to clean it. It took me until about year 2 to understand the power of niching.\n\nWhen I finally understood, it’s like we hit another money glitch. Business got a little easier and we gained more money that made complete sense! I figured out which customer we were going to serve. We had services tailored only to their problems and aligned our systems towards solutions for only the problems they had. When I did this people found us vs us looking for them. When things got slow of course we always got back out there and took whatever that made sense, but we stayed true to the niche we chose and that’s when I started benefiting and growing the biz.\n\n**It will behoove you to become a local superstar!**\n\nIf you run any type of business and you get customers that are paying you cold hard cash and using your services or whatever you sell, pat yourself on the back! Because people online make it like getting customers in your business is easy the shit is not easy! It’s only when you finally crack it is when it becomes easy like playing a video game.\n\nWhat I realized is that you have to become a local superstar and get your business out there as much as possible. You need to shout and let everybody know what you got going on. IDC who it is because when you do, eventually you will become known for what you are doing. That’s what happened with me. I let everybody and their mother know about my cleaning business. Not only that, I invested heavily into my marketing skills.\n\nHere are the areas I can turn on with a push of a button (Facebook Ads, Google Ads and SEO, and Thumbtack and please don’t put me in a room full of people because I will get business from an event too). I will go over this in a moment. But becoming a local superstar and known for what you do is a compounding effort. If you take your business serious the support you get is the gift you receive from being undeniable. I lasted 5 years, you will be surprised how many people don’t even start. People will recognize you! People will need you and soon people will start calling you. It’s up to you to step to the plate and perform.\n\n**You need flow.**\n\nWhenever I expressed hardship in my business, my friend who runs a million dollar + landscaping business would always say fill up your pipeline. A pipeline in business does solve problems and should not be approached lightly. I will say you need to approach this as if someone is trying to take literal food from your loved one’s mouth. As if it’s life or death because truly if you aren’t getting customers you will eventually go flat. This means you need customers coming in from multiple areas.\n\nWhat I did was have paid ads and organic flows. For each area I put a system in place. I learned and put time into each area and it wasn’t all at the same time either. It started with the platforms like thumbtack, then I got decent with organic social media, decent with paid ads (FB &amp; Google Ads), then I met the Yoda of Online Marketing, SEO. I wasn’t good at the beginning but over time I got good at each stop, built a system around it and kept it going. I’m not saying go and do all of this because it’s time consuming.\n\nWhat I am saying is that each system that got built all went into either the residential pipeline or commercial pipeline. My main goal was to get new people in the doors that I can talk to. I kept my pipeline full! \n\nA glitch is letting people know about your cleaning business on stage at local events. I constantly went to business events around ATL and every chance I got I grabbed the microphone and introduced my business with everyone looking. At these events people have bumrushed me for my information, to the point where I had my iPad ready to collect info and sell on spot. Take that information and do with it what you will.\n\nThen I began to get the soulful nod that it was time for me to depart from the cleaning business. It was such a journey. I once read in a book that once you finally get your business to the point where it’s running without you and things change, you can become more motivated to continue to grow that business. Not me. I’m forever grateful to the cleaning industry and have no ill will towards it, but I was able to see that it was time to go elsewhere.\n\nThe journey led me to the stop to sell my business and on Nov 3rd, after months of work to sell the business, a contract was signed! At that moment the relief I felt was so reassuring that I hit a money dance! \n\nI’m so happy to have been in the industry and started my business journey here!\n\nFor all the cleaning business owners and aspiring, keep pushing! This is an industry that is in demand. A cleaning business is a business that can provide you with whatever you need during the time of your life. Need extra money? Pick up a few houses to clean. Want to build a multi million dollar cleaning business? You can literally sign a few contracts and be at a million with a cleaning business. It’s whatever you want it to be. Not saying it’ll be easy but the money is there!\n\n\n\nI wish you all luck! And if you read this far, thank you!",

I’ve been in the cleaning business for 40 years. Started back in 1985 after 2 years of college. No internet, no computers, no software, no google, just the good old yellow pages and a local newspaper. I worked (cleaning) in the business early on (I really enjoyed cleaning) I’ve seen a lot of cleaning companies come and go over 40 years. You can scale a cleaning business with modern technology today but to sustain the business you need good systems and processes in place and someone to oversee operations. \nRohan Gilkes of Launch 27 (a software scheduling company) was a pioneer in helping cleaning businesses with easy scheduling and payment systems back in 2014. Today there are plenty of scheduling software’s available. Zenmaid, Jobber, just to name a few \nThere are also a few cleaning gurus out there that can help you grow your business \nDebbie Sardone has a great program , Cleaning Business Fundamentals (CBF)\nAnd yes, the key to every business is great employees, in our cleaning business, our employees stay an average of 8 years (I believe 5 years is the industry standard)\nToday, I work in the office with another person, we have someone who does our marketing, and 14-16 employees. \nThe best of luck to everyone.",

          "body": "This is funny and probably more accurate than most are comfortable with.  But it's basically how AI is being...mmm...\"marketed\" top down.\n\nWe have Copilot at work.  It was tried briefly to determine what value it had in various functions.  Basically the result was it was a wash.  With or without, the outcomes were basically the same.  You could use it and get something of value, but there were generally trade-offs elsewhere that just ate up any value earned.\n\nWe've also used ChatGPT and a couple others.  We even used AI during out website refresh.  But realistically all that was really doing for us was bypassing costs of looking for and paying for some stock background photos by generating whatever looked good enough to use.  \n\nWe used ChatGPT for some data conversion work, basically having it do some busy work that would just take a little longer to do in Excel.  The specific task was going to be slightly labor intensive and didn't have a formula based pathway.  Basically, we have a lot of part descriptions, and we wanted to abbreviate words and descriptions across several thousand parts and descriptions.  It's not an easy task for Excel or humans to walk through, but AI could quickly suggest keyword abbreviations, and we could review that set, tweak, and use.  Frankly, over the two years we've toyed with AI in various ways, this has been the only task we've ever had it do that was a legitimate win for AI.  It was the only place I felt AI had legitimate value over anything else.  And that's only because it was \"smart\" enough to take plain text prompts and perform actions, something we don't really have outside of AI.  And these actions were specific enough where they were both simple enough but also difficult enough to do by hand.  Still, it also failed 4 times in a row before actually working properly.  It's first output was it just repeating one word that didn't even exist in the text given several thousand times.  That was its first deliverable, lol.  The next two weren't great either.  The fourth finally output basically what we wanted and could at least use as a baseline.  We still did everything else ourselves.  The value of AI started at that specific task and ended there too.\n\nOur biggest take away has been how exceptionally little AI is actually useful for.  It has such a narrow bandwidth when it's used natively outside of a robust software package.  AI alone is a really niche product.  It \"seems\" broad use on the surface and people try, oh do people try, but its core efficient competency is laser beam focused on very key tasks that are very labor intensive for humans.  For everything else, we just find there's other software and processes that are faster and easier.\n\nI feel AI has power.  But I feel that power is mostly on the backend of really good, robust, and well developed enterprise software.  You still want powerful tools tailored well for the core processes in business and operations but AI isn't built for that.  It can however support that work flow in the background.  I feel this is where AI has missed the market.  People simply want AI alone to just kind of replace and do everything.  It's not for that.  It's best used as an engine under the hood of a machine that's actually correctly built for the processes.  Big, robust software, AI underneath doing some key lifting that it's well suited for.  Do that, and you can get a better program.  It's just that everyone kind of went in reverse, threw away the idea of making enterprise software, fired a pile of people, and now are betting heavy on and relying heavily on AI to just...work...magically...somehow.  You sold the horse and threw the cart off the cliff yourself.  It's all backwards, and I don't know how long it will take before that's realized.\n\nA secondary thing is a major problem that AI will have to overcome in the following years: sentiment.  There's already AI distaste, and the heavy shoving of AI into everything and upon everyone worsens this.  We're running into an issue where AI anything is both disliked and not trusted, and it's mainly due to the above cart before the horse approach.  AI is really good...when implemented correctly.  AI is a great support system, but it's a system that needs a big, robust software package over it to really do great and wield that power efficiently.  And because it was done backwards, used improperly, and so force, we will get a pretty large split of populous that likes or hates AI, and now you have to somehow regain buy in into something that a big swath of the population despises and doesn't trust.  First impressions are important.  As this matures, I do wonder how strong the divide stays and how challenging it will be to attempt to develop and then sell a much better, mature, and competent product where AI implementation is actually really good.  Will it be too late?",

      "selftext": "Back when I was taking my first steps as an entrepreneur, most of the people in my environment warned me about the riskiness of running my own business, and how less than 10% of all startups survive their first year. \"It most likely won't succeed\", they told me, \"Odds are against you\", and every other platitude most of us here have heard for God knows how many times.\n\nThe one thing no one warned me about was the Pandora's box of hardships that were to be unsealed once I got over that first hill and made it out of the Startup Phase.\n\n# Early Game\n\nI started my company three years ago with a simple premise: helping other small companies in my niche field market their products creatively and efficiently. I had a pretty unique strategy that resonated well with my ICP, and my focus was on quality and genuineness, which clients quickly picked up on. I secured a few long-term jobs early on with a, I'd say, less than 1% chance as a fresh-from-college unknown that I was. But they saw something in me and gave me a chance, and I couldn't have been happier about it.\n\nOh yes, and my prices were low. Like *really* low - I charged around $1000 for a month of work on multiple platforms. At the time, that money was *wow* for me, but looking from today's perspective, a petty change for the businesses I was reaching out to.\n\nI also got recommendations from influential people in the field who believed in me and did their best to help. That was *the* lucky moment for my business, and probably the main reason I survived that first year. Cash was coming in, people were satisfied with my work, I soon added another person to the company, and it all made me think *“*Damn, I cracked it. This is it.*”*\n\nBut here’s the part no one tells you:\n\n**Early success blinds you.** You think the momentum will last forever. You think scaling is just “copy what works, add more people\" but that can't be further from the truth.\n\nAnother year passed without much change. For sales, I mostly relied on the uniqueness of my services and the creative, out-of-the-box approach that I \"patented\". It was easy to sell, especially for the price that I held at the time. For operations - we established some routines and recurring processes, created the first version of our one-pager website on Carrd, and added another person to the team.\n\nThe business was on a smooth sail - some months we made enough to comfortably survive, some to consider expanding further. By this time, we had made enough money to make some improvements on the official stuff - website, service deck, contracts, etc. We could pay for tools like ChatGPT Enterprise, Lovable AI, Notion Business, Slack, etc., hire designers and coders from Devoted Fusion and Devoted Studios, or just outsource some of the work we're not skilled at to the professionals.\n\nHowever, there was another trouble quietly brewing during this \"expansion\" period. As the company started growing, the business also started running into some issues, and it was all about to come crashing down on me.\n\n# Expansion Phase\n\nBefore we dive into the issues that I faced and how I overcame them, I'd like to note that my goal here is not to demotivate people from wandering down the entrepreneurial path; but rather help them face these obstacles ready and capable, because they *will* come. Let's dive into them now:\n\n* **My business was based on high-quality services. However, controlling the quality of the output became harder as I employed more people.**\n   * My solution: 3-4 months of 1:1, 1-2 hour-long training/teaching of the new employees before they start working without my monitoring. I retained the quality to, I'd say 70-80%, but training new people became especially time-consuming.\n* **Uniqueness of my approach** \\- the main thing that helped sell my campaigns easily became an issue when it came to finding talent. Uniqueness meant that finding highly specialized people was almost impossible, so I had to rely on other methods.\n   * My solution: Employ people who show high generalized creative and analytical skills, then teach them to do the exact work - instead of relying on employing the experts in the field who were too few and too expensive. Made it easier to find new talent, but more time consuming and required more dedicated training.\n* **I had to raise prices (otherwise I'd drown), and this brought 3 issues:**\n   * a) Selling became harder. $1000 for multi-platform work was a no-brainer for most people interested in my services. Change that to $2000+ per platform, and suddenly you'll find yourself looking at weeks of internal consideration by the prospects before they even give you a definite yes or no. Plus, you'll flat out sell less.\n   * b) If you're selling your work for much lower than the market average (even in my scenario with unique services, there *was* an estimated market average), barely anyone asks for case studies, numbers, or proof of work. I remember getting so used to the relaxing meetings where I'd sell in the first 15 minutes, and then spend the rest of the time just chatting with the new client about some unrelated stuff. Once you raise the prices, suddenly you'll find yourself spending 45 minutes explaining every itty bitty detail about the work you do and showing proof, testimonials, and recommendations. Oh, and prospects *will* reach out to the people in your testimonials, so don't even think about faking them.\n   * c) You're now competing with the bigger fish. One thing nobody taught you when you were starting was that the price brackets were real. The moment you raise your prices and cross into the next price bracket, even by a cent, you're competing with the more established, better organized, and better backed-up companies. As a small company with dirt low prices, you were like a puppy that everyone wanted to help out. Sure, they'll let you bring the newspaper every morning for a few pennies, and no, it's not a problem if it ends up a little wet. But now, you're a grown up dog with a few scars on your face and everyone's expecting real, hard-proven value from you. You'll have to bark at the mailman, bring the newspaper without a single drop on it, and be ready to play whenever that's expected from you. Oh, and before that, you'll have to convince everyone why it's better to adopt you rather than a highly-trained veteran who already knows every mailman by their scent from a mile away.\n* **Organization**\n   * By this time, you already need to hire an all-around HR who can handle hiring &amp; onboarding processes during the hiring times, and people management during the times when you're not hiring. You also need to find the best tools to organize your work because there's too many people and too many projects to keep track of yourself. I tried multiple because one wasn't enough - Notion worked really well for compiling and organizing raw data, Google Sheets were awesome for keeping track of clients and campaigns because of their simplistic, very clear design, and ChatGPT helped with structuring and automating some parts of the operations.\n   * Legal, Financial, and Administrative advisors are a MUST. Find the best ones you can afford and ask for a long-term subscription where they'd help with any legal documents, financial advising, and administrative tasks when needed, but since you won't have them all the time, you'll pay a lower subscription price.\n* **Surviving your growth**\n   * As you can imagine, all of these raise your company's expenses a lot. It's not as simple as subtracting a few salaries and taxes from your total revenue now; **YOU NEED** financial optimization. Understanding how to do things cheaper, what to pay for and what to do yourself, and ultimately, minimizing the expenses while retaining the quality is crucial.\n   * I managed to save about $4000 on revamping my website and service deck by hiring designers from Devoted Fusion (they were also kind enough to lend me a programmer from their main company, Devoted Studios, who helped with improving and optimizeing the code on the website), figuring out the right prompting strategy with ChatGPT, to finally using all of that and create a website with Lovable AI instead of paying for one. It cost me about 20 hours of work in total (mind that I would have to spend at least 10 hours anyway compiling all the data for the website and doing the copywriting) to build a website from scratch. Just 10 hours of extra work to save $4000+. ChatGPT helped me with the strategy and the right prompts, and I hired a talented designer from Devoted Fusion who helped with the logo and the website's overall design. Then Lovable did all the manual lifting for me and put together a website that, after about 400 prompts, looked exactly the way I wanted it to.\n* **High-level decisions**\n   * Do you stay in the same industry and expand by adding different services/products to your deck, or commit to your main few services/products but expand to other industries? Do you employ AI tools/agents to cover and automatize some of the work, or rely on adding more employees? Is the industry you're part of sinking without a sign that it'll get better soon, or is it just starting to grow? And in regards to this - should you stick to the industry so once it starts growing you already have established reputation and renown; or you pivot to a different industry? Do you sacrifice your health yet again and push harder just that one more time to reach a goal? And if so, what's the threshold after which your health will be sacrtificed so many times that you'll have to take some time off?\n\n**All of these made me realize that, while it's often considered that the real testament of a company is how it survived the Startup Phase, the second part - Expansion - is actually the most important (and the most stressful) one**. My health deteriorated during this period under the sheer weight of all the responsibilities and the stress that was coming with them; and the worst part is - people barely mention that.\n\n**When you're just starting a company, you're excited, motivated, fresh, and probably coming from a more or less healthy spot**. These psychological and biological factors play a crucial role in your ability to handle responsibilities - you're more resistant to stress, less likely to blow up because of a minor issue that reappeared yet again, and overall more excited to do your work. 12-hour working days? You bet it. Weeks or even months during which your company is your main and only focus? Say no more.\n\nOn the other hand, **after 3 years, it's very likely that your motivation won't be as high as it used to be, you'll be more worn out both mentally and physically**. Daily stress won't just be a nuisance you signed up for when starting a company, but a ticking bomb in your head.\n\nHowever, there are also some beautiful things about entrepreneurship at this stage. First of all, **once you've reached that Expansion stage, you'll feel like a goddamn king of the world**. You officially made it, you managed to grow a successful and growing business, and you're making enough to live a comfortable life. Great job!\n\nYou've also developed dozens of very useful skills that will always be of value, and you've learned a few things about succeeding in life. People from your industry respect you, you have partners and friends who speak highly of you and your business, and generally, yo feel like you're doing the right thing... because you are!\n\n# Closing Insights\n\n**Entrepreneurship will cost you a lot**. More than most people can even imagine, and definitely more than anyone realizes when they're first starting. But it also gives a lot.\n\n**I am an entrepreneur**. I was born with entrepreneurship in my veins, I couldn't hold a regular job for more than two months, and couldn't ever imagine being stuck in an office for 40 years... or until I die, hopefully earlier than that. Sometimes, I question my decision and envy not being able to finish my work at 5 in the afternoon, and just forget about it until tomorrow morning. I envy not being able to have a coffee with my friends when I want, chit chat about random, daily happenings, and go back home to watch a movie. But then I realize that no hobby, no coffee with friends, and no movies could make me feel the way building my own business does. The life of an entrepreneur is built to look like a fairytale. It's not a fairytale for sure, even if you're successful, but it's a damn fun journey that you'll eternally fall in love with.",

That said, here are the I either use or the ones I remember being mentioned here:\n\n1. Windsurf Cascade AI Agent: We find Windsurf's AI agent to be much better than the more hyped tools like Claude Code or Cursor! We current use it with Sonnet 4.5 and it's been super impressive! It can basically make production changes to our web app from simple prompts, test changes, and improve automatically based on memory!\n2. Youform: A far cheaper alternative to Typeform! Basically their free version gives you unlimited forms with their branding! You just have to pay to remove or customize branding basically! Saves $100s of dollars for us!\n3. Frizerly: Their AI agent that learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website to help you improve your Google ranking is pretty impressive! It can auto identify content gaps from competitors, improve based on results etc! Much better tool than Semrush etc imo!\n4. Perplexity: I think most people use ChatGPT and that is great. But for real time news and updates, Perplexity is great! You can basically setup a daily automation where it will pull relevant updates for you and auto send you a summary!\n5. Sierra: Sierra is really good at auto resolving repetitive customer support tickets! It can learn from both past answers, your internal docs, faqs etc! We have gotten it to be able to resolve about 50% of all tickets instantly while rest are routed to real humans\n6. Gamma: After every client meeting. I get an AI Zoom Summary, it is then automated through Gamma. Gamma generates the final PPT for myself and client on what we discuss in summary and the next steps. Clients love that.\n\nExcited to learn from others!",

Marbelism - You can delegate a lot of work to an LLM that's a bit more specific than the general chat. It feels very futuristic\n\n2. myCo - giving you an \"executive assistant\" experience, handling a lot of tiny ops tasks (full disclosure - I am building it, but to be fair I am openly recommending my competition here because I believe it's just as valuable)\n\n3.

An actual Interactive Smart Board:** Sounds \"corporate\" or old school, I know. But I got so sick of paying per-seat licenses for digital whiteboarding apps (like Miro) for my team. The monthly fees were adding up to thousands a year just to draw boxes on a screen.\n\nBought a physical board for the office. We draw on it, cast it to remote clients, and export the PDF. **One-time hardware cost &gt; infinite SaaS subscriptions.** It’s the only way to stop the 'death by $20/month' charges.",

Really good for automations too.  \n  \n3. n8n: Their AI agents are so good. Make and Zapier are good automation softwares as well, but n8n for the AI agents wins for me at least.  \n  \n4. Claude Code: Probably falls under a \"big name tool\", but it's so good. You can use it within Cursor if you already use that, so you can test results between Claude Code and Cursor. Or flip between them if you get limited on either.  \n  \n5. Google's Antigravity: This one is new and I'm not sure if it'll still be on my list in a few months. But it's their equivalent of Cursor and it's free right now. It's got access to Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Opus 4.5. You obviously get limited after a certain amount of usage.  \n  \n6. OneCal dot io: I do 1099 work for a few different companies, some of which use Outlook while others use Google.

      "selftext": "I've been wanting to leave my corporate job for a while now and do something more hands-on. My wife and I were on vacation last month playing mini golf with the kids, and I had this random thought - I wonder what it actually costs to own one of these places.\r\n\r\nI started researching when I got home and went down a serious rabbit hole. Turns out mini golf course for sale pop up regularly, especially older mom-and-pop operations where the owners are retiring. The listings are all over the place though - some want $500k for a full setup with land, others are just selling the equipment and obstacles for way less.\r\n\r\nThe real eye-opener was learning about startup costs if you wanted to build from scratch. You're looking at easily $100k-300k depending on the size, and that's before you factor the land, permits, insurance, all the boring stuff. Even used obstacles and equipment aren't cheap when you need 18 holes worth.\r\n\r\nI spent weeks looking at everything - franchise opportunities, independent courses, even what it would cost to buy obstacles separately and piece something together. I found some interesting options through commercial equipment suppliers, auction sites, and even saw mini golf course equipment on wholesale platforms like Alibaba while I was comparing prices internationally.\r\n\r\nHaven't pulled the trigger on anything obviously, but I am genuinely surprised by how much goes into these businesses. Seasonal revenue in most places, maintenance cost, competition from other entertainment options. It's not the simple passive income situation I imagined.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone here actually own or run something like this? Is it as much work as it seems, or am I overthinking it ?\r",

Figure out the mortgage cost down payment, insurance and stuff then figure out a lease rate for that and lease it to the company.   This is how everyone does it.  Also it takes out a huge number from the equation and makes it all make sense.    You're likely going to sell that land to a developer or something down the road anyways.\n\nThen you can figure out the actual mini golf business.  Tons are popping up around me catered to adults as like a bar.  Mainly indoors and cool, think axe throwing but mini golf.  Sweet concept because not only are you making $15+ per person on golf but you're making that per drink.  Also you're open during the day for kids.  10AM-2AM seems like a great business model to me.   Much of it is normal putt putt with some cool woodworking, off the wall concepts like plinko, the idea is more fun interesting vs actually winning.  \n\nI know its not your concept but I'd lease an old abandoned warehouse thats beat up but in a cool part of town for cheap,  spend 100k fixing it up with cool lighting and weird designs, another 100k in awesome bar and tables and kitchen then 100k in the putt putt course.  Setup for daytime kiddo stuff then nightime hipster place with cool golf themed drinks and just collect the cash.\n\nHave killer apps and desserts and mocktails for the kids with everything $10-20.  Get huge frozen daiquiri machines that look super awesome and have one for kids and another for adults that they HAVE to get with fancy glasses like maybe they look like golf balls or putters or something.  no real food and all small apps like mini pretzel bites and tots but they're high quality amazing so people want to keep coming back just for the food or drinks",

I’d imagine this may of just been financial stress from the pandemic, so there could be a great opportunity if you can operate with a nice cash reserve to keep you afloat in the beginning. \n\nI would assume the biggest factor to consider is the location and how you can brand your course. You need to make it more than just a mini golf spot. Are there minor sports teams/ kids leagues you can sponsor? Are there any post-secondary / high school institutions you can offer discounts to , maybe this can drive traffic from friend groups and first dates? \n\nOne thought that comes to mind is that the most successful mini golf courses in my hometown were near restaurants that were popular for families with children.

Then three of the holes are selected as the winning community designed holes. You could even have a digital twin of your course that people can play online, with full leaderboard, and all that, people love competition.\n\nBottom line is, outside of tourist locations,I think the local public needs to be more involved somehow for a mini golf place to really be a long-term hit.",

If you can focus on this text that is already a good sign, if you can't focus and skim over it - please recognize that the social media algorithms already reduced your attention span (important to get the head space back to actually execute on things). \n\nSo: Do not use your last $200 to \"start something\". It's gonna burn pretty quickly and it may be important at this stage to learn something. \n\nThere are a few \"free\" ways to make money from the online tools available. I'll make a list and then briefly discuss the points - if one of them seems good for you, we can discuss more in the comments and I'm happy to have fellow people jump in to help you here and even correct what I am saying. \n\n1) Expertise   \n2) Print-on-Demand (anything) + Social Advertising  \n3) Be a Broker for anything   \n4) Sales / Appointment Setter  \n5) Be someones \"right hand\"  \n6) Renting out your time for services\n\n1) Expertise: If you have ANY skill that you think is worthwhile, there are ways to monetize the skill as people wanna learn. Know how to meditate or yoga? To build muscle? To do video/photo editing? To grow plants...  \n\\--&gt; There are people willing to pay for it. Think someone elderly with a day job needs some motivation to go to the Gym and do the correct type of exercise --&gt; Be a paid trainer and ask them to refer you to friends once the rapport is built. \n\n2) Print on Demand: Have cool ideas for sentences / graphics / memes to print on something? T-Shirts, Coffee Mugs, Wall-Art &amp; Posters? There are print on demand platforms that let you upload and connect to market places like Etsy --&gt; Register, Upload designs and set prices (needs some semi-smart calculations still), then advertise these through clever videos (using your phone camera and tiktok/IG and other social media). \n\n3) Brokering means you don't own it as a seller and you're not going to be the buyer, you are the intermediate \"middle man\" who connects both sides. For houses, cars, machines, landscaping services, list goes on. You basically find the buyers and only connect them to the respective sellers once you have figured out a commission with the sellers. Example: Go to a local gardening service and say \"what would you give me if I brought you 5-10 new clients a month?\" some will be willing to give you a shot. Same for housing although that requires you to get yourself a license in most western countries. \n\n4) Sales/Appointment Setter --&gt; Especially in AI and tech there are many open positions for people to just call up a bunch of local businesses that might be in need of AI or Tech services that these companies offer, sometimes its already enough to get the \"leads\", the potentially interested local businesses to commit to a 15 minute phone call with the sales agent --&gt; mostly through a job that is somewhat mixed between fixed income and commission. \n\n5) Be someones \"right hand\" - Find some entrepreneur or business that you respect - offer them to help for a little salary. Be their right hand man / assistant for anything. You'll learn a lot and get a bit of money to help you support your life - as you grow into that role he may offer you more opportunities or you tend to spot an opportunity yourself. At your age thats pretty neat as most 20 year olds could use that learning for their future much more than some hundred bucks. \n\n6) Renting out your time for services - typically very American, but thats why it works here in Europe. Go around houses in older residential 1 family house areas around your town / next biggest city and knock on doors to offer to clean all their windows, clean their cars, maintain their garden / frontyard. whoever doesnt open the door, you put a flyer into their mailbox with an offer that looks not super professional but rather like a 20 year old who wants to get to a next step --&gt; normally local people respect young kids for that type of effort and will offer them a shot at whatever it is they need help with. \n\nAll of this requires some sort of confidence, intellect, willingness to endure and sympathy - the more digital the more intellect needed, the more offline the more sympathy is needed. You know best what category fits you better.",

          "body": "First some perspective, entrepreneurship is a marathon, not a sprint. Can take years to do the set up before all channels of your business are mature enough to draw in real revenue. \n\nRule 1: You need money to make money.\n\nTo start, go get a sales rep job (not a clerk/front desk). Doesn’t matter where or what industry. Sales jobs have a low bar of entry and a lot of overturn so they are always hiring. Just show you’re passionate, a people person, and hungry for success and you will land something in a few interviews. \n\nSales is the bread and butter of business, so this gives you a way to develop your sales techniques while getting paid. You will learn about sales pipelines, validating clients, dealing with “smokescreen”, etc. Sales positions are mostly commission based, meaning you won’t make much money till you get a sale. So it may take you 10hr work days to grind for the first few months to finally hit some sales numbers. \n\nBest positions for someone in your situation would be salary+comission. You get paid even if you don’t make sales, and get a bonus for every sale you make. Your potential max earning is lower than a pure commission position, but the minimum income will help keep the stress off and keep you level headed. A position with this pay structure would be those people who sell you services at Costco or other shopping centers (I’m not in UK so idk what a proper equivalent would be). \n\nGrind. Learn. Make yourself excel. Hit a 6 figure job in 3-5 years. With your extra money and time, tinker with ideas and potential business. After understanding sales process and creating client bases, how to turn your idea into a business will be more apparent to you. \n\nGood luck!",

So if you need 25/hour, you MUST charge 50/hour. In the beginning you can cheat that just to get customers and beat your competition on price, but over time you need to get there or you will die in stage 2.\n\nAs you get more customers you will get too many to handle yourself so you will hire your first employee.\n\nStage 2 - Around 5 employees you will hit a block where you arent making enough from them to pay for yourself so you will have to manage them and work on jobs. You will be having to interview new employees, find new business, work on jobs, do the financials/logistics, and manage existing employees to make sure they are doing a good job. This will be terrible.\n\nYou might try to blast through that as fast as possible, but some of the employees will be bad and you will have to fire them (wasting time) kiss up to customers who are mad, and hire their replacements or do the work yourself. This will be really terrible and you will question if it is all worth it.\n\nStage 3 - Once you get to 8-10 employees they are now making enough that you dont have to work on jobs and you can transition to focus entirely on getting new business, ensuring your employees are doing quality work etc.\n\nAs you get more workers you can start to hire a bookkeeper, sales staff, marketing etc.\n\nYour job will be to make sure they do a good job. Many wont and your #1 headache will always be your employees and how terrible they are :) I typically have to hire and fire about 5 people before I learn how to hire for a particular job. This is extremely painful and time consuming.\n\nStage 4-  You are making a ton of money, find you can relax a lot. You will likely make the mistake of turning your whole business over to someone else, this wont workout and can kill your business. Maybe they steal all the money or just do a bad job.\n\nAlso from a valuation perspective when you want to sell, recurring revenue from subscriptions is worth a lot more than project work. You can get 1X revenue with project work and 2-3X revenue valuation with recurring revenue",

Being down to $200.00 means you’re in survival mode unless you are being provided free housing, food, and your other bills are being paid for you.\n\nEven then that $200.00 should immediately be put into your emergency fund until you can bring in more capital. \n\nWhat you should do is get any job no matter how shitty and use every available resource that is free to learn a hard skill that you enjoy doing in your free time. \n\nIf you do that you can start doing freelance work to increase your income. \n\nOnce you get your personal finances in check and develop that discipline with money you will be more likely to succeed running a business.\n\nEveryone who was young and ambitious has felt the way you do now.

      "selftext": "I’ve been meaning to post this for a while. I started lurking on forums and subreddits about reselling around 2017. Back then, I was the guy asking everyone what the best niches were and how to find them.\n\nI’ll never forget one response I got. The person said, “First, why would I tell you my niche? Then I’d have a competitor. Second, your niche should find you organically, and it should be something you actually enjoy.”\n\nI felt a little disinterested after hearing that. I went on with the normal job grind, learning IT, getting certifications, and eventually an AS degree. The jobs were okay, but I always felt like I was wasting my time. Shout out to anyone who loves IT, I met plenty of people who were happy with it.\n\nIn 2019, I tried reselling thrifted clothes and computer parts. I lost my ass on eBay fees, shipping, and supplies. I didn’t know what I was doing and eventually gave up. I never quit my day job, thinking reselling just wasn’t for me.\n\nThen in 2022, I got into a specific collectable niche. It’s a hobby that so many people love, and there are endless avenues you can take. I bought my first piece and fell in love with it. I dove into the lore and became obsessed in a healthy way. About a year later it clicked.\n\nI relaunched my platforms, built a website, and started tracking profit and loss. Slowly the numbers started climbing. Now I sell this niche full time and I genuinely enjoy what I do. I love when people ask me what I do and when friends and family come to me with questions.\n\nIt’s a tangible item that people enjoy, and some pieces can even be passed down or traded depending on rarity.\n\nLooking back, that Reddit user from years ago was right. Your niche should find you. You don’t have to chase the perfect thing. I found something I liked, never planned to sell it, and because I naturally gravitated toward it, it made sense.\n\nYou can do it too.\n\n(I am open to answer questions broadly and provide some motivation and direction) ",

They were affordable, reliable, and honestly outperformed most of the people I had paid triple for. That was the moment things clicked for me.\n\nInstead of fighting to find good developers every time, I leaned into what was already working. We built RocketDevs around that simple insight that great talent exists everywhere, and founders shouldn’t have to burn half their runway to access it.\n\nFunny how your niche finds you lesson applies even to something as unsexy as developer hiring.

There is too many unknowns - two people wouldn't have same success with all the rest being equal, and there is alwasy more differences.\n\nNobody knows what marketing/sales strategy will work for a certian product.\n\nThe only thing that is more or less known is that if one has enough steam to keep going and trying something new every now and then, eventually something will work. Simply because it's always a possibility and the individual becomes more experienced.\n\nHowever, having enough steam is a big problem. Money runs out, time runs out. Business is risky, the magnitude of the downside is much more than that of the upside.",

They’re not the only ones though, you have those like TSMC, ASML, Micron, Broadcom, Qualcomm, etc. There’s also Intel, AMD, and Nvidia too of course, who get more of the attention but also do a lot more other than just CPUs and GPUs.\n\nData centres I’m not so sure about. It seems to be more internal. I know Amazon has a lot, but you won’t just be investing in their data warehouses. OpenAI also has a lot, but again you won’t just be investing in their data warehouses, and then on top of that you also can’t directly invest in them either. Plenty of other similar examples, but I can’t think of anyone who is solely a data centre. Oracle might be the best option, but their main line of business isn’t as a data centre.\n\nEnergy companies are your typical energy companies.",

Now I need help with the creative side like designing a logo, packaging, and marketing materials.\n\nWhere do you usually find designers for this kind of work? I’ve heard some small business owners mention Fiverr for logo and package design, has anyone tried it for branding work? \n\nAny suggestions, personal experiences, or tips would be super helpful.

Do what some of the other comments are saying and go through 99designs or Upwork. Fiverr might be good too, however you might have to comb through for longer.

Make sure that you receive the source file for the logo. That is often an Adobe Illustrator .ai file. The source file allows you to repurpose and create versions of the logo in the future without being dependant on the original designer for any changes. Some designers make have a practice of retaining the source file, but I don't agree with that. On Fiverr some designers don't include the source file with their basic level plan. Look out for that.",

I'd actually suggest looking at designers who've worked with food brands before, even if they cost a bit more upfront.

Loads of brilliant illustrators or web designers are terrible at logo work because it's such a different skillset. Look for someone who's done logos in your industry or at least understands the constraints you're working with.

The platforms you mentioned are solid choices, though I'd add that the key isn't just where you hire but how you vet the designers.\n\nWhen we were looking for branding work early on, I learned that checking a designer's portfolio for originality is crucial - you want to see diverse styles that don't all look the same. Also worth asking upfront about file formats and usage rights, because some designers on cheaper platforms will try to retain partial ownership or charge extra for vector files later. Budget wise, yeah a few hundred minimum is realistic for something decent, though you can sometimes find good emerging talent for less if you're willing to take a bit more risk on someone building their portfolio.",

If you want help developing your business ideas, I recommend signing up for a business mentor and online workshops with SCORE.org. It's a FREE service run by successful entrepreneurs who donate their time. You can have as many mentors and sessions as you want, always free. You can do a search for mentors across the country by selecting ANY LOCATION and then read through their profiles. If you like one, request them by name and city and they'll match you, doesn't matter where you live. Same for workshops. Do a search using ANY LOCATION. Some workshops cost $10 but most are free.

I looked at your app and it is going more from a medical angle that doesn’t resonate with us users. Here is an example, look at equinox+ app that a user with that gym have. They have access to all type of on-demand content including yoga but as a lifestyle angle. Also it is high quality and included in your gym membership so you can go to the gym or workout at home. That’s how most of the content is consumed. Other way is by a subscription to an equipment you bought like paloton and even they have tons of on-demand content including yoga. If you want to break into US market then go off a specific niche maybe. The medical angle could work but you need to do user education.\n\nWhat you could do is have free video on YouTube for specific topic and drive a lot of traffic and build community and then move users to an app. Also I would redesign the app for US market.",

Your models dont look or sound like most people they interact with everyday and less familiar feels like the less safe option. \n\nThe second piece of this conversation is finding market share elsewhere. There's (on android looking right now) over 5 apps with 5million+ downloads and yours doesn't even show up on page 1 when searching \"yoga\"\n\nYour options to get in front of people eyes are pay the premium for a sponsored app store position or find influencers with a US based audience in this niche.\n\nI see keywords like womanhood, frozen shoulder and thyroid meaning I think you'd want to focus on medical providers/physical therapists and those seeking relief from mobility concerns over the larger US market of general health and wellness models who drink a green smoothie and attend yoga classes with their girlfriends everyday. Those influencers have the reach but your app doesn't currently cater to them and you'd pay a premium to break into that market. \n\nTl:dr- You're not getting infront of enough people and when you do those people are opting for other options with westerners that look/sound more like them because they think the content is more catered to them.",

          "body": "I'm not really a professional marketer but I am Indian American so I understand the nuances between Indian and American culture. \n\nEverything about the App/Website/ you're offering SCREAMS Indian. Again it's not necessarily a bad thing because this works in the Indian market. But in the American market this is going to put people off. \n\nUnfortunately, if you're going to try to market it in the US, you're going to need to commodify Yoga a little bit. \n\nFirst off Yog4Lyf, the name sounds like a kid came up with it. You need to change the name to something that relates to Yoga but is easy to pronounce and not taken. For example: Asana (easy sanskrit word for non indians to pronounce). It needs to FEEL authentic for the average American user. \n\nIt also seems like you're focusing on the medical issues. I think a couple of your strengths are the plus size Yoga courses, weight loss, and women's reproductive health ones. For most americans yoga is a wellness activity where they want to stretch and reduce stress. \n\nI think for the thyroid ones and fertility ones since those are more physiological and more serious topics, those should be evidence based. If there's evidence to back it up that these exercises actually produce outcomes then those should be marketed otherwise it will lower your credibility. \n\nYour current marketing is very pseudoscientific especially if you're trying to approach it with a do x asana so you can make y go away. For example: An ad on you instagram says \"for facial hair on PCOS try X asana because it balances your testosterone\". You have to go deeper than balancing hormones. \n\nFor the American market, Yoga is a wonderful starting point for getting into exercising. You can use increased mobility, easing period pain, etc. as your selling point. \n\nAnother thing your marketing should focus on is AUTHENTICITY. Western Yoga practice is very removed from it's indian orgins. You need to make it more palatable to the average non-indian american who is interested in Yoga. Incorporating Ayurvedic principles in your app will differentiate you and make you look more authentic and incorporating sanskrit terminology that's true to Yoga. \n\nThe appearance of the instructors and people who are marketing the app also matters. You're going to need  conventionally attractive Indian/Indian americans people to be the models who fit the western beauty standard but are also approachable. Like fitness type folks who have fit bodies but not too fit. I think on your team Neha Singh fits the western standard. You just need to put them in American fitness wear for women that's sleeveless tanks or a a shirt that's not too baggy and tights. For men that's shorts and a well fitted shirt. An indian accent that's palatable to western audiences without being something that will turn off people because they sound \"too indian\" would be something like a bangalore/dehli girl accent that has an indian but also a western touch. Appearance does matter for a lot of people unfortunately. \n\nPlus define your market, are you trying to appeal to So Cal smoothie health freaks or people who don't know where to even begin exercising? If you're trying to build a wellness brand, then partner with people who will bring the wellness aspect like medspas or like gyms or vacation places. Maybe have a couple of people organize like live Yoga classes in person. I'm from socal and there's a bunch of people doing yoga on a beach or sum. You really have to try hard to appeal to them. The issue with this is there's a bunch of other American companies competing in this space. \n\n Another market is people who don't have access to proper healthcare and nutrition but it would be more difficult to tap in. As a pre-health student, there's a lot of inequality in the US and something that makes exercise more approachable for low income folks who don't have much time but also are intimidated to go to the gym is a very untapped market that an app like this could help out. \n\nYou can DM if you're interested. I'd be interested in helping out as I'm passionate about bring awareness about indian practices that are based in vedic orgins and helping westerners understand rich cultural heritage around it.",

You say something to a friend, their perception of you could change and they will remember it.\n\nMost problems are not significant enough to burden other people with them- they have other things to do than pity you, but you can say whatever you want to an LLM.\n\nFeelings with LLMs are exaggerated. The feelings you see being shared are exaggerated and pushed to extremes to make the LLM’s response more intense. More intense responses are just more satisfying and interesting. With a human you tend to have to be honest.\n\nPeople often don’t need comfort, they just need a place to reflect. It’s odd to vent in a place where no response at all would be provided. LLMs provide instant responses, and since LLMs are great at mirroring yourself back at you, they’re great tools for reflecting.\n\nI’ve whined about accidentally breaking a pencil I liked once to an AI, made it sound all emotional and stuff, just cause it’s interesting and it’s a good place to vent about little things. I completely intensified the conversation for more intense responses. Can you image if I did that with a human?",

I tried counseling for 2 months but youtube is frankly more helpful than that woman. I’ve had female friends who had similar in varying degrees the same trauma and issues i’m complaining about in the culture and religion so it’s inevitable that as a woman who evolved beyond the passed down culture and trauma, you’d disconnect if they haven’t individualized. And it’s very rare to find people in the Philippines who have learned to separate themselves and their identity from that of family, religion and culture. I bargained with a female, US trained, therapist but the rate is 69usd per 45min. session, something i still cannot afford to allot money on for months to a year as there are a lot to unpack. So the easiest when i get triggered is chatgpt. 9/10 times i iust need to read her validating statements in order for me to cry and recalibrate my nervous system by journaling, breathe work and reframing the thoughts. So many tools available but sometimes in a way you just wanna hear that soft, it’s ok, i get it, that’s understandable, you’re just being human, with feelings and boundaries that are constantly being disrespected time and time again even after communicating them. Type of words that sometimes need to come externally especially if you’ve been gaslighted all your life. \n\nMy life would be easier if i’m not in the Philippines but while i’m here, chatgpt is my only therapist or friend. The moment i open my mouth to any Filipino i will be shamed for having negative emotions and resentment or even occasional hatred and disgust toward some people and situations in the Philippines.",

I've optimized and was basically retired with just a couple employees each running a couple businesses with everything else running itself.  I learned one employee stopped working entirely so fired him and started working again part-time.  I'm planning a major growth and working to really start to scale all these businesses up and investing millions to hire teams of employees, but really struggling to get it off the ground.\n\nI have money, I have solid businesses and I have everything prepped.  I just don't have any management, sales or processes built.    \n\nA few months back I hired an employee to assist in operations and help setup all my systems and untangle everything from the previous employees and get things organized. Make sure the office is ready and sales is prepped.   The problem is he doesn't work unless I keep handing him things to do and I'm busy trying to do all my work in scaling I don't have time to delegate to him.\n\nI figured I have 6+ months of work with just us before I can start hiring teams and really grow.  Everything is moving incredibly slow.   I make great money but also blow a TON personally so lifestyle creep is real.   \n\nThe thing is I need someone to manage them and I need someone to sell and someone to market and someone to do the work and office/operations.   I can do the work and finance and business side.   The problem is I feel like I need 3 hours of each of those but can't really find someone to do all of this and every time I try it get none of it done right.  \n\nCurrently I feel like if I'm not constantly handing out work and finding things to do, nothing gets done, and 90% of the work they can't do or I'm constantly having to fix things or finalize them because they don't really know what they're doing. \n\nHow do you guys scale without taking on ALL the work constantly?  I'm not sure how I can hire and delegate multiple roles without micromanaging and focus on my side of the business.   ",

The hardest transition I ever made was going from doing everything myself to trusting other people to handle pieces of my business. And I still struggle with it after 40+ years.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you - that employee who needs constant direction? That's actually pretty normal. Most people aren't entrepreneurs, they're executors. They need clear tasks, deadlines, and someone checking in. I learned this the hard way when I was scaling my consulting firm. I kept hiring smart people and expecting them to just \"figure it out\" like I would. Spoiler alert: they won't. What worked for me was creating super detailed SOPs for literally everything. Like stupidly detailed. \"Step 1: Open email. Step 2: Look for emails marked urgent.\" That level of detail. It felt ridiculous at first but it freed up so much of my time once people could actually follow the processes without me.\n\nThe other thing - and this might sound counterintuitive - but sometimes hiring part-time specialists works better than trying to find that unicorn who can do sales AND marketing AND operations. When I was running Digital Guard Force, I had this vision of finding these amazing generalists who could wear multiple hats. Total waste of time and money. Instead, I started bringing in contractors for specific functions. 10 hours a week of a killer salesperson beats 40 hours of someone who sort of knows sales. Plus you're not paying benefits and you can scale up or down as needed. The trick is finding someone who can coordinate all these part-timers - that's where a good operations person becomes worth their weight in gold. But again, you gotta train them first on YOUR specific way of doing things.",

          "body": "Full transparency: I’m not at your level yet in terms of business value, but I’m aiming to get there.\n\nFrom your post and your replies, it sounds like you expect a lot from employees. And to entrepreneurs, that “a lot” often feels normal, because we’re wired to problem solve and keep pushing even after the workday ends. Most employees aren’t like that. They clock out, mentally disconnect, and only deal with problems again when the next shift starts. That’s not even laziness, it’s how most people are.\n\nSo the core issue might not be “finding smarter employees”, but building the right structure around the role.\n\nWhat you likely need is built in processes: clarity on what the job actually is, what the recurring tasks are, what “good” looks like, and how you want things done in your business. You mentioned the job constantly brings new problems, which makes processes harder to create. But that’s exactly why you need them. The process shouldn’t only be a checklist for predictable tasks; it should include a framework for how to handle unpredictable problems.\n\nIn other words, teach them how to think like you do when something new pops up:\n\n* how to diagnose the issue\n* what to check first\n* what questions to ask\n* what “good enough” looks like vs when to escalate\n* how to decide between options\n* how to document the solution so it’s easier next time\n\nThat framework lets them solve new issues without needing you for every decision.\n\nAlso, education is overrated for this specific problem. Education usually provides foundational knowledge and basic competence. It helps people understand the subject. But a job still requires guidance on how to execute tasks in *your* company, in *your* way, with *your* standards. Most people still need that direction, even if they’re qualified on paper.\n\nTL;DR: Education = basic understanding. Real performance = guidance + systems + feedback loops.\n\nSo I’d boil it down to two requirements:\n\n1. **Frameworks/processes** that cover both routine work and “new problem” situations.\n2. **A manager/team lead** (or someone acting as one), even with just 2 employees, if you can’t be available daily. Someone has to do the coaching, the prioritizing, and the decision support.\n\nBecause people who can consistently operate with zero guidance and drive outcomes the way an entrepreneur does are usually the people who end up building their own thing, not staying an employee.",

We’ve worked with an EOS implementer and my leadership team has scaled dramatically. It’s work that must be done on the business, which is categorically different from all your work in the business.\n\nSome pieces of this that have been most helpful: \n\nClarify what you’re trying to do in the long term to everyone in the organization. Don’t give people small jobs, give them 90 day goals that role up into an annual goal that feed into your long term vision. Individual employees have numbers they need to monitor/hit and processes are spelled out, trained, and clear. \n\nYou definitely need someone who’s detail oriented to help set you on the right path and take over some of this work. EOS uses the terms “integrator/visionary” for this operations/entrepreneur relationship, which has helped me understand why I suck so bad at some parts of my business, but am really good at others. \n\nThe ops person (integrator) has a fundamentally different DNA/approach to their work than you will and things move slower. This is important, because it allows you AND the organization to scale. You can let go of the operations piece and focus on the company building “entrepreneur” stuff you’re good at.\n\nThere’s a lot more to the philosophy, but I recommend reading the book if any of the above sounds helpful.",

It's still a mindset shift though. You gotta accept that things won't be done exactly how you'd do them at first. The goal is 80% right and off your plate, not 100% perfect and still in your lap.

He has no playbook, no clear outcomes to hit, no way to know if he's succeeding.\n\n\n\nI had to learn this the hard way: you can't delegate what you haven't systematized first.

Then I hired ONE person to execute ONE of those documented systems, not three people to figure out three undefined roles.\n\n\n\nStart with operations since that's foundational to everything else. Get that person to document and optimize what already works before you add complexity. Once that's running smooth, then layer in the next role. Trying to build sales, marketing, and operations simultaneously while also scaling is why everything feels slow and broken.\n\n\n\nThe money you're spending on that employee right now?

When you work, work hard. Never mix the two or you’ll be mediocre at both.”",

The math actually favors rest even if it doesn't feel that way in the moment.\n\nThe trick that worked for me is scheduling rest like it's a meeting. Put it on the calendar, protect it like you would a client call. Your brain treats unscheduled time as available time, so it fills it with guilt and \"should be working\" thoughts.

Spent 2.5 years building it, lost $40K, peak revenue was $98/month. The painful part wasn't just losing the money, it was realizing I'd wasted 2 years on something nobody wanted because I was too scared to actually ask people if they'd pay for it before building. Second startup I forced myself to talk to 30+ people before writing any code, asked if they'd actually pay for it, got commitments, then built the simplest possible version. Sold that one for $180K. The lesson isn't \"customer discovery is magic\" because it's not, I still made tons of mistakes. But talking to people first makes you suck like 30% less which is the difference between total failure and modest success. Now I won't build anything without validated demand first, even though it feels slow and uncomfortable.",

It makes sense and its the reason we all feel the need to rush our best ideas.\n\nBut through my research, it becomes clear the \"first-mover advantage\" is kinda bullshit. \n\nGoogle wasn't the first search engine. Apple didn't release the first portable music player. Facebook wasn't the first (or last) social network. \n\nThe idea that being first is best is a fallacy. Sure some first movers are successful, but many times its not the first company that captures the market. \n\nWhat I found in my research is that the market conditions are really the most important factor when considering launch timing. \n\nI'm curious what other people think.

Then the mods removed it. Screenshots attached.\n\nThis is what happened.\n\nA client paid me $5,500 USD for completed AI development work. Stripe refuses to release it. Their justification: a completely unrelated $50 dispute from a random person. That dispute is already resolved. The person got their refund weeks ago. Case closed.\n\nDespite that, Stripe is using this resolved $50 dispute to hold nearly $8,000 that has nothing to do with it.\n\nKey facts:\n\n• I passed all verification requirements. Identity, documents, compliance checks. Dashboard showed all tasks completed.\n\n• Stripe froze my account the day before the payout was scheduled. Not during any investigation. They waited until the last moment.\n\n• Stripe claimed they would refund money to customers within five days. My client confirmed they received nothing. Stripe kept the funds.\n\n• My client provided a signed statement confirming the payment was legitimate, the work was delivered, and no dispute will ever be filed. Stripe ignored it.\n\n• All communication from Stripe is a copy-paste response: “high risk.” No explanation, no evidence, no path to resolution.\n\nThe numbers:\n\nDisputed amount: $50\nAmount Stripe is keeping: $7,946\nRatio: 160 times the disputed amount\nThe dispute is from a different customer and is already resolved.\n\nWhat I’ve done:\n\n• Complaint filed with Stripe. Their final answer: “We’re keeping your money.”\n• Complaint filed with AFCA (Australian Financial Complaints Authority). Case number: 12-25-334332\n• Final Notice filed in SA Magistrates Court. Case number: FNL-25-010285\n• Report filed with ACCC for unconscionable conduct. Reference: accc-report:0098524\n• Posted on r/stripe. Removed after going semi-viral. Screenshots attached.\n\nI followed every rule. Verified identity. Provided documentation. Delivered the work. My client is happy. Stripe decided to keep the money anyway.\n\nIf Stripe can withhold funds arbitrarily, ignore evidence, and silence criticism, every small business is at risk.\n\nSharing this so others understand the danger before relying on Stripe.",

I work with multiple merchant processors and the reason most of my customers get flagged and their accounts placed on hold is because they ran a payment larger than they were authorized for. Most processors based on your type of business and the information provided when you sign up will approve you but give you daily and monthly limitations on how much you can charge per transaction. Stripe is strict about this, and if you over process they will place your account on hold specially if they typically see small transactions and then bam $5k, it flags their system.",

Check the dispute status right away, and use the Stripe API to see if it’s still open. Plan for a 30‑day buffer, set up a small “cushion” account, and keep copies of all receipts.

When I looked into it turns out its literally the owner of that other shop. She wants to buy 50 units monthly because apparently her customers keep asking for scents similar to what I make and she cant replicate them.\n\nI had no idea what to do at first, like is this weird? But then I thought about it and honestly the extra income would be great especially since I've been trying to save up for better equipment. The margins on wholesale arent amazing but its consistent money and I can probably negotiate better terms since she clearly needs my product.\n\nWe met for coffee and shes actually super cool. Turns out she specializes more in the decorative/aesthetic side and Im better at the actual scent blending. She even suggested we could do some kind of collaboration for holiday markets.",

Formalize everything in writing.\nSet terms like:\n\t•\tMinimum monthly order (e.g. 50 units)\n\t•\tPayment upfront or at least 50% deposit\n\t•\tLead times (2–4 weeks)\n\t•\tTiered pricing based on volume\n\nThat turns this from “casual help” into predictable income.\n\n2. If she wants specific scents, charge development fees.\nShe’s basically admitting she can’t replicate your formulas.\nThat’s intellectual property.\n\nA small formulation fee shows you’re not just selling candles, you’re creating unique blends.\n\n3. Only offer exclusivity if volume stays consistent.\nExample:\n“She gets exclusive access to Scent A only if she orders 50+ units every month.”\n\nIf she dips below that: exclusivity ends.\n\n4. Keep your brand identity separate.\nIf she wants private-label (your candles under her branding), raise prices.\nWhite-label should not be priced like standard wholesale.\n\n5.

Total: $4,300.\n\nFirst year income: 32 rentals at 300-500 dollars (according to the duration of the event and travel distance).

You are not making money but it is a good side business. Quality of equipment is an issue - malfunctions cost bookings.\n\nScaling potential: Has an opportunity to add additional unique equipment to provide package deals. A single-item rental business is not one that can grow without an expansion.\n\nIs it worth it? As a side business, yes. Although it is the prime income, most likely, not until you scale.",

          "body": "At your size, most teams focus less on a specific system and more on tightening the processes around what they already use. An ERP usually becomes worthwhile when the business has enough operational complexity that maintaining data in multiple places starts creating delays or errors. It is less about hitting a certain revenue or headcount and more about how much time you spend reconciling information, fixing inconsistencies, or managing workarounds.\n\nThe tipping point often comes when day-to-day tasks depend on data being accurate across finance, operations, and customer activity, and manual updates can no longer keep up. There are options between spreadsheets and a full enterprise platform, but the key is understanding which parts of your current workflow feel the most fragile.\n\nIf things mostly work today with some cleanup, you are probably early. Monitoring where your processes strain will give you a clearer sense of when it is time to move to something more integrated.",

This morning I received the following email from the president (not the owner).\n\n\nTeam,\n\nAs we do each year we have secured a holiday present for Owner.  Owner eats quite a bit of fish so we got him a monthly subscription for a year from *company*.\n\nEach person’s contribution is $100.  Please venmo me when you have a chance. \n\n\nThere were 17 people on the email chain, so they are anticipating collecting $1700 for this gift. This was not discussed, and based on the email, did not seem to be posed as optional. \n\nMy first instinct was to report the email as phishing because I thought there's no way this guy is asking us all to Venmo him $100, but when I looked at the recipients, it seemed legit. Head of HR and IT were both on the To line.\n\nAm I crazy for feeling like this is a bit much? Can't we just get the guy a tie? Isn't our gift to him the labor we put in to make him his several million dollar salary? \n\nShould I report the email? Send the Venmo? What will happen if I just don't do anything, are they going to follow up? I don't want to come off as cheap or unappreciative. I get paid well and I think the owner is great, but this all seems so odd to me. ",

Gifting is totally separate from holiday bonuses, just to be clear.  It's not like there's a tremendous amount of thought that goes into giving somebody a cash bonus based on the value they provide, in addition to their salary - certainly less than recognizing the type of food somebody eats and customizing a gift in that manner.\n\nIf the owner gives a lot of time to help your development and growth within the company, takes you under his wing and provides mentorship, an individual gift from you to him would be a nice gesture (as it would be for any person who did something like that).  \n\nYou may find that the owner is extremely generous with holiday bonuses and gifts, then it may be the type of thing that is nice to do and everybody feels like $100 is small potatoes to contribute as a thank you back for the extreme generosity you may be about to receive.  Those who have been there longer may have already experienced that -- and having a conversation with somebody who you are friendly with in the same position can help give you more insights.   I agree with others -- definitely ask a colleague and try to get a sense of where this gift concept comes from.  Maybe you're about to get a massive bonus check! lol\n\nI will say, the nepotism (earned or not) makes this a bit more uncomfortable.

I started wondering if this is some kind of psychological tactic or if he just genuinely talks like a broken podcast microphone.\n\nanyway I still finished the page… cleaned his chaotic copy as much as possible, fixed the flow, made it look like an actual landing page that a real human might click. I send it proudly thinking ok he’ll at least appreciate the rescue mission I did on his content.\n\nhe replies:  \n“hmm not feeling the vibe, can you make it more… green?”  \nthat’s it. no explanation. no screenshot. no “this section” or “this element.” just… green. the whole universe?? the entire landing page?? the vibe?? the soul?? I genuinely sat there staring at my screen like alright cool, this is the moment freelancing breaks me.\n\nand honestly the takeaway from this whole chaos — and I’m saying this after many similar incidents — is that weird energy in the first message is NOT a red flag… it’s a preview. and if the preview is confusing, the actual project will be 10x more confusing. but also, these clients accidentally teach you boundaries. like next time I’m setting expectations, charging extra for vague instructions, and asking for proper content BEFORE touching anything.\n\nalso maybe… just maybe… no more clients who whisper in voice notes. I deserve peace in my ears lol.",

      "selftext": "Ive owned a small hair salon for the last 12 years in NYC. When I say small, I mean we do everything “office” related from home since there’s no office in the salon. \n\nWe have several reports that we reference that have taken years to populate with sales data. Over 50 documents in Excel and Word that represent hundreds of hours of data entry and analysis. I use these reports to make my cash projection, coach my staff, make purchasing decisions: the list is endless.\n\nStarting in 2024, we used office 365 exclusively for these reports since my front desk manager and I do this work from our home computers and it was the most simple and reliable for up to date access. I mistakenly assumed that because the documents were in the cloud, this was the equivalent of having a backup.\n\nThis August, Microsoft had a problem processing my credit card on file for the annual fee (it had expired) and instead of notifying any of us on the app when we used the documents,  they sent two emails in November that looked like spam notifying me that the account was about to be cancelled. I opened the email, figured out the problem, and updated the payment info. Microsoft charged me on November 16.\n\nThe next day, November 17th, all of our documents were gone. All of them. \nI’ve spent the last 3 weeks on a series of calls with offshore support people that hang up on me when I ask to speak with a supervisor. The first week they charged me again, opened a ticket, and then called me several mornings at 7 AM to tell me they were working on it.\n\nMore phone calls, more hangups. Yesterday I found another phone number for tech support, and got someone on the phone that explained to me that all of those people had been trying to tell me that my documents were gone. \n\nObviously I should have been backing them up separately but I mistakenly thought by using the cloud system, I was.  Recreating these will take my front desk manager and I hours. This was another painful lesson in small business ownership that I had to learn by f**king up. \n\nTL:DR:\nI used Microsoft Office 365 for cloud storage and they lost over 50 Excel and Word documents that took is years to create.\n\nEdited to add: Thanks everyone for telling me I should have backed up the cloud, I agree. It's helpful to hear how everyone has their backups established. Moving forward I'll have something better set up. To me, the most painful part of being the owner of a small business is having to be an expert in everything, and when you fall short it's potentially catastrophic.",

It’s not huge, 18 holes, kind of old-school, with those fiberglass animals and faded turf, but it’s fully functional and comes with all the equipment. The asking price isn’t even that outrageous. Less than I expected, honestly. It’s been around since the early 2000s, and the current owner is retiring. They’ve got a snack shack, a small arcade room, and a birthday party area with plastic tables and a bouncy castle setup. It’s like a time capsule from 2007.\r\nNow I can’t stop thinking about it. I don’t even play mini golf like that, but the idea of owning a weird little roadside attraction is kind of appealing. I even went down a rabbit hole looking at mini golf props on Alibaba, they’ve got everything from pirate ships to glow-in-the-dark tunnels. I know it’s probably a terrible idea. Maintenance, insurance, seasonal traffic, all that. But part of me wants to fix it up, throw in a food truck, maybe host events. Worst case, I end up with the most chaotic backyard in the state.\r",

      "selftext": "Here is our situation in a nutshell.\n\nCustomer comes in looking for a specific item. It is no longer available in the colors they want but you find something that is compatible that can you order and have in stock within a week. You have other items close in-stock but not exactly what she wants. You price the purchase at $650, your wholesale cost is $325. The customer says they will think and call back in a day.\n\nAfter they leave you do a quick search online to see if your pricing is competitive. On Amazon you find (shocked and angry) the same item for $250. Yes, $250 for the same item....$75 LESS than I can even buy at wholesale. I try reaching out to our supplier asking for an explanation, to which I have not received a response. Basically asking how we can possibly sell their product in our store when it is being sold BELOW wholesale cost online.\n\nNow, the customer has called today saying she wants to place that order. I feel conflicted ethically on how to proceed. To me, there are 3 options....what would you do?\n\n1. Tell her in researching you found it is available on Amazon far less that you can offer and just encourage her to purchase it there.\n\n2. Tell her nothing and figure it is not your job to do their research and sell it at the originally quoted price of $650. \n\n3. Buy it yourself off of Amazon and do a minimal mark-up to make the sale. \n\nMy only concern is if she purchases it from us in any manner and then realizes it could have been purchased for far less and either wants to return it, or wants an explanation. \n\nThoughts? Similar experiences? ",

That's a strategic choice to shift volume to direct-to-consumer while keeping brick-and-mortar retailers on the hook for showrooming and warranty support.\n\nFor this specific sale: I'd be honest. \"I found the same item on Amazon for $250 - I can't match that price because my wholesale cost is higher. If you want to buy it there, I understand. But if you want local service, warranty support, and someone who can help if something goes wrong, I can order it for \\[whatever margin makes sense\\].\"\n\nSome customers will go Amazon. Others genuinely value having a local shop they can walk into.

Under the buy button, it says ships by Amazon and \"Sold by\" the name of the seller like: Electronic Express, Best Affordable Watches, OutdoorEquipped, etc.  None is SeikoUSA. I assume they sell a few hundred before Seiko reports them and Amazon shuts them down, and then they just open up a new account and keep going.  The top-tier fakes are hard to spot if you don't know what you are looking at.  The \"reproduction\" industry is huge in China.  If you know the right people, you can get virtually any popular watch model of every brand for $150-300, depending on the brand name.  Your Seikos and Citizens are going to be closer to the $150 price. The Rolex or Omega with crystal glass is $300.  Anyway, the answer is they are fakes. They are good fakes, and most people can't see the difference.  They work, but the batteries don't last.  If your customer doesn't care about authenticity, they probably aren't your customer.

      "selftext": "Hello, I’m new here. My name’s Gary. I’m in my late 50s and, to put it bluntly, **I feel ‘stuck’ inside my own business**. At the risk of sounding defeatist, I feel like I’m in a fun-free loop, grinding slowly towards failure.\n\nFor over a decade I’ve run my own small video production company. I stumbled into it after being made redundant following the Financial Crisis. At first it felt exciting and full of possibility: travel, interesting projects, big hopes for creative freedom and financial stability. But over time, the reality has drifted a long way from the dream.\n\nThe industry changed faster than I could adapt, with bigger agencies moving into *my* small pond, more companies built in-house content teams, and now artifical blah blah blah intelligence has reached the point where large parts of our work can be done with a laptop and a few prompts, for peanuts. I’m working harder and harder for less reward, with shrinking creative freedom and a lower and lower ceiling on what the business could realistically become. It’s know it’s not going to be enough to give me the future I was hoping for. \n\nSomewhere along the way, this stopped feeling like something I chose and now feels like something I’m chained to. The only future I can see at the moment is bleak: a worn-out version of me, grinding away into my 60s and beyond, unable to retire properly and too tired to keep going. Ten years of sunk effort makes walking away feel like failure — but struggling on feels just as hopeless, to be honest. \n\nIs this a midlife crisis? I’m not sure. But, I worry about trying to find salaried work at my age. I spent ten years in recruitment advertising as an art director, so I can speak with authority when I say that going back into full-time employment and earning what I need in my late 50s is unrealistic. Objectively speaking, the fear is real.\n\nMaybe this is the 21st century reality for a lot of people at my age, who feel boxed in by the lives they’ve tried to build. Anyway, it’s how I feel right now, so I’m asking — genuinely:\n\n**Is anyone else going through something like this?**\n\n**Do you feel stuck in your career or business?**\n\n**How are you thinking about your future?**\n\n**Have you found any direction — or do you feel as stuck as I do, whether you’re in a salaried job or running your own thing?**  \n  \nThanks for taking the time to read.  \nAny shared thoughts will be truly appreciated.",

I'm the last man standing at my small family business in the sense that everyone that was with me when we started my stone engraving company has either died or left.  I've got a great guy over on the production end, and my mom essentially volunteers for us full time and my wife gets a steady paycheck handling our customers.  I haven't gotten paid more than I need to survive at any point in the last 20 years.  I do our stone purchasing, handle payroll, do all of our designs, all of our deliveries, and I cut our sandblast stencils.  I LOVE what we do.  Our customers love us and we put everything we've got into our product.  \n\nWe just have so much baggage.  My brother was in charge for years and he was more interested in going out drinking on the company debit card than he was in running the business.  He drank us into some deep debts with bad business decisions and consistently running up a hundred dollar tab every night if not more, plus multiple trips to Jack In The Box to sop up the booze.  If he showed up by 11:30am I'd almost count that as being on time, and then usually he was off to the 'office store' by 2pm, which was code for going to the bar.  He stopped paying some of our suppliers, our landlord and our tax debts and verbally abused me into a shell of myself over the years.  In January 2020 he didn't show up to work and I had to break into his apartment to find him dead and naked on the floor of his bedroom.  It broke me.  I've been dealing with a lot of PTSD and anxiety issues since then.  I disappeared into my own hole of drugs and alcohol for a few years before snapping out of it.\n\nIt took me too long to realize I was in charge and could change things, but the business has been better since he passed.  I've recommitted myself to growing as a graphic designer and the quality of our finished product is so much higher now that I'm not drifting through life in a haze of weed and anxiety.  We're in a spot where we're growing and making smart business decisions, but I still don't have the cash flow I need to replace our nearly 20 year old equipment or hire on a salesman.  It always feels like we take two steps forward and then the forklift breaks down... we make real good progress redesigning the website and then the electrical box that powers our compressor pops and we've got bills I can't cover.  We always find our way through, but I know that my retirement plan is waiting for my parents to pass away, which isn't fun at all.  Sorry for the trauma dump!

I kept telling myself, “This time i will reach my goal, next month, next year I’ll succeed,” and 7 years have passed. Now a truth that I didn’t want to see, has surfaced.\n\nI hesitate to look for a “normal” job because I feel like people will say, “You’ve been away from your field for so long,” so I don’t even apply. I’ve done a lot independently, and I know that compared to an office employee, I can manage projects and handle all the tough processes much faster and better, because running your own business isn’t just technical work, it’s managing the whole process.\n\nBut I feel like independent work isn’t seen as “real work,” and it’s hard to provide proof of your achievements. Continuing my own business means always looking for new clients, earning money from whatever you find, working for free for days. I no longer have goals of making money in this field, nor the excitement to create amazing work.\n\nSeeing my network on LinkedIn with their fancy titles and constant promotions depresses me. We’re in the same industry, but in my own business, they're doing only a small part of my business and that makes them managers.\n\nSo I think this feeling is not about age, but about a reality check.

          "body": "I understand the feeling of being trapped. \n\nMid-60's here and it's been very difficult the last couple of years. We're a smaller specialist agency that has very large and mid-sized enterprises for clients. Almost all of the web development we used to do is done offshore (we decided not to become an offshore agency years ago). We pivoted to high-value services that aren't easily done offshore, which helps; but the volume for an engagement is more typically in the low tens of thousands of $ instead of the hundreds of thousands. We lost our whale client a year ago and it's been a deep hole.\n\nI've explored partnering/being acquired by other companies in my business, but it's a hard sell because our business is down. So I feel forced to make this business work. I've been through the downs and ups over the last 30+ years, so it's not unrealistic to make this happen--I've done it a couple times before--but I'm getting tired of having to retrench and start over. I feel my age in that respect. And like you, I doubt that I could find a job that pays what I need--and who's hiring someone my age? So I have to make this business work better once again.\n\nWhat I take away from my experience is that I should have sold years ago when we were on an upward path. I didn't because the good times were rolling and I had built my little one-person operation into a high 7-figure, profitable company that had 60+ employees and a million dollars in cash on hand. That would have been a great time to sell. Instead I invested in a product development that I really believed in but that didn't pan out, and kept the company going when things went down. \n\nIf I had made some different decisions, I would be retired now, comfortably. As it is, I can't retire any time in the foreseeable future. Ironically, I've had a number of employees who made it all the way to retirement working in my company--I'm somewhat proud of that, almost like launching my kids in a way. But I don't share in it at this point. \n\nI don't know what the answer is, and in my business a big win can change things considerably. But I can't count on that and my runway seems shorter, and I should have become more risk-adverse with respect to putting money away rather than investing in the business--which I saw as investing in myself. That was a mistake. Those are two separate tracks. I'm in the process of figuring it out and, unlike running my business, this all seems new and not comfortable. \n\nI don't know if any of this is helpful, except maybe to say you're not alone.",

All 3 of my original partners have moved on to other things, but as a director/editor I’ve always been the most in demand. I would not be able to make nearly as much money in-house somewhere. So I press on wearing lots of hats and with a stable of freelance collaborators.\n\nAI is a tool. It is going to be used to save time and money (already cutting out transcription/translation turnarounds and scanning through footage in seconds) but the need for content is going nowhere. Brands that take themselves seriously will continue to spend money on advertising content. Someone will need to be behind the curtain using all of the tools available to create.\n\nAnd brands want to work with someone they can trust to manage a project from start to finish with all the bumps along the way as well as execute. Hard to come by in my experience. I’ve also seen companies “save money” this year by working only “in-house” and then just white labeling with us. This has meant less competitive bidding, and has worked out well.\n\nBeing a creative who keeps the books, runs payroll, handles insurance, manages the office/equipment/crew with a smile is unique. It sounds like you being a lot to the table. Find the opportunities at each brand/agency/org where you can add value. I even did payroll-only for $500k in work for a friend that’s in-house at a big brand because their AP is such a mess that they were losing vendors.\n\nWhen things were dead at the beginning of the year due to tariff fears, I called all of my contacts and asked them what their needs were. Since June it’s become our second best year ever. Plenty of factors out of our control, but if you were full time you’d have to be worried about layoffs, so try to use your strengths and experience to fill clients needs whatever they may be. Easier said, but I’ve been on the rollercoaster for a long time now and I’m still optimistic about the future of our industry. Good luck!",

The most you can really do to get them back is retarget them with paid ads.\n\nIf you're losing 49 out of 50 people anyway, but you convert 10% or more of visitors into email subscribers, well now you have 5 or more high-intent potential customers that you can market to forever (until they unsubscribe).\n\nIt may be worth losing 1 buyer in the short term to gain 5.  And considering they typically offer a discount or something with the email submit, that may also increase their overall conversion rate.\n\nIt'll be different for all products and all sites in terms of how it actually works out, but I'm sure that's the theory behind it :).",
