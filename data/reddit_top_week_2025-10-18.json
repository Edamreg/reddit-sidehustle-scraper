      "selftext": "So I started a lawn care business a little over a month ago (proof on my post history) and ended up scoring 25 clients in one month from leaving door hangers \n\nI worked on a realtors lawn and she was complaining to me about how people park in her 5 acre lot without permission during a very popular event in my city during October. And she offered me $50 to drive there, dig a hole and leave a sign that said ‚Äúprivate property, no trespassing, property is under surveillance 24/7‚Äù so I can tell she REALLY didn‚Äôt want people on her property. \n\nSo instead of accepting the job I offered her to manage the parking lot and charge people for parking and we can split the money. We agreed on 50/50.\n\nFast forward a few days ago , I paid for a few signs and printed pages saying ‚Äúparking $10‚Äù which only costed me a few bucks. \n\nWent there at 1pm and started charging people $10 each for parking. I made $5 for every car that passed \n\nAfter 4 hours charging people non stop I made a total of $4,700 in just parking fees, minus $100 in set up costs. $4,600 profit split between the property owner and took myself $2,300 home today. I am going to do this for 3 more Saturday‚Äôs to pull in some serious dough.\n\nGonna use my profit to buy a nice truck cash for my lawn care business. \n\nOpportunities are out there, is there a chance that you‚Äôre going to do the exact same thing I did and replicate my success? Most likely not but what does help is having the mind of a hustler and noticing dollar bills when people are in pain. ",

So a few days later, I did my own research (im careful, but i think that's for the best) and more and more i realized how the whole thing worked. Because you hedge any bets you place, you are always making sure you have all of the outcomes covered so technically you can't lose and I know it sounds too good to be true but really it's just math. And then you use sportsbook promos to extract actual money. It's not a get rich quick thing but that's not what i was looking for, just wanted a small hustle i can pick up whenever i have time and not worry about it.",

      "selftext": "I‚Äôm an Automotive Technician with over two decades of experience.  I‚Äôve always worked for a dealership, but recently formed my own business on the side.  I went through all the legalities of doing it the correct way; where I registered with the state and county that I‚Äôm in, got my EIN, and opened a business account.  Once it was all set up, I made a website, leased an office space and started advertising on social media.\n\nIt started out slowly‚Äî after the first 30 days I was questioning whether it was even worth it.  I barely made enough that month to cover business expense.  However, it began to snowball after I landed some mid-tier jobs and started to get 5 star reviews on Google.  Consistent advertising through instagram fueled the fire, while creating content on YouTube on the cars I was working on showcased my skills.\n\nFast forward today and after a short 7 months in operation, I‚Äôve managed to build roughly $38k in business capital‚Äî all net profit.  The jobs I‚Äôm landing are also getting bigger.  I‚Äôm billing out dealership-level work orders and gaining repeat clients to boot.  Most recently; I performed a major engine overhaul on a clients car that was billed out at nearly $7k.  A week later he dropped his other car off with me to get it up to snuff on maintenance and any other repairs it needed.\n\nAs the work becomes consistent, I‚Äôm finding it difficult to juggle both the W2 and my own ‚Äúside business‚Äù‚Ä¶ which as of late I consider more of a full time business than anything‚Äî as all of the free time I have outside of the W2 is dedicated to building the business and scaling it up.  I know at some point, I‚Äôm going to have to choose between the two and I‚Äôm already strategizing how that will play out.  If things continue to accelerate at the pace that it has been, I see myself making the side hustle my main hustle and just picking up a part time job as a bartender or something‚Ä¶ start networking and gaining clients that way.\n\nWhen I formed this business, I had my doubts on whether it would amount to anything.  Now I‚Äôm proud of what it has become and excited to see what it will eventually be.  \n\nBest advice I can give anyone that‚Äôs thinking of starting something on the side is this:  \n\n‚Ä¢Identify what you do best, and capitalize on that and that alone. (I‚Äôm a Mechanic‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt make sense for me to open a food truck).\n\n‚Ä¢Be prepared and put systems in place to keep you organized- keep your books tight.\n\n‚Ä¢Realize there will be monetary risks.  Start small, budget wisely, and don‚Äôt get over leveraged.\n\n‚Ä¢You will make mistakes- learn from them.\n\n‚Ä¢Don‚Äôt chase $, chase client satisfaction and those 5 star reviews.\n\n‚Ä¢The reward reflects the time and effort put in.\n\nHope this was interesting and that it inspires some people.  üîß \n\n",

      "selftext": "I used to treat tools like toys, fun to play with, but not serious. I‚Äôd mess around for a bit, close the tab, move on. But somehow, a few of those random things ended up quietly making me money.\n\nHeyEtsy was one of the first. I only even bothered opening it because someone mentioned it in some random Reddit thread. This thing actually shows you what's really selling, not just what's, like, all over your feed. I started using it to just peek at the real numbers before I wasted another 10 hours designing totally random crap. That tiny shift literally saved me from launching a dozen flops.\n\nThen came CheckEtsy basically, it tells you which keywords actually convert. Not ‚Äútrending,‚Äù not ‚Äúhyped,‚Äù but selling. That‚Äôs how one of my listings accidentally became my top earner. Not because I was smart, I just followed the data for once.\n\nIdeogram and Midjourney completely blew my mind, too. Instead of literally slaving away for hours designing from scratch, I could just pump out a bunch of concepts in minutes, pick the decent ones, and quickly clean them up. It wasn‚Äôt even about 'AI magic,' really, it was just about pure speed - getting to the next idea way faster.\n\nAnd this one still kinda trips me out: some random little Google indexing tool I stumbled upon online. It basically made my pages show up on search way, way faster. Nothing fancy, at all, but it was like a secret shield, making sure all the stuff I'd already bothered building didn't just vanish into the internet abyss.\n\nNone of these tools made me rich, obviously. But man, together they just shaved off all the soul-crushing, boring parts and let me actually focus on the fun stuff. They basically kept my side hustle chugging along while I was busy pretending to take breaks.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the one tool that ended up helping you more than you expected?\n\n",

Export them neatly (transparent PNGs, SVGs, etc.) and either sell them on marketplaces or offer them free with ads and a paid tier for extra stuff.\n\nBonus tip: create your own website and sell without a commission.\n\nThere's a big audience of YouTubers, indie devs, and small creators who need quick visual assets but don't have the skill or time to draw. You could turn your skills or past drawings into a simple side hustle.",

      "selftext": "I‚Äôve been digging into what it really takes to turn a blog into a money maker in 2025, and one thing keeps coming up is consistency. If you publish only once in a while, you‚Äôll never build enough momentum for search engines or readers to trust you. It is the bloggers who post weekly or more tend that scale much faster when it comes to traffic. Over time, that regular output compounds into more keywords, internal links, and authority, which are all essential for real income growth.\n\nMonetization usually starts with ads and affiliate links. A good benchmark is RPM, which means revenue per 1,000 pageviews. Currently, I have monetized my blog with Google Ad sense and the RPM usually hovers around $10-15. \n\nLooking at more successful blogs, many now report around $20 to $30 RPM on average across combined ad and affiliate income. For example, 20,000 monthly pageviews at a $25 RPM equals about $500 per month. \n\nOnce you meet traffic thresholds, you can also apply for premium ad networks, which often pays $12 to $30 or more per thousand views. AdSense and similar networks pay differently by region, with traffic from the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. earning much higher rates. As your blog grows, you can add digital products, sponsored posts, or courses. Blogs with multiple income streams can reach $50 to $100 RPM or higher.\n\nThe potential is real. But you need consistent posting, good SEO, and the patience to build authority. If you‚Äôre starting or trying to grow a blog this year, focus on steady publishing, optimizing for high-value countries, and gradually improving your monetization setup.\n\nIf you have any questions about monetization and the likes, let me know.

Ask me anything you want to confirm.) \n\nIt‚Äôs a walking app.  You don‚Äôt need to spend tons of time on it, but it won‚Äôt make you rich either.  It‚Äôs just for a few extra bucks here and there.  You COULD put some time in it and make quite a bit more, but you don‚Äôt have to just to make a few bucks.  \n\nYou just log in at the end of the day and collect your steps with one button push.  If that‚Äôs all you do, it‚Äôll take awhile, but you can still make money.  \n\nThings I do to speed up making money on it now are:\n\n-1 survey a night for like 5 minutes.  They are too boring for me to sit there and bang out, but you could do a bunch if you wanted.  \n\n-collect the ‚Äúcards‚Äù Around town as you walk.  \n     -I do it if I‚Äôm riding passenger in a car.  Just open and and grab the daily seven cards as you pass them on the street lol.  \n\n-very occasionally play a game if it seems fun or they are running a bonus.  \n\n-referrals here and there when I can get them.  \n               -you get points and so does the person entering the code.  \n\n\nI have made 50-75 a month doing this for a bit now.  Not a killer income, but requires very little effort.  \n\nMy referral code is : \n\nPeacefulRhinoceros9144\n\nFull disclosure: I get 100 points and you get 150 points, or ‚Äúwards‚Äù as they are called, once you reach 200 wards on your own.  You could do that the first day too if you did one or two surveys, or just collect your steps at the end of the day but it‚Äôll take a little bit longer.\n\nOne of many apps I run to get low to no effort gift cards or Venmo.  Yes, they do pay out.  It takes like three days or so once you submit your cash out to get the gift card or Venmo.  \n\nHappy to answer any questions too.",

I'd start with something that could make me money immediately.",

Can't code. Advent gamer(if it helps).\n\nHoping for something at home, was first looking for typing or 'email answering' jobs around the net, open whenever to do(could burn midnight oil) but nothing panned out or I just don't know where to look.

Also hired a graphic artist to do all the graphics for my page and the ones used in my videos.  Taught myself Davinci Resolve for video editing as well. After about a year with no success I kinda burnt out.\n\nI started posting a few videos again since last week and views and watch time have started to pick up again.\n\nI plan to release a video every week but does someone have advice on how to grow and promote my channel? In particular how to translate all those views and watch hours into subscribers?\n\nI've already done pretty much everything that is usually listed on Google posts on the topic.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Ask folks what tasks they have been putting off in their houses that you could potentially help with that don't require any real skills or tools that they don't already have. The holidays and New Year's are coming. People feel the stress of having stuff left to do. There are also many elderly people who don't have help and are also lonely.

You are reviewing website designs before they launch. You give feedback on how easy or difficult their pages are to navigate before they release it! If you get up to 5 stars on feedback (very easy) you will be offered more tests. \n\n Pocket7Games- (Code for free money/tickets is sxqgquU) I got really good at a game on this app and genuinely made $200 from two games. It is fantastic just master a skill game.

Spent \\~25 minutes scrubbing a stale coffee smell out of the Prius before a pickup - renter no-showed anyway.\n* Task monkey (chrome extension) - funny enough, I tried it on Amazon October Prime Day last week and it got me like $138 back from price drop. Probably the only thing I'd call \"passive income.\"no link/ not affiliated.\n\nHalf a year in, I don't buy the \"work hard and it‚Äôll click\" thing anymore. Most of this stuff is the same tricks with a new label. You put in hours, spend a little cash, and it stalls out. The only money I saw was small and hands-on.

You don‚Äôt need a huge following or fancy setup, just the right systems and consistency. I joined a community that teaches how to use AI to build those small income streams step-by-step, and it opened my eyes to how much you can actually make from your phone and Wi-Fi.

If you are starting an online business or getting into online work you should know that: 1. you need a proper plan to create a new market, create a completely new job idea; 2. every kind of work that you start up online is a small investment itself, which means you will most probably spend money trying to earn money (im also talking about advertising your product/service/whatever); 3. low effort jobs and no skill jobs are not well paid jobs (not worthwile), you must possess some kind of skill.\n\nDon't listen to Youtubers, try searching around forums and chats online and maybe, but maybe youll get lucky. You need to find a good contact or agency or smth\n\nThe market is oversaturated for most kinds of existing jobs, in order to earn money doing simple work you should travel in time 15 years in the past\n\nTake time doing what youre doing, patience is important, getting a good amount of money in a short period of time (less than a month) is highly improbable\n\nThe last thing is advertise your stuff, be the most annoying you can be with it, share it everywhere\n\nI know all of this advice is well-known stuff already, but im trying to help anyone new who wants to start online, hope i did.

That‚Äôs not how it works.\n\nPassive income isn‚Äôt some magic loophole that prints cash. It‚Äôs the reward for front-loading the hard work putting in the effort *now* so you don‚Äôt have to later. Every person who‚Äôs built something that earns passively has paid in *either time, money, or both.*\n\nIf you‚Äôre starting from $0, that‚Äôs fine but be ready to grind. Learn copywriting, create digital products, start a YouTube channel, build a blog, anything. But if your plan is to do nothing and somehow earn something, you‚Äôre better off buying a lottery ticket.\n\nPeople love the idea of ‚Äúpassive income‚Äù because it sounds effortless. But in reality, it‚Äôs just *delayed effort.*\n\n  \nIs there *any* way to start truly passive income from $0 without investing a single hour or dollar?

Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

I make posts on Reddit, Threads ,FB and Instagram - and people find my content and buy through my links.\n\nIt‚Äôs honestly one of the easiest ways to start online because you don‚Äôt need to be an influencer or have followers.

      "selftext": "I feel like most people on this page don't actually understand what passive income is. By no means am I a pro, but here is what I do. \n\nI live in the Dominican Republic, and have started with a few investments. I have a motorcycle that I bought for $400 and a Tri-moto (basically a three wheeler but has a truck bed in the back of the motocycle.) Which are commonly used to haul building materials, trash, or help people move as well as many other things. The Tri-moto was $3000. Every day, except for Sunday the motorcycle brings in $4 and the Tri-moto brings in  $12. Weekly that is an income of $96, minus the $18 I pay to someone to manage this. So every month I'm making $312 for doing absolutely nothing. \n\nI know it's not much. But it feels great to be getting these systems started. It's about 10% of what I need to live my life, so a good start. The plan now is to save 100% of this until I can get another tri-moto. \n\nFeel like I need to say this because everyone here is always selling a course. Well, I don't have one. Just common sense. Find something someone needs for a job, and rent it to them. Everyone wins. ",

          "body": "Building $3,000 per month in passive income will take time, but it‚Äôs absolutely doable if you focus on the right systems and lean into your strengths.\n\nGiven your experience in IT, Agile, and coaching, one of the best places to start is creating and selling digital products based on your knowledge. That could be templates for project planning, Agile sprint boards, training slide decks, or even Notion or Airtable setups for productivity. You can sell these on Gumroad or Etsy. Once created, these digital products can generate income over time without ongoing work.\n\nYou could also consider launching a small online course or coaching bundle. You don‚Äôt need a big production or a huge audience. Even a short workshop or a focused email course can be sold on platforms like Gumroad or Teachable. With your background, people will pay to learn how to manage projects, navigate Scrum roles, or improve productivity in their own teams.\n\nAffiliate marketing is another path worth exploring. You can earn when someone buys through your link, and this works well when you‚Äôre recommending tools you genuinely use or believe in. The key is to learn how to make persuasive content, whether through blog posts, short videos, or email guides, that helps people make a buying decision. I walk through how to do this step by step in my newsletter if you‚Äôre interested.\n\nGiven your love for cooking and healthy living, you could also create a faceless YouTube channel, digital cookbook, or a healthy meal planner. These kinds of content can be monetized through ads, affiliate links, and digital product sales. It‚Äôs not instant, but over time, it can grow into a reliable income stream.\n\nPrint-on-demand could also complement your creative interests. You can design wellness-themed journals, recipe logs, or even merch with positive messages and sell them on platforms like Printful through Etsy.\n\nYou already have the discipline, knowledge, and mindset. Now it‚Äôs just a matter of choosing one or two paths and going deep instead of wide. I break down each of these ideas with examples and tutorials in my newsletter.

For example:\n\nDigital courses or templates for Agile and Scrum professionals.¬†You can create things like sprint planners, team-building exercises, or short leadership workshops and sell them automatically.\n\nHealthy lifestyle or productivity printables.¬†You already live that life, so share what works for you through planners, checklists, or habit trackers.\n\nAffiliate blogs or newsletters.¬†Start one around self-improvement or healthy living and use affiliate links for tools or books you already recommend.\n\nWorkshops that turn into self-paced products.¬†Host a few short sessions, record them, and sell them later as evergreen content.\n\nThe easiest way to get started is to build one thing that earns $100 a month and then stack it. Thirty small, consistent earners will reach your goal. Focus on creating simple, useful products and automating everything possible.\n\nIt might take a few months to build momentum, but with your mindset and skill set, it is absolutely within reach.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training glfrom beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free! At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

Overnight successes were generally years in the making. There‚Äôs no magic money tree that just makes you wealthy without effort. If you want a magic money tree, you have to find some soil, plant a seed, water it, give it the right nutrients, protect it from storms and the cold and the heat, prune it, and give it time to grow and blossom. Does that sound passive? It‚Äôs not.\n\n2. You have to just pick something and start. The thing you pick should be something that you‚Äôre interested in and have an aptitude for. Instead of consuming everything you can about get rich quick ideas, consume everything you can about the thing you picked. Become an expert.\n\n3. Find a way to start inexpensively. Businesses are generally set up as fixed cost or variable cost. A fixed cost business has expenses every month regardless of what your revenue is. Rent, employee salaries, insurance, etc. A variable cost business generally has costs associated with revenue. If you‚Äôre a reseller‚Ä¶you get orders for a product, collect payment, and then get the product and ship it. Without the order, you had none of those costs. When you are just starting out, try to donut the variable cost way so that you can test the concept without going broke.\n\n3. It won‚Äôt be passive. So find the right Sub to join to talk about working for yourself. Sidehustles or entrepreneur is more appropriate.\n\n4. Starting a business is almost like having a kid. It requires a lot of time, and effort. It‚Äôs not easy, but it can be very rewarding at the same time. But you are committing a significant portion of your time (now and in the future) which comes with sacrifices. \n\n5. Get excited! Because passive income IS possible. It just requires time/effort to build.\n\nGood luck!",

Just focus on creating something useful and getting that first listing live.\n\nOr try print on demand. Sites like Printful let you upload designs and sell them on things like shirts and mugs. You can connect that to Etsy, so you don‚Äôt need to run ads or build a store from scratch.\n\nAffiliate marketing is a great path too, but you need to learn how to make content that actually persuades people to buy. That‚Äôs where most people fail. I explain exactly how to do that in my newsletter.\n\nYouTube is another legit option, even faceless. It won‚Äôt make you rich overnight but once it gains traction, the passive income potential is real through ads, affiliate links, and sponsorships.\n\nIf you want to sell physical products, try dropshipping through eBay. eBay already has traffic, so you don‚Äôt need to waste money on ads. Just learn the basics, pick a product, and get it listed.\n\nFor long-term financial growth, start investing in index funds. It won‚Äôt solve the present, but it builds the future.\n\nMost people who finally started earning didn‚Äôt find the perfect idea, they just took imperfect action. I break all of this down in plain language in my newsletter, no fluff or hype, just step-by-step how to get your first win. Link is in my bio.",

Most of them are just selling guides or courses, and *that's* how they make their money not from the methods they‚Äôre advertising. They prey on people hoping for easy cash, selling info that should honestly be free.\n\nThe truth is, people who are actually making money don‚Äôt usually need to prove it, because they‚Äôre not trying to sell you anything. I‚Äôve personally been making money through affiliate marketing for the past 18 years. It *does* work, but it‚Äôs not instant, and it definitely takes effort to learn and grow.

Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

      "selftext": "ok so for context ive been doing this for about 3 years now. startups bring me in when shit hits the fan - not the \"we ran out of money\" fan, the \"our product literally cannot scale and we have no idea why\" fan\n\nand theres this pattern that shows up EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.\n\nmonth 1-6: everything is great. moving fast, shipping features, customers are happy, lifes good\n\nmonth 7-12: things start slowing down. weird bugs popping up. \"we'll fix it later\" becomes the team motto\n\nmonth 13-18: you literally cannot add a new feature without breaking 3 old ones. every deploy is stressful\n\nmonth 19-24: youve now hired 3 more engineers and theyre just maintaining the existing mess. not building anything new\n\nmonth 25+: rebuild from scratch or watch your startup die in slow motion\n\n**what i found in those 47 codebases:**\n\nlike 89% had zero database indexing. ZERO. your app is slow because youre searching through 100,000 records on every single request. thats not a bug thats just... why\n\n76% were paying for like 8x more servers than they needed. the average is 13% utilization - youre paying for 100 servers and using 13 of them. burning $3k-15k a month for nothing\n\n68% had auth vulnerabilities that would make any security person have a panic attack\n\n91% had no automated tests at all. so every new feature is literally russian roulette\n\n**the math on this is depressing:**\n\navg engineer salary is like $120k right stripe did research showing devs spend 42% of time dealing with bad code so for a team of 4 over 3 years thats $600k+ just... wasted. on maintaining garbage then add $200-400k to rebuild plus 6-12 months of lost revenue during the rebuild total damage per company: $2-3M\n\nand founders dont realize until month 18-24. by then youve raised series A based on growth that is about to completely fall apart\n\n**what actually prevents this:**\n\nhonestly just spend 2 weeks on architecture before writing code. i know its boring and you wanna ship fast but those 2 weeks save you 18 months of hell\n\nthink \"what breaks at 10,000 users\" not \"what works for 100 users\" - your db queries, file uploads, background jobs, everything needs to handle 100x day one\n\nautomate tests from the start. if you cant click one button and know nothing broke youre just gambling\n\npick boring tech. react/node/postgres is boring and thats GOOD. you can hire for it, theres stackoverflow answers, it doesnt randomly die at 2am\n\nget someone whos done this to review your architecture in WEEK ONE. not month 12 when its too late\n\n**the part nobody wants to hear:**\n\nmost technical cofounders and first eng hires are really good at coding but have never architected something that scales. its like being a great cook but never running a restaurant kitchen during dinner rush\n\nreal example from last month - saas company spending $47k/month on aws\n\ni did a 3 day review and found:\n\n* running 40 servers when they needed 6\n* storing files in literally the most expensive way possible\n* db queries taking 4 seconds that should take 40 milliseconds\n\nnew bill: $8,200/month\n\nthey saved $38,800 PER MONTH. thats $465k a year. for 3 days of work.\n\n**why im posting this**\n\nbecause im tired of watching founders burn 18 months and $500k-2M learning lessons that are completely avoidable\n\n\"move fast break things\" works when youre facebook with unlimited money. for your startup its just suicide\n\n**if youre building something right now ask yourself:**\n\n* what breaks at 10x current users?\n* do you have automated tests?\n* can your db handle 100x the queries?\n* would your infrastructure cost $50k/month at 10k users?\n\nif you said \"i dont know\" to any of these youre building on quicksand\n\nhappy to answer questions about tech stack or architecture stuff in comments. ive seen this movie too many times. \n\nMeir Avimelec Davidov (You can search me over linkedin)  \nFounder &amp; CEO of gliltech software",

Feature speed ground to a halt and we ended up with barely used features with crazy complex architectures that imagined that this feature was going to be centre of the future of the platform and was hideously over engineered, where the reality was most features missed the mark and were sidelined as we learnt what users wanted.\n\nAfter all that bullshit, we still needed to rewrite the whole thing about 24 months in as it was too bloated and complex to build on.\n\nI've come to realise that can't it's like the most immutable developer trait. Someone who likes building fast, hates slowing down and doing all the design stuff as they see it as time wasting, when they could be shipping features and someone who loves scalable coding usually thinks the other guys are idiots and they are far superior. You try to get one to do the other and they usually quit rather than do it.\n\nHaving built multiple products from scratch, I'd rather the quick scrappy guys to get started and then layer in some of the other guys as you need to scale. I just try to steer things a little, so scaling isn't too bad but get those guys in too early and your company will die before you get any customers.",

When you give an extremly short and meaningless name, people instinctively add the domain when they mention it. They say \"2pr\\[.\\]io\" instead of just \"2pr\" because saying just \"2pr\" sounds awkward or unclear. (hopefully moderators will get that is not a link but core feature of the post/story)\n\nThat becomes a clickable hyperlink automatically.\n\nMost of our signups come from direct links now. People share the name in Slack channels, LinkedIn comments, Reddit threads. Word-of-mouth converts into clickable links without any extra effort.\n\nMade $4500 last month and a 80% of that came from people just dropping the name in conversations.\n\nIf you're venture-backed with a marketing budget, you probably want a memorable brand name like Mistral or Clay.\n\nBut if you're bootstrapping and need scrappy distribution, super short plus meaningless might actually be a hack.\n\nGeniunly, I can't understand why this growth hack idea is not so widely cited or shared",

I'm not asking from a legal standpoint but I've always found that the people I hire that are most dedicated are also usually the worst at their actual job but also they are the ones most willing to follow a plan laid out for them to fix it. \n\nI've hired plenty of people who were really good at sales as an example (and I know that's a personality itself) and I could get them to sell anything and it was great. However, when something wasn't going right they were the biggest pain in the ass. One time, we didn't have the right business license in this state we were about to do a show in and it was 4:30PM on a Friday, one of my dedicated people (but not good at sales) called up the local license place and they said they had already closed for the day and she went and found a neighbouring town, called them up and begged them to stay open for a few extra minutes took a cab and drove out there and got the license. All without needing me to handhold her and she knew she didn't have time to wait for my permission but she also knew the show wouldn't happen without it. \n\nSo we worked on her weaknesses and I spent extra time training her and eventually just started hiring sales people to work under her because the amount of peace of mind I had with her was still worth it.",

We signed a few big clients, hired more people, and for the first time, we‚Äôre actually profitable. But now it feels like we‚Äôve hit a new kind of chaos. Everyone has cards, subscriptions multiply overnight, and invoices pop up from random tools that nobody remembers signing up for. Last month, I found out we‚Äôd been paying for two different analytics platforms because two departments didn‚Äôt realize they were using the same thing. We‚Äôre not ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù enough to hire a CFO, but I‚Äôm spending way too much time trying to figure out where money‚Äôs going. I‚Äôve tried using Google Sheets and QuickBooks tags, but it still feels like patchwork. For those of you who hit this stage how do you keep visibility without micromanaging? Is there a system that actually works for small but growing teams?",

You can categorize expenses, and you can look at them every month and see what is legit and what isn‚Äôt. Once you tag something, it‚Äôll be categorized properly. But I would say absolutely not everyone should have cards, and every charge should be authorized by someone who is looking at the transactions every month. You can then categorize things like how much should we spend on software, how much did we spend on business meals, how much did we spend on advertising dollars, and then you can see where you need to watch out. This also will help you with your taxes. \n\nOnce you get into a groove, most expenses should be predictable and recurring. This is actually a great use for AI. You can export your transactions and create a project for expense review. For example you have a long list including things like:\n\nAsana\nEverhour\nGoogle Workspace\nSEMRush\nSupermetrics \n\nSo you tell the GPT what to expect and what‚Äôs normal, and then every month you upload it and say tell me what charges are out of the ordinary and anything that‚Äôs changing, something like that.",

Honestly it's just frustrating, Here's hoping that frustration eats me alive enough To push me forward. And just make the move to reach out to a few people,(or a lot of fucking people) And find someone that's willing to actually buy. It does feel like an endless list of things to learn though, Like I seen many people mention Google ads, Running through Reddit forums, finding communities wherever they may be, And selling it to them there. But all I hear when I read that is \"well that's another thing to kind of learn or figure out how to approach\". Alas perhaps that's the entrepreneurial journey, Endless things to learn. but isn't that also a trap.... Anyways sorry for the long comment, good luck to anyone else in a similar boat!",

I keep reminding myself why I am building my start-up. At this point, getting a 'good exit' is not even at the top of the list (although that would be nice!). I have started this to solve a problem and need to see it through.\n\n2.  See if you can build a 'support system' - I have a buddy who is also going through a similar journey and we have agreed to keep talking to each other about our pain points. \n\n3. Listen to your body - at least as a solopreneur, I have some degree of freedom with my schedule. I usually listen to  energetic music when i work or go workout, shower, etc. when I need a break. Sometimes I even take a nap in the middle of the day and then slog it out late in the night. The key is to understand what keeps you in your productive zone most of the time and try to do more of that. High Productivity/Passion =&gt; Less Stress.\n\n4. Have something that you can look forward to. For me, I keep (kept? - more below) my Friday evenings to just unwind with my favorite food and drink. I'm back at it first thing Saturday morning, but Friday evening is my time. Through out the week, I imagine myself sitting on the couch on Friday evening and ask myself 'what do I need to accomplish before Friday, that will help me enjoy it more?' and the work towards that.\n\n5. Go Public! Recently, I went public with my startup on LinkedIn (nerve wracking, yes), but that is driving a new level of accountability that I don't even want to do my Friday ritual anymore (LOL). It is not just the fear of public failure, but also the motivation from listening to people's problems and how I am working to solve those.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nPS: Yes, I have read Tim Ferris' \"4-Hour Work Week\", but haven't truly figured out how to make it work for my situation.",

No, not really. And that was my plan. Here‚Äôs why: I‚Äôm not job-hunting and don‚Äôt position myself as a candidate. I‚Äôm building the reputation of a strong marketer and an engaging storyteller. I think that protects me from offers I‚Äôm overqualified for or simply uninterested in. That said, I have received several great inquiries, ones definitely worth attention, for senior roles, mid-level positions, and personal brand management.\n\nI just write about what interests me. My topics depend on that. If my interests change, maybe my ‚Äústrategy‚Äù will too. Probably more about work, since now I have one.\n\nDid I find a job? I did. I‚Äôm not sure LinkedIn directly helped, but thanks to it, I‚Äôve had side gigs that have totaled about $1,000. That wasn‚Äôt my goal, though.\n\nI didn‚Äôt expect such rapid growth or to reach such high numbers. So far, I‚Äôm satisfied :)\n\nI‚Äôve garnered 3.6 million impressions, gained over 7,000 followers, and written 270 posts, averaging 128 reactions and 30 comments.\n\nOverall impression, I like it.

      "selftext": "All subscription companies eventually figure out the Monthly to Annual Plan pricing trick.\n\nI ran growth at Codecademy from 10M ARR to 50M ARR and this trick probably drove 30% of that growth. \n\nThe trick is to price your 12-month plan to be slightly more than your average LTV for monthly users.   \n  \nSo, if your average user stays around for 4 months, just price your annual plan at 5 months.  \n  \nYou get to boost LTV for these users by 25%, which is a huge win for not a lot of effort.  \n  \nWe did this at Codecademy, and it was hands down one of the most effective tactics we have ever tried.   \n  \nIt shifted a material amount of users to long-term plans, which increases LTV, drops churn, etc.  \n  \n**Also:** The big implication of this is that you can look at any mature subscription business and basically guess their user retention by looking at the ratio between their 12 month and 1 month prices.  \n  \nNetflix: Only offers monthly plans, meaning their average user stays around for over 12 months.  \n  \nHeadspace: $12.99 for a month vs $69.99 for a year. Ratio of 5.39, so their monthly users likely stay around for \\~4 months.   \n  \nCalm: $14.99 for a month vs $69.99 for a year, ratio of 4.67, so their monthly users probably stay around for \\~3-4 months  \n  \nIf you want to see what company in each category is probably the best at retention, look at pricing ratios",

Like ask about feelings, summary, ask about action plans. Etc.\n\nThe client is super happy with it, and they use it daily.\n\nAnswering your question.. the right keyword to look for \"Speaker Diarization\" platforms that will convert Speech-to-text with speakers' detection technology.\n\nGood luck.",

I've seen teams burn $2-3K/mo on GPT-4 calls before realizing they could cache 80% of responses or downgrade to 3.5 for non-critical queries. The profitable AI businesses I've tracked share one pattern: they didn't start as AI companies, they added AI to solve a specific bottleneck in an existing workflow (driver routing, product descriptions, lead personalization). The ones that launched as 'AI startups' without a clear use case usually pivot or die within 6 months. On pricing: the successful ones charge for outcomes or time saved, not per AI call. If you're pricing per generation or query, your margins get crushed every time OpenAI raises prices. Better to package it as 'unlimited X for $Y/month' and manage your own cost efficiency internally.",

I have a master‚Äôs degree in computer engineering from a top 20 university, and even with that, I still had to apply to over 900 jobs before I finally landed my software engineering role. It was months of rejection, silence, and frustration, but I refused to quit.\n\nDuring that time, I launched two mobile apps completely from scratch handling everything from development to design to deployment. None of them went viral, but they taught me more about persistence, problem-solving, and product development than any class ever could.\n\nIf I could give you one piece of advice, it‚Äôs this: don‚Äôt give up. Keep learning, keep building, and keep improving your craft. You never know which project, connection, or opportunity will change your trajectory. Learn financial literacy, understand how to manage what little you have, and treat every setback as a lesson rather than a failure. Progress can be painfully slow, but it compounds over time. Stay patient, stay consistent, and eventually, it all starts to click.",

Open a store and think of ways to sell. This is how you learn to fail but this is also how you succeed. If that didn‚Äôt make you stop, it‚Äôs a good sign. Good luck !",

Local Market Research to find out the workflows, pains and also how they use AI. Google/Talk to AI, find indirect competitors in other markets /global ones that you can copy.\n2. TODO: Analyze a specific local industry (Country/Language). Focus: Which questions should I ask myself?\n3. Call the companies and ask them a series of questions followed by asking them if they would pay for it.\n4. Also ask if it is OK for them if you add them to your CRM-system and contact them when the product is live\n5. By doing this you get a CRM-database with potential customers\n6. Develop the easiest first solution.\n7. Email them and offer them a demo or to test the software.\n8. This makes them feel \"ownership\" over this idea.\n9. This build trusts and you can either deliver the next product or ask them: Would you like this too?\n10. Potentially, with enough trust, and recurring business you could ask for money to develop the issue (Retainer/targeted customer funding).\n\n\\---\n\nMake sure you do versions of the business documents for your project and make new ones until you feel you are ready. Which ones are important?\n\nFor any AI-driven development: What documents should you have finished first, which could be included as skeleton files for the AI to populate.\n\nIf you use AI for help with documents make sure you have a system in place for organization of files.  \nEither do this locally on your computer, with drive or with Notion.\n\nCareful: Making a decision for part in a doc, might require you to change a lot of other docs.  \nMake sure you have your documents mapped out to know how they relate to eachother.   \nThis will help you.",

As we see with the news today, you'll want to create a recession proof business  that will ALWAYS be needed and you can't be laid off from. Think laundrymats, plumbing, HVAC, electrician, UPS stores, etc. These are all things that except for a zombie apocalypse will always be needed. For example, I chose nursing as my career because as long as humanity lives, I'll always have a job, and it's a diverse and scalable field. I would say pick something like that, take an apprenticeship, work your way up and eventually open your own business. I would avoid AI only because the market is changing so fast, it may be difficult keeping updated when self-taught. Don't focus on lots of money fast, PLEASE focus on **sustainability**. Think of the tech startup boom from a few years back and how many people today are laid off.  People have to have clean clothes, lights, working drains, etc. whether the market is up or down. Over the long run of your life, constant, steady, stable and infallible income will bring you more money, and ultimately PEACE OF MIND (as you age, you will realize that this/work-life balance is worth more than anything. Your body/mind won't be 19 forever) than quick fads ever will. Hope this helps!",

I even tried to start two businesses with my friends, but both failed (the first, my friend and I stopped liking the project, and the second one, I was the only one putting in the time, and then I had a burnout) before even having an MVP. I know it's my fault, but I am just saying.\n\nI have around 3 years of software engineering experience and 1 year in sales, since I do it as a side-hustle.\n\nNow I want to go in and build something, but after my burnout, I feel like I am having some trouble having ideas and starting again. And I am afraid of never leaving this wantrepreneur stage.\n\nI don't care about being rich, I just want to build something that helps make people's lives better and be able to maintain the flexibility I have from working remotely.\n\nCan you guys give me some tips on how to leave this stage?",

Standard stuff like lawn maintenance, seasonal cleanups, mulching, the usual.\n\nAbout 8 months ago I had this one client who kept asking if I could pressure wash their driveway while I was already there doing their yard. I said sure whatever, charged them like $75 extra just to not deal with scheduling another visit. Took me maybe 30 mins.\n\nWord got around I guess because then other clients started asking. I figured why not, easy add on right? Fast forward to now and I'm getting calls specifically for pressure washing. Like people don't even want the landscaping part anymore they just want their driveways, decks, house siding done.\n\nDid the math last week and the pressure washing stuff brought in almost double what the landscaping did last month. I've got some money saved up from the busy season and St–∞ke so I could buy better equipment and actually pivot to this full time but it feels weird abandoning what I started with?\n\nAnyone else deal with something like this where a side thing accidentally became the main thing?

These were considered \"throw-away\" devices. They'd last maybe 5 years and then would break somehow and the business owner would have to buy a new one for anywhere from $5k - $12k depending on the brand because no one provided repair services.\n\nSo we offered to try and repair it. We did basically the same thing you did, $100 and we'll try to repair it. We were successful. I wrote a blog post about it on our company website and within a week we started getting calls about the service. It was crazy. We started receiving 10+ calls per day about this service. We completely pivoted our focus to only this service.\n\nTo find our pricing we simply kept on increasing prices until people started pushing back.  So now we charge about $1,200 for a service that costs us a couple hundred to provide.\n\nNow we're nationwide and Repair about 10,000 of these devices per year and growing. Sure there's competitors now, all who have spawned from ex employees, but we're doing great. Totally life changing.",

I offered him a side of fries instead, but he lost his temper and started cussing at me. He claimed I was 'full of shit' and that I had plenty of product, which wasn't true.\n\nAs the owner, I'm used to dealing with difficult customers, but this guy's behavior was unacceptable. I yelled at him to leave and told him not to come back.\n\nI know some of you might think I'm a jerk for cutting him off, but honestly, I feel like he took advantage of my kindness for too long. Has anyone else had to deal with a similar situation? How did you handle it?",

But we're known for our produce (and we're also a SNAP retailer) so it's a necessity. Produce has different phases: A Grade, B Grade, Free Grade, Piggy Grade, and Compost. We don't have enough B Grade to warrant a trip out to a food rescue organization so we started a \"free table\" where we would put unsellable but still edible produce and other items. Folks from all tax brackets would take from the free table but most importantly: food insecure folks could take from it without having to feel awkward about it.\n\nWell this one unhoused guy decided it was his personal buffet and would eat from it all day. I started offering him bags to take anything he wanted to go. He decided that outside of our store was his home. He would try to come in after closing hours to ask for more free food. One time, I was working from inside the locked store (lights were off and blinds were down) and I felt someone staring at me. I looked up and he was bent down so he could stare at me from under the blinds. That was the first time I called the cops.\n\nWe stopped putting out the free produce for a while because he creeped us out so much (for a multitude of reasons). Customers expressed disappointment so when we hadn't seen the creeper for a long while, we decided to bring it back. Well then creeper man got out of jail and resumed his antics. I was setting up the table and ran into him and we had a nice conversation where he seemed sober + thanked me for feeding him. I offered him a to go bag and he informed me that he was planning on hanging out because he likes it in front of my store. I very politely gave a reason for why he should hang out in one of the more comfortable spots in the area and he went ballistic. I tried to deescalate the situation and he threatened to kill me. I called the cops again, got a different officer, who informed me that sometimes people say things they don't mean.\n\nSince the cops don't care about the safety of my team + my neighbors, the free table is gone permanently and the good free stuff goes to the unhoused people in the neighborhood who periodically check in on us to make sure creeper man hasn't been bothering us.",

For example: does this client send things late? Put him deadlines and do follow ups. Invoices are all disorganized? Sure dedicated accounting software can help that. There are tons of tools that can help you with that.\n\n\nSecond thing are boundaries, it's unaceptable that a client forces you to stay awake during those hours, so aware them of that kind of things wich may not seem that relevant to your client's eyes.¬†",

Make sure that you have a policy in there that if there are no receipts, there is no reimbursement - no exceptions.  For me, part of that policy would be to  get away from using any fintech solution for reimbursement.  Paper (or PDF) only and reimbursements are at the end of the month so you can do it all at once. \n\nNext, once you have a process that is written, assign it to an admin person or hire a part-time admin person to take it off your plate.  (The cost of sanity is about $20/hour).  Oversee the admin's work - that will take much less time than doing it yourself - usually less than a third.",

There's no reason you should be the business's sole admin person when you have at least six employees plus yourself.\n\nYou're not just a microbusiness now; you're a moderately chunky genuine small business. Which means that unless you're a super-admin whiz on top of everything else, it's going to make more sense to start farming out some of the BAU of the business. Possibly to an external service, possibly to a part-time admin employee, but basically you're no longer going to be personally tied directly into every single transaction and internal paperwork assessment the business makes; you simply don't have the time it needs any more. Instead, delegate the white-collar grunt work, and look over the summaries.\n\nAnd honestly, congratulations on getting big enough to start needing real SMB internal support.

And I can't get the bookings unless I spend money on marketing. And I don't have money unless I get bookings.\n\nI've spent over $100,000 on SEO \"agencies\" that were essentially BS.\n\nGAds is way different now that it was 8 yrs ago.\n\nI've spent $20k on GAds in the last 6 months and made about $10k from those ads.\n\nAnd this contractor leaving us for cancer surgery makes me think I don't actually have a business anymore.\n\nAm I stuck in sink cost fallacy? Do I actually have a business at all? What do I do if 10yrs experience turns to shit?\n\nI need to voice this out loud and don't want to speak to my wife about it. \n\nNot sure what I'm looking for.

Which make just be too expensive of customer acquisition cost. I think you‚Äôre cooked tbh, as far as growth. \n\nThe changes to the SEO probably killed your whole current growth model. You were likely able to really maximize the bang for your buck under the old structure, and no one except google is going to know for sure why it changed and/or what you can do about it.\n\nYou would not be at all the first to have this problem after a major update. Any time this happens, some companies get crushed. It might be possible to recover, but also possible you just had the perfect mix of whatever factors mattered. As time goes on, people will know better, but then as more people know, they‚Äôll change it again. \n\nSo you can keep spending money on SEO and consultants, but you‚Äôll probably just burn it all. I know there‚Äôs going to be some consulting firm out there that actually has a very good idea of what the changes are, but that‚Äôs going to be impossible to truly determine you‚Äôre going with the right one, except doing it and seeing the results.\n\nSo just comes down to how much money you want to gamble. Could work, could not. \n\nIf your risk tolerance is low, I‚Äôd look at selling your business based on the value of the brand / customer relationships. For all you know some actual large cleaning company might want to buy it, and do the actual cleaning themselves.

Hopefully that kickstarts their ass into gear and they just pay it to keep it from going any further. But if they continue to ignore it or delay payment, file a lawsuit. It's relatively inexpensive and easy if you do it yourself. And then, again, hopefully *that* kickstarts their ass into gear and they just pay it or offer to settle to keep it from escalating to court. If they still won't pay, then it's time to go to court, and for that you need an actual lawyer. You could try to represent yourself but generally that's not a great idea, but if you do hire a lawyer you should know you're probably going to pay as much (if not more) than you recover from the client. If you try to represent yourself, you could potentially recover a lot more of the money for yourself but you're also more likely to lose.\n\nThey probably have limited cash with which to pay their vendors right now. The squeakiest wheel gets the grease first, and right now you're not one of their squeakiest wheels. In other words, they're only paying the bills that are causing them the biggest problems right now. And you're not one of them. So if you want to get your money, you have to make your bill one of the ones that's causing them the most problems.",

I would not be inclined to go the legal route without one.\n\n1.  Does the contract say anything about recovering attorney's fees?  If Yes, then send a demand letter, reference that section in the contract and make it clear that on mm/dd/yyyy this matter is getting turned over to your attorney and the legal fees that \"YOU Mr. Client will be responsible for,\" start adding up.  If No, then now is the time to add that language to your contracts going forward.  I would still send the demand letter and note that you will be seeking attorney's fees, just be a little less specific about the details.  Whether or not you actually CAN recover such costs at the end of the day is a question for your attorney.\n\n2.  Does the client have assets?  Can they be made to pay up if you win?  Only $14k, I would expect so, but if not, it might not be worth the bother because you could get a settlement and not be able to collect anything.  If Yes to both 1 and 2, then hand it off to an attorney to go after them for the $14k plus costs.  If No to 1, but Yes, to 2, then you just gotta make a judgement call.  I'd figure legal expenses would be $5k minimum if it ends up actually going to court.  You could probably get away with less if a lawyer's demand letter or the court filing itself is enough to get them to pay up.  I think it's worth doing, but you have to understand that you might be throwing good money after bad.  Court is always an expensive gamble.\n\nMost deadbeats will pay up once you actually file in court.  Some will just ignore it, never respond, and never show up at court.

You can appeal and wait 30 days.‚Äù\n\nNo reason given.\n\nNo summary of their decision.\n\nNo timeline to recover my funds.\n\nResult:\n\n\\- ‚Ç¨50,000 frozen\n\n\\- Business operations halted\n\n\\- Dozens of detailed emails ignored, no clear response\n\n\\- My opinion after this experience\n\nWise is no longer a reliable solution for professionals.\n\nThey act like a bank ‚Äî but without transparency, accountability, or logic.\n\nTheir compliance team feels robotic, demanding contradictory and absurd documents, often impossible for small businesses to provide.\n\nAnd the worst part: they can shut down your account without warning, even if your file is clean.\n\nHonestly, it‚Äôs shameful.\n\nI regret ever trusting them.\n\nIf your business relies on Wise ‚Äî withdraw your funds while you still can.\n\n‚ùìQuestions for the community\n\nHas anyone else here had their Wise account closed with money stuck inside?\n\nHow long did it take before you got your funds back?",

          "body": "Yes! Leadership in general is a muscle that needs to grow in the beginning but firing is always hard. My mentor always said the day firing is easy is the day you shouldn't be a leader. You need to make the right decision for your business but it's not easy knowing that person is losing their job. Especially in a small business, you more than likely know their family or at least know about them.  We should always maintain our compassion.\n\nThis is probably my driving force behind hiring very carefully, because I haaaate terminating. I like using interview guides with predetermined questions and 1-3 answer ratings so I'm very clear on who I need to hire and my notes are the data to back them up. I like pretty much everyone when I meet them and the interview is the best you're going to get.  I never hire on the spot and typically try to have someone else I trust in the interview for additional perspective.  I always give myself time after the interview to really think through their answers.\n\nI have seen so many things go wrong when clients wait to fire too. They put it off and every single time, it ends in a dumpster fire. Property damage, reputation with vendors or customers destroyed, workmans comp injuries- I've heard/witnessed some wild stories. \n\nKeep performance notes so you can make an educated decision and have regular performance conversations with your employees so it's not a surprise. This also keeps your top employees happy because seeing poor behavior or poor performance tolerated will demotivate them right out the door.",

That nagging feeling is usually right. By the time you consciously recognize someone isn't working out, the evidence has been piling up for weeks. Waiting for improvement rarely works because the core issue is usually fit, not skill. The \"feeling stupid for the poor hiring decision\" part keeps people stuck longer than necessary. Admitting the hire didn't work out and moving on is cheaper than spending months hoping it gets better while your business suffers. \n\nHow long do you typically wait now between recognizing someone isn't working out and actually letting them go?",

It's why just when inflation was easing all the premiums shot up: All the material &amp; labor cost increases finally hit their actuarial models. Insurance is also seen by most folks as secondary or superfluous. It's transferring risk after all, it's a bill you pay for hypothetical returns. My industry is also deserving of a fair amount of criticism, which leads to folks having a sour attitude towards my profession, in general.\n\nFirst I imagine it'll be auto insurance that'll see the hit. Not many states really track if you have it or not, and when it comes down to pennies that's an easy thing to cut. Homeowners insurance in several states will continue to rise as natural disasters become more common and their repairs more expensive.

I work for IT in a construction company. We have warehouses, remote teams, contractors, all that chaos.\n\nWe're using AssetSonar to track every hardware and software asset.

AssetSonar also helps track license compliance which is huge if you've O365 or Adobe suites your employees are using.\n\nWe switched to it about a year ago and it immediately exposed a ton of ghost devices and duplicate records that were invisible in Excel. Once everything was normalized, audits stopped being a nightmare.\n\nIf you just need something quick to pilot, they do have a free trial.

If your relationship is good, there's no reason why it should get worse when you start working together :)\n\nThe most difficult part is probably dividing work from personal life. If you don't pay attention, you might end up discussing work all the time (it's very easy when you live together) and leaving aside the \"romantic\" part of your relationship.\n\nI think you should definitely try it out with your partner!

Not just their own business, by doing something that had nothing to do with tires directly. \n\nIf more people travel; then more people buy tires. And market share is market share. \n\nTake a wide step back from your business and think bigger.\n\nWhat triggers people to buy your product (or your competitors). What actually drives them to purchase?\n\nThink about the purchase as a process and figure out where there is room for your version of the Michelin guide. \n\nIf you sell dog poop bags, you need to find ways to encourage dog owners to go out with their dogs more.\n\nIf you sell apples you need to encourage people to bake more apple pie. \n\nStop selling your product, and start giving people valuable information, guides, tutorials that seemingly have nothing to do with your product but ultimately lead them to it.\n\nBuilding active readers is a monetary gain itself.\n\nFigure out what your annual  ‚Äúmarket share‚Äù is with your $200k revenue, and find a way to move the market up as whole. The percentage will stay the same for your retention, and you‚Äôll have more revenue.",

          "body": "Three years stuck at the same revenue means you've got a retention problem, not an acquisition problem. You're churning customers as fast as you're bringing them in, which means either your product isn't sticky enough or you're targeting the wrong people.\n\nWellness products need repeat purchases to grow. If customers buy once and disappear, you don't have a business, you just have expensive one-time transactions. Our clients in wellness who broke through this plateau focused obsessively on getting customers to buy 2-3 times, not just converting new people.\n\nYour online sales dropping 30% from peak is a red flag. That's not normal fluctuation, something changed. Did you stop doing what was working? Did ad costs spike? Did a competitor launch? You need to diagnose what actually caused that drop instead of just accepting it.\n\nReleasing new products when your existing ones aren't retaining customers is just spreading yourself thinner. Fix retention on what you already have before you add complexity. Get your current customers buying more frequently or in higher amounts.\n\nThe storefront gives you an advantage most online wellness brands don't have. Use it to build real relationships with local customers who become regulars. Those people should be your core base that stabilizes revenue even when online fluctuates.\n\nFor breaking past $200k, you need either way better retention so your customer base actually grows instead of staying flat, or you need to increase average order value so the same number of customers generate more revenue. Pick one and focus there for 6 months.\n\nCheck your numbers honestly. What's your repeat purchase rate? If it's under 30%, that's your problem. What's your customer lifetime value? If people only buy once for $50, you can't profitably scale. Fix those fundamentals before you worry about growth tactics.",

Sharing so maybe someone else avoids this stuff.\n\nFirst mistake was thinking I could handle all the marketing myself. Spent 6 months posting on instagram and running terrible facebook ads. Burned through 15k with almost nothing to show for it. Finally hired someone who knew what they were doing and sales tripled in two months. I should have done that from day one but I was being cheap and thought I could learn it myself.\n\nSecond mistake was going with the cheapest manufacturer. Saved like 30 cents per unit but quality was garbage. Return rate was almost 15 percent and the negative reviews killed us. Took 8 months to recover our reputation after switching to a better supplier. That 30 cents ended up costing me probably 50k in lost sales and returns.\n\nThird one I just learned about this year. Got a legal letter about our website not being accessible to disabled people. Had no idea this was even a thing. The lawyer wanted 20k to settle and we had to scramble to actually fix the site. Apparently this happens to a lot of small ecommerce companies and nobody talks about it until it happens to them.\n\nEach of these felt like they came out of nowhere but looking back there were warning signs I just ignored. The manufacturer thing especially, I knew the quality wasn't great but kept making excuses.\n\nDoes anyone else have surprise expenses from stuff you didn't know you needed to worry about?",

I got the quote and, being the budget-conscious small business owner I am, I decided to cut the soft costs.\n\nThe manufacturer‚Äôs itemized quote was:\n\n* **Custom Sign Fabrication (with free delivery):** $3,000\n* **Permit Filing &amp; Management:** $900\n* **Nationwide Installation &amp; Project Management:** $1,800\n* **Total Quote:** $5,700\n\n**The Reality was a Disaster:**\n\n1. **I Ordered First:** The beautiful $3,000 sign was made and shipped.\n2. **The Permit Rejection:** I took a day off to file the permit. The city rejected it instantly. They had a hyper-specific height and distance code for the type of sign I chose that I completely missed. The sign was illegal.\n3. **The True 'DIY' Cost:** I had to pay the original manufacturer another **$4,000** to completely tear down, re-fabricate a smaller sign, and expedite the new process. This was on top of the original $3,000 I already spent.\n\n**The Final Bill:** My $3,000 sign ended up costing me $7,000 (plus a 6-week delay to my grand opening).\n\n  \n**THE LESSON I WISH I'D LEARNED:**\n\n* The fabrication cost is the *least* complicated part. The $2,700 for the permit and install management was cheap insurance.\n* **That money isn't just for labor; it‚Äôs for expertise.** A national provider knows the thousands of different local codes across the U.S. and designs the sign to meet your permit requirements *before* production even starts.\n\nIf you are buying anything custom that needs city approval, **pay the full-service fee.** It‚Äôs the easiest $2,700 you'll ever spend. Learn from my mistake!\n\nWhat other hidden costs or required permits did you guys accidentally skip that came back to haunt you?\"",

Most sign companies, when applying for a permit on behalf of the customer, won‚Äôt begin production until the permit is officially approved. Even with plenty of experience navigating local regulations, I‚Äôve still run into situations where a permit gets denied because of some strange interpretation of the rules by someone in the permitting office. Even when the permit office is mistaken, it can take weeks or months to get things sorted out. I've even had some customers who had to hire a lawyer to sue the town over how they interpret the rules.  I know of two towns with nearly identical sign codes that interpret and enforce them completely differently. In one town, the permit office won‚Äôt approve a sign permit until every other required permit is approved first. So even for those of us who deal with sign permitting regularly, the process can still be confusing.",

While our financial performance appears to be satisfactory on paper and operationally, we continue to incur a monthly loss of approximately $16,000.\n\nOur weekly sales exceed $45,000, with a gross profit margin of approximately 64% and a wage expense of 28%. However, the primary contributor to our financial challenges is the substantial amount we allocate to delivery aggregators. This month, despite a total sales of $237,000 (representing five weeks according to the retail calendar), we incurred approximately $37,000 in payments to Uber and DoorDash.\n\nDespite these substantial sales figures, we persist in operating at a loss. Given our limited capacity as a franchise, what strategies can I implement to improve our financial situation? \n\nEdit: Another problem is, I have a gym next door and we have a shared drive-way with them. The gym customers take all the parking spots, even they park on the driveway. This makes it extremely difficult for drivers to-thru customers. My google review is full with people cursing gym folks for their bad parking practices. I get only 400 cars per week in my drive-thru as opposed to 1700 in a drive-thru of another store situated in quieter road than mine. ",

Offer a small discount for direct orders (still cheaper than 28% commission).\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Delivery zone optimization\\*\\* - Are you delivering too far? Tightening your radius can cut delivery times and costs. Most customers order within 3km anyway.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Minimum order value\\*\\* - If you're not already doing this, set minimums that make the economics work. Better to lose a $15 order than subsidize it.\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Ghost kitchen model\\*\\* - Some franchises are shifting to delivery-only locations with lower overhead. Could you test a smaller, cheaper location for delivery orders only?\n\n\n\n5. \\*\\*Negotiate with aggregators\\*\\* - At your volume, you have leverage. Many will reduce commission if you commit to exclusivity or higher volume.\n\n\n\nThe real question: What's your customer acquisition cost through aggregators vs other channels?

The brutal math here is that youre paying roughly 15.6% of total revenue just to delivery aggregators, which when combined with your 28% labor costs is eating up almost half your gross profit before you even touch rent, utilities, or other overhead. What most franchise owners dont realize is that you can actually negotiate better rates with these platforms once you hit certain volume thresholds, plus theres consolidation software that can help manage multiple platform orders through one system so you dont miss orders during peak times. At vGrubs we work with restaurants to aggregate all their delivery platforms into one dashboard and help optimize their delivery operations to actually turn those orders profitable instead of just break-even customer acquisition tools.\n\nThe parking situation is probably costing you way more than the delivery fees though since drive-thru customers typically have much higher profit margins than delivery orders.",

We work with tons of restaurants at Kea AI and that 15-16% you're paying to delivery platforms is just insane when you're already operating on thin margins. The math just doesn't work for most places.\n\nHere's what I've seen work for similar situations. First, you gotta start building your own direct ordering channel aggressively. Since you're on a busy roadway with good drive-thru traffic, focus on converting those customers to order direct next time. Simple stuff like receipt inserts with a discount code for direct orders, or even just training staff to mention \"next time you can skip the wait and order ahead on our app.\" The goal is getting people off those expensive platforms gradually.\n\nSecond thing is optimizing your phone orders since thats free revenue. Make sure every call gets answered professionally because missed calls during lunch rush are literally money walking away. A lot of places lose thousands just from unanswered phones when they're busy. Even something as simple as a proper phone system that queues calls instead of going to voicemail can help capture more of that direct business.\n\nThe delivery platforms aren't going anywhere but you dont have to be completely dependent on them. Start tracking what percentage of your sales come from each channel and set a goal to reduce that delivery platform percentage by even 5% over the next few months. With your volume that could save you almost $1000 monthly. Small changes add up fast when you're doing $45k+ weekly.",

          "body": "As a former franchise owner, I understand the 37k fee is significant. However, it is less than 16% of your sales. At this stage of your career, I believe it is reasonable. I previously managed a business with 60% sales via delivery partners, which resulted in a 22% fee. Consider ways to improve sales, such as extending trading hours. Additionally, discuss with the gym staff to address the drive-through issue. I would also suggest reducing your labour costs to 23‚Äì25%. Evaluate your current sales and determine if you can increase them while employing more junior staff to reduce labour rates. Finally, negotiate your royalty and marketing fees, which I believe are also approximately 10%.  \n\nRegarding gross profit, I believe your cost of goods sold is 36%, This figure appears unusually high. Could you please confirm this and determine if there is a possibility of reducing it to under 30%? Are there any price adjustments required or is waste a significant issue?",
