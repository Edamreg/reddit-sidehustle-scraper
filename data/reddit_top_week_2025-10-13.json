      "selftext": "So I started a lawn care business a little over a month ago (proof on my post history) and ended up scoring 25 clients in one month from leaving door hangers \n\nI worked on a realtors lawn and she was complaining to me about how people park in her 5 acre lot without permission during a very popular event in my city during October. And she offered me $50 to drive there, dig a hole and leave a sign that said “private property, no trespassing, property is under surveillance 24/7” so I can tell she REALLY didn’t want people on her property. \n\nSo instead of accepting the job I offered her to manage the parking lot and charge people for parking and we can split the money. We agreed on 50/50.\n\nFast forward a few days ago , I paid for a few signs and printed pages saying “parking $10” which only costed me a few bucks. \n\nWent there at 1pm and started charging people $10 each for parking. I made $5 for every car that passed \n\nAfter 4 hours charging people non stop I made a total of $4,700 in just parking fees, minus $100 in set up costs. $4,600 profit split between the property owner and took myself $2,300 home today. I am going to do this for 3 more Saturday’s to pull in some serious dough.\n\nGonna use my profit to buy a nice truck cash for my lawn care business. \n\nOpportunities are out there, is there a chance that you’re going to do the exact same thing I did and replicate my success? Most likely not but what does help is having the mind of a hustler and noticing dollar bills when people are in pain. ",

I usually grind the task while on the bus, before sleep. Got 10-15usd per day. Enough for quick meal.\n\nIf you’d like to use my Referral Code for AttaPoll, my code is “QJZJU” and we’ll both get 50c when you sign up!",

You pay an hourly fee and rent a grandma to go with you and skip lines at the bank or supermarket or whatever.. snacks are included\n\n \n- Google lens kind of app specialized in translating doctors handwriting\n \n\n- stray cat’s and dogs printing system. You would print ads in their fur so they go around town showing it off. The money would helo paying for sterilization and other vet bills for them. \n\n \n- lazy food brand - food for people too lazy to prepare it. Cookies already pre-socked in milk; nachos pre-covered in guacamole, pre-sliced oranges, etc\n\n \n- make religious “p0rn” movies - an electrician that enters a client’s house barefoot with a power drill in hand to fix a tv, while the client is a pretty woman in only a bath robe (like most movies of the kind), but the plot twist is that he really just fixes the tv, they pray together a few minutes and part their ways, no funny business.\n\n \n- tinder app for elderly people. Instead of the current tinder like/dislike mechanic, in works like uber and just connects them to the nearest available option.\n\n \n- poop gamification. A smart toilet where you login each time and compete with friends to see who poops the most in a week, or the heaviest. In my head and with the right skills, you could maybe even play poop battleship with friends\n\n \n- brown emergency lights (like the blue ones police attached to cars roofs in the movies) for when you need to get home fast to poop\n\n \n\nPs: I usually get my ideas at night when I suffer from insomnia, so some might be a bit delusional.. imagine the fun I had reading them in the morning though :)\n \n\nPS2: if any of you can get any of these ideas working, update me, I’d love to see it ahah",

People make bad decisions when the are desperate.  I suggest getting more curious.\n\nSTOP CHASING THE OPPORTUNITIES JUST FOR THE MONEY:   In 2010 a food plant I worked at closed its doors.  I know a guy who wanted to go into nursing because of the money.   He had worked at that plant from the day he graduated from high school until it closed.   So rushing into any business idea without out studying it first will guarantee failure.   Pet sitting for example might sound great however there are downsides to everything.   Animal's personalities are as varied as humans.   I grew up on farm with horses, cows, a pig, chickens,  dogs and cats.  \n\nSELF - EVALUATION:   What skills do you have including hobbies?  Write them down.   Take a few days to really think about them.    Also write down your weakness.    Is there opportunities there?    \n\nOPPORTUNITY EVALUATIONS  Do you need any licenses or insurance to operate?    For example, what happens if a pet dies or attacks a neighbor while under your care?  What is your Liability?    Do you see or have you heard about a possible opportunity that isn't being fulfilled already?    \n\nMost  get the cart before the horse.   In their thinking -  I need money so what can I do to get money.    Where a better way is to look in your area or world wide,  is there a niche I can fill that people will pay me for.   In the book Side Hustle that is what the people in the book did.  \n\nGET EDUCATED:   Learn accounting,  management skills,  communication skills, and whatever skills you are going to need to do the side hustle.   Learn content creation -  blogs and video  especially.   Content Creators  if the production is good can make good money. \n\nWhatever you start, think about scale ability.    Starting out you will have to keep your job.   At some point you might want to go full time as a business.  \n\nJust my two cents worth.  LOL",

AI can tell the story if you must, but it cannot do the creative side! \n\nThe second skill is creating an ebook cover. You’ll need a simple Canva or Photoshop tutorial for that.\n\nThe third (it’s not marketing) is meta. You must know how to publish correctly. This is tags, keywords, the story description itself, etc. \n\nIf you can do all three, great, you have the potential of $1k/mo+ minimum if you give this hell. I see a lot of amateurs make a lot of money in here, but that’s not really what it’s about. That’s the 1% doing full time, etc.\n\nYou’d likely start and put in an average of an hour a day. That would come out to an ebook going live maybe 2-3x a week, even more once you have the system down. \n\nDouble down on wins, let the losses go and learn what does and does not sell. As you get better with the above skills, you’ll make more. And, sales from stories layer.\n\nWhen you stop publishing, maybe 20% sales will stay, passive, continuing to sell. I’m over a decade in now and haven’t published to my catalog yet this year. \n\nMy recommendation is to first learn, then second try. Do not try first. This is nsfw art and there are rules and regulations. There are no three strikes because if you mess up, you’re likely done with that platform.\n\nAnyways, if you’d like to know more, you’re welcome to check out my profile. I have a discord server with info and some tips, and a critique area for stories and cover art. You can also advertise your new stories to my core audience of smut buyers and readers. Lots of new authors hanging out, and elder authors like myself as well.\n\nThis year helping new authors get going has been wild. It has spawned even a new ebook store I created. Being in the biz so long and a web dev, I couldn’t help but fill in what I see wrong with the industry. It’s not a lot of money, but so far there’s a handful of authors making grocery money at least!\n\nRighto, it is now very late and I am to bed. Welcome to check out my profile, join discord, read the how to, hang with the community and ask questions. We all love to share our sales, so there is a dedicated spot for everyone to throw up their monthly sales. 😀",

Low cost to enter, you can practice at your own home, and you can start off offering cheaper pricing letting customers know you are starting out and looking to offer affordable options to allow you to practice and still make some money. \n\nA good quality squeegee, window mop, bucket and dawn soap will run you maybe $100. You can charge $100 easy for interior window cleaning. \n\nYou cam advertise on local Facebook groups or make basic lawn signs to get started.\n\nGoodluck!! Hope you find what you need!!",

Starting next semester, around December-January, I will be commuting to my campus all 5 days of the week, and will only be able to work my part-time job 2 days a week (12-15 hrs/week).\n\nI have a little over $10k in my savings, and I am currently trying to save up to move out of my parent’s house in the next 2-4 years. My paychecks now are usually $550-$650 every 2 weeks, but this will decrease immensely for those few months of being busy with school. \n\nWhat are some ways that I can make $200-$400 or more extra a month (Already do DoorDash, but even then I won’t have much time to do that next semester)?  \n\nEdit: I appreciate all replies , though I’d like to mention I prefer non-AI related ideas. Thank yall :) ",

      "selftext": "I remember being obsessed with ads when I first started. It felt like the only way to get anywhere, boost this, target that, maybe something hits. \n\nIt never did. The clicks went up, my wallet went down.\n\nAfter a while I just snapped. I killed everything, every campaign, every “plan.” I figured if nothing worked anyway, at least I’d stop setting my cash on fire. So I started posting whatever felt easy: some random designs on Etsy, a few half-finished ideas sitting on my laptop, nothing special.\n\nThen one of them sold. A tiny order, but man, it felt way bigger than it was. I threw up a few more listings, and somehow the ones I barely touched started selling more than the ones I’d spent hours on.\n\nPinterest was another absolute fluke. I'd made a few pins like, ages ago, never even bothered to optimize them, literally completely forgot they existed. Months later, I just randomly peeked out of curiosity and saw they were still sending people to my shop. Legit free eyeballs, somehow. Blew my mind.\n\nPinterest was another absolute fluke. I posted a couple quick pieces about what I was learning, didn’t push them anywhere, but they just kept popping up again and again. Each time they did, a few bucks showed up in my account like pocket change from nowhere.\n\nThen the whole AI craze hit. I tried a couple tools to remix trending designs into my own style. They made everything look fresh again and, I swear to god, they weirdly out-sold my 'perfect' versions that I'd slaved over for days. Go figure.\n\nNone of this made me rich, don't get me wrong. It just stacked up, a sale here, a few bucks there, until 'no ads' didn't mean 'no money.' I still honestly don't really get why just chilling out and letting things happen worked better than trying so hard, but hey, maybe that's the whole damn point.",

This is how my brother made extra cash, it eventually led him to doing handyman repairs, then him getting his carpenters ticket, and now he owns his own business building houses. All you need is a little muscle, a solid understanding of how to use a ladder safely (1:4 ratio, for every 4 feet of height, your ladder needs to be 1 foot away from the building. Don’t over reach, etc. I’m sure you know all this) hope this helps!

With the whole AI boom happening, it feels like no one’s giving fresh grads a chance. I’ve applied to a ton of jobs, but either I don’t hear back at all, or I’m just not shortlisted. I’ve also tried some data annotation gigs and other side jobs, but honestly, the pay is so low, and the work doesn’t seem worth it. I’m tired of grinding through apps and microtasks that barely pay anything, and I just need something that feels like it respects the effort I’m putting in.\n\nI’m looking for a remote side hustle that pays decently and allows me to put in the work without getting burned out. I’m open to learning new things and willing to put in the time, but I just need something that values my time and effort and actually provides a reasonable return. I’m not looking for something that requires years of experience, but I do want something where I can develop skills and get paid fairly. If anyone has any legit side hustles, remote gigs, or freelance work that they think might be a good fit, I’d really appreciate any suggestions!\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

Find products your audience already talks about or asks for and drop Amazon Associates or ShareASale links. If your pages are niche-specific even better - reach out to brands directly for commission deals.\n\nDigital products take time to create but if you know your audience well it's worth it. Even something simple like a $7-15 PDF guide or checklist can add up when you're hitting 100K+ impressions monthly. Test it small before investing too much time.\n\nThe Facebook invite thing is a black box honestly. I wouldn't count on it happening soon. Focus on what you can control right now.",

Also, you need to find a good tenants to take care of your property. \n\nVending machine, you have to find locations and buying stocks, refilling the machines and maintaining the machines. \n\nDigital Courses, you have create the course and keep it update and most difficult part is to market your self and sell.\n\nOnly true passive income is, if you are wealthy and can take risk. You can be an investor in starts up or go heavy on stock with a good finical advisor. \n\nI might be wrong, but let me know what you think. \n",

You need a way to make sure they don't steal money though, so you might need to invest in a system that keeps track of how much money is in each machine that can be accessed via 5g. And then hire someone who double checks and maybe also does the accounting.\n\nDigital courses can also be outsourced to someone who does like to make them for a monthly wage and isn't interested in freelancing them. A teacher essentially. Marketing can be outsourced to marketing agency. Might as well have your own elearning platform setup by then.\n\n\nSo yes, for the poor its hard.

Cold coffee, messy sheets, and half-finished side stuff I forget even exists.\n\nPinterest was the first surprise. A few years back I threw up some random designs pointing at a tiny site I had. Then I moved on. Months later I peeked just out of boredom and saw those same pins still sending people my way. I hadn’t logged in forever. Felt like finding cash in old jeans, but online.\n\nMedium did the same thing. I tossed a couple posts about what I was messing with on Etsy, nothing polished, didn’t share them anywhere. They somehow kept getting read. Every few weeks I’d get a tiny “you got paid” ping and just laugh.\n\nEtsy kept doing its own thing too. Some listings with reviews kept selling. Even old trend stuff I swore was dead still sold a few here and there. Phone goes cha-ching while I’m half-asleep, still one of my favorite sounds ever.\n\nAnd the nerdy bit: I figured out a way to get my old pages showing up on Google again faster. Nothing fancy, just me tinkering too much. But it worked. That slow drip of visitors never really stopped.\n\nNone of this was planned. I messed around, forgot half of it, and somehow some of it stuck. Tiny, low effort, kinda messy but it keeps paying for caffeine, and that’s good enough for me.",

I studied abroad for 6 long years. The first few years were fine — textbooks, exams, good grades. But everything changed when we started working with real patients.\n\nThe first surgery I witnessed, I fainted. I couldn’t handle the blood, the pain, the reality. In the ER, I saw my first patient die during CPR, and I broke down crying. They thought I was a family member. That’s when I realized — I’m not built for this. But after five years, it felt too late to quit.\n\nNow I’ve graduated, and my parents — who’ve sacrificed everything for me — keep saying how I’ll finally make things better for the family. My dad is even planning to retire once I start residency. But the truth is… I can’t do it. I can’t be a doctor.\n\nWe’re struggling financially, I’m the oldest of many siblings, and the pressure is unbearable. I’ve tried applying for other jobs, but they either aren’t in my major so won’t accept me, or they need experience I don’t have — and the few that do hire pay so little it would barely cover my transportation.\n\nI speak five languages, I’m outgoing, good at sales, social media, and editing — but I feel trapped between guilt and fear. My family’s counting on me, but I don’t even know who I am anymore.\n\nIf anyone knows where or how I could start a new job or find a different path, please… I’d really appreciate any advice or direction. I just want to start somewhere.",

Also, back to the public health, we have another doctor that exclusively works with our EMS department on planning and organizing. Some places in the county just need a doctor on site and they dont have to actually do anything. You also might be able to teach at a JC or one of those schools that do the fast track programs.

He has a good practice going and makes a really good salary equivalent to what he be making in the field he went to school for.\n\nNot having experience yet shouldn’t be a dealbreaker, because you do have experience -it’s just how you frame it as you’re starting off.  At one of my former companies, we hired people less than a year out of medical school for good jobs. Granted they were from the Ivys so that probably made a difference but simply think of ways to convert your résumé that would appeal to whatever job you’re thinking of. \n\nFor example, you could put on there the volume of patients you saw in residency and how many cases you’re responsible for, you can talk about how many reports and administrative items you successfully completed.\n\nJust as an example, you can say something like, “ successfully monitored 30 patients a day in a 2000 bed facility while reviewing 150 medical reports a week”. \n\nGood luck let us know what you decide.",

They sort of see you as an extension of themselves. Nothing wrong with wanting to please your parents. However, you are an individual in your own right.\n\nYou said your dad wants to retire soon but you can’t be a doctor. Is your dad expecting you to help support the family with your doctor degree after he retires? If so, I am not sure that is fair. Yes he did give you everything to get to your doctor degree but he needs to let you build your own life.\n\nMany posted here telling you how you have so many options that you can do with your degree that do not involve seeing patients or blood. I would consider those options.\n\nHowever, I think you need to also consider doing something that YOU choose to do. Even if not as a full time career. Do you have any hobbies? Try to find something YOU are interested and make a goal to create something of it: whether it be developing a hobby to enjoy on the side or even turning it into a part time or full time business. You can start this slowly as a side thing while you are working as a doctor. \n\nBy doing something that YOU decided to do you will start to develop a sense of self that is not an extension of your parents and will gain the confidence you seek in anything you do.\n\nI can relate to your situation because I was in a similar situation as you. \n\nGive yourself time to grow. Life can be hard at times but it will get better. Start putting in some endeavors in to your day that you enjoy doing and that YOU choose to do and then over time you will start to feel like you are living YOUR life and not just your parents’ version of your life, even if you choose to remain in the medical field in some capacity.",

How could you have graduated medical school without encountering blood many times, dead bodies, dying patients, sick to the stomach patients etc. \nSimple logic tells me no medical course or curriculum will not ensure, psychological, mental, emotional etc effects of the every day trauma that a medical doctor will face in the real world?

I feel like the difference is that we can keep composure in the moment and do our jobs. As long as we don’t panic, let our emotions give us tunnel vision so we can’t do our jobs or perform CPR properly, it’s ok to cry at the end of it. I’ll do a 5 hour case, be ok during the case and do my job but at the end when it’s all done and I process things is when the tears come. I see a lot of death and it is hard. But crying, making others around us remember that these are people loved with families is what makes us human and connects us to our patients.\n\nWith that being said, sometimes it’s just not our thing and that’s ok too.

It didn’t happen overnight, but after the setup, the results started compounding quietly in the background.\nIf you’re stretched thin right now, don’t chase income streams build one smart system that can eventually buy your time back. That’s the turning point most people miss when they’re drowning in work",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training glfrom beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free! At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

      "selftext": "Before you downvote, hear me out. I know this sub generally views gambling negatively, but I wanted to share some hard-learned lessons about risk management that actually apply to any form of investing or speculation.\n\nBackground: I'm a software engineer who got into sports betting during COVID. What started as $100 bets quickly escalated, and I ended up wagering about $50k over the course of 2023. I'm up about $3,200 overall, but the real value was learning proper bankroll management principles.\n\nThe Kelly Criterion in Practice: The most important thing I learned was position sizing. In sports betting, there's something called the Kelly Criterion that determines optimal bet size based on your edge and the odds. The formula is:\n\nf = (bp - q) / b\n\nWhere:\n\nf = fraction of bankroll to bet\n\nb = odds received (decimal odds - 1)\n\np = probability of winning\n\nq = probability of losing (1 - p)\n\nReal Example: If I think a team has a 55% chance of winning, but the book is offering +100 odds (50% implied probability), the Kelly formula suggests betting about 10% of my bankroll. Most people would bet way more because \"it's a sure thing.\"\n\nWhat This Taught Me About Regular Investing:\n\n1. Position Sizing Matters More Than Pick Quality Even if you're right 60% of the time, betting too much on any single outcome will eventually ruin you. This applies directly to stock picking or crypto investments.\n\n2. Emotional Control is Everything After a big win, I wanted to bet more. After losses, I wanted to \"chase\" to get even. Sound familiar to anyone who's panic-sold stocks or FOMO'd into crypto?\n\n3. Diversification Isn't Just About Different Assets I learned to spread bets across different sports, bet types, and time periods. The same way you shouldn't put everything in tech stocks, you shouldn't put everything on \"sure thing\" bets.\n\n4. Track Everything I kept detailed records of every bet - amount, reasoning, outcome. This showed me I was actually terrible at NFL betting but good at tennis. Most people don't track their investment performance this granularly.\n\nThe Practical Takeaway: Whether you're buying individual stocks, crypto, or yes, even sports betting, the math of risk management is the same. The Kelly Criterion can help determine position sizes for any investment where you think you have an edge.\n\nTools I Use: For anyone curious, I primarily use bet105 now because their reduced juice (-105 vs standard -110) significantly improves long-term returns. It's like finding an index fund with a 0.1% expense ratio vs 0.5% - small differences compound over time.\n\nThe Bottom Line: I'm not advocating for sports betting as an investment strategy. But the risk management principles I learned apply to everything from stock picking to starting a business. Sometimes the best lessons come from unexpected places. Anyone else learned investing principles from non-traditional sources?",

Here’s what worked (and what didn’t):\n\n1. Start ugly, sell fast.\nMy first site looked like it came from a $20 template. But it solved the client’s problem (they just needed something live for a campaign). Don’t overthink polish in the beginning.\n\n2. Cold outreach &gt; waiting.\nAt first, I kept posting “looking for clients” ads and got nothing. What finally worked was sending personalized DMs/emails. I’d literally pick a small business, redesign a section of their homepage, and send it with a note: “This is how your site could look.”\n\n3. Use the right stack.\nI started with Framer templates, sometimes even Lovable. Later I hacked faster by combining an open-source starter (Frameable) with AI coding (Claude/ChatGPT). That mix let me deliver quickly without getting stuck when clients wanted small custom changes.\n\n4. Raise prices early.\nI was charging $300–500 for weeks of work. Dumb. Once I had a few sites in my portfolio, I started quoting $1,200+. Fewer clients, better margins, less burnout.\n\n\t\n5. Referrals snowball.\nMy first 3 clients all came from outreach. But by the time I had 6–7, new ones started showing up through word of mouth. That’s when things got way easier.\n\nI’m not claiming guru status. I just kept iterating until something clicked.",

      "selftext": "Real talk if you’re not willing to invest *anything* (not money, not time, not effort), then passive income just isn’t for you.\n\nI see so many people saying they want to “make money while they sleep,” but they don’t even want to stay awake long enough to learn a skill, build something, or take a small risk. That’s not how it works.\n\nPassive income isn’t some magic loophole that prints cash. It’s the reward for front-loading the hard work putting in the effort *now* so you don’t have to later. Every person who’s built something that earns passively has paid in *either time, money, or both.*\n\nIf you’re starting from $0, that’s fine but be ready to grind. Learn copywriting, create digital products, start a YouTube channel, build a blog, anything. But if your plan is to do nothing and somehow earn something, you’re better off buying a lottery ticket.\n\nPeople love the idea of “passive income” because it sounds effortless. But in reality, it’s just *delayed effort.*\n\n  \nIs there *any* way to start truly passive income from $0 without investing a single hour or dollar? Or is that just a fantasy that social media keeps selling us?",

Prolific apparently has a waitlist but I will reccomend it to everybody. Its legitimate and will always be helpful if you're looking for some side money with little time. DA, well. Look it up, decide if its for you. There's a lot of time investment upfront taking the tests and getting in. After that, it's longer time commitments, like at least an hour at a time to do things.

Most of them are just selling guides or courses, and *that's* how they make their money not from the methods they’re advertising. They prey on people hoping for easy cash, selling info that should honestly be free.\n\nThe truth is, people who are actually making money don’t usually need to prove it, because they’re not trying to sell you anything. I’ve personally been making money through affiliate marketing for the past 18 years. It *does* work, but it’s not instant, and it definitely takes effort to learn and grow. That’s usually where people give up right at the beginning when it feels hard or slow.\n\nBottom line: **Effort = Results.** If you’re serious about it and want to talk more, feel free to DM me.

But once I understood how to market and started posting consistent faceless content, it clicked.

Moreover, it is becoming an important topic as more marketers are making the transition to affiliate marketing.\n\nHi everyone — short story: I’ve been in e-commerce for 8 years in my own businesses + former agency (video editing, copy, design, built my own sites + custom landing pages, ran Meta, Google &amp; TikTok ads, shots with influencers etc). This year I lost my business after the Meta update (not going into more details here), so I’m pivoting to affiliate full-time — but organically.\n\nGoal: $2–3k / month as my first milestone. No paid ads for now.\nI know that the main job of the affiliate is to drive traffic and that comes thrugh mainly this:\n-&gt; providing value on great content, creating a community and finding good offers (ideally subscription based OR high ticket) , right?\n\nI’m thinking of: mix of faceless + on-camera (reviews, short explainers, case studies), owning landing pages + email funnel. I can code pages, make creatives, and edit like hell — but I need the strategy and the fastest path to those first reliable commissions.\n\nBasically, it would be a great help for me if a PRO affiliate would take a few minutes and briefly lay out his approach.\n\nSo I want to ask you: what strategy would you take if you were me — with these skills but zero ad budget (for now) — to hit 2–3k/month?\n\nTo make replies easier, here are the constraints &amp; \"assets\":\n\n- 8 yrs ecommerce (I know funnels &amp; analytics)\n- I can make video + long reviews + edit fast - I have some doubts about putting my face on it, but ok, if I find an offer I can really believe in, let's do it\n- I can build landing pages\n- email is not my thing - but I'll learn that fast and build magnets to increase my DB\n- I have experience 8yrs of running ads (so I can scale later) but no ad budget now — must be organic, partnerships, barter, SEO, email, Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, etc.\n- I have no channels / communities of my own, I ONLY have a 200k email list (ecommerce products, maybe I can use them for something, but most of them are age 50+)\n- Based in Romania , Europe (that's important too I guess) I can create also for local people OR for international market - another BIG questions of mine\n\nWhat I’d love from the community:\n\n* Growth paths / approaches\n* Language approaches? (local / international market?) \n* Best offer types to chase first (recurring vs one-time? high AOV vs high conversion?)\n* Any quick templates? :D (DM script, hook examples, landing layout) you’d recommend\n* If you’re offering collab/mentorship/have a product that fits ... drop a reply or DM me.\n\nIf you can share your tactic, I think there are a lot of people in my position, and i think that this sub will become one of my new best buddies haha.. Let’s build something useful for everyone :D \n\n(Yes I used chatGPT to polish my post because english is not my first language and it helped me to structure the ideas for a better understanding)",

      "selftext": "Another month, another update for my tool site [terrific.tools](http://terrific.tools/) \\- here's the [previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1n9vg6d/im_building_a_tool_site_month_9_update/) one.\n\nThings are starting to get a bit more exciting now. First the numbers, though. \n\nThe site is now at 31k session for the last 30 days and has thereby grown by 5k monthly sessions since the last update. \n\nI won't reach my goal of 50k monthly sessions by the end of the year but at least it continues to grow.\n\nBut now on the exciting bit: I was accepted into Mediavine (kind of!). I made a few posts on Reddit, asking about ad networks tailored for tool sites.\n\nThe CEO of Mediavine eventually reached out and put me in touch with his team. \n\nThat said, I won't be onboarded onto Mediavine for now but one of their other ad networks, which is called PubNation (any experience with PubNation is greatly appreciated). \n\nAs the tool site continues to grow, so will hopefully my access to better ad products. \n\nI also hope that enabling ads will allow me to make more money on the [desktop app](https://www.terrific.tools/terrific-tools-desktop) since purchasing the license will also grant users an ad-free experience on the main website. \n\nMoreover, I also started releasing some improvements to the desktop app. I will go full-time on our other SaaS and the tool site by the end of the year, so hopefully can get those out more frequently. \n\nLastly, I [finally added Google authentication](https://x.com/onlinedopamine/status/1966209490727932397) to the tool site, which allowed me to double my signups in a month. Not sure if all of those are legit but at least I now have a growing email list I can tap into eventually. ",

      "selftext": "I've been searching on the web for a while, trying to find something I can do to gain financial stability to get to my dream goal of building a dog training facility.  I am 28f, with a few medical issues that I want to overcome.  I am passionate in training dogs, birds, cats, and overall love listening to others.  I truly love to people part of dog training.  I have 14 years of education in dog training, learning under multiple mentors. Many people have told me I need to write a book about my life and that I give great life advice because of what my medical conditions have put me through.  I feel a lot of people look up to me, though I strongly feel inadequate in that realm.  I want to blog about my journey to success.\n\nThe best thing is I have massive support to get through this, in the sense of, stable housing without needing to work, disability income (that I wish to work towards going off), and overall emotional support of my friends.  With that said, my goals are:\n\n* To build inspiration in others who are in my shoes or in similar situations.  Create guides on how to grow a business that works around their chronic illness(es).\n* Share my story in a book that encompasses life lessons I have learned along the way.\n* Eventually sell products (like t-shirts, buttons, patches) that bring awareness and possibly create a non-profit to help people in my shoes.\n* Start public speaking about my journey and how I conquered my medical conditions.\n* Eventually, **create my own dog training and boarding business** as that's my biggest passion (this has a huge startup cost, so I need a way to make the money)\n\nWith that said, my biggest setback is really just my medical conditions.  They are neurological, and after an injury, my brain struggles to learn information, but that's getting better.  I have struggled with the next steps after figuring out my goals, such as, what I need to learn to accomplish this and the basic steps to get started.  It all seems overwhelming, but I know once the ball gets rolling I will figure it all out.  My biggest inspiration is Temple Grandin. I am autistic and an extremely visual and hands on learner.\n\nAny advice, words of wisdom, or guidance would be much appreciated.",

Everything hovered around page 7–10 for weeks.\n\nAt first, I did what everyone says: write good metadata, place keyword more in the content, get a few backlinks. But still Nothing changed.\nThat’s when I realized that my content wasn’t bad, it just didn’t match what Google thought was useful.\n\nSo I started analyzing it properly.\nI used a tool I’ve been building called Pikera SEO (https://pikeraai.com/) which basically lets me see why competitors outrank me — not just “they have more links”, but what’s different in their structure, topics, or page intent.\n\nWhat I found blew my mind:\n\nMy “Keyword Research Checklist for Startups” post was targeting a transactional-intent keyword with an informational article.\n\nCompetitors weren’t just writing checklists; they were mapping each checklist item to startup-specific use cases, like “finding first 10 customers” or “launching on Product Hunt.”\n\nMy outline missed 4–5 key semantic areas Google expected for that topic.\n\nI rebuilt the article with those missing sections, improved the examples, and updated my internal links to match that intent.\n\nWithin 3 weeks, it went from page 9 → page 2, (the growthfolks website post is mine) and impressions are still increasing.\nI still don't have massive traffic yet, but at least it’s moving upwards.\n\nNow I’m genuinely curious —\nFor those of you who run content sites or SaaS blogs, how do you figure out what’s missing when your content just doesn’t move up?\nDo you rely on gut, tools, or something else entirely?\n\nWould love to hear how others diagnose “stuck content”.\n\n(Ps: I'm work on Pikera SEO, so I’ve been using it to experiment on my own projects — not trying to pitch, just curious what methods others here use.)\n\nYou can also use Pikera SEO (https://pikeraai.com/) to understand how to align your content in such a way that google protiosize in ranking.\n\nInfact I used Pikera SEO to rank for the keyword \"AI Powered SEO Assistant\" by copy-pasting the content it gave within just 3-4 days with just DA 2.  \n\nHERE's a sample report: https://pikeraai.com/demo-report\n",

      "selftext": "ok so for context ive been doing this for about 3 years now. startups bring me in when shit hits the fan - not the \"we ran out of money\" fan, the \"our product literally cannot scale and we have no idea why\" fan\n\nand theres this pattern that shows up EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.\n\nmonth 1-6: everything is great. moving fast, shipping features, customers are happy, lifes good\n\nmonth 7-12: things start slowing down. weird bugs popping up. \"we'll fix it later\" becomes the team motto\n\nmonth 13-18: you literally cannot add a new feature without breaking 3 old ones. every deploy is stressful\n\nmonth 19-24: youve now hired 3 more engineers and theyre just maintaining the existing mess. not building anything new\n\nmonth 25+: rebuild from scratch or watch your startup die in slow motion\n\n**what i found in those 47 codebases:**\n\nlike 89% had zero database indexing. ZERO. your app is slow because youre searching through 100,000 records on every single request. thats not a bug thats just... why\n\n76% were paying for like 8x more servers than they needed. the average is 13% utilization - youre paying for 100 servers and using 13 of them. burning $3k-15k a month for nothing\n\n68% had auth vulnerabilities that would make any security person have a panic attack\n\n91% had no automated tests at all. so every new feature is literally russian roulette\n\n**the math on this is depressing:**\n\navg engineer salary is like $120k right stripe did research showing devs spend 42% of time dealing with bad code so for a team of 4 over 3 years thats $600k+ just... wasted. on maintaining garbage then add $200-400k to rebuild plus 6-12 months of lost revenue during the rebuild total damage per company: $2-3M\n\nand founders dont realize until month 18-24. by then youve raised series A based on growth that is about to completely fall apart\n\n**what actually prevents this:**\n\nhonestly just spend 2 weeks on architecture before writing code. i know its boring and you wanna ship fast but those 2 weeks save you 18 months of hell\n\nthink \"what breaks at 10,000 users\" not \"what works for 100 users\" - your db queries, file uploads, background jobs, everything needs to handle 100x day one\n\nautomate tests from the start. if you cant click one button and know nothing broke youre just gambling\n\npick boring tech. react/node/postgres is boring and thats GOOD. you can hire for it, theres stackoverflow answers, it doesnt randomly die at 2am\n\nget someone whos done this to review your architecture in WEEK ONE. not month 12 when its too late\n\n**the part nobody wants to hear:**\n\nmost technical cofounders and first eng hires are really good at coding but have never architected something that scales. its like being a great cook but never running a restaurant kitchen during dinner rush\n\nreal example from last month - saas company spending $47k/month on aws\n\ni did a 3 day review and found:\n\n* running 40 servers when they needed 6\n* storing files in literally the most expensive way possible\n* db queries taking 4 seconds that should take 40 milliseconds\n\nnew bill: $8,200/month\n\nthey saved $38,800 PER MONTH. thats $465k a year. for 3 days of work.\n\n**why im posting this**\n\nbecause im tired of watching founders burn 18 months and $500k-2M learning lessons that are completely avoidable\n\n\"move fast break things\" works when youre facebook with unlimited money. for your startup its just suicide\n\n**if youre building something right now ask yourself:**\n\n* what breaks at 10x current users?\n* do you have automated tests?\n* can your db handle 100x the queries?\n* would your infrastructure cost $50k/month at 10k users?\n\nif you said \"i dont know\" to any of these youre building on quicksand\n\nhappy to answer questions about tech stack or architecture stuff in comments. ive seen this movie too many times. \n\nMeir Avimelec Davidov (You can search me over linkedin)  \nFounder &amp; CEO of gliltech software",

Feature speed ground to a halt and we ended up with barely used features with crazy complex architectures that imagined that this feature was going to be centre of the future of the platform and was hideously over engineered, where the reality was most features missed the mark and were sidelined as we learnt what users wanted.\n\nAfter all that bullshit, we still needed to rewrite the whole thing about 24 months in as it was too bloated and complex to build on.\n\nI've come to realise that can't it's like the most immutable developer trait. Someone who likes building fast, hates slowing down and doing all the design stuff as they see it as time wasting, when they could be shipping features and someone who loves scalable coding usually thinks the other guys are idiots and they are far superior. You try to get one to do the other and they usually quit rather than do it.\n\nHaving built multiple products from scratch, I'd rather the quick scrappy guys to get started and then layer in some of the other guys as you need to scale. I just try to steer things a little, so scaling isn't too bad but get those guys in too early and your company will die before you get any customers.",

Although its starting point may seem easy and humorous, it demonstrates how to find potential user groups on very specific needs through data-driven business models and successfully convert them into profits. Firstly, the power of segmented markets: just like trust funds searching for investment opportunities with long-term stable returns, this website targets an extremely specific and off mainstream demand - to record and compare \"fart\" data. By creating a sufficiently refined product that can attract highly focused user groups (such as those interested in gut health) and increase user stickiness through additional features such as user generated content and food tracking, this is a market strategy with the potential for long-term stable growth.",

It appears the entire middle market got destroyed by AI slop and low efort podcasts and generally there is a fear of income loss for any production.\n\nCreators spend a ton on production and editing etc and they are losing views and engagement to AI shorts about women washing dishes in the olympics. 4 millions likes that short got. There are clients with 10m+ subs getting less than 100k views now. So, its clear, AI will kill jobs in code generation and content creation.\n\nWhat exactly is going to pay everyone's bills??? Id love to know how everyone else is handling this.\n\nedit: a lot of comments are underestimating the magnitude of this. These are not just random people that will be directly or indirectly affected. It will be fathers and mothers. Brothers and sisters. Sons and daughters. And to those that think they are immune to AI, like mechanics, when people lose their jobs/incomes, they typically dont keep 2-3 cars.\n\nedit: apparently China waited for the markets to close before telling DJT we aren't getting those gpus. In this game of high-stakes poker, DJT like to play his cards face-up.",

From Hollywood to YouTube to agencies, the creative industry is currently in transition and anyone claiming to have the answers as to where it ends up is completely full of shit. The biggest studios and brands in the world are all experiencing this reality while still investing millions into top talent to crack the code yet few are succeeding. With the rate of change, what works this week may not be relevant next week. Content creation is caught in one of the first waves of AI disruption. \n\nThis really isn’t OP’s fault, show some empathy. Many of you will have similar experiences in the near future as the AI wave disrupts more industries.\n\nOP, as someone who works in this industry providing b2b video services and owns a growing YouTube channel, a suggestion would be to target companies/creators with offline audiences. For example, I’m experiencing a similar situation but I’ve found some success partnering with organizations that host large in person events at convention centers. These days many events feature a video and in my experience, not many agencies or production companies are pursuing these projects. They don’t pay as well as commercials but they can help keep the lights on while we seek clarity for the future. \n\nBest of luck!",

The ones that focused on talent and high end were successful and the scraps were left to small businesses to fight over.\n\nThe businesses that will be hurt the most are the average ones.

People do still like human made content, AI can do a lot but it isn't perfect, and it will never quite have the same touch. All that can be done is competition with higher quality, good content that connects with the user base, creating more meaningful connection between the viewers and the creators. That's the only way I can see it is through connecting and raising the bar",

Did (roughly) $600k in 2022, maybe a few dollars over $1M in 2023, slump in 2024 had us around $999k, then $1.5M pushing toward $1.8M for this year.",

You have to decide you’ll make it happen no matter what, that you’d rather go broke chasing it than live comfortably working for someone else.\n\nIt takes 13 hour days, relentless hustle, and a mindset that borders on delusion while people smile and nod with half hearted support.

I made each person feel special, heard, and tried to really listen to their stories. I wrote down their name, number, and notes about them. Before they came in to their next appt, I reviewed my notes. Little by little I grew my clientele. Eventually I was able to rent a chair. Eventually I moved salons to a busier location. After a three years, in 1994, I opened a shop that was less than 500 sq ft. Had a business partner, my boyfriend and later got married. 1.5 years later expanded to 1100sq ft. 14 years later, 2006 we sold the shop and moved out of the country. 2000 we broke ground and build a resort in Greece. In 2007 moved back and rebuilt in a nearby neighborhood of our original location where clients can find us again. We continued to build the resort abroad. 2008 the housing crisis hurt the business. We shifted from having employees to transitioning them to rental stylists. 2016 our marriage suffered. 2018 we closed the shop, divorced and I went on my own to continue to grow and shift the business model.

      "selftext": "I met an aspiring entrepreneur from my community who is currently working in a 9-5 job and he wants to quit and go all in. He wanted to listen to my experience and my take on starting a business. The first thing I told him is that it is so difficult. His face changed immediately May be he was expecting some delightful words. He might have had a rosy picture that running a business is all jolly good. \n\nHe said I can find investors, there is a 3 PhD holders team, R&amp;D IP and what not. There is this one client who may pay for the product if they can build it spending 800k$. So on paper it’s just words and promises. I told him that a business should run not because there is funding, or employees are working hard, or there is a trend you can surf on. A business runs when there are customers who are willing to pay for what you sell. Simple. And that part is the hardest in an economically turbulent world. And when revenue doesn’t flow in, everything else becomes tough. I await invoices as small as 2000$ which were not paid by clients for months. I told him that you will be choked every month with no light at the end of the tunnel. May be I should have just lied to him it’s going to be awesome. May be I should have said more nice things but I had very few nice things to say. How would you describe your journey to an aspiring entrepreneur? Roses or thorns? Or a mix of both?",

And, there are other things you can do to validate on the way like interviews, creating a prototype, audience testing, etc. I think I probably would have told him that he has a lot of promising things in alignment and it will become real when pen goes to paper and that first check is in the door.\n\nI have gone broke multiple times paying payroll, screwed up my personal finances trying to stay afloat, stressed myself to the point of illness, and also had some of the very best times of my life as an entrepreneur.

I spent years trying to build \"revolutionary\" products from scratch, including this esports betting platform where we were basically inventing everything as we went. Massive headaches, tons of wasted time figuring out if anyone even wanted what we were building. Now when I look at markets, I do exactly what you did - find something that's already working but has obvious pain points. The AI model switching thing is such a perfect example because anyone who uses multiple models feels that frustration daily. What's brilliant about your execution is you didn't try to out-feature the big player, you went the opposite direction and made it cleaner. I see this all the time in mobile development where apps get bloated trying to serve everyone, then someone comes in with a focused version and steals a chunk of users who just wanted something simple. The AppSumo deal sounds promising too - those lifetime deals can be tricky for recurring revenue but they're great for getting that initial user base and feedback. The validation aspect you mentioned is huge, most entrepreneurs waste months building in a vacuum when they could be looking at existing solutions and thinking \"how can I make this better for a specific group of people\" instead of trying to reinvent everything.",

I'm not asking from a legal standpoint but I've always found that the people I hire that are most dedicated are also usually the worst at their actual job but also they are the ones most willing to follow a plan laid out for them to fix it. \n\nI've hired plenty of people who were really good at sales as an example (and I know that's a personality itself) and I could get them to sell anything and it was great. However, when something wasn't going right they were the biggest pain in the ass. One time, we didn't have the right business license in this state we were about to do a show in and it was 4:30PM on a Friday, one of my dedicated people (but not good at sales) called up the local license place and they said they had already closed for the day and she went and found a neighbouring town, called them up and begged them to stay open for a few extra minutes took a cab and drove out there and got the license. All without needing me to handhold her and she knew she didn't have time to wait for my permission but she also knew the show wouldn't happen without it. \n\nSo we worked on her weaknesses and I spent extra time training her and eventually just started hiring sales people to work under her because the amount of peace of mind I had with her was still worth it.",

I listed their skills and interests and connected them to careers they would find more satisfying. Each one took my advice and moved on in the direction I suggested.

Companies are looking for a stable firm that they know they can trust many years into the future.   \n2. Sounds like you are struggling to articulate value for the prospects and that takes time to develop. But start with what you have delivered in the past and spin it into what you can deliver in the future.   \n3. First step is to find the first client and often that will happen from a referral from a friend. Reach out to your friends in the industry asking them to help you get introduced. Often the personal referral from a trusted source is enough to get you started.   \nBest wishes",

In person networking - most b2b sales will come because of a referral, and doing in person networking.  Our first client actually came from a referral for a man I had helped 2 years earlier.  He had me on his email list so I decided to reach back out to him and share with him what we were offering, quickly saw the value and connected me with several of his clients which all signed on to our services.  We then started attending different networking groups.  The key here is that not a ton of direct sales happen from in person networking.  What happens is you build your referral base from networking and then they refer clients to you.  \n\n2. We read some books that showed us our marketing message was so good. Specifically Story Branding and Star with Why.  They helped so much.  Once we realized our messaging was wrong and updated it we started getting more and more traction from our networking.  \n\nI think most ppl ignore in person networking bc they are building an “online business” but if you are doing 2b2 it’s so key!",

You are selling solutions to their problems, and outcomes, not services and just skills. Ideally, this varies per industry target, per lead source, per partnership type. For example: AI, data management, and security are massive points of interest to most companies- think about how and who you help most to enable those related challenges, costs, or risks.\n\nOther leads and sources would be IT conferences, or any networking events that your buyers and stakeholders would attend.

          "body": "You’re not alone here, but the real issue isn’t your technical ability. It’s how you’re communicating your value. Most engineers try to sell what they do instead of what it means for the client’s business. Small clinics don’t care about data centers or infrastructure. They care about uptime, compliance, and how much productivity they lose when things break.\n\nIf you lead with “I design enterprise-grade infrastructure,” you’ll lose them immediately. But if you say, “I help healthcare practices eliminate downtime and avoid compliance risks through secure, high-availability networks,” now you’re speaking their language. You’re connecting your service to a tangible pain point instead of a technical feature.\n\nI’d also rethink your outreach approach. Cold calling small businesses usually fails because they don’t understand the value yet. Try partnering with MSPs, compliance consultants, or IT service providers who already have relationships with your ideal clients. Offer to take on the complex networking or cloud projects they prefer to refer out. One good partnership can do more than months of random outreach.\n\nFinally, start showing proof of expertise. Write short case studies or even quick LinkedIn posts about common mistakes you fix. Something like “how one clinic lost a day of patient data because of a bad firewall setup” or “how we reduced downtime by 80% with a small infrastructure tweak.” That type of content builds quiet authority and creates inbound interest over time.\n\nThe technical part isn’t what holds most consultants back. It’s learning how to translate that skill into business outcomes that decision makers actually care about. Once you do that, traction starts to come naturally.",

It's difficult to do on your own, I had the support of organisation and other staff, management etc.  This is because you have an idea that it is the sales side but still not sure because of lack of experience.  Thus the learning curve that takes at least 3 months speaking to 20 people a day to even get one sale can be especially daunting. \n\nfind other ways to get leads, marketing and advertising.  But when the leads come in, you still have to sell.  And if you haven't got the skill you might waste quite a few marketing dollars. It most likely will take 3 months to get your first sale.  Not counting the sale from beginners luck.  This is generally from a warm lead.\n\nFrom what I heard more and more b2b companies are using less and less cold calling.",

You must have a clear ICP defined (Ideal Customer Profile). After that, think about **what value you are giving to them**, what is your offer that must be a no-brainer in terms of decision-making.

It's frustrating when you know you can deliver but can't get the first conversation. Your expertise isn't the issue, it's how you position it to your clients.\n\nHere's my take:\n\n1. Reframe from IT consultant to Problem Solver. Talking about data center and enterprise networking to small business owners sounds expensive and complex. They just want to know if your solutions can make their internet faster, stop their system from crashing etc. Repackage your offer around their core anxieties like reliability, security and simplicity.\n2. Stop Cold Calling and Start Building Trust. Cold calling is like charging a fortified wall without intelligence, it rarely works unless you are a sales prodigy. Instead, provide value first. Offer a free, simple network check-up or be the helpful person in the online forums and local business groups who answers IT questions. Don't sell, just help. Let them see you as an Ally.\n3. Find Partners, not just Clients. Your fastest path to clients is through partnerships. Reach out to Managed Service Providers, web developers or cybersecurity firms. They already have the trust of your target clients and often run into projects that are too complex for them, which is what you solve. propose a referral partnership.\n\nYou have the expertise. Now it's about layering on the trust and positioning. Once you are a trusted voice, your clients will come.\n\n(Source: I guide leaders on market engagement and write about these principles in \"The Strategic Treatise\", I will be starting a weekly \"Insight First Clinic\" on Reddit to break down problems like this.)",

I explained inherent limitation of our position: \n- wrong role divisions - backend architect having been given also partial frontend architect duty, frontend architect doing cloud design, different frontend team being at odds with backend architecf etc. Showed on cases where frontend solution is another API, different frontend end builds features and then await and modifying waiting for backend APIs to work. Shown on few stories.\n- obsolete codebase: core parts of code were not touched for way too long, causing atrophy and causing fear of change (I do not know what else will break), my proposal would be to invest in scheduled, phased rewrite into different language to boost our understanding and optimize interfaces. Shown on what was moved to backlog in previous PP.\n- changing market - customers are looking for more integrated solution than piece meal engine, shown on crying emails from field staff.\n\n\nAll of this could have been addressed via single program as it all comes down to knowledge and understanding. It is like at farm, sometimes you need to grow unpopular plant for your field to yield again.\n\n\nAnyway, none of this was sexy enough in Agile business owner scoring, everybody was voting based on who they knew, who lobbied the best. And they also complained about me trying to spoil the vibe. \n\n\nNow, all of above reduced market potential of that product line to close to zero.\n\n\nLook, emotionally, most people do not grow past middle school.",

I have been an entrepreneur for a significant part of my life, and I grew tired of working for myself, so I decided to go corporate. There was a reason for that.\n\nI ran my own very successful business, making a lot of money, but I had one problem: I realized that I didn't have the knowledge and training to take it to the next level, as I never attended school. \n\nI felt like I had become stagnant, as the competition was growing, and I was dealing with staff. It had become a large operation, where I now had to hire the right people, but I wasn't as knowledgeable in various areas, such as bookkeeping, management, inventory, and logistics. I started to struggle because I only knew what I knew. I didn't have to right people in my environment that could help me and only gave bad advice.\n\nI decided that I needed to learn but going to school wasn't an option since I needed to make money. So I came up with the bright idea to take a job that was in the line of what I was doing and my goal was to learn how the big boy did it. My goal was to do it for a year and go back on my own. Now I have been fulltime for over 10 years and started my own business on the side, which is still in the start up phase however, it was the best decision I ever made.\n\nMy entrepreneurial experience has taught me to be very successful and rise to the top in the business world because I was thinking as a business owner and not like an employee. I learned everything from product management, project management, engineering, marketing, finance, all the missing pieces in real life\n\nI enjoyed that my money was in my account every 2 weeks, regardless if I took a vacation, was sick or even if I didn't feel like working for a few days. My money was coming.\n\nWhere it changed is that my entrepreneurial spirit knew when it was time to get back out on my own and build something, but this time I totally understood everything that I didn't before, and my new business is becoming much more of what I always wanted it to be because now I have a real foundation.\n\nSo I always knew I never meant to work for someone, but I also realized that just because that's what I wanted I wasn't close to ready and figure out how to make it work so I could be successful and that meant becoming a \"slave\" to better understand it.",

Writing a business plan *feels* productive. It's concrete. You can show your parents and they'll nod approvingly.

Because you're essentially writing fiction about a market you haven't actually entered yet.\n\nWant to know if your idea works? Find three people who will pay you money for it. Not \"yeah that sounds cool\" people. Not your cousin who promises to buy it when you launch. Actual humans who open their wallets.\n\nThose three customers will teach you more in a week than six months of planning ever could. They'll tell you what features actually matter, what price point works, and which of your assumptions were completely backwards.\n\nThe business plan can come later, after you've proven someone actually wants what you're selling. Until then, you're just writing expensive fan fiction about your own startup.\n\nAm I wrong, or are we all just allergic to actual validation?",

      "selftext": "I have a confession..\n\nFor years, I thought my problem was imposter syndrome. That voice saying \"you're a fraud, they're going to find you out.\" So I did what you're supposed to do: I worked harder. I over-delivered. I said yes to every client. I hired people to fill the gaps I was scared to admit I had. I chased the next win, thinking it would finally make me feel legitimate.\n\nAnd you know what happened? I became the \"successful\" CEO of a company I absolutely hated. I finally understood the real cost of imposter syndrome. It's not the anxiety. It's the life you build to try and quiet the anxiety. I was so busy trying to prove I was good enough that I built a business that had nothing to do with who I actually am.\n\nThe fix was realizing I had tied my worth to external outcomes (stuff I can't fully control) instead of my personal qualities, which I always can.\n\nOutcomes might get people in the door, but they rarely make people stay. What makes them stay is the real stuff: your integrity, your insight, how you handle a crisis.\n\nFor me, when I made that shift, sales calls stopped being high-stakes performances. They became simple alignment checks: \"Are we a true fit for each other?\" The pressure to \"beat\" competitors vanished. No one can compete with who you *are* at your core. They can only compete on the commoditized outcomes.\n\nJust wanted to put this out there in case anyone else is building a prison and mistaking it for a legacy.\n\n  \n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*: Let me clarify the one thing I didn't make clear.\n\nThat \"prison\" business? I left it behind. I didn't fix it. I walked the fuck away and built something new from scratch (after a break). The new thing is the exact opposite: it runs on a different scale I mentioned above. I only do work that aligns with who I am. And the interesting part is that it's more profitable. \n\nI guess my original point got missed: this wasn't so much about work-life balance.. more about building a business that was literally designed by my insecurities. The workaholism was a symptom of building an entire life around proving I wasn't a fraud.\n\nHope that clears things up a bit. ",

The people who fail, the people who hate the experience, the people who wish they would've just taken that job... don't write books. You don't hear their stories often enough, if at all.\n\nHere I am, 9 years into my company, literally courting serious offers from buyers, eying an exit just around the corner, realizing it won't be big enough to retire on and I will have still have years to work afterwards... and now what? IDK!\n\nThat said, I'm happy. I learned to make time for myself along the way, for time with those I love, to volunteer, to be social. To buy season tickets to the local touring Broadway series and take my mom and other loved ones to shows with me. I worked hard these last years, but I don't hate my life or my business. I just am bummed that I wasn't successful on the level of \"retire rich and early\" or being bought out for a billion dollars, or having needed a B-round and C-round and an IPO.\n\n*On the other hand, you are misattributing your experience to imposter syndrome, when you were a workaholic and failed to focus on happiness.*\n\nHere is the thing, you make this giant statement that your unhappiness is the consequence of imposter syndrome. Lol. That isn't what imposter syndrome is. Look it up. It is failing to believe you're skilled or knowledgeable enough at a professional level.\n\nYou go on to explain your real problem was yourself. You were focused on things that weren't imposter syndrome but the fantasy of landing the biggest deals and making the most possible money. This wasn't imposter syndrome, it was chasing a dream that wasn't realistic.\n\nYour post comes back around: know your worth. Know what makes you happy. Ensure those are in balance.\n\nBut own what caused the problem: your daydreams and workaholicism, not imposter syndrome.",

When I finally had a courage to start my own business, I thought I freed myself from a prison. Soon I realised that I put myself in my own prison I had created. Took me a few years to get out of it. \n\nI realised that the root cause of the anxiety and the imposter syndrome was a programming, a conditioning/brainwashing, I grew up with and lived by that defined who I was and how I should be. No matter what I did, I was trying to be who I was not. I was trying to be who I was supposed to be. So I was “trying” hard to be a great imposter without realising. And the programming is deep and the conditioning very strong with all the incentives built into them to keep me in the prison. The biggest incentive, a carrot, was an illusive success I was chasing that I could never attain. Or rather, chasing a success that led me to a path of never being happy while trying to be happy by becoming successful. \n\nOP, I am almost ready to be at the starting point of the journey that you took on.

          "body": "I had a similar experience working as an employee.  I have a degree in photography and 20 years experience in audio / video work.  I signed up to be the \"Creative Director\" for a medium size reseller (privately owned).  The owner / boss had hired consultants.  Consultants told him he needed \"social media presence.\"  \n\nEssentially, my job as creative director was 3 fold.  He wanted someone to run his social media channels, create commercial video content, and design and manage a multi-camera live-streaming classroom (that would produce social media content).  \n\nI was new to social media and live-streaming so I offered to train for the position at $25 / hr with the understanding that once I was \"up to speed\" I wanted to negotiate my actual starting salary.  We discussed this as a \"test drive\" to see if I fit in the position.  \n\n6 months in I had designed a single operator 4 camera live-streaming classroom studio, and also created the first examples and pipeline to make commercial videos for his 150+ products at the speed of 1-2 videos / wk.  Social media posting and managing was just around the corner.  I have tons of customer service experience so I was confident about managing social media.  I had excelled in this position as creative director.  \n\nWe had a sit down and I presented my salary proposal asking for just above the zip recruiter average for my area (Creative Director - title on my contract).  $125,000 / yr.  \n\nHe simply replied with \"my answer to your request is no.\"   Building the live-streaming classroom studio has been delayed to \"maybe\" sometime in 2026 and the social media push is \"on hold.\"  \n\nHe offered for me to continue working creating commercial videos at the rate of $25 / hr with a small wage increase \"likely upon review\" at the 1 year mark.  \n\nI provide physical studio real estate, having to shoot video of his machines in the largest room of my house.  These often can't be moved or pushed to the side - ever.  It's a dedicated 12' x 25' space.  Plus, I provide for use to the company $20,000 + in video studio equipment, that often requires updating or replacing.  \n\nAfter tax take home was $36k / yr.  Deducting $6k / yr for real estate space and $6k / yr for studio equipment upkeep.  Actual take home pay after considering resources I was required to provide to retain employment was $24,000 / yr.  \n\nBoss, say well I didn't sign up to buy or pay for \"your\" studio.  Adding that $50k / yr was more than fair for someone starting out making videos.\n\nI gave him back the same \"no\" that he gave me and carefully dropped off all of his machines and property the next day.  \n\nI hadn't felt that good in years.   Maybe you could call it a shifting landscape or a change in business plans, but to me it felt like a massive bait and switch.  Boss had shown his hand.  It was a 10 year ladder to an average salary.  I had walked right into his prison.\n\n  \nI wrote this as the OP's story resonated with me.   I was working full-time, stressing myself out, going above and beyond to prove that I could do 3-4 people's positions maybe to try to silence my own imposter syndrome as there were new elements to this position.  I've never worked so hard and had the \"reward\" swept out from under me at the last minute.   \n\n$25 / hr and having to sacrifice my peace at home + expensive equipment upkeep would had been a prison the entire time.  I spent most of my salary upgrading equipment for his purposes and then I was working for what?  New equipment that \"I\" didn't actually need.   \n\nI'm back to working on my own projects and forming my own companies.  The paychecks are not always steady, but somehow working on my own time for my own goals feels more like breathing air than having to clock into prison.",

I do not know if there a bubble or not- but I can definitely say AI is real cause me and my team cannot imaging a world without AI anymore- because it has helped our team move atleast 2x faster while staying lean. Here are mostly all the ones we pay for\n\n1. ChatGPT: Everyone in the team gets ChatGPT paid version, which helps us summarize, generate reports, and what not\n2. Windsurf/Cursor: Everyone in our team gets either Windsurf or Cursor, which has literally tripled our developer output. We ship products much faster now. Personally I am huge fan of Windsurf Cascade agent that as been able to pull off large changes to our production app from a single prompt! But some prefer Cursor!\n3. Google Nano Banana: This is a new addition but it is crazy how it can make edits to images by keeping certain things same accurate. For example, it can turn a simple product image into full blown professional photoshoot with models etc. It can change color of your products etc. Must have for marketing imo!\n4. Frizerly: Their AI agent can learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website helping us improve our Google ranking. Saves me and my team 10+ hours every week! \n5. Bolt: Our marketing team now quickly spins up landing pages, lead gens using Bolt instead of having to wait for engineering or external contractors. It's not great complex apps for SAAS etc but it's great for marketing landing pages, and simple stuff!\n6. Intercom Fin: We had an issue where whatever we do and document on our website, people kept asking some obvious questions on chat taking up valuable support bandwidth. Now Fin can auto resolve these questions instantly. Other questions get auto routed to real people so that people are not mad as well!\n\nAnd that's about it I guess!",

ChatGPT: I mean come on, you can't go wrong. Best value in terms of capabilities. \n3. Perplexity: they do search better (citations, speed, less hallucinations). Beyond the more than apparent hallucinations that GPT-5 web searches tends to have, I prefer to separate my scattered searches from ChatGPT's memory context. Doing so leads to more coherent responses and better memory recall on ChatGPT's part.\n4. Claude: One word. Projects. You can attach folders from your Google Drive, and Pro Tip: files added to Claude Projects update in real time. ChatGPT's projects only download the state of a file at the time its uploaded. I'll regularly tweak my drafts in Google Docs and come back to my main Project and instantly ask Claude for new feedback. It's amazing. \n5. Notebook LM: not used as much as the others, but is essential when I want to comb through my note archives or want to extract information from a set of sources without data contamination.\n6. n8n\\*: building custom AI agents to perform API actions and other automations that can't be fulfilled by the services above. An asterisk here technically because there's a lot of AI API services integrated through n8n that I use to build my automations.\n7. Comet (Perplexity Browser): more of an active experiment for me, but the agent capabilities do work sometimes. The context of being able to read every tab opened in the browser at once is very helpful when performing a range of miscellaneous tasks.",

      "selftext": "I spent 30 years building my healthcare media business before selling it to private equity in 2021. But before my successful exit, I failed to sell it four times.\n\n**The two biggest mistakes I made:**\n\n1. **Believing you need $10M+ in topline revenue before anyone will take you seriously** \\- This bad advice kept me from getting professional help early on in my selling journey. It also delayed my timing and kept me pointed at a north star that wasn't even true. There are hundreds of quality lower and middle-market M&amp;A firms and brokers who work with businesses well below $10M but with strong EBITDA.\n2. **Trying to manage the sale process myself** \\- I thought I could handle it since I'd built the business and we were small enough. Huge mistake. It's a massive time suck trying to sell, and managing that while growing or maintaining the business is virtually impossible.\n\n**What I found success in:**\n\nHaving someone in my corner who is an expert in the field, has past M&amp;A experience, and follows a proven process makes all the difference. Whether that's an investment bank, M&amp;A advisor, or quality broker depends on your size and situation, but trying to DIY your exit is a recipe for disaster in my opinion.\n\nAfter my deal closed, I stayed on as CEO, growing the business further, and then have spent my last three years sharing my exit journey with other owners who are trying or thinking about selling. I kept seeing many of the same patterns, all are strong business operators, but many are underprepared for selling, getting bad advice, or lacking clarity on what actually drives a successful sale.\n\n**Questions for other business owners:**\n\n* Do you subscribe to the age-old motto that all businesses are built to be sold? Is your dream to successfully exit your business or do you have other plans?\n* If you want to sell, what are the biggest factors standing in your way?\n* If you've sold a business before, what surprised you most about the process?\n* What's the worst advice you've heard about selling a business?\n\nHappy to share more about what worked (and what didn't) in my experience, but for now curious on all your thoughts. Thanks in advance!",

We were still doing our finances ourselves, as opposed to having a CFO or a proper finance person do them in-house, which as you suspect is immediately what I hired after going through the initial process.\n\nOn the second failed attempt, I got to the altar, literally the day of closing, and the buyer came back and said that their investment committee had changed their minds. This was after five months of due diligence by the way. That one really hurt.\n\nThe other two occasions, I got approached by public companies directly and started negotiations, but realized that negotiation on my own behalf was a loser's game. I had no leverage and couldn't play hardball and was going to end up with a low offer so I backed out.\n\nCan't share exact multiples, but the final deal was with a PE firm, and was a solid lower middle-market transaction. Fortunately large majority was cash at closing with a small retained equity %, and a small earn-out component tied to growth over the time I stayed on as CEO.\n\nNowadays, I'm working with my son on ExitClarity, an exit readiness platform for business owners considering a sale. My mission really is to try to help others avoid all the mistakes that I made when trying to exit, and if I can do that, maybe it'll feel a little bit like it was worth it taking all those lumps haha.",

          "body": "I just sold my company after 26 years and 2 failed attempts. \n\nMy plan was to grow my company through acquisitions.  That is much harder than you think. After 2 solid years of trying to buy other companies,  I decided I needed an equity partner. \n\nIn the last 4 years, I have been approached at least 3 times per week by brokers, PE. And strategic buyers. I had no intention of selling. Then,  I started talking to them. I was offered an LOI  by a strategic that I really liked for a fair amount of money. I didn't really want to go that route so I declined after a lot of negotiations and soul searching.\n\n I was then approached by a holding company that offered me a platform position. Dream come true, right? They offered me great money, but during the negotiations, they kept changing the deal to the point that we both decided to walk away. \n\nThe M&amp;A advisor from the buyers' side then called me up and said they felt that my company was stronger than the offers I was getting, and they wanted to represent me. We came to an agreement, and they put me in front of 6 different buyers. PE, strategic, and a few other types. \n\nI just sold to my dream buyer. Great track record for growth. I named the terms of the deal and got a high multiple.  They are great to work with, and we are in full acquisition mode as a platform. \n\nIt took many years of building the company I would want to buy, but it paid off. The advice OP is giving is right on. Get an advisor, an M&amp;A CPA, and a good attorney.  You need a quality team. Your CPA will also need to advise you on tax consequences.

In my area it could easily do far more what it does now in events. It has a unique track record though, especially since I acquired it in January of 2021, and the previous owner was ill for several years prior to that, so it was flying by the seat of its pants for quite some time. I happily have a large scale corporate agent who has watched me rebuild it and has a high interest in a strategic partnership. I have another entertainment business (physical with a growing digital component) that I have spent 20+ years building that has global potential, and I would much rather focus on developing that for the next 3-5 years, so this would be a great way for me to work on that with some financial security behind me. But I am learning all this as I go!  The tips for the team to hire in this thread were immediately valuable.\n\n My questions are: How do I start thinking in terms of negotiating value of items, intellectual property compensation, or salaries or pay for team members? I know with this partnership it would be an immediate value addition to their bottom line, and I don't want to sell myself short. They already have trucks, warehouse space, and an administrative team we would integrate into. Without even trying this business easily does 60 events per year and could do 10x that if it had the resources (as demonstrated by a long established competitor) and someone (not me) who thrives on a higher level of activity. I will be bringing them hundreds of new talent members, a whole set of equipment that is ready to make money, a growing client base with dozens of repeat clients, multiple formulas for multiple markets, plus a business name that has been around for over 20 years with a 5 star reputation. Of course there is so much more to the story, but those are the most salient points I can think of to start.\n\nThere was one year where we did over 100 events and still could have booked more, but that was the year I learned what the term \"uncontrolled growth\" meant and I immediately set about controlling it. We grossed $250,000 that year, but this is a VERY people dependent business so that came with a lot of headaches from other people. So I decided I would only do what I knew I could handle with a small trusted crew. We still are easily into six figures, but it operates on a boutique family level at the moment. Various family members lend skill and expertise and it contributes a form of support at the moment for all of us involved. Those family members ideally would be integrated into the partnership to help the transition over the next couple years. \n\nThat was a lot, but things are moving fast (as they always do) so any input is welcome! And if this was just a casual read for anyone, thank you for making it this far!",

      "selftext": "Im 34 years old with a Mechanical engineering degree. I have been in corporate world since 2017 mainly in manufacturing, maintenance and facility engineering, and management experience. Ive done really cool things and built a pretty solid resume. Money has been great but im generally burned out. I several years back that I don't get fulfillment out of working for others but I stayed in the trap. I have my first child otw and I decided to leave a extremely well paying job with great benefits due to a horrible culture which honestly was turning into the worst version of myself. Hind sight, I believe i should have stayed at least until the baby was born and took my paternity leave but i figured if i didnt leave i probably never would. After i left in july, I started my own facilities and equipment consulting business. Ive been struggling on how to get things started even though I have the llc, website, business cards etc. I also dont really know how to sale, if that makes sense. I feel like im losing the fire thats in me that makes me, me. I believe i also have too much ego and pride that has been holding me back for the majority of my life, which i take full responsibility for. The burnout and loss of confidence honestly is tearing me apart as I have a pregnant wife and baby due in 3 weeks. We have a decent nest egg of savings but its tearing me apart as a man. How do I get the drive back and push through to do the one thing ive been wanting to do for years, which is have a business and work for myself. I understand there will be stress in any environment and im willing to grind through, no stranger to hard work. Has anyone experienced this and successfully started there business? Any advice is greatly appreciated. \n\nAlso to add, about 4 years ago we relocated to atlanta for my job and isolated our selves from all friends and family. I didnt realize how much of an impact it would have on me not being social and not having a team in your corner rooting for you. Again, this is all on me and having something to prove to myself at the time. My goal now is to be a good father, husband,  and to have fulfillment in my life with whatever job or business I do.",

The first few years were tough. There were small, incremental wins that kept me going, but after about four years, things finally started to take off. I was fortunate enough to sell that business at 39.  \n  \nA few years later, I started another venture, thinking my experience would help me fast-track success. It didn’t.

It's okay, but you really should focus on only one thing. It seems your family, because the main purpose is to be a good father and husband. Leave all the other stuff for a couple of months, spend more time with your wife and after birth with both of them. I assume she understands your mood and worries the same as you.

Alex Hormozi is a great one for business and specifically sales marketing. That may help.\nMake sure you're exercising. When I get mega stressed it's usually because I haven't moved or stretched in a while. Guard your health like your life depends on it. \nStarting a business usually fails for most because they give up after the first try. The first try often does not go well. \nIf you're having trouble selling hire a guy. If you can't afford to hire him, give him a fat commission. All the good guys I know are 100% commission \nGet a good job for now.  Keep that job and run your business on the side until you get some sales coming in and you can't afford to keep your regular job. Try and get a remote job. \nAbove all else: take care of your wife. Your kid will feel the tension in your relationship.

This is important so that you don't burn through tens of thousands of dollars on a dead business. I did this. The market will let you know if your idea or business makes sense. \n\nHonestly, most businesses fail especially on the first attempt. You have to invest in you and gain practical knowledge. Having a baby on the way is not the ideal time to start this full-time. \n\nI'd recommend you find at least a part time job and set realistic goals for business to test its viability. For example: close one client in 30 days. As you get more clients, you start to get a clearer idea of who to target. \n\nFinally invest in learning how to create ads for social media. If you are not ready to cold call, then shoot cold DMs. I wouldn't recommend emails yet because they go to spam and feels like more rejection when no one responds. That's my 2 cents.",

I was desperate to grow a portfolio to the point I started offering my services for free.\n\nStill no one accepted my services. After 3 months I got immediately burnt out and ended all operations until my one client that I kept told me that I could actually make a living doing my services.\n\nI didn't want to hear it and told them fuck no I hated everything I did for my llc. My client then told me \"You can chose what services you offer.\" That's when I gave it another go.\n\nHowever, I remember what this subreddit said to me and instead of going back to my llc, I completely rebranded, decided that I'm never going to create a portfolio or run ads. I came up with a brand true to me, an awkward autistic woman.\n\nAnd it worked. Owners who told me no before are now telling me yes. \n\nIt is all thanks to the only people that told me my llc was shit. \n\nLove you, r/smallbusiness",

I usually don’t use the word consultant because people don’t like it, but that’s what I am. I get it, a lot of people marketing themselves as consultants don’t provide value. If I don’t think I can provide value, I’ll decline and refer you to someone I think will. \n\nI’m probably at least “adjacent to the spectrum” (as my husband says). Not everyone wants to be friends with me but people who hire me appreciate that I’m no BS, all business, and I know what I’m talking about. If there are rules, schedules, or processes I know them better than anyone else and I will navigate you through it. And you’re paying a decent hourly rate so I’m not here to waste anyone’s time. I’m busy enough anyway. People appreciate that, usually.\n\nI don’t remember your post, but the haters aren’t wrong. Most people fail at this.

Everyone does that.   Not play games, but waste time. Its part of having a job.  But bosses are obsessed about time and not tasks.   25 years ago I was a service manager at a car dealership. The owner insisted everyone clock out at 5pm. Not early.  So during the last 15 minutes of the day people would just stand in a line by the time clock, waiting until exactly 5pm.  So much money wasted. And time.  I've noticed that bosses care more about employees being unhappy that actually getting work done.   I also spent time as a buyer for a company. I could have layed in bed at home and called the places and did the work. Would have been more effective most likely. But I had to go into work, sit at a desk, wear a suit even though nobody from the public was ever in our building, and make calls there.  Half the day I was just sitting there waiting on hold or waiting to make a call.  \n\nThe biggest thing is the person being late or calling off.  That drives me crazy.   Employees that show up are super valuable.   I've ignored employees stealing thousands of dollars from me just because they actually showed up each day and never called off lol. \n\nI'm going to assume you are a new business owner since you are asking these questions.

          "body": "My parents co-owned a small business and worked together for 30+ years. During that time, they hired a senior manager named Phil. Phil had broad responsibilities, including purchasing inventory. Over the years, it became clear to them that Phil had deals with some of the vendors for kickbacks paid to him and some other shady dealings. Basically, they knew that Phil was stealing 1-2% of what he was purchasing, which amounted to $100k+ per year.\n\nMy dad told me this, and I (naturally!) asked why he didn't fire Phil on the spot. His reply was a business lesson that stuck with me over the decades since.\n\n\"I could let him go, of course. But I prefer to look at that 1-2% as part of the cost of doing business. Sure, Phil costs the company money with his theft, but he is also so fiercely protective of his grift that he makes sure we get a good deal anyway, so we won't suspect him. Plus, he watches all the other employees like a hawk to ensure they're not skimming, so we won't get suspicious. This way, your mom and I can take a two week vacation if we want to, and we know it costs 1-2%. We can stomach that, and it's worth it for us. Is it right? No. But it's practical.\"\n\nSo, ask yourself - if this employee came to you and said, \"I'll keep doing a great job, but I'm going to steal $100/month worth of time and supplies. Is that OK?\" What would you say? If you'd agree to keep this person, then just pretend that conversation happened and move on. It costs a lot more to find, train, and keep another manager.\n\nIs it right to let this guy steal $10 worth of supplies? Or 40 minutes worth of time? No. But perhaps it's practical.",

I moved to a new city last year and in my old city there was a big scene for marketers with meetups and conferences every week, so I wanted to start something similar here. \n\nI spent $100 on the venue, $100+ on catering, spent money on flyers, and spent a lot of time making the presentation I was going to give, hanging up flyers at dozens of local businesses, meeting business owners, and promoting on meetup.com, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. Several people RSVP'd and I had close to 50 people interested or saying they would come including my friends. I promoted the event with my small team every day for 5 weeks sending reminders just enough to not be annoying. \n\nI got there and set everything up and... nothing. No one came. One person had been asking me questions on meetup named Curtis and I saw one person there who looked like him so I went up to say hello and introduced myself and he looked at me strange and said his name was Shawn and it was nice to meet me. SO AWKWARD. I casually played it off and left him alone, then waited 30+ minutes after the start time by the front door of the venue like some kind of 1970's breakup song to see if anyone would show before packing up my stuff and going home. \n\nNext month I was planning a follow up and was going to have a guest speaker come out, but now I'm thinking of emailing him (a respected name in my field) and canceling next month because it would embarrass me even more. \n\nMaybe Thursday nights aren't good? Maybe 6:30pm is a bad time for a business event? Maybe my offer wasn't good enough? Maybe something else was going on last night that I didn't know about? Maybe I should have tried paid ads on the radio or Facebook instead? Maybe I should try changing it to Saturday and pay a big name to appear? Maybe this town isn't interested in marketing and I need to try the big city 30 minutes away?\n\nI guess I'm just venting into the void here. I used to be in bands and I've definitely played shows where no one came, so this is nothing new, but it's never fun to go through it. \n\n\n\nI realize I'm not good at in-person event promotion and need to keep trying things until I make progress.",

We've been working all day and want to relax in a chill setting. Take a few minutes at some point to thank any sponsors, caterers, etc. Ask for feedback for future events, and ask people to think about who they would invite to the next one to make this better for everyone. If you tell me theres a speaker and it starts at 5:30, if I cant make it on time, im not going to show up AT ALL. (LOL show up late in the middle of a speaker's presentation? How embarrassing! Sorry I couldn't make it!)\n\n\n- Make it a networking event where they can promote themselves and their business, and mingle with other professionals. If you make it 5-7, people can drift in and out. Some people can leave work early, some will show up late, and people can come and go as they please.\n\n\n- I need to stress this needs to be an opportunity for the networkers to meet new people and expand into new markets. The main attraction needs to be the attendees. All the successful independent networking events I go to do this. The host NEVER spends time peddling their own product; they go mingle and build relationships just like everyone else has to. Don't worry, people will remember you and that you hosted the events.\n\n\n- See if you can find a venue you can pay for where drinks are available. A slower night at a restaurant with a bar or something. Buy some appetizers but tell everyone to support your host and buy a drink! Give the venue host a minute to speak if they want.\n\n- As you grow ask if people have swag or door prizes to donate. Put business cards in a bowl for drawings (must be present to win, keeps some people there longer). \"We have a gift card here for a free 30 minute massage from Queen Spa.\" \"Up next is a branded tumbler from Reddit Bank and trust!\" \"A floral arrangement made by Flowers Unlimited, donated as a prize from Care Today Urgent Care. Thank you Care Today for this lovely prize. Let's see who's taking it home!\"\n\nTL;DR: no speakers, make it easy to come and go, find a venue (and give the venue an opportunity to make money aka the bar, also buy some appetizers), and focus is on the people attending. This is for them and about them.\n\nP.S. take this with a grain of salt I am tall, white, and handsome. Sample size of 1 and a lot of those factors probably play more into that than my actual ability.\n\nP.P.S. I'm not saying I'm handsome as a brag. I just realized its a factor, and I found out because when my wife goes with me to networking events, she extends her hand to shake the hand of EVERY SINGLE OTHER WOMAN that approaches us at light speed. \"Hi I'm xxx, Hailhydra's wife. Nice to meet you.\" Before she did this, other women ive known a long time through networking would come up and we'd give each other a hug. She put a stop to that quick lol.\n\nP.P.P.S my mom said I was handsome too. So sample size of...2?",

Gather way more feedback from people who match your target attendee persona. \n\nFrankly, I'm more of a fan of pitching the idea in detail and then getting people to pay for a ticket in advance before you even start setting up the event. Try Reddit, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.. \n\nIn this way, if it flops, you've wasted no time and money, saved yourself a lot of effort and heartbreak, and ruled out that particular event idea. You can validate ideas and demand in this way without wasting money, time, effort, and other resources.\n\nHowever, I'm not familiar with in-person events.

Saying this so you can understand I might know quite a bit about what is going on here.\n\nFor people saying 6:30 is too late, I completely disagree. It's actually the most perfect time you could be doing it. All of my events are either at Lunch OR 6:30pm.\n\nSo several things. 1. If the goal of the event is to talk to people and you had Curtis already reaching out and asking questions why not just jump on a call with him? That to me, feels like an immediate win with a lot of upside. Even giving you the immediate ability to pitch something.\n\n2. Your venue will absolutely make or break your event. Pubs will always have extremely low turn out. Especially if you are Targeting professionals. Want to know where you can have meetups that won't cost you anything? Coffee shops like Panera Bread.\n\nMy first several meetups were at Paneras or Starbucks and once I grew the groups to around 30 people consistently coming out, I was able to use that to get bigger venues to donate the space, like co-working spaces. Especially if you have people in tech or marketers because they love having remote offices they can work out of. Best part, Panera is free. They just want folks there to buy snacks or coffee. So you save all of that money alone. Several hundred dollars in your pocket now.\n\nI am a very big believer in Value for time and a meetup will break if you don't figure out what that looks like. What is the value for their time being there, driving there, and then driving home. If they are THINKING about driving there and can't figure out what the value is, they will just make a turn and go home instead of going there.\n\nHope this gives you some ideas and if you want to DM me or reach out to ask more, happy to explain more.",

I’ve had a few meetups there with mixed success. But I never reserve the space and I don’t cater it. I don’t have presentations either. It’s just for folks to hang out and talk shop.\n\nOf course being the organizer you get to meet everyone and they will remember your name even if they forget everyone else. I also make a point to pull out my phone and connect with each person using LinkedIn at some point.\n\nThis requires zero dollars since everyone pays their own way. It’s low cost and low commitment. Pretty much just show up. If things go well and you develop a good routine group or return folks, talk to them about changing up the format. People like to help, and it helps you not have to do all the work.\n\nI agree on 5:30 timing and I’ve also found that having free parking available and making sure your location isn’t in the center of rush hour snarl helps too.\n\nGood luck!",

We don’t really focus on clicks or impressions anymore, those can drain budget fast. With LSA, you’re paying only when an actual lead calls or messages you, which makes it way easier to track ROI.\n\nWhen you combine that with solid local SEO, it’s a strong setup, SEO builds long-term visibility, and LSA keeps leads coming in consistently week to week.\n\nIt takes some tweaking to get the targeting and reviews right, but once it’s dialed in, it’s super reliable.  \nHappy to help more if you want, DM me. :)",

These hotels aren’t in great shape, but they’re far from ruins... they’re fully operational and listed on Booking.\n\nSome prices are wild (for example, found this one with [50 rooms for €450,000](https://www.buythathotel.com/listing/scenic-hotel-for-sale-in-tabiano-terme)). Of course, they’re not in top locations like Lake Como or the Amalfi Coast, but... it’s still Italy, with its culture, great food.\n\nAll the ones I’ve looked at are run by elderly owners who just want to retire. They have zero tech or marketing skills and haven’t invested much in the properties over the past decade.\n\nSo I figured that with some alternative concepts, like coliving, it would be nearly impossible not to make money (or at least be able to sell in a few years for a profit). Bureaucracy will probably be an issue, but that’s the case everywhere in Southern Europe.\n\nSo what’s the catch?",

This spans across industries - hardly anyone has a website, and if they do it looks like one from the 1990's.   \n  \n2 - Italians really seem to like to preserve the traditional things - e.g., in my part of Liguria, they actively discourage street performers, creative artists, any non-Italian cuisine. There is a lot of local government regulation put into preserving the status quo. (this has pros and cons but for your purposes, probably a con)  \n  \n3 - You really should look into the tax situation and labor rights. You will quickly find that the economics are really tough and entrepreneurial success is essentially disincentivized big time, IMO. As a result, 'bare bones' businesses seem to be the norm - both my veterinarian and my optometrist have no web presence, make appointments by texts via WhatsApp, and they are the receptionist, the doctor, the accounting department and the cleaning staff in their business. i.e. sole proprietors, no employees.   \n  \nGood luck!",

Run a ln hotel in Milan can be really different from running an hotel in the south.\nYou may both have success in making a capsule hotel or a real rural and traditional hotel but you need to know where it is located.\nThat said be prepared to pay for really High labour costs (skyrocketed by taxes you have to pay for the worker if u hire him).\nIn general nobody here is against a foreigner owner, but they will tell you how to handle the hotel because people will expect Italian logics and standards.\nDon't expect a neutral management.\nThe cheap costs may require, by contract, you to restore the building if you buy it and so on.",

Italy's bureaucracy can be challenging, especially if you are a foreigner who can't speak Italian.

In doing so, my client ended up in the “To” field and the vendor in “cc.” Later that week, he actually scolded me for it on a call.\n\nI was surprised because I can’t see how that would have had any practical effect. The vendor still got the message and replied to it. I get that it’s a small etiquette thing, but to me it feels like a non-issue.\n\nNow he’s also started raising his voice at the vendor on calls, accusing them of being unprofessional when I honestly think they weren’t. I’m leaning toward ending the relationship, but I’d like to sanity-check myself first.\n\nWas I really out of line with that email, or is this just another sign that the client is being unreasonable?",

Trump and his cronies are dividing up the carcass of the United States. They are accelerating the fall so they can be the ones in power when it collapses with plenty of Fart Coin available in their personal coffers so they can buy up the pieces just like the Russian oligarchs did for state-owned companies after the fall of the Soviet Union.

And my customer base is US manufacturers, who are also doing surprisingly well.\n\n\n\nI'm an importer as a service. I import components for US manufacturers. All of it comes from China. They use those components in their US manufacturing facility to assemble into their finished good.\n\nMy business is up this year.\n\n  \nI can only speak for myself and what my clients are doing/ told me. Other's experiences are their own. \n\nAs of last week, to date, I had only had one order cancelled due to the tariffs. They decided to make it in-house. Which they were tooled up to do.\n\nThat particular good, the tariff is 98%. The economics of it, that's not 98% increase in cost. Tariffs were already 28% before all this. So though 70% is a big increase, not terrible when you look at the overall impact to the client. That +70% on EXW. Which means before tariff, freight, my markup. Then it's their COG. Which, the actual cost of goods portion of their cost, is relatively small.\n\nThen this week, they decided to order through me from China anyway. What they calculated was that their cost to make it in house, was about the same as importing it. So by importing it, he's got his employees working on developing new products. \n\nSo in the end, now haven't lost any business due to the tariff. I was able to absorb some of the extra, and they are absorbing some. So far, as far as I know, none of my clients have had to increase their cost to the consumer. Though again, that's clearly because of the structure of me targeting US manufacturers, and how the actual percent that affects everything being minor. For those who import finished goods to sell to the consumer, it must be brutal.\n\nBeyond that, the 98% is a rare occurrence for my stuff. Most of my stuff is between 50-60%. Which it was 25-30% before. So not a huge increase. And again, it's still on EXW vs COG. So I absorb it for the most part. Sure, lower margin for me. But i'm getting more orders than before because that's how my US manufacturer clients are choosing to reduce cost.\n\nSo I am gaining market share. I'm getting more business. So i'm doing better than ever.",

Our labor cost per hour has risen 40%, and the costs of materials has risen a bit. I am intentionally pricing out some services and directing work we do not prefer to my competition/colleagues.\n\nThe only positive aspect here is that being a small lutherie in a big city is that we have to do it all. If we can’t get new instruments in from China, then we will no longer expand our rental program which will hurt a lot of families but we are primarily a manufacturer of instruments, ourselves. We have hundreds of old instruments people have donated to us over the years. We will now be restoring and making only if this continues too long. I would be sawing the trees down myself if needed and if the good wood was not from Bosnia.\n\nAdaptability will always be the key to human survival, in every facet.

Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries all up 20-30%. Pineapple, Kiwi up 15%. Gloves up 40%, Customized bowls up 50%. Even spoons up 30%, and so much other stuff. \n\nWe tried to fight it with waste control, portion control, labor control, adding higher-margin items, etc. It kinda helped at first, but eventually we decided to raise prices by $1 across the board this following Monday. However, everything keeps going up and not going to stop. \n\nThe problem is, you can’t just keep increasing prices every month. Customers can only handle so much before they start walking because fundamentally they are still getting the same check, if not less. It’s honestly insane right now. And it’s scary seeing how many restaurants are shutting down lately around us. \n\nSo I’m just wondering, what’s your current situation like? How are you guys managing to survive this mess?\n",

Not doing so well. We moved UPSCALE over a year ago.  Be sure your advertising and product offerings meet the needs of older more affluent consumers.  You will do well. In the meanwhile, interest rates are dropping which should really help out.  Again. Focus on the top 25% and older consumers.",

I used excersise as the main driver but also having really busy weekends off helped. Up at 6am and filled the day with stuff. It could be gym at 7-8, cook a good breakfast, a walk in the park from 9-11am then a coffee date with my partner and then a trip into the city in the afternoon, then a cheap comedy show in the evening. Do two days like that and Monday comes around and you feel like you've not thought about work forever. The worst thing you can do in my opinion is spend a whole weekend doing a couple things as your brain when your painting is probably mostly on autopilot and drifts to work stuff, at least mine does all the time.

You can’t expect yourself to perform well in any business or job if your body and mind are on life support.\n\nGo for walks, take small breaks throughout the day, go to the gym, play video games, read books, eat healthy food, etc.\n\nDo what you like to do so you don’t get burnt out. Running a business is not a sprint or cramming for an exam, it’s a marathon where you need to prepare and take care of yourself first to do well.

While our financial performance appears to be satisfactory on paper and operationally, we continue to incur a monthly loss of approximately $16,000.\n\nOur weekly sales exceed $45,000, with a gross profit margin of approximately 64% and a wage expense of 28%. However, the primary contributor to our financial challenges is the substantial amount we allocate to delivery aggregators. This month, despite a total sales of $237,000 (representing five weeks according to the retail calendar), we incurred approximately $37,000 in payments to Uber and DoorDash.\n\nDespite these substantial sales figures, we persist in operating at a loss. Given our limited capacity as a franchise, what strategies can I implement to improve our financial situation? \n\nEdit: Another problem is, I have a gym next door and we have a shared drive-way with them. The gym customers take all the parking spots, even they park on the driveway. This makes it extremely difficult for drivers to-thru customers. My google review is full with people cursing gym folks for their bad parking practices. I get only 400 cars per week in my drive-thru as opposed to 1700 in a drive-thru of another store situated in quieter road than mine. ",

Offer a small discount for direct orders (still cheaper than 28% commission).\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Delivery zone optimization\\*\\* - Are you delivering too far? Tightening your radius can cut delivery times and costs. Most customers order within 3km anyway.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Minimum order value\\*\\* - If you're not already doing this, set minimums that make the economics work. Better to lose a $15 order than subsidize it.\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Ghost kitchen model\\*\\* - Some franchises are shifting to delivery-only locations with lower overhead. Could you test a smaller, cheaper location for delivery orders only?\n\n\n\n5. \\*\\*Negotiate with aggregators\\*\\* - At your volume, you have leverage. Many will reduce commission if you commit to exclusivity or higher volume.\n\n\n\nThe real question: What's your customer acquisition cost through aggregators vs other channels? If they're bringing NEW customers who become regulars, the fee might be worth it short-term.\n\n\n\nWhat's your current split between aggregator orders vs direct orders?",

The brutal math here is that youre paying roughly 15.6% of total revenue just to delivery aggregators, which when combined with your 28% labor costs is eating up almost half your gross profit before you even touch rent, utilities, or other overhead. What most franchise owners dont realize is that you can actually negotiate better rates with these platforms once you hit certain volume thresholds, plus theres consolidation software that can help manage multiple platform orders through one system so you dont miss orders during peak times. At vGrubs we work with restaurants to aggregate all their delivery platforms into one dashboard and help optimize their delivery operations to actually turn those orders profitable instead of just break-even customer acquisition tools.\n\nThe parking situation is probably costing you way more than the delivery fees though since drive-thru customers typically have much higher profit margins than delivery orders.",

We work with tons of restaurants at Kea AI and that 15-16% you're paying to delivery platforms is just insane when you're already operating on thin margins. The math just doesn't work for most places.\n\nHere's what I've seen work for similar situations. First, you gotta start building your own direct ordering channel aggressively. Since you're on a busy roadway with good drive-thru traffic, focus on converting those customers to order direct next time. Simple stuff like receipt inserts with a discount code for direct orders, or even just training staff to mention \"next time you can skip the wait and order ahead on our app.\" The goal is getting people off those expensive platforms gradually.\n\nSecond thing is optimizing your phone orders since thats free revenue. Make sure every call gets answered professionally because missed calls during lunch rush are literally money walking away. A lot of places lose thousands just from unanswered phones when they're busy. Even something as simple as a proper phone system that queues calls instead of going to voicemail can help capture more of that direct business.\n\nThe delivery platforms aren't going anywhere but you dont have to be completely dependent on them. Start tracking what percentage of your sales come from each channel and set a goal to reduce that delivery platform percentage by even 5% over the next few months. With your volume that could save you almost $1000 monthly. Small changes add up fast when you're doing $45k+ weekly.",

      "selftext": "I own a business that exports from the US to a significant number of clients abroad (mostly Canada, Europe, and South America). It’s been so difficult and time consuming trying to get clear information on how the tariffs work in practice. We sell something worth $50 and the client ends up paying almost 100% tax when you add up shit like the “broker fee” that UPS adds and a bunch of other surcharges. I can’t even accurately quote clients for shipments because suddenly they’ll get hit with an unexpected charge. And for a couple of bigger clients I’ve ended up paying the fee myself to save face. But even then it’s lost business, and a massive burden. I’ve wasted hours on the phone with UPS Mumbai Team. This is worse than a tax and it’s been a roller coaster trying to run a business without having predictable numbers. I feel the biggest winner here is UPS and whoever the “brokers” are that charge more than the actual tariff. I can’t comprehend how any of this is acceptable to anyone, let alone the party of “small government”. Everyday it’s fucking something in this timeline",

But then under \"Contact a Lender\" it literally named two of their competitors by name. It straight up told people to call these other businesses. \n\n  \nAlthough their site was mentioned in the carousel, it wasn't mentioned in the answer at all. \n\nThat query was high intent, and although the users domain ranks top 5 in the blue links and was included in the carousel, it wasn't referred and they got cut out compeletely. \n\n  \nI'd honestly recommend everyone here to take 5 mins asking Google/ChatGPT/Perplexity etc questions about your business and see what happens. Are you getting recommended (not just in the carousel but in the answer) or is your competiton. \n\nFull disclosure, my work is in this space, so I'm looking at these results all day and thought it was an important warning to share with other business owners who rely on search for customers. \n\nAnyone else seeing stuff like this in their industry?

Missing calls while you're hooking up a car meant losing the next job to competitors.\n\nWhat saved my sanity was getting systems in place for the repetitive stuff. Like we started using Marlie AI to handle all our incoming calls 24/7 - picks up every single one, books the jobs, takes payments. Before that i was losing my mind trying to answer phones at 3am while driving to a breakdown. Now the AI handles it all and texts me the job details. Also started requiring deposits for long distance tows after getting burned twice.\n\nYour dad probably has years of systems built up that he doesn't even think about anymore. That's the difference - he's automated the boring parts of his brain. Keep pushing through, it gets easier once you stop doing everything manually. And definitely get contracts signed before starting ANY work. Learned that one the hard way when a customer claimed we damaged their car (we didn't) and tried to skip paying.",

Sometimes it's stressful because you never know what the next day will bring, but you work and persevere. You find what works and adjust what doesn't. \n\nIf you don't, I highly recommend networking. Not just for potential customers, but others in similar industries. Sometimes bouncing things off others in a similar situation over a cocktail can be huge. And honestly, some of the best customers I've gotten came about over candid conversation.  I started networking years before I started my business, and its one of the best investments with my time outside of my contracts.\n\nMake sure you have someone looking over your finances as well, even if just at first.  Making sure you are making the most out of your cash is huge.  Making the best decisions for deductions, investing in your company to maximize effectiveness and deductions, ect...

Since my business is pretty new, I've also noticed that if you search up my store, the Reddit thread shows up right underneath my website. I am sure this has scared away some potential customers.\n\nI am also pretty sure that I know who the creator of the thread is (not personally). Recently, I had denied a refund on my store for a customer (I had a no refund policy clearly stated on my website), and I am certain that it is him. He has also either created multiple accounts or has got his friends to comment on the thread, the same reviews, just slightly refined\n\nI was just wondering if there was a way to remove this Reddit thread from the internet, or at least remove the comments. I just basically would like this thread to not show up when people search for my business. And also I do not want to ask him directly to remove it because I am scared that he will see that it is hurting my conversion rate and will add more negative reviews.

What you're dealing with is basically a Search Party problem - when negative content ranks high for your brand searches, you need to push it down rather than trying to make it disappear. The solution isn't removal, its displacement. You need to create more content that will rank above that thread when people search your business name. Start pumping out blog posts, get featured in industry publications, create social media profiles, maybe even do some PR outreach to local business publications. The goal is to flood the first page of search results with positive content about your business so that Reddit thread gets buried on page 2 where nobody looks. Also consider reaching out to happy customers for testimonials and reviews on Google, Yelp, whatever platforms make sense for your industry. I've seen this approach work really well because you're not fighting the negative content directly, you're just making it irrelevant by giving searchers better, more recent information about your business first.",

I agree being in person is important but the issue is that your vision does not align with the type of talent that you need. IT people don’t like to be in the office. If it works with your company, build in the in office atmosphere with non-IT people. Being a leader is definitely more fun with an in office atmosphere so I get it so don’t just drop that vision entirely imo. if it’s important to you, it’s important to you.",

          "body": "The current market is based on a lot of lies. People believe they can do as they please. If you are a small business owner, it's likely that they take what you give them (knowledge, insight, business secrets) and think they can do the same thing.\n\nSometimes you can be too good to people, and today there are way more takers than givers. People watch these social media videos of becoming a millionaire in 24 hours, live your life on your own terms with your own company.\n\nBeing a good and nice business owner can sometimes backfire. People often don't respect that anymore. They want what you have; they don't do it to Google or Amazon because they don't necessarily care about their employees. Everyone is replaceable because they can easily get more people, whether here or overseas.\n\nI owned several businesses and had to deal with it myself until I got to a point that, sure, from an \"employee\" perspective, they want you to be a good boss, treat you well, give you work-life balance, and so on, but the thing is, you can offer all of that, eventually they want even more and more because they want what you have.\n\nLook at Starbucks; I remember when they were a reputable company, praised for paying decent wages with good benefits. Now, it's different. People strike to wear what they want and to oppose a dress code meant for the company's well-being. In the end, who loses? Many are now unemployed and complaining. Ultimately, does Starbucks really owe them anything, or have they just taken things too far for what they are?\n\nAs a business owner, you will always face these issues. It' nature's law. People respect those who treat them poorly more than those who want to be good to them",
