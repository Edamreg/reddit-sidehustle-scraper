I’m nowhere near being able to quit my job, but it’s enough for me to work here and there as I have spare time and build up a catalog of content to sell. It’s ebooks, for adults. With nsfw content. 😂 go figure people want that kind of stuff. Anyways, I sell it on some different storefronts and build up a readership following me. I’d say half is AI, but the other half is good creativity, else you just get lost in the storm of bad AI content. Anyhow, if anyone wants to know more, it’s pretty specialized stuff and most people don’t make much. But it’s possible. And from what I can tell, there are a lot of people out there making a lot of money in the same sort of niche. I also sell custom stories too, which I can partially make with AI. And though that’s more work, I have made almost $2k this year from 5 of those sales!",

Just moved it online and will be doing farmer's markets in summer to expand and extend the season. Started with about $1,000 10 years ago. Hoping to double my income, but we'll see.\n\nMy previous one was selling jewelry and accessories on eBay. I did that for about 5 years, and it helped me through some very tough financial times. I had a fun store where most people bought several items and often came back. That netted $2K-$5K/month depending on the season.\n\nAnother one that was super successful for a year ($100K that year) about 15 years ago was self-publishing books. I got lucky with a few that went viral. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to keep writing for myself, but I'm working on it now. I have several books going through the pipeline, and my launches will start in January. I have three niches I'm working in, but one is starting to stand out as having more potential.",

Each company has different requirements, but they're usually pretty clear about them. \n\nI tend to focus on Baker Creek, because they pay really well and their contracts are forgiving if things go wrong. And things will go wrong sometimes! But just be open and honest about it, they know what plants are like. They'll understand.\n\nYou can be a contract grower with any amount of space. For small gardens they'll probably focus on herbs and flowers. Large gardens and farms, they might ask you to grow 100 pounds of dry beans, or 500 eggplants, stuff like that.\n\nI'm a little obsessive about plants, so this works for me. I've tried selling seeds directly to customers, and I just don't have the people skills or the executive function needed for that! For me, mass-growing and then selling to a big company is the best fit for my skills and personality.\n\nI'm hoping to expand soon, but I'm \"between houses\" at the moment and had to take a break from contract growing entirely.",

Figured I'd share what I found since most of the content out there is people regurgitating stuff they've never actually tried. The \"start an AI content agency\" advice needs to die. The market is completely flooded. Everyone jumped on this in early 2024 and now you're competing with thousands of people offering the same thing. Same deal with AI-generated art on print-on-demand sites. I tried this for two months and made literally $12. The designs all look the same and the market is buried in AI slop. What's actually worked for me is way less sexy. I started helping local businesses with basic AI stuff — not pitching them on \"AI solutions\" but just helping a dentist's office write better emails or showing a realtor how to speed up their listing descriptions. These people are like two years behind on this stuff and they're happy to pay someone to just figure it out for them. I also make decent money from Notion templates for a specific niche, but that took months to get traction. The uncomfortable part nobody talks about is the timeline. Nothing made real money in month one. It took me until month three or four before I was consistently hitting $300-500. Anyone promising faster results is trying to sell you a course. Curious what's actually working for other people who've moved past the \"I watched a YouTube video\" stage.",

What’s actually working today is unsexy, hyper-specific help for people who are behind on AI.\n\nWhat’s been working for me is using AI as a thinking partner with local professionals. Not selling them “AI solutions,” just helping them make better decisions faster. Example: breaking down a dentist’s patient communication flow, rewriting the scripts with AI, and helping staff use it daily. Small wins, but they pay because it saves them real time.\n\nThe pattern I’m seeing:\n\n1. Pick one profession that’s 2–3 years behind the curves.\n2. Sit with them, watch their workflow.\n3. Use AI to remove 20–30 minutes of pain from a task they repeat all week.\n4. Charge monthly for ongoing support, not one-off projects.\n\nIt’s not flashy. It’s slow for the first couple months. But once one person in that niche gets value, they refer you to others.\n\nCurious what niches others are seeing traction in.

Small items, easy to list on marketplaces like ebay and ship em out. But I also see SO many people doing this and prices seem super competitive. I'm worried about getting scammed or dealing with returns when someone says it stopped working.   \n  \nThen I look at furniture, decor, vintage kitchen stuff etc. Seems like way less competition and people will pay surprisingly good money for the right pieces. Just saw someone in my area sell a mid century dresser for like $300. Downside is obviously you can't ship a couch and storage becomes an issue fast. My garage is already pretty full lol  \n  \nDoes anyone have experience with both? Like if you had to pick one lane which would actually be more profitable long term? I've got maybe $300-400 to invest upfront if that matters. Also doing this part time so I can't be spending 8 hours a day sourcing or whatever  \n  \nWould really appreciate any advice from people who've been doing this for a while!!",

Price $50-$100 per task.\n3. **Turn repeat work into a bundle** (templates + checklist) and sell it on Whop for passive sales.\n4. **Batch once a week** (2-3 hrs) so it doesn’t bleed into family time.\n5. **Upsell retainers** after 2-3 jobs for predictable monthly income.\n\nThis avoids ads, cold calls, and heavy setup - just focused, repeatable wins from home.",

This dividend thing took maybe 10 hours total to research and set up initially, now I just exist and money appears.\n\nThe math is pretty simple though, at 4% yield you need roughly $45k invested to make $150 monthly, which sounds like a lot but it builds faster than you think with regular contributions and reinvesting. My goal is getting to $500 monthly within a few years which would cover my car payment without working extra hours.\n\nNot saying everyone should do this or that it's easy money, just pointing out that if you're looking for actual passive income that doesn't require ongoing time investment, dividends beat pretty much every other side hustle once you get it going.",

If you truly have 18 hours a day, that’s a weapon, but only if you pick ONE thing and go deep.\n\nSome realistic paths that don’t need money to start:  \n– Learn a simple service skill (editing, design, automation, outreach) and sell it to people already making money  \n– Learn how to build and sell small digital products (templates, checklists, scripts) around a specific problem  \n– Learn basic AI + workflow tools and help non-technical people use them  \n– Learn content + distribution (how posts actually get attention on Reddit, Twitter, etc.)\n\nThe key isn’t the niche. It’s committing to something for 30–60 days without switching every week. Boredom usually comes from lack of progress, not lack of options. Once you see even a small result, motivation follows fast.",

Internet, computer, tons of time, but no idea where to actually start or what to commit to.\n\nWhat helped me was not looking for “the best hustle” but first picking something I was genuinely curious about and could do with a computer. For me that was programming. I didn’t know where to start, so I zoomed out and looked at the bigger picture: web development. Then I saw frontend, backend, full stack, read a bit about each, and chose full stack simply because it sounded more interesting to me.\n\nOnce I picked that, I looked up which technologies are actually in demand right now and which ones caught my attention. After that, I used ChatGPT very intentionally. I asked it what languages and tools I should learn for those technologies and then asked it to create an 80/20 list of the specific topics I should study for them, focused only on what’s actually useful.\n\nFor each topic, I’d ask for a clear explanation, a practical example, and a small task to complete. I saved code and useful notes in an organized way so I could come back to them later. That structure alone helped a lot with consistency.\n\nAt the same time, since I want to make money online sooner rather than later, I also started learning smaller, low-barrier skills like creating SRT captions and similar tasks. Same approach: pick one thing I’m actually interested in, build a focused topic list, and work through it step by step instead of jumping around.",

Give us specifics on the steps you took for each of these:\n\n* selling your art\n* Amazon KDP low-content books\n* POD\n* selling stuff online\n\nI've found from personal experience that all the things I \"failed at\" were things I didn't actually follow through on. \n\nLike - when I first started a blog (back in 2008, when you literally could get monetized after a couple of weeks just writing about a game on your iphone), I got approved for AdSense, then got bored and abandoned it instead of finding a niche I actually loved and sticking with it. So ... no millions from AdSense.\n\nGot approved for Amazon Affiliate - wrote a few blog posts and gave up because it wasn't converting \"fast enough\" for my liking. Guess what? If I'd done even ONE BF promo or a \"gift ideas for Christmas\" kind of post and *promoted it*, I'd have made enough to make me stick with it. So ... no millions from Amazon Affiliate.\n\nGot approved for Amazon Merch .... same story.\n\nDo you see the pattern here? It's not enough to START. You need to stick with something long enough to give it time to work, rather than giving up after a short while. \n\nPick a thing. Anything. Figure out how to get it online. \n\n***Do some actual promotion.*** &lt;- Without this, no online venture can succeed these days, there's just TOO much noise out there. So you'll need to put money into ads (the quickest way to get people to see what you're selling, and to buy, but you risk spending a lot of money if you don't know what you're doing and don't keep an eagle eye on that ad spend). Or you'll need to spend money figuring out how else to get discovered - either by posting regularly or by partnering with someone who does know what they're doing and can get you sales.\n\nYouTube can help you figure out where you're stumbling in a particular venture. Can help you get past the obstacles. More than any course you can buy, you'll learn by actually DOING the thing and figuring out how to get past the roadblocks. And there are roadblocks in everything we try that is new to us.\n\nGood luck. If you stick with something long enough, I can promise you you'll learn enough to make it work.",

          "body": "I'm not sure what you meant by selling your art, but if it was on Etsy, that's a LONG game. And even then, you're not guaranteed to be seen with all the other million of sellers. The people that do best on Etsy are the ones with a good social media following. \n\nI've been selling on Etsy since 2014 and it's not a big money maker for me. Partly because I can't scale my handmade items even if they did catch on. But I make enough to keep me going, giving me a small profit for a small bit of work.\n\nI don't have a social media presence, but I do okay. It took from 2014 - 2017 of learning Etsy SEO (which is not at all like Google SEO or eBay SEO), finding what works in my niche, oh and the biggie is to **have a niche**. Can you say exactly what your art is and identify a particular person and not generally 'people who have bulletin boards'? \n\nFor instance, I sell push pins, but my niche is Kawaii Cute style, and I only sell push pins.\n\nIf I need money, then selling things around the house on eBay is usually my best option, too. I was lucky my daughter was into collectibles figures, and even though (or because?) she played with them, they sold well. Sometimes I go to charity shops and find Barbie or My Little Pony things and those sell well. Even when selling on eBay, get a niche. Niches sell better than just throwing things up. When I sell on eBay it's usually toys. And because of that I now have an eye for what toys sell.\n\nIf I went around and just bought random things, I'd have more misses (things that don't sell) than hits with fast selling items.\n\nPeople are not making millions with PDFs unless the PDF is in a specific niche that people need.\n\nOn Etsy, there is a person that does make a lot of money with Excel spreadsheets. But she is very good with Excel and is able to do good customer service since she understands Excel and how people will mess up the formulas.  She can also customize the Excel spreadsheets for what Etsy sellers need. \n\nIf you have a strength that someone needs for their business, then that's the way to go. Her shop is successful (in my opinion) due to word of mouth. When I see on Etsy seller forums someone asking for accounting help, they will mention this shop and say they liked her forms. These cost about $100 each, but people buy them because she is good at what she does.\n\nPOD is always tough, even if you have your own artwork. There are so much POD shirts (etc) that it's hard to get seen. At one time (Etsy has been cracking down a little bit on this) people would buy a design on CreativeFabrica and without changing a thing stick it on a POD shirt. At one time if you looked up Be Kind t-shirt you'd see over 1,000 listings of the exact same \"Be Kind\" with Boho rainbow in the same colors, all the listings one after another. This made Etsy search a bit boring, so Etsy did crack down and reminded people that the seller has to change the design significantly enough for it to be unique. \n\nEven so, POD is not the road to riches. One youtuber showed how much he made with POD shirts. With advertising (which he said he needed) he made $1.00 for each shirt. Without Advertising he made something like $3 or so on POD shirts. When he started printing his own shirts in his garage he ended up with about $10 profit from each shirt, but as you can imagine that is a lot of work. \n\nNow he is an Etsy Coach. I don't even think that is the way to riches, but it pays better than POD. It takes a lot to get seen in that area as well. \n\nMy thoughts: you have to be fantastic at marketing (or at least find your audience somewhere like on TikTok or Pinterest) and have an equally fantastic product. But then, sometimes foreign manufacturers (or even Michaels, the craft store) will see it, copy it and mass produce it for pennies on the dollar. I do better at my 9-5 (despite what Etsy coaches say) than I do in my Etsy shop.\n\nMy reliable \"side hustle\" is Fetch Rewards. It's not much, though. I probably average enough points every 3 months for a $50 gift card. The games have the most points, not the receipts. \n\nI consider my Etsy shop more like a part time job. It doesn't bring in much, there are no benefits, but I'm always on call to answer customer questions. Not what I call a side hustle. 😋\n\nGood luck!",

Obviously it fluctuates but on average I'd probably make $100-500 a week and spent maybe 10-60mins total per week (sourcing stuff, posting it and meeting people)\n\n\n\n\nMy process:\n\n\n\nUse [warehousewatcher.com](http://warehousewatcher.com) to find Amazon warehouse deals, alot of that stuff is 40% off + and is in like new condition. If you can't find a buyer you can always return it too.\n\n\nAlso if you go directly on [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) enter \"warehouse deals\" in the search field, this also lets you look through their warehouse items, however they've made it increasingly hard to see what's actually in stock without clicking on the item first.\nAnother excellent way to source product is if you're lucky enough to have online auctions with local pickup near you. You'd be surprised how cheap you can get things simply because you don't have competition.\n\n\n\n Places like maxsold.com list estate sales, auctions etc nearby Also places like canoe.com, keepa.com and camelcamelcamel.com are useful for finding lightning deals to flip as well. Just check camelcamelcamel to see how much it's worth regularly.\n\n\n\n\nRules, always meet in public, preferably somewhere you can get to within 2 mins or less. And never leave until they say they've arrived. This way you don't actually waste any time if people decide to ghost you (which will happen)\n\n\n\n\nIt just occured to me to post this after several friends and family just told me they were tossing out perfectly new stuff because it was \"taking up space\". I told them to list it on marketplace and it literally just never occurred to them that they could do that. Just in case others are in the same habit, thought I'd bring it up.",

I had way too much time, way too many tabs open, and zero idea what would actually work. I remember picking one simple niche, throwing together a small site, and writing a few pages just based on stuff I was already googling myself. no grand plan, just “if I’m confused about this, someone else probably is too.”\n\nthe mistake I made early was expecting fast results. every day I’d check traffic like it was a heartbeat monitor. nothing. weeks went by and it felt dead. instead of scrapping it, I left it alone because honestly I was tired of starting over. that turned out to be the accidental win. while I was distracted with other things, that little site slowly started getting search traffic.\n\nthe first time a commission showed up, I thought it was a reporting error. it was small, but it felt unreal because I hadn’t done anything that day. then it happened again a week later. that’s when I understood what people meant by “passive” — not no work, just work done earlier finally paying rent.\n\n**Takeaway:** 2020 taught me that most online stuff doesn’t need brilliance, it needs time. if something is useful and you don’t kill it too early, it has a chance to surprise you later.",

I’m better at doing shorts/reels as opposed to long form yt videos but I want to build up this skill.\n\nUGC: I can make good looking content and I’m happy in front of camera\n\nAppointment setting: I’ve seen a lot of hype about this, but don’t know much about it. \n\nSo, I guess what I’m asking is, which is the most lucrative? Which is the easiest to get clients? Is it feesable to make any of these into my full time gig / make a full time living from these “side” hustles? \n\n",

          "body": "Based on what you already do for work, SMMA makes the most sense to start with since you're literally already doing it. You know the work, you just need to find clients and charge properly for it.\n\nVideo editing for shorts is in high demand right now. Every business wants short form content and most can't edit themselves. Easier to get clients than long form youtube stuff too since the turnaround is faster.\n\nUGC could work but it's getting really saturated and brands are picky. Unless you have a specific niche or look they're after, it might be harder to break into than the other options.\n\nAppointment setting has hype because it's basically sales without the closing part. If you're good at talking to people and following up it pays well but it's also commission based usually so income can be unstable starting out.\n\nMost lucrative long term is probably SMMA if you can scale it. Easiest to get first clients is video editing since you can show a portfolio fast and there's tons of demand.\n\nNone of these are easy full time gigs immediately tho. You'll probably need to do your 9-5 for a while and build the side thing for 6+ months before it can replace your income. The people making full time money from these put in serious hours for months before it paid off.",

Its been a roller coaster but we cant get out of this jam. My wife works as a shopper and delivers to customers home. She makes anywhere between 800-1200 a week. Pay for this company has really decreased overtime and she works 5-6 days a week.\n\nI work for a friend who gets the ins on tax refund opportunities for small and big businesses. Section 125 cafeteria plans (not easy to sell and whoever i did sign up only brings me about $500/3 months).\n\nTip tax credit that will only pay in 6-10 weeks (its an irs refund and just takes a little bit for turn around. I have about 29 apps in with 1/4 that don't qualify. Either way, its gonna be a while).\n\nI just got my life/health/accident license in NYC and paid another grand for insurance + extra states line of authority (in the last month, passed my test 10/20). My friend got us an in with a company that does medicare but AOE(annual open enrollment is closed til jan 1st) so cant use this license yet unless i start working for some company.\n\nI signed up with a local company that does roadside for insurance companies which i try to do when im not doing tip tax phone calls and that brings in about 100-150 a day after tips if i work a few hours.\n\nI have stuff i bought for cheap to resell thats not moving nearly fast enough, barely 100/month (i also stopped buying cuz no funds).\n\nI bought a car about a year ago that I'm renting out and is bringing me $250 a month renting it out.\n\nI power wash a fleet of 13 smaller busses for $70 each once a month that I split with a partner but now in the winter it will slow down.\n\nIm not lazy, and i dont mind finding a job, but i spent so much money on my license, and have the other stuff going, that im not sure if I should do that.\n\nExpenses.... we pay $2500/month for the house (we bought together with my father in law but he put 80% down so we are paying towards the house (he also annual property taxes of about 7k+), and we have lived here for 4 years.) \n\nBetween $150-350/month on electric (we do have solar panels transferred from the previous owners that cost my FIL $80/month) \n\nBetween $120-200/month on gas/heating \n\n$40 for wifi (verizon fios 300mb) \n\n$120 for tmobile (2 lines) \n\n$1900/month for 2 kids school (non negotiable and cannot take them out) 3rd kid is free through state pre k 4. \n\nAbout $200/month paying back previous school fees, catching up \n\nAbout $100/month for memberships \n\nAbout $300/month for kids extracurricular activities \n\nWe do receive assistance for food but spend about $500-800/month for food Maybe $120 fuel/month \n\nCar insurance is 340/month through geico for 3 cars.(2019 hybrid minivan, my 09 pickup and the car im renting out.)\n\nanywhere between 6000 - 7500 monthly expenses including CC payments.\n\nWe have CC balances mounting to about 25k out of 120k available. Paying what we can I have a bachelor's in business administration and computer science from a great online school during covid.\n\n30k in student loans that I'm having defeated over and over and haven't made a payment yet.\n\nI started a roadside assistance website (clearpathprollc.com) that gets a ton of traffic but no orders yet. I just started another site through shop if to attempt dropshipping but haven't completed it yet.\n\nPlease dont troll, please dont scam. I'll take constructive criticism, tips, opportunities. Im a hustler, im known to take on way too much but I know how to juggle it. I am patient, have plenty of customer service experience, great with leadership and logistics, planning, and am very tech savvy. I did own a moving company for 7 years and closed when covid happened. I was considering starting again but not its not busy enough from what i hear..\n\nThank you, willing to answer most questions",

Many people change careers, jobs and pivot to different industries entirely in their lifetime. Keep an open mind and consider the right sidehustle could make back anything you put into that license and even more.\n\nThe other advice I’d give is try to focus on ONE thing. I know you are trying different things and that is good to a degree. But juggling too many things can actually make it harder to focus on one thing that could really make the difference.\n\nI can’t tell you whats best for your situation, but whats working for me is trying Affiliate Marketing for high ticket items.

There is no such thing as a passive job. Passive income represents money you earn while you sleep. By your logic, not even investing is true passive income because:\n1) the money still needed to be earned one way or another.\n2) someone is still out there actively managing that investment (whether it is you or a broker)\n\nSo, if someone invests upfront time and costs into a vending machine business that needs to be emptied and stocked (say once a month), the entire month that it’s not being actively stocked or emptied it is earning you passive income. I would argue that vending machines are a source of TRUE passive income since they can’t be use while being filled…\n\nThe same maintenance schedule can be applied to buying and selling stocks. Once you invest that first initial time, or any subsequent time if you buy and/or sell, it becomes active, but while it sits there, it is passive.\n\nOnce you make and upload a YouTube video, it can now bring in passive income (in theory; popularity and many other factors play a big role). Once production is done, the video needs little/no maintenance to continue to get views and have earning potential. Sure, you have to put in work to make the videos and set up ads or whatever you need to do, but each video you make and upload creates its own stream of passive income.",

Even if something still needs your involvement to really take off, if sales or revenues or whatever can theoretically come without your direct involvement, that’s technically passive income.\n\nFor example, I am an author. I recently published a middle grade / young adult superhero novel. I have it available as an ebook to buy or read on Kindle Unlimited, and the paperbacks are available via Print on Demand. I’m still at the point where I have to do a TON of marketing work for each sale as I am a brand new unknown author, but each sale occurs without my input. Someone could be purchasing my book right now and I have nothing to do with that directly. That’s passive income. I CAN make sales even when I’m not directly involved.\n\nCompare that to if I brought a couple dozen copies of my book to a book festival to sell. That would be active income. Not because it’s harder or more work, but because I am personally involved in each sale. I am personally speaking to the customer, taking their money, putting the book into a bag, etc. It’s active income because it fundamentally requires my involvement; if I were to pack my books up and leave, the sales stop. This has nothing to do with me not being well known yet. It’s just how it works.\n\nThe issue is that people hear “passive” and they watch all the finance bro passive income YouTubers shilling their crypto shitcoins, and they think that it means no work. A phrase I heard a decade ago that I always tell people is “passive income does NOT denote passive activity”. There are active income streams that involve far less work than some passive income streams. That doesn’t change the fundamental income mechanisms that make them active of passive income.\n\n\n\nBy the way, if anyone’s looking for a book to give to a tween, teen, or young adult (or any age) book or superhero lover, I can post a link to it. 🙃 See?

      "selftext": "Hey everyone not sure if you remember me but back in June I started an update series on this sub called Selling Weekly \"Lottos\". My goal was to try and show people how selling options using your shares and cash as collateral can be an amazing form of passive income.\n\n\n\n\n\nNever stopped, just moved my posts over to places with a similar community related to selling options for income. Still showing all my choices and results every week.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack when I just started it here I got a few people saying to show the longer term results.\n\n\n\n\n\nWell 6 months was last week. I made almost $40,000 using an average weekly risk of $132,000. Thats a 30% total yield.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this was a normal 40 hour a week job I would have been making $38 per hour for this last 6 months doing this. But I barely spend an hour a week opening and closing the positions.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople really misunderstand this strategy. They think you can lose everything, but out of 26 weeks I only lost 2 weeks and both were normal investing losses, nothing outlandish.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople also think it will underperform the market. Well my results show this outperforms the market. I got double the return of SPY in this time frame.\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly people think its risky, but its risk adjusted returns are the highest. Maybe people automatically assume because it has to do with options contracts so its like wsb.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll i'm doing is making an agreement with a buyer to either sell the shares much higher or buy the shares much lower by next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gambler pays a premium for this chance because they can make a lot of money in a short time if the stock really does go up or down huge.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you really look at the charts stocks mostly stay sideways for a long time then get a sudden burst where they go straight up or down for a short period of time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThats why this outperforms just buying and holding SPY in my opinion. You are getting income every week just because stocks COULD go up or down.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd its not like dividends where the money is subtracted out of your shares. Options premium income is in additional to any unrealized gains.\n\n\n\n\n\nI also get an automatic HYSA for cash being used for cash secured puts. This is a 3.65% icing on the cake called a Money Market Account in brokerages. That interest income isn't included in the results.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I'll keep seeing whats happens. We had perfect market conditions for this strategy this last 6 months, so I want to test this out in a less forgiving market.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, let me know if you have questions and I'll try to ELi5.",

You already know your favorite retailer’s patterns. Patterns are important. If you have a retirement plan then you can see how they swing trade as well. Even drug dealers buy low and sell high.\n\n2. Sales - Learn to sell times right way. Power of persuasion is a valuable tool. Works a million times better when you are actually selling to folks with good intent. \n\n3. Learn to Earn - Lets make one fact clear: money does not exist. You must work for everything special and terrible in life. That’s part of the plan. The knowledge you take in and translate that to action is a major building block in your journey.\n\nWhen you’re out shopping, make sure to comb through the clearance section of every store you go to you. What can you resell? Plan trips for thrifting and garage sales. I still do that.\n\nThe process of you putting in the time planning and executing great strategies coupled with who you meet is priceless.\n\nWhen you go to a new town on vacation or just stopping by, place yourself as a person that is planning on moving there and speak to people. Actually listen to what they say, suggest, what they do for a living, etc… Build relationships. Travel as much as you can.\n\nI can go on and on since I have done so much in my life to create “passive income”.\n\nWork hard, and do it with great intent and you will make 80% of your adventures work out.\n\nWhen you see or come up with a new idea, attack it passionately to see if it will work. Don’t quit until you are forced to pivot meaning you maxed out your returns. Don’t just quit just to quit.",

          "body": "IMO, there isn’t really a single “skill” that leads to passive income. What works is learning how to package something you’re good at and getting it in front of the right people.\n\nThat “something” can sit anywhere on a spectrum:\n\n\t•Services (tutoring, proofreading, childcare) → more active, easier to start\n\n\t•Digital products (printables, templates) → create once, sell repeatedly\n\n\t•Content/affiliates → slower burn, more scalable\n\nServices usually require more hands-on effort, but they’re a great entry point. For example, tutoring or kids’ activities are best marketed in parent spaces — PTA groups, school newsletters, community boards, libraries, coffee shops near schools, etc.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I made cootie catchers out of flyers advertising myself as a mother’s helper and handed them out at our community pool. My mom shared them through PTA connections. That’s not advanced marketing — it’s just knowing where your audience already is and when they’re mentally open to noticing your offer.\n\nPrintables sit closer to the “passive” end. You create them once (worksheets, planners, kids’ activities) and sell them repeatedly on sites like Etsy. But it’s saturated, so discovery still matters. You don’t need to be a marketing expert — just understand the basics of SEO, algorithms, and when /your/ audience is active.\n\nIf you’re product- or lifestyle-focused (beauty, fashion, fitness, home), affiliate links (Amazon, LTK, “link in bio”) are another route. Same principle, different channel.\n\nThe closest thing to passive income comes after upfront effort: build once, market intentionally, then let systems and word of mouth take over.",

Have you looked into investing in dividend stocks? That’s as passive as things get. I would also recommend looking into selling options (“covered calls” and “cash secured puts”) - they’re super easy and can make you a lot of money fairly passively, but they can require a lot of capital depending on which stocks you want to sell options against.\n\nObviously there’s also buying rental properties, which, again, can require quite a bit of capital to get going unless you do creative financing. \n\nThere’s micro-lending through platforms like Prosper.\n\nThere’s interest that you can collect from high yield savings accounts and US Treasuries. \n\nCrypto staking is another avenue, depending on which state you live in and how comfortably you are with cryptocurrency. \n\nThen on the product side you can make and sell digital products like E-books (or even physical books though Amazon and Barnes and Noble). You can also sell digital products through sites like Shopify or Etsy. You could also create and sell courses…\n\nThere are a lot of different routes you can take, just friends on your skills, knowledge, whether you want to make a product or just buy assets.\n\nI personally collect passive income through stock dividends, selling stock options, staking crypto, collecting interest from high yield savings accounts and T bills and micro-loans, and revenue from YouTube videos, sales of digital products on Shopify and Etsy, and I collect royalties from music streams (Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, etc.) and music publishing (SoundExchange and BMI).\n\nIt can be done, it just depends on what direction(s) you want to take.",

Buy a small content site with existing traffic\n\nBut don’t buy random Flippa junk. Look for:\n\n6–12 months of Google Search Console data\n\n50%+ traffic from informational keywords\n\nMonetized via affiliates or lead gen (not ads alone)\n\n\nAfter buying:\n\nUpdate top 10 posts\n\nAdd better CTAs\n\nRepurpose content to Pinterest + Reddit + Quora This alone can 2–3× revenue without new content.\n\n\n2. Build a “semi-passive” site + paid traffic for validation\n\nInstead of waiting for SEO:\n\nPick one boring but profitable niche (finance tools, SaaS, health accessories, B2B services)\n\nBuild 20 high-intent pages\n\nSpend $500–$1k testing Google or Pinterest traffic\nOnce you find pages that convert → scale or hand off.\n\n\n3.

If the spread is 19 points you want to pay no more than .35 percent that is a guide.  The part you want is for it to be in an uptrend.  Keep in mind right.

Instead try focusing on the niche that is realistic/doable.\n\nStart learning AI whether its gonna be building or generating.  AI generated digital products are becoming part of the passive income i believe - people love seeing cool creations. Product mockups, special requests etc. and you can turn it into the service that some category of people will be willing to pay. Personally for anything visuals I use Pykaso AI and its in built several models that help me to get consistent images.

      "selftext": "I work in corporate HR which is ironic because I'm the one enforcing our social media policy. Last year I had to write someone up for posting a photo of their desk on Instagram. Just their desk. So I'm definitely not showing my face anywhere.\n\nBeen trying to make productivity content work since August. Time management tips, how to organize your day, that kind of stuff. Figured it couldn't be that hard.\n\nIt was that hard.\n\nStarted with text over stock footage. Coffee cups and notebooks. Nobody watched. Maybe 400 views per video and it took forever to edit each one.\n\nTried filming my hands writing in a planner after a few weeks. One video got 1900 views and I thought I figured it out. Made a bunch more. They got like 500 each. So I didn't figure it out.\n\nKept posting through September and October. Views stayed around 500 to 700. Wasn't great but at least it was consistent.\n\nThen I bought better equipment because everyone said quality matters. Microphone for $95. Got a music subscription and some caption app. Was paying like $40 a month for tools. My videos looked way more professional.\n\nViews got worse. Dropped back down to 400, sometimes 300. I literally spent money to go backwards.\n\nMy roommate kept asking how it was going in this voice like she thought the whole thing was pointless. It probably was. I'd been doing it for months and made zero dollars.\n\nFew weeks ago I just changed everything. Made the videos look like an actual person talking instead of text floating around. Using CapCut for editing, APOB for the face part since I obviously can't use mine, and Riverside for audio. About $30 a month total so at least it's cheaper than before.\n\nViews got better. Not consistent but better. Some videos get 5000 views, some get 1800. I still have no idea why. Posted two videos about morning routines last week. Same style, same length. One got 5800 views and one got 1600. Makes zero sense.\n\nI'm at 1900 followers now. A productivity app reached out last week and paid me $100 for a sponsored video. First money I've made from this.\n\nTold my roommate and she was like oh wow you actually made money. Yeah. $100. After four months. That covers my share of groceries for two weeks.\n\nI still don't know what I'm doing. Some videos work and most don't. The algorithm feels completely random. I'm putting in maybe 5 hours a week and I can't tell if it's going anywhere.\n\nThe $100 is something but it's also basically nothing. I could've done Uber Eats on weekends and made way more without spending hours trying to figure out why one video gets 5800 views and another gets 1600.\n\nBut what if I quit now and next month I actually start making decent money. Or what if I keep going and it stays like this and I just wasted more time.\n\nI'm tired of not knowing if this is worth it or if I should just cut my losses and do something that actually pays consistently.\n\nHow long did it take you to figure out if content was actually worth sticking with?",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche.\n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1.\t⁠start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n2.\t⁠once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n3.\t⁠once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course.\n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you.\n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you!

          "body": "Maybe reselling textbooks online? Some mass book stores sell books for cheap, so cheap that it might come off sketchy to consumers. You could buy some of the cheaper books and up charge them when reselling. Like I saw a book online for $20, that cost $200 at like Walmart. As long as they are more affordable than the brand new copies, and you build a reputable reputation, people might pay more than the cheapest option if they know that they can trust the seller.\n\nYou could work with college students, because colleges tend to upcharge a crazier amount than regular stores. (Literally got my college to lower their textbook price by $200 just because a local store had it $200 cheaper.) (Make sure to take plenty of pictures of the textbooks, so the consumers know what they are getting.)",

Everyone owns 5-20 properties but nobody has any clue which ones perform well, they're all just guessing on rent prices and maintenance budgets, flying blind on which property to sell first if they need cash.\n\nConvinced 3 friends to give me read only access to their property data for a free trial. Sent them weekly reports showing underperforming units, rent optimization opportunities, maintenance spending alerts, market comparisons against similar properties in their area. All 3 offered to pay immediately after first report, didn't even finish the trial period.\n\nBuilt it into a service at $99/month. “How is this a passive income?” I use leni to automate the analysis work and get all the necessary insights fast. No manual hours per cliet, which would've also made this impossible to scale. Now at 47 subscribers which is $4,653/month. Time investment is maybe 4-5 hours weekly reviewing what gets flagged and personalizing the reports with my insights.\n\nGrowth has been 100% word of mouth through investor groups and rei [meetups.Business](http://meetups.Business) model works because investors know they're leaving money on table but don't have time or skills to analyze properly. I'm not doing anything sophisticated, just filling gap between \"I know I should track this\" and tracking it. Like one client found few thosands in missed rent increases just from first analysis, another discovered they should've sold a property 2 years ago based on performance trends.",

          "body": "If anything, learn a hard skill/career that you can practice and make money solely on. Writing, video editing, digital marketing, web development. It's best to focus on one, but you will likely find yourself having to do other things around it, which does give a good platform for later on should you wish to go down those routes. \n\nStart with those and build around it, a lot of the less tangible skills will come through your own understanding and maturity. For instance, copywriting requires the ability to research, and also doing it to create your own understanding (especially now with AI lowering the bar a bit). \n\nI started with writing articles, and that led me into copywriting. I learned how SEO worked, how to monetise blogs and websites, how to communicate with potential clients. That's just one line of work, but it's just an example of how you can branch out your skills and insight the further you go. \n\nIt's better to start slow and steady as well with these, go into it with the idea of becoming good at what you do, rather than making money. The competition is massive online, but excelling and standing out is what gives longevity from my experience. Most of my opportunities have come from people seeing the quality of my work and the results, rather than me having to hard sell to them. \n\nAlso, you should consider attitudes more than anything. Be patient, put the effort in, don't make shortcuts and become resilient. It takes time to get anywhere reasonable, and you need to temper your expectations at times, but the success cut through eventually and that's what you need to focus on.\n\nEdit: Just realised this was the passive income sub, not the one I thought it was. A lot of this still rings true, but focus on a niche you're interested in and build something around that. You can practice skills easily, you will understand the market/industry/topic better and you will have an easier time getting the ball rolling.",

Even for 1m+ followers, for a meme page you could expect to earn $15 - $50 per sponsored post until you can prove audience viability.\n\nMy advice would be to find / wait for some general sponsors, find out what does well w your audience, and then shift to promoting affiliate products that you’ll get a % commission on. That’s when you’ll actually start earning, once you find a product you know your audience will like + a business willing to play ball &amp; give you a cut of their actual earnings.",

First month I made like $50 while building reviews but now it's steadier. Takes time though, maybe 2-3 months before it feels worth it. Also Upwork now makes you buy connects to apply to jobs but if your profile is good u might get invited for the jobs so if your buildin a profile there make sure to keep it polished.\n\nRemote part time work like customer service or virtual assistant jobs. \n\nFor smaller amounts faster, survey and reward apps work but they're slow. I make around $80-100 a month from a few apps combined using stuff like Swagbucks, Branded Surveys, and Babki which has both surveys and games. It's not impressive but it covers my Spotify and food between paychecks. Takes maybe 2 weeks to see your first cashout depending on the app.\n\nAs a finance student you could also look into tutoring high school kids through Wyzant or similar sites. Pays better than surveys and you can set your own rates.\n\nThe honest answer is nothing pays quick and easy. The stuff that pays well takes months to build up. The stuff that pays immediately doesn't pay much. Pick based on whether you need money this week or you're okay with a longer ramp up for better pay later.",

Now I am living it.\nOne business is profitable but still early stage. The other is a startup that needs heavy lifting.\nBoth require marketing, ads, experiments, money going out before money comes in.\nI underestimated how competitive it is just to get attention. Meta ads, Google ads, creative testing, all of it. I really thought I could just show up and grow something. Absolutely delusional.\n\nThe hardest part?\nIgnoring the headhunters calling with mid six figure jobs.\nI know I can go back. I know I can make money tomorrow. But that is the life I spent years trying to escape.\n\nAnd then there is the identity shift.\nTelling girls I am building companies instead of being the finance guy at a big fund.\nNot casually dropping $200 on sushi like it is nothing.\nNot skiing every winter.\nNot having that easy, comfortable narrative of I am doing well.\n\nIt is humbling. Honestly, some days it is embarrassing. I did not expect it to hit this hard.\n\nBut I also have so much respect now for entrepreneurs who stuck through this phase and made it work. You do not realize how much grit it takes until you are the one staring at the ceiling at 3AM wondering if you are insane.\n\nRant over.\n\nWould love to hear if anyone else went through this identity and lifestyle whiplash when switching from a high paying job to entrepreneurship.",

Last month as I was loading up my car after a Pop Up shop - sweating and out of breath in the fall heat - I said aloud to myself, “I did not go to college for this.” \n\nYes, I make half of my old salary and watch on social media as my former colleagues travel the world on the company dime. But now, in my mid 40s, there is no way I’d go back to 24 hour emails and demanding bosses. Not for all the designer clothing and fancy restaurants in the world. \n\nMy advice is to find little ways to bring luxury back into your life. I love to cook elaborate meals eaten on fancy dinnerware. I adopted an inexpensive Steve Jobs-type uniform so I could splurge on fancy skincare and hair products. I gave up international travel so I could buy a nicer car. \n\nI finally am at peace with my lifestyle. And more importantly, I’m getting to spend quality time with my parents in the last years of their lives. Something I could not have done working 12 hours a day. \n\nHang in there, OP.",

Walking out the door the day I quit was one of the happiest days of my life, but the follow up has been tough.  Moved from central London, which I didn’t like much anyway, to a beautiful low cost city on the continent to start the business.  \n\nLong story short the business didn’t work out, but I did learn a ton and I’m better for the experience.

I think my net worth is probably 1/3 to 1/2 what would be had I kept my old job.  But the new job is actually super interesting, I can make a lot of impact and if we get the right exit I’ll make back what I lost and then some. \n\nNow, do I have regrets?  Yea.  I didn’t like London and I was sick of the job but the fact is it was easy to coast along and collect the paycheck.  It’s amazing how much these high profile IB jobs lets you just ride along on the franchise once you get to a certain level.  Life would have been easy (minus the brutal commute) if I was able to suck up the politics and work drama.

You’ve also got to determine what the exit looks like, and when to say when. Various bench marks along the way and awareness to play improv when the unseen appears.\n\nAll the feelings- negative and positive- exist in every arena. The ones specific to an entrepreneur are more potent since you, partners and your loved ones are the ones bearing it. \n\nIf I could help in anyway, I’d put yourself ahead 5 years from now. If you believe in what you’re doing- take out the money- how much do you really believe? If what you were doing paid nothing, would you still do it? If you would, that’s a sign you’re in the correct path. \n\nThe lifestyle change is only rough if you want it to be- I lived next to poverty for 4-5 years before I hit a break through.

And be young enough where you don’t have kids to have to support too. \n\nYour biggest concern is telling girls you’re building companies instead of being in finance?. Give me a break. That’s the douchiest thing I’ve ever heard. \n\nBe humble. Build your product. Shut the fuck up and get your head in the right place. Ownership and being a founder is not easy. Learn from your mistakes and be thankful you can pay your bills while your company(s) grow and while mistakes are made. \n\nI’m 44. Built and shipped 9 apps, partner in a vintage retail store, and wrote a self help book for people with terminal illness. I worked for someone else for 3 years total in my life. Business ownership isn’t easy nor is it for everyone. Good for you for trying.  The reality of entrepreneurship, not everyone succeeds. Not everyone exits for 100M\n\nTake a year or two and work the business. If it fails, it fails. My advice, keep your day job, stay humble and work the business untill it can replace your salary. Or just be happy making 300K at 30 years old.",

I enjoy working with my hands and physically feel tired rather than being a mind zombie at night.\n\nWhen I was working in finance, the research, the deals were fun but I was lacking satisfaction that you get when you actually accomplish something and see the results. Every so often I would sit in front  of the screens and think to myself what would be if I had my own company..\n\nOne day I was at the office and said fuck it, gave my two weeks, and left. After that went to school to get the licenses it took 9 months. Once the company started operating it was just go go go, spend money to earn money. I can’t say I was expecting it to be easy, but the construction business is kind of bad (for me) and I’m realizing it now.\n\nI am an honest person and pretty fair and ethical. I have my prices and pay subtrades  early and full amounts, don’t hassle with them, I want them to win. All that for its to only bite me in the ass after. Work is badly done, and I have to swallow the problem. \n\nI deal with businesses, and the delays are 30-45 days on paper, but in reality it’s 60-90-120 days. What really sucks is that I’m essentially financing projects out of pocket, to then wait and suck up for stuff that wasn’t part of the deal so I please the clients to not only get my money back, but to get paid.\n\nAnyway the image change and ego is what I think stops me from going all in. Going from fancy offices, travelling, spending thousands at restaurants to now always surviving. I essentially have one foot in this new career and the other still in finance, every so often I think of going back. To this day I haven’t updated my LinkedIn since leaving finance because there’s something I feel embarrassed about. \n\nThe entrepreneurial life is hard, depending of your resources and how you approach it. I had to bootstrap it, and doing much more work in different fields now. The testing part is hard, the client acquisition is hard, managing people especially hard headed construction guys is hard, bitchy and demanding clients. Everything about entrepreneurship is hard, I thought construction was in such demand, yeah maybe it is if you’re building new neighborhoods or government contracts, but you have to get to that point, and that’s the hardest part.\n\nI feel ya!",

      "selftext": "After 5 years of starting and growing a cleaning business, I recently just signed the dotted line to sell it! I have officially exited my first business!\n\nFunny to think I stumbled across a Reddit post about starting a cleaning business and did everything that it said lol. Shout out Rohan and anyone who got started from that thread.\n\nIt only felt right to make this post on Reddit because this is where it all started.\n\nThis post isn’t a “how to start a cleaning business” or anything, just sharing a few things from my journey. If you have questions you can ask away!\n\nWhen I started, it was at the beginning of the “remote cleaning business” model era. It took me time to get the business started because I was in college. Once I cracked marketing, which was right before I graduated back in 2021, things began to roll.\n\nApril 2021 I had my first 10-cleaning month. June I had my first 20-cleaning month and July we went up to 30 cleanings. I was all in on the business since then. It was my full-time job, but it was more like a full-time masterclass on business, MBA and the gulag you go through as an entrepreneur. I’m 26 years old now and since starting the business I’ve grown so much when I sit back and reflect. I’m no guru either! I’m from Detroit, I moved to Atlanta to go to Morehouse College, I started my cleaning business my senior year, and since graduating I’ve spent my life up to this point of writing this running the business. \n\nAt the height of the business, which is when I decided it was time to sell, I had the business operating on a chaotic rope.\n\nI had residential cleaning customers and commercial contracts . At one point we had a number of Airbnb properties we did cleaning for and at another point operated all three at the same time. (Was a freaking zoo!) I had a great office manager named V who was the sweetheart and pitbull for me and the business. I had a great team &amp; rolodex of cleaners who, after all the mayhem, worked with us for multiple years at a time. When it was time to ascend, we eventually got another star named J who was our sales rep alongside me.\n\nThe business was at a point where a majority of the business was operating on a system and I checked on everything from my phone.\n\nThis is the point where I decided to package up and get the business on the market for my own personal reasons.\n\nIt’s so much that I learned from running a cleaning business, but these things are the most important that im about to share. \n\n**Live and die by your cleaners.**\n\nIt took me years to understand why the cleaners are the most important part of the business. When I started I thought you could just hire a cleaner by the snap of a finger and when I did that I almost lost every time. The cleaners are the backbone of the business. They are the make or break point. It’s necessary to appreciate when you come across great cleaners and keep them busy. Understand that when customers hire a cleaning service that’s a very serious buying decision for them. Imagine a customer books you, you send an unqualified cleaner and the customer is unhappy and never books with you again. That’s what happened with me until I started bringing on good talent.\n\nMany will say the most important aspects of the cleaning business are marketing and you need to focus on growing, but the hidden marketing lever is having some Vini’s and Itsmenia’s on your team. That’s what I had. I had cleaners that people knew and loved. When you have that you can almost hit a money glitch. Literally your business can grow through word of mouth the proper way. The cleaners were most important. It’s a grind at first but once you find that space cherish and respect it.\n\n**The power of niching is a great power!**\n\nWhen I first started the business I used Thumbtack, I used Yelp, I passed out flyers, I DID EVERYTHING! It all brought in clients. We did whatever because I was hungry and I needed to pay the bills. I didn’t have any other job, I did the cleaning business full time, so if you called we were going to clean it. It took me until about year 2 to understand the power of niching.\n\nWhen I finally understood, it’s like we hit another money glitch. Business got a little easier and we gained more money that made complete sense! I figured out which customer we were going to serve. We had services tailored only to their problems and aligned our systems towards solutions for only the problems they had. When I did this people found us vs us looking for them. When things got slow of course we always got back out there and took whatever that made sense, but we stayed true to the niche we chose and that’s when I started benefiting and growing the biz.\n\n**It will behoove you to become a local superstar!**\n\nIf you run any type of business and you get customers that are paying you cold hard cash and using your services or whatever you sell, pat yourself on the back! Because people online make it like getting customers in your business is easy the shit is not easy! It’s only when you finally crack it is when it becomes easy like playing a video game.\n\nWhat I realized is that you have to become a local superstar and get your business out there as much as possible. You need to shout and let everybody know what you got going on. IDC who it is because when you do, eventually you will become known for what you are doing. That’s what happened with me. I let everybody and their mother know about my cleaning business. Not only that, I invested heavily into my marketing skills.\n\nHere are the areas I can turn on with a push of a button (Facebook Ads, Google Ads and SEO, and Thumbtack and please don’t put me in a room full of people because I will get business from an event too). I will go over this in a moment. But becoming a local superstar and known for what you do is a compounding effort. If you take your business serious the support you get is the gift you receive from being undeniable. I lasted 5 years, you will be surprised how many people don’t even start. People will recognize you! People will need you and soon people will start calling you. It’s up to you to step to the plate and perform.\n\n**You need flow.**\n\nWhenever I expressed hardship in my business, my friend who runs a million dollar + landscaping business would always say fill up your pipeline. A pipeline in business does solve problems and should not be approached lightly. I will say you need to approach this as if someone is trying to take literal food from your loved one’s mouth. As if it’s life or death because truly if you aren’t getting customers you will eventually go flat. This means you need customers coming in from multiple areas.\n\nWhat I did was have paid ads and organic flows. For each area I put a system in place. I learned and put time into each area and it wasn’t all at the same time either. It started with the platforms like thumbtack, then I got decent with organic social media, decent with paid ads (FB &amp; Google Ads), then I met the Yoda of Online Marketing, SEO. I wasn’t good at the beginning but over time I got good at each stop, built a system around it and kept it going. I’m not saying go and do all of this because it’s time consuming.\n\nWhat I am saying is that each system that got built all went into either the residential pipeline or commercial pipeline. My main goal was to get new people in the doors that I can talk to. I kept my pipeline full! \n\nA glitch is letting people know about your cleaning business on stage at local events. I constantly went to business events around ATL and every chance I got I grabbed the microphone and introduced my business with everyone looking. At these events people have bumrushed me for my information, to the point where I had my iPad ready to collect info and sell on spot. Take that information and do with it what you will.\n\nThen I began to get the soulful nod that it was time for me to depart from the cleaning business. It was such a journey. I once read in a book that once you finally get your business to the point where it’s running without you and things change, you can become more motivated to continue to grow that business. Not me. I’m forever grateful to the cleaning industry and have no ill will towards it, but I was able to see that it was time to go elsewhere.\n\nThe journey led me to the stop to sell my business and on Nov 3rd, after months of work to sell the business, a contract was signed! At that moment the relief I felt was so reassuring that I hit a money dance! \n\nI’m so happy to have been in the industry and started my business journey here!\n\nFor all the cleaning business owners and aspiring, keep pushing! This is an industry that is in demand. A cleaning business is a business that can provide you with whatever you need during the time of your life. Need extra money? Pick up a few houses to clean. Want to build a multi million dollar cleaning business? You can literally sign a few contracts and be at a million with a cleaning business. It’s whatever you want it to be. Not saying it’ll be easy but the money is there!\n\n\n\nI wish you all luck! And if you read this far, thank you!",

No internet, no computers, no software, no google, just the good old yellow pages and a local newspaper. I worked (cleaning) in the business early on (I really enjoyed cleaning) I’ve seen a lot of cleaning companies come and go over 40 years.

Today there are plenty of scheduling software’s available. Zenmaid, Jobber, just to name a few \nThere are also a few cleaning gurus out there that can help you grow your business \nDebbie Sardone has a great program , Cleaning Business Fundamentals (CBF)\nAnd yes, the key to every business is great employees, in our cleaning business, our employees stay an average of 8 years (I believe 5 years is the industry standard)\nToday, I work in the office with another person, we have someone who does our marketing, and 14-16 employees. \nThe best of luck to everyone.",

I think a lot of people start businesses not because they “love people,” but because they hate bad incentives, bad managers, and pointless friction.\n\nWhat usually changes is *who* you’re dealing with. When it’s your own thing, the customers you keep are the ones you actually like working with, and you can design the work to minimize the interactions you hate. That alone makes it feel way lighter, even if the money isn’t crazy.\n\nThe downside is you end up wearing every hat, which can get exhausting in a different way. A lot of solo founders I know are fine with customers, but get burned out by the admin, follow-ups, and keeping everything straight.\n\nThat’s basically why we’re building Quorum (still beta).

At the beginning there’s momentum, ideas flying around, telling friends what you’re building. Then at some point it’s just you, your laptop and a long stretch of decisions no one else can really help you with.\n\nWhat surprised me is that the hard part isn’t motivation, it’s uncertainty. There’s no clear signal that you’re doing the right thing, just small indicators that might mean progress or might mean nothing. Some days you feel smart and capable, other days you wonder if you’re just confidently wrong. This really hit me recently when I was reviewing my numbers and remembered I have some money saved up that gives me a bit of runway. Instead of feeling relieved, I felt the weight of responsibility. Every decision suddenly feels louder when it’s your own money, your own time, and no safety net telling you what to do next.\n\nI’m still committed, still building still learning but I didn’t expect the mental side to be this isolating. Curious how others deal with that quiet phase where you’re not failing, not winning, just grinding alone.",

For years, the world thought they were dead. WWI happened and these guys had no idea. Stuck on the bottom of the Earth. \n\nThe Captain, Ernest Shackleton, was keeping them alive. Against every odd and setback possible, this guy's determination and ability to endure is what kept the entire crew alive. Not one guy died.  Towards the end of the story, after years of being lost at sea, you cannot comprehend how Shackleton found it in himself to remain optimistic and get the job done. \n\nReally dramatic answer but the point is you have to endure. It sucks. It takes forever. Its lonely. But like, we aren't lost at sea and hunting penguins and sleeping on ice. If we want something, we can do it. It might be painful and take way too long -- but Shackleton traversed glaciers on foot, alone, while starving to death, to save his men. You can build a company.",

I dreamed about it when I was an employee: to be my own employer, decide what to do, when and why.

Also, I have users that want this and that, which makes me feel less isolated.\n\nI'm talking about myself and you and many others are different and may feel really isolated. I may suggest you to  launch as soon as possible (even with a landing page before the real product launch), talk about your idea/product/website/whatever everywhere, get feedback as soon as possible - soon you will find people need your product/features and your isolation is gone. If not, and after publishing and talking you still feel isolated and lonely - maybe you picked up a wrong idea and people don't want to talk about it, to talk to you about it, discuss it, or suggest something to be implemented.\n\nAnyway, this stage is always presented but it 100% up to you to make it as short as possible.\n\nYeah, and one more hack: set up publicly or privately available metric page: users amount, or query or what else that show you: people use your product therefore they need you.

      "selftext": "I never thought that a decision made by Trump on the other side of the world could almost shut down my business. The story went like this. On August 19, we received an email from Omniva (Estonian Post): \"Starting tomorrow, we no longer ship parcels to the USA. Please find other delivery methods.\" August 20 is a public holiday in Estonia. The US accounts for about 60% of our wall decals shipments. We started looking for a solution urgently. We asked Omniva when it would be fixed. The answer: maybe 2-3 weeks, maybe 2-3 months. Meanwhile, sticker orders from America kept coming in.\n\nWe found a solution, though it wasn't pleasant. We decided not to turn off the US on marketplaces. On Amazon, Etsy, and eBay, everything depends on your rating. The more you sell, the higher you are in search results. Losing positions we built for years in one day would be a catastrophe. So, everything that used to go via Omniva, we started sending via FedEx. This is 3 times more expensive.\n\nA week later, the second blow came. All parcels generated before the 20th but handed over to Omniva afterward were returned. That was 70 packages. We finished September with a serious loss. Simply because delivery ate up everything. But we started to adapt.\n\nIt turned out that small stickers could be sent to the US in envelopes with a stamp they went through. This lowered costs slightly. In October, we managed to raise prices by about $5, fortunately, competitors did the same. The month ended with a small loss, but better than September.\n\nI want to clarify one thing: this was not the fault of the Estonian post (Omniva). Their systems were ready. The problem was on the US side, specifically with USPS, which was not technically ready to accept parcels, declare them, and process the data under the new regulations. It was a glitch in America, not Estonia.\n\nEvery week we were on calls with Omniva, waiting for news. And only in early November, after almost two months, Omniva finally reopened shipping to the US for business clients. We can exhale, but the price has gone up by about 1.5 times. Now, at least, it is clear what prices to set on marketplaces to work in the black again.\n\nMy conclusions:\n\nOn one hand, this political decision almost closed my business. On the other hand, thanks to this, we found new solutions, rebuilt our logic, and realized that as a team, we are ready for any surprises. A legitimate bonus: during this time, I made a great contact at UPS. They offered conditions better than FedEx in terms of both price and speed. We are already at the final stage of signing the contract.\n\nAlso, to minimize losses, we worked according to a \"silent\" algorithm: If an order came from the US, we packed it and put it on hold for 10 days. If Omniva didn't solve the issue in 10 days, we sent it via FedEx. If they did we sent it through them. Since the client has a standard delivery time of about two weeks, everything arrived on time.\n\nThat is the story.",

Much of the “market data” is behind paywalls because it’s designed for large companies, not for individuals trying to validate an idea. It often feels like others have a map while you’re guessing in the dark.\n\nMost founders deal with this by piecing together imperfect but real signals instead of seeking perfect data. Customer interviews, competitor pricing pages, reviews on sites like Reddit, G2, and Amazon, job listings, forums, and even sales calls can provide much more insight than polished reports. Scraping public information, running small paid tests, or talking directly to suppliers can offer surprisingly accurate insights at a low cost.\n\nIn practice, early businesses succeed not by having perfect data but by learning faster than their assumptions fail. The system favors larger players, but resourceful workflows, genuine conversations, and quick experiments often outperform expensive reports at this stage.",

Just share tools or services you personally use or genuinely like. A lot of people on TikTok and YouTube are earning steady income this way, and once you understand how to place your links, it’s one of the lowest-effort income streams out there.\n\n2. Consulting.\nMost folks don’t realize how much their experience is actually worth. If you’ve spent years in any field : business, tech, creative work, ministry, fitness, whatever someone else is trying to learn what you already know. Offering simple consulting sessions can bring in quick income with very little setup.\n\n3. Digital courses.\nIf you can teach something step-by-step, you can create a small course. It doesn’t need to be complicated or long; it just needs to help someone solve a problem or get a result. Once it’s made, it can continue to generate revenue without you constantly working on it.\n\nAll three are beginner-friendly, affordable to start, and can be launched in a few weeks or less.",

If you are actually serious about anything you're doing, which it seems like you are, you will avoid using AI for anything proprietary like the plague. If you use AI ***you will not be able to trademark your own logo***. You may not even be protected under common IP or copyright laws, though I'm unsure (but pretty sure). Do what some of the other comments are saying and go through 99designs or Upwork. Fiverr might be good too, however you might have to comb through for longer. Make sure that whoever you go through is going through all the proper avenues to ensure you own the design once it's created.

I'd like to suggest that what you need might be a brand kit, and not just a logo. That's a pretty common service designers provide and is much more useful than just a logo. Make sure that you receive the source file for the logo. That is often an Adobe Illustrator .ai file. The source file allows you to repurpose and create versions of the logo in the future without being dependant on the original designer for any changes. Some designers make have a practice of retaining the source file, but I don't agree with that. On Fiverr some designers don't include the source file with their basic level plan. Look out for that.",

Someone who's only done tech startups might not nail the food/bev vibe. A few things to think about:\n\nTry to find someone to work with long term. They'll learn your brand and you won't have to re-explain your business every time you need a new asset. Make sure they're creating original work, not using templates. Budget platforms can be risky for this since you might run into licensing issues down the road.\n\nAsk if they provide vector files. You'll need those for scalability and most printers prefer vector-based artwork. Also worth asking if they'll create a black and white version of your logo for single color uses (like printing on kraft paper boxes, because this is very on brand for charcuterie).",

          "body": "The challenge with platforms like 99designs and Upwork is that you're often competing with hundreds of other buyers, and it can be tough to find someone who really gets your vision. What I've noticed is that the best logo designers are usually the ones who ask you loads of questions about your brand first - not just jump straight into design concepts.\n\nFor a charcuterie business specifically, you'll want someone who understands food branding and can create something that works across different materials - from business cards to packaging to maybe even embossed cheese boards down the line. I'd actually suggest looking at designers who've worked with food brands before, even if they cost a bit more upfront. The brief you give them matters loads too.. spend time thinking about whether you want something rustic and artisanal or more modern and clean, because that'll help filter out designers who aren't the right fit.",

I've seen so many logo projects go sideways because the brief was basically \"make something that looks good\" which is completely useless for any designer. When you have clear visual references and can articulate what you like about each one, you're already 80% of the way to getting something decent back.\n\nOne thing I'd add though is don't just focus on the platforms but really vet the designer's portfolio for logos specifically. Loads of brilliant illustrators or web designers are terrible at logo work because it's such a different skillset. Look for someone who's done logos in your industry or at least understands the constraints you're working with. Also worth mentioning upfront if you need file formats for print, web, merchandise etc because that can save you headaches later when you realise you only got a low res PNG.",

The trademark issues alone should make anyone think twice, and honestly most AI logos end up looking pretty generic anyway. The platforms you mentioned are solid choices, though I'd add that the key isn't just where you hire but how you vet the designers.\n\nWhen we were looking for branding work early on, I learned that checking a designer's portfolio for originality is crucial - you want to see diverse styles that don't all look the same. Also worth asking upfront about file formats and usage rights, because some designers on cheaper platforms will try to retain partial ownership or charge extra for vector files later. Budget wise, yeah a few hundred minimum is realistic for something decent, though you can sometimes find good emerging talent for less if you're willing to take a bit more risk on someone building their portfolio.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I want to share my story.\n\nI’m a freelancer working mainly in motion graphics. I move from contract to contract, making videos for different companies. Since the pandemic, getting work at design agencies has become harder for me because they want extremely high-level experts. I’m good at what I do, but I’m not the best, so I focus more on working with local businesses in my city and trying to slowly scale my business.\n\nThis season was both the best and the worst. I had a lot of work, so I hired another freelancer to help me. The problem was that she kept making excuses for late deliveries. For the video editing work I hired her for, she ended up doing almost nothing, and what she did deliver was poorly done.\n\nI tried to help her by creating SOPs and putting in a lot of effort to make things work, but it didn’t. In the end, I had to redo everything myself for a client who was already upset, and I ended up losing that client. Because of all that rework, I fell behind with other clients, which caused some of them to hold my payments.\n\nRight now, I don’t have money. I let the freelancer go, but I couldn’t cover her last invoice, and now she’s threatening to sue me.\n\nI’m really sad. I know I’m not a big company, but things got out of hand, and I feel cornered from all sides.\n\nHas anyone else been through something like this?",

I never started my own ISP but I spent over a decade working at small independent ones around the Midwest and really understanding computer networking, tech support and all kinds of Telecom, jargon and work. I was able to make a decent living with that and build a lot of skills and networks both technical and social. \n\nI lived at home till I was 25. Then I rented a place for 2 years. Then I bought my own duplex where I live in one unit and I rent the other one out. I had that paid off in about 5 years with a 15-year mortgage rents. Just went up enough and I knew I'd always want to have a roof over my head. \n\nI worked on my tech consulting business. I kind of had a really minimal one for years. You can say I technically started when I was in high school cuz I started making money then but it was really sporadic. Maybe work every month or every other super tighty. I just kind of kept it small and sporadic but it grew organically over time but I didn't put a lot of money into this. I just would have stuff get reinvested I would buy like a tool kit from money that I had business cards, a domain name, a basic one-page website and then over time I got a larger ecommerce website but really the ecom website and the LLC and a lot of the bigger stuff. Even getting business insurance was post covid and a lot of that happened in 2022 and 2023. It was a long slow bird and I ended up refining into senior citizen tech support both in person and remote as well as senior centers and teaching classes. There teaching classes at the community college that I went to. I teach continuing Ed classes there now on computers and technology. So I just kept growing and going but this was always a side hustle. I had ideas on what I wanted to do when I was younger and luckily they were built on a sound foundation and I was able to explore them grow and turn dreams into reality. Hopefully you'll be able to do that too. I still have a day job but my plan is to have a fully self-supporting self-employed tech Business and the rental income and then I should be set financially.

Get that one or two businesses that will use it and let them help you improve on it with their feedback. You need to achieve something that Eric Ries calls validated learning in his book, The Lean Startup. What that is simply is crucial info that helps you understand your customer needs better and improve the product or pivot the business.\n\nWith this approach, you won't just be trying out different businesses hoping something works out. Instead, you will be building something that eventually helps someone or a business and that way you can create a sustainable revenue source and overall an entrepreneurial journey worth journeying long-term.\n\nIf your time allows, I suggest you read that book by Eric Ries (The Lean Startup) and supplement it with The New Business Road Test by John Mullins. Same way heroes in films can inspire action so can reading about successful entrepreneurs who lay it all about their beginnings and how they built their business.",

Look at your own progression: dropshipping, pressure washing, software that solves real problems. That's not random thrashing, that's figuring shit out.\n\nThe issue isn't that you can't get things right. It's that you're building things that solve problems people have, just not problems they'll pay to solve. That's actually the last filter before product-market fit.\n\nHere's what I'd do if I were you, this is from experience:\n\nStop trying to \"come up with ideas\" for a month. relax that mental muscle. Instead, just notice what pisses you off at your day job. What manual task do you constantly do that feels stupid? What problems keeps happening? What report takes 2 hours that should take 5 minutes?\n\nBuild tools for yourself first. Use them for a few weeks. If they actually save you time, show your coworkers. If they start asking for it, you might have something.\n\nThe best businesses come from scratching your own itch, not scanning the market for opportunities (again experience). You've already proven you can build and learn - you just need to solve a problem you personally feel every week.\n\n Taking a break to recharge isn't quitting. It's smart. You can give 100% to your day job and keep your eyes open for real problems without forcing yourself to grind on side projects out of obligation. Sometimes the best ideas show up when you stop looking so hard. \n\n The universe tends to push away the things we feel we desperatly desire. Relationships, money, opportunities and the more we stress over them the furthur away they get creating a cycle. You can get off the track at anytime. Take a breth and regroup. What worked, what have I learned?  Even if its what NOT to do.  Everything is a step forward ESPECIALLY failure.  There is not 1 person who tried something for the first time and succeeded.  Every successful personhad to deal with failure of somekind.  The difference between the successful and the \"failure\" is the failure fails to push on.\n\n I'm working on it and with AI, anything is possible at the moment. Rest, regroup and move forward my entrepreneurial brother",

          "body": "Late 20s is honestly very early to be drawing conclusions about calling it quits, even though it doesn’t feel like it when you’re tired and fed up. What you’re describing doesn’t sound like someone who’s failed repeatedly, it sounds like someone who’s been searching without a stable base underneath them yet.\n\nOne thing I’d gently challenge is the idea that every attempt has to be the thing. Most people who eventually make it didn’t bounce from idea to idea until one magically worked, they anchored themselves in something boring and reliable first. A job, a trade, a skill, an industry. Then they built from inside that, not from the outside looking in. Random businesses are hard because you’re fighting on every front at once.\n\nThe pressure washer example is a good one. It didn’t fail because pressure washing is a bad business, it failed because you had no leverage yet: no experience, no reputation, no repeat customers, no pricing confidence. That’s not a character flaw, that’s just physics. The same applies to software. Solving a problem people won’t pay for usually means the problem is real, but the buyer, urgency, or positioning is wrong, not that you’re incapable.\n\nAlso, exhaustion is a signal, not a verdict. When you’re burnt out, your brain tells you stories like “I’m running out of time” and “I’m wired wrong”. Neither of those are facts. They’re what happens when effort hasn’t compounded yet. Compounding always looks stupid and pointless right up until it suddenly doesn’t.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with going all-in on a day job for a while if it buys you energy, skills, and financial breathing room. That isn’t quitting entrepreneurship, it’s regrouping. Some of the most dangerous advice out there is never give up without acknowledging that timing, positioning, and season of life matter.\n\nIf you are wired differently, that doesn’t mean you’re broken. It usually means you’re better suited to building something slowly, from depth, not chasing opportunities from the surface. Find one domain, one skill, one problem space you can sit in long enough to actually understand. Let boredom work in your favour.\n\nYou don’t need a big idea right now. You need rest, stability, and one small win that proves to you that effort can turn into results. From there, ideas show up on their own.",

Hell, I left university and tried all kinds of business ideas, sales careers, online businesses, you name it, I tried it. And I didn’t half-ass it either, I went all in, 16 to 18 hours a day. I pushed myself so far that I ended up sitting in front of a psychologist, lost, burned out, depressed and stressed.\n\nEventually, I gave myself a break and got a normal job. Just for some time, I told myself, to breathe a little, maybe plan my next big idea, recharge and collect some energy.\n\nIt’s been two years since that decision and holy shit, am I happy.\n\nI deleted all that fake influencer social media crap and actually started living. Spending time with friends and family, got a girlfriend, and that “I’ll just take a break” turned into “fuck, why didn’t I do this sooner?”\n\nI feel so much peace, love and genuine happiness.\n\nWill I ever start a new business? I can’t say, you never know. But right now, I don’t even think about it. I’ll definitely sign up for university again and get a solid degree in a field I actually love.\n\nThe problem is that I, and most young wannabe entrepreneurs, want to start a business mainly because they love the idea of having money. And that’s where it ends before it even begins.\n\nThe second hard truth, not everyone is meant to be a successful entrepreneur, and that’s completely okay. You can still make great money with a normal job, have free time and travel the world, especially now, with remote work becoming more and more common.\n\nSo my advice is simple, take a break. Breathe. Spend time with people you love. Find a hobby or two. Chill the fuck out.\n\nYou have time.\n\nAnd if later you decide you want to start a business, do it then. Plenty of people started at 50, 60 or even later.\n\nMost importantly, sit down and ask yourself why you even want to be an entrepreneur. You’ll get more answers than you can imagine, and a much clearer path forward.\n\nWishing you all the best and peaceful holidays, brother ❤️",

Ideally you should be the first result on Google when the customer searches this name on Google!\n\nThe other one that just looking at Google search console and identifying keywords you are already ranking in the top 20 but not top 3! These are usually low hanging fruits you can easily get to a higher position by publishing the right kind of blogs/content around this on your website and updating existing posts!

Everything is moving incredibly slow.   I make great money but also blow a TON personally so lifestyle creep is real.   \n\nThe thing is I need someone to manage them and I need someone to sell and someone to market and someone to do the work and office/operations.

The hardest transition I ever made was going from doing everything myself to trusting other people to handle pieces of my business. And I still struggle with it after 40+ years.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you - that employee who needs constant direction? That's actually pretty normal. Most people aren't entrepreneurs, they're executors. They need clear tasks, deadlines, and someone checking in. I learned this the hard way when I was scaling my consulting firm. I kept hiring smart people and expecting them to just \"figure it out\" like I would. Spoiler alert: they won't. What worked for me was creating super detailed SOPs for literally everything. Like stupidly detailed. \"Step 1: Open email. Step 2: Look for emails marked urgent.\" That level of detail. It felt ridiculous at first but it freed up so much of my time once people could actually follow the processes without me.\n\nThe other thing - and this might sound counterintuitive - but sometimes hiring part-time specialists works better than trying to find that unicorn who can do sales AND marketing AND operations. When I was running Digital Guard Force, I had this vision of finding these amazing generalists who could wear multiple hats. Total waste of time and money. Instead, I started bringing in contractors for specific functions. 10 hours a week of a killer salesperson beats 40 hours of someone who sort of knows sales. Plus you're not paying benefits and you can scale up or down as needed. The trick is finding someone who can coordinate all these part-timers - that's where a good operations person becomes worth their weight in gold. But again, you gotta train them first on YOUR specific way of doing things.",

They clock out, mentally disconnect, and only deal with problems again when the next shift starts. That’s not even laziness, it’s how most people are.\n\nSo the core issue might not be “finding smarter employees”, but building the right structure around the role.\n\nWhat you likely need is built in processes: clarity on what the job actually is, what the recurring tasks are, what “good” looks like, and how you want things done in your business. You mentioned the job constantly brings new problems, which makes processes harder to create. But that’s exactly why you need them. The process shouldn’t only be a checklist for predictable tasks; it should include a framework for how to handle unpredictable problems.\n\nIn other words, teach them how to think like you do when something new pops up:\n\n* how to diagnose the issue\n* what to check first\n* what questions to ask\n* what “good enough” looks like vs when to escalate\n* how to decide between options\n* how to document the solution so it’s easier next time\n\nThat framework lets them solve new issues without needing you for every decision.\n\nAlso, education is overrated for this specific problem. Education usually provides foundational knowledge and basic competence. It helps people understand the subject. But a job still requires guidance on how to execute tasks in *your* company, in *your* way, with *your* standards. Most people still need that direction, even if they’re qualified on paper.\n\nTL;DR: Education = basic understanding. Real performance = guidance + systems + feedback loops.\n\nSo I’d boil it down to two requirements:\n\n1. **Frameworks/processes** that cover both routine work and “new problem” situations.\n2. **A manager/team lead** (or someone acting as one), even with just 2 employees, if you can’t be available daily. Someone has to do the coaching, the prioritizing, and the decision support.\n\nBecause people who can consistently operate with zero guidance and drive outcomes the way an entrepreneur does are usually the people who end up building their own thing, not staying an employee.",

I went through something similar when I was scaling - had the revenue, had the vision, but kept hiring people into chaos and then wondering why they couldn't read my mind.\n\n\n\nThe real issue isn't that you need someone who can do marketing AND sales AND operations. It's that you don't have documented processes for any of those things yet. When you say your employee \"doesn't work unless you keep handing him things to do\" - that's actually normal. He has no playbook, no clear outcomes to hit, no way to know if he's succeeding.\n\n\n\nI had to learn this the hard way: you can't delegate what you haven't systematized first. Before I hired anyone else, I spent about 2 months just documenting every single thing I did. Not perfectly, just good enough. Every client interaction, every process, every decision point. Then I hired ONE person to execute ONE of those documented systems, not three people to figure out three undefined roles.\n\n\n\nStart with operations since that's foundational to everything else. Get that person to document and optimize what already works before you add complexity. Once that's running smooth, then layer in the next role. Trying to build sales, marketing, and operations simultaneously while also scaling is why everything feels slow and broken.\n\n\n\nThe money you're spending on that employee right now? Invest it in getting your existing processes crystal clear first. Then hiring becomes way easier because you know exactly what you need.\n\n  \nI'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.",

Start there before piling on more hires. Invoicing via Stripe + Make or Zapier auto-payments and reminders. Task tracking in ClickUp or Asana with automations that assign based on form submissions or email triggers, notify you only on stalls. Follow-ups chained to CRM entries. These run without anyone babysitting, giving your ops person clear rails to follow instead of chaos.\n\nCuts oversight from daily to weekly check-ins.

Second startup I forced myself to talk to 30+ people before writing any code, asked if they'd actually pay for it, got commitments, then built the simplest possible version. Sold that one for $180K. The lesson isn't \"customer discovery is magic\" because it's not, I still made tons of mistakes.

          "body": "I think you’re already ahead of a lot of people just by questioning it. The online “hustle” culture massively oversells the upside and barely mentions the trade-offs. Running a business can be brilliant, but it’s not freedom by default especially at the start. You usually swap one boss for many, income is inconsistent, the stress follows you home, and when something breaks it’s on you. There are long stretches where you’re working harder than you ever would in a job and wondering why you didn’t just take a stable salary.\n\nThat said, if you genuinely enjoy problem-solving, responsibility, and building something over time, it can be deeply satisfying in a way employment often isn’t. The real win isn’t “easy money” or flashy success, it’s autonomy, learning at speed, and eventually designing a life that suits you but that only comes after years of uncertainty and mistakes. Starting a podcast to learn and talk to owners is actually a smart, low-risk way to see the reality up close. If you go in with eyes open and accept that it’s hard, boring, stressful *and* rewarding, you’re much more likely to do well than someone chasing the Instagram version of entrepreneurship.",

Hard to turn down, shows confidence, and if you’re uniquely good, usually leads to business. My first service business picked up a lot of work this way. Our social media person did the same thing to me and has been with us for 6 years now. And a consultant i am currently working with blew my mind with the amount of time he spent over multiple sessions at no charge to me.

None of them were from cold emails or fancy marketing. The key thing I learned is you can't just post once on social media and wait. You have to actively remind people you exist and what you do. I probably sounded like a broken record for the first few months but it worked.

Their argument was  that they’ve been with the company for several years and deserve additional recognition. Honestly, I agreed and approved an increase.\n\nBut since then I can’t shake the feeling that I am overpaying for roles that could be filled by junior hires since at the end of the day its administrative work with well documented processes. i calculated roughly a 35% above average pay. I am aware onboarding someone new would be take time, but I consider it fairly quick. \n\nSo I’m torn betwee**n loyalty** for the people that adapted through changes, and helped build stability. Letting someone go purely to optimize cost feels cold\n\n**but also a**s a manager, I have a fiduciary duty to maximize efficiency and resource allocation. If a position can be performed equally well at significantly lower cost, isn’t failing to optimize also a form of negligence? Competition is closing in and margins are getting thiner. i can't exaclty throw away money.  we are by many means a frugal company. \n\nI’m genuinely conflicted about how to weigh this. How do experienced managers make these decisions? How do you evaluate when loyalty should matter and when it becomes an emotional bias that harms the business?",

First of all is what the employee is bringing to the table and what is their value add.\n\nYou mentioned this is junior administrative work. Then it seems like the employee's contribution is not that high.\n\nThe second thing to keep in mind is stability. As you noted, turnover costs a company. It takes time to onboard and ramp up a new employee. Sometimes as much as 4-6 months depending on the role.\n\nDuring those 4-6 months, you might get 50% output.  If the role is turning over every 2 years. It means that you could be losing 12.5% output a year in turnover.\n\nAddressing issue like turnover can be done through better workplace morale. A better coffee machine, even a fresh coat of paint, better decor, better chairs, desks, and monitors. These can make a positive difference with employee morale to reduce turnover.\n\nThe next issue is how you approved the raise. Just because the employee asks for a raise you shouldn't just necessarily give a raise.\n\nBut rather you can consider a bonus system. They have clearly established KPI's in their role and if they meet or exceed certain benchmarks, then they get a quarterly bonus.\n\nAs a manager and organization, you have to track individual, department, and organizational KPIs. This helps to quantify what value is being brought and provide commensurate rewards.\n\nAnother tool that people use to reward long term employees is more time off. Some organizations give an extra day of paid vacation for every year with the company.\n\nIf they are getting an extra 5 days of vacation that can be a powerful incentive to stay with the company.\n\nPresuming the employees are stable in their roles and turnover costs the company, this is another way of rewarding employees without ending up with huge (and unaffordable) costs for long tenured resources.\n\nYou need to think about how employees can \"grow in their roles\". Raises and more money should come with more output and more responsibility. Rewards are proportional to what an employee contributes, not only a function of time in. \n\nWhile some organizations emphasize tenure, others take a different approach. \n\nThey are constantly looking to shake things up. Employees never remain stable, turnover is part of their organizations. I know that many consulting companies have that type of work culture. Every two years, either one moves up or moves out.",

In other words, you're *already* paying them significantly less than you did when you hired them.\n\nYou're telling me in five years you've never raised prices for customers? Part of doing so is to pay for things like this. Have your costs gone up? So have theirs, except for stuff like groceries and rent.\n\nYou should have been giving them small percentage point increases per year so you didn't have to suddenly increase your expenses by a large amount, at least so their wages match inflation - and the occasional bonus when years are good (and possibly none if it's been bad and you need to make a business decision to save money).\n\nLoyal employees that do the work and are competent are not as easy to find as you think, especially if you're trying to hire new people at wages that were fair five years ago but are not as good now. Were you overpaying when you hired them then? Search this sub for disaster stories about new employees.\n\nI guarantee you'll be twice as upset if you hire someone new and they disrupt the normal business process with a lack of performance. It's definitely not going to be as seamless as you think the transition will be. Shooting yourself in the foot to save a dollar is shortsighted. And these new people didn't build anything with you - they're probably going to expect yearly raises, because that is *normal* for most companies. If nothing else, you're going to be back in the exact same position in another few years.\n\nI'm not faulting you for wanting to save money in today's economy, just giving you some reality. Five years and no raises is already insane, no good performer should be willing to accept that. I certainly wouldn't.\n\nBut I will also add, admin work with well documented processes sounds like something ripe for automation. If you decide to lay people off anyway, that should be something you explore first. Perhaps it's just because I come from a software background, but I'm much more comfortable replacing a human with a program (giving severance) than with a cheaper human just to save a buck. One is innovation, the other is not rewarding loyalty and institutional knowledge. Before I even hire someone, that's usually the solution I search for/build first.",

People who have typically only ever dealt with stable teams and experienced workers tend to do that. As someone who used to work a *lot* with new hires by virtue of my team being the unofficial puppy mill for the company I was at, I caution you not to take team stability and employee competence for granted. New hire churn comes with a *lot* of costs that people who don't have to deal with them don't usually see or anticipate, and it is very easy to get stuck in a never-ending cycle or turnover if you disrupt a team too much or too often. \n\n\nA new person on average  takes two years  to come up to the efficiency of a fully trained and competent worker. They generally  do not produce more value than they consume (in terms of training and wages) for 3-6months depending on how skilled the role is. Hiring for a role is also expensive, with fees for job listing and cost of time for screening,  interviews,  etc. Add in that, on average,  20-30% of new hires fail probation, and the cost of training (not just financial but also in terms of added workload on yourself and whoever you tap to train them),  legal fees for contracting and the risk of litigation if you fire without cause depending on jurisdiction, the impact of turnover on morale especially if you get a reputation for punishing loyalty, the impact of inexperience on quality and efficiency, the cost of loss of institutional knowledge (not just how things are done but also why) and cost of severance,  and there's a lot more in the cost column of replacing existing people with a lower salary new hire than just wages, and there's not much in the benefit column on it. Generally, it is accepted in HR circles that retaining experience is cheaper and better for the company than lower cost labor if the experienced worker is at least a C player. This is why many companies will pay much more than entry level salaries to retain an experienced employee. Even government jobs, which are often notoriously underpaid compared to private sector in my country, will offer a 2x salary premium  for someone who's been in the role for 10 years over a new hire in the same role. \n\n\nAll of which is to say: don't  look at it as just wages when you evaluate your fiduciary responsibility. Take a big picture view and account for all impacts. ",

Quite a few people on my team have been with us 10 years, some even 20+.\n\nThere’s no short, universal answer here, but I can share how I think about it, if you don’t mind.\n\nFirst, long term relationships are not good by default. They have to create value for both sides. So yes, it’s fair for a company to ask what value it gets, and it’s fair for an employee to do the same.\n\nThat said, the value of a long term employee goes beyond simple math like output per month or salary size.\n\nThere are hidden benefits that are hard to price. You usually notice them only after you lose them, and when you do, the damage can hit the whole system.\n\nLong term employees carry the culture. Culture isn’t something you pick up in six months. It takes years of living in it, and real examples of it in action are what keep it alive.\n\nThey also create trust. When people see others staying for years, it builds a sense of safety and loyalty. Losing a long term employee often shakes that trust more than people expect.\n\nThey hold a lot of knowledge. Yes, things are documented, but even in the best systems a big part of the knowledge lives in people’s heads, not on paper.\n\nAnd when the company hits trouble, long term employees tend to stay. They may not be the cheapest or the absolute best on the market, but in a crisis the choice is often between having them and having a chance to survive, or having nothing and going under.\n\nThat’s where the real value of long term relationships is, at least in my experience.",

The margins on wholesale arent amazing but its consistent money and I can probably negotiate better terms since she clearly needs my product.\n\nWe met for coffee and shes actually super cool.

Only offer exclusivity if volume stays consistent.\nExample:\n“She gets exclusive access to Scent A only if she orders 50+ units every month.”\n\nIf she dips below that: exclusivity ends.\n\n4. Keep your brand identity separate.\nIf she wants private-label (your candles under her branding), raise prices.\nWhite-label should not be priced like standard wholesale.\n\n5. Use the partnership for leverage.\nYou now get to legitimately say:\n\n“Our products are carried by select retailers.”\n\nThat elevates your positioning and builds long-term credibility.\n\n6.

Wholesale margins aren’t huge, but the steady volume helps stabilize cash flow and lets you invest in equipment faster. Since you’re both strong in different parts of the business, the partnership makes sense as long as you set clear boundaries, pricing, and branding rules. It’s one of those situations where two small shops can grow faster together instead of fighting over the same customers.",

But we just got hit by a highly sophisticated scam that I think other importers needs to see.\n\n**The Short Version:** We ordered 1,575 tons of Prime Hot Rolled Coils from a company calling itself **Shandong Baogang Industry Co., Ltd.** (claiming to be Baosteel). We paid a 20% advance. The cargo arrived 3 months late, was 259 tons short, and was all scrap/secondary quality.\n\n**The \"WTF\" Moment:** We flew to Jinan, China to confront them. We went to their office, which had a huge \"Baosteel\" sign behind the reception. We argued for hours and broke for lunch.\n\nWhen we came back early from lunch, we walked in and saw the digital signboard behind the desk had changed. It no longer said \"Baosteel.\" It said **\"Shandong Angang Steel Company Ltd\"** (another massive state-owned mill).\n\nIt turns out it’s a boiler room. They just change the digital logo on the wall depending on which client is visiting that day.\n\n**The Evidence:**\n\n* We did a full forensic weighbridge survey (259 tons missing).\n* We found Chinese court records showing the *real* Baosteel is currently suing them for trademark infringement.\n* They ghosted us after paying a tiny settlement.\n\nI wrote a full report with photos of the office, the inspection reports, and the court records on Medium to warn others. If you are talking to **Ms. April** or **Jack Wu** in Jinan, block them.\n\n**Full Story &amp; Photos here:**[https://medium.com/@pbhatia\\_82865/beware-of-fraud-chinese-steel-supplier-35a5ee1992af](https://medium.com/@pbhatia_82865/beware-of-fraud-chinese-steel-supplier-35a5ee1992af)",

That's ridiculously pretentious. \n\nIf you want to sell commercial art, provide a quote, and when someone pays it, provide the product. It isn't some exploration or journey or community building experience. It's a service. And if it's a hassle to buy it from you, people won't.\n\nFor most small businesses, the logo is not their core product. It is something they need to take care of efficiently. It doesn't have to be perfect at launch. You can swap it later if you need to do so.

But 99.9999% of all other companies logos don't matter at all. Or at least, AI can do just fine. As in, your human created logo is not going to increase your reveue any more than an AI generated logo. Or more accurately, the one logo you liked best out of the many many many logos you can have it make you to choose from. Or the AI logo you then tweaked a little. The effect on revenue is literally all that matters. It being made by a human does not effect that.\n\nHere is your genuine question.  \nShow me an unbiased study comparing AI to human logo and how they performed differently all things otherwise created equally.

I often get sent off-kilter pictures of a printout, or a blurry low res version, or anything but the original file. \n\nI hired a designer (semi-local to me) to make my logo, and they nailed it. It cost me a whole $150. Good investment as far as I’m concerned. I know expenses are tight when you’re starting out but considering the impact a good logo makes, that’s a pretty small investment. And not everyone even really needs a full blown logo either. Your business name in a nice looking font is enough for a lot of businesses out there. It doesn’t make you less official.",

They couldn’t deliver me anything to show, some wanted payment before even delivering a sample, and I just couldn’t get anyone to actually make me anything.\n\nI ended up hiring an artist to do a logo for me. 10/10 I would have just started there if I had really thought about it. When I needed my logo tweaked a bit over time, I hire an artist to do the tweaking. I have never not been satisfied. \n\nThe artist who did the logo for me did it as a line-drawing and I’ve had updates done by a cartoonist as well as a painter that does like old-master work. \n\nI have a different logo/label that we put inside some of our high end handmade things and I had an artist make it to our specs and then hired a person to make me a die, and I have a local printer make me custom printed labels on parchment on demand.\n\nI also do not do business with any company utilizing generative AI on a business level. I don’t use AI in any function of my business. I just can’t get behind it and it does not line up with my values or ethics as a business person.",

The pricing, policies, and consent forms were clearly disclosed and signed. During the appointment, I checked in multiple times, and the client specifically requested a very minimal result. I initially did more and removed strokes at her request. She also has a complimentary touch-up included if she wants additional fullness.\n\nPayment was made using her mother’s credit card (the service was a gift).\n\nAfter the appointment, the client herself did not contact me. Instead, her mother texted me angrily saying the price was “ridiculous,” called my business a scam, and said she was filing a chargeback. I submitted a full evidence packet (signed consent forms, before/after photos, appointment details, policies, etc.), and it appears the bank ruled in my favor.\n\nNow, after the bank decision, the mother has escalated. She has contacted me again - from a different phone number - demanding a refund within 48 hours and threatening:\n\n- Posting negative reviews and “blasting” my business on Google, Facebook, and Instagram\n- Reporting me to the BBB\n- Reporting me to state licensing boards\n- Using “connections” in the industry to harm my business\n\nShe has framed all of this as contingent on me issuing a refund.\n\nI have not heard from the actual client at all, and I have remained professional and brief, redirecting communication to the client herself.\n\nAt this point, this feels less like a service dispute and more like harassment or extortion. I have saved all messages and have not refunded.\n\nMy questions:\n1. Should I reach out to the client via phone call to understand the situation?\n2. Should I reply to the mother?\n3. What should my next steps be?\n4. Has anyone dealt with something similar after winning a chargeback?\n\nI’m trying to handle this correctly and not make things worse. Any advice from business owners or legal-minded folks would be appreciated.\nThank you.",

Start processing today. No real checks.\n\n2. Shortly after, they say funds must be held “for security reasons” while you continue operating normally.\n\n3. You are encouraged to keep selling. Your balance grows. Stripe is happy to let it pile up.\n\n4. The moment funds are due for release, surprise. They suddenly need “additional documentation.”\n\n5. You submit everything requested. IDs, business records, invoices, proof of delivery, everything.\n\n6. After that, Stripe decides they “can no longer service your account” due to vague fraud concerns.\n\n7. They freeze the entire balance indefinitely “in case of chargebacks” and keep the money.\n\n8. Stripe claims they will refund customers. In reality, refunds often never happen.\n\n9. To protect your reputation, you are forced to tell customers to file chargebacks themselves.\n\n10. Stripe then points to those chargebacks as proof that they were right all along.\n\nFull circle. Self-fulfilling justification.\n\nThe reality is this. The account was fine. The transactions were real. The only thing Stripe did consistently was hold customer money while earning interest and shifting all risk onto the merchant.\n\nIf Stripe truly believed the activity was fraudulent, refunds would be issued immediately. Instead, funds sit. Customers wait. Businesses get destroyed.\n\nMore and more investigators are starting to recognize this pattern for what it is. This isn’t “risk management.” It’s systematic fund retention disguised as compliance.\n\nThis will come back around. And when it does, Stripe won’t be able to hide behind boilerplate emails and trust-and-safety buzzwords anymore.\n\nIf you’ve experienced this, speak up. Silence is exactly what lets this continue.",

          "body": "This pattern is real, but I think it’s less a secret “fraud playbook” and more a structural failure that hits small operators disproportionately.\n\nStripe isn’t actually deciding whether you’re honest or not. Their risk systems are deciding whether your business is *legible under stress*. When something trips a flag, the question isn’t “were these transactions real?” It’s “can this merchant produce a clean, auditable narrative fast enough that our internal confidence threshold clears?” Most can’t — not because they’re doing anything wrong, but because their ops live across inboxes, spreadsheets, Stripe metadata, and half-documented workflows.\n\nAt that point, the default outcome is account offboarding. Holding funds isn’t malicious so much as the path of least internal risk. It looks predatory from the outside because the merchant has zero leverage and no way to reduce uncertainty once the decision process starts.\n\nThis also isn’t unique to Stripe. PayPal, Square, Shopify Payments all behave similarly once volume or velocity crosses a line. The common failure mode is the same: founders are running real businesses, but their operational proof is fragmented.\n\nThis is one of the reasons we’re building Quorum (still in beta): not as a payments alternative and definitely not a magic fix for Stripe, but as infrastructure so businesses aren’t scrambling when a platform suddenly asks them to “prove legitimacy.” Centralized customers, jobs, invoices, inventory, fulfillment — basically making your operation readable instead of reconstructing it under pressure.\n\nIt doesn’t solve the power imbalance, but it can shrink the blast radius.  \nFor anyone curious: [https://usequorum.app](https://usequorum.app)",

First I would ask your vendor connections for insight on your venue.  If you dont have vendor friends (luxury planners and photographers)  that's your problem ! The wedding industry is built on customer service relationships. Reach out to the ones you liked working with the most in the last 2 years. They are the ones referring your clients !\n\nSometimes brides will book planners and photographers before they book their venue ! So make sure your venue is on their most - requested list.\nIf you dont have that start here....\n\n-Does your space need updates?  (Lighting, ease of use, parking , electrical , LANDSCAPING - genz brides want lots of places to take pictures. Make sure no area looks old and shitty ..historic is great, outdated and crumbling is not.) \n\n-Is your bridal suite amazing (open space with natural lighting and cozy furniture)  - this is where the future brides can imagine themselves getting ready with their closest friends - this is a big selling point. Consult with beauty vendors in your area!\n\n- is your venue difficult to work with ? (No good rain plan area, limited time to access, bad parking for guests, awkward layout for the wedding  ) \n\n- does it come with good catering?  Do brides have to pay for every small thing or do you include a lot?\n\nIs your venue able to accommodate other groups such as showers, parties , dinners ? Many venues in my area offer \nBrunches and special dinners (holidays ) to bring in off season money.\n\n\nYour seo and marketing might be good in paper but are you looking at your venue as a bride ? Would you drop 30k on your venue ? Maybe go tour your competition and see what they offer. \n\nWedding venues should make absolutely bank. The most successful in my area do 3 weddings per weekend in our busy season - fri/sat /sun,  have amazing catering and charge $30k-45k base . Depending on your area you might get 6 months of busy season and if you have a nice indoor options you could operate in the \"off season \" 12 months a year.",

Trivia nights, game nights (if you have outdoor space something like a cornhole tournament with local breweries) or whatever hobbies the twenty something’s are into. Plant swapping on a weekday morning (getting the parents/grandparents in), or even a farmers market early Sundays once a month.  If you’re urban, craft swaps, art shows, comedy shows…etc. Getting more people to your location will get more people thinking about your space.

Bringing people in from the local community and giving them a positive experience may help spread a good reputation of your venue by word of mouth. After all, everyone has some cousin, niece, child, sibling, friend, etc. that is going to be in the market for a wedding or other event venue at some time or another. You could even get creative and try to organize something within a small, tight knit community like prom/dances for homeschooled students, hosting banquets to benefit local veterans, or try to connect yourself in some way to the local chamber of commerce?",

This is my first comment on something in small business sub. \n\nYour situation is likely a marketing and customer relations issue.\n\nSaying the market has changed or slowed or what ever is a cop-out. Market conditions are always changing and it’s the owner/operators job to predict and plan for every scenario. As an entrepreneur you’re always going to have times where you’re flying a little to close to the sun. \n\nSo in this situation I would ask - who is your target customer and how do you get in front of them? \n\nWell the question is nuanced because who is the real decision maker? The groom? The bride? The planner? The mother of bride? The person who’s paying for it? … every situation is different. \n\nBut there is one thing that is constant… the planner. If you want consistency in your business you need to build airtight relationships with all the planners in the area so that when they do a venue presentation you’re always on the list. \n\nBut how do you do that? Well here is the “fun” part. You have to work the phones and door knock. Small gifts work too once you have a budding relationship. Pick the top 100 planners and make it your mission to get in contact with all of them over the next 30 days. Sometimes it means showing up to their office or phone calls or mailers. And make sure to build a deep personal relationship when you have a planner on-site. Also - All this has to be you - very important - can’t hire this out. \n\nLast thing is the planners are going to ask “what’s in it for me”. As you know most planners take a percentage of vendor sales which is often disclosed in the contract with the client. Figure out appropriate incentives for the planners based on the industry standard.\n\nThis is the hard target market that nobody wants to work. Much harder than buying an ad or writing an SEO page. Well in business that’s where the money is  - the boring hard stuff",

You do look to be next to an apartment complex, which is good. Can you add a soda fountain, look into starting a coffee part of the business, or something else? Is there another niche that fits in with candy that you can add? \n\nAlso, you might want to consult an interior designer. When I’m buying from a locally owned store, I like it cozy and like to have lots of stuff to look at. This gives convenience store vibes and doesn’t really encourage browsing so much as driving in to buy one thing you want that you can’t get elsewhere. \n\nYour concept may need some tweaking if you want this to be sustainable. \n\nLastly, free samples are a great way to boost sales. If someone tries something they find out they like and then they buy it for many years to come, that’s bank for you. Can you open a new candy every day, cut it into bite-size pieces, and (don’t forget to list allergens) give those out?

But then those leads bounce when they hit the site.\n\nThe ad will be specific to their offering with a great hook that gets people interested. \n\nBut then they'll send that lead to the main business website. And that website lists 5 services that don't match the offer. Now the lead is lost and they bounce.\n\nI saw this recently with someone running ads for legal coaching. His ad had a click-through rate that you'd think would generate a 4x or so return on ad spend. But he was barely at 2x. Not at all terrible but was definitely missing out.\n\nWith a separate landing page just for the coaching, the same ad started to perform at a 3x. \n\nThe disconnect is expensive. You're paying for clicks on a specific offer, then confusing people when they land.\n\nIf you're advertising coaching, the landing page should only show coaching. If you're advertising meal prep, only show meal prep.\n\nIt should be this simple:\n\n* What is your offer?\n* Does the page you're sending them to deliver ONLY that thing?\n\nIf not, make a simple landing page first. Even a basic one-pager should perform better than a generic homepage. ",

      "selftext": "Ive owned a small hair salon for the last 12 years in NYC. When I say small, I mean we do everything “office” related from home since there’s no office in the salon. \n\nWe have several reports that we reference that have taken years to populate with sales data. Over 50 documents in Excel and Word that represent hundreds of hours of data entry and analysis. I use these reports to make my cash projection, coach my staff, make purchasing decisions: the list is endless.\n\nStarting in 2024, we used office 365 exclusively for these reports since my front desk manager and I do this work from our home computers and it was the most simple and reliable for up to date access. I mistakenly assumed that because the documents were in the cloud, this was the equivalent of having a backup.\n\nThis August, Microsoft had a problem processing my credit card on file for the annual fee (it had expired) and instead of notifying any of us on the app when we used the documents,  they sent two emails in November that looked like spam notifying me that the account was about to be cancelled. I opened the email, figured out the problem, and updated the payment info. Microsoft charged me on November 16.\n\nThe next day, November 17th, all of our documents were gone. All of them. \nI’ve spent the last 3 weeks on a series of calls with offshore support people that hang up on me when I ask to speak with a supervisor. The first week they charged me again, opened a ticket, and then called me several mornings at 7 AM to tell me they were working on it.\n\nMore phone calls, more hangups. Yesterday I found another phone number for tech support, and got someone on the phone that explained to me that all of those people had been trying to tell me that my documents were gone. \n\nObviously I should have been backing them up separately but I mistakenly thought by using the cloud system, I was.  Recreating these will take my front desk manager and I hours. This was another painful lesson in small business ownership that I had to learn by f**king up. \n\nTL:DR:\nI used Microsoft Office 365 for cloud storage and they lost over 50 Excel and Word documents that took is years to create.\n\nEdited to add: Thanks everyone for telling me I should have backed up the cloud, I agree. It's helpful to hear how everyone has their backups established. Moving forward I'll have something better set up. To me, the most painful part of being the owner of a small business is having to be an expert in everything, and when you fall short it's potentially catastrophic.",

The first time we visited the owner introduced himself, showed up to our table, recommended dishes, and overall made for a very pleasant experience. The restaurant is a bistro with very nice e decorations and cool jazz music in the background that was low enough for guests to hear themselves while speaking.\n\nOur second visit was a much different experience. No owner, no recommendations, and semi-attentive waitresses (all college age) that gave cursory service; but the worst of all was rap music being played very loud to a level where it was hard to hear anything at all. \n\nMy opinion is that the waitresses/cook/ staff changed the music and arrangements to what they liked, notwithstanding what the customers would like. \n\nAs a small business, it should be paramount to present a pleasant atmosphere that draws in customers.

No one but a lawyer is going to be able to give you legal advice and stand behind it (you can sue a lawyer for malpractice if something is wrong, and they have insurance). Everyone else is a waste of money (looking at CPAs, other than tax advice). Lawyers you can ask questions and understand why things are done the way they are done. No one else is qualified to answer you without a disclaimer (which means they are not responsible for what they tell you).\n\n$1800 is a bit high, I was charging $1000. It doesn't matter if it is a single or a multiple, the benefit of a LLC doesn't depend on how many members, but how it is being operated. If you can read 2 different copies of LLC OA and can meaningly understand the differences, you don't need a lawyer.

They ask a few simple questions and then walk you through it. I imagine most states will have a similar thing. \n\nSecond most affordable is legalzoom and maybe will give you extra peace of mind/ease, so although they will upcharge you, it’s way less than a lawyer. \n\nLastly $1800 is actually a pretty affordable quote if you do want to go that route.

      "selftext": "Hello, I’m new here. My name’s Gary. I’m in my late 50s and, to put it bluntly, **I feel ‘stuck’ inside my own business**. At the risk of sounding defeatist, I feel like I’m in a fun-free loop, grinding slowly towards failure.\n\nFor over a decade I’ve run my own small video production company. I stumbled into it after being made redundant following the Financial Crisis. At first it felt exciting and full of possibility: travel, interesting projects, big hopes for creative freedom and financial stability. But over time, the reality has drifted a long way from the dream.\n\nThe industry changed faster than I could adapt, with bigger agencies moving into *my* small pond, more companies built in-house content teams, and now artifical blah blah blah intelligence has reached the point where large parts of our work can be done with a laptop and a few prompts, for peanuts. I’m working harder and harder for less reward, with shrinking creative freedom and a lower and lower ceiling on what the business could realistically become. It’s know it’s not going to be enough to give me the future I was hoping for. \n\nSomewhere along the way, this stopped feeling like something I chose and now feels like something I’m chained to. The only future I can see at the moment is bleak: a worn-out version of me, grinding away into my 60s and beyond, unable to retire properly and too tired to keep going. Ten years of sunk effort makes walking away feel like failure — but struggling on feels just as hopeless, to be honest. \n\nIs this a midlife crisis? I’m not sure. But, I worry about trying to find salaried work at my age. I spent ten years in recruitment advertising as an art director, so I can speak with authority when I say that going back into full-time employment and earning what I need in my late 50s is unrealistic. Objectively speaking, the fear is real.\n\nMaybe this is the 21st century reality for a lot of people at my age, who feel boxed in by the lives they’ve tried to build. Anyway, it’s how I feel right now, so I’m asking — genuinely:\n\n**Is anyone else going through something like this?**\n\n**Do you feel stuck in your career or business?**\n\n**How are you thinking about your future?**\n\n**Have you found any direction — or do you feel as stuck as I do, whether you’re in a salaried job or running your own thing?**  \n  \nThanks for taking the time to read.  \nAny shared thoughts will be truly appreciated.",

If he showed up by 11:30am I'd almost count that as being on time, and then usually he was off to the 'office store' by 2pm, which was code for going to the bar.  He stopped paying some of our suppliers, our landlord and our tax debts and verbally abused me into a shell of myself over the years.  In January 2020 he didn't show up to work and I had to break into his apartment to find him dead and naked on the floor of his bedroom.  It broke me.  I've been dealing with a lot of PTSD and anxiety issues since then.  I disappeared into my own hole of drugs and alcohol for a few years before snapping out of it.\n\nIt took me too long to realize I was in charge and could change things, but the business has been better since he passed.  I've recommitted myself to growing as a graphic designer and the quality of our finished product is so much higher now that I'm not drifting through life in a haze of weed and anxiety.  We're in a spot where we're growing and making smart business decisions, but I still don't have the cash flow I need to replace our nearly 20 year old equipment or hire on a salesman.  It always feels like we take two steps forward and then the forklift breaks down... we make real good progress redesigning the website and then the electrical box that powers our compressor pops and we've got bills I can't cover.  We always find our way through, but I know that my retirement plan is waiting for my parents to pass away, which isn't fun at all.  Sorry for the trauma dump!  I don't have too many people in the real world I can talk to about it.",

Riding that excitement and trusting my network, I started doing my own job in interior design, graphic design etc. In the beginning, it was fine, but over time I got stuck in a repetitive cycle. I kept telling myself, “This time i will reach my goal, next month, next year I’ll succeed,” and 7 years have passed. Now a truth that I didn’t want to see, has surfaced.\n\nI hesitate to look for a “normal” job because I feel like people will say, “You’ve been away from your field for so long,” so I don’t even apply. I’ve done a lot independently, and I know that compared to an office employee, I can manage projects and handle all the tough processes much faster and better, because running your own business isn’t just technical work, it’s managing the whole process.\n\nBut I feel like independent work isn’t seen as “real work,” and it’s hard to provide proof of your achievements. Continuing my own business means always looking for new clients, earning money from whatever you find, working for free for days. I no longer have goals of making money in this field, nor the excitement to create amazing work.\n\nSeeing my network on LinkedIn with their fancy titles and constant promotions depresses me. We’re in the same industry, but in my own business, they're doing only a small part of my business and that makes them managers.\n\nSo I think this feeling is not about age, but about a reality check. And I feel like breaking this cycle might mean joining a structured system, getting a job. I hope.",

          "body": "I understand the feeling of being trapped. \n\nMid-60's here and it's been very difficult the last couple of years. We're a smaller specialist agency that has very large and mid-sized enterprises for clients. Almost all of the web development we used to do is done offshore (we decided not to become an offshore agency years ago). We pivoted to high-value services that aren't easily done offshore, which helps; but the volume for an engagement is more typically in the low tens of thousands of $ instead of the hundreds of thousands. We lost our whale client a year ago and it's been a deep hole.\n\nI've explored partnering/being acquired by other companies in my business, but it's a hard sell because our business is down. So I feel forced to make this business work. I've been through the downs and ups over the last 30+ years, so it's not unrealistic to make this happen--I've done it a couple times before--but I'm getting tired of having to retrench and start over. I feel my age in that respect. And like you, I doubt that I could find a job that pays what I need--and who's hiring someone my age? So I have to make this business work better once again.\n\nWhat I take away from my experience is that I should have sold years ago when we were on an upward path. I didn't because the good times were rolling and I had built my little one-person operation into a high 7-figure, profitable company that had 60+ employees and a million dollars in cash on hand. That would have been a great time to sell. Instead I invested in a product development that I really believed in but that didn't pan out, and kept the company going when things went down. \n\nIf I had made some different decisions, I would be retired now, comfortably. As it is, I can't retire any time in the foreseeable future. Ironically, I've had a number of employees who made it all the way to retirement working in my company--I'm somewhat proud of that, almost like launching my kids in a way. But I don't share in it at this point. \n\nI don't know what the answer is, and in my business a big win can change things considerably. But I can't count on that and my runway seems shorter, and I should have become more risk-adverse with respect to putting money away rather than investing in the business--which I saw as investing in myself. That was a mistake. Those are two separate tracks. I'm in the process of figuring it out and, unlike running my business, this all seems new and not comfortable. \n\nI don't know if any of this is helpful, except maybe to say you're not alone.",

All 3 of my original partners have moved on to other things, but as a director/editor I’ve always been the most in demand. I would not be able to make nearly as much money in-house somewhere. So I press on wearing lots of hats and with a stable of freelance collaborators.\n\nAI is a tool. It is going to be used to save time and money (already cutting out transcription/translation turnarounds and scanning through footage in seconds) but the need for content is going nowhere. Brands that take themselves seriously will continue to spend money on advertising content. Someone will need to be behind the curtain using all of the tools available to create.\n\nAnd brands want to work with someone they can trust to manage a project from start to finish with all the bumps along the way as well as execute. Hard to come by in my experience. I’ve also seen companies “save money” this year by working only “in-house” and then just white labeling with us. This has meant less competitive bidding, and has worked out well.\n\nBeing a creative who keeps the books, runs payroll, handles insurance, manages the office/equipment/crew with a smile is unique. It sounds like you being a lot to the table. Find the opportunities at each brand/agency/org where you can add value. I even did payroll-only for $500k in work for a friend that’s in-house at a big brand because their AP is such a mess that they were losing vendors.\n\nWhen things were dead at the beginning of the year due to tariff fears, I called all of my contacts and asked them what their needs were. Since June it’s become our second best year ever. Plenty of factors out of our control, but if you were full time you’d have to be worried about layoffs, so try to use your strengths and experience to fill clients needs whatever they may be. Easier said, but I’ve been on the rollercoaster for a long time now and I’m still optimistic about the future of our industry. Good luck!",

      "selftext": "Hello, the title hopefully clearly describes my situation. I purchased a business 5 months ago and have been discovering that there are customer accounts that show a total of nearly $150k in credit. \n\nCustomers paid a deposit toward the purchase of items that needed to be ordered prior to my ownership of the business, and I have been completing the sale of these items since then using the \"credit\" that they have on their accounts. There was no bank account included in the sale of this business, so there is essentially no money supporting the sales that are made with credit.\n\nIf this isn't making sense, I'll add some numbers and dates. \nLet's say that a customer wanted to purchase an item with MSRP of $10k on August 1st. The item wasn't in stock and had to be ordered, so the customer paid a $5k deposit on August 1st, the credit is added to their customer account and the item was ordered. I purchased the business on September 1st, previous owner said there was no business bank account (which seemed likely enough). On September 15th, the item arrives, customer is notified and comes in pays the remaining $5k of the $10k and takes the item. So essentially I only actually get $5k from this sale. The kicker is that I get a bill for the item on October 1 for $6k (the cost of the item), so now I actually lost $1k from the sale. This scenario happens dozens of times in slightly different variations.\n\nThe point of sale software shows $0 on August 1st and $10k on September 15th (even though the money actually hit the bank on the 1st) so I assumed it was all good on the 15th.\n\nMany items were ordered and sold, and it has taken me a long time to understand what has occurred. \n\nWhat do I do now? How do I recover the money?\n\nOne more thing, I'm paying for the purchase.of the business over time, the seller essentially financed that sale, so I figure I should be able to subtract the $150k from what I still.owe on the purchase... Right?\n\nEDIT: **The other part of this is that I worked for the business as an employee before I purchased it from the owner, so I saw that we were successful and knew that it was making good money, though I had no way of seeing the true financials in my role.",

Tell them you feel that both he and you have made some huge errors in assessing and transitioning this business, and you want to work together to resolve them.\n\nMake no threats or illusions to anything messy, like a lawsuit.  Be humble, be gracious, seek common ground.\n\nAsk to sit down and go through all of the current outstanding orders, and have him tell you which ones he collected deposits on, and how much on each.\n\nTell him you've learned these should have been on his books as unearned revenue liabilities.  Also tell him that you've discovered through research that usually businesses are sold with a working capital adjustment, which is a post-closing true-up to adjust the purchase price.  An average working capital target (current assets minus current liabilities) should have been negotiated as part of the purchase price.\n\nWhen buying a business, buyers write two checks: the purchase price (or down payment) and a working capital deposit into the new business bank account.\n\nFor example, had you set a working capital target before closing and a customer comes in between the target set date and the closing, and paid a $10,000 deposit, and the target is $0, the price should be adjusted by $10,000 in your favor, since the seller takes home the $10,000 and you have to fund it.\n\nI know this is a lot but try this and comment back if you need help.

          "body": "What you’re running into isn’t a POS glitch. It’s a timing and ownership issue that just wasn’t visible before.\n\nThose customer deposits weren’t revenue. They were liabilities. The business owed customers either product or a refund. When you bought the business without the cash that came with those deposits, you inherited the obligation but not the money that funded it.\n\nSo in your example:\n\nCustomer pays $5k deposit before you own the business\n\nThat $5k should have been sitting in cash, offset by a customer credit liability\n\nYou didn’t receive that cash at purchase\n\nWhen you complete the sale, you collect the remaining $5k, but you still pay the full $6k vendor bill\n\n\nThat’s why it feels like you “lost” money on each sale. Economically, the loss already existed at purchase — it just shows up over time as you fulfill those orders.\n\nA few important points:\n\n1. You generally can’t recover this from customers. They already paid what they owed.\n\n\n2. This is something to raise with the seller, because those customer credits should have been addressed in the purchase price or paid out at closing. It’s very common for this to be handled as a purchase price adjustment.\n\n\n3. No, you shouldn’t unilaterally subtract $150k from what you owe without talking to a lawyer or CPA, but yes — conceptually, this is exactly the kind of issue that gets netted against seller financing if the contract allows it.\n\n\n4. Going forward, you should track customer deposits explicitly as a liability so this stops being invisible.\n\n\n\nYou didn’t suddenly discover that the business “wasn’t profitable.” You discovered that part of the balance sheet didn’t come with the sale. That’s a painful realization, but it’s also a solvable one once it’s clearly identified.",

Still, sloppy accounting (and shady on their part). \n\nThere’s a chance he was out of cash and wouldn’t be able to fulfill the orders and was using you as a capital injection. As long as the business is profitable and you can deduct the extra amount you’re putting in from what you owe, you can navigate out of the situation if you have enough capital.

          "body": "I literally work in corporate gifting for a living. Typically larger companies, bigger budgets either by way of quantity or quality.  This is my two cents.. \n1. If you do a logo, make it small and subtle. A little icon or something less obvious is a good way to brand something without taking away usability. Using a mug as an example, a basic ceramic one with a loud logo will be the first i declutter. A nice quality one with a subtle logo would be more appreciated. \n2. If you’re not doing your own decoration, don’t pay extra to get it done. You care more about the logo than anyone receiving it. \n3. If it’s low budget, don’t buy junk… just get a giftcard. We can design beautiful gift boxes but $20 doesn’t go far without looking cheap. With a $20 amazon gift card, i can put it towards that thing I wanted, A pair of socks looks cheap. If you really want to do swag, then give something small, knowing it may be trashed, but give something else with it, like a giftcard. \n4. Echoing 3, but don’t buy the cheap version of something. A $10 cooler is still a $10 cooler… probably not very good. \n5. Real examples of interesting swag I’ve seen (not just more expensive everything): leather goods like nice coasters, key fobs, and Dopp kits. Tech organizers. Hand thrown mug with small stamped logo. Custom keyboards. Olive wood cooking utensils. Hot pads/ oven mitts. Glass togo container. Wireless charger. Mixed reactions on journals.. small accessory to go with a themed gift- ex- coffee scoop with nice coffee, chopsticks with a ramen gift, popcorn bowl with movie theme, candle snuffer with spa theme. \n\nSmall tip for anyone ordering swag. ALWAYS order more than you need, especially when on a clock. Almost every company will send a few with misprints. Obviously returns depend on the vendor, but there’s always an error",

Every quarter, it’s always a battle to get all the receipts from him and organized and I absolutely dread it. I work part time already in my own job, but I pick up a lot of shifts too. His business has continued to grow and taxes are getting more and more complicated adding on the house flipping and rental income. I used to have just 1 excelsheet for his LLC and now I have like 4 for all of his different business ventures. It’s December again and I already know this will consume and ruin my month. He is just not good at bookkeeping and I know if he tried to do it himself he would miss major things. I feel resentful to him because I feel like this is falling on my shoulders and I’m done with it. When I try to tell him this, he says it is “our business” and I benefit from the money made in the business. I think it might be time to hire a bookkeeper for my sanity and for the sake of our marriage…. Thoughts anyone? Rant over lol. \n\nEdit: I also manage our Airbnb and do all the cleanings/turnovers myself. I don’t mind doing this, but it is just one more thing on my plate. ",

I wanted her to be and we figured out she could do the books and handle some calls.  It was a small contracting service business so maybe 5-10 hours a week.  I thought it was perfect and it kept her in the loop and a part of things.   Long story short, things weren’t getting done, slow to get done or not the way I wanted.   Now I had to walk the fine line of not talking to her like an employee.  As we grew, we ran into exactly what you described.   I slowly started doing more of the office work and she noticed.

An e-commerce site converts on average at around 2%.  That means 1 out of 50 people will leave without buying, and leave you without any value from them.  The most you can really do to get them back is retarget them with paid ads.\n\nIf you're losing 49 out of 50 people anyway, but you convert 10% or more of visitors into email subscribers, well now you have 5 or more high-intent potential customers that you can market to forever (until they unsubscribe).\n\nIt may be worth losing 1 buyer in the short term to gain 5.  And considering they typically offer a discount or something with the email submit, that may also increase their overall conversion rate.\n\nIt'll be different for all products and all sites in terms of how it actually works out, but I'm sure that's the theory behind it :).",
