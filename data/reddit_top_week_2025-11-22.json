I'm doing all the heavy lifting. She just puts the bottles in the bag. \n\nI came to find out that the recycling centre has bins they can drop on site and they also offer to empty them once a week. Booked the bins, booked the pick ups and now I'm set to collect basically free money. \n\nThe owners didn't seem bothered to know what I was doing and agreed to give me the next year's worth of recycling if I took care of things. \n\nI'm tempted to just call restaurants and hit them up for this scheme. \n\n\nHas anyone done this? It's nuts the owners of the restaurant are so lazy.",

      "selftext": "I stumbled into this completely by accident and now I'm kicking myself for not starting sooner. I was scrolling through Instagram and saw some lifestyle bloggers with decent followings but their websites were... rough. Slow loading times, no internal linking, missing alt tags - basic stuff that kills their Google rankings. So I sent a few DMs. Something like: *\"Hey, love your content! Just checked your site and noticed a few quick fixes that could boost your traffic. Would you be interested in a site optimization? I can have it done this week.\"*\n\nThe response rate shocked me. Out of 10 messages, 2-3 people responded interested. They were RELIEVED someone reached out. Most of them know their site has issues but have no idea how to fix it or think it'll cost thousands.\n\nWhat I actually do:\n\n* Run their site through free tools (PageSpeed Insights, Screaming Frog)\n* Fix image compression and lazy loading\n* Add internal links between their posts (I use help of AI for this - automates the whole thing in like 5 mins)\n* Update meta descriptions and titles\n* Fix broken links\n* Find ideas for content (thanks to competitors analysis which is also performed by this tool)\n\nTotal time: 20-30 minutes per site. Charge: $100. The best part?\n\nThese bloggers are genuinely happy. Their sites load faster, they start seeing better rankings, and they think I'm some kind of wizard. Meanwhile I'm literally just following a checklist I learned from YouTube.\n\nI'm doing 4-5 of these per week now. That's an extra $400-500 for maybe 3 hours of actual work (not counting the hours spent looking for such guys)\n\nI can't tell you where and how exactly I find these people because honestly, I don't need more competition in my niche 😂 But let's just say there are platforms where content creators hang out and complain about their website problems...\n\nMy advice if you want to try this:\n\n1. Learn basic SEO fixes (literally just watch a few YouTube videos)\n2. Find people with content but bad websites\n3. Reach out professionally, don't be spammy\n4. Deliver quick results\n5. Ask for testimonials to build credibility\n\nThe barrier to entry is incredibly low. You don't need to be an expert - you just need to know slightly more than the person you're helping.\n\nAnyone else doing something similar? Or am I the only opportunist here taking advantage of people's laziness to Google things? 😅",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I posted this in another subreddit and I got some heartwarming messages that it inspired them, so I'm going to share this with you, hopefully it can inspire some of you as well. (I don't have anything to sell, don't worry.)\n\nI’ve been doing Amazon KDP (Amazon's self publishing platform) since August of 2024, a little over a year now. It is possible to do it on the side, I didn't because I started with nothing. Literally. No money, living out of my car, and I needed to do something about my situation. I want to share my full experience scaling this from $0 to $150K revenue. The lessons I learned, and why I think KDP is nowhere near saturated as many claim.\n\nMy hope is that this post will give you value, motivation, and perspective, especially if you’re just starting out or feel stuck.\n\n# A Little Background\n\nI’ve always been into business, ever since i was a kid flipping Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh cards and other collectibles, plus video game currencies, items, accounts. Over the years I’ve tried everything: forex, stock trading, affiliate marketing, SEO blogs, dropshipping, customer acquisition/lead generation agency, CPA marketing, SMMA, POD, and of course KDP.\n\nJust to keep in mind, this is not my first time doing KDP. My first attempt was in 2019, but my account got banned in early 2020 for a few (frustrating) reasons:\n\n* I used a term, that a few months later got filled for trademark and Amazon flagged me, even tho the trademark was just pending and was rejected later.\n* Got hit with a “similar cover” strike ( I should have fought it, probably would have won. Not sure why I didn’t.)\n* Published a book called “Snarky Nurse Coloring Book” with the idea that the book was snarky (snarky quotes), not the nurse. Tt got reported by a brand called Snarky Nurse or something similar.\n\nAfter the third strike, Amazon didn’t let me appeal or explain myself, they kept sending the same generic response that the decision is final and nothing could be done.\n\nAfter all this I didn’t do anything, I got comfortable, had plenty in savings, some other life events happened during covid that I lost any motivation to do anything, until life forced me to start again.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nI’m not smart or special. Many people make much more with KDP than I do. But I’ve failed a lot, learned from my mistakes, and treated this like a real business. What I’ll share is what worked for me. Hopefully you’ll learn something useful from it and get some clarity on how you should approach this business if you decide to give it a shot.\n\n# Quick Stats:\n\n* Started: August 2024.\n* Books Published 148. (1 book every 3 days or so)\n* Total Revenue: \\~$150,000\n* Ad Spend: \\~$16,000\n* Employee Costs: \\~$24,000\n* Tools &amp; Subscriptions: \\~$2,500\n* TikTok Marketing Videos: \\~2,000\n* Profit (before tax): \\~100,000\n\nLast month, I made \\~$32,000 revenue, with \\~$10,000 in expenses.\n\n# Lessons, Tests &amp; Observations:\n\n1. **Quality vs. Quantity.** I’ve seen many YouTubers talk about focusing only on quality and to be honest I don’t fully agree. I started with quantity, not because I believed in mass publishing, but because I wanted data. I uploaded many somewhat decent quality books at first (most didn’t even hit 10 sales) and they helped me to identify which niches and formats had potential. Then I moved to more medium quality books, they took me 2-5 days each, in niches that showed potential and these confirmed the winners. I then outsourced even better versions and that’s where most of my revenue came from (excluding the unicorn). So it’s not quality or quantity, you need both to optimize your business.\n2. **Amazon ads.** I’m a numbers guy, I love data, tracking, testing everything. With amazon ads you obviously get more sales, but you also get an 20-30% bump in the organic sales. Sales boost your BSR, help you rank higher, which gets you more sales, more reviews, and all of this combined, a stronger foundation in the algorithm, making it more difficult for competitors to outrank you. So yes, ads are worth it, even beyond direct ROI. There’s another reason why I find ads even more important than getting sales. To be honest I didn’t even start them with the idea to make money from them directly. As I said, I love data, and amazon unfortunately shows you almost no valuable data at all. Running ads helps you a little bit as you can see the impressions you get, how many clicks you get and how many conversions, enough signal to see what’s working and what isn’t. It’s not ideal, but this is what we have to deal with when it comes to amazon.\n3. **Keywords.** Always use relevant keywords, leave fields if you don’t have anything relevant to add. I tested adding trending but not relevant keywords on a couple of books that had \\~20 sales a month each. Sales dropped to 4 and 6 the first month and 1 and 0 on the second month. Removing those irrelevant keywords didn’t restore the sales. Only running ads brought them back. Unrelated words hurt your relevance score, which can tank your book entirely\n4. **External ads.** I had some experimentation with meta ads, spend $600 and made \\~$450 above baseline over the next few months (sales doubled the month with the ads being run and slowly fell back to baseline). Still not enough data to fully judge, I’ll test this more, I need to spend at least $10,000 to have at least some opinion about this, and that’s what I’m going to do in the upcoming months.\n5. **A+ Content.** Almost always helps unless it’s really, really bad. I’ve tested many different layouts, worst ones had \\~10% increase in CVR, the best ones increased 80-150%, depending on the niche and design. Either way, it helps.\n6. **Cover Design (not just artsy, its psychology).** After niche selection, cover is the most important factor. People do judge a book by it’s cover If your design isn’t at least as good as top competitors in that niche, your book is gonna sink in the vast ocean that is Amazon. If you can afford it and your design skills aren’t great, I would suggest outsourcing covers to skilled designers. Still, do some of them yourself, to have a better understanding as not all of it is art, it’s more about the psychology of the customer, it is the pitch for your product. (Also the content of the book has to be good enough as well, because negative reviews can kill your book just as easily as bad cover, just a little slower).\n7. **Descriptions.** I’m not sure if I am just bad at writing them, but I never seen a big difference in CVR from it. The only thing that seems to matter in my experience is the formatting. The description still has to be informative and relevant to the book itself, but if it’s done in a big block of text it’s not gonna help. If it is formatted nicely, then I’ve seen 10-30% CVR improvements. The other thing that I’ve noticed is that having a relevant and informative description helps the book rank higher. It happened consistently enough to make me almost sure that Amazon’s algorithm rewards it.\n8. **Low Search Volume Niches (Small Margins Scale Big).** Pretty much every YouTube video I watched about KDP said to target niches that have high search volume of 1000+ at the minimum and ignore every one of them that get less. I often target niches other skip, even less than 500 searches per month. I care more about competitor strength and actual sales. If I feel I have a fighting chance against the competitor in that kind of niche, that has 100-200k BSR, then I’ll attack it. I get it, making books that are going to get 100-200 sales a month isn’t sexy, but over the year they make $1,200-$2,400, and ten, twenty, thirty, one hundred of these adds up to real income.\n9. **E-mail Lists.** These are great but I’ve only managed to make them work in two situations. In my unicorn niche, I built a list of 1,000+ via a variety of freebies. When I launched a supporting book with a release day discount, I emailed the list and got 200+ day one sales. I’m not saying that 20% of the email list converted, but even if 3-4% can create enough sales velocity to push the book up the rankings making it get even more sales and climb even higher up. Second, with my “client” brand (consumable books). We built the list by running promotional ads and in book freebies. After every weekly release, the email goes out and almost consistently gets 100 day one sales, some releases even get 200-300.\n10. **Short-Form Video Marketing.** One day I got bored and thought about trying out something new, I released a book in a very competitive niche(which means lot’s of interested people) and created a TikTok account to make videos for that book. After printing the book and recording a few videos, repurposing them, following trends, changing the hooks , etc., one video hit nearly 1m views. This led to over 2,000 sales in the first week after upload. Since then I’ve uploaded 250+ videos, hired other people to make videos for me and I’ve had a few other viral videos (not as bit as the original one tho).\n11. **Pricing.** Compete on the quality of your book rather than price, if your book is better than competitor’s, price it higher and position it as premium. Low price makes you look cheap, not “affordable”. The pricing is different depending on the niche and type of the book itself, so what I would recommend is to launch around the average competitor price, could be a little higher if you are confident in your book (that’s what I do), or price it just a little below the average. Monitor CVR, if it is solid, then increase the price by $1 and observe, if it gets too big of a hit, reverse the change if it doesn’t keep increasing the price. If the book ranks high, gets steady organic sales and reviews, push premium pricing.\n12. **99% of Gamblers Give Up Before They Hit it Big.** Okay, maybe not in gambling (please don’t). But in business? Mostly true. Most people give up right before they’ve learned enough both from theirs, and other people’s failures to make their business work. There’s plenty of money in almost every business. Imagine a gambler spinning the slots, after 30 failed spins, he hits jackpot. Business it’s similar, keep testing, keep learning, fail, tweak it, try again. Do that 30 times and on attempt 31 it suddenly looks like you “got lucky”(You didn’t. You just didn’t quit.) If you knew that you were 30 failures away from your dream, would you keep going?\n13. AI Tools as Assistants, Not Crutches Do not let AI do all the work for you. You won’t really learn what’s working and the quality will be subpar. People notice that the book was written by AI and leave negative reviews. Use it to brainstorm ideas, rough outlines, keyword ideas that you’re gonna validate, even sketch A+ layouts. Always double check the accuracy (AI likes to hallucinate) and IP. AI speeds you up, significantly, but it doesn’t do the job for you.\n14. **KDP plateau.** Plateaus do happen at every stage. I sat at a bit over $6,000 per month for a while, luckily for me it was a decent enough revenue to stay motivated. Some people, especially beginners, plateau at $0 per month, or they reach $500 in the first months, stall for a few months, assume “KDP is dead” and quit. It’s not. It’s just lag and learning. The move isn’t to quit, it’s to keep publishing and keep making small improvements. Eventually you’ll break out. Keep going, keep measuring, keep improving and then the compounding finally shows up.\n15. **Outsourcing and delegating.** All of this is going to depend on your budget and skill level. I hire people to go faster, not to disappear. I keep strategy, ads, research, final approval and hand off stuff like covers, interiors, basic edits, videos. I also do some books fully myself to keep improving and learning. At first you should do everything yourself, to learn as much as possible, to even know what to ask your employees to do, to be able to make SOPs for them. Eventually when you can no longer keep up with the amount of books you want to make, you start hiring. Track cost per title, have an idea on how fast the contractors work, how long it is going to take to make a book. Keep light P M Cadence, do weekly check-ins, have a QC checklist before anything goes live. Plan so that one person’s vacation doesn’t stall launches. Pay on time, give bonuses when earned, give specific feedback, promote your A-players.\n16. **Treat it like a real business and I mean REAL business.** KDP isn’t a lottery ticket, it’s a real publishing business. I budget, track unit economics and make decisions off numbers, not vibes. That means knowing your CTR/CVR, ACOS/TACOS, margin, payback time (how long till the book repays it’s investment), opportunity cost, LTV per title and more. Keep a simple P&amp;L, reinvest into ads, books, testing, learning. Write SOPs for contractors, kill or fix anything that doesn’t earn its shelf space. Manage your cashflow, plan for seasonality, keep runway for tests, don’t starve the winners. Be boringly safe on ToS/IP and make sure to set aside money for taxes. Real business = clear goals, clean and tight processes, consistent iteration.\n17. **You need action much more than you need information.** Most people don’t have a knowledge problem, they have a doing problem. You can binge every KDP video, read every post in KDP forums and still have $0 in royalties because you never uploaded anything. On top of that you’re gonna forget most of the stuff you watched either way if you do not try to implement it almost immediately. When and if you’ll start taking action, you’ll go back and start rewatching those videos again with context. Learn just enough to take action. By taking action you’ll learn the most. Half baked action beats perfect research because market teaches faster than any tutorial. Most importantly be consistent with your action, and consistently improve with it.\n\n# Key Takeaways\n\nKDP is not oversaturated. People said that it was already “too late” back in 2019 when I first started, and they’ll say the same in 2030. The real difference is how you treat KDP. Treat it like a real business. Track data. Build Systems. Reinvest Profits. TEST RELENTLESSLY. Be consistent and improve every week. Stagnation is death, and even to maintain your level, you have to keep evolving because the competition is evolving. Plan your week. Every Sunday, I write down my tasks and deadlines. And I need to do them. No excuses. That habit alone kept me on track for 60-70 hours a week for over a year.\n\n# My Goals for the Future\n\nThis December my plan is to get to $100,000 - the coveted six figure month. I know it’s possible, because December sales can triple or quadruple.  \nBut my goals don’t stop here.\n\n**My next milestone for 2026:**  \n$1,000,000 in total revenue  \n$253k+ in December 2026 alone.  \nThe reason for that specific figure is that back in 2020 I spoke with someone who made $252K in December 2019 with a team consisting of her and her husband. I’m going to have a bigger team than that to try to hit this number, but let’s ignore that fact.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis year has been life-changing. I went from being broke and sleeping in my car to running a six figure publishing business. I don’t think that this was luck. It was consistency, constant improvement, and treating KDP like the serious business it is. If you’re reading this and were thinking about quitting. DON’T. Keep going, test things, learn from your data, stay disciplined. Do not think “What if it’s not going work out? What if I fail?”. Think “What if everything does work out?”.",

The problem is I do not have the time or energy for a second full time job.\n\nI am not great at big business ideas. The only thing I can imagine is something small online, like selling a few simple products or a tiny ecommerce page. A friend told me I should not overthink it and just put up a very simple site first, using one of those one sentence website tools like genstore to get the basic store in place, then slowly fix the text and layout later. It sounds nice in theory, but I am not sure if I am just running away from learning real skills.\n\nIf you only had one or two hours a day and a goal like “just make 20 extra dollars,” would you spend that time learning more skills, or would you push out a tiny store as fast as possible and see what happens I would really like to hear from people who used a very small side project to pay off debt or at least make it less scary.",

Most of them either paid basically nothing or took forever to see any results. I kept jumping from idea to idea because everyone online makes it look so easy, but when you actually try it, it’s a whole different story. Being a student doesn’t help either, I barely have time and I’m always broke, so I needed something that actually works without a bunch of start-up costs.\nAfter trying all that stuff, only a few things ended up giving me real payouts. Making short little brand videos on Methods app has been surprisingly decent, I’m not some influencer or anything, but the beginner tasks still pay something. I also started putting simple digital templates on Etsy, and I sell small guides and checklists on Gumroad whenever I have time to make new ones. And when I need quick tiny cash, KashKick fills in the gaps, even if it’s not a lot. These aren’t huge money makers, but when you stack them together, it’s actually helped me get through the last couple months.\nI’m still learning and trying things though, because I kinda need every extra dollar I can get right now. If anyone else is also doing low-effort or beginner-friendly online stuff that pays even a little, I’d love to hear what’s been working for you. I’m really just trying to survive school without going completely broke lol.",

Any time you see anyone advertising or doing anything.  Ask yourself, why are they doing that, how does that work, how hard is it to do that exact thing?  Talk to real people you know.  Chances are they like you and will tell you what they’re up to.  All those people living around you in a big city…they’re all making money…and it’s not just a full-time job.  Be observant.  And once people find a profitable side hustle, the last thing they want are copycats so they do not post it online.  But it does take imagination, brainpower and often learning new skills.  Just don’t let your brain hold you back.  Never let your brain tell you that you could never do that for whatever reason.  With all the free learning tools out there these days there’s literally nothing that you can’t figure out.  If you see an AD online that says ‘Make Money Easy Online’.  Don’t fall for it.  The person posting that AD is the only one making money.  You can try copying what they’re doing if you want.  But don’t buy what they’re trying to sell.",

And while you have a real job, you practice safe common investing and you look for a really in-demand good or service you can provide better than most (e.g. you can give people specific travel advice for their specific needs, you can make available some miracle remedy to a specific health issue found in some overseas country Westerners don't know about, you can tutor people for a valuable and difficult professional exam). All rich people are rich because they were handed it, were one of the very very few people to gamble successfully, stole it, got a very good job that paid lavishly and did some safe investing, or finally found their something to provide. Almost no one gets rich by just random grifting here and there on whatever the Internet claims to be the new gold.",

Things like cleaning services, pet care, or mobile car detailing can work really well in the UK market.. lower overhead than retail and you can often start small and scale up.\n\nThe property thing - yeah i get why you're hesitant there. But service businesses are different because you're not tied to expensive real estate. One thing I'd suggest is looking at businesses where you can test the concept first before going all in. Like if you're thinking about a cleaning franchise, maybe try running a small independent version for a few months to see if you even like managing crews and dealing with customers. That way your £10k goes toward actually validating the idea instead of just jumping in blind.",

You don’t need VC money, a team, or years of coding experience anymore.\n\nHere’s the formula:\n\nFind a problem you’ve personally experienced, something annoying that costs you time or energy, and build a solution around that inside of Lovable. It’ll handle all the SaaS boilerplate for you, so you can focus on the actual product. Use Supabase for your backend and Stripe for payments. That’s your foundation sorted.\n\nNow when it comes to marketing, this is where most people go wrong. The first 30 days should be 100% organic. That looks like:\n\n1. Reddit posts that don’t feel like plugs. Ask questions or share your story in communities related to your niche. Don’t sell, just spark discussion.\n\n2. Reddit replies under competitor mentions. Add real value to existing threads; people will click through naturally.\n\n3. YouTube comment placements. Leave thoughtful comments under videos where your target users hang out.\n\n4. Short-form videos. Post simple slideshows or product demos daily on TikTok, Reels, and Shorts, like “top 5 controversial things I learnt about XYZ” \n\n5. AI UGC videos. Use an avatar or voiceover to share your product demo with a catchy hook like “Can’t believe this tool does X.”\n\n6. Green screen memes. “POV: you realised [pain your product solves]” it’s quick, relatable, viral.\n\n7. Standing avatar + wall of text. Static background, emotional or relatable text overlay; crazy watch time, easy to make.\n\nThese plays can bring your first 100 users without spending a cent on ads. Stack them daily, and you’ll start building real momentum fast.\n\nBtw you can run these marketing strategies inside something like Canva or Aftermark AI ",

          "body": "I grew up in a similar family. Don't discuss with them any work you're doing to improve your situation. That's going to be hard if you don't have a support system outside of your home, but you have to expect that there will be attempts to sabotage anything you're doing to improve yourself and remove the amount of control they have over your life right now. Do what you can to find some real friends in your area to connect with. Start slowly leaving the house more often. Have a friend teach you how to drive until you can get your license, without telling your family. I'm assuming they wouldn't let you borrow their car to use on your driving test. Idk if there are driving schools in your area that can help with that or if a friend will let you use theirs. Where I live you have to provide a car to drive for the road test when getting your license.\n\nPeople don't understand that if you don't have money, can't drive legally, and don't have a support system, it's not as easy as just leaving. Leave and go where? Any skills you start learning, keep it to yourself as much as possible. Any money you start saving up, keep it a secret. If your family is using you as their free caregiver and servant, you have to expect that upsetting the status quo is going to upset them and that they'll do their best to stop it. When I was 19, I had to move out of state before I could get control over my life and money finally. It got to the point where my parents started using the money I made at my job and set aside for my tuition and savings towards moving out for fun gifts for themselves. There's a huge difference between being ungrateful and being in a highly controlling and abusive home where your parents aren't allowing you to lead an independent life or learn the skills you need in order to do that. Good luck to you.",

Everyone needs an calender. If not that try selling some feet pics. I no its weird but the people that buy them or used underwear are weirder but no judging. Not like I wear them only sniff them is all. Cough cough. Or how about becoming a massage person that goes house to house rubbing down rich people dogs and cats? Or you can put up Christmas lights for 1000 a house in nicer neighborhoods and charge half that to take them down?  Or some people need a fake date to go places. Have people hire you as a friend or fake gf or bf for dates with the family?",

          "body": "In today’s world, financial pressure on young adults is undeniable. The rising cost of education, housing, and general living expenses, combined with the desire for financial independence, has made a single source of income feel insufficient. Fortunately, the modern economy, powered by technology and connectivity, has opened up countless opportunities to earn extra money. For young adults, this \"side hustle\" culture isn't just a trend; it's a practical way to build savings, pay down debt, or simply afford a better quality of life. The methods available are vast, ranging from flexible app-based gigs to monetizing unique personal skills online.\nThe most accessible entry point for many is the gig economy. This term refers to the ecosystem of apps and platforms that connect workers directly with customers for short-term, on-demand jobs. Think of services like Uber and Lyft for ridesharing, or DoorDash, Instacart, and Uber Eats for food and grocery delivery. These jobs are popular for a reason: the barrier to entry is low, and the scheduling is incredibly flexible, allowing you to work around classes or another job. Beyond delivery, platforms like Rover and Wag connect animal lovers with pet-sitting and dog-walking gigs, while TaskRabbit allows you to get paid for helping people with moving, furniture assembly, or yard work. While this work provides immediate income, it can be inconsistent and is often tied to your location and the time you're willing to put in.\nFor those with specific digital skills, the world of online freelancing offers a path to higher-paying and more career-focused work. Young adults, often \"digital natives,\" are uniquely positioned to excel here. Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr have created global marketplaces where you can sell your talents. If you are a strong writer, you can get paid for writing blog posts, website copy, or social media updates. If you have an eye for design, you can create logos, social media graphics, or presentations for businesses. Other in-demand skills include video editing, programming, and even administrative tasks as a \"virtual assistant,\" helping busy professionals manage their email and schedules from afar. This route not only provides income but also builds a professional portfolio, which can be invaluable for your future career.\nIf you have a more entrepreneurial or creative spirit, you might explore the creator and e-commerce economy. This involves building a brand or business online. One popular path is e-commerce, which can be as simple as \"thrifting\" or finding unique clothing and reselling it on platforms like Depop, Poshmark, or eBay. If you are crafty, you can open an Etsy shop to sell handmade goods, art, or even digital products like resume templates, photo-editing presets, or planners. On the creator side, platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch allow you to build an audience around a passion, whether it's gaming, cooking, or education. While it is a slow process, a dedicated following can be monetized through ad revenue, brand sponsorships, and selling merchandise. This path requires patience and consistency, as you are building an asset, not just trading time for money.\nFinally, it’s important not to overlook the power of traditional, local services. Not every side hustle has to be high-tech. There is always a reliable demand for in-person skills. If you excel in a particular subject, academic or music tutoring is a classic and well-paying option. Babysitting and nannying remain in high demand, offering steady, reliable income. Other valuable local services include house cleaning, landscaping, car washing, or offering tech support to less tech-savvy neighbors, like helping seniors set up their smartphones or computers. These jobs often pay in cash and help you build a strong reputation within your community, leading to consistent work through word-of-mouth referrals.\nUltimately, the best method for earning extra money depends entirely on your personal skills, available time, and financial goals. The gig economy offers speed and flexibility, while freelancing builds a valuable portfolio. E-commerce and content creation provide a path to building your own brand, and local services offer reliable, community-based income. The key is to recognize that your time and skills have value. By exploring these options, you can move beyond relying on a single paycheck and take active control of your financial future.",

      "selftext": "Major info from my last post first- (Posted 2 months ago)\n\n—-\n\nSo I got to know I have a severe heart condition in January that needed an urgent procedure to happen in order for me to live. I got it done, lots of paranoia and a long recovery made me try out a few major online side hustles as I took a long break from my job. Here’s what worked for me and can work for you too!\n\nActual Book Publishing (Amazon KDP)-  So writing has been my passion since a long time and I had this fairytale story written from like the past 2 years, so I gave it a try and published it with a nice cover and a little self done social media marketing it cost me $500 total to format it, cover artists and some social media posts. It’s earning 100$/month since! I have another book planned but won’t publish it until next year.\n\nNext was Ebooks, simply taking a burning issue or a very niche idea and creating a how to guide (purely Chatgpt) but NOT AI SLOP! Something that has value and people use it. I made 2 books and felt it was a bit boring for me, it costed me 100$/book and I made like 20$ from each till now. This literally has a huge potential if done properly and genuinely you can make 10-15 books a month, even if 1 blows up you are set for life!\n\nFacebook Pages- So a little background, in the place I worked I used to manage a lot of pages like this (this was pre facebook monetisation era) but as FB started monetising content even pictures and text posts, It became a full blown business! As I was off from work I focused on one page of my own and grew it to almost 100k followers in 6 months (it had 10k in Jan)\n\nThis page earns me almost $1000, every month since March and it’s only increasing. The only thing I do is make 5 posts a day, literal photos and maybe some graphics like quote posters every once in a while.\n\nYouTube - This has been my favourite! So there’s a very good niche of explainer videos that you must have seen! It’s just simply explaining stuff that’s interesting. It maybe sports, Entertainment, movies, science, money anything! I myself preferred motorsports so I went with that! This month is my 3rd month being monetised and I earned around $3000 till today (I started in July End, monetised in Sep 1st Week) This thing helped me find potential people who wanted to do the same thing and as I recruited a lot of video editors for myself I asked them to work with me with a few bucks overcharge (If I pay 50 for a 15 min video I ask $60) and this helped me earn a $200 from my first client.\n\nSo yeah! That’s pretty much it, I will be uploading proofs in comments if People want, I just wanted to post this and let people know that there is always light at the end of the tunnel and if you are willing to work and maybe spend a little money, the universe has a great way of returning it in multiple folds!\n\nNow Update- (I have helped 3 people who are doing Facebook, 2 are doing Youtube with me) Now the monthly earnings are increasing to almost $3k in profits (1k from facebook, $2k from YouTube, around $100 from books)\n\nAlso, I am walking regularly now… little steps… I know but We will get there soon! \n\nSo ama I guess, I will try to help out as many people as I can, just like last time :)",

          "body": "A decent side hustle I've been doing is looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than any initial cost. It's a form of arbitrage, and it can make you an extra couple hundred each month. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives those offers higher, creating more opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how it works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

Bought 2 pairs nobody wanted. Sold 1 at a loss. Net: –$142.\n\nAir fryer recipes on TikTok - Posted daily for a month. Got 3k views total. One dude commented \"mid.\" Earned $0.\n\nDigital planners - Spent $70 on \"premium fonts.\" Sold 0. My cousin downloaded the sample for free and never said thanks.\n\nSurvey apps - 40 minutes for $1.20. Deleted all of them out of self-respect.\n\n**What actually paid (tiny but real):**\n\nPhone repair gigs - Replaced cracked screens. Charged $40–$60 each. Made \\~$260 after buying tools.\n\nCleaning two Airbnbs - Found on Facebook groups. $55 per clean, did 5 in two months. Total: $275 and a sore back.\n\nTask Monkey (Chrome extension) - Tried it during Prime Day. Got $82 back from random Amazon price drops with zero effort. Literally the closest thing to \"passive\" I touched.\n\n5 months in, I don't trust the \"make money in your sleep\" people.\n\nEverything that paid required sweat, messages, or driving across town.\n\nThe \"passive\" stuff? Mostly vibes and disappointment.\n\nIf you've found something real that isn't a course, a flip, I'm listening.",

It's getting paid to post on social media and chat with people sometimes.\n\nUGC is not passive but, you can make $50 to $250 per video for brands. There's a sub here that posts gigs.

It could be a passive income if you have a trusted manager you pay to oversee 20 vending machines while you’re still collecting a decent profit after expenses.\n\nSame thing applies for Airbnb cleanings, if you hire enough employees and managers to run it for you.\n\nAnother example is owning rental units.\n\nAnother example without owning actual business are owning stock and getting paid dividends, becoming an angel investor for someone with a great idea, silent investors, creating enough videos that generate views consistently.\n\nOnce you fully understand what passive income is and how to approach it, you can really take any endeavor and grow it to where you can step away and generate true passive income. Many endeavors require the business to be much larger to generate passive income so you don’t have to work again but you could still generate something small on the side if you want.",

At least they are out there if people search em I guess. \n\nI did surveys and because I’m such an honest person I felt bad lying about anything that was too personal and usually u waste ur time on them just for them to say nah we don’t want you.

Had to switch to using Powerade powder as it is. \n\nThe most passive thing I do tho is using American Express points for credit on my bill. So I run every single daily expense for the household thru the card. Put the cash into an account and pay when I need to. This gives me a couple cents of interest sometimes and every 10,000 points = $50.

Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

It’s beginner friendly and doesn’t require big upfront costs.\n\nAnother underrated one is doing **s**hort marketing videos for small businesses. Every business needs content for Instagram and TikTok, but most don’t know how to make it or don’t have time. You can create these videos using stock footage, simple templates, and AI voice tools. The hardest part used to be the voiceover, but that is solved easily now with modern tools.

Don't know how this will work, but it's an idea.\n\nIn 2018, I helped do a journalism piece on modern slavery  for the show Ecologic on 99.5 WBAI Radio, NYC. I was researching for slavery in the palm oil industry, their enslavement  of people and environmental degradation from the plantations, but when you research,  you find other stuff. One of them was fake designer bags. They force slaves to make the bags with lead. The buyer slowly dies of lead poisoning because the dust is either inhaled,  absorbed through skin, or if you're a nail biter, through the mouth. The slaves can be children of hide and seek age. I had nightmares doing this story.\n\nSo, keeping stuff out of the landfill,  making designer goods cheap enough to compete with fakes, while helping the slaves and giving me pocket money  might be the answer to solve a horrific problem. Still learning how to do this , but there are bag flippers out there making a living. Might as well try.",

Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

My blog has made about $6000 this year, and I didn't post a single thing all year, that is just passive income from all the work I did on the website over the prior few years.\n\nI always hoped to build the site to the point where I could make full-time income off it, so to me $6k over 11 months really sucks. It made $9000 the previous year. And it took years just to get to that point. But when I think about the fact it's fully passive, that makes me feel a bit prouder lol. Who knows how much I might have made if I was still actively posting this year, and keeping my affiliate links updated (my main affiliate switched platforms and the task of updating all those links was too much, I still haven't finished). I got discouraged by all the AI plagiarism ripping my shit off and started a new job that left less time for the hobby.",

I’ve built relationships with people in my network that I know manages warehouses and most time I get the pallets for cheap (less than a $1) and sell them to pallet company’s for $4 who recycles it and sells it back for $7.

          "body": "You can try bonus arbitrage, which can probably make you a couple hundred each month. Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

I'm an e-commerce seller myself, I started off with nothing but through collaborations with suppliers, I was able to build my firm to rake in thousands of sales per day. Ofc it took time, but I started off with nothing. Likewise, you can start exploring your niche of your interests, make a plan, start off with the lowest investment or collaborations if possible. I wouldn't say ecommerce, I meant anything, wherever your interest or expertise lay.\n\nRemember, everyone has their lowest phase of life, and its never permanent.

I was just a mum trying to make things a bit easier… and hoping something would finally work.\n\nIt ended up being one of the best choices I’ve ever made.\nIt’s flexible around the kids, the community is unbelievably supportive, and I’ve never felt like I’m doing it alone. People actually help you. They don’t judge you for having bad days or juggling life.\n\nIf you ever want to take a quiet look, you can message me on Facebook, I’m Char Armitage.\nNo pressure. I won’t chase you or dump messages on you. I’ll simply invite you into the community so you can read through things when you get a moment.\nIf it feels right, amazing.\nIf it doesn’t, that’s completely fine too.\n\nWhen you’re struggling, sometimes you just need something that gives you hope again… this did that for me. And if it can do that for someone else, I’m happy to share it. 💛",

Dollar-cost averaging beats market timing - You invest the same amount regularly, regardless of market conditions. When prices are high, you buy fewer shares. When prices are low, you buy more. Over time, this averages out your purchase price and removes emotional decision-making.  \n  \n2. Low-cost index funds beat active management - Over 90% of active fund managers underperform the market over 15+ years (check the SPIVA scorecards yourself). Index funds track the entire market with fees around 0.1-0.3% annually instead of 1-2%+ for active funds. That difference compounds massively.  \n  \n3. Time in market beats timing the market - Historical data shows staying invested through crashes outperforms trying to predict them. The market has always recovered. Always.",

I found an MRR course that teaches digital marketing fundamentals (if you’re unfamiliar with MRR, I can resell the course and keep 100% of the profit).\n\nOnce I set up the funnel and automated some of the marketing, it mostly just runs in the background, aside from pre-planned posts on a faceless Instagram page. \nPeople buy the course, I keep the full payment, and I don’t have to create content from scratch or deal with customer support for the actual course material.\n\nIt’s not “get rich quick” or anything, but it’s way more passive than client work or one-off gigs. The hardest part is just getting the initial traffic/audience going, but once that’s rolling it’s pretty hands-off.\n\nAnyone else doing something similar with digital products?",

For the first month I targeted 20% of my deposit per day. If I profited anything more, then that’s a bonus at the end of the month. As the months went on I targeted a smaller percentage per day. \n\nI initially deposited $10 and at the end of the 12 months my account was standing on $924,66. This was just strictly based off what my targets were. There were a few days where I hit a stop loss but, keeping a simple risk strategy is going to be a key to success. \n\n\nWhere people end up messing up, is that they try to 5x their deposits within a day. Which doesn’t work. \n\nRather slow and steady, than try and rush to make a million overnight. ",

Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them.

You have to commit yourself against any kind of fun for a while, but eventually your mind changes and it gets easier.\n\nYou’ll see friends going to bars, clubs, fun, and festivals. Some won’t talk with you anymore because you can’t do what they are. you’ll miss trips, you won’t take vacation, you’ll not get kids important to you the exact thing you wanted. You’ll be embarrassed. You’ll have to eat the free lunch anytime it’s available. You’ll need to not eat out, clip coupons, make your own coffee, not get a convenient snack at the gas station. You have to be a little hungry til you’re home. Going somewhere for fun? It’s the park with your feet.\n\nYou’ll do this for a minimum of three years, and the rest of the world will be having a WAY better time.\n\nYear one starts slow. Agonizing. It’s $10 to a broker account a week. Maybe $50 if things went alright. Your friends are hitting you up but you’re not going. Month goes by. You’re suddenly craving your favorite Chinese spot, and damn you have $200 extra, can’t you slide some over? NO. You can’t. Because you looked up some monthly dividend-payers and that $200 is about to pay you $5. That Amazon movie you want to see is $4.99, perfect! FUCK NO.\n\nYou’re 6 months in, damn, you were able to save a grand, where did that come from? You can afford a little splurge, right? There’s a charter that’s $180 to take you fishing and you just got paid - why don’t you go? Well now your $5 dividend-paying stock that cost you $200 had some NAV erosion and it’s $185. You make the painful smart choice to buy another. Single. Stock. Because now you’re making another whole $5 this month and it was $15 off.\n\nAbout this point you realize how expensive it is to actually buy your own time back. So you start running the numbers. You want $10/hr? Congrats you have now accumulated around $1400 in your $5 dividend-paying account spread across 7 total stocks. You have bought yourself 3.5 hours of work at $10/hr.\n\nYou realize no one can live on $10/hr without support, and life really wants around $25-30.\n\nYou really only gained an hour, it’s November. Christmas is coming, last Christmas sucked, you have over a grand, your partner is upset you’re not living like everyone else… but you *did* get an extra hour of work out of every month.\n\nNext year, you try harder, you get a second job. You diversify. You find there are weekly payers. You get them for a quick dopamine hit. it’s good for a bit to see that cash every week. Then someone on TV says something they don’t mean and your portfolio tumbles, you stopped your steady $5/month payer and had it all in weekly payers, you got greedy and didn’t know what you were buying, so you cash out, taking a little tax hit and bruising your ego. You’re kicking yourself, you don’t want to tell your partner you just set yourself back two months.\n\nJust then, new tech! Your weeklies raise and you’re already out. You want back but you know better, and two weeks later, you were glad you didn’t buy the news, it’s crashed even lower.\n\nYou feel smart, but you couldn’t have really known though. You’re more uncertain, your money is in the hands of billionaires through your broker. They don’t give a shit about you. They could wipe your account at any time (it’s in the terms but you didn’t read them at first).\n\nYou start to realize you need custody, that is your money. You learn about Direct Registration, where shares are ACTUALLY held in your name - under your SSN, not a broker. We’re rolling up on the third year here….\n\nYou now own your shares.

You bought 3-4 hours of your time back and it only took 3 years! \n\nNow everything looks different. You don’t go to the weed shop and get two cartridges, you don’t smoke at all because that’s cutting into paying yourself faster. You’ve actually dropped a few habits because they were expensive.\n\nAll your friends are broke and complaining, you’re just quiet because you stacked - but you’re still not done… because in just a few months you’re on your way to $185 a month in dividends, which you’re putting right towards those nice stocks that always hang around $180, and FINALLY you’re getting some compounding.\n\nAnd you still can’t spend that because God only knows what’s around the corner.\n\nIt can be done, it’s FUCKING HARD.\n\nI don’t do much in stocks anymore, I took a good chunk of what I made (except long term plays) and mine Bitcoin now, but you didn’t want promotion, so there’s a stock story.",

          "body": "OP, if you want passive you can simply invest in an index fund. But in general, passive is relative. Let me explain why real estate to me—despite the work—is passive. \n\nFirst, real estate can be allot of work for short bursts. You research, find, negotiate a deal. You spend a month or two fixing it up after your normal job’s workday (which I actually find fun bc it is grounding and I live in my head too much with my job).   Then you rent it out. Yes a/c’s break. Roofs leak. Plumbing gets backed up. Often at inconvenient times. \n\nBut partly what makes those repairs a pain is that for the most part for months at a time, you’re not doing anything to or for a property. It actually is so passive it makes you lazy.  Then at the height of your comfort or laziness, a toilet backs up. Big deal, you call a plumber or you try to fix it yourself. \n\nAnyway, just want to point out that work you like doing is itself sort of passive. So be sure to search for that too…",

You can buy them for as low as $100 and they were at 5% so you would get $5 a year for every $100 you put in.  \n\nSo to get your $600-$2,400 a year it would take $12,000-$48,000 and bam you got it.  Also it's state and local tax free. \n\nAn easer goal would be to get $100 a year in passive income and build from there.  I would recommend researching dividend stocks.\n\nMy real story:  I started with the goal of reaching $100 in passive income starting in June or July.  I started posting to my YouTube to try to get monetized and that didn't work.  So then I talked with my friend about what do rich people do? He said stocks and bonds.  Neither of us actually knew how to buy stocks or bonds so I went on YouTube and did my research.  I opened up a brokerage account and started putting in like $50 a week and buying Coke (KO) and Verizon (VZ) because that's what Warren Buffet did.  I ended up not making $100 by the end of the year.  \n\nHowever now I had a start and knew what to do.  So my goal for the next year was to make $400 in dividends and I ended up making a little over $400.  The next year goal was to make $700 and I ended up making a little over $1,000.  So that brings us to this year with the goal of around $2,000 (it's now more a share number) and it looks like I will maybe make it.  I have collected about $1,800 so far this year.  It gets a lot easer after the second year and you can see the progress.  It will take years to build up to something substantial and take you putting a large % of your income into it every payday.",

It's a form of arbitrage, and it can make you an extra couple hundred each month. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives those offers higher, creating more opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how it works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them.

I credit card and bank bonus churn at least twice per year also, which can usually get $300 to $500 annually in bonuses. \n\nThere's some [money making apps](https://www.thebudgetdiet.com/apps-that-pay-you-real-money-instantly) I use also while watching TV or chilling around the house. I'll answer surveys with Branded Surveys, and I've been using some passive apps too like MobileXpression. Have started doing market research with User Interviews also (this is my new favorite).\n\nOn the save money side, I basically eat the same few recipes now for every meal. This helps keep groceries down and more simple to budget/plan for. I also use a cash-back credit card, shop for specials, and use in-store loyalty program.\n\nI haven't found that one single side hustle covers everything.

If you write a book then you’re a writer. If you’re a social media influencer then you’re an entertainer.  \n\nI would argue that just because something provides residual income doesn’t make it passive, and many things still require pretty significant upkeep even after they’re “launched.”  \n\nAs others have said, traditional investments like stocks, dividends, and CDs are truly the most passive thing I can think of, but that of course requires a nest egg of money to start with. \n\nThat being said, it’s much easier to make money from a regular job and then dump it into a stable dividend stock than it is to learn how to write a book or an app if you don’t have any experience with that sort of thing.",

Most online income streams require some level of updating just to stay relevant because the internet moves fast and competition is nonstop. You can build systems that feels passive, like digital products, affiliate links, or automated funnels, but they still need tweaks to keep performing. The truth is most “passive income” is really front-loaded work with occasional maintenance, not total hands-off money. It’s possible, but definitely closer to semi-active for most people.",

Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

          "body": "You can try bonus arbitrage, which can probably make you a couple hundred each month. Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

          "body": "So here’s the honest truth:\n\nYou CAN start without spending a dime.  Just creating and promoting a product yourself.  But I will say very few people have success starting it this was because they have no plan or idea how to market it and people want to buy something that has already proven to sell - not something brand new.  \n\nWith that being said - most people start out purchasing a course that teaches them everything about the space and how to get started and gain traction - and that course also has Affliate commission so you make money by selling it to other people.  Which ultimately is worth it because you get rights to resell something that you don’t have to spend a minute of your time creating.  Selling it once and you already almost make your money back. Twice and you’re in the green. \n\nBUT some courses are absolute trash.  I bought an embarrassing amount at this point and only some are worth it so do your research and not just what seems popular. \n\nYou need to go into the mindset that it’s a marathon not a sprint and you’re building something not looking for quick get rich now cash because frankly it’s just not gonna happen. And you’ll burn out real quick.  People saying they made thousands the first week are 99 percent bullshit.  \n\nMy real results is I made absolutely zero for 4 months.  Took a break. Restarted and finally seeing some traction. My best month was just under 2k. But again that’s not my average.  Just being totally transparent.  Can it be my average eventually? Forrrr sure.  But I own a husiness and have 2 kids LOL. So ultimately time spent working on your sales and growth is absolutely directly related to how much success you see.    It’s not passive by any means at first - maybe never IDK. But I do know the potential is absolutely unreal.",

The process is very straightforward. Start by choosing a good niche. Animals are always a reliable option. Gather a collection of images online, then use a conversion website to turn them into clean line art. You can bundle these designs and sell them on Etsy or in Facebook groups.\n\nOffering custom work can be even more profitable. You can convert customers’ personal photos into line art for a higher fee. The site I use costs about ten cents per conversion, and you can charge a few dollars for premade bundles or five to fifteen dollars for custom conversions.\n\nYou can also do seasonal images like a bunch of different characters for Xmas for example",

I personally have 4 savings set out for me. \nSavings 1 - 6 months expenses. Eg. Car payments, rent, phone bills, medical aid, etc. This is there to save in any situation where I get fired or retrenched. \nSavings 2 - short term goals. Eg. I just started adding to this monthly. No real goal, just kept saving here. \nSavings 3 - emergency savings. In any situation you could get to a point where you need to pay for something that you can’t afford cash. \nSavings 4 - long term goals. Eg. Marriage, home loan, car loan, etc. where it will be big amounts. \n\nUse these to set yourself up. You’re young, you can do it. \n\nIf you want side hustles, monitor TikTok trends and see how many people are doing it. I have many side hustles that do quite well.

You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

I can't choose the project, only have the blue button of \"Start grading\" and this opens now Onyx tasks, so I can't work on Polly now.\n\n2.

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I posted this in another subreddit and I got some heartwarming messages that it inspired them, so I'm going to share this with you, hopefully it can inspire some of you as well. (I don't have anything to sell, don't worry.)\n\nI’ve been doing Amazon KDP (Amazon's self publishing platform) since August of 2024, a little over a year now. It is possible to do it on the side, I didn't because I started with nothing. Literally. No money, living out of my car, and I needed to do something about my situation. I want to share my full experience scaling this from $0 to $150K revenue. The lessons I learned, and why I think KDP is nowhere near saturated as many claim.\n\nMy hope is that this post will give you value, motivation, and perspective, especially if you’re just starting out or feel stuck.\n\n# A Little Background\n\nI’ve always been into business, ever since i was a kid flipping Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh cards and other collectibles, plus video game currencies, items, accounts. Over the years I’ve tried everything: forex, stock trading, affiliate marketing, SEO blogs, dropshipping, customer acquisition/lead generation agency, CPA marketing, SMMA, POD, and of course KDP.\n\nJust to keep in mind, this is not my first time doing KDP. My first attempt was in 2019, but my account got banned in early 2020 for a few (frustrating) reasons:\n\n* I used a term, that a few months later got filled for trademark and Amazon flagged me, even tho the trademark was just pending and was rejected later.\n* Got hit with a “similar cover” strike ( I should have fought it, probably would have won. Not sure why I didn’t.)\n* Published a book called “Snarky Nurse Coloring Book” with the idea that the book was snarky (snarky quotes), not the nurse. Tt got reported by a brand called Snarky Nurse or something similar.\n\nAfter the third strike, Amazon didn’t let me appeal or explain myself, they kept sending the same generic response that the decision is final and nothing could be done.\n\nAfter all this I didn’t do anything, I got comfortable, had plenty in savings, some other life events happened during covid that I lost any motivation to do anything, until life forced me to start again.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nI’m not smart or special. Many people make much more with KDP than I do. But I’ve failed a lot, learned from my mistakes, and treated this like a real business. What I’ll share is what worked for me. Hopefully you’ll learn something useful from it and get some clarity on how you should approach this business if you decide to give it a shot.\n\n# Quick Stats:\n\n* Started: August 2024.\n* Books Published 148. (1 book every 3 days or so)\n* Total Revenue: \\~$150,000\n* Ad Spend: \\~$16,000\n* Employee Costs: \\~$24,000\n* Tools &amp; Subscriptions: \\~$2,500\n* TikTok Marketing Videos: \\~2,000\n* Profit (before tax): \\~100,000\n\nLast month, I made \\~$32,000 revenue, with \\~$10,000 in expenses.\n\n# Lessons, Tests &amp; Observations:\n\n1. **Quality vs. Quantity.** I’ve seen many YouTubers talk about focusing only on quality and to be honest I don’t fully agree. I started with quantity, not because I believed in mass publishing, but because I wanted data. I uploaded many somewhat decent quality books at first (most didn’t even hit 10 sales) and they helped me to identify which niches and formats had potential. Then I moved to more medium quality books, they took me 2-5 days each, in niches that showed potential and these confirmed the winners. I then outsourced even better versions and that’s where most of my revenue came from (excluding the unicorn). So it’s not quality or quantity, you need both to optimize your business.\n2. **Amazon ads.** I’m a numbers guy, I love data, tracking, testing everything. With amazon ads you obviously get more sales, but you also get an 20-30% bump in the organic sales. Sales boost your BSR, help you rank higher, which gets you more sales, more reviews, and all of this combined, a stronger foundation in the algorithm, making it more difficult for competitors to outrank you. So yes, ads are worth it, even beyond direct ROI. There’s another reason why I find ads even more important than getting sales. To be honest I didn’t even start them with the idea to make money from them directly. As I said, I love data, and amazon unfortunately shows you almost no valuable data at all. Running ads helps you a little bit as you can see the impressions you get, how many clicks you get and how many conversions, enough signal to see what’s working and what isn’t. It’s not ideal, but this is what we have to deal with when it comes to amazon.\n3. **Keywords.** Always use relevant keywords, leave fields if you don’t have anything relevant to add. I tested adding trending but not relevant keywords on a couple of books that had \\~20 sales a month each. Sales dropped to 4 and 6 the first month and 1 and 0 on the second month. Removing those irrelevant keywords didn’t restore the sales. Only running ads brought them back. Unrelated words hurt your relevance score, which can tank your book entirely\n4. **External ads.** I had some experimentation with meta ads, spend $600 and made \\~$450 above baseline over the next few months (sales doubled the month with the ads being run and slowly fell back to baseline). Still not enough data to fully judge, I’ll test this more, I need to spend at least $10,000 to have at least some opinion about this, and that’s what I’m going to do in the upcoming months.\n5. **A+ Content.** Almost always helps unless it’s really, really bad. I’ve tested many different layouts, worst ones had \\~10% increase in CVR, the best ones increased 80-150%, depending on the niche and design. Either way, it helps.\n6. **Cover Design (not just artsy, its psychology).** After niche selection, cover is the most important factor. People do judge a book by it’s cover If your design isn’t at least as good as top competitors in that niche, your book is gonna sink in the vast ocean that is Amazon. If you can afford it and your design skills aren’t great, I would suggest outsourcing covers to skilled designers. Still, do some of them yourself, to have a better understanding as not all of it is art, it’s more about the psychology of the customer, it is the pitch for your product. (Also the content of the book has to be good enough as well, because negative reviews can kill your book just as easily as bad cover, just a little slower).\n7. **Descriptions.** I’m not sure if I am just bad at writing them, but I never seen a big difference in CVR from it. The only thing that seems to matter in my experience is the formatting. The description still has to be informative and relevant to the book itself, but if it’s done in a big block of text it’s not gonna help. If it is formatted nicely, then I’ve seen 10-30% CVR improvements. The other thing that I’ve noticed is that having a relevant and informative description helps the book rank higher. It happened consistently enough to make me almost sure that Amazon’s algorithm rewards it.\n8. **Low Search Volume Niches (Small Margins Scale Big).** Pretty much every YouTube video I watched about KDP said to target niches that have high search volume of 1000+ at the minimum and ignore every one of them that get less. I often target niches other skip, even less than 500 searches per month. I care more about competitor strength and actual sales. If I feel I have a fighting chance against the competitor in that kind of niche, that has 100-200k BSR, then I’ll attack it. I get it, making books that are going to get 100-200 sales a month isn’t sexy, but over the year they make $1,200-$2,400, and ten, twenty, thirty, one hundred of these adds up to real income.\n9. **E-mail Lists.** These are great but I’ve only managed to make them work in two situations. In my unicorn niche, I built a list of 1,000+ via a variety of freebies. When I launched a supporting book with a release day discount, I emailed the list and got 200+ day one sales. I’m not saying that 20% of the email list converted, but even if 3-4% can create enough sales velocity to push the book up the rankings making it get even more sales and climb even higher up. Second, with my “client” brand (consumable books). We built the list by running promotional ads and in book freebies. After every weekly release, the email goes out and almost consistently gets 100 day one sales, some releases even get 200-300.\n10. **Short-Form Video Marketing.** One day I got bored and thought about trying out something new, I released a book in a very competitive niche(which means lot’s of interested people) and created a TikTok account to make videos for that book. After printing the book and recording a few videos, repurposing them, following trends, changing the hooks , etc., one video hit nearly 1m views. This led to over 2,000 sales in the first week after upload. Since then I’ve uploaded 250+ videos, hired other people to make videos for me and I’ve had a few other viral videos (not as bit as the original one tho).\n11. **Pricing.** Compete on the quality of your book rather than price, if your book is better than competitor’s, price it higher and position it as premium. Low price makes you look cheap, not “affordable”. The pricing is different depending on the niche and type of the book itself, so what I would recommend is to launch around the average competitor price, could be a little higher if you are confident in your book (that’s what I do), or price it just a little below the average. Monitor CVR, if it is solid, then increase the price by $1 and observe, if it gets too big of a hit, reverse the change if it doesn’t keep increasing the price. If the book ranks high, gets steady organic sales and reviews, push premium pricing.\n12. **99% of Gamblers Give Up Before They Hit it Big.** Okay, maybe not in gambling (please don’t). But in business? Mostly true. Most people give up right before they’ve learned enough both from theirs, and other people’s failures to make their business work. There’s plenty of money in almost every business. Imagine a gambler spinning the slots, after 30 failed spins, he hits jackpot. Business it’s similar, keep testing, keep learning, fail, tweak it, try again. Do that 30 times and on attempt 31 it suddenly looks like you “got lucky”(You didn’t. You just didn’t quit.) If you knew that you were 30 failures away from your dream, would you keep going?\n13. AI Tools as Assistants, Not Crutches Do not let AI do all the work for you. You won’t really learn what’s working and the quality will be subpar. People notice that the book was written by AI and leave negative reviews. Use it to brainstorm ideas, rough outlines, keyword ideas that you’re gonna validate, even sketch A+ layouts. Always double check the accuracy (AI likes to hallucinate) and IP. AI speeds you up, significantly, but it doesn’t do the job for you.\n14. **KDP plateau.** Plateaus do happen at every stage. I sat at a bit over $6,000 per month for a while, luckily for me it was a decent enough revenue to stay motivated. Some people, especially beginners, plateau at $0 per month, or they reach $500 in the first months, stall for a few months, assume “KDP is dead” and quit. It’s not. It’s just lag and learning. The move isn’t to quit, it’s to keep publishing and keep making small improvements. Eventually you’ll break out. Keep going, keep measuring, keep improving and then the compounding finally shows up.\n15. **Outsourcing and delegating.** All of this is going to depend on your budget and skill level. I hire people to go faster, not to disappear. I keep strategy, ads, research, final approval and hand off stuff like covers, interiors, basic edits, videos. I also do some books fully myself to keep improving and learning. At first you should do everything yourself, to learn as much as possible, to even know what to ask your employees to do, to be able to make SOPs for them. Eventually when you can no longer keep up with the amount of books you want to make, you start hiring. Track cost per title, have an idea on how fast the contractors work, how long it is going to take to make a book. Keep light P M Cadence, do weekly check-ins, have a QC checklist before anything goes live. Plan so that one person’s vacation doesn’t stall launches. Pay on time, give bonuses when earned, give specific feedback, promote your A-players.\n16. **Treat it like a real business and I mean REAL business.** KDP isn’t a lottery ticket, it’s a real publishing business. I budget, track unit economics and make decisions off numbers, not vibes. That means knowing your CTR/CVR, ACOS/TACOS, margin, payback time (how long till the book repays it’s investment), opportunity cost, LTV per title and more. Keep a simple P&amp;L, reinvest into ads, books, testing, learning. Write SOPs for contractors, kill or fix anything that doesn’t earn its shelf space. Manage your cashflow, plan for seasonality, keep runway for tests, don’t starve the winners. Be boringly safe on ToS/IP and make sure to set aside money for taxes. Real business = clear goals, clean and tight processes, consistent iteration.\n17. **You need action much more than you need information.** Most people don’t have a knowledge problem, they have a doing problem. You can binge every KDP video, read every post in KDP forums and still have $0 in royalties because you never uploaded anything. On top of that you’re gonna forget most of the stuff you watched either way if you do not try to implement it almost immediately. When and if you’ll start taking action, you’ll go back and start rewatching those videos again with context. Learn just enough to take action. By taking action you’ll learn the most. Half baked action beats perfect research because market teaches faster than any tutorial. Most importantly be consistent with your action, and consistently improve with it.\n\n# Key Takeaways\n\nKDP is not oversaturated. People said that it was already “too late” back in 2019 when I first started, and they’ll say the same in 2030. The real difference is how you treat KDP. Treat it like a real business. Track data. Build Systems. Reinvest Profits. TEST RELENTLESSLY. Be consistent and improve every week. Stagnation is death, and even to maintain your level, you have to keep evolving because the competition is evolving. Plan your week. Every Sunday, I write down my tasks and deadlines. And I need to do them. No excuses. That habit alone kept me on track for 60-70 hours a week for over a year.\n\n# My Goals for the Future\n\nThis December my plan is to get to $100,000 - the coveted six figure month. I know it’s possible, because December sales can triple or quadruple.  \nBut my goals don’t stop here.\n\n**My next milestone for 2026:**  \n$1,000,000 in total revenue  \n$253k+ in December 2026 alone.  \nThe reason for that specific figure is that back in 2020 I spoke with someone who made $252K in December 2019 with a team consisting of her and her husband. I’m going to have a bigger team than that to try to hit this number, but let’s ignore that fact.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis year has been life-changing. I went from being broke and sleeping in my car to running a six figure publishing business. I don’t think that this was luck. It was consistency, constant improvement, and treating KDP like the serious business it is. If you’re reading this and were thinking about quitting. DON’T. Keep going, test things, learn from your data, stay disciplined. Do not think “What if it’s not going work out? What if I fail?”. Think “What if everything does work out?”.",

Search volume 10-50 monthly, low competition, high conversion rates. Published 8 posts month one, 12 posts month two, all 1,200-1,800 words focused on specific problems.\n\nMonths 3-4, I wrote long-tail problem posts from validation interviews \"How to validate SaaS idea without building,\" \"Cheapest way to launch SaaS product.\" These ranked fast (2-3 months) because keyword competition was minimal. Conversion rate 8-12% because search intent matched perfectly. Months 5-6, I published case study content turned founder interviews into posts like \"[Founder name]: $0 to $10K in 6 months.\" These got shared naturally, built backlinks organically, provided social proof simultaneously.\n\nThe system: published 2-3 posts weekly with zero skipping, internal linking between related posts, natural product mentions without forced CTAs. Results timeline: months 1-3 had zero traffic, month 4 hit 200 visitors, month 6 reached 1,200 visitors, month 12 at 8,000 visitors, month 18 at 25,000 visitors.

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nAfter a lot of thinking, I’ve made the decision: I’m going all-in on becoming a professional SEO freelancer. My goal is to build a solid income that can comfortably support me and my family. I know this road is long, competitive, and full of late nights, but I’m committing to the 5-year grind to make it happen.\n\nRight now I literally only have a smartphone and internet (no laptop yet). If anyone feels super generous and wants to donate an old laptop, I’d be forever grateful 😂 – but even without it, I’m getting this done no matter what. I’ll figure out mobile workflows, free tools, library computers… whatever it takes.\nThis is officially Day 1.\nI’m hungry, I’m coachable, and I’m ready to outwork everyone.\n\nIf you’re an experienced SEO freelancer or agency owner, I’d genuinely appreciate any advice you’re willing to drop, especially for someone starting from zero with limited resources:\n•Best free/mobile-friendly tools to learn and deliver real work in 2025?\n•How did you land your very first paying client?\n•What skill inside SEO should I hyper-focus on first (technical, content, link building, local, etc.)?\n•Any “I started with nothing” success stories to keep me motivated?\n\nWishing you all massive wins in your own journeys. Let’s goooo!\nThanks in advance for any tips, reality checks, or encouragement.\nOnward! 🚀",

      "selftext": "I’ve been deep-diving into the affiliate space lately and I’m trying to figure out whether this idea has real legs or if I’m chasing something nobody wants.\n\nQuick background: I’m an engineer who’s spent the last few weeks researching how affiliate programs *actually* work for merchants and creators. I went down a pretty big rabbit hole reading Reddit threads, founders’ stories, complaints, success posts, everything I could find. The same pain points kept popping up over and over—on both sides.\n\nFrom the **merchant side**, I kept seeing things like:  \n• “Hard to know which affiliates actually drive incremental revenue.”  \n• “Coupon sites vacuum up commissions on sales we would’ve gotten anyway.”  \n• “Tracking breaks constantly or needs tons of dev work.”  \n• “Refunds and cancellations are a nightmare to reconcile.”  \n• “Fraud and low-quality affiliates make the whole thing feel sketchy.”\n\nFrom the **affiliate side**, it was stuff like:  \n• “Opaque tracking… feels like I’m guessing half the time.”  \n• “Platforms don’t keep creators updated on deals or new offers.”  \n• “Most tools are made for big creators, not smaller ones.”  \n• “Delayed payouts or unclear earnings.”  \n• “Zero support… just drive traffic and hope for the best.”\n\nAfter reading all this, I started wondering:  \n**What would a super simple, drop-in affiliate system look like if it was built in 2025 from scratch?**\n\nSomething like:\n\n* One script added to the site\n* Auto-tracking of clicks + purchases\n* Clear attribution\n* Dead simple dashboard\n* AI-powered fraud detection and refund reconciliation\n* Tools that help creators actually convert, not just blast links\n\nNo huge setup, no custom backend, no clunky legacy stuff.\n\nRight now, I’ve only built a small landing page and waitlist form just to see if there’s real interest before I invest months into this. Absolutely nothing is live and I have no product to sell. Just trying to validate the idea.\n\n**Here’s the prototype landing page if anyone wants to take a look or join the waitlist:**  \n[https://affiliate-platform-e0416.web.app/](https://affiliate-platform-e0416.web.app/)\n\n(I only include this because some subs require you to show what you’re working on. If the link isn’t allowed, mods can remove it, no hard feelings.)\n\nMy actual question for this sub:  \n**If you’re a merchant, creator, or anyone who deals with affiliate programs, would a drop-in system like this actually solve anything for you?**  \nOr are the real problems somewhere else entirely?\n\nHappy to take criticism, suggestions, or “dude don’t build this” feedback too. The whole point is figuring out if this is useful before writing real code.",

It was stressing him out and slowing him down. \n\n\n\nSo I decided to build him an chatbot. Nothing fancy  just something that could actually help him. And, it ended up working way better than I expected. It helped answer customer’s questions and provide recommendations for the menu considering the menu is pretty large. \n\n\n\nAfter doing this, here are the biggest things I learned:\n\n\n\n1. Have confidence in your skills.\n\n\n\nI didn’t even know if I could build a good chatbot until I actually tried it. Sometimes you don’t know you can do something until you actually try.\n\n\n\n2. Know the value you create.\n\n\n\nI realized the bot wasn’t just “answering questions.” It was giving my dad time back. Every minute the bot handled a question was a minute he didn’t have to leave the oven or stop prepping orders. Time saved is value.\n\n\n\n3. Think long term, not one-time.\n\n\n\nInstead of thinking, “let me just build this once,” I realized how useful it would be to refine it over time, improving responses, adding new features, updating menu items, logging common questions, etc. \n\n  \n\n\n4. Learn from others\n\n\n\nMaking a chatbot that actually works is hard. I watched tutorials, learned from devs, etc. That saved me from so much time. There’s always someone who already solved the problem you’re facing.\n\n\n\nYou can build a lot of useful things with agents and chatbots, even for small businesses like my dad’s.\n\n",

Not everyone should be a businessman or businesswoman. But I think it’s much more thrilling, exciting, and rewarding to be able to build your own business and pass it down to your children.

There is no such thing as a person that can't deal with uncertainty, managing money or that needs constant validation - there just are people that can't do that stuff RIGHT NOW, because that's where they are, who they believe they are and who they choose to be in the future.\n\nThe key is personal growth. It sounds cliche because so many wannabe coaches preach it, but it is true. Just imagine who you were as a child. There is very little of that person in you right now. You changed. The only difference is that most of those changes happen by accident, while the most necessary changes must happen by choice.\n\nOnce you decide to change, you have to act. If you want to learn how to deal with uncertainty, well, put yourself in risky situations. Put your money in small caps, buy cripto, start a side hustle. Assess where you fuck up and learn. If you want to learn how to manage money, well, save and try to manage money. Buy courses, read books on the subject. Assess where you fuck up and learn. If you crave external validation, go to therapy and put yourself in situations in which people doubt you. Assess where you fuck up and learn. Every failure in your journey will hurt - some of them will hurt a lot. Assess the pain, learn and move on.\n\nWhere people go wrong is that they listen to their ego and unsuccessful people, let fear take over their decision rationale, fail to take ownership and responsibility and develop a flawed thought process in which they try as hard as possible to seek comfort and avoid pain. That leads to stagnation, frustration and resentment.\n\nGrowth is in failure and pain. Success is what you attain after you become the person who withstood and rose above those challenges.\n\nIn case you are wondering, this isn't some coaching bullshit. I became a much bettern partner after my first wife divorced me, I went to therapy and owned my shit. I became a better professional after 10 years of service in a company that pushed me as far as I could go. I learned how to build a business after blowing up a failed venture and going bankrupt. It all hurt like fucking hell at the time. I went through depression, substance abuse and all that jazz. I had to decide to get better. Things only got better once I put myself in the driver seat of my own life. If I did it, anyone can. I'm just a random dude from a midsized city in a third world country. ",

The point I'm getting at here is, the vast majority of businesses in America are what I call \"micro\" companies. Companies that are anywhere from 5-15+ employees.\n\nSo why is it like this? The reason is very simple. Every  business, is a bunch of micro business that you could do easier and easier. **No matter what skill you have, that you use at a company, is being used as a stand alone company somewhere else.** \n\nWhat do I mean by this? Fine, you have this horrible job at a car dealership. You are a receptionist. You hate it. You want something else. \n\n**Ever heard of Concentrix? They recently did 10 BILLION in revenue by answering phones.** You know there are people, working at companies now, answering phones for less than $15 an hour. \n\nCar dealerships, clean cars, fix cars, sell cars, sell parts. ALL things you can hire people to do for you. My friends company does very well with just a window tint/detail company. Is **he going to be the next Microsoft? Probably not. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE.** You just need to make enough money that you never have to stress about money again. \n\nEntrepreneurship is not brutal. I've never struggled because I planned and followed rules. If you don't have basic money skills, learn! The largest issue I see is people try to start too big. With too big of a vision. Lets vacuum some floors first. Lets clean some windows. Lets cut some grass. Your neighbor always complaining about how dirty the dog is? My friend Sara makes MONEY with her pet grooming company. \n\n**Most of all:**\n\nQuit telling people its hard.\n\nQuit telling people its stressful.\n\nQuit telling people they shouldn't.\n\nQuit telling people they can't do it because YOU couldn't do it. \n\nI HOPE someone on here looks at your post and says F that shit.

      "selftext": "I went down a rabbit hole on a firm called Vy Capital, and the deeper you look, the more surprising it gets. They operate with almost no visibility in the tech world, yet they’ve become one of Elon Musk’s biggest financial backers.\n\nWhat shocked me first was how small they are.\n\nVy runs with only four core investors and roughly twenty people across California, London and Dubai. Even with a team that small, they **manage around fifteen billion dollars and have delivered about twenty-eight per cent annual returns for ten years.**\n\nThe second surprising thing is how concentrated they are. Instead of spraying money across dozens of startups, they built their entire identity around backing Musk early and sticking with him for the long haul.\n\nSome of their biggest moves include:\n\n* Investing in SpaceX when it was valued at $15B (it’s now close to $400B)\n* Putting $700M into the Twitter acquisition\n* Taking large positions in Neuralink and xAI\n\nThere are estimates that more than half of Vy’s portfolio is now tied to companies Musk runs.\n\nThe final thing that stood out is how they think about building a firm. They aren’t trying to scale into a giant institution. They actually told their LPs recently that they won’t raise outside money anymore. After compounding billions, they want to invest their own capital instead, which is extremely rare in venture.\n\nAnd they’re not only focused on the US. They backed companies like Zomato and Urban Company in India, along with firms like Upgrade, Cerebras and Coalition.\n\nWhen you put it all together, Vy feels less like a traditional VC fund and more like a tight, high-trust investment group built around long-term conviction instead of chasing trends. Small team, deep focus, long holding periods and quiet execution.\n\nPretty unusual in today’s tech investment world.",

That's very different from the VC culture of \"growth at all costs,\" where branding is more important than discipline.  \n  \nOf course, the risk is that everyone will focus on one founder.

Vy's early support of SpaceX, $700 million investment in Twitter/X, and increased focus on Neuralink and xAI demonstrate a degree of alignment that is uncommon.

Even when I fucked up, it was MY fuckup to learn from.\n\n\n\nHaving said that,  I also ran out of money and had to close it. I trusted the wrong people with my finances and lost control.

          "body": "Okay. Long rant ahead.\n\nReal wealth is discretionary time. I’ve run my own solo consulting practice for 15 years and here’s the truth most people don’t want to admit.\n\nMost folks hand over their entire life for a paycheck they don’t even like. They stay in jobs that drain them. They stay in marriages that have been dead, sexless, miserable for years - or for the “sake of the children.” One day they’ll  leave once the kids are grown up. They call it “security” while trading away the only thing they can’t earn back.\n\nAnd the punchline is cruel. By the time they finally “can” live, they’ve forgotten how. By the time, its time to retire, 60-70% of your life is OVER. It's the third quarter and you’re exhausted.\n\nWorking for yourself isn’t magic. It’s ownership. Your own wins. Your own screwups. Your own failures. Your life. Most people aren’t trapped by their job. They’re trapped by their tolerance for misery.\n\nFreedom isn’t given. You take it. You build it. You protect it.\n\nThe real failure isn’t the bad job or the clueless boss. **It’s thinking too small**. People dream in inches then wonder why their life feels tight. You don’t escape the rat race by getting a laptop. You escape it by raising your expectations for your own life. You set standards for yourself beyond what anything thinks is normal or rational.\n\nAnd here’s the part nobody teaches. Most people who leave corporate end up with a worse boss. The boss is *you*. And you’re brutal. You don’t trust yourself. You overthink. You worry about being judged. You micromanage your own ambition into dust. You make lousy money.\n\nPeople want to *play* entrepreneur, not *be* one. They want the aesthetic. Not the accountability. Real entrepreneurship is boring, lonely, and occasionally humiliating. It’s also the only path where your life becomes yours.\n\nMost people don’t fail because they lack talent. They fail because they never commit to being the one on the hook.\n\nAnd **finally**. My personal belief. There has NEVER been an easier time in history to earn six figures, even multi six figures, on your own. There may NEVER be a moment like this, ever again. The opportunities are everywhere. The tools are cheap. The playing field is wide open. The barrier to entry is ZERO.\n\nMost people still won’t do it. Not because it’s impossible. But because they don’t believe in themselves enough to try - and they set goals WAY TOO SMALL!",

Building something of your own forces you to face fear, uncertainty, and responsibility but it also gives you back your self respect. You start waking up thinking, at least the pain you feel today is mine, not caused by someon else's ego.\n\nSo I sold my big houses, my Porsches to run my own mental health startup, It was not easy, it was so painful, I just launched it 6 months ago and start seeing customers subscribing to the app and I am trying to scale it to 10k. The cost of doing this was big, I lost friends, my money, my health, my friends but...I am doing what is meaningful by helping others with their mental health.",

Imagine if you graduated high school and you and all your friends only knew how to start businesses, because that's all they taught you in school. You were programmed to take action in the face of uncertainty, didn't understand failure in the traditional sense, and got back into the saddle quickly after each setback.\n\nTo you, being an employee would be quite foreign. Being told when to come into work, when you needed to clock out, or when you could take vacation days --all of that would seem strange to you. Instead, you spend your days building systems, testing things, and strategizing with people in the market to advance your goals. You pave your own way, make allies along the way and define when to start and when to rest and ultimately what success is for you.\n\nThat's basically how it feels like.",

Initially, I did feel exhilarated and like I was tasting the freedom that I think you're longing for. But it didn't take long for me to realize that I was ignorant about a lot of things and deluding myself into thinking that I had all the answers. I was the clueless one.\n\nMy life is great now, but there were several points along the way where I found myself wondering what life would have been like if a more humble me in the past would have asked different questions and looked more skeptically at the grass on both sides of the fence before jumping. Personally, I also needed a lot more therapy and maturity. Starting my own company nearly cost me my marriage and even my life.\n\nI hope you find the next step in your journey soon and that it's a peaceful transition. I don't think that it should have to be an either/or situation, Corporate vs freelance/small business owner. I think you can work in corporate America and still be happy. I also know from other entrepreneurs' stories that you can do your own thing and be utterly miserable. It might be time for you to make the leap, but I'd recommend honing your side hustle skills first and checking out what other opportunities are out there.",

It opens your mind the the most important aspect of business which is get a customer and get them to pay. Nothing else matters if you have 0 sales. Once you witness the full process of sales it expands how you think about business systems. 2. Start something incredibly simple to get a grasp of all the functions. Sales , marketing, operations, finance, opening an LLC, accounting and tax. You get a taste of how all this stuff works. You can do it on the weekend. Like junk removal or auto detailing. Simple businesses you can start with $1000 or less to get experience. Then jump into a high leverage opportunity once you have clarity from action. Clarity comes from action not thinking or watching youtube videos. In my opinion the perfect simple service business for you to start would be test prep or tutoring. Lets say you were really good at preparing for test prep. Go tape 50 signs around campus saying, \"Test prep $40 off and guaranteed 20% improvement on test scores with 4 session minimum\".

Now he owns less than 15 percent, but the company is valued close to 170 million. So that makes his share worth about 25 million on paper.\n\nBut he is not even close to happy. Investors have all sorts of rights now. He says they went behind his back more than once. He feels like they kind of pushed him out.\n\nFrom what I can tell, investors decide who stays or goes on the management team. They skip all emotion and just say they trust the system, not him. Reading between the lines, it sounds like they want him out, but they are not buying his shares, so he cannot leave.\n\nHe is stuck inside a company he started. It honestly sounds brutal. Almost like he never really learned how venture works until it was too late.\n\nStories like this remind me why I am bootstrapping my own project. No outside pressure, no board calls, no one ready to pull the rug out. I get to actually enjoy what I am building, set my own pace, and keep control. Sometimes I wonder if more founders would choose this way if they heard about the real tradeoffs up front.\n\nP.S. For those who’ve asked me in DMs, my project is called IGScraping.",

Used it to find B2B leads for my consulting work (mostly targeting German companies - dentists, lawyers, small businesses).\n\nThe problem? Half the emails bounced. Customer support basically said \"yeah that happens.\" I was paying $1,250/month for a 50% accuracy rate. Insane.\n\nSo in February I got fed up and spent a weekend learning Python. Built a scraper that:\n- Finds .de domains in my target niches\n- Extracts emails from their contact pages (Impressum in Germany - legally required contact info)\n- Validates them before I even send an email\n\nRan it last month on ~2,500 dental practice websites:\n- Got 4,800+ emails \n- Bounce rate when I sent: 4.7% (vs the 50% I was getting before)\n- Cost: $43 in API fees + $12 AWS hosting\n\nI'm not trying to sell anything here. Just wanted to share because if you're paying for lead databases and getting garbage results like I was, you might want to look into building your own.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone's curious about the technical side.\n",

Second, centralize a simple asset table with fields for owner, status, serial, issue date, and return date, and automate a nightly digest that flags missing or overdue devices. For tooling a lot of teams stitch together a ticketing tool like Jira Service Management or Zendesk with an inventory table in Airtable or a DB, and then use whatever BI layer your team already uses to run weekly audits. If you want non-technical managers to ask “who has the MacBook from April” without bothering IT, a natural language query layer can help; some folks use Metabase, Airtable plus reporting, or newer NL-to-SQL layers like Astrasql so people can get answers without learning SQL.",

Maybe it's time to pivot, learn a new skill, or change what you can offer.\n\nThe term \"technological unemployment\" was popularized in the 1930's due to huge technology leaps being made during WWII which changed the business and labor landscape but technological unemployment has been happening throughout history. In the 20's the farm tractor was getting popular and caused mass unemployment for example. I'm sure many farm workers stood still and talked about how they can do more detailed work than a tractor can do, and talked about how tractors were taking away their livelihood, and those that could only focus on the evils of tractors got left behind. The smart workers would have learned a new skill and moved forward. The same goes for switchboard operators, skilled weavers running looms, lots of factory workers, etc etc. The skills necessary to run the economy shift as the economy does, but in the end [technological shifts are proven to net more jobs than they kill.](https://share.google/PahfHsDL4JbFsZzqV)\n\nThere will still be graphic design jobs and a demand for graphic design work that is done manually, just less of it. You can either pivot to a new industry or try to hone in on a certain customer type or a niche skill within graphic design and compete for those projects that require manual skills. Don't sit back and ruminate about how AI is destroying the graphic design business, roll with it and pivot or change. AI is here, and it is only going to get more capable.",

In fact in past 3 years we built our own agency literally opposing the AI in its core, as most of our clients are those who failed pushing their ideas through \"AI only\" or they are ready to scale.\n\nHow so? It turns out it's not really best idea to base your whole business on AI and generate everything. From very foundations to visual identity. \n\nWhy? Well, I might be lucky because I'm EU citizen and the AI is being restricted, but the main thing in copyrights is that AI is not generating original content on it's own. And if you for example generate a logo, it's not your property thus can be \"stolen\" together with everything what you generated. And this does not apply only to the logos, but to every single thing which you generate without human skill applied.\n\nSo worry not, this is only AI mania for some time. Your skills are still needed, especially if you aim at clients who are serious about their business and willing to do investments.",

If you want to sell me on your services, your offer has to be extremely enticing. You have to be able to replace the parts that I do, and as good or better than I can myself at a price point that makes sense for my business.\n\nMy advice would be to build yourself a personal brand so you can get an idea of the types of services businesses actually need.

When you became a graphic designer using Photoshop and Adobe products you were literally putting somebody out who was a graphic designer that didn't use those tools who was writing schematics by hand on a big sheet of paper.\n\nAI is this the tool that automates things including many of the things that I do for people so Now's the Time to start learning how to utilize things.\n\nI can give you an example of that as well. So I make ads for social media commercials all kinds of stuff and human wants to work better than ai.. ai ads do not perform very well if they're humans or pretending to be.\n\nBut pretty soon they might be but I'm using AI every single day now not just for planning and creative work and Etc but for actual videos because now I can do something that a Hollywood studio charge people $100,000 for for $500 or 1,000.\n\nSo while it might hurt some of my other aspects of work now I've got a new workflow using AI that I find very fun to do and it pays well now people that have huge Studios and expensive equipment yes I feel bad for them but they're not really needed anymore or as much...\n\nI can make a 30 second pretend trailer with special effects and stuff that a major movie studio had trouble making 15 years ago for millions and millions of dollars and create an original soundtrack for it and I only need to charge my clients $500 to 1,000 bucks because it does take time to create a decent one but the tools are there.\n\nAlso graphic design the writing was on the wall 5 to 7 years ago for the collapse of that industry the second Canva came out. \n\nThere are plenty of graphic designers out there though but they've been utilizing AI to change their business plan because people still need graphics and they still don't have the time to create them and they probably need an expert who can get them the best looking versions of it.

This post resonates because nobody tells you that entrepreneurship doesn't just test your business skills - it strips you down to your raw humanity.\n\nWhen our biggest client canceled a $400K order overnight in 2022, I didn't just lose revenue. I lost my ability to pay 59 workers who depended on me. I spent three nights sleeping on the factory floor because I was too ashamed to face my family. The 'boss' everyone saw during daytime video calls was a shell - inside, I was a 39-year-old man who hadn't eaten properly in weeks, wondering if I should just close the doors and get a real job.\n\nHere's what entrepreneurship actually is: it's looking your seamstress in the eyes when you can't pay her on time and explaining why. It's hand-delivering finished goods on your motorcycle at 2AM because the shipping company failed you. It's learning that your 'passion for fashion' means nothing when a client demands you redo 500 dresses three days before Christmas.\n\nI thought being an entrepreneur meant creative freedom. What it actually means is becoming the human safety net for everyone else's problems. The workers who need salaries, the clients who need deadlines met, the suppliers who need payments. Your personal anxiety becomes a luxury you can't afford.\n\nBut here's the unexpected gift: that confrontation forged me into someone I never knew I could be. Two years later, we survived. We now work with 15 international brands, and I've learned to build systems that protect both my team and my sanity. I take Sundays completely off - no emails, no calls - because I finally understand that sustainable businesses are built by sustainable humans.\n\nThe freedom isn't in being your own boss. The real freedom is knowing your breaking point and having the courage to build guardrails before you reach it. To everyone considering entrepreneurship: ask yourself not 'What's my business plan?' but 'Who will I become when everything falls apart?' That's the question nobody prepares you for.",

At least your old boss went home at 5pm.\n\nThe \"freedom\" narrative is bullshit. You don't get freedom - you get responsibility for everything. When the website crashes at 2am, guess who's fixing it? When a client doesn't pay, guess who's chasing them down? When you're sick, guess who's still working?\n\nBut here's what really separates the real entrepreneurs from the dreamers: Real entrepreneurs can't NOT do it. They're not choosing entrepreneurship because it's easier or more glamorous. They're choosing it because working for someone else feels like wearing shoes that are three sizes too small.\n\nIf you can be happy as an employee, be an employee. Get good at it, negotiate better pay, and invest wisely. There's zero shame in that game.\n\nEntrepreneurship isn't a career choice - it's a personality disorder that occasionally pays well.\n\nThe people who should do it already know they have no other choice.",

You mentioned that you kind of “just knew” what angle would work, I’m trying to get better at that.\n\nWould love your insight:\n\n1. How would you structure organic content for a customizable product where every order is unique?\n2.

How do you identify a viral angle before posting, especially for a product where every sign looks different?\n4.

Remember the noise you hear will never be about the failures. For every win you see, there are 10,000 failures. Be positive you want it before you start.\n\n2. If you don’t know what kind of business you want to start with the 50k, I revisit my point above. You need to want it so bad to push through the “I can’t pay my bills next month” times that will inevitably come. In order to do that, you need to either love what you’re pursuing or at least thoroughly enjoy it enough to push through the hard. Cause there will be a lot of it. \n\n3. If you have 50k, 2-3k should be used to actually start the business + sheer hustle. The remaining 47k should be used to get you through making jack shit or being u profitable for X amount of time. Don’t overshoot too early, you likely won’t need half of the shit you’ll invest in before you actually get started. \n\n4. Most importantly, if you’re getting into business because you don’t want to work for someone else - be VERY careful about the business you choose, the way you set it up and how much overhead you take on. Cause what you’ll see happen without even noticing it happening is becoming an employee to your own business. Remember to OWN your business, don’t let it own you. \n\nHope this all helps!

I make 5 digits monthly from the two gigs and Im scaling them up to this day. The problem is the process for getting it registered is so quiet complicated. \n\nIts basically under the table and i have no proof of income coming from it. Cause I sell products in fb marketplace or through friends and network. I have coding background aswell. And i want to try something new. Got fired yesterday but im going to be celebrating tonight for reaching $500k earnings from my gigs. Im the only one who knows this and i just want to share it with strangers here in reddit.\n\nI cant share it with family or friends cause I feel like its wrong, its going to change my life and attitude for the worse because of pressure of trying to maintain my successful image , but at the same time i want to share my success or to brag maybe? Reddit became kind off my therapy and therapist.\n\nToday is a good day. I enjoyed the ferry ride and the scenery. Im gonna be trading some motherboards for PSUs and SSDs and once i come back home, im gonna say sorry to my wife and come clean. Have a good day fellas! \n\n",

Sharing the numbers below!\n\n* **AI has doubled engineering output:** We have been consistently measuring developer output through PRs merged per developer per week  and cycle/lead time, and our data clearly says on avg, our throughput has literally doubled since started paying for either Windsurf or Cursor for all our developers. Everyone one of them uses one of these to write code now. Personally I love the Windsurf Cascade Agent.\n* **AI has made marketing cheaper significantly:** We were paying an agency like $5k per month to do SEO audits regularly and regularly post blog content on our website to improve search rankings. We were able to completely eliminate the agency and automate the whole process all the way upto posting it on our website using AI tools like Frizerly that has full context about our business, customers, Google analytics and what not!\n* **AI has reduced support resolution time by half:** So we always used Intercom and only had 1 dedicated support person! With Intercom Fin, we have been able to auto resolve questions that were already answered before or often already answered on our FAQs. Other questions are routed to the support person as usual. But since it's half the volume now, support can resolve other questions much faster. Avg resolution time went down from 23 hours to 11 hours!\n\nI can see companies being able to move like a 1000 employee company with just 10-15 in the next 10 years :)",

We had someone spending 5+ hours daily just updating customers on shipment status, answering \"where's my order\" questions, and handling the back-and-forth. Built an n8n workflow that monitors shipments, sends proactive updates, and handles most common inquiries automatically. Time saved is roughly 25 hours per week, which let that person shift to higher-value work like improving the actual customer experience rather than just reporting on it.\n\nSecond one is lead qualification. We were paying $200/month for a lead gen service that still required hours of manual cleanup and research. Replaced it with an automated workflow that scrapes, enriches, and scores leads based on our criteria. Cost dropped to about $10/month in API costs, and the quality actually improved because the criteria are consistent now instead of dependent on whoever's doing the research that day.\n\nThe pattern we've noticed across different implementations is that AI works best when you're replacing repetitive cognitive work, not when you're trying to replace strategic thinking. The wins come from automating the stuff that burns time but doesn't require judgment.",

          "body": "You are in a great spot at eighteen because you are asking the right questions before the mistakes pile up. Most people chase “big ideas” and skip the basics. The basics are what actually build a business. If I were mentoring someone starting from zero, I would start with simple habits, not fancy books. Learn how to show up on time. Learn how to communicate clearly. Learn how to listen more than you talk. Learn how money moves through a business. These are the things that matter long before strategy.\n\nFor understanding markets and business models, start with real businesses around you, not theory. Look at a local car wash, a cleaning service, a lawn company, a small shop. Ask yourself how they make money, where the money leaks, and what makes customers come back. You learn more from studying simple companies than you will from reading big corporate stories. Once you get that foundation, books like “The E Myth” and “Company of One” make a lot more sense.\n\nFor mindset, the biggest skill at your age is patience. You avoid dumb mistakes by not rushing into trends, not borrowing too much too fast, and not building something no one asked for. Learn to test ideas in tiny ways. Offer something small, see who cares, and learn from the response. That habit will save you years of wasted time.\n\nIf you want to build problem solving, do hard things on purpose. Work in customer service. Work in sales. Take jobs where real people expect real results. It teaches you how people think, how they react, and what they actually value. That knowledge is gold in business.\n\nAnd if you ever want another perspective as you move forward, I spend a lot of time helping young people understand simple franchise paths and small business ownership. It gives them a clear way to learn how businesses work without having to guess at every step. If you ever want a breakdown of what that looks like, I am happy to share it.",

I'm the type who competes with Elon Musk on boldness, Trump on deal-making, and Bezos on long-term vision.\nWhat I'm about to tell you isn't just advice. It's the exact roadmap that, if you follow it at 18, will make you a millionaire before 25 and a billionaire before 40, inshallah.\nFirst things first: Fix your brain before you fix your bank account\nThe most important book you'll ever read in your life (not exaggerating):\n\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" by Robert Kiyosaki\nThis isn't a money book. This is a book that completely rewires how you think about money. Read it 3 times in your first year.\nSecond most important:\n\"The Psychology of Money\" by Morgan Housel\nThis will explain why people smarter than you go broke, and why average people die as the richest guy in the cemetery.\nThird (the one that will make you understand markets from the inside):\n\"Zero to One\" by Peter Thiel\nThis is the book Elon Musk himself says influenced him the most. It'll teach you how to build something nobody has ever done instead of competing in a crowded market.\nThe books that will actually make you dangerous (read them in this order):\nShoe Dog by Phil Knight (founder of Nike) → Story of a guy who started with $50 and sold the company for $30 billion.\nThe Lean Startup by Eric Ries → Will save you millions in stupid mistakes.\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie (original 1936 version) → The single most important skill in business: how to make people like you and want to work with you.\nPrinciples by Ray Dalio → The biggest hedge fund manager in history teaches you how to build a machine-like thinking system.\nThe Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz → The only book that talks about the dark days every entrepreneur goes through that nobody posts about.\nBeginner mistakes that cost millions (never make these):\nDon't think a \"genius idea\" is what makes you rich → 99% of billionaires executed a normal idea extraordinarily well.\nNever work completely alone → Your first hire should be someone smarter than you at something.\nNever invest your money in something you don't understand 100% (crypto, meme stocks, NFTs, etc.).\nBiggest mistake of all: being scared of going broke. I lost 7 figures in 2011 and came back stronger. Failure is the real MBA.\nThe daily routine that puts you ahead of 99% of people:\nRead 30 pages every single day (no less).\nWrite down 3 business ideas every day (even if they're dumb).\nMeet one new person in business every week (even online).\nStart one small side project every month (even if it's with $100).\nThe single most important advice you'll ever hear:\n\"Start right now with something tiny and sell it any way you can.\"\nI started selling printed T-shirts with 500 Egyptian pounds in 2009. Now I own a factory that prints for the biggest brands in the Middle East.\nThe secret isn't the idea. The secret is that first customer who pays you real money.\nFirst project I want you to start TODAY (costs less than $100):\nOpen an Etsy or Amazon KDP account.\nUse AI (Midjourney + Canva) to design 10 motivational wall art prints.\nSell each for $5-10.\nThe first $1000 you ever earn will change how you see business forever.\nYouTube channels you should watch daily:\nAlex Hormozi (this guy literally gives away million-dollar strategies for free)\nCody Sanchez (how to buy small businesses and scale them)\nMy First Million (podcast + YouTube)\nGraham Stephan (real estate and money)\nFinal words from someone who's seen business from rock bottom to the top:\nBeing 18 is your biggest competitive advantage right now.\nElon was coding at 12.\nBezos started Amazon at 31 (meaning you still have 13 years just to train).\nTrump inherited money. You're going to build an empire bigger than his because you're starting from the ground.\nStart today.\nNot tomorrow.\nToday.",

It's because different teams just sign up for shit without even CHECKING if we already have it. Marketing has their own. Engs have their own. Sales has their own. Even our 2 person HR team has their own workspace\n\nI added it all up and we're spending like $900 per month on Notion when we could have one enterprise plan for close to 500\n\nAnd it's not just Notion btw. We have multiple Zoom accounts, 3 different Figma subscriptions, 4 ChatGPT plus accounts (why???) amd 2 AWS accounts that are both being used for different projects\n\nI brought this up to our COO and he just shrugged and said that that's what happens when you grow fast what an answer hahahaha",

      "selftext": "I do product sourcing consulting on the side. Small operation, just me, been doing it for two years. A potential client reached out last month saying she's a solo entrepreneur trying to launch her first product line but \"really struggling financially\" and could I please work with her at a reduced rate.\n\nI felt bad for her. We've all been there right? So I gave her 30% off my normal rate, brought my project fee down from $4500 to $3000. Told her I remember what it's like starting out and I wanted to help.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. I'm helping her evaluate supplier quotes and she casually mentions she's trying to decide between putting 45k or 60k into her first inventory order. Then she's talking about her \"backup funds\" in case the product doesn't perform well.\n\nI didn't say anything but later I'm thinking wait, if you have 60k liquid to drop on inventory plus backup funds, why were you crying poor about my consulting fee?\n\nSo I did something probably unethical. I looked her up. Her LLC is registered, public record. I found her personal LinkedIn. She's not some struggling entrepreneur. She sold a previous company two years ago. I can't find exact numbers but based on the acquisition announcement and her current lifestyle posts it wasn't small.\n\nShe straight up lied to me to get a discount.\n\nNow I'm sitting here feeling like a complete idiot. I gave her a discount because I thought I was helping someone bootstrap their dream. Turns out she was just negotiating and I fell for the sob story.\n\nPart of me wants to tell her I know and revise my rate back to normal for the remaining work. But we're halfway through the project and I already agreed to the price. Plus if she refers other clients to me that's probably worth more than the $1500 I'm losing here.\n\nBut I'm also pissed. I've turned down two other inquiries this month because I'm at capacity and I'm working with her at a discount while she's sitting on what looks like serious money.\n\nMy wife thinks I should just finish the project and never work with her again. My business partner thinks I should confront her because she disrespected my work and wasted my goodwill.\n\nHonestly I don't even know what the right move is here. I keep thinking about all the hours I'm putting in at a reduced rate while she probably thinks she played me perfectly. Maybe she did.\n\nI'm going to finish the project and chalk it up to a learning experience. On the bright side, at least the supplier research part has gotten easier since I started using SourceReady for vetting manufacturers. Wish there was something similar for client vetting though, would've saved me from this mess.",

If the discount is conditional, make it clear.\n\nSo if your normal price is $4500 and you want to give a low income discount, you quote $3000 and state \"30% low income discount\".

I agreed as I had been teaching them for years and we had a lot of goodwill built up. 2 weeks later both of the other 2 also asked for the same rate claiming “we’re all together”. I was pissed. Immediately it ruined my relationship with the 3rd student in my mind and I felt like I was getting played. I agreed to reduce for one of them but the other I didn’t. No 2 students are created equal and I simply can’t justify teaching this particular one for less than my full fee.. so she left. And yeah I wouldn’t be surprised if I lose the others soon too.

We were working on the branding stuff for his new business, the early stage bits, figuring out the look and feel and how he wanted the whole thing to show up.\n\nThen bad luck hit. I got slammed with this severe liver inflammation thing. The doctor told me to stay in bed for 2–3 weeks and cut my workload down so I could actually rest. I was upfront with my client about it, and he was super cool. I even managed to send small updates here and there so the project didn’t stall completely..\n\nBut after a point he just stopped replying. No “hey I need a break,” no “I’m rethinking things,” nothing. Two weeks go by. Nothing. I figured he was busy, but after the third week of being left on read, it hit me that the guy I thought was a long-term partner had just ghosted me without a word .\n\nFast forward to last week, I was scrolling through a business subreddit and saw a familiar brand name on my feed. It was him. He was asking for advice on his DIY branding and positioning assets he generated using some online tool. The stuff he posted was nothing like what he first told me he wanted. It honestly felt like he’d gone in the opposite direction overnight.\n\nTurns out some clients don’t tell you what’s bothering them. They’d rather ask the internet than have a simple five minute conversation.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with something like this or am I just catching weird luck lately ?",

Some things to consider:  A relationship where money only flows in one direction in exchange for goods and/or services is never a “partnership.”\n\nYou are a “vendor” to the customer even if you’ve felt a deeper connection and been made to feel integral to their success. Cheaper, flashier, faster comes along and bats their eyes and gives a sly smile and a wink at the customer every day in the form of competition. These days a competitor is the sweet, seductive sounds of AI, and the continuous news stories we hear of “AI to replace ‘x’ number of jobs.\n\nSo your biggest take away should be asking: how do I keep/retain my best clients? What process do I have to always be prospecting for new clients? If I ranked my clients into A,B,C,D list \n“buckets” - how quickly can I fire my D list clients and replace them with A list preferably or B list that I can develop into A list? \n\nAnd lastly, re: retention - any time a single client makes up more than 25% of revenue you are at risk. You inevitably start putting more effort into that account to the demise of your other clients. Come up with a feedback process that allows you to pulse check every account on a regular basis - and even if you get “We love you and will name our first born after you” - always be prospecting for a replacement client. They are always looking for ways to cut costs.",

          "body": "Most start ups in any sector are like this. The founders have to do everything until they outsource, hire, or automate. \n\nIn some ways, doing everything teaches you very quickly what you need to get ride or and how much you will pay to get rid of it. \n\nAn office manager (VA, etc) might be the first hire so you can focus on revenue generating tasks. Automation that you can easy into is also a focus in the early days. Even if there is only 1-3 things you can automate, the sooner you get that stuff off your desk, the better off you will be. Do not wait until you are 100% busy as the transition (outsourcing, training, automation) will soak up some time. Better to commit to a transition when you are at 70% to 80% of capacity.\n\nExpect the early efforts to outsource, hire, automate will stumble or not be smooth. It is all part of the learning to be a CEO rather than the production person.\n\nI am working with a company right now who is very busy with the work so it is hard for them to focus on automation. We are getting there. Presently, it is a grind (long days and me providing the automation help). For another client, they have more capacity yet they really need to focus on more sales so they can afford some of the costs to scale up the team plus automate.\n\nA bit chicken and egg is my message. As someone else said, you need spare cash to fund the business growth. Working on the business vs in the business. The working on requires a bit of cash now so you can gain more than it costs in benefits later.\n\nThere is no magic here. There are things you did not know or did not understand. Normal for a young business when the founders have not built a company in the past.\n\nA business that keeps you busy and never grows is a lifestyle company or a hobby. If you want growth, there has to be time and money invested in working on the business.\n\nGood luck. Reach out if you want to chat further. Or, keep posting questions in the group and leverage the experience of those who are already where you want to be.",

Stuff like tracking receipts, organizing expenses, and staying on top of tax prep is important, but it does not have to be done by you. That is exactly the kind of work a good bookkeeper can take off your plate. I work with Linda Rost’s Better Bookkeepers, and people in her lane basically specialize in turning that pile of “admin and tax stuff I don’t understand” into a simple, organized system you barely have to think about.\n\nYou are not failing at business; you are just hitting the point where doing everything yourself stops making sense.

Like you said, days go by and you're like \"wait, did I actually do any real work or just shuffle papers and respond to emails?\" I used to joke that I became a professional email answerer who occasionally did the thing I actually started the business to do.\n\n\n\nWhat helped me was timeboxing all that admin stuff into specific blocks. Tuesday mornings became my \"business operations\" time where I'd batch all the receipts, forms, emails that weren't urgent, etc. It felt weird at first because you feel like you should be \"working\" but honestly? That IS the work when you're solo. The key is just not letting it take over your entire day every day. I also started keeping a running list on my phone of all the random business tasks that popped up so I could deal with them during those scheduled times instead of dropping everything every time something came up.\n\n\n\nThe tax stuff though... yeah that never gets easier.

Even basic bookkeeping tools can flag things for you so you just approve instead of digging.  \n• Do a quick ten minute cleanup once a week instead of a full audit at tax time. Way easier on the brain.  \n• Keep a tiny buffer in your business account for unexpected charges so you’re not tempted to swipe the personal card just to get something done.\n\nWhen the financial side runs a little smoother and you’re not juggling every small purchase, the whole separation thing feels way less stressful.

People gave me that advice years ago and I wish I'd listened to them.\n\nIf you are a sole proprietor or a single-member LLC disregarded (and thus a sole prop. for tax purposes), though, it's a moot point since you can't payroll yourself, and you have to pay self-employment tax on everything anyway.\n\nIf you open an S (or C) corp, you can payroll yourself, and then excess money left over counts as dividends (called \"retained earnings\", and the rules for S corps are that all the retained earnings left over gets reported as dividends). Alternatively you could pay yourself a bonus on your payroll at the end of the year. A competent CPA/accountant will tell you which you should do and how much.\n\nOne of the benefits to being on payroll is that if your business tanks and you shut down... you've paid into unemployment and can legitimately go on unemployment, or (another likely scenario) you get another job somewhere else, get laid off in a few months, and then you're still eligible for unemployment. And the other is workers' comp - if you get injured on the job, you'll be covered - this is far more valuable than a lot of people think it is. Regular health insurance will be a nightmare to get your injuries paid for once they find out you were injured on the job.\n\nQualifying for a mortgage or loan becomes easier too when you can just show them a normal W-2 and paystub.",

          "body": "This is a tough one, and you should start preparing to not receive any of the money back. Idk where I heard it, so take this with a grain of salt, but the likelihood of recovering funds that are over 60 days past due is like, 15% or something. So as a general rule of thumb, you really want to get ahead of receiving payments as soon as they're 2 weeks past due, and follow up weekly until it is paid. It might seem like you're being nice and patient, but you cannot afford to be patient, you are not a bank. And you're letting your customer dig themselves into a hole of debt. So, here's what you should do.\n\n1. Stop selling to them until they've paid some amount towards their balance. In the past, I've agreed to continue to sell to people like this who had previously had been on good terms, but with the notice that their future orders will be capped at 30-70% of whatever their payment is (depending on how large their balance is, and this number can change as their balance goes down). This is risky, but is a negotiation tool that could help you recover some of the funds while still maintaining a good relationship. You could also offer to accept credit cards for the balance. You might have to eat a 3% fee somewhere, but better than nothing.\n\n2. Adjust your business to be prepared to not receive any payments. Try to cut spending where you can.\n\n3. You can eventually send this to collections, but collections will only give you about 30% of what they recover (if anything). Same with a lawyer, you might win the case, but will likely never see the money, plus you now owe all the lawyer fees. \n\n4. You'll need better A/R practices moving forward. Review your aging accounts weekly, and follow up weekly once the bill is over 2 weeks past due. Notify them in those emails that unpaid bills may result in restricted ordering and finance charges. Then stop selling to them. You are not a bank. \n\n5. If you don't do it already, make sure you're asking for credit references when onboaring new customers.\n\n\nAlso, here's a calculation to see how fast they'll be able to pay off their balance while continuing weekly ordering (not sure how often they actually order).\n\n(Current balance or number of open invoices - target balance or target number of open invoices ) / (payments per week - new invoices a week) = number of weeks to pay off\n \nYou said they had months of open invoices, so I'll just assume 3 months worth of open invoices, and that ordering is weekly, so 12 open invoices. And I'm going to assume they plan to pay two invoices es weekly, and continue to order once a week.\n\n(12 - 4 (4 open weekly invoices = net 30 terms, although, you might want to move them to net 14)) / (2 invoices paid a week - 1 new weekly invoice) = 8 weeks to catch up if you keep them at net 30.\nIf you only want 2 open invoices, it adds  2 more weeks to pay off, if you want the balance at 0, it would be 3 months to pay off if they are paying two invoices a week.",

Extending terms from 7 to 14 to 30 has proven to me 100% of the time that they will not pay on time no matter how long you give them. I have a client that stiffed me for over $100k. The money was always coming next week. Next week never came and it almost bankrupted me. I'm still struggling because of it two years later. I now bill ahead as much as possible because of it.

This is the only way you'll know what you have time for.   \n  \nI follow the mantra ***\"****Create in the AM, Connect in the PM,*\" but depending on your own energy patters use your energetic hours to do creative things, use your wind down time to do meetings and connect with people. If you have an extra five minutes, use the mantra \"*Do One Thing.*\" It might be one thing not on the list, one thing from tomorrows list, one extra thing, or just one thing. When you're really fried, use the mantra \"*Every little bit counts.\"* This will remind you that even if you simply make one phone call or take out the trash, that you're making progress.   \n  \nWhen you get something done, physically cross it off with a pen. If you need to add something, write it down. Next day edit the list from the day before, rinse and repeat.\n\nI'm sure there is science around this, but there is something magical that happens in this old school process. The brain dump reduces anxiety because you're not holding things in your head hoping they won't fall out. Creating the list each morning is very zen, and crossing things off is very affirming. There is no app in the world that works this well.

It’s about leverage.\n\nWhen people first heard the term “AI automation,” they thought it meant we were going to build agents to replace every human. And to be fair, that idea exploded back in 2022 everyone was hyping up these giant end-to-end agents that were supposed to do every step of your workflow for you. But in the real world, those types of systems didn’t hold up they broke, they bottlenecked, and half the time they created more problems than they solved.\n\nSo businesses learned pretty quickly: full automation is not the goal.\n\nAI automation was never really about automation, it’s about leverage, and here’s what I mean by that:\n\nInstead of building for the sake of building, you need to understand and apply the Golden AI Ratio. It usually looks like this:\nAutomate the first 60% of the process, the boring, repetitive steps.\nUse AI to assist a human on the next 30% the parts requiring judgment or context.\nLeave the final 10% manual, because sometimes a human simply does it better.\n\nThis is what actually makes businesses faster, smarter, and more profitable.\n\nSo the real question isn’t “How do I automate everything?”\nIt’s “Where does AI give me the most leverage, and what ratio of AI-to-human will maximize that?”",

We've built workflows where 90% is automated because the process is purely data transformation with no judgment needed. And we've built others where it's more like 40/40/20 because the context changes constantly. The key isn't finding one perfect ratio, it's identifying which processes have consistent enough patterns to automate vs. which ones need human judgment.\n\nThe shift from \"automate everything\" to \"leverage strategically\" is where the real value unlocks. We burned $50k on a chatbot that tried to do too much autonomously before we learned this lesson. Now we design around what we call \"augmentation before automation\", get AI handling the repetitive context-gathering and formatting work, let humans make the judgment calls, and only fully automate the processes that are both high-volume AND low-complexity.\n\nCustomer support is a good test case. AI can pull order history and draft responses, but if your product changes weekly or your tone needs to match specific customer relationships, that 30% \"human assist\" portion gets a lot bigger.

          "body": "This is such a refreshing take and totally nails the reality of using AI in a small business setting. Your \"leverage, not replacement\" idea is spot on. We found the best starting point wasn't a huge, complex workflow, but identifying the most soul-crushing, repetitive tasks. Things like transcribing meeting notes, doing the initial sort of inbound emails, or pulling standard data for a weekly report. The goal was never to eliminate the person doing the job, but to eliminate the most tedious part of their job. It completely shifts their work from \"painstakingly building from scratch\" to \"quickly reviewing and refining,\" which frees up so much time and mental energy for the creative and strategic parts of their role that a human is genuinely better at. The human touch is still 100% the most important part of the process",

AI will write one.  Need a report or analysis? AI will create one.  What are your symptoms? AI will diagnose you.  Summarize pdfs, books etc quickly.

Sometimes multiple times in a short period (15 mins and back in, all of them together). I don't want to automatically assume it's drugs, but that is my first thought. I'm in a small town of about 13k people. Even if it is drugs, I wouldn't believe it to be anything harder than a weed vape pen. It doesn't smell after they leave, and it's possible it isn't drugs at all, which is somehow more concerning. I've approached the door when they're in there, knocked and told them they need to leave and they won't unlock the door or respond. \n\nThere's a camera that can see the bathroom doorway and I'm considering locking the door and having customers need a key from the front desk and after I give the key to younger people, I'll need to watch the cc TV to verify only one person using the bathroom. I hate that I have to police the bathroom that way. \n\nHas anyone else had any experience with teens going to the bathroom together? This is both groups of boys and groups of girls (have yet to see both genders together). This seems super strange to me and my first thoughts of drug use, nefariousness or kiss just being idiots. None of which I want to tolerate. ",

At school, they leave a lookout outside the door who texts them if the SRO or another admin is headed in to check things out.  And then they switch up the groups who go in.  I think that's because not everyone has access to get a vape, so they're paying the person who has it to hit it.  Plus, doing something wrong is always more fun when you're with your buds.\n\nETA: if you're in a small town, they're especially not going to vape out in the open where people can see them because we all know that ish will get back to their parents real quick.  Just lock the door and refuse access for anyone under 18 or say it's for employees only.  If it seems like a genuine need, you can unlock the door for them yourself.",

My brain was fried, it wasnt even a celebration, more like a reset. For the next one, I'm say go with your vision and your convictions 100%. \n\nI learned the hard way to never do business with family or anyone who can't follow your vision. Not understand it, just stfu and follow it, do what I say. No unsolicited opinions. And thats a big thing when you open a new business, every asshole loves to give advice. \n\nWe closed it in 2017 after 3 years and to this day we sometimes talk about it and the regrets. Everyone had their own vision, their own shit ideas. They all agreed on my original business plan but then shit kept changing on a whim.\n\nMe and my parents were on the same page but when it came to execution of the business, our relatives fucked it up. Shouldn't have gotten involved in the first place.\n\nOur vision was changed and relatives kind of took over. My parents went along with it because they felt like they had no choice.\n\nIt built so much resentment, even from me to my parents because they let it happen. I wasn't in the position to tell my relatives anything, but they were. \n\nIt was such a shitshow. Hard lessons though, fuck if we had done my original plan, it would've been successful. I see it everywhere now, our original idea for that location was executed better by other people because they did it correctly. Multiple different businesses are thriving there now, with the same vision I had before all of em. \n\nAnyway, it sucks but we learned so much from that. Mostly the psychology side of it like you can't be nice and let people walk all over you, even family. Can't be too nice to employees, and definitely should've shelled out some money to hire an experienced manager. They cheaped out on that too. \n\nI'm going to start a business again in the coming months, this time I've been researching and planning much more thoroughly. \n\nThis time it will be a singular vision. My vision. No one gets to fuck with it. No one gets to give me advice on what to do, and get butthurt if I don't follow their bullshit. \n\nIf they don't like it, they're fired. I'm steve jobbing the fuck out of this thing. That is the only way. Good luck on the next one.",

There is a good chance a little entrepreneurial devil will whisper things in your ear again one day...but until then, take a nice clean break.\n\nPS: Your story really talks to the merit of having a partner vs going solo. Many assume you just need a partner but if you are really motivated, and don't want to waste time debating every issue - and don't want to be let down - going solo has a lot going for it too. I did both and for me anyway, the solo route was the better option.\n\nI wish you well. Take it easy for a bit. Cheers.",

While these methods can work, they often require a lot of manual effort. That’s where [WebIeadr](https://webleadr.pages.dev) comes in. A platform where web designers, developers, SEO specialists, and similar professionals can easily find and contact web design leads such as businesses without websites, in just a couple of clicks, along with many other features (check the website to explore all of them)!\n\nWebIeadr offers a one-time, credit-based system: **$12 for 100 business leads**. No subscriptions or recurring fees: pay only when needed. Credits stay in your account and can be used anytime, with options to buy more as needed. For example, if 40 out of 100 leads lack websites and 15 use third-party services (e.g., Facebook), and you secure just a mere 3 clients with basic sales skills, you could earn around $2,000. Your cost? Just $12\n\nThe bottom line is that WebIeadr offers an extremely quick and efficient solution to find web design leads in just a few clicks and **call them in just one click of a button**. From there, all you need to do is apply your sales skills to convince them that having a website is a worthwhile investment for their business.\n\nKnow a web designer, developer, or SEO specialist who could benefit from this? Please share this post with them. They’ll thank you later!",

You can’t own up to your faults if you don’t know them.\n\nDon’t take it so harshly because you still made a good deal of money. Whatever you did in the beginning worked!

I got thru this before and I can get thru this now.” \n\nTrust me, I get it. I’m going thru a very similar thing right now in my business. I’m in digital marketing and Google has completely screwed up my business model. I’ve been depressed about it for about 2 years now.

If she's more into gifts and likes flowers, maybe some flowers to lift her spirits and show your support, let her know you believe in her and help her see some of the things you pointed out here. If it's quality time -- take her out on a date and give her some of your thoughts maybe over a great meal at her favorite spot. Touch? Give her a hug and let her know some of the observations you had. Acts of service ... tell her you want to take some of the load off of her around the house as a show of support and let her know you're proud of the work she's put into this and that you think she should keep moving forward until she finds what works. \n\nSo many ways!

He worked for the state, and the PTO credit could be counted on like clockwork. \n\nSo the day after his PTO hits, he calls in with some excuse. One of these excuses was that he's walking up some stairs, he slips, his knee hits the edge of the stair right between his kneecap and his leg, and because of this his leg is swollen and he cannot bend it. \n\nThis all sounds credible enough, and of course the friend likes to go in intricate detail to really sell the point. \n\nNow the funny part. When he finally does go back to work. He's committed to this scheme of having a knee injury so he commits to limping around. Not only this, but he figures that if it was a legitimate injury at the beginning of a shift he would limp just a little bit, and as the day progressed he would limp more and more and so that at the end of the day he was really limping. Now I know for a fact this was all I made up story because we were drinking buddies at the time and I heard him concoct the scheme before he even did it. \n\nOkay and so now the cherry on top. After doing this for a few days, because of knee injuries not just going to go way overnight right, he's actually given an accommodation and an official recognition of service because of his working injured.",

One morning about 5am I was on my way to work and got stopped because of a major accident on the Hwy, fire trucks, ambulances, police, you name it. Talked to the Sheriff on traffic duty and he figured at least two hours to clear the road. Sent a pic to my boss and said I would try and go the long way around but I would be at least a half hour late. Turned around and drove down to the County road just in time to watch a semi miss a curve coming down into the valley and jackknife across the entire road. Called it in to the Sheriff, sent a pick to my Boss saying \"You wouldn't believe me if I didn't show you but...\" and told him I was just going to take the day off and go home.
