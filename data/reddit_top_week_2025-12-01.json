There are people who turn this into a real full time business! Another thing I’m considering doing is renting my driveway parking spot to long term parkers who use the airport. I don’t use it anyway and from what I’ve seen in my area you can pull an extra $300-$500 a month depending on the area and even more if you offer “free transport” to and from the airport which I would not do. There are literally so many ways to pull a few extra bucks out of the ol turnip! Good luck with your endeavors.",

          "body": "A couple I have had success with led back to leveraging a skill you have that would take too much time for someone to learn. \n\n1) Woodworking / Laser Engraving: Able to produce handmade customized items for people. A big time investment and not a lot of evergreen demand, but this year I've made an extra 14,000 in November just selling on the marketplace for Christmas gifts. Barrier to entry is tools and equipment and needing skills. Spend about 2 hours a day and 10 hours on my day off. \n\n2) Drywall repair: I focused on doing small repair jobs without paint. After a plumber or electrician came in and cut up the wall, getting a larger drywall company was difficult for customers. I would keep 2*2 sheets in my car and would tape and hot mud over a few days. I do a lot of small repairs in apartments and a couple of student houses.I reached out to contractors and painters and get 7-10 referrals a week. Usually convert 60%. Makes about 2-4k a month with materials cost of 3-500. Barrier is you need to know how to repair drywall well. It's about an hour to meet the customer and quote with a little followup. Takes about 5 hours spread over 2-3 days to do the jobs. \n\n3) Installing POS: Installing square or Shopify POS systems for small businesses. Setting up inventory management. Training. This is a great one. I can charge a premium. I network with the chamber of commerce and local fb groups. I charge $1000.00 for initial set up, and $300.00 a month for support and ongoing training. The value is that business owners are able to track sales accurately and the POS becomes critical to running their business Depending on sku count might be between 6-10 hours for the initial set up. I have about 6k a month coming in for residual income. I've used not to charge for the initial set up, but I found by charging the up front cost I was able to eliminate customers who didn't see the value and didn't want to spend money on their systems. Barrier is you need to know how the various systems work but no overhead or expenses to operate as I have my customers purchase / lease the equipment and licenses in their name. Plan a full 8 hours for the initial set up. Once set up I check in biweekly and may have to go out for an hour to train new employees or work out kinks. \n\nEdit: Added times",

          "body": "I made an Etsy store last year (cost was approx $22 in US dollars) and I only sell digital items (no personalization, no shipping, no costs beyond my time) in a very niche hobby area. I spent approx 8 hours making the first product for myself after I couldn’t find anyone selling it on Etsy. So then I thought I’d risk the $22 start up cost and see if anyone else would buy it for $3.  The next day someone did. By the end of week 2, I was selling nearly a hundred a day of the same identical product. \n\nSo that first 3-4 months or so, I invested my initial 8 hours time on the product, plus 1 hour to make an Etsy store, then approx 10-15 minutes a week answering questions/messages. I made approx $5k in that time.\n\nAfter that I invested a solid week of 15 hour days at home on my computer making new products for same niche field, after having spent an afternoon browsing online to see what others were interested in.\n\nAfter that full week of about 100 hours invested, I could go back to spending ten minutes a week answering questions for the rest of the year.  \n\nDid the same this year- spent one week with at least 100 hours invested in making new products, now just saved in drafts and I release one a week and answer a few messages. For as long as this lasts it’s been an absolute fucking dream come true. \n\nI think the key piece to my success was that I was myself looking for something on Etsy that no one else was selling yet, and I offered it for cheap ($2.99). I had no competition which meant that initially I had about a solid month of nearly a hundred sales a day. I’ve made $70k from it in last two years which means after Etsy fees and taxes that’s still about $2k/month for an averaged of ten hours a month. It ended up being more take home pay than my 9-5 job.  BUT it has no benefits or pension, so I’d caution anyone about quitting their day job if they have a pension or health benefits!",

It's filled with bottom feeders now because the barrier to entry has been lowered significantly with AI. \n\nI know that's not what you're asking for, BUT there is a niche within it that I started exploring early this year. It's proven to be exceptionally ripe, and now I make most of my income from that rather than convential development projects, and it even outperforms a few of my own MicroSaaS products.\n\nWhat I'm talking about is Bug Bounties. Tons of companies, pretty much all top tech firms, and tons of tech heavy blue chip companies as well offer these programs. You find a bug in one of their products, create a report, and submit it to their bounty platform. If it's accepted, they pay you, and often times, big cash. The bigger the bug, the bigger the bounty. \n\nIt's not even that hard. There is a barrier to entry, but it's not that high. With the AI race tech firms are spewing out products as fast as they can make them. The Silicon Valley motto of \"move fast and break shit\" is in full effect. \n\nI made $8500 just off the Gemini 3 launch, not just with Google but with all the companies using their AI API's on things like AI Studio and Vertex. \n\nIt probably won't last forever, I'm sure the bottom feeders will breach this niche soon enough as well.

Feel free to look up some YT vids but do NOT sign up for a course. It’s easy enough that you can do so yourself. Don’t expect crazy margins on most items, profits will really just come from volume (so so so many opportunities there)\n\nYou’ll need ~$1500-$2000 to start (this isn’t really your expense, just what you need to buy the thing you are reselling)",

          "body": "I have been managing and running online gambling platforms for over two years. Initially I did most of the upfront work to save on overhead (website creation/management, sales, cashier, marketing,etc).  now I outsource all my labor overseas and spend my time managing the staff of 4 people to provide 24 hour service. Revenue is high due to consistent cash inflows/outflows. Monthly Net Margin varies depending on traffic but it’s between 1k-10k monthly with the normal average being 2k-5k/month. \n\nI could likely make more money if I focused on better training the staff for marketing (and better dealing with disgruntled customers) but I have since handed the operations over to my wife and she does the bare minimum (pay workers, manages credits, expense reports, develops promotions). Because it is profiting monthly I just let it be and I focus on my main job. I will say this has allowed her to now stay at home and manage the kids since you can do all of this thru cell phones. \n\nSomeone taught me the basics early on and I developed new strategies along the way to get it to where it is today. This isn’t a get rich quick (unless you are extremely lucky with new customers) but if you invest the time and effort (I did my own brute force marketing 2 hours/day for the first 3 months), develop the right platform and clientele then you can also turn this into a nice side hustle.  Happy to give anyone more information if interested.",

      "selftext": " Right now I mainly rely on a few small income streams from home.\n\nOne part is paid surveys and small online tasks. I try to join better paid survey panels and treat the rest as pocket money, the key is to do them regularly. Sometimes I also use sites like Clickworker to take small tasks, usually around five to six dollars each.\n\nAnother part is Fiverr. I take orders there for website and app testing and give user feedback. This does need some basic skills and you also have to spend time building your profile and reviews, so the beginning is slow.\n\nI also do some niche reselling. I look for small rare items that some people still want, like merch from certain communities or old devices that are no longer made. I buy them cheap, clean them up and resell them. This part depends a lot on information gaps.\n\nThe newest part is using AI to make commercial videos for clients. I write a full script at home first, then use the commercial video templates in MovieFlow to create an AI version of the video. After that I bring it into an editor to fix the pacing, visuals and subtitles, then send the final video to the client for their website or social media. The pay for this is usually higher than normal small tasks.\n\nAll of these can be done from home and do not need a huge upfront cost. I am curious what legal at home side hustles are the most stable or most worth recommending for you. Is there anything you feel a normal person could start without a big risk or huge budget",

A tiny publisher wanted simple storybook style clips for socials and their site, two to three minutes each, calm pacing and very soft visuals,so we agreed to base everything on their “Kids Storybook” template inside MovieFlow. We agreed on 75 dollars per episode, they ordered 12, so I cleared about 900 dollars on top of my main job.\n\nThe pipeline is simple enough. They send me the story text and age range. I clean it up into a read aloud script, drop it into MF to get a first long storybook style cut, then do small tweaks in a regular editor like CapCut or Resolve Free intro, outro, timing fixes, light audio cleanup. Now that I have a rhythm each episode takes around 30 mins to 45 mins end to end.\n\nFor me this works because it is fully remote, the visual expectations are reasonable, and the heavy lifting of turning a full script into a watchable sequence sits on the tools instead of me hand building every frame in a timeline. Right now I am just treating it as a clean little sidehustle that fits into evenings without wrecking the rest of my week.",

I also went through the phase of trying a bunch of side hustles but the ones that eventually stuck were the ones I actually liked doing or were good at doing because you'll end up putting more effort into them compared to people who just decided to try it out but won't see it through",

I've tried recording videos when my kid naps and I just delete everything because I hate how I look.\n\nTried doing faceless content for a few weeks. Just text posts and stock footage. Got maybe 100 views total across like 10 videos. Everything I read says the algorithm only pushes content with faces but that's exactly what I can't do. I see these other moms posting and making a few hundred a month and I'm just stuck here.\n\n so i ended up trying APOB after posting this. basically you make a fake person and use that in videos. sounds weird but its getting way more views than the faceless stuff i was doing. still not making actual money but at least its not 100 views anymore lol",

She hates talking on camera but still needs simple video for listings, so we tried a setup where I produce three two to four minute tours per month and get a fixed fee per video. It works out to roughly 600 dollars on top of my main income when she sends the full three.\n\nMy current flow\n\nshe sends photos plus rough notes\n\nI write a calm walk through script\n\nI drop the script into MovieFlow to get a full slow base tour,then I bring it into Resolve Free to overlay real photos, tweak pacing and fix the odd shot\n\nI am not looking for clients here just trying to figure out whether this kind of small commercial gig makes sense long term as a side thing.

I want something that can slowly build stable cash flow, not something where I need to stare at charts every day and stress about it.\n\nRight now I am looking at a few ideas like small niche ecommerce, simple info products, and basic service sites, for example online booking or menu pages for local shops. My tech skills are okay but I am not an expert, so I am thinking of using a chat based website builder to launch a first version, then polish later. For example, with something like Genstore I could talk to it and let it help me set up a few landing pages for small projects, see which one gets clicks or messages, and then decide what to focus on.\n\nIf you had around eight thousand dollars, only wanted to do online projects, and the goal was steady cash flow with models that are already somewhat tested, which direction would you choose Would you spend more on traffic first, or build a few small sites to test ideas and then double down on the ones that work I would love to hear what worked for you and what to avoid.",

I also use it to sell options on relatively stable stocks e.g. Chewy (CHWY). I sell a monthly put options for a strike price that will net me at least $100 (2 contracts). I get the $100 plus the monthly dividend from fidelity. The risk is you are buying a stock that could potentially go down in value and you may lose money.

If Serbia has licensed betting sites you should basically be able to use the free bets/bonus bets that sportsbooks give out and turn most of that value into withdrawable money.\n\nIt’s not gambling in the traditional sense since you’re just taking the value of the bonus, but it *does* depend on what offers your local sportsbooks actually give. Like I said, I'm not from Serbia so you'll need to check, but it might be something worth looking into if you have legal, licensed operators in your area.",

You will have more time off than other professions and if you have children in school your vacation time will most likely mirror their vacation time. In addition, the retirement is not too bad. Many will disagree with me. I have known several people who have done nothing but hop from one job to the next for the last 30 years. I have no clue how they think they will receive a retirement. They have no pensions and have only paid into Social Security sporatically. One of my friends from high school actually had a certificate in sterlizing tools for medical procedures. I understand that the pay was decent. Unfortunately, she hopped out that job and started work for a convenience store. I think her retirement will include working in order to afford to put food on her table. I knew several people who have done the same thing as she did. It was as if it was a disease. \n\nAs far as going back to school. I knew some people in college who were older than me. No one thinks less of them. I never did. As long as you are serious about your goal it is possible. There is nothing wrong with it. You must put your mind into it and go the long haul to the finish line to get your degree, certificate, or whatever your goal is. Whatever the field is try to talk to someone who is in that field so you can get more information about and possibly how that job will do in the future.  As far as a new trade- if I were you I would make sure that I was compatible with that trade. Good luck.",

However, the position has made me very skilled in data entry with a sub 4% error rate on high complexity things. \n\nI’m crafty as hell. I can sew pretty well, knit okay, cross stitch, etc. I can also learn most crafts pretty damn fast. The only thing I’m not great at is drawing. \n\nI am also an avid reader. I read a lot of books and can speed read and can write as well, though again no technical writing or copywriting certs/experience like most listings offer. \n\nThe big catch is I don’t drive. I have a carpool set up for my 9-5 and my partner can get me places occasionally, but anything like uber/door dash, or a typical part time job is a no go. I also have unpredictable health issues that primarily affect my fatigue so I would prefer something I can self schedule, but can make do otherwise.

Build routines and follow it, most of the time procrastinating can be solved by simply knowing what you have to do next and keeping yourself occupied. Start with putting stuff up on your calendar, there are plenty of productivity tools and techniques you can search for. Most importantly, try to remove yourself from your distractions or atleast try to mitigate it as much as possible when you are in your productive state. \n\nFor example I have browser extensions to block YouTube and social media during certain hours. I actively try to only watch movies than a TV series because I know I’m a terrible binge watcher. And I also try to be outside as much as I can to be around people which sort of keeps me in check because I’m away from all the distractions at my home. \n\nAlso try to reward yourself with a break now and again or plan a fun activity for sticking with your tasks, you can literally put this on your calendar.",

Started making my own google sheets for tenant tracking, maintenance schedules, all that boring stuff. Made them way more automated with formulas and conditional formatting.\n\nMy coworker saw them and asked if she could buy one off me. I was like sure, 15 bucks whatever. Then she told her friend who manages a small apartment complex, and that person bought too.\n\nThat got me thinking so I cleaned them up, made them more universal, and listed them on etsy back in june. Didn't expect much honestly since its such a specific thing. But property managers and small landlords kept finding them. I guess there's not a ton of options out there that aren't either too basic or overly complicated.\n\nNow I'm averaging like $400 a month from it. Some months are $300, had one month hit almost $600. I spend maybe an hour a week answering questions or doing small updates when someone requests a feature. The money just hits my account and its pretty nice.\n\nI've got some money saved up from Stаke now and I genuinely don't know how to scale this thing. Like do I hire someone to make more templates? Start advertising? Expand to other platforms? I'm kinda stuck because this whole thing happened by accident and I dont really have a business background. I'm not even good at marketing. I just wrote decent descriptions, used the right keywords, and let etsy do its thing. Thinking about making templates for other industries now but haven't decided which one yet.",

      "selftext": "Lost my retail job in April. They cut hours then just let me go. Unemployment was $280/week which barely covered anything. Rent is $1100.\n\nTried applying to other retail jobs but everything was part time or minimum wage. Decided to figure out how to make money online instead.\n\nStarted an Instagram page about budget meal prep in May. Thought it would be easy. Posted random recipes and tips. Got maybe 30 likes per post. Grew to 800 followers in 2 months and made $0.\n\nTried to monetize too early. Put affiliate links everywhere. Nobody clicked. Page looked desperate.\n\nStopped posting for 3 weeks in July because I thought it was pointless. Then randomly posted a video about making meals for under $3. It got 35k views. Went from 800 followers to 4200 in a week.\n\nStarted posting more consistently after that. Had a few more videos hit 10k to 20k views over the next couple months. Growth slowed down but kept going.\n\nBrands started reaching out in August. First deal was $150 for 3 posts about meal planning containers. Thought it was a scam but they paid.\n\nMade $340 in September from brand deals and Amazon affiliate links. Made $680 in October. Made $900 in November.\n\nAlso started doing social media management for local businesses in September. Found my first client by DMing a coffee shop that had 400 followers and hadn't posted in 2 months. Offered to run their Instagram for $200/month.\n\nGot a second client in October, a nail salon for $250/month. Then a third one in November, a small gym for $200/month. That's $650/month from freelance work.\n\nTotal in November was $1550. First time I've covered rent and groceries without panicking.\n\nInstagram page is at 9k followers now. I try to post daily but realistically it's more like 4-5 times a week. Mostly short videos about cheap meals and grocery shopping tips.\n\nSocial media work takes about 6 hours a week total. Create posts for all 3 clients, schedule them, reply to comments. Pretty easy once you have a system.\n\nStill not stable though. Instagram income varies a lot. Some months brands reach out, some months nothing. Freelance clients could drop me anytime.\n\nBut it's better than retail. At least I control my time.\n\nTime investment is maybe 15-20 hours a week across everything. Costs are around $35/month for scheduling tools and some other stuff. Recently started using APOB at $14/month for profile content.\n\nBiggest thing I learned is you can't force it. That one video that blew up wasn't better than my other content. Just got lucky with timing. Now I post consistently and hope something hits.\n\nHow do you guys find brands to work with besides just waiting around?",

      "selftext": "I do web design + local SEO for small businesses in my area. Pretty normal setup — part-time freelance, steady client flow, nothing crazy. A guy reached out about two months ago saying he was trying to launch a home-cleaning business and was “really strapped for cash.” He sounded sincere, said he was trying to get his first few clients and didn’t want to go into debt.\n\nI normally charge $1,800 for the package he needed. I dropped it to $1,200 because I genuinely wanted to help someone starting out. He thanked me about five times and said the discount made the project possible.\n\nWe’re now halfway through the build, and over the past week I’ve started noticing things that don’t line up with the “barely scraping by” story. He mentioned he’d been busy dealing with a “tenant situation,” and I assumed he meant his landlord. Later he casually clarified he was the landlord. Then yesterday he said he had to move some money around because “one of the rentals needed a new water heater.”\n\nIt threw me off. People who own multiple rentals are not the same people who “can’t possibly justify” paying an extra $600–800 on a website.\n\nI didn’t go digging, but his LLC info is public and his name pulls up two properties in the county records. Nothing crazy rich, but definitely not broke. He’s also driving a much nicer truck than I expected when I met him in person.\n\nNow I’m sitting with that uncomfortable feeling where you realize someone didn’t lie outright, but they definitely leaned hard into a narrative to negotiate a discount. And I fell for it because I try to give new business owners the benefit of the doubt.\n\nI’m not planning to confront him — I already agreed to the price, and the work is fine. But it did make me realize I need to be more firm about discounts and stop assuming every client asking for a break is struggling.\n\nI guess I’m just venting. It sucks when you try to be flexible and it turns out the person didn’t actually need the flexibility. It makes you second-guess your own judgment, and that’s the part that’s bothering me more than the money.",

Fact of the matter is a lot of them are probably not even making money (especially the guys with just a couple properties).\n\nI KNOW it's popular to whine about parasitic landlords, but the guy probably prices in 1-200 profit per month and then loses multiple months of profit as soon as something (like a water heater) needs replaced. \n\nLabdlording doesn't replace a real jobs income unless you've got a ton of properties, or better yet, you e had the properties long enough that the current rental rate exceeds the mortgage and insurance by a fair margin. \n\nFor example, if I were to go buy a home today and try to rent it out, unless the sale price was an absolute steal, I'm not making positive cash flow on that property for a while (unless I put up an absurd rate and someone bites - but even then they have to bite quickly. Even if I can price in +400 per month, one month of vacancy means I've got to have a tenant for 5+ months just to break even assuming around 2000/month payments, reality is today I'd need even longer to break even, and +400 is pretty unrealistic)",

Create a simple, mini version first.\n2. Offer it for free to measure interest.\n3. Capture emails from everyone who downloads it.\n4. Build the full product *only* if there’s real, proven demand.\n\nThis is the first time I’m actually following this process — and honestly, it feels like a total game-changer.\n\n  \n**Your Turn:**\n\nIf you’ve built digital products or tried launching side hustles:  \n**What was your biggest early mistake?**  \nI’d love to know I’m not the only one who had to learn this lesson the hard way.\n\n# ",

          "body": "Passive income is kind of a myth at the beginning, but there *are* skills you can learn now that can turn into semi-passive income later once you put in the upfront work. The stuff that’s actually working going into 2026 is mostly tied to digital assets you can create once and keep selling.\n\nThe most reliable ones I’ve seen are things like building small niche websites that earn through ads/affiliates, creating digital products (templates, guides, printables), learning how to run automated email funnels, or picking up basic video production to make faceless YouTube content. They’re slow at first, but once you understand the systems they can run with minimal day-to-day effort.\n\nThe key is choosing something you’re okay doing consistently for a few months before it pays off. If you want something low-cost and learnable from home, building niche sites + digital products is probably the most beginner-friendly path right now.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/is-the-wealthy-affiliate-black-friday-deal-worth-it-heres-whats-included-november-28-december-1/",

Though, nothing more than 10$ at max). \n\nNow for YouTube, If you’re serious and can invest some money into it- I am willing to partner with you I can bring in the expertise/topic ideas that can work and you can invest if you find them good enough. For this too I have some serious ideas and will only be willing to discuss it with likeminded individuals. \n\nNow, for those who were looking for proofs of my earnings, I am attaching them here (Obviously some personal details are hidden but you can see the names and earnings) — https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11bWCxdt9SIwsz21WzFe-6gyJ9PRD5EUV \n\nPls Note: I have almost replied to everyone who reached out to me, commented back to everyone who wanted to know certain things. I have learned a lot from this sub and just want to give back. If you think I am a scammer, no problem, pls stay away from me and don’t get scammed. But if you believe you can turn your life a little bit better just like me, reach out.

I just feel that if I could make an extra 1–2k a month, life would feel a lot less tight. The problem is when I search online, everything is “passive income guide” and it just makes me more confused.\n\nRecently I have been trying random ideas. Some people say start a faceless video channel. Some say write templates and sell them. Others say open a small online store and sell a few very niche products. Tools are also everywhere now. I can use Canva for visuals, chat tools for copy, and for the website part I could use something like genstore to spin up a basic store and then tweak the details myself. On paper it all sounds possible, but in reality I only have one or two hours a day and I am scared to pick the wrong thing.\n\nSo I wanted to ask people here with real experience. If you were in my position with a bit of starting money and limited time each day, what would you focus on first. Would you launch the simplest small site that can take payments and see if it brings in a little steady cash, or spend a long time building one skill until you can take on clients. Also curious which small projects looked good at first but turned out to be really bad for beginners.",

The only real consistent passive investment is stocks bonds and real estate (and real estate is very rarely passive unless you're incredibly rich). If you want more money a better use of your time would be: 1. Try find a partner, not only will you be happier but you'll double your salary immediately, two people working is essentially a must in this economy if you're poor. 2. Spend time upskilling, it's very rare that a passive investment will make you 12k a month without requiring lots of money to start it, but you can easily achieve a 12k increase in salary by upskilling (you can actually get much more than 12k increase in salary). So yes, those are my recommendations.",

I started uploading game mods to [Modsfire](https://modsfire.com/?rf=130427). This service pays for each download with money generated by ads shown when downloading the files. They host your files and both of you get money. Rates are variable by country, but 1000 downloads from the US are worth 13$. I mainly try to get traffic from there, but I also get it from all around the world which pays a lot less, but cents add up.\n\nWanted to share here because almost everyone on reddit knows about some game that has mods.\n\nThis may be your first Internet passive money, take the opportunity if you can.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/is-the-wealthy-affiliate-black-friday-deal-worth-it-heres-whats-included-november-28-december-1/",

Validating before building anything**\n\nThis was the biggest difference-maker.\n\nInstead of immediately building the product, I spent time figuring out if it was something others would actually pay for.\n\nI shared the idea on Reddit and Twitter, reached out to founders, and asked questions like:\n\n* Do you struggle to find good product ideas?\n* Would you use a database of validated problems scraped from real sources like Reddit, G2, and Upwork?\n* How much would you pay for something like this?\n\nThe responses were overwhelmingly positive. That gave me the confidence to move forward.\n\n**3. Listening to users religiously**\n\nOnce I launched the MVP, I stayed close to my users. I asked them:\n\n* What's missing from the platform?\n* What would help you find better problems to solve?\n* What features would make you upgrade?\n\nThis approach made it so much easier to know what to build next. I didn't waste time guessing, I just built what users asked for.\n\n**4. Obsessing over metrics**\n\nI started tracking everything: website conversion rates, user activation behavior, and upgrade funnels.\n\nI could see exactly:\n\n* How many visitors converted to users\n* How many of those became paying customers\n* What actions made people more likely to convert\n\nFor example, my landing page was only converting at around 4% early on. I focused on improving that, and after testing different headlines and features, I got it to 9%, which directly doubled my revenue.\n\n**5. Focusing on real problems with buying intent**\n\nInstead of just collecting random complaints, I focused on problems where people were already spending money or actively looking for solutions.\n\nG2 reviews showed me what paying customers hated about existing tools. Upwork job listings revealed what companies were struggling to hire help for. Reddit posts highlighted frustrations people were venting about daily.\n\nThese weren't just problems, they were validated market opportunities.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nI had to fail multiple times before I figured out how to build something people actually wanted.\n\nThe biggest change this time was validating the idea early, but combining that with real user feedback, clear metrics, and focusing on problems with proven buying intent made everything easier.\n\nIf you're still trying to get your first win, don't give up. Build small, talk to users, and make sure you're solving something real that people are already paying to fix.",

I started an instagram last summer (2024) talking about how much energy healing and yoga helped me feel calmer and more at ease in motherhood. I got a lot of traction form that and some podcast episode invites etc, started taking it a bit more serious a few months later and launched a small membership site. It was originally just yoga and meditation sessions moms could do quickly in between nap times, diapers etc., but evolved quickly after winning some outside funding  that I applied for thinking there was no shot. About 16 months from starting my silly little insta page I’m now taking my little side business even more seriously, launching a full blown alternative spiritual wellness platform made for moms of babies and young children. Hired my first 2 contractors and we pulled in about 25k this year. I am very limited w how much I work since I’m a stay at home mom otherwise so I’m only putting in like 2 - 3 hours a week on this max, even at this more “serious” stage. People make fun of passive income streams like this by saying “it’s not really passive!!” But 25k a year to only work 3 hours a week with growth every single month has been pretty solid for me and my family. Not to mention summers completely off with contractors running almost everything and growth projections surpassing 6 figures in only like 18m -24m. It’s not hard to do this stuff tbh just find the right niche, listen to whatever people’s problems are, build a strong community culture, and don’t give up. Thanks for this post bc I literally never know in context how I’m doing or if my business is even a side project or how to even talk about it. I appreciate your honesty and you taking the time to communicate what has worked for you!",

But here is the secret: Don't spend it on \"looking rich.\" Take that cash and feed it into boring, reliable dividend assets (the \"Monsters\").\nIt feels slow today. But if you start the \"Owner\" mindset at 19, the compound interest does the heavy lifting for you. You win by being boring, not by being flashy.\nHang in there. 19 is tough, but you're asking the right questions.",

It’s all about finding a part of the market that’s in demand but eBay sellers aren’t honed in on.\n\nOr you can do research to see what sellers are selling the most of and try to compete with them. The secret that no one gets is that convenience is a very big part of this business. There are many people out there who don’t care about finding the best deals out of 20 different websites. They will use Amazon and eBay and that’s it. So find something outside of those two sites  that isn’t being sold much on eBay and list them. I had a thought about using wholesale stores to sell things like pet food in larger quantities than other stores provide. Toilet paper, etc. That’s dropship reselling. When you list an item and it gets bought on eBay, you order it from Costco, or Walmart (or whatever) and ship it to their house. Provide the tracking numbers on eBay and then you get paid after a grace period. Don’t start with big items because eBay will hold the payout on the first few orders you get until they are delivered and eBay ensures you’re not scamming people. Then once you sell about 10-15 items and they are successfully delivered, then eBay will be more forthcoming with the payouts. You get up to 200 listings before eBay will charge you for listing items. \n\nI plan on starting this kind of side-hustle very soon so if I remember I will check back in after a month with progress report.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you!

Every single thing that made any money needed me to show up again and again. Some things needed daily work, some could sit for a week or a month, but nothing was “set it once and forget it”.\n\nRight now the only thing that brings in steady money is a small dropshipping style setup targeting India. It is not huge, but it pays better than anything else I tried. Even so, it still needs at least an hour a day for ads, customer emails, small changes on the site and testing new products. When I first set it up I used a few tools to speed things up for the store page itself, including a one line website builder like genstore to get a basic store online, then I went back and fixed the details by hand. That part was “easy”, but keeping it running is not.\n\nSo at this point I see “passive income” more as income that does not need you full time, but still needs real attention. I am curious how other people here define it.",

The key difference is the decoupling of time-for-money that happens in traditional employment.\n\nYour dropshipping business sounds like it's in that sweet spot - not completely hands-off, but with better time leverage than a 9-5.

If you want remote work that doesn’t drain you, watch out for fake listings and ghost jobs on the big boards, wfhalert is decent for getting legit remote leads by email like customer support or basic admin so you’re not sifting through junk.

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/is-the-wealthy-affiliate-black-friday-deal-worth-it-heres-whats-included-november-28-december-1/",

I live in Ontario, Canada, and I’ve been trying to find a legit online/remote job for a while now. One of the biggest barriers I keep running into is that a lot of Canadian remote positions want bilingual English/French speakers — and I only speak English.\n\nMy situation is a bit urgent. I have MS, and my mobility isn’t great, so remote work is really the only realistic option for me right now. I’ve been waiting a long time for ODSP, and I need to find something soon just to stay afloat.\n\nIf anyone here has tips on:\n• Where to apply for English-only remote jobs\n• Companies that hire Canadians for fully remote work\n• Sites or communities that are actually legit (not scams)\n• Roles that don’t require a ton of physical activity or being on the phone all day\n• Any personal experiences with finding remote work in Ontario\n\n…I would be super grateful.\n\nI have customer service, admin, and leadership experience — I just need to find a chance somewhere.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to help. I really appreciate it.",

So, I wrote about the pain points, my audience had, gave a partial solution that they could get relief with then linked to the full solution.\n\nIt converted to sales.\n\nThe post didn't even go viral. It got around 20K views or so in the past month. This is from one post only.\n\nThat's it.\n\nI plan on trying it again, maybe targeting a different niche to see if I get different or better results.\n\nI think the key takeaway is that Reddit marketing can be done successfully. I love Reddit for how raw and real conversations here are.\n\nI don't want to water that down with marketing but, companies are already doing it. I think if you can balance helpful, value-packed content with driving business to your brand or offer, it can be a win-win.\n\n**What do you think?**\n\n**Have you tried this?**",

My partner: \"Stop doing that. You're leaving money on the table.\" Me: \"I'm building trust faster than I'm losing revenue.\" But honestly? I don't know if this is smart or stupid. On one hand: I've closed 2 clients in 2 months using this approach. Both specifically said \"I hired you because you told me when NOT to hire you.\" On the other hand: I've probably talked 10+ people out of paying me because I was only honest with them.

It filters out anyone who cannot afford you, saves you from low-value delivery, and establishes immediate trust with the buyers who actually matter.

You’re probably hurting them even more adding more to their plates instead of letting them focus on growing their businesses. Smart owners deploy resources for tasks they should not be doing. Now learning how it works after the setup is vital and where you come in. \n\n3) As someone who also loves to empower people as well, know you cannot hurt your business by doing so. If a client isn’t a good fit or can’t afford your service, that’s when you can spend a few minutes empowering them to DIY. That’s what we call goodwill. So if you help them out, they keep your name in mind when someone else needs your service. But not before you try to gain the service first. You are in business after all.",

I've always had a job ever since I was 14 and I made sure in every single one to do stuff that wasn't in my job description to gain experience...many times trying to get experience doing certain specific things so I could put it on my resume for the next job. \n\nThen, when I graduated high school I went to college and got a Bachelor's Degree, worked in b2b sales for a radio station for a year before going back to college to get a Master's Degree, which I graduated with when I was 24 and got an entry level job doing b2b sales with a part time bartending job on the side and started a freelance graphic design job in my spare time. \n\nThe b2b sales job was just a stop gap until I could find a Graphic Design job. Once I got the Graphic Design job, I job hopped every 2 or 3 years...Graphic Designer to Marketing Coordinator to Art Director to Creative Director to VP of Communications, which was a $100k per year gig. All the while, I always had extra income from my freelance business. \n\nAfter almost 4 years of the VP of Comms job, at the age of 36, I quit to try and do the freelance business full time...had 10-15 core clients...rebranded the business as a 'Creative Consultancy' and went very aggressive after new clients and hired a couple of talented young designers that worked for me in my previous role to work part time projects for me on the side while I sold and handled the client service side of the biz. \n\nYear 1&amp;2 I paid myself a $38k salary...luckily my wife had gotten a promotion at work from her $45k a year job to a $65k a year job, so we buckled down and made it work. Year 3 I hired my part timers on full time at $50k a year each and knocked my salary down to $30k a year. That year propelled us forward and I was able to give myself raises in Year 4 to $50k and Year 5 to $65k. The business was making money and I had enough retained earnings to stary another business with a business partner. \n\nI'm approaching Year 7 fully self employed as a 43 year old man with 2 businesses...my Creative Consultancy where I pay myself $120k and my other business where I pay myself $30k...and my wife, a 44 yo woman, is up to $75k a year. We make $225k as a household in the Midwest, own a $350k house with around $130k left on loan with 3 cars (all paid off) and a full time camping spot on a lake. We each still have $20k in student loans but I've got about $60k in high interest savings, $120k in a 401k, and 2 businesses that would sell for probably $500k and $200k respectively. \n\nI'm not rich but I live a very comfortable life that I would have never imagined growing up. I spent half my childhood in a trailer park, the other half in 3 different apartments before my parents bought a house in the rough part of town when I was a junior in high school. Both of them have passed away but they struggled with addiction their whole lives. \n\nMoral of my story is - stay curious, always be open to learning new skills and if the opportunity presents itself to start a business and go out on your own, go for it. My wife and I both spent a lot getting educated (we both have Master's Degrees) but it paid off and we have consistently moved up in our careers. \n\nMy biggest word of advice would be to stay patient. I was so eager to move up in my younger days and I got so frustrated when it didnt happen. I was 30 with a Masters Degree thinking I should be making $150k a year because I was smart and talented and I got passed up for opporunities because rich people's kids were more connected and they did it so effortlessly that it really pissed me off and I had a complex about that until I started my own business. I control my life now...and its great. I'm not rich but, from where I came from and with where I live, paying myself $150k a year aint half bad...and I'm still growing my businesses! By 50 I want to be making $300k - who knows if its possible but I'm doing everything I can to try and make it happen. \n\nHope that helps!",

People will pay to make their life easy if you are around a target that you want to hit find out how to make their lives easier. That is the way you become a billionaire.\n3. Rich is literally a state of mind. If you are not happy with what you have right now you’re not gonna be happy with more. I found this out the really really hard way. Make sure you’re right inside otherwise the money will just hide the crap even more And at the worst possible time the crap will show itself and the money will go away.\n\nThese three should get you started &amp; are good anchors. Your life will kind of dictate where to go once you find your wedge be very good at what you do so that they recommend you to everyone they know. \n\n\nThe thing with a lot of people who seem rich with the cars and stuff they’re not actually rich they just have access to the things that make them look rich.

I found a job that I thought I'd enjoy and pay decently. You can use government data to search careers, incomes, and expected demand to find something that pays well and hopefully is growing. \n\nNow that I have a good paying job and kind of settled down I've been thinking of trying some additional ideas. I've also always been pretty good at managing and saving money and now have the time and money to start something, but even without that, based on my current savings and career path, I will reach all of my financial goals and am on track as well. Finances are a skill that can be learned, there are personal finance subs with how to do that.\n\nI suggest finding a way to earn income whether that is some formal education or something informal like through receiving mentorship through some work path. Or even start something low cost, even if you don't make much you can learn a ton. Find a way to enjoy the journey. Work on mental health to get stable and set there. Get good at managing your money. Delaying kids but finding a great and supportive partner is helpful. And as someone else said, ask those people you encounter in person how they got to where they got, and what they recommend.

Went to public school, nothing fancy. When I was 12 my parents got a new job opportunity with the same company in a capital city. It was tough the first few years, our family lived in a 2-bed apartment and my brother and I walked to school every day. But my parents started earning better salaries and then we moved into a big house with some other family members. Can honestly say the communal living arrangement helped a lot, everyone chipped in and we were super happy and close together. It also gave us the opportunity to look after my gran, who eventually passed away from cancer.\n\nWhen I was 14 I tried to find a waitering job but couldn't get hired because I was legally too young to work. At 15 I did get hired to waiter on Sundays at a coffee shop at church. I also did some photographer's assistant jobs for my friend. He couldn't pay me a lot to help him, but it opened up learning opportunities. When I finished school I didn't get accepted into university so I took a gap year and worked 4 days a week at my mom's office. On Wednesdays I would attend enrichment classes to prepare a new application for university. I finally got in and applied for financial aid, which was accepted as partly loan partly bursary. So my family didn't have to put me through uni. I worked part-time while studying - while the other students were out partying or traveling, I was grinding to pay for my stuff.\n\nOnce I graduated, I was hired full-time. I didn't have a car or much living expenses and cycled everywhere I needed to be. I started getting some of my own clients and freelancing on the side. Eventually quit my job and took my freelancing further. That was really tough but the amount of learning I did was invaluable. I made a lot of mistakes and sometimes couldn't pay rent. My clients were kind and would sometimes pay for work upfront so I could keep the business going. In the meantime, my study debt mysteriously disappeared - I didn't get any calls, I couldn't log into the portal. It's like they forgot I owed them money at all (I was faithfully paying it every month, so maybe a bursary kicked in that I didn't know about).\n\nI went on to work for a startup and that was a big jump in upskilling. Started studying part-time again and paid for all of it cash. Moved from the big city to a small town where cost of living was much cheaper. Bought a condo and a super nice car, living comfortably, have a Master's degree, no study debt.",

          "body": "This question comes up often. You all seem obsessed with some “optimal” path to success which is where I think you’re wrong. Success is finding your path and it’s likely rocky, full of twist and turns, so the point is to start moving forward in the right direction so you’ll eventually get there. \n\nI started working odd side cash jobs at 12/13 yrs old. I got a “real” part-time job with a W-2 at 15. I immediately hated working in restaurants, so found a job in telemarketing sales. I had a lot of sales roles from there on. I went to college and came out and worked in door to door business sales. Then I moved cities, took a random job at an insurance company, and found my professional niche that I’d later build a multi-million business around. Now almost $40NW and $4M in annual income. At no point during this time did I really know how all this sales, customer service, and insurance experience was preparing me for my future. I was just showing up and working and figuring things out. \n\nI think young people need to go work. It’s a self-selected group here but it appears a lot of people online are focused on building a company from their bedroom. If there is one piece of advice I can give- go work somewhere with ownership in mind. Work anywhere and start learning something about organization, processes, bookkeeping, employees, team building, etc. Learn what it means for people to depend on you and vice versa. Once you work it’s so much easier to see problems and come up with ideas on how to solve them.",

Here it is:\n\n**Most people will die in the exact same socio-economic bracket they were born in.**\n\nThe greatest lie American capitalism convinced us of, is that *anybody* can be rich if we just work hard enough. **Well, statistics does not support that.** About 1% of the population actually make it from poverty to financial independence. Would you set out to try to get rich if you knew there was only 1% chance or less of making it? Probably not.\n\nBut most of us have been made to believe that number is much higher than it actually is. And it works wonders for productivity - a whole nation working themselves into an early grave trying to chase the statistically unachievable dream.\n\nSo when you see rich people who've \"made it\", they're almost always born either rich or financially advantaged already. Know this. Many pretend that it was \"all them, all hard work\" that got them there, but when you dig a little bit deeper, it's almost **never** the case. They got startup money from a rich someone, had a family that could afford to send them to Ivy League, they inherited a few properties, got their first internship at uncles company on Wall Street etc, etc. True rags to riches are very, very rare (and of course my hat is off to those - but they're unicorns).\n\nSo, the lesson I took from this realization came embarrassingly late in life, I have to confess. But it decoupled me, made me wake up to a new view of it. And it was so refreshing: I've always been self-employed, but I've now shifted my focus to no longer focus so much on the end goal and the next big thing, but to have a decent time on the way there. If I can afford to feed my family, put a roof over their head, have a vacation or two a year and afford my hobbies, friends, a few restaurant visits - then that makes me rich. Sure, I'll take becoming a millionaire still, but I'm no longer chasing that dragon - I'll let the dragon come to me if it wants to, but only if it's friendly.",

You want to go from having no money (and no social status) to having money (and the social status that comes with it). That expectation might frustrate you when it actually comes to building a business.\n\nWhy do I say that? Well, most people don't ever invent nothing. Inventing is hard and requires a lot of knowledge, especially in a post industrial society in which knowledge is very advanced. Inventing can also be frustrating and don't necessarily lead to a sucessful biz. On top of that, most business fail, and fail spectacurly at that - I'm talking personal bankrupcy level here.\n\nWith that said, what is business? Business is fundamentally based on identifying a demand, building a solution, selling it to the market and delivering it with efficiency in a way that the customer will be supplied and happy.\n\nTo do that, you don't need to invent anything. You need to understand how it works, build the necessary skills, save money and basically risk it all in making it happen. There is a lot of failure and pain involved. Studying and getting a good job is a lot safer, if not easier. If you land a good job in the six figure department, you can have a good life (i. e. money in the bank, a good car and good house) without the risk and uncertainty involved in being a founder.\n\nIf you still choose to do it, start with something small and prepare your emotional skills to handle rejection (sales), uncertainty (money related risk) and loneliness (you will become different than 95% of people, probably including family and friends).\n\nOnce you do all that, brace yourself for a journey of personal development, high highes and low lows.

I stopped being disciplined and didn’t earn anything.\n\nAt 16 I bought a web dev course (€87). Finished it fast, made my portfolio, emailed clients from IG and Google Maps. But again I realized I don’t actually enjoy it and stopped. The course was good, just not for me.\n\nNow I’m still 16, spend a lot of time on games and social media. I want to work and make money but I feel like I have no motivation anymore. Every time I start something I quit fast.\n\nAny advice for my situation?",

Tune out the rest of the noise, and likely people that are going to tell you every single reason why you are not good enough. That is projection. We are all hurt from this society, but most especially the ones who did not have financial security. So nine out of ten times you fail simply because of self-sabotage, while the latter is to others around you trying to succeed. What you learn over time is there being a false metric that is considered as **success**. People are adamant on this division because they have been convinced (from it happening to them) that is the only way to do business. That is a flat out lie, again.\n\nThe main objective of this reality is to connect, help, and love each other. That starts by healing yourself first from the plastic society we're in. Once you do that, the opportunities will come. It will not be in the way you initially thought.

There's earning potential in that industry, just I would never get it because I don't like it. Starting anew did not hold me back too much. \n\nMy husband went from one he loved to one he loved even more. He made the switch 2-3 years later than me but, but has also 5x'd his salary by now. However, he has built a way deeper foundation than me, so his upward potential is much higher. \n\nThe difference between us was, I'm only motivated to do as good of a job as I need to get promoted / retired.

My parents worked very hard and made very little but put all the money into educating me and my sibling. We took that very seriously and saw my parents working hard, so we worked hard at school -- no partying, no fun times, just pure studying. And studying was fun! I went to the best undergrad university in my country due to that, got scholarships (my parents paid 0 dollars), and then got a fully paid scholarship for a masters in North America. Once I finished that (with a 4.0 GPA), I got a pretty low paying tech job ($35K annual) but I switched jobs every 1.5-2 years, which led to huge increases in pay. After about 8 years of experience in tech, I went to a FAANG company at a management level which brought my annual pay to $400K. I'm also good with saving and moderately ok with investing, so my current net worth is about $700K. Thinking about where I started (with $0) about 13 years ago, I am very grateful to my parents for having given me the education and skills of choosing the right things to focus on which helped my life.\n\nSome key points worth mentioning:\n\n\\- I went for a mix of work experiences: startups/big corporations, client facing/backend, management/IC, etc.\n\n\\- I focussed on improving my people skills and communication techniques at every job I had. This is so hugely impactful and not very appreciated.\n\n\\- Being in cross cultural settings, I focussed on immersion into the culture I was situated in. That helped in being more adept at earning trust and being savvy with work colleagues.\n\n\\- Being curious helped me be aware of what is happening in the industry and where to go next.\n\n\\- Being always open to new opportunities and not being too loyal to a company or place helps. They are not loyal to you.\n\n\\- As I grew older, focussing on \"fun\" and \"rest\" became more and more important. People that only work hard and don't have a life burn out eventually. Before I met my wife I spent many years considering finding a partner as my main job and my actual job was a side-hustle, because I knew finding a partner is a more impactful decision than any other in life. Similarly, eating well, exercising, and spending time in nature sustain us to do well at work and ignoring those can really impact productivity.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or thoughts. \"Working hard\" is a good mantra but there are some nuances to it. Working smart, being curious, prioritizing not just \"work\" but also \"people\", and being serious about fun are all as important.",

Sometimes is not worth scrounging up for peanuts in return. And money matters in general. Only money can open certain doors and nearly guarantee success by letting you brave the waves of pushing yourself into the market as a business. My family nearly bankrupted once as we couldn't cushion a store for long enough. Two very bad years and yet months later the place boomed... Not a nice experience \n\n4) no matter how much money you have to inject, you are STILL a slave to the chaos of circumstance. You cannot time the market, only gamble. And you will always hear biased answers of those who succeeded \n\nIn general, the path from nothing is making sure you can generate as much value as quickly as possible for you to invest in a business (more work, more risk - something you should ALWAYS be aware of -, but much higher return) and repeat. You have to be bold and yet conservative, you have to move and move and make connections everywhere to catch up to people that already has that and actually compete. And then pray to whatever god you have (literally or metaphorically) for the market to be kind to you. And then rinse and repeat. Hopefully you scale fast enough, but realistically even if you succeed it will likely take a generation or two with the same drive to get there even in the best cases (discounting outliers)\n\nAs for the people I knee that made from significant to a lot of money they could not do the same today and most did so though real estate ish: one made a jewelry business (won't name her because of doxxing), another capitalized on 2001 crisis in here and bought a lot of stuff for dirt cheap and held for a few years, now he owns entire buildings. Another one got tired of being a dentist and started selling clothing to the countryside and used the money to buy property. Another one inherited a shoe factory lol but to be hair he was a programmer and likely pit quite a bit of money I to it too, another is a lawyer and got.. lucky let's say. There are others that never reached a million but still made good bucks, mostly doctors, a few engineers that migrated, a dude that bought movies for cinemas/theaters, farmers, etc etc\n\n I'm worry for being general as I don't have a personal anecdote but I genuinely don't think there something else than it.

      "selftext": "About a month ago, I got a ride from a bright and starry-eyed 20s-something who had just moved to my city. He left his family behind, some 1,500 miles away - said he wanted to make it and seek out opportunity.\n\nWe got to chatting, told him a bit of my backstory selling across FAANG, some startups, and now being a founder. Turns out he has a background in sales and is hungry for knowledge + experience. I've been wanting to mentor a seller since I never had one myself (apart from the books I read), and this is the first time someone has actually taken me up on the offer. It's crazy considering how many people say they want to make it but don't take any initiative.\n\nI'm giving him a chance in hopes that grit and sheer determination outperform pedigree (we typically recruit from Ivy League and technical universities). I've always held the hypothesis that many people have the drive to better their lives, but not everyone has the opportunity. Now we get to test it. Anecdotally there seem to be three core elements to success in entry-level B2B; the \"Want\"; the intelligence filter; and the execution filter.\n\nI've hired him on as a BDR on a 6 month contract. By my calculations, if he's even 60% as good as I am at setting appointments, both the company and he will have positive financial outcomes.\n\nI look forward to updating the group as this progresses, and I hope this serves as a gentle reminder to take a chance on the underdog.\n\nHappy U.S. Thanksgiving to those that observe.",

More recently I got into real estate development, focusing on outdoor alternative assets. I was even designing an RV park at one point.\n\nThen shit hit the fan when our family grew by one, and I had to pivot away from that venture. I’d been working with people who were way in over their heads and outside their skill sets; myself included.\n\nOut of that mess, I ended up getting hired as a VP at a company that’s now worth 9-figures, just a little over a year after relaunch. It’s easily on track to be a 10-figure company in the next three years or less. We’re building a game-changing application of solar technology for trailers and other mobile platforms.\n\nThe CEO first saw what I could do almost ten years ago, on my first day consulting for him, when I upgraded the technical capabilities of his flagship model; changing the way he tracked his fleet (still only one in the industry doing this to this day). When things went south with the RV venture, I called him. He told me he had big things coming if I could wait it out.\n\nI did. It was brutal.\n\nBut now I’m here, developing software that’s going to help cement us as the leader in this space before we expand to other verticals. The world is our oyster at this point.\n\nSo yeah, having someone take a chance on you and proving them right is half the challenge. Proving it to yourself is the other half.",

          "body": "Many people think running ads will solve their problem. But ads only amplify what’s working (or not working) so if you run ads to an offer where the offer isn’t clear and isn’t working organically it won’t work whether you get 100 views or 100millioj views.\n\nThis ad is offering something to do with sales but the promise is not desirable. It says: win contacts on merit. \n\nNo one sits there saying I wish I could win sales on merit. They say - I hate selling, it’s hard. They say no one buys. I don’t know how to handle objections. I don’t know how to sell. I don’t know why people aren’t buying. I need someone to tell me what to say. Etc. And the language they use will be very different depending on whether they are new to selling or seasoned sellers looking to up their game. \n\nYour offer isn’t clear. I don’t know who it’s for. I don’t know what you’re solving (sales sure but what exactly and how?) your hook is not strong. And the comic doesn’t make it clear what I’m getting if I click.\n\nSo for example: Therapists: struggling to get people to say yes to working with you on your sales calls? Only booking 1 session at a time and then have to keep reselling them? Check out the simple 2step method that’s helped hundreds of therapists book out their practice and sell 6month therapy packages without cringey sales scripts or pushy tactics. \n\nOkay so I made that up completely but I want you to see: \n1. I know who I’m helping - not everyone struggling with sales - I’m helping therapists.\n2. I understand their deeper problem - people get on an intro call and don’t want to commit to more than 1 session at a time. It’s frustrating having to keep reselling and they can’t really get people results in 1 session. \n3. I understand their problem with sales - they don’t want to feel salesy or pushy or learn scripts.\n4. I have a simple two step framework to make selling easy.\n5. I have a clear result - they’ll be able to sell 6 month packages easily. \n\nNow as long as I can actually fulfil that promise and get them real results that will get clicks. But what will make it a successful business will be testimonials and word or mouth and referrals as I become known as the person who helps therapists make sales. \n\nSo if you’re genuinely wanting to help people make sales:\n\n1. Find a niche group of people who are struggling. \n2. Work with them for free (I worked with my first clients free for three months)\n3. Get them results - figure out where they’re getting stuck, what they really need etc and get them results.\n4. They will become your biggest fans and be happy to share testimonials and results and some will even want to continue working with you - paid. (Thats how I got my first paying clients)\n5. Then go and offer more people those results - you will now have a clear niche and clear promise and clear results so selling becomes easier. And you do it discounted 50% off kind of thing. You see many people do founders launches etc for this kind of thing. Get 10 more people. Get them results. Now your testimonials are growing. \n6. Now you can start selling at full price and start scaling. \n\nThat’s how I built my business coaching practice and it’s how I’m busy building my second business which is my accounting practice while still running my coaching business. \n\nIt always sucks when you try something and don’t get the results you wanted. But the key is you were brave enough to try. You clearly want to be successful in your business and you’re asking for feedback. So go and learn everything you can about making a good offer and then try again. \n\nAll the best!",

Most won't be tomorrow. However if you can build enough awareness that when they enter the market, your name is thought of, then you've achieved something worthwhile.\n\nI've been thinking about how to use this - to create \"zero click\" ads, where the idea is NOT to get someone to click the thing or come to the site. I actively want people to avoid clicking (unless they're desperate for what we sell) to keep costs low.\n\nThis then changes the role of the ad to be more about creating a memory of who we are, what we do, and when you should call us - without annoying people (because then they'll remember us as a bunch of people who stole their time). \n\nI've not worked out how to do this yet, it's an idea that I think should have legs.

It sounds like you've already cracked the code on getting attention with your creative, which is the harder part. The leak in the funnel is likely at the moment someone clicks through. When people see an ad, they're in \"defense mode.\" When they look for a business, they're in \"search mode.\" The single biggest factor that switches someone from a skeptic to a buyer is seeing authentic reviews from past customers . Your landing page needs to instantly build the trust your ad can't.\n\nInstead of pouring more budget into top-of-funnel ads, a powerful pivot would be to invest in building that unshakeable social proof first. This means a dedicated strategy for gathering genuine, high-quality reviews. It’s a foundational marketing asset that makes every subsequent ad dollar work harder. For a service that specializes in this exact process, you could look into StarBrite. They are a review and referral gathering company located in Provo, UT. Their model focuses on human connection to secure authentic testimonials. Having a base of strong, credible reviews transforms a landing page from a sales pitch into a validated destination, which could dramatically improve the conversion rate of any future traffic you drive.",

Yes there are a lot of \"lipstick on a pig\" solutions that aren't that effective for tangible results.  We mainly see that with 19 year olds on social media flaunting rented Lambos.  However, you said it yourself OP, as long as it yields a return, who cares if it's AI?  In my experience, we keep our solutions simple and focused on mainly revenue generating activities.  AI isn't going anywhere but I'll agree that the bubble has a MAX of 2 years before it pops for sure.

I was actually pretty good at it too. Booked them 20-30 calls every month.\n\nBut they ran out of money and couldn't keep me on. So that's that.\n\nAlso broke up with my girlfriend during all this.

But honestly the thought of going back feels like I failed. Like I wasted all this time learning stuff that doesn't matter.\n\nEveryone says \"just freelance\" or \"offer your services\" but like... I have no clients, no real portfolio, no clue where to start.\n\nBeen thinking about doing free work or super cheap work just to get case studies and actually talk to people. But idk if that's the move or if it just makes me look desperate.\n\nThe frustrating part is I can build websites fast now, set up email campaigns that work, automate outreach - all this stuff that should be useful. But none of it matters if I don't have anyone to actually do it for.\n\nHas anyone been through something like this? Like a career change that just feels completely stuck?

Am I working day and night, hell yeah. Will I succeed, fuck knows but why I would give up now? And even the previous company I worked for would take me back and later they offered another two positions for other departments - I am not going to, cuz I don’t want to wake up old regretting something I didn’t do. \n\nPush it broski, I do feel like a loser, but at least I got a purpose",

I'm a mobile mechanic that started to after I lost my job. \n\nI don't have nearly any of the skills you have, I just set up a Facebook business page with some AI art for a logo and something made in Canva and just jumped on every post I could find of people needing mechanic work, took a couple easy jobs cheap just to get some reviews and while I'm still slowly building up and now working on nextdoor (you would probably go great on nextdoor, I see several people say looking for handy man, electrical, plumbing, all sorts of work). I'm flying by the seat of my pants just trying to look as professional as possible and doing good work. \n\nNow all that being said if you absolutely need cash in hand now like gonna get your ass evicted I would humble yourself, go back to the old job and get that stable check while you build yourself back up. I wouldn't think of it as failure unless you give up on trying again. \n\nI would work their while stabilizing yourself, work to keep bills and expenses to a minimum and save up for making a few years get like 3-6 months expenses fully saved up or if you can a whole year, meanwhile set up your business and start it as a side hustle where you can (I know construction usually has a lot of overtime but also sometimes you get laid off, id use the lay off time or times you don't have over time for you side hustle). Basically get reviews, get some customers in your pocket and then you have a really really stable platform to jump off of. \n\nThe first way you could make it but it's risky and you basically need to hustle like a mf to make it where the other way will take a bit longer but you'll be more stable. Just depends which way you want to go.",

We are in an industry with high insurance multipliers and expensive equipment and overhead cost.

Put in a HYSA: High Yield Saving Account so you get a higher interest (at least 3-4%) helps keep up with inflation\n\nYou're going to have to pay your own health insurance (through your state marketplace, pay attention you end up at a .gov website, private companies use a similar name. I would avoid Medicaid even if you qualify, since the government is unstable, this way you'll avoid jumping through hoops). \n\nIt could take more than a year to be profitable. Take a closer look at your job appointment contract, is there a non-compete clause? That could affect reaching out to former clients. Get into the habit of getting referrals if you're going independent. If you know someone who has done something similar reach out to them and ask questions.",

A few years ago, I was quite enthusiastic about the field, but I have reached a point where this life no longer satisfies me. You are probably wondering why... Well, a year and a half ago, I met the woman who represents me, the kind of woman I dreamed of being with, and going on voyages has become increasingly difficult. I work one month on a ship and one month at home, and I get paid 100% of the same salary for both months. At work, I started to experience anxiety and racism. I simply wake up unmotivated. I don't want to do anything, just let the days pass and go home. The food is very bad, I always have stomach problems, and I always miss home and my loved ones. For now, I have an emergency fund that will cover my expenses for about 8 months. My goal is to reach an amount that will cover 24 months of expenses and then focus on trading and another business I want to start with my girlfriend. I thought about saving some money in addition to the emergency fund for any unforeseen circumstances in the coming year. What do you think? Am I being realistic about what I want to do? Next year, I want to start that business and gradually give up my job. Do you think it's a good idea to quit even if it doesn't pay as much as my current job, even though I have my savings?",

Most people quit a job with nothing saved.\n* Trading isn't a business, it is a legal form of gambling. Investing is putting money into things for the very long term and letting natural highs and lows average out over time. Trading is guessing the highs and lows, and sometimes picking the winners, and sometimes picking the losers. Head over to r/PersonalFinance and read the hundreds of horror stories of people who blow tens of thousands in savings chasing wins \"trading\" digital currency or stocks. At least r/wallstreetbets calls it what is is... a \"bet\" aka \"gambling.\" Get that through your skull or you'll end up another broke sob story.\n* Starting a business is hard work. Other than wanting out of your sailor career, what do you know and what skills to make you successful? What kind of business are you starting? Also, if you can start it with a person who is on the short 100% of the time, is it good enough to start NOW and let them run it when you're away, and then when you're there you bust your ass for a month? Then you build up to something so that when you quit it already exists and is making money!\n* Your girlfriend is... to be blunt... your GIRLFRIEND. Not your wife (yet). The intensity of your relationship will go up immensely when you are home 100% of the time, and even moreso when you start a business together. You're putting a lot of stock into that working out, and spoiler: business with family and romantic partners often ends badly.\n\nSo... your plan as presented here kinda sucks, other than saving money.\n\n* Keep saving.\n* We all dislike our work, whether we are self employed or not... get over it.\n* Stop gambling in the markets. It isn't a business.\n* Make a plan for your business. Test your product or offering. Do market research. Perhaps start your business anyway with a partner on the shore.\n* Have some more time with your girlfriend before you upend your life for her. Don't risk ruining a good thing by tying y'all's financial future to starting a business together.",

I would specifically try to avoid you. Very common that many would act out against you. Especially in isolated workplaces like that. And when people do that, they use anything to show their frustrations with you. Which can look a lot like racism, or be misconstrued as racism. But the root cause was that you aren't pulling your own weight. Or your attitude brings people down in a job that probably needs a positive vibe.\n\nNot trying to tell you what you are experiencing.

Their first sale ever was Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies by Douglas Hofstadter, a technical cognitive-science book.\n\nWhy? Because they saw a problem in this very specific market niche. Buyers knew exactly what they wanted, but it was often hard to find these technical books at local bookstores. Amazon delivered them to you. These technical books were their beachhead.\n\nThis allowed them to prove themselves and they quickly expanded to other books, then DVDs then home goods. Now Amazon is the everything store.\n\nIf you are just starting or trying to grow your business think carefully about your market entry strategy. You can't sell to everyone at first. Find that one specific type of customer that has a very specific problem you can solve. That is your beachhead.",

They started with a specific segment: Technical nonfiction books that local stores rarely stocked, serving customers who knew exactly what they wanted and were actively searching for it. A strong beachhead targets a tightly defined group with a painful, immediate problem, one that doesn't require educating the customer and can be reached efficiently.

We used to have someone on the team doing all of that, and it would eat up hours every week.\n\nWhat’s really surprised me is how much headspace opens up once the repetitive tasks are gone. I think these “invisible” automations are the real magic of AI, making your day easier without you even noticing.\n\nCurious to see what other quirky flows or automations people are using here always find some great ideas!",

AI didn’t replace the work, it just cleared out the clutter so I could actually think again.\n\nFor example, I’ve been using ChatGPT the way you’re using it for small, purpose-built bots that keep my brain from melting. One watches competitor messaging for shifts, another cleans up client briefs so I’m not decoding chaos at 10pm, and another drafts creative angles so I never start from a blank page.\n\nI’ve also fallen in love with anything that automates the micro-tasks I used to ignore. Motion has been huge for this cause it plans my day for me based on priority and energy levels, so I actually stick to my workload instead of drowning in it. And for client acquisition, Clay has been a game changer. It scrapes, filters, personalizes, and preps outreach in minutes, so prospecting feels less like punishment.\n\nWhat’s funny is that none of these tools are flashy cause they just remove friction. And when you remove enough friction, your business suddenly feels lighter, like you’re not fighting it anymore.\n\nCurious though. Have you tried anything that automates your pipeline yet, not just your workflow?",

      "selftext": "I was broke, working in McDonalds, and desperate to break into what people call financial freedom. The idea of doing what I wanted, when I wanted, with whoever I wanted was incredibly appealing.\n\nI tried everything from trading to dropshipping to mowing lawns, but nothing worked. I was either trading my time for money or losing more money than I earned, always ending up in the negative.\n\nOne day I came across a TikTok video saying the best business to start is the one built around your hobby or interest. Something I realised later, which I think more people should understand, is that when you turn your hobby into a business you never really feel like you are working, and you end up with limitless motivation because of it.\n\nSo I started brainstorming and realised I had a valuable skill. I could go through people’s computers and find cheats or anti-forensic tricks used to hide them. This was known as PC Checking, and it was common in GTA, Minecraft and Fortnite communities.\n\nI was a checker in a few of these communities and eventually found out there were automated scanners that made the process faster and more consistent. They worked well, but they had a major flaw. False positives. Tons of them. They caused arguments, uncertainty and unresolved disputes, and the owners of these tools rarely communicated or seemed to care.\n\nBecause of that, I decided I would create a scanner myself with the lowest false positive rate possible, and I would be an active, communicative owner. That was the moment detectac was born.\n\nFirst I had to build the scanner, which took a few months with the help of my friend wirespider87. When we released it, we got no sales at all, which we expected. So I moved into the marketing stage. I partnered with Discord servers, made videos detecting the biggest bypasses at the time, and uploaded trolling cheaters on YouTube.\n\nMonth one: one sale.  \nMonth two: two sales.  \nThen it doubled every month until we hit £5k in month six.\n\nThat was the breakthrough. An extra £5k on top of my McDonalds job, but eventually the job started getting in the way, so I quit. It was the best decision I ever made. Since then I’ve kept improving detectac and today it is the market leader in PC cheat forensics, protecting over one million players across 12 different games.\n\nJust a crazy story I wanted to share to give someone a bit of motivation. It can happen to anyone if you put in enough work. Try your best, stay consistent, and you never fail if you refuse to quit.",

Going to the gym can be a slog, hence why they usually do yearly contracts they know that 80 percent of their users will use rarely because it requires effort by the user and it's not always pleasant and the payoff takes time.  Where is the barrier of use to a cleaning subscription service?  Signing up and telling someone else to clean my house everyday is a very low barrier.

          "body": "Hi!   \nFirst of all, what do you mean by happy? Because, of course, clients will say they are happy if they get your product/service for free or very cheap, but it's definitely not sustainable. \n\nI think the problem here is not with happiness. You need to understand a concept which is \"willingness to pay\". Basically, for each group of customers, how much are they willing to pay to get it? \n\nThen, consider how much it costs you to deliver this business or service and place the price between both, the willingness to pay and your costs. \n\nThis is pretty theoretical, I know. But you can start with some trial and error... what happens if you put higher prices? DO people keep showing up or do they disappear? If they disappear, you put the price too high... higher than their willingness to pay. \n\nAlso, something else to consider is to know clearly who your clients are, and to put them in groups. Like this, you can adapt to the willingness to pay of each group. \n\nFor example, let's say you are a hairdresser and each time you cut someone's hair costs you aprox. 5€ taking into account all costs. You have 2 groups of people coming to your place: students and workers. Students are willing to pay up to 8€ while workers can pay up to 10. If you put the price at 8€, you will be loosing money with the workers but if you put it at 10€, the students will not come. \n\nSo, the best option is probably to create a special offer where, if someone shows they student card, they get the service for 8€ and if not, they have to pay the full price (10€). Like this you get the highest possible incoming while delivering the service at a price clients are willing to pay...\n\n  \nIf this was useful, consider giving me an upvote, as I am just starting on reddit and it really helps!\n\nAnd if you would like to work with me as a mentor to analyse your case with more detail, you can book a free first call here: [calendly.com/juliadelatorre\\_consultant/30min](http://calendly.com/juliadelatorre_consultant/30min)\n\nWorst case scenario, you get an outside view of your project...

I went into his account to get some documents he didn't share with me and noticed there was a \"secret\" chat with a few other people on it. \n\nFound out my team had been talking about me behind my back and commenting lude things about a female employee and saying really crappy things about their team members. I don't care what people say about me, but the things they said about their team members set me off.\n\nThe person leading the charge was my first hire. Felt a bit like a dagger in the back. I ultimately drove two of the main people causing the ruckus out of the business as they thought I \"needed\" them. I did not...\n\nI ended up having to have the hardest talk of my life with these three other young guys who ended up being caught up in the moment. These guys turned around and showed my why they deserved to be there. I was impressed how they handled themselves going forward and showed me they deserved my respect.\n\nIt gave me confidence that I could handle any situation, but also that I was really freaking anxious to have this conversation. It was a growing moment for everyone. But challenging these individuals made them show me they had what it takes. \n\nWe had a group meeting. I left it with them to tell me they wanted to be here and gave them a deadline of 24 hours to show me they have what it takes and to think long and hard about who they want to be.\n\nWhat was the toughest conversation you've ever had?

He turned into someone completely different, never helped with anything and I was sick of it. I finally got him to agree on selling the business and parting ways and it was delay after delay. “One more push to get our profits up so we can sell for more”. That never stopped and finally he said I don’t want to sell anymore. I said f it, and asked for his terms for me to exit. I have no regrets. Outside of the partnership being a disaster dealing with employee BS, complete gut punches anytime there was a negative review, things seeming like they are going great and getting hit with a shit pile. I couldn’t do it anymore. I tried doing it differently, I tried sticking it out, I tried new methods of communication, I tried everything. \n\nWhat I am grateful for is I went through severe burnout for the first year and mapped out everything I was spending time on, started journaling and meditating and these two things alone changed my life for the better. I was able to manage the shit storm of the small business, but ultimately saw no end in sight. I know social media makes it seem like you should never quit, keep going, grind it out, it will get better. Sure maybe. But also it might not. What’s your piece of mind worth? I lost money, but guess what? before I stopped I was losing money, my time, and my peace of mind. So I decided I only wanted to lose money moving forward. \n\nWill I start another business? Yes, but it will be under my terms and with more clarity. If you feel like you’re never moving forward it’s ok to stop. Chances are you’ve learned a shit ton, and can takeaway some great things from the experience as I did. \n\nIt’s ok to step away. You didn’t fail, you learned. This is not advice to quit but rather determine whether or not it’s time to move on or change how things are going. \n\nHope you can take your life back one way or another. The only thing I urge you to do is start meditating, journaling, and mapping out your time.",

Then I learned one of the simplest and, at the same time, the hardest things to do.   \n  \nDELEGATE.   \n  \nDelgating relieves stress, let's you do so much more in a day, gives you more time to actually work ON the busines not IN the business.\n\nNow you might say, I don't have the money to pay someone or the time to train someone. I understand. \n\nHowever, you CAN delegate through systems even while it's just you. \n\nI've also heard people say \"well you know, we can start working on systems when I'm big enough and have a whole team, etc.\" \n\nI'll tell you from years and years of experience, that's the wrong type of thinking. \n\nSystems include everything from how you start your day, to how you end it.   \n\n* Could be as simple as a customer request system to manage issues.  \n* Could be a checklist to ensure that things are done correctly the first time so it's not an issue later.  \n* Could be scheduling your day and week around which day you will troubleshoot and which day you will sell or work on new projects. \n\nIf you are experiencing the same types of issues all the time, you absolutely **must** build a system around ensuring those issues don't keep happening. \n\nIf you are willing to do that, I promise the burnout feeling will start to go away. THEN, you can hire someone to manage the checklists you've built to ensure that these issues don't happen and when something new happens, it goes into that checklist for next time. \n\nMost people run their businesses like they are self-employed.   \n  \nI want you to keep this in mind going forward:   \n  \n**Your success, or lack thereof, is a direct result of the limitations you impose on yourself.** \n\nEnvision what you want you day to look like, then actually build your life around it. \n\nYou can start by fixing ONE recurring problem each day.   \n  \nBy the end of the week, you will be surprise in how much you can turn things around.\n\nDo this for 30 days, and your life will positively change in ways you wouldn't have thought possible.",

They think once they get to 6 figures they are rich and doing well.\n\nIt's easy to make 6/7 figures through a business. The difficulty is not losing money to tax or expensive things you don't need like holidays.\n\nThe reality of money is once you believe you are doing well there almost certainly is somebody else doing better than you. When I look at things in 4 figures cost like 1k-10k I still question if I can afford it. \n\nMost people on social media show a lifestyle that really isn't normal. Maybe some are ultra wealthy, but I very often think they are in large amounts of debt. Honestly, the richest people tend to not show their wealth because you just set yourself up to be robbed. \n\nI believe ultra wealth is maybe 10 million +, but if I am really honest at my age, you could burn through that fairly quickly with lifestyle inflation.\nRecently, I took a drop in income and an on 8k a month I am spending like 12k a month and I am rushing through money fast.

      "selftext": "For a while now we have been removing \"pain points\" market research posts under certain circumstances. We are going to be expanding this rule because of the continuous onslaught of people trying to use our subscribers as an unpaid market research group. That isn't the point of the sub and the ease of creating AI wrappers or vibe coding apps has made it so bad the noise from these posts are blocking out real questions about small business. \n\nThis is particularly annoying given anyone can look at our past posts and create a map of what is important or challenging for small businesses with far greater accuracy than a single spammy \"question\" post.\n\n- Research on small businesses (i.e. asking what their challenges are, if XYZ app will help, how good your small business offering is, etc.) will be removed unless posted by legitimate academic sources. Additional rules will apply for academic research.\n\n- Posts of this type will be allowed as comments in one of our stickied posts. If these comments engage widely we may set up a new sticky for them.\n\n- We still only allow questions to be posted. Mods may post or enable non-questions for specific purposes. These are generally PSAs but can be about critical events.\n\n- As before, posts directly or indirectly for promotion will be removed, including those authored by AI. Using AI to translate might be OK but AI slop is not.\n\nAs always we welcome feedback on the rule change. \n\nAs a separate note, you might like to know we've been operating several posts as anti-spammer honeypots. These are posts are popular but highly attractive to spammers. The posts are under continuous monitoring and when a spammer makes their comment the company name or offer is banned universally across the sub. Banning the company name means even different accounts can't spam us with it. Feel free to tell folks we operate honeypots. If the bad guys know there is a risk to posting here perhaps they'll send the spam somewhere else.\n\nThanks for your posts and I look forward to hearing your comments - even the critical ones - as we always have room to improve.\n",

His faculties were slipping but not enough that any of us noticed yet. \n\nThey loaned him $120,000 with a ridiculous APR and weekly automatic withdrawals. If a payment didn't go through they'd call right away and threaten him (not that any of the threats were legal). My dad mostly ignored them but it still took a toll. \n\nWe're all stepping in now to shut down his business and bank accounts. We've notified the company that he's no longer able to pay but they keep calling and sending notices. My dad is gonna have to declare bankruptcy anyways so I figure they can just keep wasting their breath but other people in my family get real anxious about it. My sister even sent them a payment to \"shut them up\" ... Which worked for about a week.\n\nAll this said... I have to imagine a lot of these loans end up in bankruptcy so I'm not sure how the business works. They got back maybe $30k in payments from my dad. I don't think there will be much for them to sink their teeth into if they file a claim on the bankruptcy either.",

Not sure which scam this is. Could just be a generally terrible loan with bad terms no one in their right mind would agree to. If it’s a standard advanced fee scam. “You’ve been approved for this loan, but we need 10% up front as a guarantee. We take bitcoin/giftcards!”\n\nAlso, of course, they’ll need all of your personal information for credit check purposes and whatnot. On the back end they will sell this info to other scammers who will use it to make themselves seem legit. “Is this First Name Last Name from X Address? I have a warrant for your arrest!”. You fell for one scam, so you’re a proven mark. You’ll get plenty of calls trying to scam you again. “Is this FN LN?

I started this small travel agency a couple years back, nothing crazy, but it somehow worked and I made like 70k over time. As I started making money I also started traveling a lot, just seeing the world, learning stuff… one of those trips was to Kenya.Someone I met there took me to this Hass avocado farm. I swear I didn’t even care about farming before but something about that place stuck with me. The trees, the export thing, the whole operation… don’t know why but it hit me.\nBefore that I was just doing the travel agency thing, but then the whole model started getting copied everywhere and abused. Margins dropped, everything felt off, so I shut it down before it ate everything I worked for.When I got back home I kept reading about Hass avocados nonstop. Like for two years. Everything from seedlings to climate stuff to yields and prices. Deep rabbit hole.Then I found some land in Ethiopia that fit everything I learned and I bought it. Honestly that moment felt wild, like “damn… this is mine.”And now I’m kinda just sitting here thinking, ok… what’s the actual next move?\nIt’s weird going from a travel agency to avocado farming. Didn’t expect life to go this direction at all.Anyone else ever make a complete switch like this?How do you know if you’re moving smart or just chasing something because it felt right in the moment?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated",

But i'd personally create a nice and memorable brand. Maybe even a funny brand. Brand all of my shipping containers. Maybe add branded stickers on every avocado. And if business goes well keep reinvesting and expanding.

Not sure how hard it is to press it or what the margins are, but that could be a play for you. \n\nYou also might partner with a current export firm or a distribution partner, and work-out a revenue share by co packing or branding / licensing play. Get some bottles, simple label maker, and put their name and logo on...have them ship and sell, u just grow and produce. \n\nContact all of your prior relationships from your travel agency, such as the destinations, hotels, chefs, restaurants etc and ask them if you can send a small sample to test if they like the product and speed to destinations/ costs... maybe put 20 in a box and send them out to gage logistical issues... \n\nBeing agri product, there prob needs to be permits licensed and approved steps and stamps fro. UsDA for example... \n\nOil might be an easier play the actual produce but I could be wrong on that...\n\nIf going organic, there is a way you can apply to get permit and seal of approval, most likely from USDA as well If shipping to UsA ...\n\nJust things that are coming to mind here.... \n\nGood luck and hope it goes well for you!",

I can produce a better doc in a few hours than most can in a couple of days, does that mean I deserve to get paid for 2 hours instead of 16, especially given what I've done is better?\n\nIt also doesn't reward proper time / capability management. I work better when I'm rested and in the mood, and can demonstrably do a days work in a few hours when the circumstances are perfect. So I have no qualms about billing a day even if I didn't work 8 hours, if the thing I produced in the hours I did work are worthy of a typical days work.\n\nHourly billing effectively punishes good people and rewards lesser skilled or just outright slower ones, especially when you start micro-managing it and everything becomes about 'what you produced' during that time. Not every hour has an output.\n\nThe real questions are, are you happy with the work you got for the amount you paid? Does this designer always deliver on time, or are things running behind? Are there quality issues?\n\nIt sounds like they're knocking it out of the park, and your only annoyance is that she's not scratching away on an art pad every second of day.\n\nThere is of course a difference between not 'working' every hour, and actually claiming for time they're not even remotely working, and you should make sure you're happy with what's being billed...but if you're not sure how to feel about it, then fall back on \"am I happy with what I got for what I paid\", and forget how that looks from a timesheet point of view.\n\nIf it's really bothering you, you should move to have your designer work more as a freelancer and quote for the work. This way, she gets to spend as little or as much time on it as she needs to, and you're paying a price your happy with. Be prepared to be charged a premium for it, however.",

If that's the case, it makes sense to me to go back to fixed contract and just pay for her to do certain projects and that's it. If the work is good, great. If the work isn't good, find a new designer. \n\nTrying to track her hours seems like a major pain in the butt. But as for your current situation, if you can prove that she didn't work during the hours she claimed, then no you shouldn't pay it. But if she chooses to file a lawsuit or a claim with your state Department of Labor (assuming you are US based), then you better be prepared to have proof that she didn't work those hours. Otherwise it is your word against hers and you will be dealing with a major headache of fighting it and then ultimately having to pay her anyway. So it may be worth it to pay her to avoid potential headaches. \n\nBut moving forward, you need to come up with a different system. I mean if you feel your designer has been slacking, it's probably time to move on. And let's face reality here. If she's slacking AND you are fighting with her about hours she's working or not working, she's probably got one foot out the door anyway and you'll have to find someone else soon enough regardless. \n\nSo my advice is unless you can definitively prove she wasn't working when she claims she was, is just pay her to avoid the headache and go find a new designer.",

I’ve never had a client behave like this and I don’t have a mentor to run this by.\n\n**The Context:**\n\n* I have a client who started construction **before** the building permit was issued. He is currently panicked because he’s risking a Stop Work Order or worse.\n* The City review process has been frustrating. The reviewer used generic \"boilerplate\" comments and didn't mark up/redline the reports, just the plans. This ambiguity caused a 3rd review cycle.\n* The City charged a re-submittal fee. It is **$150**.\n\n**The Conflict:**\n\n* The Client is demanding I pay this $150 fee out of my own pocket.\n* My contract (and industry standard) states that all agency/permit fees are the Owner's responsibility.\n* I am currently fighting the City to waive the fee on his behalf because I agree the review was lazy, but I told the Client I will not pay it personally if the waiver is denied.\n\n**The Behavior:**\n\n* He is texting me \"???\" late at night.\n* He told me \"I’m a businessman, I know how this works,\" and accused me of \"not taking ownership\" because I won't pay the $150.\n* **He has threatened to sue me.**\n\n**My Position:** I feel like he is projecting his anxiety about his illegal construction onto me. He wants me to pay the fee to validate his narrative that the delays are my fault, not the City's or his own. I’m holding the line on the $150 not because of the money, but because paying it feels like an admission of guilt/liability.\n\nHas anyone dealt with a client like this? Am I wrong for refusing to pay a small fee just to make him shut up, given that he’s already threatened legal action?\n\n**TL;DR:** Client building illegally is trying to bully me into paying a $150 City fee and threatening to sue. I'm standing my ground.",

She was pretty mad at me and I fully understand here I just don't know the reason behind me being like this\n\nI grew up pretty broke and bootstrapped this thing on like 3k and now even though we're profitable and growing I still operate like we're one expense away from shutting down. I review our business checking account basically every day. I still use a personal card for a bunch of business expenses because I feel guilty putting them on the company card even though that makes no sense whatsoever\n\nMy partner thinks I should talk to a therapist about it which honestly might not be a bad idea but I'm also super curious if anyone else deals with this? Like at what revenue point did you stop feeling like every dollar going out was a personal attack? Or does it never go away?\n\nThe ironic thing is I'm probably COSTING us money by being so cheap since we're definitely underinvesting in tools and people because I'm too anxious about everything?

In order to grow, you should be expected to invest a certain amount back into your company. \n\nFor me, I had to work hard to change my mindset on money. Budgeting was a huge help. I committed that a % of profits would be set aside for a rainy day, and a % would be invested in our continued growth. Whether it’s hiring people, adding to our tech stack, training, etc. \n\nThat has helped as I have a set number to work with - and from there I prioritize investing in things based on the expected ROI. For example, If I add a tool for our team that saves everyone a few hours every week in admin work, they can spend that time doing something that helps our company elsewhere - like more work tied to revenue generation. If I hire someone that I can delegate tactical work to, it frees me up to me a multiplier for the company and focus on sales. \n\nIt doesn’t mean I spend like crazy, but it really helped me having a set budget in the early days that was specifically tied to investing in our growth. \n\nGood luck!",

Since you're suffering with expenses, what tool are you using? We have Ramp integrated within our company for expenses/cards which definitely helped since everything's automatic (automatic matching receipt and you can issue cards to everyone including yourself so that you can follow all the expenses way easier)\n\nAlso your partner is right about the software btw. That $20/month probably saves way more than that in wasted time. At 40k MRR after 18 months you're doing amazing!!

Organic growth through word-of-mouth and social content is great for validation, but it caps your growth at the speed people naturally share - which is slow and inconsistent.\n\n\n\nYour question about \"how to get customers fast\" reveals the core tension: fast customer acquisition requires paid distribution. You can't manufacture urgency and demand at scale without putting your offer in front of targeted audiences systematically. Facebook and Google ads let you control exactly who sees your cookies and when.\n\n\n\nStart with $10-15/day on Facebook ads targeting your local area with a simple offer: \"Handmade cookies delivered today in \\[your town\\]. Order by 2pm.\" Use photo carousel ads showing your actual cookies, not stock imagery. The algorithm will find people who click and convert within 3-5 days.\n\n\n\nThe mistake most food businesses make is waiting until they have \"perfect\" branding or enough inventory. Start running small test budgets now to learn what messaging works, then scale when you have capacity. Spending $300-500 in your first month will teach you more about customer acquisition than 6 months of organic posting.",

It recently became my responsibility to reconcile the UPS invoice we get weekly and it has become clear that UPS is essentially scamming us out of hundreds of dollars a week. I wanted to see if others have been having the same experience. \n\nWe are being hit with two surcharges mainly: “dimensional weight adjustments” &amp; “address corrections”. These sometimes amount to more than the original cost of the shipment, are often not valid and easily disputed, and feel very much like UPS attempting to skim money from businesses that are shipping enough to not be able to catch these additional fees. \n\nWhen speaking with our account executive, she mentions that they use an automated (I assume AI) system to image and measure packages. I’ve asked for proof from this system on a few occasions for dimensional adjustments and received nothing, but have had disputes accepted instead. She also has mentioned that the team that handles the surcharges is “third party and overseas”, which makes me think they are receiving a portion of these surcharges, incentivizing them to overcharge and not accept disputes. \n\nAnyway, just want to know if this is a common issue others who use UPS for 30+ shipments a week are experiencing.

      "selftext": "On paper, this should be simple: show the client the results, they see the value, and they agree to move off the discount. That’s how it usually goes. But I’m dealing with a client who originally came to me skeptical about GBP-focused SEO for his massage therapy business. To ease him in, I offered a discounted rate with the clear agreement that once we showed movement, we’d switch to standard pricing. The results ended up being better than either of us expected; his visibility shot up, leads increased, and everything was trending in the right direction.\n\nBut when I brought the pricing conversation back up, he basically said, “Why pay more if what we’re doing now works?” Which is frustrating, because we clearly agreed the discount was temporary. I’m torn between dropping him, keeping him at the lower rate, or trying again to get him to honor the original plan. I’ve explained that competing with the top players requires more resources, but I’m not sure if it’s getting through. I’m curious what others would do: should I cut the client, stick with the current rate, or push harder for the rate adjustment?",

      "selftext": "So my family's been looking at purchasing a second business. Its a reputable gas station franchise, newly established. Its a suburban area and the area has a population around 35,000 (2.5 mile radius) and nearby metropolitan city above 500k. It's near an intersection of 2 interstate highways, right off of the exit of one of them. \n\nI've been looking through the financials for the past couple of weeks, going through their franchise approval, meeting with the owners, etc and here's the basic gist of what I am expecting to get in terms of profits. \n\nThey are average in total of 123k in merchandise sales monthly. They're able to keep a 35-40% profit margin, I am getting 40% gross profit, but lets say 35%. So they're keeping roughly $43,050. The franchise takes 25% cut, leaving them with $32,288. They have 12 pumps running and are getting roughly 7,000 in their share from the franchise (franchise gives 0.05 cents on the gallon). So in a month they're grossing 39,288 before expenses. Now adding the expenses; labor (15k), card processing (3.5k), utilities (3k), operational supplies (1.4k), maintenance/repair/yard (2.8k), misc. (2k). One thing to mention is rent is really low. The location is really nice, great for a gas station traffic wise, not any nearby gas stations, but since the franchise owns the building, they say their model is to keep the rent low, so only $2,600. In that area a business like that, rent are up almost as much as 10k. So in an average month I can see myself able to keep 18k give or take. \n\nSo this is most of the information on that business I am wanting to put an offer up for. The sellers are asking $700k plus inventory. What are your guy's thoughts? Obviously I've done my research but wanting to ask from real people now.  \n\n",

Is the store at a corner?  If so, is the corner a signalized intersection?  How many and what size are the curb cuts or access into the property?  Is the property large enough to add a drivethru window or CarWash?

The franchise is taking too much of the profit from inside and motor fuel sales, so they charge a below-market rental rate.  The store pumps about 140,000 gallons per month, depending on the market, this should generate 15-20 cents per gallon gross profit before credit card/transaction fees.",

This depends a lot on the area however - I'd expect more rural areas to stay gasoline-heavy for longer.\n\nIf you owned the land, I'd also be wary of having to pay the cleanup costs of removing all those underground tanks. Make sure this isn't on you to do if the business eventually ceases operating - it can cost six figures to do this.\n\nMy biggest concern is the rent. You have an amazing deal right now but do you have guarantees that they won't increase the rent by more than X% a year? If they make the rent reset to market rates, this whole deal isn't very good.\n\nAre there major repairs that need to be done? Check especially the condition of the tanks.\n\nThe labor costs seem low but I am in a state with a high minimum wage. Is this place running 24 hour?\n\nAre there opportunities for complementary businesses in the future? e.g. a car wash or a uhaul franchise?\n\nOverall though, the numbers look good ($700K for roughly $200K a year return) and everything passes the gut check.",

So say you’re grossing $20k/month (which is the right answer btw, your labour should go against direct expenses thus making your gross $24k/month),  \n\nGiven what you’ve said about the business, I would apply some nominal percent discount, I would say somewhere around 5%-10%. Wouldn’t pay more than $265,000\n\nThe other thing to consider is your labour. Are you going to be working there, or are you going to need to hire? What was your calculations on the 15k labour? If you are going to work, how many years are you expecting to do that, are you anticipating purchasing another gas station? All this should go into factoring your personal valuation for this business. \n\nAs for inventory, what is the inventory value? What was their inventory shrinkage last year? If you have a couple years of fiscal data, take the average of the last 3 years of inventory shrinkage and discount their inventory. \n\nAll being said, this business is netting around 10%, so a healthy business. Last thing I would check; what’s the nearest station, are your prices higher or lower, and what’s their proximity to major roads (freeways, etc.). If there’s opportunity to gain business then your discount as mentioned above changes.\n\nEDIT: 10% net is not taking into account owners expenses currently. Your real net, EBITDA, should be higher than 10% (at least I guess).",

I learned a lot about setting expectations with employees for next year to avoid this specific issue and other issues we had throughout the season (mostly pertaining to wage and drive time - which mostly comes back to me having bad planning and being bad setting expectations).\n\nI am a small business owner of a seasonal business. I just hired my first employee this year to help me. In the ad I put up on Craigslist, I mentioned there would be about 28-30 working days at a rate of $200 per day with a $1,000 bonus at the end of the year if he stayed with me the entire year.\n\nMy employee is excellent so I bumped him up to $220 per day with a few days of $300 and $360. Now we are getting toward the end of the season and I am realizing I can finish the remaining 7 work days on my own and there isn’t enough work to justify having an employee for those days. I would be losing out on about $1,500 by keeping him around but at the same time I feel obligated to keep him working because although there is no contract, I feel that I committed to the full season with him and I should just eat the cost and chalk it up as a learning experience.\n\nMy decision is between cutting him loose early and still paying him the $1000 bonus or keeping him on and eating the unnecessary cost of $1500.\n\nHas anyone been thru similar experiences?

I’m obviously not familiar with your business but as a small business owner of 25 years and 26 employees we’ve found that it’s been best practice to try and keep our staff and keep them tenured rather than rehiring . The opportunity costs in our business are pretty significant when it comes to training and getting staff up to speed. Our average staff tenure is going on 16 years, with some well above 20-25 years and you can’t overestimate the contribution made by experienced and well trained staff to the point we find things for them to do during slow periods just to keep them on even if some of it is low priority plus flexible work schedules and enhanced benefits. We’ve never done any sort of analysis but I suspect it costs us a lot more to train a new staff member anywhere from $10-15k per employee, compared to rewarding our experienced tenured staff a portion of this through quarterly and year end bonus. We just had two employees return after leaving the company in 2019 and 2022 and both were at least a year ahead of new staff members hired roughly the same time. Lots of opportunity costs when it comes to finding and training in our business. We will do almost anything, with reason to hold onto good talent. Not sure how hard this is for your business and industry. Keeping staff loyal has made our company what it is today which I’d say is modestly successful with year over year growth and the opportunity to increase revenue and profitability. I’m also a push over when it comes to these sorts of things but it has worked for us. The few new hires we have made end up being 50/50 in terms of their abilities and commitment but once we find someone we will try and do everything possible to keep them even if it costs us money in the short run. Sorry if we are comparing apples to oranges but I can’t emphasize just how important it has been for us to keep smart, hard working and loyal employees on staff rather than trying to replace them. During the pandemic when our business basically went from $16-17 mill in average revenue to literally $0 for about 2 years , we continued paying everyone a modified but liveable salary and we went millions 2 million into debt even with getting 2 forgivable PPP loan for almost $1 mill total, but we’re able to quickly retire that debt after 2 years whereas we’d still be pay that off if we had to restart with new hires or mostly new hires. I think doing the right thing when it comes to keeping promises has never been more important. Good luck and I hope you figure it out.",

I make a lot more than I did when I worked in finance.  I generally have a lot of free time and don't work 40 hours a week (I probably work about 10 to 15 hours).  On paper it's ideal.  But, even then, it's still stressful.  Mistakes get made.  Clients get demanding.  Employees are in a bad mood.  \n\nI have a key employee that is going to move out of state in about 6 months.  I actually bought his business in 2020.  He was supposed to train me to run it, but that never really happened.  Instead, he continued to work here and, despite my best efforts, sort of continued to run that part of the business somewhat separately.  I've never really gotten the two companies to be one cohesive unit.  It's really frustrating.  I knew this guy was not the best communicator, but it's been a lot worse than I thought it would be.\n\nNow he plans to leave.  I still owe him over $100,000 and I feel like he hasn't held up his end of our contract at all.  The three guys that were his employees (and are now my employees) are not really able to work without his constant guidance.  I know the wheels are going to come off that portion of the business once he is gone.  I have a feeling all three of his guys will quit.  It's not the end of the world since I don't think any of them are that great.  But still, I know it is going to be stressful.  \n\nThe past few days I have been wondering if I should just shut the entire business down next summer.  My husband says I should sell it, and logically I know that is probably what I should do.  I had a good business for 4 years before I bought this second company.  That portion of the company will still be good and runs well.  It's also quite profitable on its own.  But, man, I am just tired right now... A large part of me just wants to walk away.  But I also have no idea what I would do with myself if I didn't have the business to run.  ",

      "selftext": "I've been absolutely consumed by short form content for the past two years. Like might legitimately need help levels of consumed. I'm talking 12 hour days dissecting viral videos, testing hooks, redoing scripts, experimenting with editing techniques, the entire process.\n\nWhy? Because I'm convinced short form dictates the future of everything. Marketing, building audiences, moving products, generating opportunities, it all depends on whether you can grab someone's attention for 30 seconds.\n\nBut here's what almost made me quit: despite working every single day, nothing was hitting. I'd spend 6 hours on a video just to watch it flatline at 300 views. Tried every approach from every guru. Bought courses. Followed \"battle-tested frameworks.\" Still stuck.\n\nI was genuinely starting to think some people just have it and I don't. Like maybe I was born without the viral gene or something.\n\nThen I had this moment where it clicked, I'm working hard, but I'm working blind. I don't actually know what's wrong. I'm just guessing and hoping.\n\nSo I stopped trying to crack some hidden viral code and started measuring actual numbers. Analyzed my last 50 videos frame by frame, monitored every single dropout point, and found 6 patterns that kept demolishing my retention:\n\n1. Generic openers are completely invisible. \"You need to see this...\" gets skipped instantly. But \"Doing 100 squats daily made my knees sound weird\" stops the scroll dead. Specificity beats mystery.\n\n2. Second 5 is the real decision point. Most people bail between 4-7 seconds if you haven't proven it's worth watching. I was building suspense like a moron. Now I hit them with my strongest visual or stat right at second 5. That's your actual hook.\n\n3. Any silence past 1 second kills you. Seriously measured this, anything beyond 1.2 seconds and people think the video is broken. What feels like natural pacing to you comes across as \"boring\" to someone scrolling. Cut way tighter than feels normal.\n\n4. Visual changes matter more than anything. If your footage stays identical for more than 3 seconds, people zone out. I started switching camera angles, adding b roll, shifting text placement, anything to create visual movement. Went from losing 50% at the midpoint to keeping 70%.\n\n5. Analyze your videos and learn from their feedback. This is one of the things that helped me the most. I use an app called TikAlyzer that gives me feedback about my videos and tells me how to improve them so I can get more views.\n\n6. Rewatch rate is way more important than most think. Content people watch twice gets pushed significantly harder. Started including rapid text that's easy to miss, faster cuts, tiny details you catch on second viewing. Rewatch rate went from 8% to 31% and views exploded.\n\nHonestly the biggest shift was stopping the guessing game and actually tracking what was happening second by second. Went from 300 average views to 15k in about 3 weeks.\n\nIf you're posting regularly but can't break 1k views, it's not that your content sucks, you just don't understand what's actually working vs what you assume is working.\n\nLook, I'm sharing this because cracking the algorithm was genuinely one of the hardest things I've done. I really wish someone had just broken down exactly what I needed to fix back then. Would've saved me months of frustration and self doubt. So I'm doing that now for whoever needs to hear it.",

      "selftext": "I started a business when I was very young and still at school. \nLong story short, the business started making some money and growing. My uncles then decided for me that I need capital to grow the business, so they gave me a loan. \nThe loan, not an investment, needed to be paid back first before any dividends and they took 60% of my company. \nI was so young, I didn’t really know anything and my parents agreed to the deal. My parents know nothing about business.\nSo, uncles took 60%, I kept 30% and my parents have 10%. \nThe money went to building software that was complete crap and added no value. The business is successful, but all thanks to me. They do give some good advice though. \nAs I’ve grown up, I’ve just learned and learned how bad this deal was and I’ve grown up with such resentment. But, I was always too scared to bring this up, as I didn’t want the family the have a falling out. \nI even have to rent the office from my uncle. \nSo, once when I was 20, I wanted to move offices to somewhere neutral, but I was told “No, because then we won’t be involved and help you”.\nI then brought up 5 years ago that I want to buy shares back and they thought I was greedy. Now 5 years later, last week, I brought it up again that I want to buy some shares. \nThey told me that they can never understand what I’m angry about. In the real world, when people are desperate for money, they would handle “far worse prostitution”, and that I got a good deal and that I need to do some soul searching and see that what I’ve been feeling is wrong and that I actually lucked out. \nThe thing is, I wasn’t desperate, I didn’t even WANT it. I never asked for the loan. \n\nThey asked me to go ask “real investors” of the world about the deal and see that I’m wrong about my feelings that I got the short end of the stick.\n\nSo, as part of the research, I’m asking the real investors of reddit. \n\nI don’t think anyone will agree that this is a fair deal. And I’ve approached some lawyers to help me navigate this, but, in the meantime, for my “soul searching”, please can you give me unbiased opinions, did I get a good deal?\n\nCan anyone give me some similar scenarios?",

Then propose a **structured** pathway: e.g., a staged buy-back at independently-valued prices; or converting part of their holding into non-voting equity; or refinancing their loan with a bank/third party so the company isn’t commercially dependent on them; or formalising their “involvement” as an advisory role paid at market, rather than enforced via share control and tenancy. If the relationship matters, a mediator who understands family businesses can help keep it from becoming a moral trial.",

I saw the need to bring in help with bookkeeping, contracts, financials, etc…  This ended up being a “friend” that spoke a good game and insisted on being a 50/50 partner- which never was put on paper. I ultimately showed a flaw in my decision making by putting too much trust in him. Basically giving free range to all things and everything when it comes to money. So much so that I did not monitor anything regarding anything financial. Long story made short, I now have two maxed out credit cards, lots of questionable deposits and very unfair disbursements. Just a major problem with my poor decision making in letting him have that much power in MY company. \n\nI’ll be approaching him soon with all my findings but I want to make sure I protect myself from any further and future damage as he has all access to everything financial on me. I know to freeze accounts and deny purchase permissions. \n\nBut is there any program out there that gives alerts or guards against fraud? I wouldn’t put it past him to plaster my ssn all over the internet for scammers to grab. ",

Unless your \"friend\" can come up with the money, or has assets to liquidate when/IF you win a lawsuit, I would not spend another dime on him.  Do not hire an attorney, do not hire a forensic accountant, do not throw any more money at this guy in any way, shape or form... unless you have to!\n\nConsider this an expensive lesson in owning and operating a small business and move on.  Cut the cords, the ropes, the locks, access to systems, portals, cards, phones, clients, etc.\n\nDevelop an email that gracefully dismisses him from representing your business and get ready to send it immediately after you cut him off as the leech that he is.  You will get some blow back - but once he realizes you have cut him off at every pass, he'll probably go find some other person to scam and leave you alone... Unless he has the money to waste on tormenting you.  That would be the only reason to find an absolute ball busting aggressive asshole of an attorney.  It'll cost you - but the job will get done.\n\nFinally, surviving as a small business owner in the USA today is not anything like it was 20-30 years ago.  Whatever illusions you have of fairness, righteousness, loyalty - get rid of it now. No one is going to fight harder than you to survive and win at this game called \"America\". It's a dirty, disgusting situation. In the end, there is a high probability one of you will be filing bankruptcy.  Make sure it's not you!",
