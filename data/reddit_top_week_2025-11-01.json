      "selftext": "Ever make money purely by accident? That’s exactly how my first sale from a random keyword went down.\n\nI remember just aimlessly scrolling Etsy one evening, and bam, 'AI journal' started subtly appearing more often. It was totally off-script. On a whim, I fired up Canva, hastily designed a basic digital template, put 'AI prompts' on the cover, hit publish, and logged off. I didn't give it another thought.\n\nWoke up the next morning and “cha-ching”, a sale. I couldn't believe it.\n\nThat minuscule sale was a profound wake-up call. It felt infinitely more satisfying than any elaborate scheme I'd meticulously crafted. No advertising, no aggressive marketing, no sophisticated funnel. Just perfect timing. I'd inadvertently caught a nascent trend before it swelled.\n\nAnd then, a few weeks later, it happened again. This time the keyword was 'coquette bow.' I'll be honest, I didn't even personally like that whole aesthetic, but people were absolutely losing their minds over it. So I just whipped up a few pastel prints, chucked them online, and literally forgot they existed. And boom, they sold too.\n\nAnd that, my friends, was the big 'aha!' moment. I'd spent months (probably years, honestly) torturing myself trying to be 'original,' constantly chasing ideas that literally no one was even asking for. But the money? It only showed up when I finally stopped guessing and just started actually paying attention to what people were already searching for.\n\nThese days, my time is way better spent just observing, seeing what people are saving, what they're searching for, what they're chatting about, rather than trying to brainstorm some brilliant new thing from scratch. And honestly? It's wildly freeing.\n\nSo yeah, that tiny 'AI journal' sale taught me the biggest lesson of all: the internet doesn't give a damn about who's the smartest or most 'original.' It pays the person who just shows up first, period.\n\nEver have a 'dumb' idea that made money, while your 'genius' projects flopped?",

I wanted to have a legit photography session done for them, but it was too expensive for this particular style of photography. \n\nAfter searching online with no luck, I decided I could edit the photo to look like that myself. Once it was done, it looked exactly like I had it professionally taken in a studio and it only took me about 15 mins. Once I understood the process it took just a few minutes to do an edit. \n\nI made a listing on Etsy for that type of photo editing for $25 per photo. I didn’t think anything else about it. Until I got a sale. Then I started getting sales all the time. Sometimes 5 or 6 per day, especially near holidays. \n\nA giant Etsy store jacked my idea and once they were promoting it, there was no more business for my little shop. But it was a super random but successful side hustle for about a year.",

That’s it.\n\nIt wasn’t fancy, but it solved one pain point: “Where do I start?”\n\nAnd people paid for that clarity.\n\nStep 2: Make your content look professional (without hiring anyone)\n\nThis was the key: I realized presentation matters. People buy what looks valuable.\n\nBut I didn’t want to spend hundreds on filming or models.\n\nSo I experimented with a few tools that let you create realistic human visuals. I used them to make lifestyle-style visuals and short explainer clips for my digital product.\n\nIt made my brand look way more trustworthy, even though it was just me behind the screen.\n\nStep 3: Focus on one platform &amp; post consistently\n\nI picked TikTok (because organic reach is still good in 2025).\n\nMy content formula was:\n\n· 3 videos per week\n\n· Each one showing a piece of the process (“how I made my first sale”, “what I learned about pricing”, etc.)\n\n· CTA: “Free checklist link in bio”\n\nNo editing team, no paid ads — just showing small progress each week.\n\nStep 4: Monetize through simple upgrades\n\nOnce I got traction, I added two things:\n\n1.A “premium” version of the guide with templates and extra walkthroughs ($19)\n\n2.A small group for Q&amp;A support ($15/month)\n\nTogether, that brought me to \\~$2K/month in 3 months.\n\nNot crazy numbers, but real and consistent.\n\nStep 5: Things that helped me most\n\n· Don’t wait to look perfect. Post even if your setup is basic.\n\n· Pick one product and one platform, don’t scatter your attention.\n\n· Recycle content: one visual → three clips → carousel post → blog.\n\n· Use AI tools to save time, not replace creativity.\n\n· Talk to your early buyers. They’ll tell you what version 2 should be.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe online income space is loud right now, but there’s still room for small, thoughtful creators who actually help people.\n\nYou don’t need to build an agency or code a SaaS. Sometimes it’s just:\n\nidentify a pain point, make something useful, present it well, stay consistent.\n\nHope this breakdown helps anyone thinking about starting something small.",

It began pretty\ncasually, just helping a couple of students who wanted to learn basic chords and rhythm.\n\nAt first, I looked at it purely as a side gig. But after a few months, I realized how much I actually\nenjoyed it. Watching someone go from struggling with their first G chord to playing full songs\nis one of the most satisfying things I have ever experienced.\n\nThe schedule is flexible, the pay is steady, and it never feels like work. I usually teach around six\nto eight hours a week, and that easily covers a few bills. More than that, it gives me a creative\noutlet outside my day job. There is something about teaching music that keeps you grounded\nand reminds you why you loved it in the first place",

You're 100% right—most valuable online skills take real effort to build.\nThe best strictly online business I've found (and the one that's working for me) is building 'faceless theme pages' on Instagram.\nIt's perfect because all the 'effort' you put in (like finding great content for a niche you love) isn't wasted. You're building a real digital asset that can pay you for years. And it's 100% done from a computer.\nSince you've got time to put in, the key is just picking a niche you're super into.

      "selftext": "I’m just an average person who keeps burying myself in my life. Two hours ago, I suddenly realized I had been in Gap for two years, but my deposit hasn’t decrease much. This matter is quite interesting and beyond my understanding, so I'll do a self-reflection and record it.\n\nFeel free to discuss and share knowledge about making money.\n\nBefore deciding to take the Gap, I had some “f\\*\\*\\* you money” money, enough to support around five years of personal life. I thought the Gap was necessary because at the time, the industry I was in wasn’t going to be my career for life, so I spent my youth searching for a second income source.\n\nDuring the entire Gap period, my requirements for myself were:\n\n1. Try different industries, drop old thoughts, and let new ideas develop.\n2. Don't be so focused on money-making projects, but more on choosing projects based on interest.\n\nThis is my understanding of the Gap: not fight for traditional success or development, but to give myself a period to look at the world and understand the world.\n\nThe following are the side jobs I did during my 2-year gap:\n\n1. Barista: I usually look for coffee shops I like in my city, and if there’s an open spot, I’ll take a part-time job there. I prefer cafes with unique interiors and interesting customers, it makes work feel less tiring. But to be honest, this job can be physically demanding, and the pay isn’t great.\n2. Account Executive in Advertising: The reason I got into this is that my previous job was related to the ad industry, so I already had some clients who started reaching out to me for freelance projects. It feels a lot freer than working for a company, but it also requires more self-discipline and planning. I mainly handle client communication, content planning, and project follow-ups. It’s not physically exhausting, but it’s still pretty draining, classic agency life haha.\n3. Stocks &amp; Funds: My investment strategy is pretty simple. I use half of my capital for short-term trades in stocks I’m familiar with, usually making about 1–8% every two months. The other half goes into areas I’m less familiar with, but I try to analyze candlestick charts and follow the news daily to predict trends. Since I’m still learning, the results are pretty average, probably below what a rational investor would typically earn.\n4. Youtuber: I generate story outlines using ChatGPT and make videos with MagicLight. The workflow is pretty simple, which allows for regular updates, and it’s a high cost-performance side job. There were times I was anxious about data, but then I realized I couldn’t control the flow. Learning some tricks and posting on different platforms helped me create more engaging content. The results were decent, and I’m also exploring new ways to monetize this account.\n5. DJ: I have some friends who make music, and we often hang out at clubs together. I’ve always been interested in making music too, but I never had time to learn when I was working full-time. So during my gap period, I studied some DJ basics and started working part-time at a small club I really like. I love the job, though I often worry I’m not good enough yet — but surprisingly, it actually pays pretty well.",

No, they are not more than a couple of bucks here and there.\n\nHowever, I'm with the mindset that 1$ I get passively is one dollar I don't need to work for, which is a win in my book. For example, cashback programs are a must. I use Trading212 because it's the best one easily avaliable to me (hmu if you want an link) but there are others out there. I use \"invest cashback\" option which would in theory generate more passive income over time, too. High yield savings for any money you will need soon but you don't need at the moment. I also have a post on my profile for Microsoft Rewords. Another one is renting formal clothing, I rent a dress through a local service. People get it for special events and then return it.\n\nDon't expect wonders from low effort no investmant incomes. However, they do stack up and are petter than nothing.",

      "selftext": "What 40 Days of Writing Taught Me\n\nwell.... we are starting off on the wrong foot. It is actually only 39 days but I didn't wanna wait another day to write this out as it's fresh in my mind. SO here we are on day 39 of writing everyday. 40 just sounds better in the header. It made you click didn't it? \n\nI’ve written every single night for 39 days straight.\n\nAfter work. After my kids went to sleep.\n\nJust me, my laptop, and my thoughts.\n\nHere’s what I’ve learned; the stuff that actually matters 👇\n\n  \n1. Don't wait to start. Start today and figure out what you wanna write about after writing a few. I still don't know what i wanna write everyday I am just writing. \n\n2. 66 days builds a habit - I see why this is true.. I'm almost at day 66 and I don't plan on stopping\n\n3. I write at night so it has been added to my routine. Which is nice because i never know what i'm writing about each night. \n\n4. No need to moitvate myself. Now i ust pay a game with streaks. Consisetency is now my motivations. \n\n5. I have had 5 or more days with no new subscibers. But i kept going and never stopped. \n\n6. I only focused on writing. Now the rule is simple. I can write anywhere else so tonight i'm doing this reddit post. But I have to write. No building a saas, new product etc. No more shiney obects just focus. \n\n7. Fail fast. I wrote about 7.... different topics the first 10 days. I learned quickly that i shouldn't focus on one thing. I stopped wasting time updating my landing page. Now i keep it very generic. \n\n8.  One idea = 10 posts (I wrote about it in an issue. bascially i'm taking 1 newsletter issue and publishing it on X, Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, Youtube, Medium, and a few others. \n\n9. Don't sell. The issue I wrote that said I wrote a book(even though it was a free one) didn't get open nearly as much as my average. Only 15% opened that email because they most likely thought i was selling them something. \n\n10.  Automate the boring parts, not the marketing parts.\n\n11. You won't  figure out what you wanna do unless you do a bunch of things. \n\n12.  Test your audience with content just like a comedian does. Track who visits your site and see what social channel brings in the most refferals then triple down on that one \n\n13. If you wanna write about the latest trending topic. Make sure to have it flow into your day to day writing not just talk about it only. Tell a story behind it. \n\n14.  My kids don't care about followers, they just wanna hang with daddy. Make time for those you care about.  Great businesses don't make you work 24/7. They let you sleep and enjoy life. \n\n15. Help others instead of being helped. It's alot more reasonable for people to see you are making an effort then asking for it. Message that famous person, give them suggestions without pluging your stuff. \n\n  \nHope this helps. Yea there is formatting errors and spelling errors but I'm not going back to proof read it. ",

      "selftext": "I’ve put years into side hustles, and I’ve come to realize they’re not as profitable as I once hoped. Over the years, I’ve come across so many “get rich quick” schemes, and I can confidently say about 50% of them are scams. The crazy part is that the people buying into these schemes don’t always realize they’re the ones being sold. The sellers often pretend to be buyers, making it seem like a legitimate opportunity. But really, the whole thing is just one big scam where the buyers are sold the idea that they’re going to make money while the scam itself just keeps going.\n\nWhat’s worse is that the legit side jobs I once relied on are starting to disappear. Freelancing gigs that used to make sense are now being taken over by AI. More and more tasks are being automated, and it’s only going to get harder for those of us trying to make a little extra money.\n\nI’ve found ways to keep some things manageable by using AI tools to streamline my work. Genstore is one of the tools that’s really helped me. I was able to get my store up and running quickly, leaving me more time to focus on what really matters like interacting with customers and getting their feedback.\n\nIf your side hustle feels overwhelming, this is where AI and humans really work well together. It’s about working smarter, not harder. AI has its limitations, but tools like these help you focus on the important stuff while saving you time and energy.\n\nBuilding a business is tough, but it also creates opportunities to find creative solutions that others might not have thought of. Finding ways to make your process easier can give you a serious edge. If you haven’t made the shift yet, now’s the time.\n\nLet’s keep the conversation going. If you’ve tried something similar or are thinking about it, I’d love to hear about it. Adapting is key right now, and it’s one of the most valuable skills we can have.",

Even though my college may have moved on to another book or another edition and refuse to buy it back, other colleges somewhere still used them. I would sell on Amazon and eBay. It was a pretty lucrative and, basically, paid for food, gas for my car, phone, and utilities.\n\nI stopped because textbook companies started including one time access codes to their website with their textbooks. These codes became a necessity as they had modules that teachers used for homework and a digital copy of the book. Since these codes were one time use and standalone code cost about the same as the textbook+code bundle, used textbooks became harder and harder to sell and was no longer worth the time to do it.",

Amazon takes a chunk out of each book so you need to be selling books for around $15 just to make 9 bucks or so.  And then take out whatever you paid for the book.  The helpful thing with Amazon is that there is a Seller app, so you can scan UPC codes and see what the sales ranking is.  But some new books that are not very good start at a decent price but then plummet and you are then selling it for a few bucks, and you make nothing.",

[Niche Job Boards](https://sitefy.co/product/remote-job-platform-saas-for-sale/)**  \n- **Revenue Streams** Job postings ($100–$500 each) AdSense ($500–$5k/month) sponsorships and premium memberships.  \n- **Effort Required** Heavy upfront work (6–12 months) then ~80% passive.  \n- **Avg Monthly Profit After Scaling** $3k–$20k across multiple boards.  \n\nI know *yawn*. But unlike crypto pumps or sketchy affiliate schemes job boards solve a real problem (employers need hires job seekers want opportunities) and scale predictably.  \n\n### **Why Most Passive Income Ideas Fail**  \n- **Freelancing** Active income disguised as passive.  \n- **Crypto/Stocks** More gambling than a business.  \n- **Print on Demand/Dropshipping** Saturated and reliant on constant marketing.  \n- **Affiliate Marketing** Requires relentless content creation or paid traffic.  \n\nJob boards aren’t sexy but they’re **recession resistant automate friendly and compound over time**. My biggest board now runs on 2–3 hours of maintenance per week.  \n\n### **Want to Try It Heres the Hard Truth**  \n- **Pick a Niche You Understand** (e.g. \"Remote DevOps Jobs\" beats \"General Tech Jobs\").  \n- **Expect 6–12 Months of Grind** before meaningful income.  \n- **Monetization Levers** Job listings (highest $) ads paid newsletters recruiter partnerships.  \n\n**Question for You** Whats your most reliable passive income stream? (And if its crypto no judgement I’ve been there.) Drop it in the comments!  \n\n*(No course to sell no hidden agenda just sharing what finally worked after a decade of trial and error.)*",

Started a niche blog in pet supplies (specialized gear for a particular pet type). Figured it'd be easy - write reviews, slap affiliate links, profit, right? Yeah... no.\n\nMonths 1-4: The delulu phase  \nWriting 2-3 articles per week. Checking Google Analytics every 5 minutes.  \nTraffic? Maybe 10 visitors/day, half were probably me refreshing 💀  \nRevenue? $23 over 4 months. I made more finding a $20 bill on the street lmao.  \nMonths 5-8: The reality check\n\nStarted actually learning SEO instead of hoping Google would magically find me. Turns out you can't just write and expect to rank. Who knew? (Everyone except me apparently)\n\nMonths 9-11: The pivot\n\nStopped trying to be an SEO expert and outsourced the heavy lifting. Used Fatjoe for link building 'cause spending 15+ hours/week on outreach to get ghosted by 97/100 people wasn't it.\n\nCurrent stats (Month 14): Traffic: \\~400 visitors/day. Revenue: $800-900/month. Time investment: 5-6 hours/week. Total articles: 67.\n\nWhat moved the needle:\n\n1. Long-tail keywords (not \"best dog food\" but \"best grain-free food for senior dogs with allergies\")\n2. Actual link building from relevant sites\n3. Product roundups convert way better\n4. Patience (nothing happened for almost a year)\n\nThe weird part? Articles from 8 months ago are making money now. You do the work today, maybe it pays off in 6-9 months. Or doesn't lol.\n\nMy advice: Don't expect fast results. Add 6 months to whatever timeline you're thinking. Learn basics, delegate the rest. Long-tail keywords are your friend. Track everything.\n\nAnyone else grinding on niche sites? I feel like everyone either gives up in month 3 or becomes a millionaire and I'm just out here in the middle lmao",

WFH has been harder nowadays, lots of people returning to the office, and if an opportunity does come up, there are thousands of applicants.\n\nI don’t know what country you’re in, and that matters a lot, because job opportunities vary heavily by region. For example, where I live there are call centers that are constantly hiring. They usually have a very high turnover rate, so they’re almost always looking for people.

Flippd it for like $800 and was hooked. The hunt is genuinely fun and margins are solid when you know what to look for. But sourcing is where I'm stuck. When Im scrolling fb marketplace or mercari looking for collections, I can't organize anything properly. Everything is just mixed together with no useful filtering.  \n  \nThis morning I spent an hour and a half trying to find available collections within driving distance that aren't overpriced. i just want stuff posted in the last 3 days, within 30 miles, under $500 but there's no way to cut through the noise. Half the listings are already sold or people posting single figures when I need lots.  \n  \nThought this would be quick coffee break checks but I'm losing entire mornings to it.",

I'd find alot of cheap stuff in them, but also would find statues, collectible figures, games, etc, high quality stuff.

This is why all my other credit cards have a limit of $15k to $30k, but Capital One still has me stuck at $7k despite it being my oldest credit card (12 years), fully paid off each month, no late payments, everything perfect. And everytime I try to increase my credit limit they either reject me or give me $500.\n\nThe bucket system is horrible. Basically, it means that if you apply for a Capital One card with a 680 credit score, you're stuck there permanently. It doesn't matter if your credit score is now 820 like mine is (basically perfect, 1% utilization with $90k max credit.) Your score when you apply is your permanent score.\n\nI know this is somewhat unrelated, but fuck Capital One (ironically I use their Chrome extension for coupons anyway lol I was too lazy to switch to Honey.)",

It wasn’t a fortune, but it added up to about $100 in a month, and the sales kept coming even when I wasn’t touching anything.\n\nPhotography used to dominate these platforms, but AI has taken over that space. Right now, the real opportunity is in areas AI still struggles with clean, editable vector designs and motion graphics with transparent backgrounds. Those take real structure and creativity.\n\nIf you’re new to this, here’s the foundation that actually matters:\n\n* Learn how to make proper vector files (icons, shapes, or simple illustrations).\n* Learn basic motion graphics  how to move layers and export clean animations.\n* Study what’s trending in marketplaces before you upload.\n* Be consistent; upload small batches regularly instead of random drops.\n\nI put everything I learned into a short PDF guide that explains the workflow and lessons in detail.  \nIf you’re interested or want to know how it all works, just DM me.",

Basically, whenever a stock reverse splits, there is a chance that it rounds up. The round up is where we make the profit.

      "selftext": "I started using a cashback app, there are a lot of them honestly, just to see if it worked, I wasn’t expecting much, maybe a few cents here and there, probably more hassle than it’s worth. But I figured I’d link it to a few stores I already use and just forget about it.\n\nNow it’s sort of running quietly in the background. I’ll buy something online, the little notification pops up, and a few weeks later I notice a few dollars added back. It’s not a big deal each time, but it adds up over time in this subtle way.\n\nWhat surprised me more than the money is how it’s changed my mindset around spending. I don’t chase deals or buy things just because there’s cashback. If anything, I’ve started pausing before clicking “checkout.” Every purchase now has a small moment of reflection like, do I actually need this, or am I just reacting to a sale?\n\nIt’s definitely not a get-rich thing, but that small pause has become the real reward. The cashback itself is nice, but the awareness it built feels even more valuable. Kind of funny how a small experiment in saving ended up turning into a quiet spending habit reset.",

I have worked in bpo before and have done some freelancing work like ssm, and canva designs and created some portfolios for others too. I can do some basic editing too. \n\nJust wanna earn 5-7k a month. It's really hard to ask my parents for money when they are already working hard. \n\nSo, if you guys have some ways or websites which pay you. Help this brother out of yours.\n\nThanks in advance 🥺",

          "body": "As someone who works in AI, and have worked remotely since 2017,  I want to make a suggestion...\n\n\nDiversify. Don't stick to one field or one focus you want to do. I've taught English online, content moderation, worked for Real Estate agents, social media algorithm analysis and now AI training and language processing. (A lot of these jobs and companies aren't available anymore so I really can't guide people to remote work).\nMy college background was in microbiology.  None of these fields.\n\n\nI can't tell where AI is going to actually be useful for reducing human workforce jobs (it's failing a lot more than most people realize) but a lot of them will likely be those things people do remotely, such as chat support, coding, administrative tasks, etc. And it's not AI necessarily that is taking away work- it's the cheapskate CEOs wanting to charge the same amount but not pay employees. You'll be looking for those that want to pay for human produced creative output. And competition will be more intense for those jobs. But, as of right now, AI lacks the human aspect to art and creativity so most people can detect as being AI made. But as time goes on it's less and less apparent to the majority of people. There are podcasts, music, commercials and even 🌽 (yes, 🤦‍♀️ even that) that is improving every month to where I struggle to tell the difference when a year ago there were major issues. YouTube is saturated with AI created animation and video editing, likely not the best focuses right now.\n\n\nIf you want to work remotely be prepared to do what's needed, such as customer service phone work, and look for project based jobs on some of the bigger sites that will give you experience in multiple fields. It may be contract work with no guarantees or benefits or it might be employee based.\n\n\nIf you want to do creative jobs then you may need to be flexible to working in office. You will be competing against AI and being flexible to working anwhere may be an advantage. \n\n\nFor anyone looking to work remotely and are worried about AI I will say #1-that's a valid concern (I'm literally training myself out of a job) and #2- diversify what you do. \n\n\nNot trying to be a downer at all, I do think AI is limited with artistic and creative fields but it's what the employers and customers will pay for, will they settle for unnatural but cheap but human made and more costly? AI will never have that spark that makes art like a human... Hell even the chatbots acknowledge that. ",

      "selftext": "Hey r/JustStart! Two weeks ago I shared my interactive plant milk quiz site built with Claude AI. Here's the 14-day update.\n\n**Quick Recap:**\n\n* Niche: Plant-based milk alternatives (oat, almond, soy, etc.)\n* Site: Interactive quiz → matches users with plant milk → Amazon affiliate links\n* Built with zero coding experience using Claude AI\n* Started Oct 9, now Day 20\n\n\n\n**What's Changed (Day 6 → Day 20):**\n\n**Content Strategy Shift:**\n\n* Pivoted HARD to SEO content\n* Published 8 blog posts in 14 days (2x/week cadence)\n* Topics: \"Best Plant Milk for Coffee,\" \"Protein,\" \"Weight Loss,\" \"Kids,\" \"Smoothies,\" \"Keto,\" \"Oat vs Almond,\" \"Is Soy Milk Healthy\"\n* All 2,000-2,500 words with proper Schema markup, internal linking, affiliate links\n* Added \"Latest from Blog\" section to homepage\n\n**Traffic Evolution:**\n\n* Week 1 (Reddit spike): 240 users\n* Week 2-3 (post-Reddit crash): \\~5-10 users/day (mostly direct)\n* Reddit experiment today: Posted golden milk recipe to r/veganrecipes (294 views, low engagement - learned I need photos for recipe posts)\n\n**Monetization:**\n\n* **$6.36 total earnings** (up from $1.69 two weeks ago! 🎉)\n* **8 items shipped** (up from 1)\n* **102 Amazon clicks** (up from 30 in first week)\n* **7.84% conversion rate** (clicks → orders shipped)\n* Funny reality: People bought a winter jacket, 5x ultrasonic mouse repellents, a car phone mount... but ZERO actual plant milk 😂\n* Amazon's 24-hour cookie captures anything they buy, not just what you link to\n\n**Tech Updates:**\n\n* Added blog index page with green \"NEW\" badge system for latest post\n* Internal linking between all 8 posts\n* Updated sitemap after each post\n* Cookie consent + Google Analytics properly configured\n* All posts have affiliate disclosure boxes\n* Added homepage blog preview section (shows latest 3 posts)\n\n**Reddit Experiments:**\n\n* Tried helpful comment in r/vegan niche question thread (genuine engagement)\n* Posted golden milk recipe to r/veganrecipes today (learned: NEED PHOTOS for recipe posts)\n* Being careful not to spam or over-promote\n* Focusing on being helpful first, promotional never\n\n\n\n**Current Stats (Day 20):**\n\n**Content:**\n\n* 8 blog posts live (2,000+ words each)\n* Strong internal linking structure\n* All with Schema markup + affiliate disclosures\n\n**Traffic:**\n\n* \\~400 total users (lifetime)\n* \\~5-10 users/day (organic baseline post-Reddit)\n* Still waiting on first Google impression (sitemap submitted 7 days ago)\n\n**Monetization:**\n\n* $6.36 earned\n* 102 Amazon clicks\n* 8 items shipped\n* 7.84% conversion rate (solid for affiliate!)\n\n**Investment:**\n\n* Time: \\~27 hours total (12 hours week 1, \\~15 hours weeks 2-3)\n* Money: Claude Pro $250/year + domain $12/year = $262 total\n* ROI so far: -$255.64 😅\n\n\n\n**What I've Learned:**\n\n**Content Production with AI:**\n\n* Claude AI is INSANE for content creation when you give it structure\n* My workflow: I write outlines, Claude writes full posts, I edit/approve\n* Can produce a 2,500-word blog post in \\~90 minutes\n* Quality is solid (readable, well-structured, properly cited with Amazon affiliate links)\n* Internal linking happens naturally when you prompt for it\n\n**SEO Reality Check:**\n\n* Google takes FOREVER (submitted sitemap 7 days ago, zero impressions yet)\n* Reddit traffic is a drug - spike feels great, crash hurts\n* Building content library while waiting for indexing\n* Playing the long game now (this is month 1 of a 12+ month play)\n\n**What Actually Matters:**\n\n* Quality internal linking (connects all 8 posts)\n* Consistent publishing schedule (2x/week is sustainable for me with full-time job + family)\n* Actually helpful content (not keyword-stuffed garbage)\n* Patience (everyone says 6-12 months to see real results)\n\n**The Weird Amazon Thing:**\n\n* People click plant milk links but buy random stuff\n* That 24-hour cookie is powerful - captures ANY purchase\n* 7.84% conversion is actually solid for affiliates\n* But you need TRAFFIC to make it work\n\n\n\n**Mistakes I Made:**\n\n1. **Relied too much on Reddit early** \\- not sustainable, just a vanity spike\n2. **Posted recipe without photo** \\- Reddit loves visuals, learned that today\n3. **Expected faster Google indexing** \\- reality = 2-4 weeks minimum\n4. **Didn't build email list** \\- should've started Day 1 (still haven't)\n5. **No returning visitor strategy** \\- everyone takes quiz once and bounces forever\n6. **Obsessed over analytics too much** \\- should focus on content instead\n\n\n\n**Next 14 Days (Day 20-34):**\n\n**Content:**\n\n* Publish 2-3 more posts (\"Best Plant Milk for Baking,\" \"Is Oat Milk Healthy,\" \"Cashew vs Almond\")\n* Target: 10-12 total posts by Day 34\n* Keep internal linking strong between all posts\n\n**SEO:**\n\n* Wait for Google indexing (should happen soon... right?)\n* Monitor Search Console obsessively for first impression\n* Optimize based on what ranks (if anything)\n\n**Traffic:**\n\n* Stop chasing Reddit spikes (not sustainable)\n* Focus on building organic foundation\n* Maybe experiment with Pinterest (visual platform, recipe-friendly)\n* Consider other subreddits for genuine engagement\n\n**Monetization:**\n\n* Add more affiliate opportunities in existing posts (protein powders, kitchen tools, etc.)\n* Consider email capture for newsletter (finally)\n* Track which posts drive clicks (protein? smoothies? coffee?)\n\n\n\n**Questions for the Community:**\n\n1. **How long did YOUR first Google impression take?** (I'm at 7 days post-sitemap submission, getting anxious)\n2. **Is 8 posts enough to start seeing traction?** Or should I hit 20-30 first?\n3. **Anyone else using Claude/AI for content?** What's your workflow? Quality concerns?\n4. **Tips for reducing bounce rate on quiz sites?** Everyone takes quiz once and leaves forever - how do I get them back?\n5. **That 7.84% conversion rate - is that actually good?** Or am I celebrating too early?\n\n\n\n**The Reality Check:**\n\nI'm in the \"valley of death\" right now:\n\n* Reddit spike is gone ✅\n* Google hasn't kicked in yet ❌\n* Traffic is \\~5-10/day 📉\n* Grinding out content hoping it pays off in 3-6 months ⏳\n* $6.36 earned vs $262 invested = -$255.64 in the hole 💸\n\nBut honestly? I'm learning a ton, the content quality is solid, and I'm building something that *should* work once Google starts sending traffic. The hard part is the waiting and not knowing if you're wasting your time.\n\nThe AI workflow is genuinely game-changing though - there's no way I could produce 8 quality blog posts in 2 weeks without Claude. That alone might be the most valuable thing I've learned.\n\n**Site:** [**noncow.com**](http://noncow.com) (8 blog posts live if you want to check quality)\n\nHappy to answer questions about the AI workflow, content strategy, Amazon weirdness, or the emotional rollercoaster of month 1! 😅",

      "selftext": "A few months ago, I decided to take my side hustle more seriously. I’d been juggling my 5–6 job and my passion for building online stores, but I always told myself I needed more time, more knowledge, or the perfect idea before I could really start.\n\nEventually, I realized that “waiting to be ready” was just another way of procrastinating so I took action. I picked a niche, built my first store, and committed to learning through doing.\n\nIt wasn’t smooth at all.  \nI tested multiple products, redesigned the store more times than I can count, and even faced a few failed ads. But with each setback, I learned something new  from how to identify better products to how customer experience impacts conversion more than flashy design ever could.\n\nThe real turning point came when I started collaborating with a few people who were more experienced than I was. Instead of trying to do everything alone, I learned to build around teamwork, consistent testing, and small daily improvements. That’s when I began seeing consistent sales and growth not overnight success, but steady, measurable progress.\n\nWhat I’ve learned so far:\n\n* Execution beats endless planning.\n* Collaboration can speed up your learning curve dramatically.\n* Every failure hides a lesson  sometimes, that lesson is worth more than the win itself.\n\nI’m still learning every day, but looking back, I’m glad I stopped overthinking and just started.\n\nHas anyone else here experienced that shift  when you moved from planning to actually doing? I’d love to hear how it changed your results.",

      "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI'm working on my own business for 1.5 years now. Since then I embraced the digital nomad lifestyle somewhat but never fully committed to it. I basically travelled to one place and then ended up back where I started after a couple of months. My issue was that whenever you travel somewhere you are at a metaphorically blank page. If you like that good for you. For me I'm open to meet new people but it's an effort in a city where you never set foot before.\n\nOnce around 3-5 years ago I met a founder called Jan. He had what I would call the solution to this problem which never really left me but I never decided to act on it until today.\n\nHe was living in shared flat somewhere in Berlin with 3-4 other builders in a apartment which had a big living room, workstations setup and was just living the builders life but not in isolation but rather with other like-minded people.\n\nNow I had that every now and then but usually I work from home, sometimes in a co working space but none of these environments are very socially Inducive. As entrepreneur/builder or whatever you wanna call yourself you already commit to a life where you spent most of your time working alone on your idea/agency/projects.\n\nI want to replicate what I experienced a couple of years ago. I created a \"manifesto\" where I describe that experience and my ask is simple: I'm looking for 1-2 entrepreneurs who are open to join this experiment. If you see yourself in this document then hit me up with the contact details seen in the link.\n\nP.S Seems like I can't drop a link here. DM me and I can send you the document.",

      "selftext": "My barber does a great job cutting hair, but like most barbershops, the prices are a bit steep these days ($30+, plus tip).\n\nPersonally, my hair grows very fast, so if I wanted to keep it clean, I would easily have to get my haircut at least once every two weeks or so. It also doesn't help that I don't have the greatest neckline (i.e. it looks messy once my hair starts to grow out). However, paying that much money just wasn't something I was willing to do so I would wait longer than I wanted to between cuts.\n\nMy barber mentioned to me that business wasn't doing well. This wasn't a surprise to me because his shop was rarely busy.\n\nI have no barbershop experience but I do enjoy thinking of ways to make businesses more efficient and profitable.\n\nI suggested that he try this: offer basic (not bad) haircuts that he could do quickly &amp; efficiently, for a lower price. This would mean no skin fades and no use of scissors (I know this might sound crazy but a previous barber of mine only used clippers and it worked completely fine for my shorter hairstyle. He had longer clipper attachment guards so this isn't a matter of everyone getting a short buzzcut) because that also rules out longer hairstyles, etc.\n\nThere is a market out there for people like myself who are wanting basic haircuts and would get haircuts more frequently if the price was lower.\n\nHe took my advice and he has never been busier. There is almost always someone waiting in line for a haircut, and he has even implemented a numbering system. He charges $22 with no tip option. Although the price is lower, his chair almost always has someone in it and he gets through his haircuts much faster.\n\nSomething I want to stress again is that these are not bad haircuts. These are just simple (compared to some other haircuts out there) haircuts. Yes, I know cutting your hair at home is an option but that is irrelevant to this. There are many reason why someone may not want to cut their own hair, and also, some people do skin fades on themselves so a basic haircut does not automatically mean that someone can do it themselves.",

      "selftext": "Quick update to my previous posts about the nightmare client situation.\n\nContext: one client makes up $5k per month which is almost half of my revenue. They've been complete chaos, disorganized records, 2am receipt dumps, constant weekend emergencies. I posted asking if I should fire them and Reddit overwhelmingly said raise rates and set boundaries instead.\n\nI sent an email last week raising their rate from $5k to $7.5k per month and included an actual service framework with 10-day submission deadlines, rush fees for last-minute requests, communication hours Monday through Friday 9am-6pm only, and no more weekend work.\n\nThey went silence for a week. I was legitimately convinced they were ghosting me and started mentally preparing for losing half my income. Yesterday they called me and we had this tense 20 mins talk with lots of questions and pushback, but I honestly couldn't tell where it was heading.\n\nThis morning, I got their email response and I'm honestly conflicted about what to do. Screenshot attached.\n\nThey want to move forward but counter offer $7k per month instead of $7.5k. They're also pushing back on the timeline, saying they want to start with 7 business days deadlines instead of 10 and work up to it over the next quarter. And here's the one that's really bothering me, they accept the Monday-Friday 9-6 communication hours but want to discuss exceptions for quarterly filing periods where some weekend work might be necessary. They did acknowledge that they kinda expected this coming given how they've been operating, and they need 90 days to review how it's working. But I'm genuinely torn here.\n\nPart of me says take the deal because I won the principle, $7k is still a 40% increase, and some of their pushback seems reasonable for a transition period. Part of me says hold firm because I set $7.5k for a reason, that quarterly exception language feels like the exact slippery slope back to weekend chaos, and they're already negotiating boundaries before even accepting them. I'm leaning more towards the take the deal part.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/57jxtujji6yf1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=deb53723b067c6ddadac9b593edf1b46a22dc38f\n\n",

The fact they only shaved off a small discount means they see your value and actually want to keep you.\n\nIf you are unsure about the deal, analyze the market, check what others charge for similar work and how likely they would be to replace you. You were worried about losing 50% of your income, but you ended up increasing profit by 20% and simplifying your life.\n\nTake the $7k, it is fair.

LinkedIn is drowning in them. Twitter is full of \"building in public\" threads. But here's what's strange: actual product launches haven't increased proportionally. Neither have real SaaS companies reaching profitability.\n\nWhat we *have* seen is an explosion of:\n\n* Productivity tools for founders\n* Communities for founders\n* Courses teaching founders\n* Newsletters about founding\n* Tools to help founders build tools\n\nThe picks-and-shovels game has never been better. Why? Because the identity of \"founder\" has become more appealing than the reality of building a product. It's easier to buy a course about validating ideas than to actually talk to 50 potential customers. It's more comfortable to join a community than to write cold emails.\n\nThis isn't criticism, it's market observation. If you're actually building something real, you're now competing in a space where most \"competitors\" are just role-playing. And if you're selling tools to founders, you've found a market that's growing faster than the actual problems they're meant to solve.\n\nThe question is: which side of this do you want to be on?",

Most competitors are selling the dream, not the discipline. So, to answer your question, as a RevOps Architect, the answer for me is clear. I focus 100% on the chaos created by the noise. That huge market you described the one buying tools to solve problems they don't even have yet, here’s what. They all eventually hit the RevOps Failure Cascade. That's the moment their forecast becomes a lie, their teams start battling, and they realize the tools don't talk to each other. We don't sell the tool. We sell the certainty that the whole damn system won't break when you need it most. That's the only way to build a real company in this market. So now I am curious to know, if you're building a real solution, what's the one metric right now that your team consistently struggles to align on? Is it LTV, CAC, or pipeline stage conversion? I am curious to everyones view?",

      "selftext": "When I first started my business here in LA, I was that guy who thought contracts were only for people who didn’t trust each other. Everything we did was based on a handshake, a few texts, and “we’ll figure it out later.” It felt easy and honest until real money got involved. That’s when things started falling apart. A few missed payments, miscommunication over who owned what and suddenly everyone remembered things differently. I had to learn the hard way that paperwork doesn’t kill trust it protects it.   \nNow, every deal, every partnership, even small projects it all goes in writing. It makes things smoother and honestly saves friendships too.  \nAnd I’ve kind of started seeing it the same way in my personal life. Even something like a prenup isn’t about mistrust its just being clear early, before emotions or money complicate things",

But it took several years for her to 'get' it and that's only because I started making her do the books so she kind of understands. Nowadays she loves keeping up with the books and seeing the numbers climb. It's lonely. I try helping others get a business started but they usually want to do things their way and then when it fails they think I'm crazy. \n\nBack when I had service businesses no one understood and thought I was crazy.... until they saw our house at the time. Then they started asking questions... but they quickly fizzled out and I was back to being lonely. \n\nI remember back 20 years ago I kind of retreated from everyone. I let my workers run the businesses and all I did for like 30-45 days was read jokes online. One after the other after the other. \n\nThey say... It's lonely at the top.

Sadly, most tech meetups are shit, but if you can find one that is specifically focused on CEOs (meaning no service providers looking for sales or ICs looking to get hired), you’ll quickly find that there are MANY people doing the same work as you and experiencing the same wild ups and downs. \n\nLastly, even if you can’t talk to them about your work, you have to maintain relationships with other people. You need a friend group. There’s an old recovery phrase that “connection is the opposite of addiction”. We are social creatures. We need human interaction. Find a men’s group. Stay connected with friends and play videogames (in person!) or grab dinner or anything to spend time building great memories with other people. \n\nOtherwise, even if you become hugely successful, you’ll still be lonely and depressed. \n\nEdit: spelling ",

I'm 34 now, life is so different and I worked really hard to get here. But I remember when I was 27 I had just been listed as a 30 under 30 rising star of my industry in a national title and meanwhile my elderly mum and I were renting a horrible flat where the electrics were shot, there were mice in the walls and black mould. The imposter syndrome was real. My closest friend has an evening more amazing career trajectory and now makes $200k a year but she sleeps on the floor of a crowded house while supporting her mum with her family of 4 and her dad who's in the late stages of dementia. She looks pristine whenever you see her but behind closed doors she's trying to cover everything for her family. She works remotely and no one really know the reality of her situation. So believe me when I say everyone is just keeping up appearances.",

Our marketing team now quickly spins up landing pages, lead gens using Lovable/Bolt instead of having to wait for engineering or external contractors. It's not great for complex apps but it's great for marketing landing pages, and simple stuff! Basically you can clone your landing page for a dedicated/custom one for every ad etc very quickly! Easily save thousands of dollars we used to spend on contractors and a lot of time trying to coordinate stuff between teams!\n* Cursor/Windsurf: These help everyone in our engineering team write code atleast 2x faster. That's atleast $10k in savings per month I guess!\n* Frizerly: we used to hire freelancers on Upwork to do keyword research and blogs for our website to improve our Google ranking! Now their AI automates all of that for us! That's about $2k saved every month!\n* Google Nano Banana/AI Studio: Great to create marketing assets like photoshoots, change colors of products etc. This again is money we used to pay freelancers saved, on top of time ig!\n\nCurious what others have found as well!",

      "selftext": "**A bit of context**  \nI have been building mobile apps for a long time. I also ran an agency in Europe that shipped consumer apps. In the last two years I learned as much as in the eight years before. Consumer can work, but it is hard. There is a lot of competition. Many teams are funded. Good branding and design matter. Ads and store strategy matter. Vibecoding helps with speed, but it does not give you product sense or design skills. Most solo builders don’t have all of that.\n\n**What this is about**  \nI started building internal mobile apps for small businesses. These apps are private. The icon has their logo. The data is theirs. The app runs one important job their team does every day. Owners can build it. Or a builder can build it for them. The value is simple: fewer mistakes, faster hand-offs, cleaner records, money collected sooner.\n\n**What the apps do, in plain terms**  \nField work: the worker arrives, taps “start,” takes photos, collects a signature, taps “done,” and the invoice is sent.  \nStudios and salons: bookings are kept in one place, reminders go out on time, no double booking.  \nShops and wholesalers: scan items, update stock, get a clean export for accounting.  \nForms and compliance: fill forms offline, require all fields, get a signed PDF saved in the right folder.\n\n**Pricing and learning to watch**  \nSome platforms look cheap, then get expensive with seats, credits, or add-ons. Read what counts as usage. Check if you can export the project. Check who owns the data. Test the tool before paying. Plan time to learn it. One focused week now is cheaper than rebuilding later.\n\n**What must be solid**  \nThese are utility apps. One core feature must work every time.  \nIf the core is booking, the app must not lose state.  \nIf the core is notifications, they must arrive on time.  \nIf the core is inventory, scans must be reliable.  \nIf the core is forms, offline must work and signatures must stick.  \nNice screens do not fix broken behavior.\n\n**Ownership and scope**  \nKeep the brand of the business. Icon, splash, wording. Keep the data with the business. Keep roles simple. Decide if the app is only for staff or also for clients to see status or book. Fewer options means more use.\n\n**A simple way to build and improve**  \nMake a small version that runs end to end. Put it on the phones of the people who do the job. Watch where they get stuck. Fix the biggest problem. Ship again. Repeat once or twice. When it feels smooth for them, brand it fully and roll it out.\n\n**How to build**  \nI am technical, and for this kind of job I would not use Cursor. I would pick a mobile-focused vibecoding platform with three qualities: a good code model that handles real app logic (not only UI), built-in help for store tasks like signing, builds, TestFlight or internal testing, and App Store and Play submission, and clear pricing that stays reasonable without surprise per-seat or credit spikes. I use Vibecode App. It is free to start, the credit system is fair, and it is easy to ramp up. Whatever you choose, test navigation, state, auth, and push on real devices before you commit.\n\n**How to charge**  \nCharge a monthly fee that includes support and small improvements. Add a setup fee if there are integrations or data migration. Be clear on what is included. No surprise bills.\n\n**Reddit can help**  \nSpend time where your users talk. Read pain posts. Do not spam. Good places to start: smallbusiness, salons, truckers etc (there is a TON). Search for “no-show,” “double booking,” “inventory count,” “invoice delay.” Build the fix they describe.\n\n**Last tip**  \nIn many industries, just saying “we have a mobile app” still helps, even if the first version is simple. It opens doors. Then you earn trust by making one workflow work very well.",

I would love to hear what others have found but here are two that I often find people overlook\n\nI often find businesses either not using the blogs feature on their website or writing blogs without an intent.  With proper keyword planning using your Google Search Console data, blogs can help your website show up as top result for various queries people are searching for! These days with AI tools like Frizerly and Pulse that can automate both keyword research and drafting the blog itself, it's a no-brainer! Free organic traffic for life in the long run if you are consistent imo!\n\nSimilarly find the subreddits and forums your customers hang out and be an active participant there. Genuinely add value.

          "body": "Honestly, it's simple. The low hanging fruit is showing up where your audience already is. A lot of people think they have to start their own blogs/websites without realizing that to be able to get traffic with their website, they need to build authority and promote their content so they can then rank higher on search engines and get long term exposure that way.  \n  \nSEO isn't something you focus on at the begining, it's something you start doing as you scale up. Instead, what I like doing is using SparkToro to see where my audience is and then join relevant communities. Also, I like doing a competitive analysis to find gaps I can fill, targeting low competition topics first.\n\nFor example, say I'm in the cybersecurity industry and want to get more exposure. The first thing I'd do is search on SparkToro. According to SparkToro, the social networks most used by searchers of cybersecurity are:\n\n1. Github\n2. LinkedIn\n3. X\n\nIn that order. Meaning, me joining Facebook or Instagram would be a bit of a waste of time (or at the very least more expensive to reach the same audience). After all, those aren't the platforms people go to to learn more about cybersecurity.\n\nNow that I now which platforms to target, I'd research problems I can solve and content I can create. Tools like Ahrefs help you find keywords (topics) with low competition or at the very least, keywords you can compete for (taking advantage of the massive authority Github, LinkedIn and X have).\n\nThen it'd be a matter of filtering those keywords to spot the topics that actually have business value. Just because something has low competition, doesn't mean we should waste our time creating content around it. You need to know your target persona so you can create content specific for them.\n\nFocus on solving problems, not selling your products or services. What I mean is, your product or service should be a part of the solution to the problem they have, you shouldn't hard sell.\n\nLet me give you an example. Say you are selling antivirus software and the problem you seek to solve is removing malware specifically from browsers. You could target a topic like: \"How to remove the Yahoo search redirect virus\"\n\nAt that point, you'd know your target audience is someone who isn't very technical and is likely someone older, around 40-50 years old. Then you can write your copy using a copywriting framework like PAS (Problem - Agitate - Solution).\n\nYou can say something like:\n\n&gt;I had the same problem two years ago. I tried to search for stuff on Google but it would automatically redirect me to Yahoo to a random page. The biggest problem was I didn't know what was happening, but I talked to a friend who is more tech savvy and he recommended I do the following.  \nFirst, download the \\[product\\] extension. \\[this would be your product\\]  \nThen create an account and... \\[continue with the explanation\\]\n\nThat's it. After that, it's just a matter of promoting it. No matter how good your content is, if nobody sees it, it's useless. If you don't have an audience, use advertising to reach your target audience. Just promote the content you created in the platform you know you audience already hanges out in.\n\nThis is a bit of an oversimplification but that's what I'd do. It works every time for getting leads and selling products and services.",

You go onto Semrush and find most high volume keywords within the niche are low competition and much easier to rank for than say, a reporting SaaS software. \n\nPlus it is not too difficult to use AI and semrush to do great, relevant keyword research and then a tool such as Wincher ($30/month - cheap) to optimize your various landing pages for the best keywords.

          "body": "Many people will tell you \"**to give value**\" before you take, But many people overestimate What is required to make a connection in the first place. what I mean is people often think they need to \"Build someone a website\" or \"Offer them your area of expertise\". But the truth is ***most people don't know what they want***, but what most people want Is to see *\"any signal\"* That you are **trustworthy, Loyal, And a safe bet**. And you can signal many of those things By simply **showing up and being a positive force** in whatever they're doing. This can be as simple as finding three people in your industry, across whatever platform you desire, discord, LinkedIn, Hell even Twitter. and then consistently reaching out to them on their posts, encouraging, offering your perspective in a positive way, and sometimes even trying to offer value, But I find encouragement works the best. If you persistently do this for around three weeks, *then they'll start to notice you*, And so long as what you ask for is reasonable and at a small enough level, Many will offer you a helping hand because of your encouragement. (Think: Hi \\_\\_\\_\\_, I am Starting to Build my First Webpage, could i tap into your experience and could I show you &amp; could you tell me if i\"m on the right track?) then After they do that small ask, **offer them a list of thing your willing to help them with Because of what they've done for you**, make sure it is a list of thing they might find valuable. *The funny thing is they might never take you up on any of these things*, But what you've done is shown that you're willing to reciprocate, That when something is done for you, you are fully open to doing something for them and in turn this **builds trust, loyalty, And assures them that you're a safer bet** than a stranger when they might need a favor. It's also just a really good method of building rapport with anybody.... \n\nI know this is a more analytical Approach than you might have been looking for, but being an overly emotional person such as myself, I find things are almost always simpler when you break them down to the actions you need to take, And why those actions result in a meaningful connection with another person. it makes things clearer and more easy to act upon.   \n\\~Anyways I hope this was helpful my friend, please take care and good luck in your journey to make connections!",

Signup for freelance work websites like upwork,etc (start with 2,3 popular and trusted ones)\n\nNow comes trust which will be your biggest entry barrier in any field. To build trust\n1. Reddit- start posting and commenting on your niche sub reddit(genuine help is what you are supposed to do, do not sell your services, remember you are here to build trust)\n2. Linkedin- start posting 3x a week for 2 months, see what kind of posts are working and then double down on it, your post should resonate with your ideal customer base.\nWhile you do that you can simultaneously start approaching people on LinkedIn and people on sub reddits if they require your services. What their immediate pain points are that you can resolve with your skill set.\nRemember while you create content you are supposed to engage with other people's content especially who are doing well in your field of service.\n\nApproach method:\nStart DM ing people who interact with your post and introduce yourself and what you do, do not sell them anything, yet.

And for those still figuring it out (like most of us), just know you’re not alone in feeling overwhelmed. Sometimes the most entrepreneurial thing you can do is give yourself permission to slow down and build something that lasts.\nHere’s to small steps, quiet wins, and staying in the game long enough to see them compound.",

(I.e. if you are a successful entrepreneur, tell me your life story through a work-life balance lens.)\n\nDid you work super hard in the beginning, then take it easy once business started booming?\n\nHave you always worked hard? For like 10+ years?\n\nHave you had periods where you worked super hard and periods where you didn't work super hard?\n\nHave you always had good work life balance? Did you manage to enjoy life while building the business?\n\nDo you think that some long periods of relaxation/introspection/travel have helped you clarify what you wanted to do/learn? Or do you just view them as wasted time?\n\nI don't mind working my butt off (forever if I have to)...\n\nI just want to know what the standard is. \n\nHow much \"life\" do I have to sacrifice?

      "selftext": "Hi,\n\n**Background**: I was doing well at my job. It was a newly launched staffing agency based in NJ. At that time, it had no clients. I worked there for about 3 years and established the brand.\n\nThen, I decided to work for my own business, I resigned on Sep 26. On October 1st, I started my own marketing agency.  \nI registered an LLC and secured a few projects in the first month. They were small companies with less than 10 employees, as I wanted to start with smaller ones.\n\nI am into lead generation and have about 15 years of experience, so lead generation is like a daily task for me.\n\nAll my 5 clients want to grow their businesses by getting more customers. They don’t care what I am doing, what methods I am working on, or how much social media is helping. Nothing. They just NEED MORE BUSINESS. That’s it.\n\n  \n**The Real Struggle Starts Here:**  \n  \nTo deliver the desired results, I have been spending 8 to 10 hours daily, thinking about new strategies and ideas. I have dedicated one whole day to each project. On Saturday and Sunday, I review the past work and make strategies for the next week.\n\nThere are no off days, no relaxing days, no holidays. I get up in the morning, open my two laptops, and the same process starts again. I hired many resources and employees to share my work, but they could not meet the clients’ expectations.  \nSo, my employees just follow my instructions. These are low-paying projects, that’s why I cannot hire experienced people like project managers, etc.\n\nFurthermore, due to this stressful workload, I couldn’t market my own agency. Its social media pages are inactive.  \nI used to write on Quora and had millions of views there, but now I hardly post once a week.\n\nAfter all expenses, I am earning less than $500 per month now. That means around $6,000 per year, while this was the amount I used to earn every month earlier, working only 8 hours a day, no stress, full 9 hours of sleep, and a peaceful mind.\n\n**The only positive thing I have achieved here is the happiness of my clients. They are getting the leads they expected from me. In fact, my clients love me, and I love working for them.**\n\nBut I think I cannot take this stress anymore.\n\n1. Either I have to choose decent clients who can pay me what I truly deserve,\n2. Or go back to a full-time job again and offer part-time marketing consultation.\n\n**What I learned**\n\n1. Every business wants more clients, not more noise. That’s what I help them get, real, measurable growth. Just wish I had more time to do the same for myself.\n2. Sometimes, chasing freedom ends up costing peace. But even if it’s tough, I’d still choose my own path, because lessons like these can’t be learned in a 9-to-5.\n3. Skills in your field+time management = SUCCESS\n\n ",

          "body": "I recommend building out pro forma financials to see what the numbers need to look like to get you paid what you need in X months. What your margins would likely be. What salary you need. Once you know your revenue target, you can try to back into how many clients at $X per month you'll need. If you have $500/month clients and you need $10,000/month in revenue to drive the comp you need, you'll need 20 clients at that rate. If you can start landing larger clients, say $3,000/month, you only need 3-4. \n\nWhen I started my accounting business, we started with startups that seemed cool at that time. We quickly realized to grow to the size we anticipated with our businesses, we'd need way too many $300/mo type bookkeeping engagements. That's a hell of a lot of work. Often times, smaller clients still have a lot of asks. So we quickly realized our ideal customer profile needed to shift. The level of service we expected to deliver was not meant of for startups. It was 7-figure businesses. \n\nSo you're on the same path as most new business owners. You take on small gigs across various industries and don't get paid much, if anything. You're sacrificing a salary to build your service lines and learn what does and does not work. You're working in the business, not on it. \n\nYou'll want to shift from doing the work to having people do the work. They'll never be as good as you when you're small. You need to scale to get out of that challenge. Read the eMyth book to learn more about working on versus in. I also recommend Fix This Next. That will help you determine where exactly you should be spending your time. Most likely, it will be your sales funnel.",

Outsource small, repetitive tasks.\n\nSecond, you may also find it worthwhile to look into 'Arbitrage'. \n\nYou hire another company to generate the leads - you enrich them or whatever your deliverable requires, add your markup, and in turn provide the polished lead to your client.  \n\nI built an entire side business of providing leads to other companies, some paid by the lead and others by monthly retainer (Larger projects). \n\nIt's not easy - you will need to source and thoroughly vet lead providers while constantly monitoring quality, but the model does work.\n\nHope this helps!",

Keep increasing prices until you're getting no after no.  \n\nBuild case studies. Get out in the world and network. Meet people. Build relationships. I don't care what year it is nothing beats in real life relationships for early stage growth &amp; sales in a service based business. \n\nGet feedback on your local chamber of commerce from current members(use their directory to call people who are on it and ask them if they have a few minutes to share their opinion....guess what after you've started talking they'll be curious what you do. Now they know 😏.). Maybe join a few of them. Put in major effort. One or two might suck but damn if one works out you'll find yourself a few new customers. Nail down your local SEO. Grow from the inside out geographically.\n\nFind local founder meetups, happy hours etc.\n\nOnce you're doing that be active on LinkedIn and don't post AI garbage. Post actual valuable content and really give people a window into running your agency. Let them be a part of these wins and losses (not client wins or losses but yours as a founder, things you've learned, share stories). Share your plans, strategies you're using to find clients and generate leads for yourself and clients. Bring them in your world.\n\nAnd use your lead generation skills. I know it's scary to spend a budget in the early days. But once you've found a bit of security by attacking things old school use that money to pour some fuel on the fire. \n\nGet creative on some fun campaigns that don't cost ad spend dollars.

I have chased quick wins, had accounts shut down, and watched projects I poured a year into implode, so I know how perfectionism and fear of looking stupid can become a time sink. That experience taught me to trade future proofing for rapid learning, and that shift saved my energy and sanity. As a coach who has rebuilt after multiple setbacks and career pivots, I get where you are coming from. \n\nHere are simple steps you can use right now. Set a two week deadline to ship a tiny version that proves the one core value you think users need, then iterate weekly based on real reactions. Talk to many more people than feels comfortable, aim for dozens, and ask direct questions about the problem, willingness to pay, and how they solve it now. Remove features, not add them, focus on one metric that measures learning not vanity. Finally, create a brief accountability loop, for example share weekly progress with one trusted peer and schedule 30 minute user interview blocks on your calendar. You are already curious, resilient, and willing to learn, that will carry you farther than chasing perfection. I can help sketch a two week launch plan or a short interview script if you want. Remember, speed of learning saves you time and money. \n\nAustin Erkl - Entrepreneur Coach",

      "selftext": "A recent article by Brightpearl sheds light on how President Trump's tariffs on imported goods are impacting everyday consumer prices, particularly in the apparel industry. Using the example of a typical $20 T-shirt, the article explains how tariffs on imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh are driving up costs. Research from the Yale Budget Lab indicates that in the short term, consumers could face a 38% increase in clothing prices and a 40% rise in shoe prices. Even after adjusting buying habits, prices are expected to settle at an average of 17% more for apparel and 19% more for shoes.\n\nThis isn't just about higher prices at checkout. The ripple effects are felt across the supply chain, from manufacturers to retailers. Companies are adjusting their sourcing strategies, with some shifting focus to European markets or diversifying production to mitigate costs\n\nAs business owners, how are you navigating these changes? Are you adjusting your pricing models, exploring new suppliers, or reconsidering your product offerings? Let's discuss how these tariffs are impacting our businesses and share strategies to adapt in this evolving landscape.\n\nLooking forward to your insights!",

Out west near Hawtch-Hawtch there's a Hawtch-Hawtcher bee watcher, his job is to watch. Is to keep both his eyes on the lazy town bee, a bee that is watched will work harder you see. So he watched and he watched, but in spite of his watch that bee didn't work any harder not mawtch. So then somebody said \"Our old bee-watching man just isn't bee watching as hard as he can, he ought to be watched by another Hawtch-Hawtcher! The thing that we need is a bee-watcher-watcher!\". Well, the bee-watcher-watcher watched the bee-watcher. He didn't watch well so another Hawtch-Hawtcher had to come in as a watch-watcher-watcher! And now all the Hawtchers who live in Hawtch-Hawtch are watching on watch watcher watchering watch, watch watching the watcher who's watching that bee. You're not a Hawtch-Watcher you're lucky you see!",

If though you contacted them about a verifiably fake review and refused to pay they would without any subtlety explain that knowing this review was hurting a real business they would not only leave it up but promote it heavily via seo and other methods as well as search out other existing negative reviews or people willing to give negative reviews. \n\nYou either paid up or every search associated with your business be it name or market in your area would get the worst reviews presented high up in the results. \n\nI paid a lawyer and in the end found that they were legally untouchable and that it was much cheaper to just pay the extortion and move on than it was to try and fight it. \n\nIt was one of the things during a rough 6 year period that led me to see our legal system for what it has actually become.

You could pay a fee to yelp and they would investigate and potentially remove bad reviews.  The sales pitch went something like this, “that’s a nice business you have there.

          "body": "Yelp does exist because it primarily falls under the legal umbrella of free speech and public opinion. The platform definitely positions itself as a public forum where consumers can share their experiences. These experiences can be good, bad, or sometimes even fabricated. And this is because it's all user-generated content. We need to understand that Yelp isn't held directly liable for what users post under Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act. In simple terms we can say that they do provide the megaphone, but not the message. I would say it's perfectly legal for anyone to create a review of a business listing, even without the owner's consent, as long as the content doesn't meet the legal definition of defamation. So while Yelp's survival might seem insane to many of us, it's definitely not illegal. We should understand that it's just internet, unfiltered and unregulated.\n\nYou can ask your customers to share their experiences on yelp and this should help boost the review score. If you look at the review pages of largest companies in the world you will realise that the percentage of negative review is more then positive ones. This is primarily because happy customers usually do not care about leaving review. Fear is not reality. You will have so many positive reviews and just in some time that negative review will go down and your profile will shine again.\n\nSearch for Delete Yelp Reviews on google there are some sites that offer such services.\n\nI hope this helps.",

File a case in small claims court against Yelp and the villain then file discovery motions with Yelp regarding what they have for the listing. You may have to follow up with the ISP to identify the villain if they used a fake name. In most small claims courts, you need permission from the judge but they will likely grant your request if it's reasonable. Yelp will not like being sued and probably delete the information and block the villain.\n\nThis shouldn't take too long. File the case, request permission from the judge, file discovery, and go to court if necessary. If you drop the case against Yelp, then you can still go after the villain if you want compensation and revenge. I don't know how you prove damages but Google should have some guidance. \n\nIf you get a judgment against the villain, then collecting is another process but they can be forced to a deposition to provide their banking information and other assets. If they are a no show for this deposition, this will be civil contempt of court and they will have a warrant for their arrest. I believe they sit in jail until they comply or make bail promising to show. \n\nLiens and wage garnishment are yet another step in the process after deposition. You can attach their bank account and go after their wages and other eligible assets which another step in the paperwork process. Homesteads are generally exempt so you can't file a lien against it.\n\nThe best part about your case is these are what are known as intentional torts which cannot be discharged through bankruptcy. The villain is stuck with it forever and it's earning interest at the statutory rate which is 6% in my state.\n\nThis is an undertaking but if you have a penchant for revenge, you can go after the villain.",

Lots of folks have tried to “take them down” or litigate against them. Most of those people simply don’t understand how the tech works and like you don’t like the legality of hosting a site where people can post opinions. Conceptually not much different than people editorializing your business in the NYT or BBB, or even just going into a room and saying your business sucks or is great to 100 people. Word of mouth will happen with or without them and you’ll never know everyone talking about your biz nor be able to verify the validity of everything those people say. Bottom line, stop worrying about it. Be present. Do your best to run a great business. That’s it. The rest will come naturally.\n\nAnd frankly it’s the businesses who don’t want this kind of online presence whom I want to have it the most. It’s important to me to see a democratized record of quality and what to expect that the business can not tamper with or control the narrative of. While one or two reviews in 100 may not be valid, the vast vast majority are and overwhelmingly the review averages tell the right story.",

The work is steady and ive built up a solid clientele the past 6 years. \n\nPart of the job sometimes involves getting calls from farmers ive never dealt with inquiring about my prices etc. Cue sketch ball McGee. (SB for short)\n\nI get a call from a farmer not in my territory, which was a red flag. My service isnt super unique. You travel and hour or two any direction and you find another of me thats happy to do the work. Why wasn't he calling them?\n\nSays he cant get anyone to spread ag lime for him. Red flag #2. Has 120 acres he wants a whopping 4 tons to the acre. (Note, 1-2 tons an acre is most common, 3 is max if the ph is awful). \nI say sure ill do whatever you want. Asks for a quote, get him one, $30 a ton for purchasing the lime, trucking and spreading. $120/acre. He says sure sounds good. Start anytime. \n\nNow normally with my usual farmers this is no big deal. I spread, pay all the inputs, then bill them for all materials plus my time on top. Never had an issue. But something was off with him, but at the same time if he was real this was a big profit job. My dad whose much wiser than me told me to ask him for half up front. \"Tell him this is standard procedure with new clients.\" So I did. Dude said ok ill get back you. Never heard from again. Dodged a bullet i think. \n\nNow I know why no one in his area would work with him. ",

Everything was great until about six months ago or so.\n\nWe have a shared business account but we both also use our personal cards for business stuff pretty regularly cuz if you're at home depot or whatever it's very normal to use whatever card is in your wallet. The problem is that he's just TERRIBLE about telling me what he bought or sending receipts.\n\nLast month I'm going through our bank statements and I see all these random Venmo transactions I don't recognize at all. Turns out he's been paying contractors in cash and venmoing himself reimbursements without documenting anything. When I asked him about it he got defensive and said I should 'trust him' and that I should not worry about it which is fucking crazy because I don't have a single bill screenshot nothing to know what was paid\n\n We've been friends for 15 years but I also need to know where our money is going because I've worked so fucking hard for this business and I barely get 6 hours of sleep every SINGLE day (including weekends) for it to work. We're not a lemonade stand we have actual obligations and I'm pretty sure our accountant is going to murder us at tax time.\n\nThe worst incident was two weeks ago. He bought a 3.8k piece of equipment that we'd talked about but hadn't decided on yet. He just bought it. Using his personal card btw and he didn't mention it at all. I found out because the company that sold it called OUR business line asking about delivery and I had no idea what they were talking about and I had to play dumb on the phone\n\nWhen I confronted him he said he saw a good deal and didn't want to bother me and now I'm the asshole for being upset about an unauthorized 3.8k purchase? He says I'm being controlling and acting like his mom.\n\nI don't want to ruin our friendship but I also just can't run a business like this. Have any of you dealt with this? How do you set up financial boundaries with a business partner without making it weird?  \n  \nI'm sorry everyone for the long post but I'm not sure how to solve this and just keep the friendship at the same time",

You need a mechanism that handles these decisions, otherwise things will always remain problematic. \n\nWhat I've done with cofounders is have a recurring sync where business decisions are made. We capture clear action items on what to do next and make sure we both agree. Weekly has worked well for us. And we capture discussion points throughout the week for our next meeting and just bang them out quickly over 30 minutes.\n\nThere will be times when someone can't wait for the next meeting to make a big decision. In that case, you either need to have clear predefined/agreed upon roles for what sorts of decisions people can make solo. But you also need a mechanism for how to handle emergent issues. That's like just a text saying \"hey, need 5 minutes to discuss doing X.\" \n\n---\n\nFYI: that word _mechanism_ is key. You need an agreed upon way to handle decisions and what process you will follow. You want it to be consistent, repeatable, and clear to both people. Keep it light weight, especially if you are still getting the company stable. If he pushes back on this stuff, say you need to be in the loop on all company decisions as it helps you make better decisions as things shift. If he doesn't get that, then he isn't really interested in building a business... \n\n---\n\n&gt; When I confronted him he said he saw a good deal and didn't want to bother me and now I'm the asshole for being upset about an unauthorized 3.8k purchase? He says I'm being controlling and acting like his mom. \n\nResentment is the #1 killer of relationships.

I'm going to give you a basic rubric for a conversation, and I think you should think about using this when you're talking to your friend.\n\nWhat I'm going to tell you is a brief and incomplete synopsis of the book \"Rapport: the four ways of reading people\". The title is a misnomer - It's actually the result of two PhD psychologists studying terrorists to try and interrogate them better. They found a way of having conversations that keeps people in difficult conversations without them tapping out. It turns out that it works on terrorists, it works on teenagers, it works on my fiance now wife and it works on the people I have to interview for work. \n\nThe fundamentals of this kind of conversation are HEAR. Honestly, Empathy, a respect for Autonomy, and Reflect what you hear. \n\nFor example, the conversation may sound like this.\n\n\"Hi Jim. Listen, we have to talk about something. First, I want to tell you that I hate this kind of conversation - we've known each other for forever, and I feel like I'm picking a fight with one of my best friends, and that's not my intent (Honesty). I can imagine how what I'm about to say will make you feel too - as I said, It's not my intent to pick a fight or nothing (empathy). The fact is that this business can't be ran without better communication on purchases and expenses. The problem isn't the paying contractors in cash or you fronting the money, the problem is that there's no records, and that you've made some big purchases on your own. Let's talk about the first one. I don't think you're stealing anything, but there are tax implications and liability implications as well, plus it makes things 10 times harder to handle accounting on the back end, and we need to be sure we're making money. I know that it's paperwork, but at the minimum you need to be putting invoice numbers for every time you do a venmo transaction, and there can only be one invoice per transaction. Let's talk about the second one - That $3,800 is a big expense for a business like ours. I know we talked about it, but That is x weeks profit for our business.  There should have been consensus.\n\nNow I know what you're going to say. First, I'm not your mom. I don't do laundry, and in any case I'm more like your wife - The shit that you do affects me too. I can't make you work with me on these issues, but I hope to make you see that they actually are issues that affect profit and how we run this business going forward. I want to be able to keep working with you on this until we sell out and retire at 35 (respect for autonomy). What do you think? Do you think these are problems, and do you think there's anything needs to be done about them?\"\n\nThat turned into more of the wall of text then I wanted, but you get the idea. I recommend picking up that book and giving it a skim (It's highly repetitive in places), because the reason I can't give you a complete synopsis is that you need a diagram in the book.

We never had a real partnership agreement (just something we downloaded and signed) until we decided to incorporate. Four years into our partnership I was drowning. I was working my ass off while she was on paid maternity leave and working remotely from another state \n\nEventually she moved back to my state and we hired three employees. Suddenly she said we didn’t have enough to pay ourselves and the employees. How? We had dozens of clients and were really humming. So we skipped paying ourselves. But, while her husband had a job, I was a single mom of two. So every time we had to skip paying ourselves I choked harder\n\nEventually I needed to find a job or I’d lose my house. My partner was livid when I told her I was leaving. When we met with our attorney I learned that we were $30k in debt (this was 2007). So instead of getting paid for half the value of the business, I OWED the business my half of that debt to buy myself out. I was a single mom who hadn’t even made my full $24k salary that year (yes, that was low back then too)\n\nTurns out we’d been taking down payments and advance billing our clients but not paying our vendors. We had a huge leased office and lots of business loans. I take 100% responsibility for not paying attention to my business financials. I started a business with no business experience and I made some big mistakes and learned a hard lesson. I should have consulted a lawyer before starting the business, but I was afraid of the expense. I should have had a real partnership agreement from day one. I should’ve been more aware of the financial status of my company.\n\nUltimately, I took out a personal loan for $15,000 which I paid off within two years and subsequently ended up debt free a few years later. I don’t know what happened to her or the business and I eventually changed career paths\n\nI recommend you familiarize yourself as much as possible with everything about your business as quickly as you can. If your partner resists or doesn’t want you to see information that is a red flag, trust me. You need to review your partnership agreement and understand what legal options you have. If you have an operating agreement and your partner is in defiance of it then you need to consider legal options. this will be uncomfortable, but you don’t have to get angry or rude. Keep it cool and do your best to be respectful of your friend, even if he isn’t respecting you. Keep your head up a new what you can to get through this. Good luck!",

I’ve talked to a few small business owners through my MBA who went into business with close friends, and almost everyone said the hardest part wasn’t the business itself, but the partnership dynamics.\n\nIt sounds like you’re right to be concerned. What’s happening here isn’t about trust, it’s about transparency and protecting both of you. The best operators I’ve met handle this by putting SYSTEMS in place that make accountability automatic, so it doesn’t feel personal. For example, agree that any purchase above a certain amount (say $500) requires a quick written check-in even just a Slack or WhatsApp message before pulling the trigger. Make reimbursements contingent on documented receipts, like uploading a quick photo to a shared Google Drive folder. And if you can swing it, bring in a part-time bookkeeper or use accounting software like QuickBooks that both of you can access; having a third party involved takes the emotion out of it and adds structure.  \n  \nI know it’s tricky because you’ve got years of friendship layered into this, but a lot of founders say the moment they treated the partnership like a board relationship, things got healthier.\n\nYou’re not being controlling; you’re acting like an owner. The best way to preserve the friendship is actually to create professional distance WITHIN the business.",

Majority would have more invested &amp; preferably experience running the type of business. (Lenders also want the majority or manager to have experience + funds invested). You can split it anyway you can agree to. I was not majority by plan, I just happened to invest the most $ upfront. Luckily, I also had the best/most experience. We’d have lost entire investment otherwise). If you can’t agree on amount owned, another red flag. Don’t do it. I’ve seen co owners agree for years, then all the sudden someone can change &amp; wreak havoc. Some will do out of spite, tho courts look down on that. (lotsa case law decisions on ‘minority or majority owned close businesses.’ Courts tend to side with majority because they have the most to lose &amp; don’t do things that hurt their investment (on purpose).

Instagram/Tiktok isn't much better but I like to think of those more as algo-based galleries vs classic social media, so your interactions on them tend to be a bit more genuine. These platforms are their own can of worms too though, and they really aren't appropriate unless you're a business that is served well via short form video/picture posts (like trying to sell designer shirts or a \"viral product\"). I mostly use ours as a dumping ground for low effort content that is visible on our website, to give potential customers a sense of who we are rather than actually trying to go viral on it.",

They contacted me to say the necklace was dirty/mouldy and they wanted a refund. I kindly instructed them on a cleaning method, but they refused this suggestion and once again demanded a refund. I then offered them a replacement at a reduced cost, and they have also refused this offer and demanded a refund and have started to threaten me. I am really taken back by this situation, especially as it has been 5 years since they purchased this item from me, and the item was quality checked before shipping.\n\nDo they have a claim for a full refund after the lengthy time period? Worth noting, they are in a different country- one outside the EU. Any advice would be helpful.",

          "body": "There is a difference between a refund policy and a warranty.  Usually a refund policy is like 30 days, and may be store credit only, that type of thing. It enables a husband to buy a gift and return or exchange it if his wife doesn’t like it — meaning the purpose of it is to help you sell more.  Sometimes people will abuse these, the obvious example in your business being to wear something for a party or wedding and then return it or something. Anyway, that’s a return policy. \n\nA warranty is your guarantee that something is made with good workmanship and you will stand by it.  A pavé diamond should not fall out of a ring, for example, and if it does you will replace it maybe. A warranty can be time based or “lifetime” or whatever you decide but the important thing is workmanship. If the item is properly made and the person decides they no longer like it or want it, or they failed to care for it and it’s dirty, or whatever else that does not go to workmanship, it is not your problem to fix this at your expense.  Is the ring moldy because of workmanship?  Is it tarnished because it was improperly coated and the coating wore off (idk about this stuff, just hazarding guesses)?  If so you can repair. If the workmanship is on some dimension truly poor, you can offer a refund. It does not sound like this is the case. \n\nSome jewelers offer free cleaning for life.  This is a nice thing to do but also brings people back to your store maybe to buy more jewelry, so it’s not entirely motivated by generosity. \n\nWhy don’t you tell her, bring the item by, I’ll clean it and take a look at it and see if there’s anything wrong with it.  Clean it and make it look nice. Then say, there’s nothing wrong with it, so I can’t take it as a return. If it can be resold or has value in the precious metals, you can offer to accept it in exchange for a 40% discount on something else in the store or something, and give her those choices. \n\nThere is nothing she can threaten you with that is going to go anywhere in a court of law and I would ignore any such treats and stop responding to her if she won’t stop making them.  Again, this assumes you didn’t sell something of shoddy workmanship with a lifetime guarantee. \n\nYou should make your returns and warranty policies clear and in writing and print them on your receipts. ",

I can just imagine someone buying it on credit then making minimum payments or perhaps defaulted a couple times and now has an astronomical interest rate which they couldnt afford and couldnt even afford the regular rate 5 years ago. Its not like the item can be repo'd or foreclosed like a car or house. They probably are thinking that by refunding through that credit card would somehow undo that initial transaction and get them out of the huge financial debt that they got themselves in. Sadly it doesnt work that way. \n\nBut its jewelry and its been 5 years. So wouldnt the item still have value once its cleaned up and appraised? (Unless it was personalized with engravings or something.) Is there a chance its worth more now then when they had originally bought it? It wouldnt depreciate would it? They could resell it.

It's a fairly nice one. Probably worth $800 or $900.  Flaky hard drive, all told about a $200/fix for replacement drive and reload windows we or else I'm able to recover most of her pictures and other personal files. \n\nShe had also brought along her Microsoft office discs and a few other common applications. We went ahead and loaded those up for her too. \n\nShe brought it in on a love Monday afternoon in July, it was ready for her to pick up Wednesday afternoon.  We called her and left a message that it was ready. \n\nFriday we call again and she answers we confirm that she knows that her machine is ready. She said she would be by to pick it up in a couple of days. \n\nA week later, we call she doesn't answer. We leave her a message reminding her that her computer is ready. \n\nWe do that every week for about a month.  No reply.\n\nSo I tell the employees not to bug her and she will show up when she shows up.  August passes.  On September first I call and leave a message that am the owner of the shop and letting her know that under CA law if she doesn't come pick up her machine we have the option to sell it to satisfy the outstanding bill.\n\nShe calls back an hour later and says she will pick it up tomorrow..\n\nTomorrow comes and goes.  \n\nOctober first I Mail a copy of the invoice, showing an additional storage fee, and a note that if she does not pick up her computer within the next 90 days, it will be sold to satisfy the outstanding bill. \n\nTechnically I only have to wait 30 days  and that 30 passed at the end of August. \n\nNovember 1st I send out another copy of that letter with an additional storage fee and a warning that it will be sold in 60 days. \n\nDecember 1st another copy of that letter , storage fee, the warning will be sold in 30 days.\n\nJanuary 2nd I send out one that I will sell her machine for the amount due on her bill.  Unless she picks it up by January 10th.\n\nNothing..  i waited until Feb 1.  \n\nI  post it on FB with pics and all the specs, price ... The exact amount of her outstanding bill.\n\nI had my tech dump her personal files on a dvd just for sake of argument.  Then reloaded it with a fresh copy of Windows again so as not to include any of the customers personal files.\n\nLaptop was sold on Feb 2nd.  We included the software that she had brought with the laptop when she came in.\n\nFast forward to April 10th.  She shows up at the shop looking for her laptop...it's been 9 months from the time she dropped it off.  Fortunately I was there when she came in. \n\nI told her her computer was sold 2 months ago, for the price of her outstanding bill.  It took about 15 minutes and the arrival of the police department to get her to stop screaming.  \n\nShe of course wanted to file a police report saying that we had stolen her computer etc etc.  one of the cops asked about the whole thing and I gave him the nutshell version of the story above and showed him the invoices... He agreed that there was no crime here. \n\nWe offered her the dvd with her personal files which just enraged her further.  At that point, we're not even obligated to preserve any of her pictures or files.\n\nSo I hoped it was over at that point.... Silly me. \n\nShe called probably close to 50 times over the next 6 months...  And would start giving her sob story about how I had stolen her computer, she would beg various staff members to give her the name of the person that we had sold it to so that she could try to go buy it back from them.\n\nBasically standing instructions became if this lady calls they would direct her to me, at which point she would hang up.\n\nShe filed a complaint with the state agency that regulated our shop.   15-minute phone call and an emailed copy of the invoice, they dropped the investigation as without merit.\n\nShe kept calling about every other month for the next 3 YEARS..  On several occasions she got a new employee who would be concerned until they looked up her account... referred them to me or one of the more experienced techs... And she would hang up.",

I used to have this stress when I first started sourcing 8 years ago. But once you master all the fundamentals then any changes should just be a minor thing to you.",

Then tax season hits and my accountant asks for everything. I end up spending a weekend manually going through 12 months of bank statements, matching receipts, categorizing expenses, before sending it all to him. He charges $2k for year-end filing.\n\nThis year it finally caught up with me. I kept postponing the filing because I was dealing with other business challenges and ended up paying penalties to the government. \n\nI only have about 100-120 transactions per month including payroll, so it's not massive volume. My accountant asked $800/month for bookkeeping, but I think I'd still have to send him receipts, bills, statements, answer his emails etc.. etc..  so I'm doing half the work anyway.\n\n**My question:** Is there a middle ground between:\n\n* Doing nothing all year and paying penalties \n* Paying $9k/year for a bookkeeper when I'm still doing half the work\n\nAre any of you in a similar boat? What's working for you? Is monthly bookkeeping actually worth it, or are there tools/approaches that make DIY less painful?",

If you want bills and receipts, those things are an extra cost, and extra work for both me and the client. If you don't want as much back and forth, you can give your bookkeeper 'view only' access to bank statements, and they can log in and get those statements themselves each month. In that case, the only thing you might have to do is clarify a few transactions once or twice a month. Bills and receipts are a lot more work but can be optional depending on what your business needs, so if you're looking to do less admin on your end, you can provide your bookkeeper with view only access, and eliminate sortware-based receipt tracking (or track receipts only above certain amounts). You can also use a receipts-only email address that you and your bookkeeper both have access to, or use a receipts tool (i.e. Hubdoc) to streamline things. There are a lot of other options rather than manually managing every piece of paperwork that will make things a lot easier on your end. Good luck!",

We did this as a workshop in my company for anyone who might talk to clients about budgets/finances and it was immensely beneficial.  \n\\- MINIMUM BAR: put your transaction details in a spreadsheet  \n\\- Preferable: use an accounting system. Wave has a free version and it's a great place to start. Enter your transactions manually, and it will give you a proper balance sheet and P&amp;L. This will make things easier (read: cheaper) for your accountant to do tax prep. You can run invoices from here too.\n\nGrowing up a little:\n\n\\- Use paid version of Wave to automatically connect your bank account OR use another system that does the same (we use Xero, Quickbooks online is the market lead), just run invoices from whatever system you choose.  \n\\- Reconcile transactions once per week in the system, this is generally as easy as picking a category and clicking a button. For your size, should only take 15 mins / week. Get familiar enough with the process so that you can understand it for the next stage. Understanding debits/credits and how they work in a double entry accounting system, vs what types of accounts to use (asset/expense/liability etc..) will give you a foundational education that will help you later in your business as you grow it.\n\nDelegate:\n\n\\- Once you have a system in place, the basics working, and it's getting a little more complex and/or time consuming......get a bookkeeper.  \n\\- Cheap option: Virtual assistant from somewhere like the Philippines. This should get you the basic legwork done pretty easily without having to do anything yourself.  \n\\- More expensive: outsourced bookkeeper / service / agency: this is where we are now, we pay $2500/month and this includes payroll, bookkeeping, and a bunch of tax account management. Invoicing would be included but ours is a bit too project dependent to reliably outsource currently.\n\nTAX: I don't know where you are at specifically, but this is general advice for US based - the other advantage to a good bookkeeper is to find someone who can manage the tax accounts. Unemployment insurance, state by state accounts if you hire in different locations, and a bunch more. These are just awful to self manage.\n\nLast note: later on, a good bookkeeper can help you level up your financial management of the company. For example if you hire sales people, or some internal operations people you may want to categorize them differently to track a more accurate gross margin vs opex vs net margin. When you do this, reconciling payroll suddenly becomes more complex, which is why you need a good bookkeeper, it unlocks more capability as well as managing the mundane stuff you shouldn't be doing.",

It’ll make your life so much nicer especially if it’s someone you can trust and can help with payroll, payroll taxes, etc. \n\nI pay $2,500/month for our bookkeeper (she also does a couple other family business) and is 100% worth it.",

          "body": "[Edited For Fornatting]\n\nHey there. First off, mad respect for your drive to build this from the ground up on your own terms. I work in this space, and I completely understand wanting to shield your new project from personal opinions until it's stronger. It's a very common feeling.\n\nGrowing from zero while staying anonymous is a specific challenge, but it's 100% doable. It just means you have to be more strategic.\n\nSince you (the founder) are anonymous, your brand has to become the entire personality. Here’s a game plan.\n\n1. Optimize Your Profile to Be Your \"Face\"\nYour profile is now your entire first impression. Before you do anything else, make this solid.\n\nProfile Pic: Use a clean, clear logo. Don't use a personal photo or a generic stock image.\nUsername: Make it as close to your business name as possible.\n\nBio: This is your elevator pitch. It must be crystal clear. Use this structure:\nLine 1: What you do / Who you help. (e.g., \"Handcrafted ceramic mugs for cozy mornings.\")\nLine 2: The value you provide. (e.g., \"Daily inspiration • Pottery tips • Shop our drops\")\nLine 3: A Call to Action (CTA). (e.g., \"👇 Shop the new collection\")\nLink in Bio: This should go to your website (once it's ready). For now, you can use a free Linktree/Stan/etc., but a direct website link is always more professional.\n\n2. The \"Cold Start\" Growth Strategy (Getting 0 -&gt; 100)\nYou have no friends/family to tap, so you have to find your first followers \"in the wild.\"\n\nDO NOT: Follow 1,000 random people hoping they follow back. This gets you low-quality followers and can look spammy.\n\nDO THIS INSTEAD (The 10/10/10 Method):\nFind 10 \"competitor\" or \"shoulder\" accounts. These are accounts where your ideal customer already hangs out.\nGo to their most recent posts.\nLeave 10 genuine, thoughtful comments. This is the key. Don't just post \"Nice!\" or a fire emoji. Add to the conversation. If it's a potter, say, \"That's a beautiful glaze technique! Does it work well on stoneware?\"\n\nPeople will see your insightful comment, see your (now optimized) logo/name, get curious, click your profile, and—if your bio is clear and your content is good—they will follow.\n\nThis is the single best way to get your first 100 relevant followers who actually care about what you do\n\n3. Your Content Strategy (Faceless &amp; Valuable)\nYou need to give people a reason to follow you. Your content must provide value. Every post should either Educate, Entertain, or Inspire.\n\nReels are Your #1 Growth Tool: The algorithm pushes Reels to non-followers. This will be your main discovery engine.\n\nFaceless Reel Ideas:\nShow your product in use (a hand holding the mug, not your face).\nShow the process (packing an order, designing on your computer, sketching an idea).\n\nUse text-on-screen with a trending audio to share a quick tip.\nUse high-quality, aesthetic stock video clips (from Pexels or Canva) and add your tips/info as text overlays.\nCarousels are Your #1 Nurture Tool: These are great for your existing followers.\n\nUse them for tutorials, step-by-step guides, myth-busting, or sharing a list of resources. These get a lot of saves, which the algorithm loves.\n\nUse Canva: You can create 90% of your graphics and simple video content in Canva. It's all you need to look professional without being a graphic designer.\n\n4. How to Be Found (Hashtags)\nHashtags are how you tell Instagram what your post is about. Don't use massive tags like #business (100M+ posts). You'll be invisible.\n\nUse a \"niche-down\" strategy. In each post, use a mix of 10-15 tags:\n\nBroad (3-5): #[your_industry] (e.g., #pottery)\nNiche (5-7): #[your_specific_product] (e.g., #handmademugs, #ceramicart)\nCommunity (3-5): #[your_target_audience] (e.g., #pottersofinstagram, #coffeelovers)\n\nThe biggest thing is consistency. It's a marathon. You're starting on \"hard mode,\" which is slower, but it's so much more rewarding. You'll know that every single follower and sale was 100% earned by your own effort and the quality of your brand.\n\nYou've got this. Good luck.",

      "selftext": "The income is unstable, it's actually more stressful than the software development job I had, but I'd rather earn 1k a month with my own business than 4k a month for someone else. I just have a problem with authority and cannot work with a fixed salary\n\nIt is risky though, my only source of income right now is a custom data visualisation software I developed for logistics companies, they loved it so much they pay me 200-300 a month just for the subscription. The thing is, you still cannot buy a mortgage with this money because if 1 client churns you already lose a big chunk of the income, that's why I'm looking for other clients everyday trying to make other type of software, it's unstable and stressful, but I love the thrill\n\nI had saved up for 2 years so I can have a runway to start building my business.\n\nJust wanted to share this little thing in my life. fingers crossed, I'm trying to pivot to developing OEE software for factories or other software I can sell in a SaaS format, let's see how life turns out.\n\nEdit; For the people dming me asking my work, towing companies need an overview of their work, I take their data (incident coordinates, time it took, type of car, blabla) and visualise it with heatmaps, a filterable database of all their work, average calculations, trends, lots of stuff. I managed to upsell them a 2nd type of software and they all loved it, now one of them asked me to automate and digitalise their entire company which is huge, basically some management tools and a client portal where their clients can login and send orders.\n\nI'm a nerd so I easily make complex software like this within weeks (started as a game dev, became a software engineer, 10+ experience), the 1st version took 1 month and I basically turned it into a SaaS which I copy paste for other companies in this niche.\n\nAs a ''technical person'' its hard to run a business, its a human psychology thing, marketing and sales thing, and I really had to turn my brain 180 to be able to cold call, sell, write the perfect mails, convert people, following up etc. I was an introvert but I forced myself to cold call and now I LOVE talking to people on the phone and selling them anything. I'm starting to get the hang of it",

I also use credit to pay for materials, utilities, etc. Anything more is usually planned ahead of time or at least enough time for the ACH transfer to go through. \n\nThat way whether the money is going to get used, saved for taxes, or saved for major expenses, it’s earning at least something. \n\nWe also set our household up this way, too. Paychecks come in, transfer money for fixed monthly expenses into a monthly expenses checking account, a few bucks in personal checking, rest into savings.",

Months go by and he starts nagging at me for using it. A little frustrating but I figured I should get my own anyways if I’m going to need one for my business. Today I came into the warehouse and my power is out, I was charging my forklift overnight as I normally do. landlord says the circuit breaker for my unit is in another unit and I can’t access it. Now he’s suggesting I use a generator because “my unit only has enough power for lighting” how was I ever supposed to have a forklift if this is the case? I cannot run my business off a generator and he is very frustrating to deal with. It’s been 2 days now and the guy from the unit with the circuit breaker is not responding to me. Any suggestions on what I can do?",
